Why should it?  Device-mapper constructs a virtual device and
I think it's completely wrong for it to 'fake' a geometry.
Of course dm could recognise the ioctl - but the default response
should be the one that indicates the geometry is unknown.

Surely a problem in grub, not the kernel?

What if the dm device is a linear mapping to an sd device that *does*
provide a different geometry?  Then the 'fake' geometry dm would return
with this patch would be wrong!

I disagree - either dm should work out the *correct* geometry to
return for those mappings where a geometry is known and it's sensible
to return one (e.g. linear mapping to the start of certain scsi
devices), or else it should leave it to userspace to decide how to
handle the situation.  (And there's nothing currently stopping
userspace seeing that a dm device is constructed out of a scsi device
and choosing to use the geometry of that underlying device.)
