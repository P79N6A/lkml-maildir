Then occasionally pages on that DIMM get marked bad and are no longer used.
There have been cases where there only one or two correctable errors
before it degrades to and uncorrectable.  The "right" answer likely will 
depend on the physical memory technology.
Keep in mind the discarded pages can be later be freed.

I'll have to find out more.

Part is generic.  What other parts do you want generic?
I'm not opposed to the idea, but things like parsing the
CPE record is platform specific.

Are you refereing to ia64 MCAs that can surface at any time?  That is
an Intel CPU design issue far outside anything I can control.  CPEs 
are regular interrupts, which is why they can be handled in a sane
manner.

Maybe I do not understand the issue.  Is the issue wasting part of one
page?   Does building CONFIG_IA64_CPE_MIGRATE=y waste memory?
