Please give us some exact specifics about your network setup
so that someone can possibly reproduce your problem locally.
In particular, if there are hubs or switches involved on
your local network that might be getting the duplex wrong,
or some NAT or firewall machines in the path in question,
please specify their setup precisely.
Otherwise there is zero chance of this problem ever being
fixes.
