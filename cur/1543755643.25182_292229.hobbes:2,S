I'm not convinced.  Zeroing a page takes 2000-4000 CPU
cycles, while faulting the page from RAM into cache takes
200-400 CPU cycles per cache line, or 6000-12000 CPU
cycles.
If the page is being used immediately after it is
allocated, it may be faster to prezero the page on
the fly.  On some CPUs these writes bypass the "read
from RAM" stage and allow things to just live in cache
completely.
