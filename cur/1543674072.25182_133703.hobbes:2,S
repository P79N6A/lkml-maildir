Wel, those are excellent results and as it should be.

Same here.
I am talking about the kernel coming with RedHat 9, uname -a gives
Linux lola.goethe.zz 2.4.20-8 #1 Thu Mar 13 17:54:28 EST 2003 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux
Unfortunately, this kernel is here to stay for quite a while, and I
would want to find a way to let Emacs cooperate with it better without
telling people to recompile the kernel or wait a year.

Which kernel?  Oh, and of course: on a SMP machine the problem would
not be visible since then the context switch to Emacs does not stop
the other process from stuffing into the pipe.

Taking notice, but will need some time to apply.  And I really would
want to find a way to avoid triggering this problem.
