5.5 Tb -- are you using the LBD option, or a 64 bit platform?

You're allocating real disk space for delayed allocate file data
down this path, and the read of the allocation group header found
something that didn't look at all like metadata on disk.
So, you definately have corruption and will need to xfs_repair.
Any ideas as to what operations triggered the initial problem?
(is it reproducible for you?)
thanks.
