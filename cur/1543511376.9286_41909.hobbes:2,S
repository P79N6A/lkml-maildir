Hello, i'm working on a project that includes a large amount of image files.
There will be around 15 million files around 100Kb ~= 1.5TB.
I am looking for cheap but _reliable_ ways of achieving this.
I hear that FibreChannel supports up to 128 devices, does anyone know if
that really works?
And if it does what cards are there for Linux, and which is the moste stable
that works for alpha?
Is it possible to soft-raid say 30 50gb drives to get the storage in
question?
Or is there an limit on soft-raided disks?
Will the performance be within reasonable speeds?
Any help, experiance, or ideas/solutions are super-welcome!!!
