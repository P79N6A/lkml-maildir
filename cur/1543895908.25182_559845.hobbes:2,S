You allude to the definition of User Product, not geographies, I
suppose.

Not unusable, except perhaps for the one example about credit card
terminals presented so far.

I'm not sure they find it to be "just a bit".
Point is to keep Free Software Free freedoms, and ROM doesn't make it
non-Free, so this provision is a means to ensure the compliance with
the wishes of users who want their software to not be used in ways
that make it non-Free.
As it so happens, this also places economic pressure on vendors who
tivoize, such that they either face more costly solutions, or enable
users to tinker with the software as well.  And if neither ROM nor
permission are an option for the vendor, well, too bad, the author
gets to decide how his software is to be used, right?

Keeping Free Software Free.
(and, as a consequence that many of you may welcome, keeping
open-source software open source)
