BOGON ALERT!  This is a human presentation, i.e. an I/O, issue.
Personally I consider that once you start digging, littleendian is
actually a superior format, making casting of integer pointers for the
most part a noop, and generally having a multiplier that is dependent
only on position.  For bigendian to make sense, integer pointers
should point to the *end* of an integer (humans want their numbers
right-adjusted too!), not the beginning.
I see bigendianism as a very unfortunate historical accident, probably
caused by the importation of a number system from a region with a
right-to-left script into another region with a left-to-right script
many hundreds of years ago.
