Yes, I think we should know about those other devices, part
of SAS SDS.

Yes, very true.  I can imagine user space apps sending SMP
and what not to expanders/RAID devices/enclosures past
expanders, to control the storage network.
A sysfs representation of the discovery result could make this
easy, since as you pointed out expanders are not SAS devices,
and thus do not fit the linux-scsi HCTL space.
