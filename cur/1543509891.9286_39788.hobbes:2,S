Do you had the rtc device driver compiled into the kernel? The rtc device
driver still writes to the RTC without holding the xtime_lock in write
mode.
Really hwclock using iopl is racy as well as it can't hold the spinlock
since it's in userspace, but as hwclock on most machines only runs at
shutdown the door for the race should be very small (small enough to get
some testcase-information about /dev/rtc interference).
