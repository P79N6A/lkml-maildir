Hi,
I have been in the process of trying to write a new PCI driver. The 
hardware is Memory Mapped IO device similar to the Fusion 878, but not 
that complicated, but simpler
Now that i have been trying to implement the driver using the new PCI 
API, i feel a bit lost at the different changes gone into the PCI API. 
So if someone could give me a brief idea how a minimal PCI probe routine 
should consist of, that would be quite helpful.
Thanks,
Manu
