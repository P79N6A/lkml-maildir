I did this to you.  I changed jfs's default character translation
behavior.  jfs stores the file names in ucs-16.  It had used the
character set defined by CONFIG_NLS_DEFAULT to determine how to
translate to or from ucs-16.  This can be overridden with the iocharset=
mount option.
After many complaints about characters that were being rejected by jfs,
and after getting as much feedback as I was able to obtain, I changed
the default behavior so that no translation is done.  Each byte of the
file name is now stored in the lower byte of the ucs-16 character. 
(This is equivalent to iocharset=iso8859-1, which is the default value
of CONFIG_NLS_DEFAULT.)
Unfortunately, existing files with a non-zero high byte in a character
are no longer accessible.  jfs should have printed a syslog message
recommending that the file system be mounted with iocharset=utf8 to
access the file.

Another alternative would have been to mount the filesystem with "-o
iocharset=<charset>" where <charset> is the value of
CONFIG_NLS_DEFAULT.  To make that behavior permanent, you can add the
iocharset= flag to /etc/fstab.

I'm sorry this caused you problems.  I knew making this change would
cause some confusion, but I think in the long run, jfs is better off
with a more predictable default behavior.
