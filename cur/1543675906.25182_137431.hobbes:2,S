Subject: CRC32=y && 8193TOO=m unresolved symbols

this problem disappears when you have CONFIG_CRC32=y and 
CONFIG_8139TOO=y. It only happens when CRC32=y and 8139TOO=m
Occurs on all 2.5.70 through bk6 (haven't tried later). Also on -mm3
I get unresolved symbols for bitreverse and crc32_le.
I've tried mucking around a bit with EXPORT_SYMBOL and the like, but I 
have to admit, i'm stumped. Help! :)
