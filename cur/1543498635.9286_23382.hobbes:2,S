Is anyone working on ACPI support?  It's an open spec co-developed by
Intel, MS and Toshiba for comunication between OS and hardware about
power management and other stuff.  According to the Web site v2.0 of the
spec is being developed and they are soliciting input...
Thanks,
	Jeff

ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is an open industry
specification
co-developed by Intel, Microsoft, and Toshiba. 
ACPI defines a flexible and extensible interface that allows system
designers to select appropriate cost/feature trade-offs for power
management.
The interface enables and supports reliable power management through
improved hardware and operating system coordination.
The specification enables new power management technology to evolve
independently in operating systems and hardware while ensuring that they
continue to work together.
