I think we should stick to incrementing the major number when binary compatibility is broken.

Psycologically and sub-conciously, this kind of thing _does_ make people stand up and take notice.
For example, SNK made the NeoGeo arcade games print things like:
NEO GEO
MAX 330 MEGA
PRO GEAR SPEC
on start up and in attract mode.
As far as I know, the 330 MEGA means absolutely nothing, and pro gear spec is just an arbitrary name for the addressing system used.
