We might have talked past each other here.  The IRQ7 is okay, because
that's the motherboard's super I/O chip.  The PCI parallel card is
allocated IRQ9, which shares with USB and ACPI.  However, the parport_pc
driver doesn't seem to realize this is a PCI card and can share
interrupts, hence the "irq %d in use, resorting to polled..."  Worse,
even if I find a free IRQ, I still can't use both the PCI card's
parallel ports in interrupt-driven operation; as soon as one parport_pc
is enabled on that IRQ, then the second parport can't use that IRQ
anymore.  Like the board is conflicting with itself....
My question was whether or not IRQ sharing was possible with the basic
parport driver or not.  If not, would something like parport_serial help
me out here?  Though, this is a NetMos card:
00:08.0 Communication controller: NetMos Technology VScom 021H-EP2 2 port parallel adaptor (rev 01)
and I don't think NetMos support has made it into parport_serial yet.
thanks,
