I am sorry, I don't understand. What is the logical error in the first
one?
Actually, your change makes it different from what was originally

Original intention was to type convert base to a 32 bit value and
bitwise& with FLAG. Even though compiler may optimize both the above to
same code, I don't see what is the error.
