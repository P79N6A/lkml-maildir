Hi
 Kernel 2.2.19 downloaded from www.kernel.org sometimes when I boot from lilo
reports after "uncompressing linux ..." and blank line shows "crc error"
and halts. I looked at the sources and found that this means that uncompressed
kernel has bad crc. I tried compile it under debian potato (gcc 2.95) and
redhat 6.1 (egcs 1.1.2) but result was same. Kernel 2.2.18-pre21 too sometimes
halts (compiled on debian) but after "uncompressing linux ...". I think that
it is a bug because kernel 2.2.16 never halts on startup like 2.2.18 or 2.2.19
(it actually never stops on startup).
 My board is tomato 5dhx (intel hx chipset) and cyrix 150+ (revision 2.6).
Graphics is s3 trio64v+, ethercard 3com 509b and soundcard olp3-sax.
 Bios doesn't set processor on startup (sleep on halt instruction, avoid
comma bug and things like these). It is interesting that when I boot from
loadlin this things (with 2.2.18pre21 and 2.2.19) never matter. I looked
at the autoexec.bat I found that I set here cyrix (sleep on halt ...).
