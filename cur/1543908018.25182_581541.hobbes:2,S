I'm getting these in the log:
EDAC k8 MC1: unknown syndrome 0x9391 - possible error reporting race
EDAC MC1: CE - no information available: k8_edac
From looking about, I think that MC1 is memory controller 1 (on 2nd cpu)
and that CE is about error correction in ECC.
But is the error really reporting a DIMM problem or a race condition in
the kernel code handling ECC?
Thanks,
Phil
