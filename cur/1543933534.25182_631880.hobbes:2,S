Distributed storage: Groundhogs strike back: no New Year for humans
I'm pleased to announce the 13'th release of the distributed
storage subsystem (DST).
DST allows to form a storage on top of local and remote nodes
and combine them into linear or mirroring setup, which in
turn can be exported to remote nodes.
Short changelog:
 * mirroring algorithm improvements
 * debug cleanups
 * extended mirroring initialization
 * documentation update
 * name is 'Groundhogs strike back: no New Year for humans' now
Overall list of features of the DST can be found on project's homepage:

DST is also exported as a git tree available for clone and pull from
http://tservice.net.ru/~s0mbre/archive/dst/dst.git
Thank you.
