I can see one scenario where symbol_get would appear to be useful. Say you 
have two modules A and B. Both can run independently of the other. If and 
only if both are loaded at the same time they need to exchange data.
Without symbol_get, you can only have hard dependencies between the modules 
and hence you would be forced into loading both modules even if you only 
want one of them.
I came across this function when trying to solve this exact problem. If the 
function is going to be removed, what is the alternative? Apologies if I've 
missed something obvious...
