No problem.  I will check it tomorrow. I don't think it can be any worse
than it is now.  The patch looks correct in principle.
I believe it should go in to 2.4.6.  But I will test it.
On small machines people don't notice it, but otherwise if you have few
GB of memory it really hurts.  Shutdowns take forever since swapoff takes
forever.
