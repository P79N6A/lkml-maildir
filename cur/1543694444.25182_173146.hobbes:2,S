I'm curently locked in to using this old RedHat 7.3 with
the old 2.4.18 kernel. I need the see what's going on with
skbuffs in the ethernet driver, in this case the broadcom
bcm5700. When running 2.6 I use the tg3 driver and it's
wonderfull. Getting the Broadcom driver to like without
being a module looked more difficult that just using an
older version of the tg3.c driver. I updated the old 0.99
version (Jun 11, 2002) to know about the Serverworks Card:
	{ PCI_VENDOR_ID_ALTIMA, PCI_DEVICE_ID_ALTIMA_AC1001,
          PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, 0UL },
        { PCI_VENDOR_ID_ALTIMA, PCI_DEVICE_ID_ALTIMA_AC1003,
          PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, 0UL },
        { PCI_VENDOR_ID_ALTIMA, PCI_DEVICE_ID_ALTIMA_AC9100,
          PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, 0UL },
        { PCI_VENDOR_ID_SERVERWORKS, PCI_DEVICE_ID_SERVERWORKS_0X14,
							/* Piet */
          PCI_ANY_ID, PCI_ANY_ID, 0, 0, 0UL },
        { 0, }
and the device is matched ok now. Unfortunately when it does
the probe it fails:

What does "fetching invariants of chip" mean?
I thought one of you guys might have a suggestion.
The tg3 driver looks cleaner than the Brodcom addon.
I could also modify the driver so it doesn't have to
be built as a module.
