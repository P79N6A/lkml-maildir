So no, the fixes have not been reverted. Also, John and I have submitted
additional patches for __devexit.
For Debian, the last known version of binutils in sid that didn't cause
these messages was purged a while ago. Look in /var/cache/apt/archives/
if you keep them there, or perhaps someone you know may have it lying
around.
I'll take a look at net/ tonight, but drivers/ should be completely
converted to __devexit as of John's patch
(http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=100848516505140&w=2).
