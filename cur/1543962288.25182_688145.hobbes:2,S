Yes, it is fairly arbitrary.  The motivation was gpg, but in fact when
the patchset started gpg had already changed from 1 page to 8 pages.

We don't want to keep changing at whim of random apps, agreed.  Feels
like a distro issue, since kernel can't even know what apps might run,
and using 8 pages was just a courtesy hint to distros.
