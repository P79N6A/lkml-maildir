I just booted 2.5.1-pre10 on ppc64 and still get the errors:
 Incorrect number of segments after building list
 counted 3, received 2
 req nr_sec 24, cur_nr_sec 8
This seems to be happening because we now allow sg merging through
the BIOVEC_MERGEABLE macro. On ppc64 (and sparc64) we can coalesce two
sg entries if the first one ends on a page boundary and the next one
starts on a page boundary because we have an IO MMU. (I know that you
know this, Im just explaining it for those who dont :)
Should we just remove the warning now?
Anton
