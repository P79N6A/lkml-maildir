How ghastly.
Why did you make the list movement conditional on non-zero `wait'?
It would be equivalent to remove these lines from __mark_inode_dirty():
		/*
		 * If the inode is locked, just update its dirty state. 
		 * The unlocker will place the inode on the appropriate
		 * superblock list, based upon its state.
		 */
		if (inode->i_state & I_LOCK)
			goto out;
but probably not so good, because that could cause other tasks to come
around and wait on this inode while it is under writeout instead of writing
back different inodes.
