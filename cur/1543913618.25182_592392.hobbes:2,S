Sorry for now getting back on this sooner.  Other matters forced it to
the backburner.
I don't have Speedstep enabled on this machine's kernel (as a matter
of fact, the entire cpufreq Kconfig subtree is unchecked). Needless to
say running your bash script doesn't change the values in any way.
I'd say the 4800-something bogomips value is the correct one (for a
2.4GHz CPU -- at least that's what I recall on single-CPU machines,
mostly bogomips being approx. twice the rated CPU speed), and the
10000-something is the one off base.
Btw., the 10000 can be something like 12000-odd after a machine reboot,
and readout on a different CPU.  The rest are all ca. 4810. Odd indeed.
