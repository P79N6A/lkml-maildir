No.  I use it on my two modern laptops with great success,
but only with *certain* hard disks.  When I replace the ultra modern
100GB drive in my machine with a slightly older 30GB drive,
suspend/resume no longer work.  No other changes.
Other users have reported similar experiences to me.
We really REALLY need libata to get fixed for this stuff.
Cheers
