I'm not very fond of your implementation. I like the concept, and it 
works, but there's a much better way, despite requiring some changes to 
the kobject core. 
Ideally, what you'd like to do, instead of adding more conditionals to
normal call chain down to the lowest-level sysfs show()/store() methods,
you'd like to bypass them and define your own methods higher up; e.g. to
replace dev_attr_{show,store} in this case.
But you can't, because in order to define attributes for a device object, 
you must use the device_attribute infrastructure, which means using the 
call chain I've mandated. :)
We could modify the lowest-level methods, but that requires changing every 
attribute definition, and we'll still end up with the macro hell we 
already see to export many attributes that all just a little different. 
So, what I propose is killing struct kobj_type. We can move ->release() 
into struct kset, adding a small amount of overhead to ksets of an 
identical type (trivial). We can move ->sysfs_ops and ->default_attrs into 
say struct attribute_group and allow subsystems to register arbitrary 
groups of attributes of attributes for kobjects. 
This will allow us to keep identical behavior everywhere, with a little 
glue, but will also solve your problem nicely. You will do something like:
struct attribute my_attrs[] = {
	foo,
	bar,
	baz,
	NULL,
};
struct attribute_group my_group {
	.ops	= {
		my_attr_show,
		my_attr_store,
	},
	.attrs	= my_attrs,
};
int my_register()
{
	...
	if ((error = device_register(&mydev.dev)))
		goto Err;
	if ((error = attr_grp_register(&mydev.dev.kobj,&my_group)))
		goto Unregister;
	...
}
my_show() and my_store() will get pointers to the kobjects, which you'll
have to convert into the proper type, and pointer to the attributes, so
you'll be able to tell which attribute is requested from a much higher
level. 
We can still keep device_attribute arround, but in general I don't think
it's that useful to route every attribute request through the core. Using
them is fine, and easy. But attributes travel in herds, and appear when an
object is registered with a subsystem, or some extension of a subsystem.
It's easier to define one set of callbacks + lookup mechanism for 
attribute by name, than it is to macro-ize the hell out of your code, 
provided your dealing with a fair number of attributes per object.
