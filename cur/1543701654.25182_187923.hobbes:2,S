It is something a bit like VMWare. But instead of emulating hardware and 
running an OS inside that, you run a patched Linux kernel that runs as an 
userspace process on the host and provides a virtual machine, which must 
access a virtual disk, which is stored on a file.
See 
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/
 for more info.

I didn't really know what it was, nor it seems useful for this "as is" (I've 
not really checked). Maybe that sentence means that the server program could 
do the partition parsing?
