I consider CML2 an albatross now, and the maintainer does not listen to
feedback.
Contrary to what you think, I'm not trying to kill CML2.  In it's
present state, according to kernel developers other than me, it is NOT
ready for inclusion.  Now, by all appearances, Eric is trying to ram
CML2 down Linus's throat without resolving the problems kernel
developers have with it.
I would be happy as a clam if Eric wanted to resolve the problems -we-
have with CML1 and the config system, not just the problems he has with
it.
