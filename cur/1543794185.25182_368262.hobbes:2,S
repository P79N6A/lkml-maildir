Hey Jeff,
Been reading the patches you've been sending.  Thanks for picking it
up--there's no way I have time to work on it lately.  Glad to hear you
got it working on 50xx.  Some comments:
-in the future, can you separate whitespace only patch mailings with
functional patches?  I know that's something you request of others,
but it helps us too.
-the version # of sata_mv doesn't look like it was bumped.  Did I miss it?
thanks,
BR
