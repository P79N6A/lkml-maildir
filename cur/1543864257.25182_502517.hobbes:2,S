Subject: [PATCH] sysctl selinux: Don't look at table->de
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/28/120

With the sysctl cleanups sysctl is not really a part of proc
it just shows up there, and any path based approach will not
adequately describe the data as sysctl is essentially a
union mount underneath the covers.  As designed this mechanism
is viewer dependent so trying to be path based gets even worse.
However the permissions in sys_sysctl are currently immutable
and going through proc does not change the permission checks
when accessing sysctl.  So we might as well stick with the well
defined sysctl sid, as that is what selinux uses when proc is
not compiled in.
I.e.  I see no hope for salvaging the selinux_proc_get_sid call
in selinux_sysctl so I'm removing it.
