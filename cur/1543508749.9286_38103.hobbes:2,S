  This is more of an FYI than anything as it has probably always been
  broken. At least from reading the SANE list it appears scanning with a
  BusLogic card (BT-930, BT-950, and BT-958) on an SMP machine causes
  random but frequent lockups. One person's machine would crash any time
  he touched a non-Hard Drive device attached to the controller.
  The solution thus far has been to just buy a new SCSI card...  I'm going
  to toy with the driver to see if I can figure out what is going on but
  my device driver coding is extremely limited. Chances are my BT-958 will
  be forsale on ebay shortly :)
Hmmm.  I ran a BT-932 (dual BT-930) in an SMP system with an HP Scanjet 4C for
many months using XVScan and I never had a single lockup.  Are you sure the
scanner in question worked properly with the BusLogic cards?  Scanners have
tended to be particularly problematic as SCSI devices, often using substandard
interfaces and cabling.
