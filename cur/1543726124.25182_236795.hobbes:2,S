The NFS server writes not only in response to page reclaim (as a local 
NFS client), but also in response to pressure from non-local clients. If 
both ext3 and NFS have the same allocation limits, NFS may starve out ext3.
(In my case the NFS server actually writes data asynchronously, so it 
doesn't really know it is responding to page reclaim, but the problem 
occurs even in a synchrounous NFS server.)

If NFS and nbd have the same limit, then NFS may cause nbd to stall. 
We've already established that NFS must be PF_MEMALLOC, so nbd must be 
PF_MEMALLOC_HARDER or something like that.

To free memory you need (a) to allocate memory (b) possibly wait for 
some freeing process to make some progress. That means all processes in 
the freeing chain must be able to allocate at least some memory. If two 
processes in the chain share the same blocking logic, they may deadlock 
on each other.
