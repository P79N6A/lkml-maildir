syscall is pretty much unusable unless the NMI is changed to a task 
gate.  syscall does not change %esp on entry to the kernel, so an NMI 
before the manual stack switch would still use the user stack, which is 
not guaranteed to be valid - oops.  x86-64 gets around this by using an 
interrupt stack, its replacement for task gates.
