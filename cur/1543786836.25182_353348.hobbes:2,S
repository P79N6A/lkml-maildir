Thanks. Also, if you don't want to patch or compile yourself now then you 
could just download and unpack this latest CVS ntfsclone binary (used by us 
to collect NTFS metadata images for investigation):
     
http://linux-ntfs.sf.net/snapshots/ntfsclone-static-1.11.3-WIP2.tgz
and run e.g.
     ntfsclone --metadata --output vista-ntfs.img <partition>
If it gives an error then rerun with the --debug option and the end of the 
output will tell what's the reason for the failure.

Currently this is the expected behavior if you "interrupt" the chkdsk 
procedure. If you schedule chkdsk then you must boot Windows twice, not 
only once. Otherwise you get the below error message
   NTFS error: ntfs_check_logfile(): Did not find any restart pages in
   $LogFile and it was not empty.
which means that the log was used by chkdsk which will be handled by the 
next Windows boot. At present the Linux NTFS code can't cope with this 
scenario so you must boot Windows again and then Linux. If you did so, then 
well, the above command could tell the reason.
BTW, this is not Vista only feature.
