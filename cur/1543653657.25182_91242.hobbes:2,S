That's $topic AFAICS.  Some armchair lawyers are alleging that 
#include'ing GPL'd kernel code into non-GPL'd binary kernel module makes 
that module a derivative work and thus must be GPL'd itself.
Have we decided that #include'ing GPL'd code does, or does not, taint 
otherwise "license-clean" code that includes the GPL'd code?
The only thing I've seen from Linus is him mentioning that this is a 
"grey area".  Given this message:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=103487469728730&w=2
we fall to copyright law, and wonder aloud if an obviously-non-derived 
work #includes GPL'd code, does it become derived?
