as per my understanding, [which i should have keyed in earlier]
different places where SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED currently appears are
1. static spinlock_t foobar = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED;
needs to be replaced bye DEFINE_SPINLOCK
e.g  linux-core/drm_memory_debug.h
-static spinlock_t drm_mem_lock = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED;
+static DEFINE_SPINLOCK(drm_mem_lock);
there are very few occurrences left in the tree i see
2. allocating a data structure dynamically
& initializing the spinlock embedded within
use spin_lock_init()
e.g   linux-core/via_dmablit.c
-               blitq->blit_lock = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED;
+               spin_lock_init(&blitq->blit_lock);
3. static initialization of structure members
struct foo bar ={
.
.
.
.lock = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED,
.
}
use
struct foo bar ={
.
.
.
.lock = __SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED(bar.lock),
.
}
e.g arch/i386/kernel/traps.c
-		.lock =			SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED,
+		.lock =			__SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED(die.lock),
plenty of these are still there
may be some patches queued
4. arrays of spinlocks
e.g arch/cris/arch-v32/kernel/smp.c
-spinlock_t cris_atomic_locks[] = { [0 ... LOCK_COUNT - 1] =
SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED};
+raw_spinlock_t cris_atomic_locks[] = { [0 ... LOCK_COUNT - 1] =
__RAW_SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED};
my question is still there in the original post
about spin_lock_init()
