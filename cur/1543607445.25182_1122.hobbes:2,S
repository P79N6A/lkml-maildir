Now, this might be 2.5 material, but I think the subsystem should be
modularized; I think it has been proven that this part of the code is
definitely subject for discussion, and I would go as far as saying it just
might be possible that the optimal VM, catering to different approaches, plain
out doesn't exist, and that being able to switch VM personalities during
runtime would be useful.
Fortifying the subsystem borders would also make debugging and testing easier.
