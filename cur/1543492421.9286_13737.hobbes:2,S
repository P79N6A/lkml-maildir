Dear Colleagues
My new questions are about kernel stack.
1- Where is the kernel stack ??
Does it in the kernel memory above the addres "0xc0000000"??
2- Which is the size of the kernel stack ??
3- Is there some system call that inform the kernel stack size??
Thank you.
Best regards,
Livia Catarina.
