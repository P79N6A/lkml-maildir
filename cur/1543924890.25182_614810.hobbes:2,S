I applied the above patches to 2.6.24-rc1-git14.  They applied fine with just a few offsets until the last patch, which yielded this result:
patching file include/linux/marker.h
Hunk #5 succeeded at 162 with fuzz 2.
patching file kernel/marker.c
Hunk #14 FAILED at 534.
Hunk #15 FAILED at 587.
Hunk #16 FAILED at 621.
Hunk #17 FAILED at 732.
Hunk #18 FAILED at 769.
Hunk #19 succeeded at 791 (offset 12 lines).
5 out of 19 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file kernel/marker.c.rej
patching file kernel/module.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 1998 (offset -3 lines).
Hunk #2 succeeded at 2608 (offset -37 lines).
Hunk #3 succeeded at 2651 with fuzz 1 (offset -3 lines).
