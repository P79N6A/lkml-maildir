Hi,
I send this mail once before (about 16 hours ago), but it seems it never
reached the list, so I'm resending it. If you recieve it twice I
appologize.
---[ original mail below ]---
Hi,
First of all, please CC me on replies as I'm not subscribed to the list.
I just read a paper by Ofir Arkin and Josh Anderson from @stake 
(
http://www.atstake.com/research/advisories/2003/atstake_etherleak_report.pdf
), 
that documents a bug related to incorrect padding of ethernet frames in
many 
Linux (and other OS) device drivers.
Briefly, the problem is that when a frame is less than the minimum
required 
size, the frame *should* be padded with 0 bytes, but is instead padded
with 
kernel memory. This happens since the drivers don't take care to zero
the 
padding of the buffer before transmitting it.
I won't repeat the paper here as it does quite a good job explaining the
issue.
After reading the paper I took a look at the source for my 2.4.20
kernel, and 
saw that the problem was indeed present in many drivers. I then desided
that 
I might as well fix it as anyone else and started on the task.
So far I've only patched 3 drivers (randomly selected), and I would like
to 
get some feedback on the patches before I do the rest of them. I would
like 
to make sure the fix is correct before spending time implementing a
flawed 
fix in all the affected drivers.
The fix is more or less straight from the paper from @stake, so those
people 
should get all the credit. I'm just doing the legwork of actually fixing
up 
the driver files (patches are against vanilla 2.4.20).
If I get positive feedback on these 3 small patches, then I'll go ahead
and do 
the rest of the drivers tomorrow and submit the new patches.
Here are the patches:
