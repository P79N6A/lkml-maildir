NAK
Having played with this (and fixed up further issues) it simply doesn't
work in the real world. pty/tty pairs are always 8bit, don't support
CREAD and can't pass break signals, emulate multiple flow control types
or parity.
A virtual serial device is still a good idea, but a quick hack on pty
devices doesn't actually work - the problem is far more complicated.
