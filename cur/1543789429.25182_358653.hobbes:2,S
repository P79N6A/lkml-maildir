Ther are nearly 100 mm patches in -mm.  I need to do a round of discussion
with the originators to work out what's suitable for 2.6.15.  For "Hugh
stuff" I'm thinking maybe the first batch
(mm-hugetlb-truncation-fixes.patch to mm-m68k-kill-stram-swap.patch) and
not the second batch.  But we need to think about it.

The mspec driver?  That work should be based on the mm patches in rc4-mm1,
I guess.  Its impact on core mm is small, so we should be able to get it
into 2.6.15.
