Hi
Searching through the archives I have found some reports of problems
with the radeon framebuffer, but done that seems to fully match my
experiences. 
I have an Asus L3800C laptop with a Radeon Mobility 7500 graphics
chip. 
I have made three slightly different 2.6.0-test6 kernels, called
test6-1, test6-2 and test6-3. The only differences are what framebuffer
drivers are included. Test6-1 includes both the vga16 driver and the
radeon driver, test6-2 only includes the radeon driver, and test6-3 only
includes the vga16 driver.
All three kernels boot, and everything seems to run fine. 
With test6-3 I get a fully functional framebuffer running 640x480-59.
With test6-2 I get a framebuffer that looks like it has a sync
problem. Horizontal lines are horizontal, but vertical lines are
displayed as individual dots, for each horizontal line of pixels 8
pixels further right.
With test6-1 I get the ASUS logo (which is displayed during POST) with
vertical green and blue lines running from near the top of the screen
and about 3/4 of the way down. At the top of the screen are some moving
white pixels.

I have attached the configuration file for test6-1, here are the diffs
for the two other kernels.
