No, highlevel_add_host() itself doesn't start any threads. But it does
pass around data that needs to be locked from changes, and one of the
handlers happens to start a thread, and other things allocate memory
(such as this case).
It's ugly, and I've been trying to clean it up. This case can be fixed
quickly with a simple check in hpsb_create_hostinfo() to pass GFP_ATOMIC
to kmalloc.
My problem right now, is I don't use any architectures that support
preempt, so I don't see a lot of these problems, like I catch with
CONFIG_SMP.
