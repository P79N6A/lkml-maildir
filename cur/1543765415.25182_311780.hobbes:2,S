Well, don't be quite so confident.  Yes, the attacks generally require a
significant uncontrollable chunk of data, but it's easy enough to encode
that in (for example) a comment.
And remember, attacks always get better, they never get worse.
Remaining cautious about the strength of your hash functions is a good
idea.
Especially because *nobody* has a real theory of operation behind online
hash functions.  The stories I've heard imply that even NSA doesn't
really "do" hash functions; they prefer HMAC-style keyed verifiers
(though of course, we on the outside can never be sure what's happening
in the puzzle palace.)
Every (practical) hash function in existence today is of the form "Well,
I mixed stuff up real good, and my friends and I tried and couldn't
break it".  And 160 bits still looks *fairly* secure, but so did 64-bit
symmetric key back in '93.

In particular, your defense here is specious.  I agree that second
preimage is an unmanagably large problem for SHA1 for the forseeable
future (say, 8 years out), but collision results almost always result in
partially-controlled attack text.  So I can choose my nefarious content,
and encode the collision entropy in non-operative text (a C comment, for
example).
When your tool breaks, replace it with a new one.  Don't say "well, the
jagged bits haven't hurt me *yet*."
