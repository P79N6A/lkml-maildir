The addition of CONFIG_PREEMPT_SOFTIRQS in this context
came into place in more recent RT patch versions than
with what I'm dealing.  I've just pulled it in but this
doesn't appear to alter the nature of the failure.
I'm still catching an inconsistency at the very head of
rpc_delete_timer() in the case of:
     BUG_ON(!test_bit(RPC_TASK_HAS_TIMER, &task->tk_runstate) &&
         timer_pending(&task->tk_timer));

Yes later versions of the patch do.  The version at hand
40-04 is based on 2.6.11.  We intend to sync-up with a
more recent version of the RT patch pending resolution
of this issue.
I have two potential work-arounds I'm trying to validate.
Though I have a bit more tree-shaking to do before I've
completed this exercise.
