Think about that... 200 lines of code which will have to be maintained 
forever, once it becomes a supported feature, for the benefit of the few 
people who can't or won't replace bad memory.

also saving CPU time (no compile orgies anymore), and thus waste of energy.

Consider one technical and one human behavour issue. While memory with 
"bad spots" was common a decade ago, it's as likely with current memory 
that the memory will "throw a bad bit" once in a while, on a read or 
write anywhere in the marginal or bad chip. Depending on how the memory 
is organized that could be 1/16th of the memory as a block of 32MB on a 
512MB part, or every 16th byte in the whole memory.
As for the human issue, how many more people will use this capability to 
avoid buying memory, run with only part of the bad memory detected and 
blocked out, get unreliable operation, and think that Linux is unreliable.

I personally think that the patch is at best a balance between benefit 
and problems. As a patch I have to use deliberately I think it's a good 
idea. As a permanent and default part of the kernel, I'm not convinced. 
There are some patches I would love to see in mainline, like suspend2 
which includes resume as well as suspend, but this is not one of them, 
hope I've explained why.
As with so many other things in life, "it's not the cost but the upkeep."
