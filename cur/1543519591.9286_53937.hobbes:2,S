  Hi, all. I've just noticed that MD (with raid0) is broken in
2.3.33. I get the following message:
Got md request, not good...
This seems to be because DEVICE_REQUEST() is being called (which is
defined to be do_md_request(). Perhaps the block device request queue
changes	is to blame? I didn't have this problem with 2.3.31.
Anyone got a patch to fix this?
				Regards,
