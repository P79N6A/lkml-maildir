Note that we also have a lot of inefficiency in the way we do deferred
processing.  Think of a setup where you run a XFS filesystem runs over
a megaraid adapter.
 (1) we get a real hardirq, which just clears the interrupt and then
     deferes to a tasklet
 (2) tasklet walks the producer / consumer queue and then calls scsi_done
     for each completeted scsi command which ends up doing
     raise_softirq_irqoff(BLOCK_SOFTIRQ);
 (3) block softirq does the heavy lifting for command completion and finally
     calls back into the bio's completion routine
 (4) xfs wants to avoid irq safe locking and thus deferes the command to a
     kthread
This is rather inefficient due to all the (semi-)context switches already
and not by far the worst setup given that a lot of dm modules can involve
another thread in the process.
Now if just plain convert tasklets to a thread based abstraction this
existing code becomes really dumb because we go from hardirq to process
context to go back to softirq context to go back to process context.
Ouch!
I think we need to put a little more though into how we can optimize our
irq path for the full stack.  Using irqthreads in an intelligent way might
be one option, but we'll need a lot of heavy benchmarking whatever way
we go.
