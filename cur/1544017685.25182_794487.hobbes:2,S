Subject: [PATCH 0/20] return f_fsid for statfs(2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Currently many file systems in Linux kernel do not return f_fsid in statfs info, the value is set as
0 in vfs layer. Anyway, in some conditions, f_fsid from statfs(2) is useful, especially being used
as (f_fsid, ino) pair to uniquely identify a file.
Basic idea of the patches is generating a unique fs ID by huge_encode_dev(sb->s_bdev->bd_dev) during
file system mounting life time (no endian consistent issue). sb is a point of struct super_block of
current mounted file system being accessed by statfs(2).
The patches are quite simple, any feedback or patch review is welcome.
Thanks.
