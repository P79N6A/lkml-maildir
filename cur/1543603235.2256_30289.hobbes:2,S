If you are allocating it on the stack (i.e. as a local variable)
you are probably running out of kernel stack space (depending
what it's an array of).
If you are declaring it non-local, it's possible you are
overwriting the end of it, and, kmalloc() being what it
is, there happens to be some wasted space next to it.
