Subject: two more oddities with the fs/Kconfig file

  there are a few options that are categorized as simply
"bool", with no following label -- examples being UMSDOS,
QUOTACTL, and a couple of others.  without a label on that
line, the option is not displayed for selection anywhere
on the menu.  is this deliberate?
  also, right near the bottom of the file, there are three
options (ZISOFS_FS, FS_MBCACHE and FS_POSIX_ACL), that are
defined after the first submenu, and they don't appear to
show up anywhere on the screen for selection either.  where
are these supposed to be displayed?
