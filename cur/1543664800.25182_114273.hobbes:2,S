It is likely that AS will wait too long for gcc to submit another
read and end up timing out anyway. Hopefully IO history tracking
will fix this up - for some loads the effect can be much worse.

This is likely to be balancing differences from LCPU% it does
seem like AS is doing a bit more "load" work.

small randomish reads vs large writes _is_ where AS really can
perform better than non a non AS scheduler. Unfortunately gcc
doesn't have the _best_ IO pattern for AS ;)

I would like to see if AS helps much with a swap/memory
thrashing load.
