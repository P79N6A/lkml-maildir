A script in Unix is just another random way to write a program that does
what I want. Nothing special there. Note that today's scripts are (almost)
undistinguishable from binary, compiled programs: They may carry the same
permissions (execute permissions for whom, even S[UG]ID bits (not on all
Unices, but several honor them)). If some scheme can't do the same (at least
in principle) for capabilities, it is fundamentally flawed. No "all
capable" interpreter should be needed, as this is a _huge_ security risk,
the kernel might as well endow this particular process with the requested
capabilities, and nothing else.
