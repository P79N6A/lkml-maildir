No, the PPC based Motorola MVME boards use the (currently not supported by
linux) AIX partition tables, as do also the motorola powerstack machines.
The m88k based Motorola MVME boards use the sysV68 partition tables, but
m88k is not yet supported by linux.
Incidentally, what is the problem you have with SYSV68_PARTITION ?
On my i586 machine, code size is 434 bytes for sysv68.o + 4 bytes more in
check.c
