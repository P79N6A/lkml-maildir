 s/"that file"/"openldap" and substitute "every app writer"
 for "every major free software developer we respect greatly which
 can store its data and/or configuration details in an LDAP database"
 and your evident distaste for "that file" looks a little like religious
 zealotry.
 i say that with the greatest respect.
 especially when "that file" is actually a database, just like
 Berkeley DB (and we all know and _love_ Berkeley DB).
 and especially in light it being possible to do a "decent" job, and
 make "that file" available via a POSIX filesystem interface.

 yes.  i would say it's more to do with the dumb-ass nature of the app
 writers, yes.  typicall dumb-ass windows app writers give a shit about
 security and care greatly about making money hand-over-fist.
 whereas on linux it's far less likely for an app writer to
 be able to get away with a) making money b) friggin up security.  the
 distros wouldn't allow an app writer to get away with either.
