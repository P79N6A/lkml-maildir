Hello,
Just wanted to mention that the driver by Robert Gerlach also works[1] 
with a Fujitsu P1610 convertible, after a trivial modification:
static struct keymap_entry keymap_t1610[] = {
     { 0x0010, KEY_SCROLLDOWN },
     { 0x0020, KEY_SCROLLUP },
     { 0x0040, KEY_DIRECTION },
     { 0x0080, KEY_FN },
     { 0x8000, KEY_MENU },
     { 0x0400, KEY_KBDILLUMTOGGLE },
     { 0x0000, 0},
};
[1] evtest reports all events correctly and I can access them from user 
space, however, acpi_listen seems to be not getting those... Perhaps 
something trivial?
Regards,
Evgeny
