X loses the keyboard after switching to a TTY in 2.5.58-dj1-bk and then 
back to X. This is 100% reproducible. Is this a known bug?
Also, I get a lot of MTRR 1 and MTRR 2 not used notices after I quit X. 
But the performance seems the same either way (X performance compared 
between 2.4 and 2.5 kernels,) so is this a false positive?
Hope to hear from you all soon...
Regards
Josh
