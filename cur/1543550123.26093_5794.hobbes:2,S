Well, I *like* using // for one line comments, and I *hate* having my
code obfuscated with extra declaration lines just because I can't
declare something in the middle of a block.  There is no reason whatever
to hang on to such stupid limitations in C in the mistaken belief that
it somehow keeps it more pure.  On the other hand, I hate bloat even
more than I hate those other two things.  On the third hand, the first
feature is already in every known C compiler (but you will be pecked to
death by a flock of penguins if you use it) and the second feature
actually represents a simplification of the compiler code, which in case
anyone doesn't know uses the same code generator and most of the same
parser whether you write in C or C++ - so I don't know where all those
arguments about relative efficiency of generated code are coming from.
The way to get C++ into the kernel is to get some of the less invasive
features of C++ into C.  This process started a long time ago and will
never stop.  Gosh, even if you are a C++ hater you are probably already
using a bagfull of C++ features.
