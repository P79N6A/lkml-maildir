The original complaint was that we don't keep repeat rate after
suspend/resume cycle. I think pulling the cord and then plugging it
back in is completely different scenario, but even then it will also
work because we do not destroy keyboard device when cord is pulled
(there is no notification that device is gone). So input_dev is still
there and we can use dev->rep[] to restore the former settings.
