For what it's worth -- I as a user am violently opposed to kinit not 
being in the source tree, if _anything_ is merged.
Given that's it's intended to take over kernel functionality, kinit 
would be a tightly coupled piece of software and a number of problems 
2.6 has seen are with tightly coupled software (udev, alsa-lib) getting 
out of sync with the kernel. I believe someone from redhat complained 
about it last. Adding another tightly coupled external app to the mix is 
just going to worsen the situation. Please don't do that.
And yes, then there's the issue of keeping distributions all using the 
same thing which I saw someone else remark on as well. If klibc/kinit is 
the way forward, please make sure kinit is in the kernel source tree.
Rene.
