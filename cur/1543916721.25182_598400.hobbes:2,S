Well, it's a BUG_ON.  It's supposed to be for something that "can't happen".
That's why it's a sanity check, not a wild assertion. ;-)
The 2/2 patch is an example of a bug that CHECK_FULL_REGS catches.
In the status quo, using PTRACE_PEEKUSR in a bug case crashes while using
PTRACE_GETREGS in the same place might get bogus data.  (In the actual bug
thus found, the data is not bogus and only the bit that FULL_REGS checks is.)
Thanks,
Roland
