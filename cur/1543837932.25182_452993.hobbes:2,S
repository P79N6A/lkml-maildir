While building a newer kernel for a server (which had been running
2.6.12 or so), I spent some time looking for how to set the VMSPLIT
.config options. I searched in menuconfig for VMSPLIT and was given a
few responses, all similar to this:
  â Symbol: VMSPLIT_3G [=n]
  â Prompt: 3G/1G user/kernel split
  â   Defined at arch/i386/Kconfig:488
  â   Depends on: <choice>             
Since depending on "<choice>" is less than helpful, I did an rgrep and
found what it actually depends on:
  depends on EXPERIMENTAL && !X86_PAE
  prompt "Memory split" if EMBEDDED
  default VMSPLIT_3G
and was able to determine that I needed the patch recently submitted by
Dave Hansen to enable VMSPLIT for highmem kernels. Is there a reason
that menuconfig is not able to tell me this, i.e. this is a known
limitation of the choice syntax?
Thanks,
Nish
