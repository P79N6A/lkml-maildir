Of course, if you set a rediculous latency figure you'll
get rediculously bad performance. However, that doesn't
say /anything/ about if the idea is a good one or not...
Along the same lines, I could redicule the current setup
by running one of the following lines and then pointing
out how bad performance would be.
# elvtune -r 10000000 -w 10000000 /dev/hda
# elvtune -r 1 -w 1 /dev/hda

We can already set different figures for different drives.
Would it really be more than 30 minutes of work to put in
a different request # limit for each drive that automatically
satisfies the latency specified by the user?
