Yes, this case probably doesn't get enough testing with my current
setup, so it is quite hard (for me) to prove removing lockmap is
no-no. Problem is that I don't understand shm swapping very well, it
is piggybacked on "regular" MM as a special case, and I didn't had
time to go through it, yet.

Yes, I believe you on this one.

I'll still be testing it, nevertheless. Maybe after some time I get in 
some trouble, and then at least I'll know what to do. :-)
