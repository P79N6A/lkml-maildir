Greg KH just pointed out that someone else snuck in an overflow check. 
  However, they take completely different approaches.  The Ben LaHaise 
one that I posted uses GCC features to check the stack on entry to all 
functions.  The one in the tree now is much, much simpler than Ben's, 
but only works only for detecting problems at the time that an 
interrupt actually occurs.
