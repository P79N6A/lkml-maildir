The PNP code is reporting what's in the tables - I'd be a bit surprised 
if it special-cased specific devices, but I guess there's an argument 
for that. All the other machines I've checked report an IRQ, so I guess 
Apple just didn't take much care in getting this right.
As far as sanity checking goes - how about we check that the reported 
io ports are the legacy range, and if so hardcode the irq if the 
hardware hasn't reported one? I'd /hope/ that nobody has produced any 
hardware that that would break, but then, well. The strongest argument 
for it being safe is probably that the legacy RTC driver seems to 
hardcode this and hasn't obviously been breaking things.
