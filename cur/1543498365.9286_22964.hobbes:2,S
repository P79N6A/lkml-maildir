Hi, Alan!
Quoting you from May31:
# If you try and swap over NBD your machine will deadlock. NBD works
# because it does some clever trickery, but thats not enough to work
# when swapping 
Well - that is hopefully not true. With heavy patches to network layer
(
http://atrey/~pavel/nbd/nbd.html
), which create GFP_NUCLEONIC
allocation level, everything should be safe. NBD is not the problem,
network layer is -- I had to modify it so that for one single socket
it takes memory from pool-reserved-for-swapping.
