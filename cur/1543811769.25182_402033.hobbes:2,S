I'm a bit confused.  Why exactly is this unacceptable, and what exactly 
do you propose instead?  Having an entirely separate mount point that is 
sort of parallel to the main one, but with extra metadata exposed?  So 
instead of /path/to/foo/.gfs2_admin/metafile you'd prefer having a 
separate mount point like /proc/fs/gfs/path/to/foo/metafile?
