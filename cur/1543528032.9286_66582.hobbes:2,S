Sorry to report that I just got the "spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7"
error again with 2.3.49-1 (I applied your patch so I could compile it).
Here's my interrupts info:
	           CPU0       
	  0:    3523333          XT-PIC  timer
	  1:       5398          XT-PIC  keyboard
	  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
	  3:     317159          XT-PIC  serial
	  9:          0          XT-PIC  acpi
	 11:          0          XT-PIC  Texas Instruments PCI1131, 
				Texas 	Instruments PCI1131 (#2)
	 12:      12203          XT-PIC  PS/2 Mouse
	 13:          1          XT-PIC  fpu
	 14:      91751          XT-PIC  ide0

	NMI:          0 
	ERR:          1
Here's what cardctl gives for PCMCIA interrupts:
	Socket 0:
	  Vcc 5.0V  Vpp1 0.0V  Vpp2 0.0V
	  interface type is "memory and I/O"
	  irq 3 [exclusive] [level]
	  Speaker output is enabled
	  function 0:
	    config base 0xff80
	      option 0x4f status 0x08 pin 0x00
	    io 0x13f8-0x13ff [8bit]
	Socket 1:
	  Vcc 3.3V  Vpp1 3.3V  Vpp2 3.3V
	  interface type is "cardbus"
	  irq 11 [exclusive] [level]
	  function 0:
"dmesg | grep -i IRQ" gives the following:
	parport0: irq 7 detected
	PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
	ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
	ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
	PCI: Assigned IRQ 11 to device 00:04.0 [PIIX-NEW]
	Yenta IRQ list 0498, PCI irq11
	PCI: Assigned IRQ 11 to device 00:04.1 [PIIX-NEW]
	Yenta IRQ list 0498, PCI irq11
	Serial driver version 4.92 (2000-1-27) with MANY_PORTS 
		SHARE_IRQ SERIAL_PCI enabled

NOTE:  I have a sound card which I have had trouble getting the
drivers to load at boot time for.  So, I sometimes load them by
hand when I need them.  My interrupt info changes a bit if I load
those drivers.  
Here's how the interrupt info looks after loading the sound drivers:
           CPU0       
  0:    3540843          XT-PIC  timer
  1:       5833          XT-PIC  keyboard
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  3:     317432          XT-PIC  serial
  5:          1          XT-PIC  Crystal audio controller
  7:          6          XT-PIC  MPU-401 UART
  9:          0          XT-PIC  acpi
 11:          0          XT-PIC  Texas Instruments PCI1131, 
				Texas Instruments PCI1131 (#2)
 12:      13178          XT-PIC  PS/2 Mouse
 13:          1          XT-PIC  fpu
 14:      91942          XT-PIC  ide0
 15:          0          XT-PIC  ide1
NMI:          0 
ERR:          1
