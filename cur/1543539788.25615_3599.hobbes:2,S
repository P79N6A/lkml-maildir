But for some `gas` capriciousness, this would work:
struct thing
{
	int a;
	int b;
	int stuff;
};
#define OFFSETOF(strct, elem) ((long)&(((struct strct *)0)->elem))
dummy()
{
	asm(".equ STUFF_OFFSET,%0"::"i" (OFFSETOF(thing, stuff)));
}
asm("movl STUFF_OFFSET(%eax),%ecx");
main()
{}
It emits, effectively:
	.equ	STUFF_OFFSET,$8
	movl	STUFF_OFFSET(%eax),%ecx
Which is, I believe, exactly what you want.
The problem is that gas thinks that `$8' in a pseudo-op is a
label, whereas `$8' in a machine insn is a constant!
I hesitate to say "stupid gas" because when you do that
you are then told that there's a good reason for the behaviour.
But I'll risk it: Stupid gas.
Perhaps you can trick gcc into not emitting the `$'.
Perhaps you can trick gas into accepting the `$'.
Perhaps you can complain to your assembler vendor.
Perhaps you can run `sed' across the .s file prior to assembly:
Change ".equ STUFF_OFFSET,%0" to ".equ STUFF_OFFSET,DELETE_ME%0"
and then use `sed' to remove all occurrences of `DELETE_ME$'.
