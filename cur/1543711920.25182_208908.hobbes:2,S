I'm not so sure, at least in my case. Sure, badblocks /dev/hda1 reports an
access beyond end, but neither badblocks /dev/hda1 $SIZEOF_HDA1 nor SMART
do. Anyway, the alleged bad blocks are at the end of a 400 MB partition, so
unless swsusp allocated swap randomly, there's hardly any chance I could
hit them with 256 MB RAM and LZF on. But then, this failure was a single
event in my case, while others reported some regularity.
