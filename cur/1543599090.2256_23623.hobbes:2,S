I hope this is the correct forum for this.  I am trying to build a 2.4.4 
kernel (don't ask, EMC requires it) for a Dell 6450 with a megaraid 
controller.  I have tried it both building the megaraid and aic7xxx 
drivers as modules and non-modular.
In either case, the machine boots, it finds the disks, and then somehow 
the root filesystem is never remounted read-write and so all the system 
services fail to start up.
Anyone seen anything like this?
Dell 6450, RedHat 7.2 (with lots of updates), 2.4.4 source from 
ftp.us.kernel.org.
