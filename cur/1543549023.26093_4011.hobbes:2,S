The call to sd_init is in lines 1577ff of scsi.c :
        for (sdtpnt = scsi_devicelist; sdtpnt; sdtpnt = sdtpnt->next)
                if (sdtpnt->init && sdtpnt->dev_noticed)
                        (*sdtpnt->init) ();
Just commenting this out is curing the biggest problem (at least for me),
as now the scsi discs show up only once in /proc/partitions. But there is
still a duplicated "Detected scsi disk" message, so not everything is fine.
Further investigation shows that this duplication is caused by  the call
to scan_scsis in line 1565 of scsi.c, and this one can not be commented out
as it is needed. 
But I have some problems understanding all the module/non-module stuff:
hosts.c, lines 1002-1004, look as follows:
#ifdef CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SD
    scsi_register_device(&sd_template);
#endif
If I understand that correctly, the line is executed for both 
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SD=m and CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SD=y, isn't it? But if sd is compiled
as a module, sd_template should not be available, as it's defined inside sd.c.

As I said above, this if(!module) is probably the #ifndef MODULE section in
scsi.c.

We probably should, but this would mean changes to scsi.c, hosts.c,
and perhaps scsi_module.c, which is included in every low level scsi driver.
This may not be a change we want to do in 2.3, the additional #ifdef MODULE
in sd.c and sr.c is a much smaller change.
