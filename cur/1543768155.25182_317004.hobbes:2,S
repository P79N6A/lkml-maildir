Here are some more fixes intended for 2.6.12 (and well tested). Can you merge 
them soon, Andrew? Thanks.
The first is a particularly bad one since it shows up when you *start* 
compiling UML (due to a quilt patch -> normal patch conversion problem, a 
file wasn't actually deleted, but it was when applied through quilt). Was 
this too quick a merge, maybe? What's your "merging policy" (if any) for 
patches?
Also, I had marked some of the patches I sent as needing some staging time in 
-mm (especially "uml: redo console locking"), while I had marked other ones 
as needing immediate merge. Jeff instead has sent some "cleanup / groundwork 
for future work" (which anyway were mostly trivial) together with some urgent 
fixes.
Actually they aren't a problem (especially because UML has almost no support 
for SMP) however this policy risks breaking things.
We had the exactly opposite problem for 2.6.10 release - some important fixes 
which were sent by Jeff just before 2.6.10 release to be merged in it (but 
which weren't explicitly marked as such) were merged in 2.6.10-mm1.
