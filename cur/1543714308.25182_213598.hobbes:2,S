Finally got a chance to go through my work queue and yikes! This is
seriously stale! As neither George or I have come to bat with a patch,
I'll attempt a swing. 
Albert/David: Would you mind testing the following to see if it resolves

George: Mind skimming this to make sure its close enough to what you
