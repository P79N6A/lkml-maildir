this is a joke right? If you really think this you have no idea what ABI
stability means and how extremely hard it is to even sort of remotely
approach it.
Trust me. It's *extremely* hard to impossible. Several security fixes
can only be fixed this way. And it's REALLY fragile even if for other
fixes. And I am very glad that the linux kernel people in general decide
to not go for abi stability, the hacks that would be needed would be so
obscene and the gains very very minimal. (it's open source, you have the
source after all!)
