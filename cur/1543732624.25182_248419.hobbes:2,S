  Yes why not? If there was any filesystem drivers for the AudioCD
  format then it could.
  I had such a driver for Windows 9x which would display several
  folders and files for inserted AudioCD's:
  D: (cdrom)
    Stereo
      22050
        Track01.wav
        Track02.wav
        ...
      44100
        Track01.wav
        ...
    Mono
      22050
        Track01.wav
        ...
      44100
        Track01.wav
        ...
  Normal AudioCD players would also work even though this driver was
  installed. These files were also visible for legacy applications in
  the command prompt (inside Windows).
  I do not see why this would not be possible in Linux. Of course, it
  would perhaps require a filesystem driver/module to be present when
  you mount.
  If you just want to do a cd file.iso then it may be a totally
  different thing. Either you would have a automount feature or a
  filesystem/vfs plugin that could load secondary modules to support
  this kind of thing.
