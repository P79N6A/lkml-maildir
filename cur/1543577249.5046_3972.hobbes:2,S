It could actually be optimized a lot, e.g. by just read/writing to a byte
in the caller's current code page and handling the exception. 
But I agree with you that it's rather useless. It'll break some existing 
exploits, but it's so easy to workaround that exploit writers would quickly
adapt and then you have a ugly check with no purpose after a few weeks.
