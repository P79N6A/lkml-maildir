sure, i'm willing to help, but i don't think doing *nothing* about it
is an option.  you may not like gabriel's proposed patch, but you have
to admit that he has a valid objection that should be addressed.  so
you can address it the manual and brute force way, or you can invest a
little more time and do it right.
but, either way, i think you have to deal with it.  now it's just time
to make a choice.
