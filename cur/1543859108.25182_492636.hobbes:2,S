OK, it seems that the mirroring system on kernel.org is under load,
because the files have not been mirrored yet after about 15 hours.
Even the .bz2/.sign have not been produced.
As a TEMPORARY workaround for the (very few but brave) testers, I've
put the kernels here (both 2.4.34-rc3 and 2.4.33.6) :
      
http://linux.exosec.net/kernel/2.4/
It has a small pipe, but I don't expect to see many downloads anyway.
There are NO signatures on those files, so believe what you want after
the test results.
Cheers,
Willy
