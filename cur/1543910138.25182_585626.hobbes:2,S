In order to reduce the impact on whatever function this is in (use diff
-p please), you can always have a definition of account_guest_time:
#else
static cputime_t account_guest_time(struct task_struct *p, cputime_t cputime)
{
        return cputime;
}
#endif
This way the #ifdef/#endif is not necessary when calling it.

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
