That sound slike a perfectly ok thing to do - apart from the hw latching
which might confuse the kernel.
When enabling the local APIC, Linux doesn't actually disable legacy PIT
interrupts, so again I don't really see what the apparent connection
between the hang and the APIC is. So I'd still suspect it's more
timing-related than anything else.
