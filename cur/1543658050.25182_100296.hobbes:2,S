Whatever the kernel is let me send a hearty me to on this one.  I have
been doing something similar without problems.
I have heard reports that there are some drive/controller combinations
that polling the BSY bit does not work on to get them past the initial
drive spin up state.  However waiting for BSY to clear is no worse
than anything else on those setups, and this works for quite a few.
