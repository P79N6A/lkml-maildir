    FUJITA> Any reason the existing SRP definitions
    FUJITA> (drivers/scsi/ibmvscsi/srp.h) doesn't work for you?
Wow ... I never realized that ibmvscsi was an SRP initiator as well.
Anyway, looking at drivers/scsi/ibmvscsi/srp.h, the main problem I see
is that the file has a bunch of bitfields that are big-endian only
(which makes sense because the driver can only be compiled for pSeries
or iSeries anyway).
But I have no objection to moving the file to include/scsi/srp.h,
adding a bunch of
    #if defined(__LITTLE_ENDIAN_BITFIELD)
    #elif defined(__BIG_ENDIAN_BITFIELD)
    #endif
and adding a few missing defines, and then converting ib_srp to use
the same file.
Does that seem like the right thing to do?
Thanks,
  Roland
