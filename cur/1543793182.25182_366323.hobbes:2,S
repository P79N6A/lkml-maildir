Never mind, Alan is probably right.  If disabling PCIRetry does not work
you can also try Option "NoAccel" (not a viable way to run, just to
confirm the problem).
WRT singing capacitors, it does seem to be an increasing problem:

The difference is that singing capacitors will cause noise in the audio,
while PCI stalls of the type Alan described will cause
dropouts/stuttering.
