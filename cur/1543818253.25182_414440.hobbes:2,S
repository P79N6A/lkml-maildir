I don't think you confused me on this issue (although, I admit I'm prone
to confusion). 
The is_continuous flag on the clocksource is used so other systems can
query if timekeeping is able to function without regular timer ticks.
This would be necessary for the HRT patchset, as well as the dynamic
tick patches, as they both reprograms the tick frequency, and need to
know if that will affect time.
I can reasonably drop this bit from the current patches, but it is very
small and and will be needed shortly, so I'm not sure its that big of a
deal.
thanks
