Thanks Ulrich for this v5 series. I have two more questions.
1) Can the fd passing with recvmsg() on AF_UNIX also gets O_CLOEXEC support ?
    (In my understanding, only accept(), socket(), socketcall(), socketpair()) 
are handled, so it might work on i386 (because recvmsg() is multiplexed under 
socketcall), but not on x86_64.
2) Why this O_NONBLOCK ability is needed for sockets ? Is it a security issue, 
and if yes could you remind it to me ?
Thanks
