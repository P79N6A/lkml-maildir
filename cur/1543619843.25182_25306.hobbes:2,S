I recently upgraded my kernel from 2.4.10-pre6 to 2.4.18-pre2.  After
doing so, X acted extremely weird; whenever just about anything
happened, lines would appear across the screen, almost like static.
After playing around with a few config options that I'd changed, with no
results, I noticed the message about the VIA northbridge bug in dmesg.
I commented out the line listing this chipset in pci-pc.c, recompiled,
and sure enough that fixed the problem!
This board is based on the KT33 chipset.  If anyone would like more
information, email me.
