I can explain this, but I'll need a bit more convincing about your whitehated-ness.
I've been dabbling for a while with custom-kitting a honeypot machine with a kit 
which sits under suckit2 and event-logs it, to see what da kidz get up to on 
sukit'ed machines. Just curiosity, really, having come up against suckit a fair 
few times.
