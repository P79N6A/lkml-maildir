Well, I'll certainly clean up the debugging code. I know that much of it
isn't needed any more. I'll try not to remove comments though :> (I know
it's not simple and straightforward to understand how it works, so I
want to comment it as well as I can. As I said the other day, I don't
intend to disappear into the wild blue yonder, but I don't know what the
future will bring).

No offense taken. I just wanted to make it clear we're not comparing
apples with apples here.
