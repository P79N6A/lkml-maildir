I just had a moderately-loaded mail server / firewall crash running
2.2.15pre14 as well.  Unfortunately I was out of the office at the time
and the watchdog caught it, so by the time I was able to check on it
all that was left was this in syslog:
Mar 16 15:53:38 csl3 kernel: Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer
dereference at virtual address 00000004
Mar 16 15:53:38 csl3 kernel: current->tss.cr3 = 031d1000, %cr3 =
031d1000
Mar 16 15:53:38 csl3 kernel: *pde = 00000000
This is one of eight boxes I have running 2.2.15pre14; they're all
generally similar in hardware configuration except for one that's a
notebook, and they've all been running without visible problems for the
past six days except for this one crash.
