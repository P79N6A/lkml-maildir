I think this is still far too complicated. Or at least I would
not accept a similar patch for x86-64 :) The infrastructure
seems also needlessly complicated to me, because I dont know
what it should be used for except for this.
Is it really that hard to just cause a signal in the 
iret exception handler in entry.S?  You can get the trapno
there anyways from orig_rax (at least on x86-64)
And having all that complicated code just to get the trapno
seems quite pointless to me. Especially since nobody
uses it it will be likely bitrotten more often than working
anyways, so it is not very useful. The error code is 
in the stack frame anyways and you can get it from there.
And the trapno can just be faked to something.
