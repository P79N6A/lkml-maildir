Hi Petr,
I might have a clue: the PC I'm working on has a
Mystique, and I've noticed a strange behaviour at
boot (don't know if this is recproducible yet).
During the boot sequence, I pressed shift-pgdn
and the screen suddenly covered of hyeroglyphs,
which looked like a dump from an unitialized buffer.
I must precise that all these hyeroglyphs where text
chars with random attributes so it comes from a
text buffer, not a graphic one.
Perhaps it is related to the same problem as Mike's.
Willy
