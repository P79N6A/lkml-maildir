Yes it does. That's exactly what I also did to make it build, but I
didn't send in a patch as I wasn't sure that 4 (sizeof(u32)) is the
right factor for a 64-bit arch.

My intuition agrees with yours. However, as also stated in #329355 by
fs, "the amd64 port does not support 2.4 kernels, and there are no plans
to change this", so I guess this is not-a-bug for debian/x86_64.
