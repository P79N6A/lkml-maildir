Can you try to reproduce this from the console? I've seen this behavior
on previous versions of the kernel, and also the related kernel panic on
the console. It would be interesting if you could gather the OOPS
message and attach it in a message.
I would also suggest trying the following patch if you can:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.5/2.5.71/2.5.71-mm1/broken-out/rpc-depopulate-fix.patch
Or else, the latest 2.5.71-bk snapshot to see if it's fixed. At least,
I've been unable to reproduce previous NFS crashes on 2.5.71-mm1.
