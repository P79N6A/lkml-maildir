Christoph et al.,
I've incorporated all your comments except the two shown above.  I 
killed the indicated atl1_write*/atl1_read* wrappers, but I'm not yet 
familiar enough with pci_iomap/iowrite*/ioread* to make that particular 
conversion, and I'm having trouble getting the bitfield struct converted 
to shift/mask semantics (No matter how hard I try, I keep breaking the 
transmit side of the adapter).
I'd like to plead for relief on these two items and submit a new version 
of the driver containing all your other comments.  I need help from a 
more experienced netdev hacker, and in my mind, the best way to do that 
is to get the driver in the kernel so more people can use it and 
contribute changes and make improvements.
I welcome any comments on the rationality of this approach.
Jay
