How kinit is involved in loading drivers, and how it will know
that it should wait for certain things after doing something?
Nowadays, udev+modprobe are responsible for loading drivers, not kinit.
If you suggesting kinit should do that, well.. it becomes bigger at
least.
And oh, determining which modules to include into initramfs...
it's definitely NOT part of kernel BUILD process, but, so to say,
kernel package install process (note I for one often build initramfses
for OTHER machines - something most mkinitrd solutions are unable to
do - by specifying eg alternative root filesystem, or different set
of modules etc).

The main reason why the situation is so unsatisfactory (yes it definitely
is), IMHO, is that it's at least difficult to discover which stuff should
be included into early userspace (initramfs).  For example, having a list
of drivers and their modaliases, I'd like to be able to get a list of
modules in *new* kernel for those devices (based on whatever currently
running kernel sees in PCI etc).  Another examples include stuff like
already mentioned softraid, lvm and iSCSI - that things should be provided
by upstream packages (mdadm, lvmtools etc), as hooks to initramfs creation
(as, for example, Debian and Ubunto currently tries to do, for their
home-grown initramfs-tools package).
I can give another example.  Somewhere between 2.6.11 and 2.6.14,
softraid module has been renamed from md.ko to md-mod.ko.  So my
home-grown (yes, yet another :) mkinitramfs broke.  So now it
contains something like
  if included "md-mod|md" CONFIG_RAID then
     ...
and later,
  modprobe md-mod || modprobe md
for root-on-md-device.  But the same should be done in mdadm
initscript as well so.. kinit does not help here again.
Ditto for various ide-mod, ide-generic/generic renames
(including distro-specific mods), and especially for - seems
to be upcoming - ide=>pata conversion (which has quite alot
of other side effects, since all sdXX devices will move and
hdXX will gone).
But that's all beyong the point really.  I mean, there's really nothing
which requires kinit to be in kernel.  The argument above - about waiting
for mptfusion to settle - is moot just because kinit does not (currently
anyway) provide that functionality.
(And oh... I really dislike udev being in initramfs... just like the whole
udev stuff in the first place... but that's entirely different topic ;)
