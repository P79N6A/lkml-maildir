Hi all,i want to retrieve the partition table of a primary extended
partition.
My MBR partition table ,says that the LBA Partition Start sector for the
extended partition is 10281600.It is the same that i find with my C code
and through fdisk usage.
How can i use this value to seek(lseek) to this point through the main
block file (/dev/hda or /dev/hdb) and read the partition table of the
logical partition?
Thanks in advance.
