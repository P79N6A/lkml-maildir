It's not that easy - Linux has always supported the operation of being
able to remove a module while it is attached to devices. The reference
count only goes up if a device is opened. 
This means the module refcount must remain at 0, even after it's bound to 
devices. Changing this would require a change in visible behavior, and 
require an extra step by a user to disconnect the driver before they 
unload the module.
