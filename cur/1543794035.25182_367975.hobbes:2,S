That'll work too. Here's the updated patch.
When attempting to hotadd a PCI card with a bridge on it, I saw
the kernel reporting resource collision errors even when there were
really no collisions. The problem is that the code doesn't skip
over "invalid" resources with their resource type flag not set.
Others have reported similar problems at boot time and for
non-bridge PCI card hotplug too, where the code flags a
resource collision for disabled ROMs. This patch fixes both
problems.
