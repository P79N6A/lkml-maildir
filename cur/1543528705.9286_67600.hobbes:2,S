Then you've either don't got enough memory _or_ something
else will be selected for OOM killing ...
I agree that it may pick a wrong process sometimes, but
that's ok because out of memory shouldn't happen too
often and the choice is usually "close enough".
When chosing between netscape and an out-of-control cgi
script, my code will most probably pick the cgi script
because it has been running for a shorter time.
Read mm/oom_kill.c in 2.2.15pre12 for more details...

Rik
