Hmm, if it should not be distinguished, it is better to rename AC to
something that means continuous power.  But I'd rather have it AC and DC, as
something might have both supplies separate, and you might want to
differentiate them for some (human interface) reason.  After all, USB and DC
are not really different anyway...
Anyway, what IS the difference between UPS and battery, or UPS and AC/DC for
that matter?  When should UPS be used?  If you have UPS there, should not
MGG (motor-generator group) also be provided?
Given that USB-power *is* usually also "dumb" (i.e. it doesn't do any
control signaling over the USB bus for power-control purposes), IMHO it
might be better to have just battery, AC and DC as types.  And a primary and
secondary notion too, as that is common.  It would be generic.
Or maybe I just didn't get the idea behind the "type" attribute :-)
I'd appreciate if these were documented in the text file.
