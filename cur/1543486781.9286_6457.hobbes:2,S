Subject: Using 2.2.x modules with 2.0.x?

Forgive me if this is a completely retarded thought, however...
I'm wondering if it is at all possible to individually compile
any modules at all from 2.2.x and insmod them into a running
2.0.36 kernel?
I'm wanting to use the fm tuner drivers just to fiddle around a
bit, and I was too lazy to go try and find 2.0 patches.  ;o)
So the question entered my mind.  I know that many things have
changed from 2.0 to 2.2, but I'm assuming that it is possible
that some modules may survive, and possibly run on older kernels
depending on one's fiddling abilities.  Is there too much sugar
in my tea?
;o)
