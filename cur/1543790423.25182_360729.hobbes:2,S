Hmmm. Do you have a screen card? Trick question. It takes address-
space. How about stuff on the PCI bus? That takes address-space
also. If you look at the boot log, you will probably find that
there is a lot of "reserved" address-space. Since RAM needs
to "share" such address-space, any RAM behind the reserved addresses
will not be accessed.
