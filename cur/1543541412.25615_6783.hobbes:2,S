Al,
We need a VFS method call to alias NTFS style attributes (which are
really just special files) for my NTFS file system driver for Linux (not
the one based on the current NTFS driver).  This could be implemented as
an ioctl() to the file system itself for individual files, however,
these types of attributes use a unique naming convention that could be
easily trapped by the fileutils (ls, mv, etc.) and treated transparently
as a file on any FS in linux.  
i.e.  The NTFS method is filename:attribute_name.  This means folks just
append :attr_name to the filename to tell the underlying FS to open an
alernate attribute file.  In this way, this method could be implemented
across all the FS's in Linux.  The question is whether utils check for
the ':' character in the name stream.  You need to expose this lower
down since NTFS will store them as attributes, but other FS's could
store them as alternate files, much the same as is done with HFS and
Macintosh resource forks and finderinfo today in Linux.  
In NTFS proper on NT, they are implemented as special files.
The question is whether the linux fileutils and code paths will barf is
they see an ':' in the filename.  You could parse this in the VFS and
indirect to an attribute file, but some FS's like NTFS would want to
deal with the name string directly.  If this something too alien to
Linux, or  dumb idea, and what do you think?  Something like on HFS
would do nicely.
Please advise,
:-)
