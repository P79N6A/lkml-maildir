I am not getting into this debate, just wanted to point out that
effect of compiler optimization on UNIX kernels have been studied
before. One paper I recall is  -
http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/sf94/full_papers/partridge.ps
They used prfile-guided optimization, so that is whole another angle altogether.
Thanks
