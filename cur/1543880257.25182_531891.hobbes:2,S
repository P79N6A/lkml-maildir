It is unreasonable to expect single allocations this large to succeed on a
32-bit OS. Either get a 64-bit OS or use a number of smaller allocations.
You may want to use mmap'ed files instead of malloc'ed memory. You can them
mmap however many files you can at once, and unmap and remap them as needed.
