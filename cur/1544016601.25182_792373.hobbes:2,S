I want to explore this assumption a little.  Logically, yes, if 50% of pages are free and we have 4096 cpus, the chance that a page is free on all CPUs is 1 in 2^4095.  But maybe such systems are fine with 2M pages for per-cpu areas at boot?  And can page mobility tricks help us make the odds reasonable here?
Only allowing movable pages in our expansion-of-percpu area?
Thanks,
Rusty.
