The case is more complicated here. gcc before 4.0 always assumed that
bar(&foo); initializes foo. gcc-4.0 now looks into bar if it is inlining
that and tries to find out if that really initializes foo in every
case.
In the example, bvec_alloc_bs does not initialize &idx when nr is not
between 1 and BIO_MAX_PAGES, so gcc is telling the truth here.
