Well no, even this is still wrong.
What you don't understand is how usb_root_hub_lost_power() works.  It 
doesn't actually do much of anything itself; it simply sets a flag in 
the root hub's device structure.  Then later on, when the hub driver 
is resumed it will see the flag and disconnect all the devices below 
the root hub.
In your case the last step won't work, because the hub driver will
never be resumed since it wasn't suspended to begin with.  You need to
use a completely different approach.  For instance, you could force
ohci-hcd to report connect-change events on all the ports.  Perhaps it
does something like that anyway, in which case you wouldn't have to
worry about it.
