I'm in full agreement with that, which is why I made the suggestions I
did as to how the effects of introducing capabilities could be kept as
secure as possible.

True, but what I was getting at is that you responded to what I
consider to be a very valid point by nit-picking my poor use of
English rather than responding to the point. I could've done the same
with you several times, but gave you the courtesy of responding to
what you clearly meant to say instead...

I believe this is where we have been confusing each other: You appear
to believe that all capabilities are security related, and I believe
that whilst there are many capabilities that are security related,
other capabilities can and should be defined to help optimise the use
of the system. It is some of the capabilities in this latter group
that I am referring to in the above, as quite clearly many (but not
all) security related capabilities do not belong there.
In addition, I believe that security-related capabilities of the "I do
NOT require..." variety can safely be placed in the file since they
can only REDUCE the abilities of the file, and it is only capabilities
of the "I additionally require..." variety that can not safely be put
in there.

That was just plain bad english, and I apologise for it. What I meant
to say is betteer phrased in the two paragraphs preceding it...

Perhaps because the author of the foobar program forgot to include
anything resembling a --version option, so the command doesn't know
what to do with it anyway...       8-)

Like I said in my previous post, any such capabilities embedded in the
file would need to be ones that applied to ALL runs of the program.
Common exceptions like --help and --version could be dealt with by a
capability that says that it runs if either of those is supplied,
irrespective of any other capability.
However, thee capabilities I would see being encoded into the file are
ones like "I do not require X to do my job", where those aren't
exceptions anyway.

I'm still not sure what point you're trying to make with your examples
above, so can't comment on this one.

Call them what you will, they fit the definition of "capabilities" you
gave some time back, so if you wish to exclude them, you'd best
tighten up your definition.

I presume you mean "run" rather than "read", in which case that's the
point I was trying to make.

I wouldn't include that property, but a "This page needs a browser
that can handle graphics" property would save me quite a lot of time,
as I'm a heavy user of lynx and there's nothing more frustrating than
waiting for some page to load over a slow link only to discover that
it displays as a screen full of "[IMAGE]" tags and nothing else.

To me, that is a "security-related capability" whereas the "needs X"
and "needs a graphical browser" capabilities are from the "functional
capability" group and the "needs ELF" and "needs JAVA" capabilities
aare from the "system capabilities" group.

If so, I'd love to know how. Certainly, I've never seen anything but
problem reports relating to this aspect of script behaviour.

I have no disagreement with that, where those rights are
security-related. However, some of the possible capabilities can't be
sensibly stored anywhere else, as you admitted above.

The proposals I've seen relating to this are ones that I'm in
agreement with, and can all be summed up by saying that the
capabilities that can safely be stored in the file are those that
REDUCE the abilities of the binary if they're set. I see nothing wrong
with that at all, and the only proposals I've seen suggesting any
similar treatment for capabilities that ENHANCE the abilities of the
binary were promptly withdrawn following POLITE comments from others
on this mailing list.

I have to admit that you came very close to my killfile before I
realised that your apparently constant attacks were unlikely to be
intentional...

Two questions:
 1. If so, why did you rubbish the idea both times it appeared in
    this mailing list?
 2. You appear to be claiming that I said otherwise than above.
    Could you advise me where, as I have no recollection of doing
    any such thing?

Several questions:
 1. What UID backup account? I've never seen a system with a
    specific account for doing backups from.
 2. Why 'she'? I've used 'he' because in English, that's the
    gramattically correct way of referring to somebody whose
    gender is unknown, but your use of 'she' implies that the
    person doing the job is always female.
 3. You appear to haave problems with the idea of there being
    mor thn one backup system available on a system. Why?

That's not how I read the comments. My reading was that the
justification for storing capabilities that REDUCE the abilities of a
binary within the file was that suchlike reductions would apply no
maatter where the binary in question was run from, and the said
capability would thus be CORRECTLY exported by existing tools.

No cop-outs please!!!
The instinctive reaction of any NOVICE Unix sysadmin (which all too
many are) is indeed "root", but for you to automatically assume that
everybody you converse with falls into that class and you're the only
one who doesn't is a far worse cop-out than the one you offered above.
