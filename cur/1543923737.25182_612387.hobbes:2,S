I have added the patches and started a linux kernel compilation, and
something really interesting happens.  I run the build with the
equivalent of "make -j3" and in a separate console I am watching the
build with 'top'.  The build consumes 98% of both CPUs.  If I stop the
output in the build console with "Ctrl-S", one core goes to idle,
while the other is in 50% waiting, then goes to 75% waiting.  When I
resume the build with "Ctrl-Q", the build starts to use both CPUs at
98-99%.  The NFS4 use was minimal, as I did not login with Gnome, but
just logged on the console.  Also, the CPU that is in 75% waiting
state changes occasionally.  'Top' shows pdflush in D state, using
5-6% of CPU.
Cheers,
florin
