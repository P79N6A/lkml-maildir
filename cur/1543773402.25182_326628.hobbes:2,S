Subject says it all actually.  No error messages, nothing.  sysrq is
the only thing that responds to me.
sysrq+p shows process umount.  EIP is at umount_tree+0x40/0x110
I assume the stuff below the registers is the stack.
do_munmap+0x11b/0x150
sys_munmap+0x44/0x70
do_umount+0x139/0x1e0
__user_walk+0x46/0x60
sys_umount+0x8d/0xa0
do_munmap+0x11b/0x150
sys_munmap+0x44/0x70
sys_oldumount+0x15/0x20
syscall_call+0x7/0xb
