This patch updates UML to 2.5.69.  In addition, I merged in all of the 
outstanding changes from the 2.4 UML tree.  Highlights of these include:
	Added SIGWINCH support to skas mode, eliminating the 
'userspace: child stopped with signal 28' error.
	Fixed the process segfault bug exposed by Kylix.
	Changed the serial line major number from TTYAUX_MAJOR to TTY_MAJOR.
	Changed all stat() calls to stat64().
	Removed hostfs and ubd support for root-hostfs, since booting a hostfs
filesystem is possible without any special support.
	Expanded the information available from /proc/cpuinfo.
	UML should run on RH9 now.
	Sound works in skas mode.
	Multi-line strings are gone, so gcc 3.2 and 3.3 should be happier.
	Fixed a hostfs file creation mode bug.
	Fixed a file access time bug.
