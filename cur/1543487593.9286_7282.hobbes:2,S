Umm if you can write to it atomically, that solves everything.
And I think I have the (x86) solution.... cmpxchg8b.
It's only an issue on SMP, which means it only matters on Pentium
and up (linux deosn't support SMP 486's, right?), so we have cmpxchg8b.
It's kind of kludgey, but you can use it to write (as long as you know
the old value and allow for the possibility of looping if there may be
concurrent writers), and to read.  Just load all 4 registers with 0,
and when you're done, the value is in EDX:EAX.  If it was 0, it got
rewritten, but as long as %edx == %ecx and %eax == %ebx, the written value
won't actually change anything.
Of course, it means that either you have some ugly code or you have to choose
betweeen SMP support and being able to boot on a 486, but isn't that the
case anyway?
