A first non-scientific feedback report. 
Much better performance in terms of xruns with Jackd. Hardly any at all
as it should be. I'm starting to test -rt8 right now. 
Now, I still don't have an smp machine to test so the improvement could
be because I'm just running 64 bit up instead of smp. Or it could have
been the hardware on that other machine that had some problem (either
because it was starting to fail or because the kernel drivers for that
hardware were somehow triggering the xruns). 
Anyway, looks good!
Thanks.
