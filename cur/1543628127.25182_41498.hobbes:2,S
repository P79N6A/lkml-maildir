Subject: Re: [PATCH] Remove Bitkeeper documentation from Linux tree
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Daniel,
This is not documentation for bitkeeper but how to use bitkeeper 
effectively for kernel development. It happens to be DAMN USEFULL 
documentation at that for anyone wanting to use bitkeeper for kernel 
development so IMO it fully belongs in the kernel. Just like the 
SubmittingPatches document does, too. Or are you going to remove that as well?
If you don't want to use bitkeeper you don't need to read this 
documentation. Just ignore it and stick with what is SubmittingPatches 
document.
What's your problem?
Best regards,
Anton
