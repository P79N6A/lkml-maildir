Well, the relayfs poll implementation is based on completed
sub-buffers, so you can be writing events into a buffer, but until a
buffer switch happens, you won't be notified that anything's changed.
The reason for the sub-buffer granularity is that relayfs was
originally meant for use only with mmap(), but now that there's a
read(), I'll probably have to make some changes to the poll
implementation as well.
