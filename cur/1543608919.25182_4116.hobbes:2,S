Hi,
still,
char name[80]
if (sscanf(line, "%4u %4u %llu %80s", &major, &minor, &size, name) == 4)
would safeguard you agains whatever you might read from your line, this is 
better protection agains buffer overflows than looking up the code that you 
think you'll be reading the output from. This code is NOT under your control, 
usually...
