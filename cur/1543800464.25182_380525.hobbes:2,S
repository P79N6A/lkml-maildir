Well, i'd like to help in any way i can, but i'm not really a programmer :(
It seems also that xawtv on nvidia cards (using either nvidia binary
module or nv), at least, somehow doesn't know how to use the hardware to
scale the image in overlay mode. So if you use tvtime which i just
installed and running it is now fullscreen in overlay mode using the
card hardware (quite technical stuff so i'm not sure what else to say).
But back to grabdisplay, this causes the freezes/crashes, especially
under heavy load it'll happen very quick. It seems maybe that other
hardware combinations maybe do not suffer quickly from these things or
ppl with other videocards maybe (?)
It seems to be a combination of factors which might lead to these
issue's, maybe some bug in the bttv code, combined with nvidia cards for
example and xawtv using grabdisplay causes the freezes/crashes.
I'm now currently using tvtime instead of xawtv, overlay mode (i hope),
fullscreen which is basically why i had to use grabdisplay with xawtv in
the first place. I'm putting now alot of load on the system and hope
this is the solution (for now) ...
