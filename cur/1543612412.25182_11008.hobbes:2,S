You'd need to learn CML2 perhaps, but not Python.
If you don't want to learn Python, you can think of it as an opaque
run-time system for _Eric's_ implementation of a CML2 interpreter if you
like.
If someone else did a C or Perl version, CML2 would remain the same, but
the Python run-time system could be dropped perchance.
