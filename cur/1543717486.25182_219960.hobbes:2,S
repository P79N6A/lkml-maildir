actually I was thinking about setting a flag that no more ISOC URB's are
submitted, because the device will still work if the second interface is
disconnected. The ISOC interface is only needed if an SCO link is opened
which would never happen when the Bluetooth chip is configured to route
the SCO traffic over an external PCM interface. Let me think a little
bit about the best way.
