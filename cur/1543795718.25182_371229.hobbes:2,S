Tony,
 may I suggestinstead making the verifier allow a small error?
I don't find it at all unlikely that some EDID blocks might say that only 
a 60Hz refresh rate is allowed. A lot of LCD's are literally specced for 
that (just read their manuals), even though they often in practice allow 
other frequencies (often _wildly_ different - most modern LCD's are 
perfectly happy to sync up with almost anything).
And if a monitor says that it wants a vertical frequency of 60Hz, a mode 
that has a frequency of 59 should certainly be accepted.
So it sounds like something has marked a perfectly valid mode as invalid, 
just because it's not _exactly_ at the frequency.
So how about allowing a small error in the frequencies in 
fb_validate_mode()? And make sure to try to round the divisions to 
nearest, not down. Something like the appended (totally untested)..
