Forewarning ... i ain't "qualified" ... heck i couldn't get my gfx card to 
work on 2.6 until yesterday (and i still don't know why that was).
ANYWAY
i got the same symptoms, and the reason it was doing it on my system was that 
in the config i was using in several places it referenced the wrong chipset. 
via instead of nforce2 type thing. 
From memory it did this all over the place with regards to sound, hdd and 
memory. 
Check
Device Drivers - ATA/ATAPI/MFM/RLL
Character Devices - AGP Support
		  - i2c Support
Sound 
etc ...
I'm sorry if this is completely useless. But it was what was at fault here.
PS there could be others that i can't remember ... just check for the right 
chipset.
