Obviously, the interface looks good to me now.
Please remember to add the function prototypes to
include/linux/syscalls.h.

This is whitespace damaged, as are the other four functions in the
same place.

Any reason for using fget() here, but fget_light() in sys_preadv?

Maybe this logic could get moved into a compat_readv() function,
similar to vfs_readv(). The advantage would be that we can make
the native and compat paths more similar.
