This consideration is wholly irrelevant to the pertinent topic,
because the very issue arises from devices being non-compliant.
If we want them to operate, we have to apply workarounds, which
may but us outside of the spec envelope. So I am not even going
to argue if the spec in fact mandates this behaviour.

I explained why this technique is not applicable to 2.4 in the part
of the message you failed to quote. To recap, if bulk methods were
simply to drop locks with a "couple of lines of code", they would allow
control transfers to happen simultaneously with bulk transfers.
It happens to work in 2.6 only because of its string caching feature.
Indeed, Stuart Hayes of Dell reported that he can cause TEAC CD-210PU
to break under 2.6.16 in the same way it did in 2.4.27, simply by doing
"lsusb -v" instead of "cat /proc/bus/usb/devices". The issue is still
with us. Greg chose to bypass it in 2.6, instead of fixing it, due
to the amount of work involved.
This is a fixable issue, but it's not two lines of code. And its
impact is very limited. If you, the person who actually suffers, are
not willing to do the necessary work, then why would anyone else be?
Still, I would be happy to consider your patch, if it were to emerge.
