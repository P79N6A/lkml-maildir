I found that the patch Robert has provided hasn't gone into 2.6.24-rc5 so maybe it is not working.
At the same time I did apply a small patch to 2.6.24-rc5 that seems to fix the issue.
I feel this could just be added to 2.6.24-rc5 without Robert's patch because of Jeff Garzik's" sata_nv: don't use legacy DMA in ADMA mode (v3)" patch.
It doesn't work without this patch because there is an allocation of memory from  hpriv before the mask can be set.
Please review.
