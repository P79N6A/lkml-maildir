What you are left with is a file made up of more than one part. Not
multiple files. And not fixing the "two major flaws in NTFS's approach" -
it's certainly the first I've heard of them, and something that must be
shared by any other existing implementation of the same thing, considering
what they have in common.

No. They ARE parts of a single file. If they were independent blocks of
data with names living in a directory, then they WOULD be files,
yes. However, they are not.
I don't want to sound like I'm disputing everything you say for the sake
of it (honestly, this isn't the case) - but there are fundamental  
differences between files and named streams/forks, and they must be
treated as such.
