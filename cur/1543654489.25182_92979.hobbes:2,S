    Hi all :))
    A time ago I was able to generate bootable Linux CD's just by
dd'ing a floppy containing a raw kernel image:
    dd if=/dev/fd0 of=eltorito
    After that, mkisofsing, toasting and booting. But now, depending
on the machine, I have 'invalid compressed format' errors, or even
ye olde register dump when the image was damaged :(
    Booting directly from the floppy works, but booting with that
same image from a CD does not :(( I now I can use LILO, or better
yet, Syslinux or isolinux, but I'm just curious why I cannot boot raw
image-based CD's anymore.
    Anyone knows what's happenning here?
