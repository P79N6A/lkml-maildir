I am using the current git and I already have low wakeups per second
to begin with - 5-7  and out of that 25% are attributed to sky2. Not
sure if that matches up with the 1 hz + round_jiffies() logic.
But is it conceptually ok to make this deferrable? I suppose yes as
it's just a watchdog that checks if the link is up and delaying that
would not make a difference?
Thanks
