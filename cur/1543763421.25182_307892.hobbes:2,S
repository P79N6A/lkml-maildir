Sounds very reasonable, thanks. Also helps application latency,
because with the RT patches, I can tune the rt prio of softirq
execution (that's where bottom-half goes, doesn't it?) w.r.t. the
rt prio of the application threads.
However, if I understand things correctly, if you really need 
to disable all interrupts while doing the USB work, it will not
make any difference if IRQs are disabled while you are in the
USB IRQ handler, or if they are disabled for the same amount of 
work/time in the bottom-half code.

Basically, yes (as long as our company doesn't decide to stop the
linux experiments).
However, I depend on Ingo's RT patch, which is against the -rc series,
not against the -mm series. So I will probably not be able to apply
patches created against -mm.
