Hi,
I want to get the ip addresses of every interface in my host, is there any function within
the kernel that already does this??? I know there is a function, called ip_dev_find(u32
addr) in fib_frontend.c, where I can pass the ip address of an intefarce and it will
return me a net_device*. I want a function that does exactely the opposite. Is there such
a function in the kernel?? if so, can somebody point me to file??? 
If there is no such a function, then I can write it myself, but I need some help for that.
I don't know where the ip addresses of the interfaces are stored, is there something like
a linked list or table where each node or entry has a device and its ip address??? where
can i look for the ip addresses? and the devices???
Thanx in advance to all...
Xavier
