"The perfect is the enemy of the good."
The "perfect" cacheline separation achieved that way is at the cost of
destabilizing the kernel. The dense per-cpu business is only really a
concession to the notion that the counter needs to be split up at all,
which has never been demonstrated with performance measurements. In fact,
Robin Holt has performance measurements demonstrating the opposite.
The "good" alternatives are negligibly different wrt. performance, and
don't carry the high cost of rwlock starvation that breaks boxen.
