There are many different ways you can use it.  If I'm writing a configurable 
feature, I could make it depend on !CONFIG_STABLE, or I could ifdef my code out 
if CONFIG_STABLE is set, unless a more granular option is also set.  The 
maintainer of the code that uses the config option has a lot of flexibility, at 
least until we start enforcing standards.
