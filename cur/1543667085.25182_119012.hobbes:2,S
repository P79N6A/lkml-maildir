Currently - yes.
But I heard about patches that make __init usefull in modular case.
Why break them ?

Safely the following can be added:
+ #ifndef MODULE
+ __init
+ #endif
  C() {
But I heard that our policy is avoiding extra #ifdefs if possible... 
AFAIR, some __init functions were called (in 2.4 scsi code; I didn't check
newer code) indirectly, by pointers to them, from non __init code. It is
more dificult to detect such cases.
