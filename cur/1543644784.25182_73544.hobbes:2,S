We need to pre-compute the size because the block device layer wants
to know how big devices were so it can do sanity checking on the
incoming requests.  This was done in the historically by setting
blk_size[MAJOR_NR] to point to an array which contained the size of
the minor devices in kilobytes, and in the new world order, via the
set_capacity() call.
