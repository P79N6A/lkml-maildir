Well, that doesn't solve the fundamental problem that you can't get it
right without help of the user.  Maybe the best solution would be that
no driver is allowed to occupy a device without subsystem id unless
explicitly asked by the user to do so (that would also a good idea for
bttv btw).  A small PCI probing module would be one way to do that, but
it is certainly not the only one.  You could also do something like
adding a pcislot=... insmod option to the existing drivers.
just my 2 cent,
