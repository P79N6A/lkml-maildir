One of yours hand merged UML updates/fixes in, and another one broke it badly by introducing
sigprocmask(). Now there is a conflict between in-kernel sigprocmask() and
glibc's sigprocmask() (that UML uses to manage signal delivery to right thread).
Can we please change the name of in-kernel's sigprocmask() to avoid name clash? ;)
Jeff Dike is also seem to support idea of renaming the offending function.
Thank you.
Bye,
