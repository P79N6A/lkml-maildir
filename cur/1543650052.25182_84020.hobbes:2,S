I don't comment on the overall concept of the patch itself, it's not my 
area of expertise and it's too early in the morning to think about it ;-)
However, there are three issues to consider in the meantime:
* Documentation/CodingStyle problems.  You need to use standard 
one-tab-for-indentation formatting, just like the code around what you 
are adding/modifying.
* There is weird text translation in the patch (short example follows). 
 It may be better if you use mutt and vi to include your patch directly, 
without word wrapping, if attachments are getting mangled.
-		msq =3D msg_lock(msqid);
-		err =3D -EIDRM;
-		if(msq=3D=3DNULL)
-			goto out_free;
-		ss_del(&s);
-		=
* Linus probably won't see your email, he has threatened to flush his entire inbox when he returns from his trip ;-)
