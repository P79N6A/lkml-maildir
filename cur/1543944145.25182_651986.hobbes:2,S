It would be very nice to have a separate tree with _only_ API changes
that could be frozen well before Linus' merge window opens. It should be
a requirement that maintainers use this tree as a basis for testing API
changes and even test that their own changesets were properly integrated
with the changed APIs.
As it is, we tend to get the order entirely wrong: API changes typically
get merged _after_ the maintainer changes have been merged, and so no
API changes are ever really integration tested.
