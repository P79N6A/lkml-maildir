Hi,
You can give a look on user_path_walk() and user_path_walk_link() (see 
include/linux/fs.h), given you have the pathname. 
Given you have the inode number, you can get one of the references to it by 
using d_path() (see include/linux/sched.h). I just don't know how it works  
when there is multiple references to the same inode number (hard links).
