Same for ppc32. Anyway, I don't like MUST_HWCACHE_ALIGN because it
just disables redzoning, I'd rather allocate more and do both redzoning
and cache alignement.
In fact, I think cache alignement should be a property of all kmalloc
calls for any size > L1 cache line size for obvious perfs reasons, and
redzoning shouldn't change such a property...

ppc32 "normally" is cache coherent, that is with high end or desktop CPUs,
embedded CPUs aren't. Some archs like ARM arent't. But in this case, the
problem is related to a broken SCSI controller on the motherboard which
will cause corruption on non-aligned buffers (it basically always issues
memory write and invalidate cycles).
Anyway, I _still_ think it's stupid to return non-aligned buffers, both
for performances, and because that prevents from dealing with such cases,
typically the SCSI layer assumes alignement here among others...
Regarding O_DIRECT with an unaligned pointer, I haven't looked at this
case yet, I suppose it will be broken in a whole lot of cases.
Ben.
