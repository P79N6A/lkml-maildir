That means that it could only be used for optional filesystems otherwise
booting unattended is put into question.
A user set for a practical joke could prevent booting by leaving a medium in 
the drive. You could add options for not considering removable media, etc, 
but you get to a stage where you design workarounds. That'd be bad for core 
filesystems. Thus the need for a second improved system remains.
Aside from that adding the name to /proc/partions is a good idea but not 
universally usable.

Enable the kernel command line to understand devfs names.

It is reasonable. GUIs could use a unified way to learn volume names.
