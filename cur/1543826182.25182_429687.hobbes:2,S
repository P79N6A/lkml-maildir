The specs I have say the following about WRITE_BL_PARTIAL:
Samsung (csd v1.2 mmc v4.1):
0: means that only the WRITE_BL_LEN block size can be used for block oriented data write.
1: means that smaller blocks can be used as well. The minimum block size is one byte.
Sandisk (csd v1.1 mmc v1.4):
0: means that only the WRITE_BL_LEN block size can be used for block oriented data write.
1: means that smaller blocks can be used as well. The minimum block size is one byte.
The wording is identical from these two differing manufacturers, so I
suspect it comes from the original spec.

I am not aware of any bug reports in this area, so I can't comment.  In
fact, I see very few reports of MMC problems at all, so I just assume
that it merely works.  Unless folk report bugs to me...
I don't know what to do about this since I don't have any cards and
I've not seen any bug reports to investigate what's going on.  So I'm
just going to say "the code as it stands is correct as to my best
knowledge, please provide details of it's failings."
