Yes, it is separate from sysfs -- but it is _tied_ to the sysfs API.

But the information is being recorded in the wrong spot.  The correct test
should use device_can_wakeup, not device_may_wakeup.  The can_wakeup flag
is the one which records whether or not the hardware mechanism is actually
available.

They used to, but I changed it when I added autostop.  Looks like I need 
to change it back.

Okay.  I'll write a patch to eliminate autostop and those routines when
CONFIG_PM is off.
But that doesn't answer the question above: Should autostop check 
device_can_wakeup rather than device_may_wakeup?
Also: Does the quirk/bug detection logic clear can_wakeup, as it should?  
Or does it only affect may_wakeup?
