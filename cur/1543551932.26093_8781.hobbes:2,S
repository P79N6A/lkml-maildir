Good morning!  It's a new day and I have done some additional poking and 
prodding with this problem and have two things to report.
First, the error happened during "make dep".  Second, a second attempt at 
"make dep bzImage modules" was successful.
Conclusion, I probably did something weird though I don't know what.  If I 
can reproduce the problem, I'll report that.
For now, don't worry about it.
David
