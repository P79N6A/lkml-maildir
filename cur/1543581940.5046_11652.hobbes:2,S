This isn't an x86 world.  For most other architectures, there *must* be
a kernel driver.  Check out linux/drivers/video.  But what X is doing at
this point is taking over access to the video card and using it's own
driver.  So see, there needs to be no split of X.  I could also argue
that if video was moved into the kernel in that manner, stability would
decrease, but performance could be dramatically increased.

I find this to be a flawed argument.

I think GGI/KGI were overkill -- especially at the time.  But with the
advent of embedded systems, you simply just can't say "use X" anymore.
I believe that there needs to be basic 2D acceleration available in
kernel space.  They already have to be there for non-BIOS architectures,
so why not take advantage of them?

Check out GTKFb and Embedded QT.  Whip XFree86's ass?  But the author
was talking about writing kernel drivers *for* Xfree86...  You are
correct in the fact that this will never happen.  But as far as video in
the kernel, you are wrong.
