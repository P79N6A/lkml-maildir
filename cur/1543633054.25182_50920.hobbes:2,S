> How about the following approach, which MAY not be practical:
Please note that there have already been innumerable proposals of
how to merge kbuild 2.5, and all of them have been silently rejected.
What I keep pondering over is, what is it that Linus finds troublesome
about merging the whole of kbuild 2.5? More -- why has he decided to
keep this to himself? Something tells me the answer to these questions
might be the key to solving the whole kb25 merge problem.
Hmmmm, it's rather odd to have to write about someone in 3rd person
when you know they'll read the text; They'll even give it a bit of
thought and will likely have things to say. They won't let you know,
though. You've noticed Linus was a he in the "if you want kbuild 2.5,
tell Linus" mail, haven't you? If I was a psychologist, I might have
something interesting to say based on that information. :)
Oh well.
And as for your idea, I'd say it really is impractical. kbuild 2.5
can live in perfect peace with the old build system as it is.
