Versus Documentation/hwmon/sysfs-interface which uses
millivolts and milliamperes respectively.
Why not adopt the same convention?  (This applies to
many attributes, not just these two.)
Also, I'm kind of curious what you've thought about
power budgeting.  Example, a power supply ("regulator")
may be able to supply a voltage within a given range,
but only up to a maximum of 200 mA worth.
The model visible through these sysfs attributes seems to
be an either/or thing ... either regulating voltage, or
current, but not addressing the corresponding constraints
on the other one.

How about just "undefined" for all those min/max values?

Ditto re "milli" vs "micro".  Also, "requested" seems a bit opaque.
As a sum, maybe "total_mi{lli,cro}amps" would be more explanatory.
