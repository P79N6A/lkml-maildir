The MySQL people made a tool to reproduce MySQL-like load for the specific
purpose of not putting you through the database setup pain:
http://sysbench.sourceforge.net/
To simulate our InnoDB:
   -- use the tool to do "seqwr" and write out a 50GB file or so
   -- use the tool to make another file, about 30GB.
   -- use the tool to do "rndrw" to do random I/O over that 50 GB
      file, with the O_DIRECT flag on, with a bunch of threads doing
      16k reads/writes.
   -- use the tool to do random IO w/o O_DIRECT on the smaller file
      at the same time as the O_DIRECT run, also with a number of
      threads, doing smaller reads/writes.
This is happening on a machine with LVM2, as well as directly on
/dev/sdb2 (an IBM ServeRAID), so device-mapper shouldn't be an issue one
way or another.
The filesystem size is 270 GB on one machine (on /dev/sdb2) and 120 GB on
LVM2.

Well, sysbench should help you find the problem.
Let me know if I can help more.  Thanks for looking into this.
