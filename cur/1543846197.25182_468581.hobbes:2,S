Most applications use HAL as a backend for display brightness these
days. HAL still supports the old interface in /proc for the different
brightness drivers, though, but the conversion to the new interface is on
my TODO and I will do it this week. So userspace should have fixed this
soon, so go ahead ;-)
Btw, there's a patchset from Matthew Garrett [1] sent some time ago which
also converts the asus_acpi, ibm_acpi and the toshiba_acpi drivers.
