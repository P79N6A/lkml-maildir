That's actually the first thing I checked.
mchouque - /usr/src/kernel/linux %ulimit -s
unlimited
And for the record, ulimit -a yields:
-t: cpu time (seconds)         unlimited
-f: file size (blocks)         unlimited
-d: data seg size (kbytes)     unlimited
-s: stack size (kbytes)        unlimited
-c: core file size (blocks)    0
-m: resident set size (kbytes) unlimited
-u: processes                  16375
-n: file descriptors           1024
-l: locked-in-memory size (kb) 32
-v: address space (kb)         unlimited
-x: file locks                 unlimited
-i: pending signals            16375
-q: bytes in POSIX msg queues  819200
-N 13:                         0
-N 14:                         0

Anything else you'd like me to try?
