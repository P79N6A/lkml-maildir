Can you prove your claim about 2.6?
There is to the best of my knowledge nothing in 2.6.0-test4
that prevents a kernel compiled for CPU type N from working
with CPU types >N. Just to prove it, I built a CONFIG_M486
2.6.0-test4 and booted it w/o problems on P4, PIII, and K6-III.

How are 1 and 2 different? Both need support for CPU type N
or higher. Since a kernel configured for a lower CPU type
still works on higher CPU types, where is the problem?
(In case 2 configure for PIII and use that on PIII and P4.)
Maybe I'm missing something but I don't see any problem here.
