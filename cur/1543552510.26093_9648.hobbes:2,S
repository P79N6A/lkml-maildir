I'm not certain of the details but I do know that it is legal.
To date I've only heard of it on ISA bridges, in particular the PIIXE.
It's some kind of passive listening mode as opposed to actually claiming
the bus cycles.

Right but I don't think you actually have to respond.  Not that I think
this is a good idea, but it does appear to be legal.
