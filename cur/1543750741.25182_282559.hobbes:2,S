Subject: infiniband: rename two source files?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/3/104

drivers/infiniband/core/Makefile contains the following:
<--  snip  -->
...
ib_sa-y :=                      sa_query.o
ib_umad-y :=                    user_mad.o
<--  snip  -->
Is it planned to add other objects to ib_sa and/or ib_umad, or would you 
accept a patch to rename the source files?
