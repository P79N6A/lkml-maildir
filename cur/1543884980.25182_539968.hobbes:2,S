Thanks to everyone who sent bug reports.  I've backported all the fixes
and tweaks.
Changes since last 2.6.21 release (254):
1) Method for building launcher with out-of-tree build (patch from Tony Breeds)
2) SIOCBRADDIF definition for older libc headers (report by Wang Cong)
3) Warning suppression for put_user/get_user (Wang Cong report again)
4) Numerous typo fixes (Jeremy Fitzhardinge's eyes)
5) Rework of networking documentation (Glauber de Oliveira Costa's whining)
6) Block documentation includes new love scene.
Heroic hacking!
