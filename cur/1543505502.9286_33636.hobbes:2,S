Hi,
	I'm trying to port my patches that provide multithreaded core
dumps forward to 2.3.x. However, the code has been significantly 
restructured and the layering changed. The 'easy' solution is to
change the linux_binfmt structure to add another coredump function
on the end that handles multithreaded core dumps, and modify the code
in do_coredump to use that function instead. 
[The issue is that under 2.0.3x, you could dynamically load a module
to get multithreaded core dumps (it replaced the binfmt_elf set of
functions). Under 2.3.x this is no longer possible as the top level
coredump handler never passes multithreaded processes to the binfmt
coredump handler.]
However, maybe someone has a better idea.......
Philip
p.s. Maybe core dumps are a bad idea anyway and nobody uses them....
