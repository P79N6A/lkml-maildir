Ok, that makes it pretty clear we have a regression w/ 2.6.10. I really
appreciate your helping narrow down this issue. If you have the time,
could you test the three 2.6.10-rcX patches? 
You can find them here: 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/
And they apply independently (not cumulatively) ontop of 2.6.9
thanks
