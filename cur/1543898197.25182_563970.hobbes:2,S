While at it, could we please fix our borked WOL interface requirements, so
that the PHY is *never* to be powered down when WOL is active?  This is
another deficiency that userspace has to work around in halt(8)...
If WOL is enabled and supported in a device, the kernel must never do
anything that would cause that device to stop responding to WOL packets.
OTOH, if WOL is disabled, it would be very very nice indeed to be able to
tell the kernel that yes, it is to power down the PHY if it is not in use.
Laptops appreciate it a lot, and so do the switches (which will know they
don't have to forward any traffic over that port).
