Yes, I can duplicate it easily now:
	- running X with drm and the radeon driver
	- start a gish game up in 640x480 mode and start the initial
	  level.
	- as the laptop just can't handle the cpu demands of this
	  program, everything runs way too slow.
	- switch back to the console that I started X up on and hit
	  ctrl-C.
	- X dies, and the kernel oops happens.
And yes, it does only show up when I'm using drm/agp for me, as this is
the only way I've ever seen this error.  I can't really even get gish to
start up without drm, but I guess I could try to see if I can do that
later tonight.
Any testing you want me to do?
Oh, and this also happens on 2.6.10-rc3-bk8.
thanks,
