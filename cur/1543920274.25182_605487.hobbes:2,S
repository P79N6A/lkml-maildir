Subject: [PATCH 12/12] xfs: eagerly remove vmap mappings to avoid upsetting Xen
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

XFS leaves stray mappings around when it vmaps memory to make it
virtually contigious.  This upsets Xen if one of those pages is being
recycled into a pagetable, since it finds an extra writable mapping of
the page.
This patch solves the problem in a brute force way, by making XFS
always eagerly unmap its mappings.  David Chinner says this shouldn't
have any performance impact on filesystems with default block sizes;
it will only affect filesystems with large block sizes.
