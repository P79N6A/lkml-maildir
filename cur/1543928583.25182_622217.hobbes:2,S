I'm getting back to you but unfortunately with not so good
news.  Sorry Alex.
On the x3950 (configured single node) I encountered the below
problem when attempting to hotplug a PCIe adapter when 'pci_slot'
was loaded prior to 'acpiphp'.  I did not see the problem when
the drivers were loaded in the opposite order.
After the messages appeared, the hotplug operation did not 
complete and I was unable to recover hotplug functionality
without a reboot.  I attempted recovery by unloading both
drivers and then reloading only 'acpiphp' but even though
an LED for the slot that had received the problem triggering
adapter indicated that the slot was receiving power, the
sysfs slot power file indicated otherwise (contained 0).
So, I was unable to power off the slot to allow the removal
and reinsertion of the adapter.
FYI, the node contains 2 hotpluggable PCIe slots and 5
non-hotpluggable PCIe slots but 'pci_slot' only exposed
the 2 hotpluggable slots.  This does not appear to be due
to a 'pci_slot' driver problem since I looked at the DSDT
and SSDT and found that there are currently no _SUN methods
for the non-hotpluggable slots.
