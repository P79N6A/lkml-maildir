Hi.
Two problems with kernel 2.6.4 (SuSe 9.1):
1) When I use a Belkin F5U409 usb-serial converter:
     - when plugged directly into chipset (Intel ICH5), works great.
     - when plugged in through a USB 1.0 hub, works great
     - when plugged in throught USB 2.0 Hub (Belkin F5U237), fails.
       Failure mechanism is: Tx works, Rx does not.
Any further info someone needs, or thoughts?
Thanks
