I was suggesting that there are common cases where
the electrical parts at the drive (single drive) end are
taken care of.
what comes before is an hdparm -b 2 (tristate),
then power off drive,  then yank it out. (if the
PCI chipset supports it, and the driver supplies a
control method)
The parts that are still rough are when you put it back
in, it doesn't have the benefit of the BIOS transfer
speed/type initialization, or the ide driver's bus scan.
Bottom line for me, I think there's enough merit to this
(although not 100% - you can only dress up frankenstein
so much) , and I'm working on cleanups, so please don't
remove the code from the next version, and anyone else
working on it, please continue, that's all.
Jeremy
