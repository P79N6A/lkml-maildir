Hmm, is it possible for applications to create hotplug events? If it is,
this could a good idea as matter of system policies. Regardless, our
management applications interfaces with the firmware in terms of logical
drive numbers. Driver converts this number to the scsi host, bus, target etc
during all interactions with kernel. In order for applications to actually
notify kernel about arrival or removal of logical drives (hotplug event or
sysfs), it has to know the corresponding mapping used by driver, while
registering or would be registering, the device in question.
Since the mapping is private to the driver, it only can tell to application,
for a give logical driver *number* the corresponding scsi address

Again, there is no way for applications to relate H:C:T:L with a logical
drive number. This information must come from the driver.
