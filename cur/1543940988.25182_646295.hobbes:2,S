A driver couldn't possibly care about the mmu notifier anymore at that
point, we just agreed a moment ago that the list can't change under
mmu_notifier_release, and in turn no driver could possibly call
mmu_notifier_unregister/register at that point anymore regardless of
the outcome of hlist_unhashed and external serialization must let the
driver know he's done with the notifiers.
