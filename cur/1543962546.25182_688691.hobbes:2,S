whaa?  kmalloc is ready to be used quite early in boot.  It's a bit of a
concern that the CPU resource controller is doing stuff before even kmalloc
is ready to go.
What's the call path here?  Via cgroup_init_early()?  Does it need to run
that early?

I'd need to see the code.  If we end up doing
	if (counters_are_ready)
		increment_counter();
all over then place then we need to think harder.
Maybe we need a cgroup_init_late(), which can do memory allocations.  If
nothing actually needs to touch the counters before cgroup_init_late() runs
then that might be OK.
