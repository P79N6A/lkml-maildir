In the original "_>_", the 8-bit mpc_apicid is implicitly converted to int
before the comparison, as part of the "integer promotions" in the "usual
arithmetic conversions" (C standard lingo). The same happens in your "_-_<=0".
So what's the benefit of the rewrite?

No argument there, except that ">=" gets the job done in a cleaner way.
