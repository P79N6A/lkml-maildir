Mauro chopped my description on this patch...... The description above 
doesnt make any sense... It SHOULD read as follows:
The following patch caused some duplicated code in cx88-dvb.c:
[PATCH] v4l: 634: implemented tuner set standby on cx88 init
The cx88-dvb.c portion of this patch was already applied
in an earlier patch, entitled:
[PATCH] v4l: fixup on cx88_dvb for Dvico HDTV5 Gold
I love quilt and all, but AFAIK, no tool is 100% perfect for catching 
oversights like this.
The non-overlapping portions of each of these patches are still needed, 
and must not be discarded, so rather than reverting old patches, please 
just apply this fixup patch to remove the duplicated code.

Now, maybe my description was wordy, but the one-liner doesnt tell us 
ANYTHING meaningful.
Thanks.
