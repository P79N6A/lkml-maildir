This whole thing seems strange to me.
Why do you even know the algorithm is patented?  And if you
knew it was, why implement it?  If you implemented it and
then did a search you poisoned yourself.
I've not poked around in the routing code but it seems to me
that the kernel would need a longest-prefix match algorithm
already so you shouldn't have to look far for one.
As for asking the patent holder for a license.  If the
patent were owned by a network hardware company i cannot see
them licensing it because the speed of their equipment is
their competitive advantage.  But you indicated the the
patent is not owned by the HW company but exclusively
licensed.  An existing exclusive license would preclude
FLOSS being granted a license and a gratis sublicense would 
likely violate the existing license.
It would be completely OT to wonder at what point source
code crossed the line of expressing information of public
record into being a patent violation. <niggle>
