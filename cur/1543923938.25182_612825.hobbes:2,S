Subject: [PATCH 0/7] (Re-)introducing pvops for x86_64 - Real pvops work part
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hey folks,
This is the part-of-pvops-implementation-that-is-not-exactly-a-merge. Neat,
uh? This is the majority of the work.
The first patch in the series does not really belong here. It was already
sent to lkml separetedly before, but I'm including it again, for a very
simple reason: Try to test the paravirt patches without it, and you'll fail
miserably ;-) (and it was not yet included).
Other than that, I thank you all in advance for the review.
Have fun!
