I'm not sure I can see how you find "don't use cache" not cache related. 
Saving the resources needed for cache would seem to obviously leave them 
for other processes.

Did O_DIRECT ever use cache in some way? Doing DMA directly out of user 
space would seem to avoid using cache unless code was actually added to 
write to cache as well as disk, since the data isn't needed in any buffer.

In the sense that you must do DMA or use cache, yes.

But none of those advisories says how to cache or not, only what the 
expected behavior will be. So FADV_NOREUSE does not control cache use, 
it simply allows the system to make assumptions. If I still had the load 
which generated my cache problems I would try both methods while doing a 
large data copy, and see if the end result was similar. In theory 
NOREUSE "could be" more efficient of disk, but also use a lot of cache 
depending  on the implementation.
One of the problems with RAID-5 and large data is that you can read it a 
lot faster than you can write it (in most cases), resulting in filling 
the cache with data from one process. Perhaps a scheduler tunable for 
allowed queued disk data would help with this, but copying a TB data set 
has a very bad effect on other i/o.

Since tmpfs is useful for testing programs, this would have an actual 
user benefit.
