No...
On a 32 bit kernel (and on a 64 bit kernel using the native interface), 
count is passed to sendfile as unsigned. rw_verify_area explicitly casts 
to signed before checking for negativeness. The only place anywhere in the 
kernel that count is signed (other than where rw_verify area explicitly 
casts it for one test) is in the declaration of sys32_sendfile in the 
x86_64 compat code. I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be unsigned there 
too, and the current code is a typo.
