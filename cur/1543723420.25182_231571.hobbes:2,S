It doesn't - the ppp layer got burned badly by this long ago. set_bit is
not a memory barrier. OTOH you can just add an mb()
With respect to the need for a get_jiffies API I don't think you 
do need it for ratelimit.
	static DECLARE_TIMEOUT_EXPIRED(printk_timer);
	if(timeout_expired(t))
	{
		printk("Blah");
		timeout_set(t, 5 * HZ);
	}
