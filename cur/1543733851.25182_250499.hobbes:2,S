The other thing is, it is actually a lot nicer to have this done while
the machine is running, because then cpu_attach_domain guarantees a
quiescent state, so the attach can be done completely atomically from
the point of view of the rest of the scheduler.
So you can always rely on domains and cpu_online_map staying in synch.
The alternative is more fastpath checking of the cpu_online_map, and
possibly more hotplug locks.
In short, I'd really like to have it done this way.
