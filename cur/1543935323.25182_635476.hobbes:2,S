This changes bothers me.  Putting the last ref to a module in code
inside that module is not safe, which is why module_put_and_exit
exists. 
So this module_put is either unsafe or not needed.  I think the
latter.
As you say in the comment, lockd_down now blocks until lockd actually
exits.  As every caller for lockd_down will own a reference to the
lockd module, the lockd thread no longer needs to own a reference too.
So I think it is safe to remove the module_put, and also remove the
__module_get at the top of the lockd function.
Also, I suspect that the "no users" and "no lockd running" messages
should probably be changed to BUGs as they really should be
impossible, not just unlikely.

This comment should go as the actual check has gone.
The rest looks fine. It is a substantial improvement, thanks.
