And notebooks? I'm running a 64bit system with 2gig memory and a 7200
RPM disk. Without your patches a movie like Elephants_Dream_HD.avi
causes a continuous silent read. After patching 2.6.17-rc5 (more on that
later) there's a slow 'click-read-click-read-click-etc' during the
same movie as the head travels _somewhere_ to rest(?) between reads.
Distracting in silent sequences, and perhaps increased disk wear/tear.
I'll try adjusting the readahead size towards silence tomorrow.
But as size slides in a mainstream direction, whence will any benefit
come - in this Joe-average case? It's not a faster 'cp' at least:
_Cold boot between tests - Copy between different partitions_

Of course, my failure to see speed-ups could well be 'cos of a botched
patch transfer (or some kind of missing groundwork only available in
-mm). There was one reject in particular which made me pause. I'm no
programmer... and 'continue;' is a weird direction. At the end I settled
on:
[mm/readahead.c]

At least it hasn't eaten my (backed up) disk yet ;-)
