Btw, here's an updated console unregister patchset with signoff in the
off chance you like it right away. :)
When rmmod'd, some drivers might like to unregister the console they have
registered (e.g. the fbcon driver), so export unbind_con_driver.  It
properly cleans up console references and takes care of switching to
one of the other registered drivers as needed.
