A simple grep for cli() in drivers/char reveals that many of those drivers 
still use cli(), which means even they haven't yet been converted to the new 
framework.
As for the patch, other drivers, like cyclades, for example, too have been 
modified in the same manner.... on digging, I found that the original patch 
that converted the taskqueues to workqueues had also done it the same way.
