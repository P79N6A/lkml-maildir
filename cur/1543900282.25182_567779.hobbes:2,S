Subject: [git patches] ocfs2 and configfs updates

This represents the majority of our 2.6.23-rc1 patches.
I'll start with ocfs2, which gets the following new features:
* Full support for shared writeable mmap. This was implemented using the
  ->page_mkwrite callback to allow ocfs2 a chance to take cluster locks on
  the inode data and allocate file space for writes. This also has the
  effect that ocfs2 should never run out of space during ->writepage.
* Some internal improvements to how deallocation of meta-data is handled. 
  This simplified deallocation locking so that we could turn on allocation
  of meta data from per-node pools.
* Unwritten extents support. ocfs2 can now pre-allocate inode space without
  zeroing data by leaving a special "unwritten" flag in the extent record. 
  Reads from regions marked as unwritten return zeros and writes to the
  regions are guaranteed to never require data allocation. The sparse file
  support in Ocfs2 (from 2.6.22) included read support for unwritten
  extents, so the file system option is an RO compat bit. It won't ever be
  turned on by ocfs2-tools without first having the sparse files incompat
  bit set.
* Support for removing arbitrary file regions. Conceptually this is the
  opposite of unwritten extents support. The ocfs2 btree code is now smart
  enough to remove any extent or partial extent, regardless of where it is
  in the tree. Previously it was only possible to remove extents from the
  rightmost edge during a truncate.
The reservation and extent truncate support is exposed to user space via a
set of ioctls compatible with those currently used by XFS. This allows us to
take advantage of the existing install base of software which uses that
feature. Some weeks ago, I also posted an -mm patch to get ocfs2 under the
->fallocate() callback. Once the sys_fallocate() patches are merged, I
intend to send a version of the ocfs2 patch upstream.
On the Configfs side, these patches include a series of cleanups and some
API adjustments.
* Drivers now have the ability to specify a dependancy on config items. This
  allows clients to pin certain objects when removal would have bad
  consequences. ocfs2 uses this functionality to codify a mountpoints
  dependancy on a live heartbeat.
* A new notification callback, ops->disconnect_notify() is added which is
  called just before item linkage is broken during removal. This allows
  configfs users to do work on the item while it is still in the hierarchy.
Three of the configfs patches which modify the api touch code in fs/dlm (in
fairly trivial ways) so David has been CC'd. Those patches are also attached
to the end of this mail. I had to fix some conflicts with an fs/dlm/config.c
change when getting two of those ready for merge so the commit messages have
been marked as such.

[PATCH] configfs+dlm: Separate out __CONFIGFS_ATTR into configfs.h
fs/dlm/config.c contains a useful generic macro called __CONFIGFS_ATTR
that is similar to sysfs' __ATTR macro that makes defining attributes
easy for any user of configfs. Separate it out into configfs.h so that
other users (forthcoming in dynamic netconsole patchset) can use it too.

[PATCH] configfs+dlm: Rename config_group_find_obj and state semantics clearly
Configfs being based upon sysfs code, config_group_find_obj() is probably
so named because of the similar kset_find_obj() in sysfs. However,
"kobject"s in sysfs become "config_item"s in configfs, so let's call it
config_group_find_item() instead, for sake of uniformity, and make
corresponding change in the users of this function.
BTW a crucial difference between kset_find_obj and config_group_find_item
is in locking expectations. kset_find_obj does its locking by itself, but
config_group_find_item expects the *caller* to do the locking. The reason
for this: kset's have their own locks, config_group's don't but instead
rely on the subsystem mutex. And, subsystem needn't necessarily be around
when config_group_find_item() is called.
So let's state these locking semantics explicitly, and rectify the comment,
otherwise bugs could continue to occur in future, as they did in the past
(refer commit d82b8191e238 in gfs2-2.6-fixes.git).
