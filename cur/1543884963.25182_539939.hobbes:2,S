One might be a texture where a portion is updated by one thread
and another portion update by another one, i believe the application
will know better than us if such concurrent access will conflict or not.
If this both thread access different pixel it make sense to let them
work together at the same time on the texture. If they are writing
to same pixel then they will have to sync between them so they
don't do somethings stupid.
My point is that the user space will know better if sync is needed
or not and how to sync access to the same buffer. Moreover we
can still add a locking mechanism in user space (in libdrm for
instance).
There is very likely others use case for such concurrent access which
i can't think off right now.
best,
