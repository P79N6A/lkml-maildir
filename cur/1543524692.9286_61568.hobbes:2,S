Yes.

Yes, it's atomic.  It's the reason we still have activate_mm,
because we couldn't separate the two operations.

This doesn't happen because CPU1 did flush_tlb_other, either
by noticing that mmA wasn't running on cpu1, or by noticing
that mmA had more than one user.
But this leads to a different failing scenario:
	CPU0:				CPU1:
	switch_mm(A,mmA)
	  this implies A->thread.asn
	  and mmA->context are valid.
					flush_tlb_other(A)
					  this implies mmA->context is 0.
	switch_to(A)
	  Now A->thread.asn is out of
	  sync with mmA->context.
This will require some thought to avoid scrogging schedule entirely.
