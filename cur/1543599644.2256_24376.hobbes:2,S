Hello,
   I am using Redhat Linux 7.1
   During reboot, i get the message " Mounting / as readonly"
   And, it enters into maintenance mode...( & all other steps fail -
/proc not mounted, swap not mounted, fsck fails)
   I did the following :
   mount -t proc proc /proc
   fsck /dev/hda1
   The following error messages : ERROR : Couldn't open /dev/null
(Read-only file system)
   It goes into a never-ending loop, and never i am able to recover from
this problem.
   Has anyone come across such a problem? How to tackle it?
   Do we need to use a bootdisk, to get into the read-write mode of root
filesystem ?
   How to change root filesystem from read-only to read-write?
   This will be of very great help to me and my team.
Thanks in advance,
Venkatesh.
