OK, this is a significative finding.

In this case, hand-copying is still available. We've all done that a lot
of times and it does not take as long as you can imagine.

Well, at first, I did not find this driver, then I realized that it was
and USB one ! Its ethtool ioctl calls usb_control_msg() which is defined
in usb/usb.c. Look at the header :
 *      Don't use this function from within an interrupt context, like a
 *      bottom half handler.  If you need a asyncronous message, or need to send
 *      a message from within interrupt context, use usb_submit_urb()
 */
int usb_control_msg(struct usb_device *dev, unsigned int pipe, __u8 request,
So I think that the rtl8150 driver is simply buggy, or at least does not
expect to be used this way.

May be you can try to change the 2 usb_control_msg() calls for a
combination of FILL_CONTROL_URB() + usb_submit_urb ? Hmmm reading the
code, it looks like nearly everything is already provided. In
rtl8150_ethtool_ioctl(), you should try to replaces occurences of
get_registers() by async_get_registers() that you will write by
comparing set_registers() with async_set_registers().

Older versions were awful, but it ahs quickly stabilized and seems OK to me
in *recent* kernels.
