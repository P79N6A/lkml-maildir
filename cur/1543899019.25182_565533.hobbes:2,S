The NSLU2-Linux project (
http://www.nslu2-linux.org
) relies on the
pata-artop driver for the arm/ixp4xx-based Iomega NAS100d and D-Link
DSM-G600 NAS devices (both of which are supported in recent mainline
kernels).
Latest kernels (2.6.22-rc5 is the latest we've tested) have no reported
problems with pata-artop.  We have a handful of people (including
myself) who we know are using 2.6.22-rc5 on those devices and are
booting from the internal drive using the pata-artop driver.
I'm happy for anyone to contact me in the future if new versions of the
pata-artop driver need to be tested.  There are people using it :-)

Our project is also working on adding support to the kernel for the
Freecom FSG-3 NAS device.  It uses the sata-via driver for it's VIA_6421
chipset, but the main drive is a PATA drive (the device also has an
eSATA external port).
We're currently stuck at 2.6.18 with vendor patches for scsi/sata-via,
and would love to move to 2.6.22 and libata, but are having problems
with the latest sata-via driver for this chipset booting from an IDE
drive.  I'll contact you separately for this issue (as it's off-topic on
this thread).
Thanks,
