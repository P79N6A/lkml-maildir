well, the allnoconfig thing is artificial (and the uninteresting) for a 
number of reasons:
- it has REGPARM disabled which penalizes function calls
- it's UP and hence the inlining cost of init_wait_queue_head() is 
  significantly smaller.
- allnoconfig has smaller average function size - increasing the cost of 
  uninlining

yeah, i'd not want to skip over some interesting and still unexplained 
effect either, but 35 bytes isnt all that outlandish and from everything 
i've seen it's a real win. Here is an actual example:
 c0fb6137:       c7 44 24 08 00 00 00    movl   $0x0,0x8(%esp)
 c0fb613e:       00
 c0fb613f:       c7 44 24 08 01 00 00    movl   $0x1,0x8(%esp)
 c0fb6146:       00
 c0fb6147:       c7 43 60 00 00 00 00    movl   $0x0,0x60(%ebx)
 c0fb614e:       8b 44 24 08             mov    0x8(%esp),%eax
 c0fb6152:       89 43 5c                mov    %eax,0x5c(%ebx)
 c0fb6155:       8d 43 64                lea    0x64(%ebx),%eax
 c0fb6158:       89 40 04                mov    %eax,0x4(%eax)
 c0fb615b:       89 43 64                mov    %eax,0x64(%ebx)
versus:
 c0fb070e:       8d 43 5c                lea    0x5c(%ebx),%eax
 c0fb0711:       e8 94 98 18 ff          call   c0139faa <init_waitqueue_head>
so 39 bytes versus 8 bytes - 31 bytes saved. It's a similar win in other 
cases i checked too. (the only exception is for smaller functions that i 
mentioned before: where the parameters are not pre-calculated yet so 
there's no good integration for the function call. In that case it's 
break even, or in some cases a 3-4 bytes loss.)
