setfsuid() creates credentials which are _only_ applied to file
operations.  The namespace happens to be the same one that applies to
processes, but there's nothing that requires that to be the case, and
if you have a corresponding setfssid() to set the effective set for fs
access, you're explicitly requesting the fs namespace, not the process
one.

Definitely.  Application writers will need to be aware of that, just
as they have to be aware of the same for setfsuid today.  But when
you've got signal handlers doing complex work, you've got all sorts of
races opening up, and trying to fix every single one of them by
inventing new syscalls for every single combination of operation that
the app might want to do atomically makes no sense!
