Source bloat is certainly not desirable, as I said to my reply to Ingo.
What is desirable, however, is to have a uniform tracing mechanism
replace the ad-hoc tracing mechanisms already implemented in many drivers
and subsystems.

Sure, but there are no locks anymore in the tracer with the addition of
the lockless code which is part of the set of patches I just sent. So yes,
this was a problem with LTT, but it isn't anymore.
The lockless scheme is pretty simple, instead of using a spinlock to
ensure atomic allocation of buffer space, the code does an allocate-and-test
routine where it tries to allocate space in the buffer and tests if it
succeeded in doing so. If so, then it goes on to write the data in the
event buffer, otherwise it tries again. In most cases, it does this loop
only once and in most worst cases twice.

I fully agree with the requirements you list. LTT is already lightweight
in terms of its performance impact on the system and it doesn't use any
form of locking anymore. The only remaining issue is the use of per-CPU
buffers and this is currently being worked on by the team at IBM that
had already developed the lockless scheme and will be ready shortly.
However, there clearly is no more lock contention.
