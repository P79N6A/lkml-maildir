Ok, can you now install the 2.6.10-3 package from : 
  
http://people.debian.org/~luther/powerpc/2.6.10-3
 
(you need kernel-image-2.6.10-powerpc and mkvmlinuz), call mkvmlinuz on it (or
add it to kernel-img.conf as postinst_hook=/usr/sbin/mkvmlinuz).
You may probably want also to modify /etc/mkinitrd/mkinitrd:MODULES_DEP to dep
instead of MOST, or you may hit size problems with your initrd, i would be
interested in knowing that.
Then just dd your /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.10-powerpc to your prep partition, or
better yet to a tftp server, and try it out. If the scsi problems are there,
can you fill a bug report against kernel-source-2.6.10 ? 
Friendly,
Sven Luther
