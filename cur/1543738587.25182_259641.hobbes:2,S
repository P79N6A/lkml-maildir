You can mark an enum "bitwise" (by making all of it's values be
"bitwise"), and it will be considered a type of its own, yes. But then you
also cannot do arithmetic on it (which _usually_ is what you want, but not
necessarily always).
(You'd also need to pass in the "-Wbitwise" flag to sparse, to get the
checks).
By the time you mark something "bitwise", you don't even need to use an
enum, btw. You can just do a regular integer typedef and mark the typedef 
to be "bitwise" - that generates a unique type right there. That's what 
the endianness checking does.
