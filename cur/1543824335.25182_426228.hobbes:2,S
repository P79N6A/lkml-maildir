Are you using io barriers?
[PATCH] blk: fix gendisk->in_flight accounting during barrier sequence
While executing barrrier sequence, the bar_rq which carries actual
write was accounted as normal IO on completion, while it wasn't on
queueing.  This caused gendisk->in_flight to be decremented by 1 after
each barrier thus messed up statistics.
This patch makes bar_rq not accounted as normal IO.  As the containing
barrier request as a whole is accounted, part of it shouldn't be.
