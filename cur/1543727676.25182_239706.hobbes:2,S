Subject: [BUG] 2.6.8-rc3 jffs2 unable to read filesystems
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The following two messages sum up the problem:
JFFS2 compression type 0x5a06 not avaiable.
Error: jffs2_decompress returned -5
It appears that a jffs2 change committed on July 15th has caused recent
2.6.8-rc kernels to be incompatible with jffs2 filesystems modified by
previous kernel versions.
The "new format" jffs2 filesystem uses both "compr" and "usercompr"
of the jffs2_raw_inode structure, whereas previous implementations
left "usercompr" uninitialised and thus contains random data.
This can be seen by tracing through the code from jffs2_alloc_raw_inode()
and noticing that previous implementations do not initialise this field -
AFAICS kmem_cache_alloc() does not guarantee that memory returned by
this function will be initialised.
Therefore, recent 2.6.8-rc kernels must _NOT_ use this field if they
wish to remain compatible with existing jffs2 filesystems.
