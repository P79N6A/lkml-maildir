It's useful sometimes.  Debian/sarge for example doesn't work with xvd
block devices.  At least not out-of-the-box, it needs some manual
tweaks.  Probably it also is handy when moving real machines into an
virtual environment.  I don't think it should be dropped.
Most modern udev-based distros work just fine with xvd though.

Print a big fat warning?  And also change the example config files in
the xen source tree to use xvda not hda to advertize them more than we
do right now.  I think lots of users don't even know about the xvd
devices ...
cheers,
