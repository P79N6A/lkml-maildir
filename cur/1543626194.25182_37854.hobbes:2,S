Interesting. How about plain 2.5.6: does devfsd hang there as well?
Also check 2.4.19-pre5 both with and without devfs-patch-v199.11.
Since there appears to have been some change that has broken things,
you'll need to narrow down the particular pre-patch that caused the
breakage. Also, I'll need to see a list of processes currently running
when the hang occurs, plus an strace of devfsd.
