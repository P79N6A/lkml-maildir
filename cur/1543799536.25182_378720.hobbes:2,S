Regressions are worse than other bugs since they break working setups 
after a kernel upgrade, and should therefore be fixed before 2.6.15 
gets released.
This should in no way imply that other severe bugs shouldn't be fixed.
One thing why I'm currently pointing to such regressions is that I can't 
stand people whining noone would test -rc kernels while we aren't even 
able to handle all the regressions reported by people who actually do 
test our -rc kernels.
