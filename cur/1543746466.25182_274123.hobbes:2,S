Hi,
I'm experiencing the same problems, see:

I'm having the same problem with a 2port card. After a cold boot, the 
transceivers are not found and I need to do a reset. Afterwards, 
everything is fine.

For me, yes. I'm using one port to connect to my adsl provider. After a 
cold boot, this fails.

I don't know.
Can you try to reboot the machine and see if the problem goes away (ie. 
the transceivers are found)?
Do you have a 2.4 kernel where the card works after a cold boot?
So far nobody has come up with a solution and I don't reboot the machine 
that often. But it's "good" to know that I'm not alone with the problem. ;-(
CU
Michael.
