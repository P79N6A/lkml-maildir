Hmm, I wasn't aware of this.  The manpage confirms what you're saying
and adds that the information may or may not be reflecting the current
state.
However, Dennis's -I output also shows udma6 as the mode the drive is
in, and -I info -- according to the manual -- is obtained "directly
from the drive," which I read as "let's ask the drive what it's set
up like at this moment."
Dennis, could you possibly post the "hdparm -v" output too?
