Actually, here's a simple patch from -next that should test this logic
for you.  Can you let me know if this solves the start up WARNING dump

Subject: PCI: add is_added flag to struct pci_dev
This lets us check if the device is really added to the driver core or
not, which is what we need when walking some of the bus lists.  The flag
is there in anticipation of getting rid of the other PCI device list,
which is what we used to check in this situation.
