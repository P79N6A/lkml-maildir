Each log you've shown so far shows you getting updatedb stuck in D which 
appears to be the common link. It could be your updatedb is busy scanning 
directories it probably shouldn't.
Check your updatedb.conf (usually in /etc) and see that you have at least 
these entries in PRUNEFS
PRUNEFS="nfs,smbfs,ncpfs,proc,devpts,supermount,vfat,iso9660,udf,usbdevfs,devfs,usbfs,sysfs"
