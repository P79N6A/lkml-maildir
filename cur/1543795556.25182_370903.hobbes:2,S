This seems rather generic.  I recently added one entry:
	{	/* Handle problems with rebooting on HP nc6120 */
		.callback = set_bios_reboot,
		.ident = "HP Compaq nc6120",
		.matches = {
			DMI_MATCH(DMI_SYS_VENDOR, "Hewlett-Packard"),
			DMI_MATCH(DMI_PRODUCT_NAME, "HP Compaq nc6120"),
		},
	},
But your patch will do this for all HP laptops, will it not?  Worrisome. 
Is it not possible to identify particular models?
