I think it's unusual for a machine with 256M of RAM to use more
than ~512M for swap, but I certainly wouldn't advise you against it.
If you've plenty of spare disk, and you find that sometimes it is
almost all useful for swap, keep it that way.  But I can't pretend
that tmpfs is efficient compared with other filesystems once it
gets into using swap.

Sorry, you'll know much more about configuring such systems than I do.
