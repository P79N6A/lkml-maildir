Yes, I'm reluctant at changing anything set by the BIOS before the first
*use* of the module. In particular, if the watchdog was not activated by
default in the BIOS, I'd prefer the box not to reboot just because the
module was loaded (maybe by mistake) if no daemon open /dev/watchdog
at least once.
In particular, some boxes may take a long time to boot, e.g. if fscks are
needed; if the module is loaded by an initrd before filesystems are mounted
and fscks are done, if I'm not mistaken the box could reboot in loop
every time in the middle of fscks.
