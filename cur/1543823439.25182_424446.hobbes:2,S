events is used for a lot of things. Can you send lspci and dmesg 
output? Can you try leaving the system totally idle (no network traffic, etc) for 
a while and see if that delay before events begins looping is affected?
Do you have an earlier or later kernel release you can test/confirm as
affected or unaffected? It's not much fun, but if you can find a kernel 
that properly works, it's always possible to do a bisect...
