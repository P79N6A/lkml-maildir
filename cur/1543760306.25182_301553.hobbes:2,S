Thanks for the suggestions.  It wasn't very important to me so I didn't
make time to follow up on it.  I was just playing w/ ccache at the time.
Finally I noticed this patch from -mm1... and it solves the problem.
nfsd--lockd-dont-try-to-match-callback-requests-against-export-table.patch
How I tested: I applied the first 12 patches in 2.6.11-mm1; the above
mentioned was last - couldn't reproduce the bug.  When I unapplied just
that one, I saw it again.
original bug report:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=110238645132535&w=3
Greg: have you considered this one for 2.6.11.x?
Thanks,
