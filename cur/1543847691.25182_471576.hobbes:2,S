From my understanding, a cute userspace App shouldn't have this kind
of logic:
	if (is  DELL )
		invoke libsmbios
	if (is  foo)
		invoke libfoo,
	if (is bar)
		invoke libbar,
	....
	else
		operate on /sys/class/backlight/ ,.,..
It should be:
	just write/read  file in  /sys/class/backlight ,....
Right?
Thanks,
Luming
