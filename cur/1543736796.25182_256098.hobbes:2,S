If you grab the 2.6.8.1-ac patch you can do IDE controller hotplugging
and a few other things but not yet drive hotplugging. 2.4 can do drive
hotplug although you need a small -ac patch if you see wrong disk
geometry data.
For new controllers (ie SATA ones) use Jeff Garzik's serial ATA layer as
that is a lot cleaner and the SCSI layer already has a good basic
understanding of hotplug management.

Except for the dynamic stuff I consider the problem solved. Its up to
you when and what you merge and I understand why you want to get stuff
like sysfs there. 
For drive level hotplug its actually a lot easier and I guess that is
the case most users care about. The changes done for 2.6 clean up stuff
like suspend mean the nasties in 2.4 for sequencing have gone away. No
refcounting needed since the block and fs layer are doing it all for
you. TTY layer, revoke(), and some other current critical bonfires first
before I can help with that however.
