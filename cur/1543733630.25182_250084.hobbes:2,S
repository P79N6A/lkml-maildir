Dear All,
Please give me some hints on where to look and what possibly to do to
bring system back to usable without rebooting, or at least to catch what
can be a problem.
I've discroverd that mozilla-firefox didn't want to start - just hanged
during start... well - I've found that 'fuser -m /dev/dsp' causes it to
stall... well - I've fount that any fuser process stalls... well... I've
found using strace that they stall around next point:
getdents64(4, /* 0 entries */, 1024)    = 0
close(4)                                = 0
chdir("/proc/26336")                    = 0
stat64("root", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=720, ...}) = 0
lstat64("root", {st_mode=S_IFLNK|0777, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
stat64("cwd", 
well.. I've tried to cd to /proc/26336 and my bash got frozen as well...
now my sytem load is around 20 probably due to all the unkillable fuser
processes I've ran so far... They look like:
yoh      29083  0.0  0.0  1532  560 ?        D    00:48   0:00 fuser -m
/dev/dsp
no abnormal logs are reported in syslog... 
What can I do to find the cause or to resolve the situation somehow
without reboot? Which else hints can I provide? I'm reporting main
system params and linux kernel config on
http://www.onerussian.com/Linux/bugs/bug.proc/
(Many other tools like df stall as well)
Thank you in advance
