Yes but fdisk, cfdisk and parted doesn't have this feature either. Those
are what people use most often from the command line for interactive
partitioning (use the right tool for the job).
Saving the table with sfdisk is the best but imperfect workaround. sfdisk
can't know what steps will be done later on with a different partitioning
tool. 
But at least its data should be enough to diagnose problems in the other
partitioning tools.
