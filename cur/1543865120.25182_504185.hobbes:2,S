I'm not sure I understand your point. To support SGPIO initiators
incorporated
into SATA host controllers, it is pretty much inevitable that some SGPIO
support
will have to be added directly into individual drivers for thoese
controllers;
the SGPIO standard does not define a register level interface for
accessing
this functionality, so vendor implementations vary.
It's possible that with an SGPIO initiator integrated within a SAS host
controller,
you may be able to use SMP frames to access it, using the messaging
defined in
SFF-8485 chapter 8 - but I wouldn't bank on it.

Adding SGPIO support directly into an individual SATA driver seems to be
a very bad idea since SGPIO is a) a protocol that can be used by many 
different SATA controllers and is not nvidia specific and b) can also
be used by SAS.
