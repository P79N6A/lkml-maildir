Wrong answer. How do you intend to install Linux when a distro boot
kernel is compiled for lowest-common-denominator (386), and is the
'wrong' kernel for an Athlon ?
We hashed this argument out a week or so ago, it seems the message
didn't get across. YOU CAN NOT DISABLE ERRATA WORKAROUNDS IN A KERNEL
THAT MAY POSSIBLY BOOT ON HARDWARE THAT WORKAROUND IS FOR.
clearer ?
