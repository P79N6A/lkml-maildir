Hi Nathan and Paul,
Ok. The E801 call is broken on some BIOSes. So, can't we have
an arrangement like this:
The docs for E801 mention that the max. that can be returned in
AX is 0x3c00.
So,
1> If the E801 call returns AX < 0x3c00, then the system has < 64M
RAM (or the BIOS is broken) and the standard 88h call should give
the memory size.
2> If E801 returns AX > 0x3c00, then the BIOS is definitely broken
and again the standard 88h call should give the correct memory
size.
In short, if AX!=0x3c00 after executing E801, then the standard
call can be used.
I guess this can be a good workaround and can give nearly 100%
results.
Prashant
