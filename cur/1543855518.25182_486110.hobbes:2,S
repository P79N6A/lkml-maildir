This makes /dev/input/js32-63 take over /dev/input/mouse0-31 which is
contrary to what Documentation/devices.txt says and therefore not a good
idea for the mainline.
I am planning to convert input core to cdevs and that table will go away
completely and then it can be discussed how to extend range of input
devices (probably by going beyond 256 minors?).
