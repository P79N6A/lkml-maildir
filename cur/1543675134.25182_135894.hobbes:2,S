Short answer: Not in Linux 2.5.70.
Long answer: Some folks in the LTC are designing an error-log analysis (ELA)
system that will have access to sysfs as well as the event stream coming out
of the kernel.  Once the network interface is registered with sysfs -- in
v2.5.70, it's via netdev_register_sysfs, as called from register_netdevice --
you can find the net_device's info in sysfs based on the interface name.
The aforementioned ELA system could then annotate the event record with the
desired additional data out of sysfs (including driver name and bus ID).
Before the net_device is registered (at least), you'd presumably want to log
the driver name and bus ID.  One obvious way to do this is to have the probe
function call dev_* macros instead of netdev_* until register_netdev runs.
Another way could be via netdev_*, if we made netdev_* smart enough to log
the driver name and bus ID if netdev->class_dev.class isn't set yet.
There's clearly a difference of opinion among various developers as to whether
logging the interface name alone is sufficient.  Either way, I think it's a
win to have the net_device's pointer (as opposed to its name, if you're lucky)
handy when logging info about the net device; and to have the message format
live in one spot (netdevice.h) rather than all over drivers/net.

Was the name slippage due to the intervention of an administrative utility?
Just curious.
Thanks.
