yep. No desc->irq_handler. That should be 'impossible' on x86_64, 
because the irq_desc[] array is initialized with handle_bad_irq, and 
from that point on x86_64 only uses set_irq_chip_and_handler(), which at 
most can set it to another (non-NULL) handle_irq function. Weird.
does MSI much with the irq_desc[] separately perhaps, clearing 
handle_irq in the process perhaps?
