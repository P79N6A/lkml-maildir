It has puzzled me for a while why it doesn't occur to people that a high 
quality OTP is a high quality source of shared private keys for a good 
symmetric algorithm.  That is a much better use than 1-to-1 XOR.  Sure, 
you're still only as secure as the symmetric algorithm but if you can 
manage distribution of a OTP, you don't have to otherwise worry about 
key management other than walking through the keys so that they are only 
used once.  128MB+ (or 200MB or 1GB)  represents a lot of AES keys.  
With that many, you could just skip around on a non-key aligned random 
point (using your high-quality random source of course ;-) ), transmit 
the point you are using as a key selector, and not worry about avoiding 
reuse management.
PKI is better for many reasons, but it's still interesting that an 
essentially low-tech technique like OTP could be used in a similar way.  
You still have an N^2 key exchange problem that PKI solves.
