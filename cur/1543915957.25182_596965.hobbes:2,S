I agree in principal with the idea, but there are some major
practical wrinkles that would have to be worked through.
First, not all printks that are missing a log level should have one.
People do stuff like this:
printk(KERN_INFO "interesting info follows:");
...
printk("var5: %d\n", var5);
Or even things that evaluate to:
printk("");
The code inside printk currently has to examine the
strings, looking for line feeds and inserting log levels.
Given that there are about 60,000 printks in the kernel (and that's
not counting wrappers like dprintk() and other locally-defined
functions and macros) it would be a huge task to examine the code
and differentiate strings that really start a new log message
(and thus should have an attached log level) and strings
that don't.
