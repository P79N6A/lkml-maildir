In that case, I'd check your log to see what messages are getting
added to syslog when it happens, and see if there's any clues there.

All it needs is for cron to run a job that does something that makes
heavy use of the CPU - remember, it's not the program that starts the
rogue that causes the problems, but the rogue itself, and the rogue
doesn't care how it gets run.
