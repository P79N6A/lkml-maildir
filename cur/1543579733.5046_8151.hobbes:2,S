I think we're on to something.  I did gen's of the kernel with
the following configs: 1) 2.2.17 (w/apm), 2) 2.4(w/apm), 3) 2.4(w/o apm).
The apm seems to be a red herring in terms of actual performance
hit.  It seems to count apm time as 'system' time instead of 'idle'.
Kernel gen times were:
1) real    6m33.046s, user    6m1.380s, sys     0m18.450s
2)         6m45s real         6m12s user        0m26s sys  
3) real    6m49.275s, user    6m14.740s, sys    0m26.690s
The REAL problem was in disk performance.  The apm made no difference:
hdparm -t /dev/hda1 /dev/hda3 /dev/hda4 /dev/hda5 /dev/hda7
1) 2.2.17
/dev/hda1: Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  4.76 seconds = 13.45 MB/sec
/dev/hda3: Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  4.57 seconds = 14.00 MB/sec
/dev/hda4: Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  6.47 seconds =  9.89 MB/sec
/dev/hda5: Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  5.08 seconds = 12.60 MB/sec
/dev/hda7: Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  5.10 seconds = 12.55 MB/sec
2) 2.4 w/apm
/dev/hda1: Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 16.03 seconds =  3.99 MB/sec
/dev/hda3: Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 15.87 seconds =  4.03 MB/sec
/dev/hda4: Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 15.67 seconds =  4.08 MB/sec
/dev/hda5: Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 15.82 seconds =  4.05 MB/sec
/dev/hda7: Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 15.85 seconds =  4.04 MB/sec
3) 2.4 w/o apm
/dev/hda1: Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 16.02 seconds =  4.00 MB/sec
/dev/hda3: Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 15.88 seconds =  4.03 MB/sec
/dev/hda4: Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 15.67 seconds =  4.08 MB/sec
/dev/hda5: Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 15.85 seconds =  4.04 MB/sec
/dev/hda7: Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 15.86 seconds =  4.04 MB/sec   
Mine is on a ide1 device on a Dell Insp. 7500:
