Last I heard, pagetable sharing wasn't working out too well
because they all get unshared.

It's doubtful if per-arch would be an option.
How about this?
- We rely on large pages to solve the Oracle problem
- I'll do pte_chain_highmem and keep that and Bill's patch under test
  in my tree on a wait-and-see basis.  Could go ahead and submit it
  but it's all more complexity, and it'd be nice to actually pull
  something out for a change.
- We'll continue to suck for the University workload.
