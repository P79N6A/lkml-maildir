You also care about the L2 cache line and the amount of data that has
to be bounced across CPU's. There are specific algorithms for minimising
this kind of thing when solving many classic problem types like finite
element work. Even on a PII it is expensive to bounce data between CPUs.
You can reference the same data read-only on multiple CPU's relatively
cheaply, but a writer and one or more other reads costs. Multiple
writers costs a lot.
