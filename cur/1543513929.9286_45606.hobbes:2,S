Note: i did not even take a look.
But please consider porting rio fs into midnight commander. (Yes, you
heard me right). Create some ioctls() from parport driver so that you
can do everything, then do it fully userspace.
It should be less pain, and with podfuk
(
http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~pavel/podfuk/podfuk.html
) you'll
even be able to mount it. (And yes, next month you'll probably be able
to mount it read/write. Wow.)
