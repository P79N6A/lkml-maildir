How about a hypothetical time-based event daemon.  I want to run
some jobs every 10 minutes that the system is running (not off or
suspended), I want to run other jobs every hour in real time, and
if one such timer expires while suspended, I want to run it
immediately to catch up.  The first suggests CLOCK_MONOTONIC, and
the second works better with CLOCK_REALTIME.

I thought that's what he said, but maybe I'm just confused :-D.
