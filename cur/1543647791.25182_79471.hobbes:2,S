Well, sort of. I actually found someone who had one. Booted up 2.5.42. 
Everything seems to work except agpgart:
agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 439M
agpgart: Unsupported Via chipset (device id: 3189), you might want to try 
agp_try_unsupported=1.
agpgart: no supported devices found.
Is there a patch for 2.4? In one of the pre's?
thanks
jay
