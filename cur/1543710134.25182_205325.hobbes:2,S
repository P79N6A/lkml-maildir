The problem that is being addressed here is the need to avoid process
switching when sending IPMI messages over the SMBus/I2C bus. When the
kernel has panic'ed or is shutting down bus transactions need to
complete so the i2c bus drivers need to spin rather than calling
schedule. 
The i2c_spin_delay is a flag that supports a revised inline function
i2c_delay() that was in i2c.h at one time.
static inline void i2c_delay(signed long timeout)
 {
	if( i2c_spin_delay ) {
		int i;
		for( i=0 ; i<100 ; i++ )
			udelay(timeout*(1000000/HZ/100));
	} else {
		set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
		schedule_timeout(timeout);
	}
 }
Without this change i2c bus drivers will hang panic threads and short
circuit (fail) bus transactions during shutdown due to a pending signal.
I don't care how the exports are handled. It is the functionality that
is important here.

I think the point is that lower-level drivers need to use this variable 
(because of its use in the include file), but it's better to set it with
a function from external code.
Todd, am I correct here?
