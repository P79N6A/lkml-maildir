100% isn't good. F.ex. emu10k1 cards would lead to more bugreports since
you get clipping with that volume.

Which is stupid, since you need it zero before it can get to userspace.
(see the examples) And i know windows users who hates windows
soundcontrol since it plays a lame sound at boot up and you can't lower
the volume there (yes, easy workaround, but the same thing).
But, imho:
	PCM should not be 0, Setting main volume to 0 is good, but 	seeing the
common user getting there might be a problem.
Imagine:
Joe User installs Joe-Distro and starts xmms, now, with the default
config you change the 'master' volume but pcm is still 0. This is
something that will/could/might/etc cause reports like that.
Problem is, emu10k1 is good somewhere on the lines of 90% when it comes
to pcm... I dunno if other cards has simular issues.
Change PCM (and simular) if anything, changing master will only cause
problems, as seen.
CC, since I'm not on this ml.
