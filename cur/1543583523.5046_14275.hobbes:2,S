However, I think you've hit the nail on the head here; much of tux is
just general-purpose network file-blasting.  The right hacker could turn
it into the fastest web-cache on the planet with the right modules.  I
believe Ingo already did a basic ftp server based on tux, just to
demonstrate this generality.
Ingo?  Am I crazy or enlightened?
