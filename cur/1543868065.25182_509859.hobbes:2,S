Oops, I was not aware of this. I had a look at your patch and yes, it's a 
nice
and generic interface. I concur that using your generic function is the 
better
approach.

The intention of adding the location code was to include a device property
into the environment that's unique to each device. Actually, the DEVPATH 
variable
provides exactly this: For ebus devices, it points to the ebus device 
itself,
which natually is unique.
If a userspace tool really needs the location code, the "devspec" 
attribute of
the ebus device will point it to the device tree node, which in turn 
contains the
location code property.
So I think there's nothing preventing me from using your function. Thanks 
for
pointing this out.
Regards,
  Joachim
