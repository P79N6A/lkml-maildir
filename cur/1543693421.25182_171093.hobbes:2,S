It went more like
	- it was determined that the same thing could be done in
	  userspace
	- devfs had been shoved into the tree in hope that its quality will
	  catch up
	- devfs was found to have fixable and unfixable bugs
	- the former had stayed around for many months with maintainer claiming
	  that everything works fine
	- the latter had stayed, period.
	- the devfs maintainer/author disappeared and stoped maintaining
	  the code.
