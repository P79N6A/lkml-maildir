...Only if it were under some DEBUG option. Even if iperf is doing
the wrong thing there is no explanation for such big difference in
the behavior between sched_compat_yield 1 vs. 0. It seems common
interfaces should work similarly and predictably on various
systems, and here, if I didn't miss something, linux looks like a
different kind?
