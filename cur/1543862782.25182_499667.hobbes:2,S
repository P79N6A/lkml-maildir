Hi Christophe:
I'm wondering about trying out your patch with dm-crypt on 2.6.12. 
The code in drivers/md/dm-crypt.c`crypt_endio() appears to be the same.
Is there a reason that this isn't necessary or would be a bad idea.
Looks like the existing code isn't checking the BIO_UPTODATE flag
before doing the bio_put(). Looks the the second part of not calling
kcryptd_queue_io() and forwarding the processing to the cryptd is
effectively the same. The 1st change will set error if BIO_UPTODATE
isn't set and that will cause the 2nd change to skip calling 
kcryptd_queue_io().
I'm not sure about the change in the arg to bio_data_dir() 
changing from bio to io->bio. Perhaps they are equivalent;
care to comment on that.
Unless I hear otherwise I'll try it out Tomorrow.
