I meant that as an example, I recall that was valid config, 512M of ram
and 512M hole, then next node 512M ram and 512M hole etc... Of course it
must be possible to vary the mem size if you want more or less ram in
each node but still it doesn't generate a problematic layout for
discontigmem (i.e. not 256 discontigous chunks or something of that
order).
