Your patch fixed the freeze. Tested with kernel 2.6.14.
I should have mentioned, that my system is equiped with a 
Fujitsu-Siemens Mainboard D1562-A2, most recent BIOS V4.06 R1.09.
I'll try to get this bug fixed in the BIOS, but chances are not that 
good as the board is already "quite old".
Would you please be so kind and drop a few lines about the drawbacks of 
this BIOS bug? What kind of functionality is lost by "ignoring" the 
second CPU at this particular code section?
Thanks for your support!
Bye.
