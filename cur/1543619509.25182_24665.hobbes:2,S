I'm not sure whether the Coda part of this patch is correct. Coda does
rely in the inode semaphore to protect from concurrency between the
userspace cachemanager that accesses the file on the host filesystem
directly and the applications that access the same file through the
/coda mount.
See for instance coda_file_write, where we also use the host inode
semaphore for protection. Only sys_stat() accesses i_size unprotected,
but that doesn't matter much in my opinion. Any application relying on
the result of sys_stat to do appending or subsequent lseeks would be
racy anyways. (and it can only be fixed correctly when we get a FS
specific getattr method).

So in my opinion, if your patch got applied, the Coda part needs to be
reverted.
