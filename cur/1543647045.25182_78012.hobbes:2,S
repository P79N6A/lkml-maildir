Me too :-( I just got the same oops while rebooting a server which had
done a trial run with 2.5.41. None of my other boxes has had this oops
yet, but the only unique features of the server are that (a) it has two
NICs, and (b) the disks are connected to an add-on PDC20267 card and
I'm using the PDC202XX_OLD driver for it -- PIIX is also enabled but
it only handles the CD-ROM.
