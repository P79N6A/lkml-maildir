Note that this part of the status page really is worth some attention.
Alan doesn't have the time to maintain 2.4.x issues. Which means that
right nobody is really doing it. I have a kind of general "map" in my
head, but that isn't nearly good enough..
Would somebody be interested in taking this over?
Note! It's more than just maintaining a list. It's realizing what are
show-stoppers, and what are just problems that should be fixed. It's
trying to work with people in trying to get enough information to get a
good list of problems, but it's also trying to confirm that the problem
still exists or is fixed.
It's also possibly maintaining potential fixes: keeping track of who has
suggested what fix (possibly with an actual patch). Sometimes the fixes
aren't actually usable as-is due to other issues, but even when they are
not usable they can be supremely important for people who try to fix the
same thing in a acceptable manner.
It's also good if you're respected by people already, or at least think
you can work with people without making them hate you.
In short: it's important.  And it's something that Alan did for both 2.0
and 2.2.  Nobody can quite live up to "being Alan", but hey, if you
don't like long beards you may be just as heppy knowing that. 
Anybody?
