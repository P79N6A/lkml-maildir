Dear Friend.
My name is Mr. Robert Jonathan. I 
am the Eastern region branch manager
of the Natwest Bank Plc,of London 
United Kingdom. I do not want 
problemsbut I just hope you can assist 
me. I write you this letter in good faith.
I am in control of the sum 
of Six Million Five Hundred Thousand Pounds sterling(6.5 Million 
Pounds)which was an excess of profit made by our Eastern region branch 
office 
in the  last quarter of the year 2003,which I have carefully 
placed in 
an  Escrow Call Deposit Account and did not declare this to 
my head 
office, Can I really trust you to hold this money for me until 
I arrive 
your country and pick it up myself and you deduct 30% of the 
total 
money as your commission?
All I need is for you to get me a 
good current account in your bank
where I can move this money,I will 
discreetly give you all the 
information concerning the account and the 
deposit so that  you can 
apply to the Bank for the release of the 
money. 
There is  practically no risk involved; it will be simple 
Bank-to-Bank transfer. I hope you understand my situation.Take my 
word.
Thank you and God bless.
