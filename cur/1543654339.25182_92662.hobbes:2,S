Subject: how to list pci devices from userpace?  anything better than /proc/bus/pci/devices?

I have a situation where the userspace app needs to be able to deal with 
  two different models of hardware, each of which uses a slightly 
different api.
Is there any way that I can query the pci vendor/device numbers without 
having to parse ascii files in /proc?
Thanks,
Chris
