Who the heck added these unhelpful
"ipt_hook: happy cracking."
messages to iptables/mangling/connection tracking code? There are three
instances.
If the kernel has got something to say, it should be clear what the
kernel means, say, maximum <whatever> rate exceeded or something, not
such junk like this.
This is IMHO a MUST-FIX before 2.6.0.
