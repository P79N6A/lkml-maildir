In general, the patches look reasonable to me.  Just an observation:

The attribute names (DMA_ATTR_...) are going to have to live somewhere
outside of the #ifdef ARCH_USES_DMA_ATTRS otherwise we'll get compile
failures of drivers using attributes on architectures that don't support
them.
Secondly, DMA_ATTR_BARRIER doesn't quite sound right.  What you're
actually doing is trying to prescribe strict ordering, so shouldn't this
be something like DMA_ATTR_STRICT_ORDERING (and perhaps with a
corresponding DMA_ATTR_RELAXED_ORDERING for the PCIe case).  also,
strike the DMA_ATTR_FOO and DMA_ATTR_GOO since they have no plausible
meaning.
