I disagree. Reporting an error code is precisely the case where I think
(%d) is valuable. A colon suggests that an understandable explanation
follows, while an error code isn't that understandable. What I expect
as a user is:
	Read failed: I/O error
but:
	Read failed (-5)
And I thought this was the usual convention, too, but you seem to
disagree.

Agreed.

Agreed.

I'm fine both ways.

I would be fine having one or more explicit rules in CodingStyle on how
log messages should be formatted, if you think it adds value. But a
general statement "don't do foo" when it's sometimes just fine to do
foo, doesn't add any value IMHO.
