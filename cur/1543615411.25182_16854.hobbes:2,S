Quite honestly if you want a user built "update" kernel it should probably
work out the critical stuff (CPU, memory size limit, SMP) set a few things
to safe values, and build all the driver modules.
Why ask the user at all. The boot process already knows what modules to load
Instead you get
	Checking...
		This is an X86 platform
		You have an AMD K6 processor
		Your machine lacks SMP support
		You have 256Mb of memory
	I am building you a kernel for an AMD K6 series processor with
	up to 1Gb of memory and no SMP. If you add more than 1Gb of memory
	you will need to build a new kernel
