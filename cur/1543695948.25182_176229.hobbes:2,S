I'm sorry for the late follow up as I lost Internet connection during the
period of OS reinstallation. The following symptom I have newly noticed
is a follow up to my first post in this thread.
As reported in my first message, the box running kernel 2.4.22 and
Fjuitsu HD generated i8253 message while the other box running 2.4.20 and
Maxtor did not. During the past 3 days I wiped out everything from the HD
and reinstalled Debian woody on to the "normal" box (with Maxtor) and
rebuilt the kernel to 2.4.22. This used-to-be normal box started to
generate the i8253 message since then.
Then I downgraded both boxes to kernel 2.4.20. Now both boxes are running
woody and kernel 2.4.20 on identical hardware exept HD's and RAM's. Well,
both boxes completely stop the i8253 message since the OS downgrade :). I
don't have any knowledge regarding the technical details but I think
reporting this "history" to this list should be a good idea.
Best Regards,
CN
