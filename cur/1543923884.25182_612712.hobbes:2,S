Hi,
Commit: b9dca1e0fcb696716840a3bc8f20a6941b484dbf
seems to me that by calling enqueue_fair_task() from task_new_fair() is
wrong. The wakeup=1 in enqueue_fair_task() will cause all non-top
sched_entities to be re-positioned by place_entity().
Although the current implementation thereof seems to avoid doing
something horrible.
