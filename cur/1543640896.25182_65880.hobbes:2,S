NO, I just misreferenced you because you was asked to help in a situation
with G Britton, as you have refreshed my memory with a hammer.
So I apologize for mixing events and people.
The point still stands, there are case where the OS is launched,
regardless of bootloading, where devices can be lost if the time limits
are not followed.  In the case where my memory failed, you reminded me the
device took 40 secs to spinup.
Not dead wrong just dead tired again.
