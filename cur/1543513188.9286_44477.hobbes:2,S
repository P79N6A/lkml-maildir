I have done a bit more experimenting and I have discovered that only
somethings cause this.  mpg123 and timidity cause the timeout message.  the
sox play script doesn't cause this.  cat blah.wav > /dev/dsp causes the
message while cat blah.wav > /dev/audio doesn't.
        Does this have anything to do with the "Blocking vs. nonblocking IO"
differences.  It does mention the timidity problem.
