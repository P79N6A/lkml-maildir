A wait_queue is where a task goes while waiting for some event. If you
want to share it among modules you first need to determine where the
wait queue would be declared.  If module A and module B use the same
wait queue, and module A has declared it. Then module B would be
dependent on module A.  Module A would also have to export the wait
queue via the EXPORT_SYMBOL macro.  Or, the wait queue can be declared
in the kernel itself and all modules can use it. 
As for a practical implementation for doing this, I'm not sure what you
are asking for since the question itself is quite abstract.  I haven't
needed to export a wait queue from one module to the next. The best I
can tell you is if one module supplies some functionality or driver for
some device that has a wait queue for some event, and another module
adds functionality or a sub system of the device that needs to have
tasks wait on the same event, then I guess that would be one case.
