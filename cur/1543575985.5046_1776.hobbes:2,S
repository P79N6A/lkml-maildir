I got the following errors compiling the kernel 2.4.0-test12
mga_dma.c: In function `mga_irq_install':
mga_dma.c:821: structure has no member named `next'
make[3]: *** [mga_dma.o] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory `/u2/src/linux-2.4.0/drivers/char/drm'
i810_dma.c: In function `i810_irq_install':
i810_dma.c:927: structure has no member named `next'
make[3]: *** [i810_dma.o] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory `/u2/src/linux-2.4.0/drivers/char/drm'
commented out the following in i810_dma.c and mga_dma.c to make it work ...
//dev->tq.next        = NULL;
Don't know enough as to whether this is sufficent. Need advice.
Thanks,
Jeff
