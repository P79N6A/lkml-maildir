It's getting time I learned what this freezer thing is.
What would you suggest I read?
I looked in include/linux/freezer.h and didn't see any explanations.
I found one Documenation file, power/kernel_threads.txt, that explained
the interaction of freezing and kernel threads.  I looked in the
comments for various 2.6.21-rc6-mm1 freezer* patches, and saw various
interesting details.
But I couldn't find any documentation telling me what a freezer was,
or what a refrigerator is.
Did I miss something?
