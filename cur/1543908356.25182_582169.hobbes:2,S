Not yet, but if you give Ingo what he wants (as opposed to what you're
giving him) it'll be easier for him to answer what's going wrong, and
perhaps "fix" the problem to boot.
(The scripts gives info about CPU characteristics, interrupts,
modules, etc. -- you know, all those "unknown" variables.)
And perhaps a patch to show what parts you commented out, too, so one
can tell if anything got broken (unintentionally).
