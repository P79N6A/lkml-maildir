Hi all,
the stock 2.5.70 dies early upon boot on my alpha UP2000
( dual EV67, DP264 vector ). It happens, after the kernel
tries to start the second CPU. The error happens regardless
of the compilers i tried ( gcc 3.2.3 and 2.95.4 ).
Unfortunately, I do not have a log handy. If that is crucial,
I can rewire my serial console and capture one.
Any Ideas ?
