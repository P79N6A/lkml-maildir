Don't know what kernel you're looking at, but 2.6.15rc5 has
 *      bit 0 == 0 means no page found, 1 means protection fault
 *      bit 1 == 0 means read, 1 means write
 *      bit 2 == 0 means kernel, 1 means user-mode
 *      bit 3 == 1 means use of reserved bit detected
 *      bit 4 == 1 means fault was an instruction fetch
