Side note: I should probably have made this the standard notation for the 
"for_each_xxx ()" macros, because having an "end_xxx" macro means that you 
can start using things like "do { ... } while (x)" loops for the control 
flow, which is often easier for the compiler to optimize (ie if the first 
element is always valid, and you don't need a condition going in, which is 
often true).
It does, of course, end up polluting the name-space a bit more.
