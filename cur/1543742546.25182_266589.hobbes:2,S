Yes, that bit me with CF card reader too. AFAICS The Right Solution is
to create /dev/ub -devices and use them.
Following worked for me:
- -
mknod /dev/uba b 125 0
mknod /dev/uba1 b 125 1
mknod /dev/uba2 b 125 2
mknod /dev/ubb b 125 8
mknod /dev/ubb1 b 125 9
mknod /dev/ubb2 b 125 10
mknod /dev/ubc b 125 16
mknod /dev/ubc1 b 125 17
mknod /dev/ubc2 b 125 18
- -
/dev/sda1 becomes /dev/uba1 etc.
There is a notion that 125 -major number will be going away?:
