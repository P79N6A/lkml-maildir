At least, in May 2005, the equivalent of this patch I tested on
2.6.11.7 considerably improved responsiveness, but there was still
this very annoying slowdown when the load increased. vmstat delays
increased by one second every 10 processes. I retried again around
2.6.14 a few months ago, and it was the same. Perhaps Mike's code
and other changes in 2.6-mm really fix the initial problem (array
switching ?) and then only the interactivity boost is causing the
remaining trouble ?
Cheers,
Willy
