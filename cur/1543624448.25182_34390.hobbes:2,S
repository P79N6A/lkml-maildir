Yep, I expected that, but wouldn't this only be packets which had
*already* entered the RX buffer? These packets are being transmitted at
a rate of one every .1/.2 seconds, so I guess it's unlikely that all
these packets have entered the RX buffer and been zapped. OTOH - I'm
just stabbing away wildly in the dark so I most likely wrong ;)

I'm not getting the Pause enabled message *at all*. The other host is
100Mbit (I've not got another gigabit host to test against yet).
If I stop doing the ping I notice that I loose TCP/IP connectivity for a
while, but it usually comes back after a period of time (sorry to be so
vague, but I haven't been able to tell how long it takes to come back
exactly).
Interestingly, whilst writing this e-mail, I've been running a ping with
a 1 second interval and no options (so we end up with 84 bytes in the
packet). It did the same thing, but took a lot longer than 14 packets to
recover... (FYI: 195.195.14.1 is across an ADSL link from me -
explaining the high rtt :) )

So I had another brainstorm, perhaps this is related to the amount of
data transfer /rather/ than packets.
If I do ping -i .1 10.0.0.15 (i.e. an 84 byte packet), I get the
following very interesting results.
64 bytes from 10.0.0.15: icmp_seq=298 ttl=255 time=0.223 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.0.15: icmp_seq=299 ttl=255 time=0.209 ms

64 bytes from 10.0.0.15: icmp_seq=633 ttl=255 time=0.201 ms
i.e. it takes the card 325 packets to recover, yet with 1500 byte
packets... I get, 
1480 bytes from 10.0.0.15: icmp_seq=499 ttl=255 time=0.558 ms

1480 bytes from 10.0.0.15: icmp_seq=522 ttl=255 time=0.548 ms
14 packets missing.
325*84  = 27300
14*1500 = 21000
Are these number relevant?
