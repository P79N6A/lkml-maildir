I think we all know that winmodems suck.  That really shouldn't be the
point here.  If somebody is willing to do the work and can legally release
the source for his work I see no reason why we should as a community
prevent him from doing so just to maintain some sort of moral high ground
argument about crappy hardware.  This sort of driver should not be
included in the main kernel source most likely just because it probably
would require some negative changes to accomidate it, but thats still no
reason why we should discourage somebody from giving it a try.  Winmodems
don't work right, encourage people to buy real ones (I certainly do), but
linux is about getting work done right?  If somebody still buys one of
those things why should linux turn up its nose arbitrarily?  Your
arguments about winmodems are not going to impress people evaluating linux
when they see their hardware is not supported (esp. for silly reasons).
