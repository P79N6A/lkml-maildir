Subject: [PATCH] 32-bit UID support for 2.3.27
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi. I have updated and tested the 32-bit UID support patches further. A
new version is available at:
http://www.engin.umich.edu/caen/systems/Linux/code/misc/2.3/19991111/
Changes in this version:
	- updated to final 2.3.27 kernel
	- fix alignment bug in process accounting record (struct acct)
	  (thanks to Albert D. Cahalan)
	- fix 3 typos in the prototype SysVIPC patch, and make 1 minor
	  cleanup- the patch is now even simpler
	- prototype SysVIPC patch is no longer a prototype; it is tested
	  and verified to work (backwards compatibility at least)
	- all extraneous blank lines, useless comments in patches removed to
	  make them as small and simple as possible
The patches are tested and working on 2.3.27pre6. A patch for glibc to
actually take advantage of 32-bit UIDs with these patches can be found at:
http://www.engin.umich.edu/caen/systems/Linux/code/misc/2.3/19991111/glibc-2.1.1-highuid.patch
(the previous version of the patch for glibc improperly used padding space
in the stat structure, as pointed out by Ulrich Drepper)
Beware that a patched glibc will not work with an unpatched kernel.
Thanks,
Chris Wing
