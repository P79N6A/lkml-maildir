What do you mean "parametrized by the arch Kconfig files"? Does this
mean that it would still be in the global files, but would be enabled by
some kind of switch or preprocessor macro in the arch dependant file? If
easily doable, this would IMHO be preferable.
However, if not easily feasible, I'm also ok with duplication.

Thanks, that would be nice.

Ok
