Just a word of warning: The wording above fails to make it clear what
the second clause is applying to. Additionally it has the following
restrictions that are probably not intended:
   1) Does not specifically allow this firware to be sold as part of an
      aggregate
   2) The range of modifications allowed is rather vague, and implies
      that the firmware can't be extracted
I'd instead suggest applying a pre-existing license like MIT[1] to the
firmware portion of the code file, rather than inventing your own
licensing text that only partially deals with the problem(s) at issue.
(Inventing licensing text is quite often very hazardous to your
health.)
