Thats what glibc does. Ulrich confirmed that. I would say thats not a bad 
optimization on glibc's part as it does not really make sense to zero out 
a memory again in user space if we know for sure that new heap memory that 
kernel hands over to us will be zeroed. I'm not sure though whether this 
is a documented kernel ABI.

I understand that for a desktop/server running Linux but not for an 
embedded box where all the applications that run on the box is controlled 
by you.
Thanx,
