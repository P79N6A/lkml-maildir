You are right. I missed the place in check_pcibios where you remove the
PCI_PROBE_CONF{1,2}-flags from pci_probe :( My bad. If you would like
to hand off the documentation patch, I'll take another stab (based on
my new insight :) )
> Anyway, have you already tried "pci=conf1" as I've suggested in my previous mail?
Yes. It worked/works very nice. Thanks.
