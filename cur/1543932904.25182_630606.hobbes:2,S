Subject: [PATCH 0/15] adjust pvops to accomodate its x86_64 variant

Hi folks,
With this series, the bulk of the work of pvops64 is done.
Here, I integrate most of the paravirt.c and paravirt.h files, making
them applicable to both architectures.
CONFIG_PARAVIRT is _not_ present yet. Basically, this code is missing page
table integration (patches currently being worked on by Jeremy).
Enjoy
