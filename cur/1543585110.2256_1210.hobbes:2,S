It's not convenient, but it is certainly possible: use a
single-partition raid0 logical device with raid autostart, and you get
a logical /dev/md* device which corresponds to a single partition and
which has a fixed name which is detected by the kernel at runtime and
mapped to the correct disk, wherever the disk may be.
The IBM EVMS folks are looking to generalise this sort of probing, but
for now there is at least one solution to this problem.  LVM works too
to some extent, but it currently lacks the automatic boot-time/
device-detect-time kernel probing step that the software raid code
has.
Cheers,
 Stephen
