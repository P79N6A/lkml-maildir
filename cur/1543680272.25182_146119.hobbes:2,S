It's not cool. Pentium Classic tuning is quite useless for PPro+
The Pentium Classic had a quite weird pipeline and code optimized
for it tends to be suboptimal for more modern designs.
I didn't benchmark, but I suspect the C version compiled with a good compiler
for the correct CPU is faster than that on a modern CPU.
