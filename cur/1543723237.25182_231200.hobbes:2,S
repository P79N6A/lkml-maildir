I was able to dd ~140 GB with SATA_SIL today, on a stock bk kernel, till
I ran out of disk, no errors. which was a pleasant unexpected surprise.
but when I checked "Timing buffered disk reads" it was around 25 MB/sec
not the ~52 MB/sec I saw before with the oops. The odd thing was this
disk was not in the blacklist so I don't know why it was running slower.
