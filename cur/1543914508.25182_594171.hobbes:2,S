He wasn't changing that part of the option.  I'm fairly certain that
description has been there for years.  If you want to change it to be
a bit more "fair", feel free.

I wasn't picking a vendor.  I was pointing out a well laid out webpage
that describes what CFI is and provides the spec for it.  If you want
to link directly to jedec, ok.
And no, I don't work at Intel, own stock in it, or know of them giving
out free hardware on a regular basis.  I do happen to like what Intel
is doing in regards to opening their drivers, but that has nothing to
do with this :).
