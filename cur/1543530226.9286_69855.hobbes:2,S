there is a simple solution.  Reorganise the Documentation directory so
that all README files are placed in there and are easily findable.  i propose
that they are organised in the same way as the source, eg:
linux/Documentation/drivers/scsi
linux/Documentation/arch/arm
linux/Documentation/net/
It doesn't need to be as deep as the source tree is, only as far as makes
sense.  i had a script to do this which i can unearth if anyone's interested.
