Or use the following:

I find it perfectly idiotic to tell people to use older kernel
include. Better to tell them to use stable versions if they do
not know what they do.
I want applications to be build with the new kernel headers,
including new API, especially when some aren't backward
compatible, and I think I'm not alone. And the only way to find
these is to symlink those headers to the utilised kernel release.
