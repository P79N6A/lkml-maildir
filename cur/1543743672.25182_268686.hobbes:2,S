Is your system SMP ? I'm actively tracking a problem now with
pass-thru behaviour (via /dev/sg* ) on SMP systems.
Symptom is a system freeze after a few messages like
this:
ata3: command 0x34 timeout, stat 0x58 host_stat 0x0
ata2: command 0x24 timeout, stat 0x58 host_stat 0x0
ata3: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete <4>ATA: abnormal status 0x58 on port 0xF8A3CCC7
ata2: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
DataReq
This particular example is of a Read Sectors command pending
on one drive and Write Sectors on another. Don't know if it
is the pio state machine not being SMP-safe, or what just yet.
