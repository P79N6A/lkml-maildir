Dear all,
I created some directories below /proc while a module got installed.
When I de-install the module, I would like to remove these directories as
well?
First, I remove the entries within the directory by remove_proc_entry().
So, the directories are empty.  But when I try to remove the self-created
directories with a similar call to remove_proc_entry(), nothing happens.
So, I simply ask: is there somewhere a proc_rmdir() ?  If not, how do I
need to call the remove_proc_entry() such that the directory gets removed?
Thanks for any help!
Lukas
