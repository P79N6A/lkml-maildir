Thank you Eric, for such a clear explanation of the problem (I have 
one of those drives and was the one who made the second report I 
believe...  Now it seems that a fix can be written into our driver 
without a lot of fuss, so it becomes a non-issue for us once thats 
filtered thru Andrew and on up to Linus.
My Q for you, is, does M$ already have a similar workaround in their 
drivers?  Just curious. :)
