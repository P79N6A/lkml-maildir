Nope, think about the system a bit more. It isn't so stupid.
if(setuid){
  if(root_owned && cap_header) use_cap_header();
  else use_setuid_bit();

My system does not give full root privs.

Yep - that is what my system offers.

Use the setuid bit as normal, if it is not disabled. If you did disable
the setuid bit, you might still allow it via the header. If you disable
that too, then you obviously don't want a UID 0 executable.

Fill in headers that mean "normal UID with capabilities", then make
the executable setuid-root. It will NOT run as root.
> 3.  Make an executable that runs with UID 0 and capabilities.
Fill in headers that mean "UID 0 with capabilities", then make the
executable setuid-root.

The above _is_ "real capabilities". It can be more if desired:
euid =   (left as the user)
ruid =   (left as the user)
suid = sybase              
fsuid = mail 
extragroups = foo, bar, baz
P_priv = CAP_FOO, CAP_BAR, CAP_BAZ
E_priv = CAP_FOO, CAP_WHATEVER, CAP_XYZ
I_priv = CAP_FOO, CAP_USEFUL_THING, CAP_STUFF
In the above, I set two of the four UIDs (to different values),
added 3 extra groups, and changed capabilities.
