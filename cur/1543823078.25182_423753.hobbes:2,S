Your architecture is much like ours. Nowadays we are involing a
project named cluster_on_board, on which there are 4~16 cpus on a
board, these cpus can be the same and also can be different, and all
cpus can see all the memory. We are trying let each cpu running one
instance of kernel image(same or different), and communicate through
tcp/ip on a virtual Ethernet.  Of course, modifications are needed.
 I think you can do it in the same way. Or any more exciting ideas?
