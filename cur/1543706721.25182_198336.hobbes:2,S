Sorry, I "shortened" that line away and will add it again.

I still use 80 wide but with many more lines. I tend to be sloppy about 
code extending beyond 80, which I shall change ;)
Also bear in mind that the fundamental arguments for 80 columns are not 
related to (display) hardware capabilities, but related to clarity of code.

As to "five years ago", what about review the coding style situation before 
starting 2.7:
In view of better hardware, increasing linelength a little to 96 could be 
considered without increasing the number of indentation levels.
Perhaps consider deprecating function-like macros as inline technology
is much improved.
