Yes, those Windows games are anomalies that rely on the OS scheduling
them AS IF they were real-time, but without actually claiming that
priority.
Because these games just assume they own the whole system and aren't
explicitly telling the OS about their real-time requirements, the OS has
to guess instead and can get it wrong, especially when hardware
capabilities advance in ways that force changes to the task scheduler
(multi-core, hyper-threading).  And you said it yourself, many old games
don't work well on dual-core systems.
I think your effort to improve the guessing is a good idea, and
thanks.  
Just don't dismiss the idea that games do have real-time requirements
and if they did things correctly, games would explicitly specify those
requirements.
