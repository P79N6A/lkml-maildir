What is the "propability" that drivers using the interfaces now declared 
as "EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL" are derived from the Linux kernel source code 
instead of some definitive documentation?
As you all (should) know there is a book called "Linux Device Drivers, 
3rd Edition" published by O'Reilly (ISBN 0-596-00590-3)". All the USB 
kernel interfaces are documented there. One of the authors is Greg 
Kroah-Hartman which makes this book "definite" source of information on 
Linux USB driver programming. I assume Greg is the author of the USB 
related sections.
The "legal" question is what is that which one is license the one that 
applies? Is it the licecense of the kernel (GPL) or is it the license of 
the documentation (no restrictions on usage)?
The "moral" question is that why did Greg author a book that declares 
these USB interfaces as "free to use" and soon after that made a 
decision that they are no longer "free to use"?
Best regards,
Hannu
