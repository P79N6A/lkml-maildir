I agree with you. 
Do you mean to say that I have to issue MOD_INC_USE_COUNT
in the hard_start_xmit function also.
If Yes then I have a problem here also.
Consider that the hard_start_xmit function of my module is invoked, but the
MOD_INC_USE_COUNT is still not executed and at this point of time, rmmod 
command is issued to this driver. The cleanupmodule() will be invoked as 
the module is not in use.
After unloading, if the context switches back to the hard_start_xmit(), 
it will crash, as the function does not exist.
Please do give me a solution for this.
Thanks
