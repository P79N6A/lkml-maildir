I'd like a way to just close TCP connections which are misbehaving in 
some way, not necessarily due to bad intent. I envision some tool which 
would take either IP or IP+port and send an RST to both ends. Yes, I 
could write one, but I bet someone already has. I did something similar 
a few years ago, but the requestor owns the code.
