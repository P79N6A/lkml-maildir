Hairy is ok as long as it provides substantial benefit in some way, and
this does definitely not qualify.

Well as interesting as that is, it is still an obscurity that will not
be generally supported. As I said, if you wanted to do such a thing you
can do it in the driver. Complicating the block layer in this way is
totally unacceptable, and is just bound to be an endless source of data
corrupting driver bugs.

Ok fair enough, make that a strong "obviously wont" instead then.
