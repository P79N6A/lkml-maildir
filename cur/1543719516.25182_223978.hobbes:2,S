No this is different again. When there is significant load and an interactive
task (like X) is using bursts of cpu it will not get a chance to sleep. It will
either run out of timeslice or be preempted and thus will be constantly on the
runqueue. In that time if only sleep time is counted it is progressively seen
as a cpu bound task - in fact this was a major problem before where X would
basically die under load because you'd move a window and it would be constantly
waiting for more cpu time rather than ever sleeping.

I've already tried that experiment and I personally failed to make the pattern
of sleep/burst correspond with interactivity. There is a huge variation in the
duration of sleep/run for all different things, and it changes with load. Of
course your modelling may be better than mine.

Oooh I've got one of those too but I normally dont use it on lkml.
So just for this once...
