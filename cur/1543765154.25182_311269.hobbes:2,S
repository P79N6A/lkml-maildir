Yes, it is my intention in the future to add support for the needed
information,
probably at the /sys level.
The key is to be able to get at the tty information without
having to open up the tty/port.
Again, I understand why you required the changes in JSM,
IBM didn't need DPA support, so I had no problem with removing the
support.
However, neither IBM nor Digi wants this thread's patch to be applied,
and yet Christoph wants to do it, completely out of spite, to break our
out-of-tree open source driver.
This is the problem that I have.
Scott
