Yes it is, at least with newer (or rather not ancient) hardware...
From what I can see 2.4 does not have this problem because before
toucing the control register it tries to reset the keyboard and
stops if there is not response. I think this also menas that 2.4
does not support keyboard hot-plugging. In 2.6 we do not make any
assumptions on what kind of hardware attached to a port (KBD, mouse)
so reset test probably won't work...
I wonder if simply resetting controller (by passing i8042.reset)
would help in your case?
