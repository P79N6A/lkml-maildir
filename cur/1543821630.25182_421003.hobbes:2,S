My experience with such a stacking and reiserfs was horrible. Continous
filesystem corruption that finally required reformatting. I then
replaced reiserfs with ext3 and the stacking works since then.
It is not a dm-crypt problem as the symptoms also occurred with
raid5/lvm2/reiserfs, so any raidx/dm/reiserfs stacking seems to be only
something for the more adventurous folks. Thus I don't know if the
problem still exists with current kernels.
