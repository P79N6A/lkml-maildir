2.5.64 with Local APIC support enabled has already locked me out of my
system 3 times in less than 3 hours. Interestingly enough, it looks like
only the keyboard and the pcmcia slots are getting disabled, the power
led on the wavelan card turns off. A compile that was running just
continued on without a problem and the sysrq-unmount/sync/boot all
worked fine. So display and harddrive were fine.
Did not have any problem all morning when Local APIC support was not
enabled. Perhaps it can't be the problem because my cpu lacks the apic
in the first place, but it sure looks like it is related. I will run
without Local APIC support for a couple of hours now to make sure that
I wasn't just lucky this morning.
