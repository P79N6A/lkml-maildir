Making it a separate clock would be a bit more complex and I don't know if 
it's really worth it for an event that only happens every few years.
We already have everything we need to adjust CLOCK_REALTIME, so it would 
be not a real problem to support a timezone UTS.

That's the other possibility, as soon as we update the userspace interface 
to NTP4, it will also include the TAI value, so it will be available via 
adjtimex()/ntp_gettime().
