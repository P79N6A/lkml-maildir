Please inform yourself before posting.....
Burn-Proof is switched off by default and other protections (invented later)
are switched off by cdrecord to get compatibility..... if you only had read the 
man page......
Switching Burn-Proof on will reduce the quality of the CDs.
In addition: if you don't have the experience when Buffer Underruns occur, you 
should not post speculations that it is not a problem. I know that it _is_ and 
this should be enough for you. Unless you send me the results from a test done 
under worst conditions you need to believe in the experience of people who 
spend more time on CD/DVD recording issues than you.
Proving things to work for a 1/12th dozen only is not sufficient for granting 
quality.
