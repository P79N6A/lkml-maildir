Hello Jaswinder,

Currently the answer is no. (Unless overruled from userspace) I did
not take this requirement into account.
So, Is this a serious requirement? Should this be possible?
I cannot imagine a purpose in which that is wanted, it would cause
unpredictable interrupt handling, and I can imagine that many
drivers/devices will not like that.
The purpose is usually to spread the threads across several
priorities, to create room for some RT-process to become more
important than an IRQ that generates large latencies, and each
RT-system designer shall divide the priorities different, due to
different system requirements.
Kind Regards,
Remy
