Since Slackware 3.0 with kernel 1.2.13, I have NEVER ever used
"rdev" or any other hack.  I put my kernels in /boot, and they
have just worked.  I wasn't even aware what the purpose of rdev
was, or of any such concerns.  I've moved root partitions around
several times no problem on many machines and have never ever had
any trouble.  My kernels all get compiled on the machine that I'm
on, which root is /dev/hda6 now, but was previously /dev/hdb6.
The kernels are used on another box which it is /dev/hda1, and
the SAME kernel is used on yet another box on /dev/hdb1.  These
machines are all very different.
My lilo.conf is stock redhat on all machines, except for specific
changes:
1 root@asdf:/var/log# cat /etc/lilo.conf
boot=/dev/hda6
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=50
image=/boot/bzImage-2.2.11
        label=linux
        root=/dev/hda6
        read-only
        vga=extended
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.5-22
        label=linux-update
        root=/dev/hda6
        read-only
        vga=extended
If I have the machine configured with LILO on the MBR, then the
"root=" sections are changed to match the new root device.
If I have LILO on the root partition, and boot with a different
bootloader (System Commander), I change both "boot=", and "root="
to point to the new root fs.
Afterwards I run "lilo".  I've never ran rdev.  The only thing
that I can possibly think of is that lilo duplicates the
functionality of rdev internally and modifies the kernel image.
It would be easy to test this by copying the kernel image to
another filename, then changing lilo.conf, running lilo, and then
comparing the two kernel images for differences.  I'll leave that
to someone else though...
YMMV.
