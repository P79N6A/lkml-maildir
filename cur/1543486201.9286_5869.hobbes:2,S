AC> Differences between 2.2.1ac5 and 2.2.1ac6
AC> o	IDE SCSI lun fix				(Wolfgang Wander)
This time it really seems to work. It doesn't hang any more on ide-scsi
loading.
Still - I saw a problem with ide-scsi that I have not seen before.
To test the translation problem I loaded/unloaded sr_mod several times
because it got the wrong parameters. On a "modprobe sr_mod" I got the
following:
Detected scsi CD-ROM sr0 at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun0
bug: kernel timer added twice at c4848239.
The nearest address address is scsi_sleep (scsi_sleep+369) but
scsi_sleep is not long enough (scsi_sleep+154 is the last insn).
/proc/ksyms told nothing closer :-(
This is proably induced by the transaltion bug but I'm not 100% sure.
Now if we could do the same to the ide-scsi translation problem...
I'm willing to test the patches out (as before).
