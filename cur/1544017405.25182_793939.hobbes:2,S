It would probably be nice to mention that it's calculating per cpu
load addresses for early access.  The comment only refers to gdt_page
which is a bit misleading as it now also adjusts irqstackptr.
Also, as pda field name, irqstackptr might be fine but wouldn't it be
better to rename it to at least irq_stack_ptr as this change requires
touching every users anyway?
Thanks.
