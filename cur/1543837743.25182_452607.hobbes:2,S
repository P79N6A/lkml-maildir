A buffer_head is a caching entity and a bio is an IO container.  They're
quite separate concepts.
A buffer_head is the kernel's sole abstraction of a disk block. 
Filesystems use disk blocks a lot, and they need such an abstraction.
If one was to replace buffer_heads with direct-to-BIO operations then the
filesytem would need to internally track the mapping from
	page+offset+length -> disk block
and it would need to internally track the page+offset+length<->disk block
coherency state and it would need to internally perform serialisation of
access to each page+offset+length hunk of pagecache and etc and etc and
etc.  Create a data structure with which to do all that and voila,
buffer_heads reinvented.
