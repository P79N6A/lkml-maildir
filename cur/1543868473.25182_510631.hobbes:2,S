aio is not responsible for this particular synchronization.  Those fixes
(if we make them) should come from other places.  The patch is important
to get aio error handling right.
I would argue that one common cause of the EIO is userland
error (mmap concurrent with O_DIRECT), and EIO is the correct answer.
