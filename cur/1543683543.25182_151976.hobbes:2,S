Precisely he must, because he has misconfigured routes for the
behavior he desires.
His problem is about source address selection when trying to
contact a given destination.
If there is no specific source address specified, the kernel may
legally use any source address, and this decision extends to ARP
handling as well.
It's totally illogical to say that it's easier for him to patch his
kernel and reboot it than fix his route configuration.
