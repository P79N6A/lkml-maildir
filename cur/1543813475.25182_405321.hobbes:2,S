I'm not convinced of special casing mapped pages, nor of tunable knobs.
I've been working on implementing some page replacement algorithms that
have neither.
Breaking the LRU in two like this breaks the page ordering, which makes
it possible for pages to stay resident even though they have much less
activity than pages that do get reclaimed.
I have a serious regression somewhere, but will post as soon as we've
managed to track it down.
