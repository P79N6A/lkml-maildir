The results:

sys     1m12.970s
pre2+semaphore+throttle_IO
real    10m13.953s
user    6m19.980s
sys     0m28.960s
pre2+semaphore+throttle_IO extended to refill_inactive()
real    9m46.395s
user    6m23.510s
sys     0m29.420s
pre2+semaphore+throttle_IO + above + tiny little tweak to page_launder()
real    8m56.808s
user    6m23.420s
sys     0m29.430s
Unfortunately, when I try to get past this point I burn trees :-)
