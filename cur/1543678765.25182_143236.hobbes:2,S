Hello Sam,
> For the dvb case, the .h files are used by files located in:
> dvb/frontends
> dvb/ttpci
Just to get things straight:
Current header files, which must be present for user space
applications, are located in include/linux.
The internal header files for the dvb-core are in
drivers/media/dvb/dvb-core.
These are accessed by drivers/media/dvb/frontends for example,
this is true.
 > Therefore I suggested linux/media.
There is no particular reason that they must stay there, so
I suggest that I move them to include/dvb just like hch said.

If this is ok, I'll do this with the next patchset.
CU
Michael.
