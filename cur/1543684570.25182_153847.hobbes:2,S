The get_status function is called multiple times during card
initialisation.  I doubt that it is valid to compare the get_status
values from 2.4 and 2.6 kernels, without examining what's going on
in the cs.c code.
It would be helpful if you could apply the patch to cs.c which I've
recently posted to lkml, and report back the full kernel messages,
including the messages you get from your printk in yenta_get_status().
