IMHO, Linus has a grudge against Con, but I can't understand, why. Con has 
written nice code, I use it even now, I'm glad to have nice high-interactive 
system on desktop. But "a grudge" is not an argument for Linus, it's better not 
to make a decision by himself, but to let the community to decide, what is 
better - CFS or SD.
Question is not only in CFS vs SD, but in -ck patchset. Linus must remember 
that he has lost nice code and nice maintainer, and it's not a right decision. 
Linux is a public OS, so let people decide themselves, but not Linus himself.
