hi,
i'm a linux newbie trying to learn kernel magic. i would be glad if
someone can advice me where to look for to get an idea of the linux
kernel. hey i don't need that one. ( "use the force, read the source" )
i already tried to use the force , but can't figure out where i should
concentrate to get an idea of linux core kernel.
any advice or suggestions are welcome.
