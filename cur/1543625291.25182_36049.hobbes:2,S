Thanks.  This also points out that I mistakenly said DMA rather than
UDMA.  Someone else mentioned to me that MDMA worked for them as well.
It would have been "fine" if the serverworks driver didn't leave UDMA on
when it's off by default in the CONFIG.  At least then you would be
making the choice to specifically enable UDMA at your own risk...

Quite possible.  I'm only seeing this on ServerWorks mobos with IDE as
primary (vs SCSI).  I heard third-hand via a FreeBSD post that it's an
OSB4 issue effecting them as well.  Are Seagates a requirement for the
issues?
As to whether they can reproduce it... I'm not holding my breath for
them to try.
Thanks much for the info,
