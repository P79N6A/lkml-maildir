Yes, you probably don't want to have to specialcase anything there.

To my handwaving ears end of the address space sounds very good though. 
Is there currently any pressure on VMALLOC_RESERVE (128M)? Teaching the 
linker appears to be a matter of changing __KERNEL_START. That leaves 
actually mapping ourselves there, and... more invasiveness?
I saw you say you already have some actual relocating patches though?
Rene.
