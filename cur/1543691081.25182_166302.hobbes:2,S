And you broke one of the primary users of the atyfb driver,
the sparc64 platform.
We don't even get a console if this driver is non-functional,
that's the part you don't understand.  On x86 one can at least
use the VGA or Vesa drivers, we simply don't have that option.
So effectively, you've made 2.4.23-preX completely nonusable for
the vast majority of sparc64 users.

Your change is a major regression and we should revert it until
the kinks are worked out.
