Hmm.  I don't quite follow your reasoning.  Does the kernel already
perform fitness tests on random data from other drivers?  I don't
think so.
The i810 rng seems much less prone to entropy failure than the data
currently collected from I/O events.  Why are fitness tests for it more
important than for the existing entropy sources that are currently in
the kernel?
What am I missing?
