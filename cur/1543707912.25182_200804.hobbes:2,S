Perhaps, but it's harder to repeat than using my crosstool script;
you said you had to munge a bunch of header files, but with
crosstool no special munging is required.  AFAIR you haven't
posted your header-munging procedure.
It's vaguely possible that your header munging was wrong, which
caused that one diff on alpha.
Say, could you compare compiling the kernel with the two
toolchains, and see if there are any differences?
