Hi Jiri,
I was changing joydev.c in a tainted kernel (ubuntu 2.6.20) but with
an unchanged joy structure. I'm still trying to make the new kernel
(from kernel.org) run on my box but I'm getting a device-mapper error
several times per second and it seems is something related to mdadm
raid software it was installed. Will continue to try and get the HID
debug messages (as ubuntu's source doesn't have it)
Apart from that, I did the auto calibration for two reasons:
 1. getting the min/max information from input_dev, the device was
giving me -127/127 instead of 0/4096. The problem can be below the
joydev.c level, on HID (as you say) but there's a second reason.
 2. The windows driver, developed by saitek itself (I suppose) have
exactly the same behaviour. Every time I plug the joy in it's
uncalibrated, than I have to move around a few times and play. Not
much harassment, but I believe that, if they did it in their own
driver it's because they don't trust their own hardware.
Anyway, I'll continue with the kernel 2.6.21 in which I have enabled
HID debugging messages and will send you the logs as soon as I have
them.
cheers,
