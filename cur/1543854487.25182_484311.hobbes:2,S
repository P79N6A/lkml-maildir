Thanks for testing this.

Well, this trace apparently comes from xfssyncd wich explicitly calls
try_to_freeze().  When does this happen?

It looks like xfs is the only filesystem that really implements bdev freezing,
so for other filesystems it's irrelevant.  However, it may affect the dm, and
I'm not sure what happens if someone tries to use a swap file on a dm
device for the suspend _after_ we have frozen bdevs.

I think we should prevent filesystems from submitting any new I/O after
processes have been frozen, this way or another.
Greetings,
