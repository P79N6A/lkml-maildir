As far as I understand comments in the isdn_ppp.c kernel source,
for the some compression methods the comopression control protocol
interacts with the compressor/decompressor in a non-trival manner
which is not covert by the current compression
API. isdn_ppp.c contains some special hooks to partially handle CCP inside
the kernel to resolve this. This might be the reason why not all compressors
can be used with the async ppp driver.

2.3.x now has a generic ppp layer that can be used by any framing device.
Howevr, this is fairly new and ISDN does not use it. It might be
possible and I agree with you that this is The Right Thing (TM), but
this is certainly a task not to be started before 2.4.x is out.
