BTW, Nick, does your SMT scheduler have "idle package prioritization"
which chooses an idle logical processor with the other local processor
idle if any (rather than just an idle processor with other local
processor running at full speed), when the scheduler requires an idle
local processor? That would prevent situations like two logical
processors run at full speed in the same processor package, with the
other processor package(s) idle in a same processor package(s). I
haven't reviewed your latest patch closely, and that is the one of the
things I want to do during the holidays.
One question. Why did you remove SD_FLAG_IDLE flag from cpu_domain
initialization in the w27 patch? We've been seeing some performance
degradation with w27, compared to w26.
