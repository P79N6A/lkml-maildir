Oh, I know it does.  That was just a "convert to proper coding format in
15 minutes" patch.  You should start with that and work from there.
But, if you are going to do this, remember to submit in incremental
changes.  I suggest this patch go in, as it is just a reformatting,
nothing else.  Then you can work from there, changing the actual logic
of the code.
thanks,
