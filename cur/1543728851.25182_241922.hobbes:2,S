wli,
I did as you suggested and booted a kernel with HIMEM set but mem
set to 700M in boot params:
user-defined physical RAM map:
 user: 0000000000000000 - 000000000009fc00 (usable)
 user: 000000000009fc00 - 00000000000a0000 (reserved)
 user: 00000000000e8000 - 0000000000100000 (reserved)
 user: 0000000000100000 - 000000002bc00000 (usable)
0MB HIGHMEM available.
700MB LOWMEM available.
I get the same behaviour as if I had not specified HIMEM (fast directory
access)  The exact same kernel without the mem=700M runs slow.
