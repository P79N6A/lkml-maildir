There is only one process waiting on the completion object.

That possibility crossed my mind but I ruled it out since the the
timeout is 10 sec while completion arrived less then 4 msec after
calling wait_for_completion_timeout(). So it appears to me unlikely that
it will the task will be in the run list but will not get CPU time for
nearly 10 seconds. I will give it a try though. I will increase timeout
to 20 sec.
