OK, so you almost certainly ARE a troll:
1) proposing to remove support for hardware many of us use
   every day
2) on purpose going against tradition
3) replying private email back to the list
4) and all this using  Microsoft Outlook ;)
The hints pointing towards "troll, Troll, TROLL" are
overwhelming.
Lets stop the thread here.

Rik
