I scare myself shitless that you as the one responsible for something
as crucial as MM in the Linux kernel, has such an attitude towards
software development especially when people like RvR as for docs.
Sorry, but to me this sounds like something from M$ (MAPI? You don't
need MAPI documentation. We know what we're doing. You don't need to
know how Windows XX works. It's enough that we know).
Actually, you _do_ get documentation from M$. Something, one can't say
about the Linux MM-sprikled-with holy-penguin-pee subsystem.
I'm not happy about your usage of magic numbers, either. So it is
still running on solid 2.2.19 until further notice (or until Rik loses
his patience. ;-) )
