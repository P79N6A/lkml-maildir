Hi all,
	Some days back there were some messages regarding the bootscreen.  
I have a port for the linux progress patch that works fine. I have tried 
it only on x86 but should work fine on others too.  I think we are not 
permitted to send attachments to this list. So i had to keep it on my 
homepage.  It can be downloaded from 
http://gdit.iiit.net/~prasad_s/lpp/
This is a simple port, which i did in order to tryout the progress patch. 
so there could be some problems. feel free to mail suggessions to me.
The patch is for 2.4.18-4 (The default kernel in redhat7.3). However 
theres an rpm of the same for redhat-8.0 (this rpm installs only the 
kernel support. so you will have to download and use files that are 
included in the patch tarball for redhat7.3)
Prasad.
