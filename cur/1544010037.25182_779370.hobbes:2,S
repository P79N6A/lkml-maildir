No problem, it's not holding up anything. The question of how to extend
skb hasn't been settled either. Thanks for taking the time to consider
it.

That's true. I could keep the code separate, if that helps. I just
didn't want to duplicate the whole structure definition.

There are two additional ways of using the counter:
* Get nanosecond delay measurements (clocksource_read_ns). Calling this
  "resets" the counter.
* Get a continously increasing timer value 
  (clocksource_init_time/clocksource_read_time). The clock is only reset
  when calling clocksource_init_time().
The two are mutually exclusive because clocksource_read_time() depends
on clocksource_read_ns(). If this is too confusing, then
clocksource_read_ns() could be turned into an internal helper function.
I left it in the header because there might be other uses for it. The
rest of the patches only needs clocksource_read_time().
Nanoseconds never have to be converted back to the counter. That
wouldn't be possible anyway (hardware counter might roll over, whereas
the clock counts nanoseconds in a 64 bit value and thus will last longer
than the hardware it runs on).

About right ;-)

Some additional members must be moved to struct counter:
* cycle_last (for the overflow handling)
* xtime_nsec (for the continously increasing timer)
Except from those the first struct is okay.

Exactly. My plan was that the user of such a custom clocksource is
responsible for querying it often enough so that clocksource_read_ns()
can detect the wrap around. This works in the context of PTP (which
causes regular events). Network driver developers must be a bit careful
when there is no active PTP daemon: either they reinitialize the timer
when it starts to get used or probe it automatically after certain
delays.

I'm not sure what can be done in such a case. Use decent hardware which
doesn't wrap around so quickly, I guess. It's not an issue with the
Intel NIC (sorry for the advertising... ;-)

The clocksource API extension and the time sync code are independent at
the moment: the time sync code assumes that it gets two, usually
increasing timer values and tries to match them by measuring skew and
drift between them. If the timer values jump, then the sync code adapts
these values accordingly.
I don't think it will be necessary to add something like adjtimex() to a
clocksource. Either the hardware supports it natively (like the Intel
NIC does, sorry again), or the current time sync deals with frequency
changes by adapting the drift factor.

Thanks for your comments. I agree that splitting the structures would
help. But the variables really have the same meaning. They are just used
in different functions.
