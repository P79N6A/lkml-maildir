Getting rid of jiffies in its current form is a huge win for very
non-religious reasons. Jiffies is expensive in power management and
virtualisation because you have to maintain it.
Swap jiffies for jiffies() and the world gets a lot better. 
In actual fact you also want to fix users of
	while(time_before(foo, jiffies)) { whack(mole); }
to become
	init_timeout(&timeout);
	timeout.expires = jiffies + n
	add_timeout(&timeout);
	while(!timeout_expired(&timeout)) {}
Which is a trivial wrapper around timers as we have them now
