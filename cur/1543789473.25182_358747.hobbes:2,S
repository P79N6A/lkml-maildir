Not yet. But could you change this line at least?
+	
+	for_each_node(node) {
+		io_tlb_start = alloc_bootmem_node(NODE_DATA(node), iotlbsz);
for_each_node() loop walks around node_possible_map which includes
"offlined" node. 
Please use for_each_online_node() instead. Then, I'll check it. :-)
And I understand why my patch doesn't work on your box by
your patch. (Thanks!)
x86-64's DMA zone is smaller area than 16MB.
But swiotlb requires the area which is smaller than 4GB.
There is no interface to describe its difference.
I think your patch looks reasonable for 2.6.14 to be produced ASAP.
This is less impact than mine. 
However, kernel should have new interface like alloc_bootmmem_low32().
This problem will occur not only by swiotlb.
I'll rewrite my patch to make it. If it is applied at 2.6.15,
I'll be glad.
Thanks.
