Would that matter?  Yes, if vmscan sneaked in at some point while
page_table_lock is dropped, and wrote away the page with the earlier data.
But I was worrying about the reverse case, that we clear dirty, then
another thread sets it again before we emerge from copy_page_range,
so it gets left behind granting get_user_pages write permission.
Hmm, that implies that the other thread doesn't yet see wrprotect
(because we've not yet flushed TLB), which probably implies it would
still see dirty set: and so not set it again, so not a possible case.
But that's a precarious, processor-dependent argument: I don't think
it's safe to rely on, and your reverse case is already a problem.
I don't believe there's a safe efficient way we could batch clearing
dirty there.  We could make a second pass of the whole mm after the
flush TLB has asserted the wrprotects; but that won't win friends.
I'm thinking of reverting to the old __follow_page, setting write_access
-1 in the get_user_pages special case (to avoid change to all the arches,
in some of which write_access is a boolean, in some a bitflag, but in
none -1), and in that write_access -1 case passing back the special
code to say do_wp_page has done its full job.  Combining your and
Nick's and Andrew's ideas, and letting Martin off the hook.
Or would that disgust you too much?  (We could give -1 a pretty name ;)
Working on it now, but my brain in an even lower power state than ever.
Hugh
