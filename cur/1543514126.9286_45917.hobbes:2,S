Ob fancy permission bits on directories, what does the suid bit do on a
directory? I grok sgid (damn useful on /usr/local/* until a /usr/local
rpm undoes my ch{mod,own} work (I have that section 2775 (?, sgid),
group wheel)), and thanks for the clear expanation of the sticky bit
(1xxx?).  I don't have easy access to good unix literature and I was
unable to discover suid's effects on a directory myself.
TIA
