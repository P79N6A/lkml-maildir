    Hi Andrey :)
    Thanks for answering :)

    I know, but I just use it for mousedev O:)

    But not char-major-13-32, for example.

    But that code works with the 'input_table', and the
input_handlers. The handlers are registered by the modules when they
are already loaded. Do you mean that I should modify input_open_file
in order to autoload the appropriate module in the case of the
handler not being present? Currently input_open_file just returns
ENODEV in that case, but I don't know how to request for autoloading
O:) In fact, if Vojtech hasn't already done that surely there is a
very good reason not to do it... I prefer not modify the kernel for
that. If the only solution is making mousedev and hid built-in
instead of modules, I can do it.

    OK..

    The problem is that hotplug doesn't work for me in this case. I
mean, with hotplug in *this particular case*, since the mouse is
always connected, the modules will be loaded on bootup and unloaded
on shutdown, not when the mouse device is opened and closed,
respectively.
    I've tested with hotplug (well, I don't have hotplug utilities
installed, just a shell script that tells me if someone is calling
/sbin/hotplug and logs the parameters), and /sbin/hotplug is not
called when I try to open /dev/mouse (c 13 32).

    My excuses O:) I was refering to char-major-13-32 (or -64, is
just the same for me).

    Yes, I knew that. It is loaded by hotplug or by hand (or even
with 'above' or 'below' when another module is autoloaded, I
suppose).
> Building it in kernel is the easiest way to ensure it is always available.
    Yes, I'm going to build in hid, but, should I do the same with
mousedev (or event, joystick, etc...) or will it work with hid loaded
when doing 'cat /dev/mouse'?
    Thanks a lot for your help :))
