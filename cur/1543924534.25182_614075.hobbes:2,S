It looks like you missed my emails.
Firstly, I reproduced (or just find the same myself :) ) the issue with kernel 2.6.22,
2.6.23-rc and 2.6.23.
Ingo wrote a big patch to fix it and the new patch is in 2.6.24-rc1 now.
Then I retested it with 2.6.24-rc1 on a couple of x86_64 machines. The issue
disappeared. You could test it with 2.6.24-rc1.

Sorry. Intel policy doesn't allow me to publish the numbers because only
specific departments in Intel could do that. But I could talk the regression
percentage.
