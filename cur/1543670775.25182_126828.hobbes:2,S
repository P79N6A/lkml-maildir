yes.

I completely agree. The major cost is the mangling of the pagetables
that makes the ~32G case worthwhile only with largepages (better drop
some ram and use largepages than add more ram w/o largepages). I just
fixed my tree to allow up to 64G in largepages in a single file because
16G was a too low limit now. So sys_remap_file_pages should provide few
performance advantages, and its main benefit is in avoiding all the ram
waste with the vmas (and the rmap waste if rmap is used in the VM) which
contraddicts the "generic" usage with VM knowledge that may add overhead
(I mean the partial object over the remap-file-pages).
If we can get sys_remap_file_pages running at zero space overhead with
vm knowledge that's ok, but at least from my part I much prefer being
able to mix multiple files in the same mmap(VM_NONLINEAR) than to have
vm knowledge on the VM bypass.
