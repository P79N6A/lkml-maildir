Oh indeed it is not. Have a look at EU reverse engineering law and
caselaw if you are really that curious to see where the line lands
(I'm not). A lot of it depends how you define "a product". 
Writing a tool to extract BK repositories into an open format (ok
except that BK is basically already in an open format at the
moment but suppose it changed..) would be an obvious example.
You might however get your backside kicked if you had people
reverse engineer BK and then write a copy of it.
It isnt entirely that complex: Are a laser printer and its ink
cartridge two products, or a mobile phone and its battery ?
