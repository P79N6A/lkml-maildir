It is true I forgot to list your comments in the summary I sent out yesterday.
However rest assured that I took them into account. If you noticed in my annoucement
for 2.6.18, I have removed the perfmon KAPI interface, for instance. As for the UUID
 to string conversion, this was also pointed out by Andrew and it is work-in-progress.
So here is the additional feedback I will put in the summary:
[hch]: remove perfmon kernel-level API (perfmon_kapi.c), it is not justified
	- done
[hch]: use strings insead of UUID
	- work in progress
In general, I do listen to comments. The summary of changes is a good proof
of that, I think.
Thanks.
