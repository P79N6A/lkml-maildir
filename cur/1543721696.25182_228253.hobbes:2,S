Right, this is my point.

In any case bad sector checksum is hardware bug. Sector write is supposed to be
atomic, it either happens or not.

Well, if there is bad sector checksum inside journal block, ext3 won't be
all that happy about this for sure (and most of other journaling filesystems as
well, I am sure).

True.
Even if you write 512K of data and have 1Mb journal, still there is no atomicity
guarantee.

Well, if you go with less than 1 block size updates (that do not cross block
boundaries), this can be done atomically. (with help of fsync and stuff).

Well, for flash memory there is jffs2, it does (data) journalling and supports
compression. And it can even work over conventional block devices via mtd block
emulation, I think. Basically jffs2 is one large fs-sized journal as I
understand it.
