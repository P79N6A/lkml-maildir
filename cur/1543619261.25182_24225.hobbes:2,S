Hello.
How can I determine that the program is run via ssh or on
a headless box?
The problem is with Linux Console Tools. It tries opening 
/dev/tty, /dev/tty0 and /dev/console respectively upon the 
start, and it fails on ssh'ed or headless boxes. Is there 
any way to catch the situation? I've thought that open should
return ENODEV in these cases, but it doesn't..
