I would hope anyone bothering to include the constants in a document would
spend a few minutes explaining them as well. Perhaps a bad assumption
on my part...

correct.

I don't know how BIOS's treat this (if at all). Need to know this first.
If they manage this resource and pre-assign everything, ok.
That's how it goes.
But if generic PCI manages this, I prefer to avoid allocating resources
that may not get used.  The host platform may have a limited pool of
usable MSI data values (think parisc EIRR bits) and some cards may want
to use more than one MSI.
