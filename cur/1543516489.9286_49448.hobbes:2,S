No. I'll try setting some limits. However I don't think that this
happened until I upgraded to RedHat 6.0 (about a week before 6.1 was
released), and enlightenment was installed. I'll try going back to fvwm2
for a bit. I was running 2.2 before that, so its not a kernel upgrade
that caused it.
The extra memory requirements of E is was made me think of an OOM
situation. If Netscape tries to grab excessive amounts of memory, and
we're low on memory, shouldn't it be killed?
Thanks,
Bradley
