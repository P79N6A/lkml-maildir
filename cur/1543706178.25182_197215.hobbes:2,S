Yes! That was it. Attached is the output I captured from reiserfsck. 
It identified the very file I was attempting to remove that was causing
the segfault in rm(1).
So I guess this is a reiserfs specific issue when it kills all disk I/O
when this correcption happens. Hmm.
Thanks Oleg for your help.
