   This patch enables HW-checksum against outgoing packets including UDP frames.
Can you explain the TCP parts?  They look very wrong.
It was discussed long ago that csum_and_copy_from_user() performs
better than plain copy_from_user() on x86.  I do not remember all
details, but I do know that using copy_from_user() is not a real
improvement at least on x86 architecture.
The rest of the changes (ie. the getfrag() logic to set
skb->ip_summed) looks fine.

ftp://ftp.valinux.co.jp/pub/people/taka/2.5.36/va-csumpartial-fix-2.5.36.patch
   This patch fixes the problem of x86 csum_partilal() routines which
   can't handle odd addressed buffers.
I've sent Linus this fix already.
