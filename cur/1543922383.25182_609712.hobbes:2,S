I guess potentially things that are today in /proc/sys/*. Sysfs is much
closer to the "right" place for this kind of attributes than procfs,
isn't it?

Obviously I'm for that too. A mandatory cc to a linux-abi list,
documentation, and an acked-by from the relevant API maintainers, etc.
All it needs is upstream to agree and sometime to implement it.

If it fits with the overall direction that yourself / Kay / everyone
else has in mind, then yes. Problem is that if this stuff goes
unreviewed, or reviewed by different people who don't have a coherent
idea of what the API should look like, then it ends in a mess that you
can't fix easily.
