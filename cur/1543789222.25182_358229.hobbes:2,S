Well yes, that's on the store side (1, above). However can't a CPU
still speculatively (eg. guess the branch) load the page->flags
cacheline which might be satisfied from memory before the page->count
cacheline loads? Ie. you can still have the correct write ordering
but have incorrect read ordering?
Because neither PageDirty nor page_count is a barrier, and there is
no read barrier between them.
