Well, I disagree very much with this patch.
One of the interest of fget_light() is not dirtying file structure (avoiding 
atomic changes to f_count).
You add a 'flag' (4 bytes !) at the end of the file structure (so in a 
different cache line than the parts that are usually accessed in a fd_related 
syscall) and dirty this part at syscall entry and exit. Thats really a heavy 
price for supporting an unlikely revoke() syscall.
Also, the thing is racy.
( BTW, the whole revoke() concept is evil, especially if we want to avoid 
using inodes/dentries for some kind of pseudo files like sockets / pipes)
Cannot we use a flag in 'struct files_struct', set to one when the task is 
mono-thread (at task creation in fact), and set to 0 when it creates a new 
thread  (or when someone remotely access to this "struct files_struct" 
in /proc/pid/fd/... )
No need to set back this flag to 1 when task revert to mono-threaded, since 
this case is probably unlikely. This way we can be non racy.
