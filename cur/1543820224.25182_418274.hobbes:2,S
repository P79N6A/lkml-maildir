Is there any news on that? Can we use the scsi_get/put_command() functions for allocating a "struct scsi_cmnd" or should we allocate it with kmalloc() or somehow like that? Or, Christoph, did you already make the second patch for the gdth driver? 
We want to bring the gdth driver up to date as soon as possible. Any help is greatly appreciated! 
Thanks,
Achim

Hi all,
The patch looks good for 2.6.17-rc1. Christoph, did you already make the second patch for the real switchover? 
Will only the scsi_allocate_request()/scsi_do_req()/scsi_release_request() be removed in the next kernel releases? - I'm wondering if I could use the scsi_get_command()/scsi_put_command() functions to get a Scsi_Cmnd struct. and to send it to the gdth_queuecommand()/gdth_next(). I'm willing to make and test the second patch but please give me some hints what functions you plan to kill and what function we can still use. 
Thanks & Regards,
Achim

Hi folks,
the gdth driver is the only driver using (and in this case abusing) the
scsi_request interface we plan to kill for 2.6.17.  I've sent a patch
that's a first step to convert the driver away from it a few weeks ago
but didn't get any response.  I urgently need testers to keep the driver
for 2.6.17+.  Else it'll be marked broken until we get a person to help
testing the changes needed to resurrect it.
