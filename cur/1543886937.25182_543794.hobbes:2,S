Subject: [PATCH] Workaround for a PCI restoring bug
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hello,
as of 2.6.21-git16, the bugs related to restoring PCI are still present. The
save pci function reads only -1 from the PCI config space and when restoring,
it messes up totaly most PCI devices. The attached patch is workaround only
until proper fix is found and included. Could it be included into the mainline
for now?
