[root@thor /root]# cat /proc/interrupts

Whoa!  Does eth0 on Int15h raise a big flag in anyone else's
book?!?!?!

Er, maybe.  I mean, my first instinct when coming to the company
mid-last year was NOT to use Linux to serve out Solaris clients
(and I'm a _huge_ Linux advocate) because of NFS issues/performance.
But I hope someone can confirm (solid, i.e. no doubts -- because I
have to take our sole fileserver down when I do this -- in a 24x7
production environment) that I will have problems if my NIC is on
Int 15h?
