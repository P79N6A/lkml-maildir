Check the boot msgs. You're kernel is compiled w/ CONFIG_X86_TSC, so it
should print a warning as such stating it is ignoring the notsc option.
Try compiling the kernel for i386 and the kernel then boot w/ notsc. Do be
warned, if you're running w/ an i686 compiled glibc your box will hang
after the "Freeing unused kernel memory: " msg. 
Another thing to check is if the lost-tick compensation code is biting you.
Try commenting out the "detect_lost_tick()" call from timer_interrupt() in
arch/i386/kernel/time.c
Let me know if that changes anything.
thanks
