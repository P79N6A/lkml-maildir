Subject: [patch] arch-specific cond_syscall usage issues

Experimenting with trying to use cond_syscall for a few arch-specific
syscalls, I discovered that it can't actually be used outside the file
in which sys_ni_syscall is declared because the assembler doesn't feel
obliged to output the symbol in that case:
weak.c:
#define cond_syscall(x) asm(".weak\t" #x "\n\t.set\t" #x ",sys_ni_syscall");
cond_syscall(sys_foo);
$ nm weak.o
         U sys_ni_syscall
One arch (PPC) is apparently trying to use cond_syscall this way
anyway, though it's probably never been actually tested as the above
test was done on a PPC.
After trying a bunch of tricks to get it to work nicely, I decided
there are basically two alternatives: make weak versions of
sys_ni_syscall wherever they're wanted or put the arch-specific
cond_syscalls in kernel/sys.c where sys_ni_syscall is defined.
The former approach is a bit crufty and doesn't actually do the right
thing in practice as you'll get multiple copies of sys_ni_syscall in
your final image.
The latter introduces some slight arch-pollution in sys.c, but as
arch-specific cond_syscalls aren't all that frequent, it should be
pretty minor. So here's a patch to move the current offender to sys.c:
