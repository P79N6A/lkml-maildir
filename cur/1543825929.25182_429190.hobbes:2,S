In my system, this huge device is difficult.
I often need to reboot, and run xfs_repair, to make it clean. (nodes hangs,
reboots, etc...)
On the beginning, i use the xfs_repair without any options, but it requires
to do a mount/umount the mtp before.
The problem is, i often get an error message, (dump) during the journal
recovery, and after i cannot run the xfs_repair from script, because it
needs the log done by mount.
Now is my default reboot option is xfs_repair -L, so i dont know, this
happens before, or after, sorry.

The qouta stop solves the hangs problem.
This is a bug?
