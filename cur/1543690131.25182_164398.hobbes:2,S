Well, despite the fact that you have a somewhat offensive tone, I do 
take what you're saying seriously.  Not to say that I'm ENTIRELY 
discouraged, but your point that I need to have something a lot more 
solid is well taken.
Fortunately, my post has had the intended effect:  other people have 
responded with specific good ideas, ones which can possibly be used to 
produce something more concretely useful than the vague notion I posited.
I don't believe I will completely give up my habit of suggesting vague 
ideas, because it has been a successful approach in the past.  Other 
intelligent people naturally fill in the holes with knowedge and ideas 
of their own.  On the other hand, before I go off with something too 
vague, perhaps I will flesh it out with more thought on my own.  I hope 
adding too many of my own ideas won't bias others or prevent people from 
suggesting alternatives.
