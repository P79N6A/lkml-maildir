exactly what is the problem with keeping intrusive debugging patches
separate, just like all the other ones are kept separate? It's not like
this came out of the blue, per-CPU trace buffers (and other tracers) were
done years ago for Linux.

(this is in essence a moving spinlock at the tail of the trace buffer -
same problem.)
