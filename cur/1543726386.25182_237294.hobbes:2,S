(Side note: don't know what an rtl8169 costs today, but I'd rather buy
an Intel gigE desktop adapter. Card/driver combination just works
great, no hassle at all.)

Not spectecular. Even with that kind of hardware you should be able to
do around 20MB/s for NFS (depending on hard drive, of course).

Gig-ethernet can be a bit picky about cable quality. If the quality is
too low, it will go back too fast ethernet pergormance. Get a straight
Cat 5E cable (i.e.: no cross cable) from your local computershop, that
should just do. Cat 5 usually also works, but is not certified for
gig-ethernet speeds (usually works, if not, use Cat 5E).

Mii-tool or eth-tool.

I think you're hearing interrupts. Especially with the normal 1500
bytes ethernet MTU and no NAPI, gig-ethernet can send quite some
packets which on their turn will generate quite some interrupts, which
will cause the CPU to do something, which on its turn will cause the
PSU have to put out more power, which you will be able to hear.

What you describe as "nonsense" is most probably a kernel Oops.
Developers are interested in such Oopses, so please mail them to this
mailing list.

Different CPU, different compiler flags, different timings, different
things to do. Might be sheer coincidence.

It's not the first time Linux triggers hardware bugs where Windows
doesn't.

Narrow down the problem. Get out all cards you don't need to reproduce
the problem and try to break the system again.

No idea, not enough information to tell. See the file REPORTING-BUGS in
your kernel tree and provide more information.
