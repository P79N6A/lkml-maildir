I'm sorry, but I heartily disagree.  It's not a quirky setup, it's just 
code that exposes a weakness just like thud, starve, irman, 
irman2.  Selectively bumping dd up into the upper tier won't do the other 
things trivially starved to death one bit of good.  On a more positive 
note, I agree that dd should not be punished for waiting on disk.

Then the (buggy) version of my simple throttling patch will need to come 
out.  (which is OK, I have a debugged potent++ version)

Grumble.  Pipe sleep.  That's another pet peeve of mine.  Sleep is sleep 
whether it's spelled interruptible_pipe or uninterruptible_semaphore.
