Agreed.

Came from the vendor that way.

We had multiple reports of users who encountered repeated memory
corruption when transferring large files while running with a 64-bit DMA
mask.  Chris Snook noticed the upper 32 bits of the descriptor address
register are shared among five other registers, each containing the low
bits for one of five descriptors.  All the descriptors, therefore, have
to live within the same 4GB address space.
I'll keep poking at it as time permits through the week, but I probably
won't be able to devote a whole lot of time to it until next weekend.
