If we don't evacuate all live data from all of the DIMM, we'll never be
able to power the thing down in many situations.
Given that we _have_ emptied the DIMM, we can just turn it off.  And
refilling it will be slow - often just disk speed.
So I don't see a useful use-case for non-destructive states.
