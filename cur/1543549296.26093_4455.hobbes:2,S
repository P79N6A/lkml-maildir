Subject: 2.2.17 crashes with RTL8139B and/or IPv6
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
I just upgraded our server (486DX2/120, running 186 days`) with a 100MBit
RTL8139B network card and moved from 2.2.14 to 2.2.17 in this process,
using the same .config (oldconfig) with two differences: IPv6 and the
RTL8139 drivers.
After about 20k of network activity the machine crashes (I cannot
reproduce the message here because the box locks solid while the top of
the message is above the top of the display, and the watchdog reboots the
box after 20 seconds), reproducible. Ext2 seems to confuse some blocks
(I've found portions of /var/lib/dpkg/available in
/var/log/apache/access.log) as well, so I suspect some sort of recursion
problem (would explain the long backtrace and the corrupted data).
System information:
Processor: AuthenticAMD 486 DX/4 stepping 4, no bugs, cpuid level 1, wp
  works in supervisor mode
Memory: 36MB real, 6x128MB swap
Harddisks: 2 IDE drives
PCI listing (Bus 0):
 - Dev 12, func 0: Realtek 8139 (rev 16) ethernet on IRQ 11 (inactive)
 - Dev 14, func 0: Realtek 8029 (rev 0) ethernet on IRQ 12
 - Dev 16, func 0: UMC UM8881F (rev 4) host bridge
 - Dev 18, func 0: UMC UM8886A (rev 14) ISA bridge
 - Dev 18, func 1: UMC UM8886BF (rev 16) IDE interface
The kernel is monolithic, no SCSI support. Relevant /proc files (from the
2.2.14 kernel, 2.2.17 is too unstable) attached. I'm sorry that I can't
provide more info, but having a running server is important to me... :-)
