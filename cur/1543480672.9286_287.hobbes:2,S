On all archs, clone (CLONE_VM|CLONE_VFORK|SIGCHLD, NULL)
will do the job, plus I think alpha, sparc and sparc64 will have regular
vfork syscall (as they have to implement it for DU/Solaris/SunOS
compatibility anyway).
I think the __NR_vfork in i386's unistd.h could go away, I think vfork has
not been in l-k for long and nobody released yet a libc with that vfork...
Cheers,
