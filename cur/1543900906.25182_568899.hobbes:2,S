It's a recent addition to the API ... the previous way of doing it was
flush_dcache_page() but that's expensive and flushes all the user
aliases.  Since you know in this case there are no current user aliases
and you only need to flush the kernel alias, flush_kernel_dcache_page()
was introduced as the cheaper alternative.
