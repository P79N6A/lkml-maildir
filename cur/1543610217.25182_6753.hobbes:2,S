I was not aware of the causes, but that's actually kind of the problem.
Our main supplier says the 7000 series will be in 'soon' but the 6000 
series is available now.  We're at 95+% on the current setup, so now is 
better than soon :)
If worst comes to worst, we'll replace the 6800 when we add a second card. 
 I'm hoping Linux can handle it a little more gradefully than that, though.
