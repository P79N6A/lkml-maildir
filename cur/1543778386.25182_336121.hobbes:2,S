To answer for x *= 2 vs x <<= 1:
Use * when you would logically want to do a multiplication,
<< if you're working on a bitfield. It's just for keeping the code clean 
enough so that others may understand it.
In the longshot, it does not matter, as gcc will optimize out multiplication 
with powers of two to bitops.
