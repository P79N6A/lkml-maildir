Subject: SO_REUSEADDR: broke between 2.4.17 and .18

I have a server that uses SO_REUSEADDR. It used to work and nothing
changed in this area for a long while. A recent test fails with
"address already in use".
I just rebooted a few kernels and verified that:
	2.4.17 works OK.
	2.4.18 fails.
	2.4.19-pre8 fails.
	2.4.19-pre8-ac4 fails.
