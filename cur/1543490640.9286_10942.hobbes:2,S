To maintain an LRU ordering for recently released inodes, I imagine.
However, right now there's nothing I can see in inode.c which actually
relies on that ordering: whenever we do a free_inodes(), we dump all
the inodes that we can.  In the future, having a sane LRU ordering on
the in-use list may be valuable.
