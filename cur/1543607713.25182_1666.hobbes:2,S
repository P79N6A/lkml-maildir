Subject: [PATCH] 8139too reparent_to_init() race
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

hello all,
lately i noticed this message during boot-up (when the network
interfaces were being configured) ...
"task `ifconfig' exit_signal 17 in reparent_to_init"
this happens only about 1/2 of the time.
after some digging this is what i found...
sometimes ifconfig's parent exits before ifconfig reaches
rtl8139_thread().  when this happens, ifconfig's exit_signal is set to
SIGCHLD (in forget_original_parent), because its new parent is init.
then rlt8139_thread() is reached it calls reparent_to_init(), which
complains that exit_signal is already non-zero.
basically this patch stops rtl8139_thread() from calling
reparent_to_init() when its parent is already init.
is this the right way to fix the problem?
should reparent_to_init() check that the parent is not already init?
as a budding kernel hacker i would appreciate any comment on this
change.
please, cc me on replies.  i can only handle the digest form of this
list.
thanks.
rob.
