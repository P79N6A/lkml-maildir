Oh, I agree.  In your case this didn't show a Linux developer doing
anything stupid.  Instead, it showed the compiler doing something

You win some, you lose some.  But the end result will hopefully be that
the compiler gets fixed for this case.  Which is, after all, something
that benefits everybody.
