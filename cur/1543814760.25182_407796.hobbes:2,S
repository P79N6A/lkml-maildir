The sum cannot if there are no concurrent updates, however when
there are concurrent updates then it can go negative.
rq->nr_uninterruptible itself is meaningless because it can be
incremented on one rq and decremented on another.

Is there a need? Do they (except calc_load) use multiple values at
the same time?

I think it need only iterate over possible CPUs.

What are the performance critical places that call the nr_blah() functions?
