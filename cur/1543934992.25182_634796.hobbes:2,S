Adrian - it is you that miss the important piont in this discussion.
We have two simple options:
1) Allow the user to define non-valid configurations
2) And the opposite
And we want to define only valid configurations which is why we
with the present select behavious cannot just do "select USB",
becasue we may end up with USB selected but not what USB depends on.
And duplicating the dependencies of USB in all places where we
select USB is not a scalable solution.
So until we have select fixed - do not misue it.
