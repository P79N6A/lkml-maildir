I'm affected by this problem, hp nx7400 + Seagate Momentus 5400.3 160gb SATA
When "drive spins down, acpi_power_off is written on the console, the
drive spins up again, and 3-4 seconds later the notebook is powered
off, leaving disk heads not parked I think.
I've not tried any new kernel or patches. I'm using stock debian Etch
kernel 2.6.18-5-686.
