The "Pentium Pro Family Developer's Manual Volume 3: Operating System
Writer's Guide" (document number 242692) has an appendix on the
performance monitoring counters, and a full list of MSRs (well, except
for the ones they kept secret). On the Intel website they seem to have
superceded this with an equivalent document for the whole P6 range,
but that probably has the same information. If not, mail me for the
old one.
I don't see MSR 0x11 in the list.
