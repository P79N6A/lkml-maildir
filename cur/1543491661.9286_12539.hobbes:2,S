  Hi, all. Version 97 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This is against 2.2.5. Highlights of this release:
- Fixed bugs: compatibility entries were not unregistered for:
    ALSA sound driver
    partitions in generic disc driver
- Don't return unregistred entries in <devfs_find_handle>
- Panic in <devfs_unregister> if entry unregistered
- Don't panic in <devfs_auto_unregister> for duplicates
				Regards,
					Richard....
