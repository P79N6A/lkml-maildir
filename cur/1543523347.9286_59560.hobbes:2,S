Unless, of course, the motherboard in question is an Abit BP6. In which case, 
complain to Abit, because even when you tell its BIOS that IRQ9 is reserved 
for Legacy ISA, it puts ACPI there. 
Shift your 3c509 onto another IRQ and wait for a fixed BIOS.
Beware of making PCI IRQs share too much, though - I've found that if it tries 
to make a PCI device share IRQs with the on-board USB, then that PCI device  
can't actually generate any interrupts.
