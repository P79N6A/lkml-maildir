Thanks for this report!  This is the first I've heard of it (Adam CC'd
me, thanks!).
Turns out the "docbook2man" uses the *last* <refentrytitle> as the
output filename, so it was building "modprobe.d.5" instead of
"modprobe.conf.5".  As a result, modprobe.conf.5 was always old, even in
the tarball I uploaded for 3.1 (when the second refentrytitle went into
the man page), and every "make" tried to rebuild it.
Release coming,
Rusty.
