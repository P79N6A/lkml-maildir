Cool.  I'm glad to see the code is proving useful on other architectures.
I was hoping that would be the case.
BTW: The algorithm is documented in Section 8.5.2 of my book (see
http://www.lia64.org/book/
).  If there is enough interested, I'd be
willing to try to talk the publisher into releasing that section as a
PDF (or perhaps HTML).
