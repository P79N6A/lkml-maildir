I tested Andrea's latest kernel.  It survived.
Probably because it left 100 megabytes of lowmem unallocated
throughout the test.

Well, they should all be left running?  All this memory has
file-backing, and is easily reclaimable.
umm, yes.  There could be bogus oom-killings in the combined-LRU
VMs.  But I saw none in testing.
All of which is great fun, but it leaves open the question "what
the heck can vmware do about it". I wish there was a clear answer.
If the customer is running a suse/UL kernel they're presumably OK.
If their kernel comes from kernel.org they should add Andrea's patch.
Which means they get an absolute boatload of stuff which they may
not want:
 1223 files changed, 306053 insertions(+), 9655 deletions(-)
but that kernel performs well.
If they're running an RH-rmap kernel then they're probably okayish,
although I'd recommend more testing there.
If they're running an RHAS-style kernel then I do not know.  It may
fail.
