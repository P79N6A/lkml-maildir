I just wanted to report that I am hitting the "VFS: file-max limit xxx
reached" problem quite easily on my 32-cpu Niagara machine with 16GB
of ram with current 2.6.x GIT.
It seems far too easy to get a box into this state due to SLAB
fragmentation and RCU.  And once you get a machine into this state it
is totally unusable.
Our test case is usually a "make -j8192" kernel build along with a
parallel bootstrap of gcc.  That puts about 256 processes on each
cpu's runqueue, I doubt ksoftirqd can run much at all.
I think part of what helps trigger it might be ccache, which we are
using on this machine.  ccache seems to open up a ton of files each
build invocation.
Usually within an hour of that load you'll hit the nr_files limit and
you can't run anything and have to power-cycle.
I think we need to think seriously about this problem.
