Subject: [PATCH 05/23] proc: Simplify the ownership rules for /proc
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Currently in /proc if the task is dumpable all of files are owned by
the tasks effective users.  Otherwise the files are owned by root.
Unless it is the /proc/<tgid>/ or /proc/<tgid>/task/<pid> directory
in that case we always make the directory owned by the effective user.
However the special case for directories is pointless except as a way
to read the effective user, because the permissions on both of those
directories are world readable, and executable.
/proc/<tgid>/status provides a much better way to read a processes effecitve
userid, so it is silly to try to provide that on the directory.
So this patch simplifies the code by removing a pointless special case and
gets us one step closer to being able to remove the hard coded /proc inode
numbers.
