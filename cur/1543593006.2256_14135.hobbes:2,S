In my opinion 2.4.x is NOT ready for primetime.  The VM has been getting 
worse since 2.4.0, I believe.  Definitely since and including 2.4.3.  I 
cannot even edit a few images in gimp where the entire working set used 
to fit entirely in memory.  The system now locks in some loop (SAK still 
works).
FILE CACHING IS BROKEN.  I don't care who says what, by the time swap is 
half filled, it is time to start throwing away simple caches.  Not wait 
until there is no more memory free and then lock in an infinite loop.
My system has 128 Meg of Swap and RAM.
