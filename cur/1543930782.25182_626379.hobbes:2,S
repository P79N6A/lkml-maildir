That sounds too SELinux specific.  How do I do it so that it works for any
LSM?
Is linking against libselinux is a viable option if it's not available under
all LSM models?  Is it available under all LSM models?  Perhaps Casey can
answer this one.

So, who's right?

It's causing me lots of confusion as it is.  I have been / am being told by
different people to do different things just in dealing with SELinux, and
various people are raising extra requirements or restrictions beyond that.
There doesn't seem to be a consensus.
It sounds like the best option is just to have the kernel nick the userspace
daemon's security context and use that as is, and junk all the restrictions on
what the daemon can do so that the kernel isn't too restricted.
