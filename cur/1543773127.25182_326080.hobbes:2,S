hm - tricky, i think. because no kernel oopses, nothing to look at in the
syslog (yes?), various nic drivers affected, others not...in cases like
these only Documentation/BUG-HUNTING comes to my mind: if 2.6.8.1 works,
and 2.6.12-rc6 does not, we'll need to find out the kernelversion which
introduced this behaviour.
sorry,
Christian.
