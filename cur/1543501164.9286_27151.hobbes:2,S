I don't understand you.  I advocate using directories not streams.  You

When a file body contains a reference to another file, and the filter
replaces that reference with the contents of the other file in response

Microsoft integrates features of the gui into the kernel, you advocate
integrating features of the kernel into the gui, sigh.
All aspects of naming should function completely independently of the
gui.  They are orthogonal OS components.

I don't understand you, except that I think you know how you have seen
it done, and think that the way it has been done must be the right way.

Power users will love it.  If I implemented it only in the gui, then I
would have only gui users who can use it.

I suppose that when I introduce database style views (think clearcase,
but clean), you'll really hate that....
