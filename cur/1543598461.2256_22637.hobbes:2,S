By this logic a socket that is set non-blocking should always be
treated as readable. I think we can all agree that argument is
flawed :-).
The prevailing view from other systems appears to be that reading
from an unconnected (or unconnectING) socket is meaningless so
the socket is not readable.
Presumably there is a damn good reason, or a standards reference,
why that is the wrong behaviour and should be changed?
