To All:
	Lately, I've noticed these error messages in my var/log/messages file. 
Since I've been experiencing several unexplained freeze-ups lately, I think
this might be the cause, but I don't know how to fix the problem.  I checked
the linux-kernel archive, and found a few messages dealing with this problem,
but these messages concerned the 2.1.15 kernel, and I'm currently using 2.2.3. 
Both kmem and mem exist in my /dev directory.  Any thoughts?
