Hello,
sorry for the delay, I was having troubles compiling older KVMs with a
recent kernel...
The last version that works is kvm-21; starting from kvm-22 the VM
hangs during network initialization (now always, but pretty often).
This only occurs when the guest is Fedora7 setup ISO. The regular boot
(i.e. from the hd) seems unaffected.
