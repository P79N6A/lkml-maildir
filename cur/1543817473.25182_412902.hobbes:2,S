What I'm looking at is the following:
* use spi_bitbang_setup() as is
* have my chipselect do:
	if (BITBANG_CS_INACTIVE)
		deassert GPIO pin for CS
	else
		set HW mode register (polarity, phase, bit length)
		assert GPIO pin for CS
* setup_transfer()
	* set HW mode register (bit length)
	* call bitbang_setup_transfer()

Right, I dont think I need the support of setup_transfer() for my  
devices aren't
changing their settings mid message.  However, I do think some  
changes are needed to the patch
