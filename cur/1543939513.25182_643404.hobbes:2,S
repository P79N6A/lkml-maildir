That the admin would manage to deadlock him/herself and wedge up the
whole system...

This is only a guess, but I suspect it was a fail-safe in case the
admin did manage to deadlock him/herself.  
I would think a better approach would be to make the filesystem
unfreeze if the file descriptor that was used to freeze the filesystem
is closed, and then have explicit deadlock detection that kills the
process doing the freeze, at which point the filesystem unlocks and
the system can recover.
