Well in my case this has been happening quite a long time, and I am
currently running 2.6.22 from Debian and I don't see any such config
option in the config.
$ grep SCHED /boot/config-2.6.22-3-k7
CONFIG_IOSCHED_NOOP=y
CONFIG_IOSCHED_AS=y
CONFIG_IOSCHED_DEADLINE=y
CONFIG_IOSCHED_CFQ=y
CONFIG_DEFAULT_IOSCHED="cfq"
CONFIG_SCHED_SMT=y
CONFIG_SCHED_MC=y
CONFIG_NET_SCHED=y
# CONFIG_USB_EHCI_TT_NEWSCHED is not set
# CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS is not set
So no idea what could have started the problem originally.  I guess I
have to start booting some older kernels and seeing if that helps.
