well the feature is not complete and there are no reasons given _why_ 
it's not complete ... and even if there's a reason it should have been 
deferred to the next merge window. We still have 10 year old "this is a 
temporary hack" comments in the kernel ;-)
"hardware does not support it" is a valid argument, "kernel developer 
had no time to implement it properly" is not ;-)
