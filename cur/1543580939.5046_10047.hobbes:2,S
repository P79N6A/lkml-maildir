Its probably worth commenting at this point that the I2O message passing layers
do indeed have both #1 and #2 type descriptor chains to optimise performance
for different tasks. We arent the only people to hit this.
I2O supports 
	offset, pagelist, length
where the middle pages in the list are entirely copied
And sets of
