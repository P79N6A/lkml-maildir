Please tell me you've upgraded the compiler in your stock Red Hat 7.0
distribution? The original gcc-2.96-69 is famously known to be broken,
and should not be used to compile kernels. My quick-and-dirty advice
would be to nab the "rpm" for the latest build in Red Hat 7.2
(gcc-2.96-98), upgrade it and use that to recompile the kernel.
If that's not the problem, then no doubt others will be able to help
you....
Cheers
Alastair
