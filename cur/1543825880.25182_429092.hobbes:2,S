You shouldn't bisect blindly.
Looking at the series file
(
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.17-rc5/2.6.17-rc5-mm2/patch-series
):
...
add-scsi_add_host-failure-handling-for-nsp32.patch
qla1280-fix-section-mismatch-warnings.patch
bogus-disk-geometry-on-large-disks.patch
bogus-disk-geometry-on-large-disks-warning-fix.patch
megaraid_sas-switch-fw_outstanding-to-an-atomic_t.patch
megaraid_sas-add-support-for-zcr-controller.patch
megaraid_sas-add-support-for-zcr-controller-fix.patch
...
megaraid_sas-add-support-for-zcr-controller-fix.patch is a fix against
megaraid_sas-add-support-for-zcr-controller.patch, so if the bisection
lands you on megaraid_sas-add-support-for-zcr-controller.patch then
obviously one should apply
megaraid_sas-add-support-for-zcr-controller-fix.patch by hand as well.
You'll often find great streams of similarly-named contiguous patches - you
should apply either all of them or none of them.  Otherwise you're testing
a known-to-be-broken kernel which has an already-available fix ;)
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/bisecting-mm-trees.txt
describes the bisection technique I use.
If you're using git-bisect, well, try to have a nice day anyway.

Would be great, thanks.
