That's on the list for 2.3 apparently. There is talk of building a
generic bus structure into 2.3, describing the types of busses and
devices there under. All run-time configurable.
2.3 will also support hot-plug CPU's, RAM, motherboards, users...  
and will be able to autodetect your desired caffeine/milk/sugar/water
ratios and have a perfect bevvy waiting for you when you awake in
the morning (or afternoon if you are Alan Cox).
