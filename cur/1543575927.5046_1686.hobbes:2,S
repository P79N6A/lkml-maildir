I have been using the aa series kernels through out the 18pre series (with 
reiserfs).  They have worked very well.   Suggest you and Andrea talk and 
figure out what else from this series can be put into 19pre.  Believe the 
major changes left in the aa series are bigmem and lvm.  I would love to see 
lvm officially in 2.2...
Luck,
Ed Tomlinson
