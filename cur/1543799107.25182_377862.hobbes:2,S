AFAIK, XFS is the only example.
And the XFS related problems have already been fixed.

My count of bug reports for problems with in-kernel code with 4k stacks 
after Neil's patch went into -mm is still at 0.
If 4k stacks were as unstable as you imply, why has noone been able to 
point to _one single_ problem with 4k stacks that is still present 
after Neil's patch went into -mm?

That's complete bullshit.
Currently, seperate irq stacks are only used with 
CONFIG_4KSTACKS=y.
