Good news, Andrew. I run 50 fsx tests on ext3 filesystems on 2.5.70-mm9. 
   The hang problem I used seen on 2.5.70-mm6 kernel is gone. The tests 
runs fine for more than 9 hours. (Normally the problem will occur after 
7 hours run on 2.5.70-mm6 kernel).
I am running the tests on 8 way PIII 700MHz, 4G memory, with 
elevator=deadline.
