Version B here. It first had only 128MB, worked fine, I added 256MB, 
system become unstable, memtest86 found "bad memory" around the last 
megabytes. Then I bought 512MB, hoping to use it with 256MB - no way. 
Every module alone works, but not together. But in my case memtest86 did 
find errors. Try removing the 256MB module?...
Thanks
