And on UP builds, it may simply be best to open code an interrupt unsafe
cmpxchg and use atomic_cmpxchg unconditionally on SMP builds (which I
think generates half decent code on all SMP architectures).
Just something to think about. Of course this will require the dreaded
preempt_disable() which might make it a showstopper.
