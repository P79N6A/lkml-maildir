With 300 lines changed this is not trivial to review/apply anymore
(yeah, I sound like a broken record ;-) and since I've already applied
Paolo's patch from two days ago this one heavily rejects...
Moreover md5sum is different before/after the patch - I tried really hard
to figure out why (by reverting some changes) but finally I gave up.
Please:
- resync
- factor out changes which affect resulting binary
- resubmit
Thanks,
Bart
