Hi, any testing of the patches would be much appreciated. I don't have
access to any boxes that might have problems with running tasklets as
work queues. So if you know others with this equipment, and can pass the
patches off to them. It will hopefully help us know if this patch helps,
hurts, or just doesn't make a difference.

Well, if you put the prio of the work queue higher, it won't be any
different than a tasklet. A tasklet runs at an even higher priority than
any thread on the system.
