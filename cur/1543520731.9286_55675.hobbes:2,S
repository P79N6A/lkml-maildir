Hello guys,
I sent this patch a couple of times to the relevant maintainer (well,
Linus actually):
  
http://www.ocston.org/~tigran/patches/tswap-2.3.35.patch
but it was always rejected. As of now (and 2.2.5+ I think) a task cannot
be put to TASK_SWAPPING state, under Linux. Are there some plans to use
this state in the future or should this state really be, as Scott Maxwell
says in his famous book, "on the way out"?
Regards,
