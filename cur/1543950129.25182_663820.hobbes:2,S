... too bad this nice comment wasn't included in PATCH 2/2, so that
it would automatically make it into the record of history - the source
control log message (as best I understand how Andrew's tools work,
comments off in their own, codeless patch "PATCH 0/N" don't make
it to the source control log, except when Andrew chooses to make a
special effort.)
