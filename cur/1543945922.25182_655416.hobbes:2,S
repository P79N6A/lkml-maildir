Nack.  I don't object to un-exporting journal_update_superblock(), because
that is pretty internal, but the other functions are intended specifically
for use by code outside of JBD.  For example, the journal checksum patch for
ext3/4 uses journal_set_features() to turn on features in the JBD superblock.
Similarly, for 64-bit support in ext4 uses journal_set_features() to set
a 64-bit feature flag in the journal superblock.
Cheers, Andreas
