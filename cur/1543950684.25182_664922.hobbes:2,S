Well.  Where do we stand with this?  afaict the state of play is:
Greg: do it in udev
Pavel: but people want to run old distros in containers
Realistically, when is the mainline kernel likely to have sufficient
container functionality which is sufficiently well-tested for people to
actually be able to do that?  And how much longer will it take for that
kernel.org functionality to propagate out into non-bleeding-edge distros?
Altogether we're looking at one to three years, aren't we?  By then,
perhaps a lot of "old" distros are already udev-based.
otoh, my experience upgrading old kernels to new udev has not been a
good one (ie: it didn't work).
