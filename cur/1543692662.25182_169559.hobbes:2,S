You can even choose a toolkit that goes beyond Linux:
http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html
http://wwws.sun.com/software/star/gnome/
http://www.software.hp.com/products/GNOME/
And the same happens with Qt, I suppose.
Nowadays motif is used just for portability between Linux and other systems,
like IRIX or HPUX,
but it looks like the 'other' are moving to Gnome or KDE. So in a few years acrobat
will use gtk or qt, many oldies like xfig will be superceded by new apps,
and you real standards will be GTK and Qt.
And about interoperability, take a look at:
