Ok, I understand now.
    1. You need the child to have a valid thread descriptor immediately after
       fork(), and the parent's thread descriptor to be the same
       before and after fork().
    2. At all times, get_current_thread()->tid must return the current
       thread's tid in both the parent and child.
That is fine.  Just allocate a new TLS for the child, use
CLONE_SETTID|CLONE_CLEARTID|CLONE_SETTLS in your threaded fork(), and
pass the child's tid address (in the child's tls area).
It does require allocating a new TLS area on fork().  Is that a
problem?
