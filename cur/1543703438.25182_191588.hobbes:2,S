The IS_IOADDR() stuff in the accesor funcs in pcibr_reg.c is completly
bogus, please decide whether you want to pass a pointer to the pcibr_soft
or bridge_t to it instead of doing second-guessing.
Also while the pic.h changes look okay they will conflict with a patch
I'm about to send that adds common headers for the bridge/xbow/xwidget
register for mips and IA64.  Can you send me a version of pic.h with
those changes and the big endian ifdefs back in so I can just incorporate
the new version into my patch?
Also are all those access you abstract away different in TIOCP?  If not
please don't add the wrappers for them.
