Hi,
I first asked this question on uClinux mailing list. My first question
is <
http://mailman.uclinux.org/pipermail/uclinux-dev/2005-December/036042.html>.
Although I found this issue on uClinux, it's also can be demostrated
on Linux. This is a small program:
$> cat test2.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int
main ()
{
  char *p;
  int i, j;
  for (i = 0;; i++)
    {
      p = (char *) malloc (8 * 1024 * 1024);
      if (p)
        for (j = 0; j < 8 * 1024 * 1024; j++)
          p[j] = 0x55;
      else
        {
          printf ("%d fail\n", i);
          break;
        }
    }
  return 0;
}
When I run it on my Linux notebook, it will be killed. I expect to see
it prints out   "fail".
Thanks,
Jie

Here is very small program
$> cat test.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int
main ()
{
  char *p;
  p = (char *) malloc (32 * 1024 * 1024);
  if (p)
    printf ("sucess\n");
  else
    printf ("fail\n");
  return 0;
}
When I run it on uClinux for Blackfin (BF533-STAMP board, which has
64MB SDRAM), The first invocation of it usually prints out "fail" as
expected. But the following invocations will be killed by kernel
because out of memory. The problem is  why the second and further runs
should be killed. (The first run is not because try_to_free_pages ()
did some progress.) In these failed malloc () cases, the 32MB memory
has not been allocated. So there is no such out-of-memory case which
will make kernel cannot kill. There is no difference on the memory
consumption between this program and a program which has only an empty
main () function. Why should it be killed?
It's true that Linux can allocate memory for application, but SuSv3
also says If the space cannot be allocated, a null pointer shall be
returned. But uClinux kills this application while there is plenty of
memory just because it cannot reclaim enough pages. It's very weird.
It would be better to nicely tell application that malloc () fails.
Thanks,
Jie
