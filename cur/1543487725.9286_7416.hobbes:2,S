Its not GPL thats quite the issue here, its as Mike says a bit more
complicated. The GPL itself is quite clear and the answer is "no".
The two fun questions are
1.	Linus gave specific additional permissions to people for some binary
	modules with restrictions. Does Mosix violate his agreement with them
2.	Since Linus owns <10% of the code do his additional permissions mean
	anything anyway ?
This is perhaps a topic for gnu.* usenet groups not linux-kernel. I'll stop
here simply because its not an appropriate debate for l/k even if its a
very appropriate debate elsewhere
