Subject: CMD680 missing from 2.4.21?

Was CMD680 support forgotten in 2.4.21 or am I missing
something? In 2.4.19 and .20 I get:
CMD680: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 58
CMD680: chipset revision 1
CMD680: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0x1000-0x1007, BIOS settings: hda:pio, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0x1008-0x100f, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd:pio
in 2.4.21 it is not detected (same config). I have found
two related entries in ChangeLog:
ChangeLog-2.4.20:
Adrian Bunk <bunk@fs.tum.de>:
  o document that cmd64x.c supports the CMD649 and CMD680
ChangeLog-2.4.21:
Alan Cox <alan@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk>:
  o fix wrong clocking selection on CMD680/SII3112
