BTW, AFAIK gcc is the only large free software project that has an
explicit rule that (quote):
   * No single organization is allowed to have 50% or more of the votes.
     [This includes groups of developers from the same company or a
     university]
The cygnus/redhat merger was indeed a point where this rule had to be
checked, fortunately even redhat+cygnus is well below the 50% mark.
But even if it were true, it isn't good.
