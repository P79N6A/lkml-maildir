The time used for recascding is neither available :). Seriously, I'm
quite sure that the rbtree for the sorting of "timers" - not "timeouts"
- will not have any relevant performance impact. If there is a faster
sorted tree around, I have no problem to use that.

Sorry, all units usec.
Yes. The problem is the combined base lock, which holds off interrupts
for quite a bunch of time. Daniel was experiencing this too.

Hmm. Except for the 2timer_test, where my source seems to be broken it
works here.

Hmm, divide error. I had one of those in the early phase due to some
strange 64/32 truncation problem, which was caused by nested
inline/macros. After unmingling the problem went away.
