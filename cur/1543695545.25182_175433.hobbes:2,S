I tested it on kernel 2.4.20. If anyone else has this card and tests it I
would like to hear about it.
Changes parport_serial.c and pci_ids.h.
Todo: tell the difference between 6 ports serial and 4 ports serial and 1
parallel or other variants. If anyone has suggestions please send them to my
e-mail address
