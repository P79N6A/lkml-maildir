well, before i get even more confused by what was (once upon a time) a
fairly straightforward removal patch, the first obvious question is --
are there *any* circumstances that *require* a config selection of
CONFIG_PM_LEGACY, as opposed to a selection of APM and/or ACPI?  if
there are, then it can't simply be removed.  my original patch
submission was based on the assumption that absolutely no one needed
the legacy stuff anymore and absolutely everything related to it could
be scrapped.
so, first things first:  what *needs* legacy PM at the moment?
rday
p.s.  i'm confused by the header file include/linux/pm_legacy.h,
especially this part:
========================
#ifdef CONFIG_PM_LEGACY
...
# else /* CONFIG_PM_LEGACY */
#define PM_IS_ACTIVE() 0
...
#endif
=======================
  so the macro "PM_IS_ACTIVE()" represents whether *legacy* PM has
been selected.  in other words, it makes no (apparent) sense that the
value of that macro would represent some kind of contention mechanism
between APM and ACPI, which is entirely independent from the legacy
stuff.  right?
