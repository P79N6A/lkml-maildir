Here is your original email:

You're are stating that:
1) You "only ever care about what's seen from a HA",
2) "if you have muliple SPI cards that are on a single parallel
    bus you'll have the same bus represented twice"
3) "we have a scsi_device object for every lun
    that's seen from a hba, linked to the HBAs Scsi_Host object
    and not one shared by multiple HBAs"
So in effect, you _want_ duplication, right?  This is perfectly OK.
In fact it is desirable (and has never been under question).
This isn't directly related to the RFC.  The RFC basically
outlines the result of *a SAS discovery process*.  The discovery
process/LLDD can register the LU many times.  This has *never* been an
issue of discussion.
Your concern is satisfied in that, /sys/bus/scsi/devices/... would
point to the LU.  And a link from /sys/class/sas_ha/ha0/devices/
to the LU could be placed (outside the scope of this RFC).  The RFC
doesn't mention LUs, but they could be included if you wish so.
