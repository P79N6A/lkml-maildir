This has nothing to do with the patch fixing serial drivers, to which
you seem to have replied. Please don't reply to random messages -- if
you mean to starting a new thread then do so properly.

Whether you use the new type of pseudo-ttys /dev/pts/XX or whether you
use the old ones is dependent on your user space programs. You should be
using /dev/pts/XX. If you _are_, then the number of available
pseudo-ttys is indeed part of the kernel configuration. It's
CONFIG_UNIX98_PTY_COUNT.
