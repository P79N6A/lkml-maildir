I like the idea of capping max commands based on the number of arrays. One problem is that we can add or remove a logical drive during runtime. How would Linux handle us reshuffling the max commands for each queue?

The easiest thing to do may be to take your patch #1, and then add code 
to clamp the per-queue outstanding-command (tag) depth to
	1024 / n_arrays_found
at initialization time.  Or perhaps s/n_arrays_found/max_arrays_per_hba/
I bet that's just a few additional lines of code, and should work...
