How does this interact with the virtual scanning stuff? I
was under the impression that we scanned for suitable pages
on a per-process basis ... so I'm confused as to how you'd
have a per-node kswapd without rmap's physical scanning
(unless you assume all processes on a node have all their
mem on that node). Could you explain?

I'd certainly be interested to see / try it - I think Bill Irwin
had an implementation of multiple kswapd's for rmap - you might
want to look at that before you port.
Thanks,
