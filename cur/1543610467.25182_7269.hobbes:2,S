AFAIK the .journal it's visible only when you convert an ext2 to an ext3
filesystem on a mounted partition, it was a problem with 2.4.10 kernel
version, but i'm not sure if posterior releases also show this behavior.
Anyway you can solve it recreating a new journal (remount it to ext2
before doing this):
'chattr -i /.journal;rm /.journal;tune2fs -j /dev/whatever'
