i have some more updated information for this.  It seems that linux is
generating a duplicate transaction ID in the udp header in the dns query
when making a dns request.  This piece seems to be what is preventing
the Firewall from distinguishing unique dns requests.  It sees a second
DNS request come from the linux server with the _same_ transaction ID in
the UDP header as it is marking that session closed since it already saw
the reply successfully.  So for example the linux server is making a dns
query with DNS Transaction ID 0x598d, then a response comes back with ID
0x598d, and then another query gets sent out with ID 0x598d.  When that
second response comes back, the firewall gets confused b/c it is in the
middle of closing the original 0x598d session and thus drops the packet,
causing a DNS timeout.
 Why is linux generating a redundant transaction ID in the dns header
here?  The first 2 requests have incremented values, but then for some
reason the third seems to have the same value which is causing issues. 
Has anyone encountered this behavior?
thanks again
adam
