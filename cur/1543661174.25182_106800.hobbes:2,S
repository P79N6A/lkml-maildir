a. Supposedly a good ham can pick one signal from many,
   at least if the pitches are different.
b. If you're not a good ham, you can process the audio.
   There are existing decoders that might do the job.
   This works for 1 computer if you have a tape recorder.
Using fast Morse over the speaker, an oops may take
30 minutes.
Blinking keyboard LEDs would have to be much slower.
The data would have to be just an instruction pointer.
Using a non-Morse code over the speaker could get the
transmission time down to a couple minutes, with full
ASCII and error correction.
Say, anybody have a *.wav file of machine-room noise?
(16-bit, 44.1 and 48 kHz)
