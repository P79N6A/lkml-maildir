Sorry for the confusion.
For swap prefetch I should have said "some people claim that it fix
their problem". I didn't want to hurt anybody feelings, some people are
tired to hear others speak hypothetically about this patch, as it
work-for-them (TM).
I don't experience the problem. Can't help.
For drop behind it fix half the problem. The read case is handled
perfectly by Peter's patch. And the copy (read+write) is unchanged. My
test case demonstrate it very easily, just look at the numbers.
So, I agree with you that drop behind doesn't fix the write() case.
Peter has said so himself when I offered to test his patch.
As I do experience this problem, I have written a small test program and
batch file to help push the patch for acceptance.  I'm very willing to
help improve the test cases, test patches and write code, time
permitting.
About this very subject, earlier this year this Andrew suggested me to
came up with a test case to demonstrate my problem, well finally I've
done so.

Lastly, I would go as far to say that the use-once read then copy fix
must also work with copies over NFS. I don't know if NFS change the
workload on the client station versus the local case, and I don't know
if it's still possible to consider data copied this way as use-once.
