Sure, I still use a 486 with linux for some jobs, but I am realistic
about what I can expect from that level of hardware.

True, although I would think anyone doing actual work on that kind of
data size would be using fairly new hardware anyhow.
If you have to write all sorts of complex algorithms to work around a
limitation in your current hardware, perhaps it is cheaper to buy newer
hardware without that limitation.  Ofcourse if you are working on things
in your spare time for free, then hardware upgrades are always the most
expensive solution.
