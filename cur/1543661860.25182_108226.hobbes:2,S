I'm confused. I looked below the text of my mail which you had quoted,
but couldn't see that you'd actually added anything new in response. Did
you hit 'Send' too soon?
By the way, your mail directly to me ended up in the spam bin because it
had no References: or In-Reply-To: headers to correctly identify the
mail to which you were replying.
