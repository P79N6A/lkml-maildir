Thank you. I've been thinking hard about this for some time. I hope it becomes 
useful

irman isn't really the key to this benchmark, it was only the source of a
constant load in each different area. The actual irman app isn't used, only the
child load apps.

I've had a look at tiobench and it looks like a serious IO load. However the
load varies quite a bit and I'd like something that remains relatively constant
throughout. I'd have to strip the guts out of it and do it as numerous different
IO tests. It does start taking away from the simplicity of it at the moment, and
as you can see from the numbers, it is still very revealing in it's current
incarnation.

Thanks for that. I've managed to get the keyboard working but haven't been up to
speed with development of 2.5.x so I haven't figured out what to do about the
changing IDE partitions. All of that is moot at the moment, though, as my
benchmark won't yet work on 2.5.x because of changes to the /proc filesystem.
Rik Van Riel is helping me sort out this problem.
In the meantime I have created a tarball of this benchmark in a usable form.
I've called it contest (thanks Rik for the name idea) and it's basically a
script and the relevant workload tasks. I've posted it on my kernel page at
http://kernel.kolivas.net
 under the FAQ. A final reminder note: it won't work on
2.5.x
