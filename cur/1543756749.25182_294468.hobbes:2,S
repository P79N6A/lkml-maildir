No, provide two different functions.  In a header file make it a static
inline function that does nothing if this option is not selected, so as
to make the code just go away, and the call is never made.

How is there a path for a kobject that is never registered with sysfs?
I agree with Andrew, why are you using a kobject for this?  Have you
looked at the "connector" code that is in the -mm tree?  That might be a
better solution for this, and it will be going into the kernel tree
after 2.6.11 is released.

EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() for something like this please.
