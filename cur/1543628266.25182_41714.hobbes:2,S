In any case, I just re-verified: "halt -p", as root, from the command line, 
takes the machine down to the "Power down" message, parks the hard drive, but 
leaves the rest of the system on.  This is on both a linux from scratch 
system and a Red Hat system, both of which have been known to power down 
before (with a different kernel).
It still might be my .config, although a config that produces a kernel that 
powers down for suspend but won't power down on halt, on three radically 
different systems (dell, toshiba, sis)...
I'll thump on it some more later.
