The only thing that I can think of that can go wrong here is what kind
of effect it would have on the thread write blocking against a bunch of
RCU readers. It could introduce a chain of delays into, say, a timer event
and might cause problems/side-effects for other things being processed.
RCU processing might have to decoupled processed by a different thread
to avoid some of that latency weirdness.
What do you folks think ?
