I've had to turn my attention to some other responsibilities, so I haven't
done any kernel profiling yet.  However, I can report that I rebooted
'mist' into 2.4.20 yesterday, and I have seen rock solid .15 ms response
times for more than 24 hours.  Host 'must' is likewise now stable, running
2.4.20 for two days now.  I have graphs, logs, etc. if anyone cares to see
them.
mist is hyperthreaded dual xeon now back to built-in broadcom adapter (tg3
module).  must is single cpu asus p4pe w/ 3com adapter.
