Actually, the man page does not say anything about the behavior across
suspends, and ...
      CLOCK_REALTIME
              System-wide  realtime clock.  Setting this clock requires appro-
              priate privileges.
       CLOCK_MONOTONIC
              Clock that cannot be set and  represents  monotonic  time  since
              some unspecified starting point.
I'd understand both those wordings the same way!  Well, I suppose
"cannot be set" means that at least humans can't willingly interfere with
it, but maybe something else can.

"Monotonic" means "always goes in the same direction", not "never
skips".
