Bah. It doesn't matter. It's an ABI. Your arguments make no sense - simply 
because there are other differences that means that if you develop under 
one OS, you can't expect it to run on another.
Arguing that "accident" is somehow different than "extension" is a totally 
inane and _idiotic_ argument. Because it's just arguing about the words, 
not about the end result.
If you're doing a dissertation in English literature, arguing about the 
words you use is valid. But if you're talking about operating systems, 
it's just pointless masturbation.
