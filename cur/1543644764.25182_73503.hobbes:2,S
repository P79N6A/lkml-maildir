What about page table sharing? Does anybody still care about this?
The patch from Daniel Phillips
(
http://www.geocrawler.com/mail/msg.php3?msg_id=7855063&list=35
)
is a few month old and I can't see any progress.
Sorry, I'm not a kernel expert, so I can't help.
But page table sharing is still listed as betaware at the
Linux Kernel 2.5 Status page (
http://kernelnewbies.org/status/latest.html
)
and Page Table sharing isn't marked post Halloween.
Some comments from Daniel Phillips or Dave McCracken?
