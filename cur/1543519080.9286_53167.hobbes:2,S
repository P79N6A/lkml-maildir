I am working on porting the SGI crash tools to Alpha. Since the CPU registers
aren't available from within the panic() call, I need to grab them directly.
How do I do this? The equivalent i386 code is:
        /* save the dump specific esp/eip */
        /* For Alpha, save PC (Program Counter) and RA */
        __asm__ __volatile__("
                pushl %%eax\n
                movl  %%esp, %%eax\n
                movl  %%eax, %0\n
                popl  %%eax\n"
                : "=g" (dump_header.dh_esp)
        );
        __asm__ __volatile__("pushl  %eax\n");
        __dump_save_panic_regs();
        __asm__ __volatile__("popl   %eax\n");
Pointers to online resources are greatly welcomed also.
