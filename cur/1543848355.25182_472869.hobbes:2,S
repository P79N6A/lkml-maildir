No it didn't.  It's undefined behaviour to perform *any* PCI config
access to the device while it's doing a D-state transition.  It may have
happened to work with the chips you tried it with, but more likely you
never hit that window because X simply didn't try to do that.

Indeed.  Only now we have software producing it, rather than hardware
producing it.  That's actually an improvement I think, since it forces
awareness of the issue.
