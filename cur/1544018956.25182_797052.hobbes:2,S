Thanks, will do.

How can I get some code executed during the initialization of the IP
stack which initializes the table, before any sk_buff gets allocated?
The content is constant, but writing it down as static initializers
using just preprocessor macros would be difficult and/or ugly - that's
why I haven't done it already.
