Subject: [OOPS] 2.3.22 boots but very unstable

	this is on a thinkpad, apm, no pci, ps2, no pcmcia, basically
	plain.
	no certain way to reproduce, just use the box for a while then
	oops or hard lock up.
	i've seen this oops before other oops, so i guess this must be
	the cause (unless there's another one above it, wouldn't know
	i tried with 80x60 vc).
	2.3.19 was fine on this machine (had 10 days uptime). i just
	upgrade binutils to 2.9.5.0.16, but i guess if it boots then
	there's no problem with it, is it?
bad magic c03ebf98 (should be c03ebf68), wq bug, forcing oops.

	i don't have sysklogd, so i looked up the table by hand but forget
	if it should be the closest address, the name below the address,
	or the one after. so i include both, symbol with address lower
	than the call trace address, and the one with higher (respective)
