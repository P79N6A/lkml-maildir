Which, happily, is what already happens and why it works fine when you
just do -dev=/dev/hdX. What should be removed is the warning that
cdrecord spits out when you do this, and the whole ATAPI thing should
just mirror ATA and scsi-linux-ata be killed completely.
So I suggest you do that instead and send it to Joerg, cdrecord/cdrtool
patches are off topic here.
