    The real big problem is that the WIN95 workaround isnt a mount option.
But it is. The bug is that the kernel has a CONFIG_SMB_WIN95
that overrules the mount option. Just delete all mention of CONFIG_SMB_WIN95
from the kernel source (that is, from fs/Config.in, fs/smbfs/inode.c
and Documentation/Configure.help, Documentation/filesystems/smbfs.txt)
and all will be well.
