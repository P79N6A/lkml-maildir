Sorry for not being clear.
I meant scaling with regard to lots of different keys.
This is what you have described as "By 'rows'", isn't it?
For example, if I wanted to store a timestamp for each request
issued, and there were lots of devices and the I/O was driving
the system crazy - how would affect that lookup time?
I would use, say, the address of struct request as key. I would
store the start time of a request there. Once a requests completes
I would look up the start time and calculate a latency.
I would be done with that lookup table entry then.
But it won't go away, will it? Is this an issue?

Right, I have gone off on a tangent - systemtap, just one out of many
likely exploiters of markers.
Anyway, I think this discussion shows that any dynamically added client
of kernel markers which needs to hold extra data for entities like
requests might be difficult to be implemented efficiently (compared
to static instrumentation), because markers, by nature, only allow
for code additions, but not for additions to existing data structures.
