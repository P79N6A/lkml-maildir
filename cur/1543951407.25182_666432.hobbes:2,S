I guess I'm being really vicious to them: I expose it to customers and
the real world.
My own servers also have uptimes of >400 days sometimes, and I wonder
what customers do to the poor things.
And yes, I'm not saying I don't see your point for specialised
deployments (filesystems which are easy to rebuild from scratch), but
transactional integrity is a requirement I'd rank really high on the
desirable list of features if I was you.

Where they control the hardware and run a rather specialized OS as well,
not a general purpose system like Linux on "commodity" hardware ;-)

Ok, I see.

I'm afraid with those properties it doesn't really meet my needs :-(
And, wouldn't a simpler way to achieve something similar not be to use
the plain Linux fs caching/buffers, just disabling forced write out
maybe via a mount option? This strikes me as similar to the effect I get
from remounting NFS (a)sync. Make the fs ignore fsync et al.
It would have the advantage of using all memory available for caching
and not otherwise requested, too. (And, of course, the downside of
making it hard to reserve cache space for a given fs explicitly, at
least now. But I'm sure the control group / container folks would love
that feature. ;-)
