sum(sg) == rq->data_len is already broken; sg sends such requests
(though it would be nice if it doesn't).
I've not followed the earlier discussion (because I thought the drain
buffer stuff affected only libata but seems it doesn't ...). Why did
we need to change the meaning of rq->data_len?
rq->data_len meant the true data length and the patch to change it
doesn't look to make anything simple. Can we revert the meaning of
rq->data_len? I'm not sure that we need to add rq->extra_len but it's
fine as long as it's only for drivers that want to use it.
This is only compile tested.
