1) Try booting with 'acpi=off'. It's broken for a number of systems
(does precisely what you've described) and no official update is
available as of yet. Alternatively, you can try to apply the most
recent ACPI patch from [1].
2) Make sure you've enabled core input support and userland keyboard
interface (CONFIG_INPUT, CONFIG_INPUT_KEYBDEV).
