Why can't we get this obvious compiler bug fixed?  I'd rather have
the compiler bug fixed rather than trying to work around the bogus
warning.
It's obvious that the loop:
	for (try = 0; try < 3; try++)
is going to be executed at least once, which will initialise quot.
As for the second hunk, its correct in so far as it'll catch the case
where we can't even do 9600 baud.  However, I think we should just
bound the lowest baud rate such that we can always do 9600 baud (and
therefore this function will never return zero.)
