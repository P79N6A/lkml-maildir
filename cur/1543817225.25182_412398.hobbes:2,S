Sometimes.
I have customers that use Pathscale, Intel, and Portland
groups compilers.
Not all of them use the C compilers (Some just use the F90
compilers), but a number of them do use the C compiler, though
I would be that most of the applications are not going to care
about doing much against anything but standard ANSI C calls.
