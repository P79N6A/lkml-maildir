If any of these CONFIG_ options are always derived (i.e. the user never
sees them on a config menu) then please add the suffix _DERIVED to such
options.  They still need to start with CONFIG_ to suit the kernel
build dependency generator so we cannot change the start of the name.
Appending _DERIVED will make it obvious that the options require no
help text.
