He said in his original email that it was a USB SmartMedia reader,
which reads the SmartMedia cards used with FujiFilm digital cameras
(amongst others). The actual file system is determined by the cards
themselves and can't be changed.
I have a Fuji MX2700 digital camera myself, and a separate USB reader
for downloading it to computer (the inbuilt serial link is far too
slow), but I'm in the position that the only USB enabled computer in
the household is my wife's one which only runs Win98, and can't be
changed without incurring my wife's severe displeasure. As a result,
I'm not able to test anything USB out.
Best wishes from Riley.
