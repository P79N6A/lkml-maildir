Sorry, this patch didn't fix our performance problems.  Mary just
finished running dbt2 on test8 with your patch:
NOTPM   kernel          scheduler
965     2.6.0-test8-np  AS
1632    2.6.-test6-mm4  deadline
This is an 8-way system with DAC960 and 12 LUNs, using raw devices.
That's still quite a sizeable drop.
