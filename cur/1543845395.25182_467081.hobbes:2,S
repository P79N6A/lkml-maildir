I encountered a similar bug, but a lot earlier. It seems to be a locking
problem, as it is lockdep which does the BUG() for me.
It's also an SMP machine in my case, acpi_os_wait_semaphore() is in the
call chain, too. No textual output (no serial connection attached, too
early for netconsole), but a screenshot:

2.6.18 works for me, newer git versions explode.
Maybe it's an SMP-related problem, but it does BUG() before initialization
of the second CPU.
