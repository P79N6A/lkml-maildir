it fixed 2 sparse warnings:
drivers/usb/storage/initializers.c:83:26: warning: incorrect type in argument 5 (different signedness)
drivers/usb/storage/initializers.c:83:26:    expected unsigned int *act_len
drivers/usb/storage/initializers.c:83:26:    got int *<noident>
drivers/usb/storage/initializers.c:89:26: warning: incorrect type in argument 5 (different signedness)
drivers/usb/storage/initializers.c:89:26:    expected unsigned int *act_len
drivers/usb/storage/initializers.c:89:26:    got int *<noident>
After you pointed out that I should include warnings in patch description,
I've sent this:
