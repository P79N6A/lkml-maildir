One doesn't typically experience scalability problems per se. One
rather compares slopes of scaling lines and notes relative scaling
across kernels, be they versions of the same kernel or different
codebases altogether. It's still possible to have scalability
problems, of course, where things basically slowdown severely or
appear to stop entirely.
Nonlinear scalability is generally considered to be where the limits
of scaling set in. There is usually linear scaling until some number
of processors, and then the limit is where the linearity breaks down.
Linear scalability is defined as adding resources (e.g. cpus) to the
system resulting in a linear increase in performance.
To characterize a kernel's scalability, one should say three things:
(1) workload/benchmark
(2) linear scaling coefficient
(3) upper limit on linearity
So you would say that when running dbench, Linux scales with a
coefficient of 0.85 up to 78 processors or similar.
