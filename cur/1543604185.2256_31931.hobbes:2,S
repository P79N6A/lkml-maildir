Yes and No. ;-)
Robert have a look at the direct comparisons of dual 1.2 GHz Athlon TB and 
1.2 GHz Athlon MP. There are many flowting around. The Palomino core 
enhancements are even at the same chip clock very good for SMP.

They don't have issues but they are (much) slower in dual configurations for 
specific test cases.

The differences _are_ easily shown.
So the Athlon XP (Palomino core) _IS_ the way to go...8-)
