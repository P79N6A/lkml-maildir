Complex layer?! It's an array with free slots chained by a double linked

And look at what you're describing here, talking about simplicity. You'd 
still need two bitmaps, so you'd still need the out-of-fdmap.c/h code. 
You're trying to fit an horse-shoe to a deer :)
The most appropriate structure for this, is an array (O(1) lookup) with 
free elements chained by a dbl linked list (O(1) alloc and free). Plus, 
the extra pointer can nicely fit other per-allocated-fd flags w/out adding 
extra custom flags bitmaps to the fdtable.
