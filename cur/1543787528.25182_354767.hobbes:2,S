Linus,
I have to tip my hat to you sir.
As much as I wanted to believe and tried to make it happen ... ATA/IDE was
forced to design many exception case events.  Regardless how hard I an
others tried to invoke/create a driver to mimic the "SPEC", the hardware
people broke most of the rules and each chipset was littered with
exception cases.
It has been 7 years since you and I started butting heads, and in the end
both of us were right.  A driver could be written to follow the standard
exactly, and it would never work (alone, as-is) because the hardware was
not paying attention the rules book.
Hope you can kick back and laugh about the history, too!
Have a great Day!
