Resolved.
I just looked at what the kernel did whne compiling a module that 
exported some symbols, and discovered that I needed
to set CFLAGS to:
-D__KERNEL__ -I$/usr/src/linux)  -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes \
-O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe \
-DMODULE  -DMODVERSIONS -include \
/usr/src/linux/modversions.h
Now all works correctly, and I can load my modules.
Thanks for all your help.
eps. the tip when I try to compile it in the kernel tree.
