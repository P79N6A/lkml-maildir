Okay, below is the XFree log file.  It is truncated at the point where
the oops occurs.  I sent an e-mail to Andrew confirming that backing out
sysfs-class-10-vc.patch fixes the problem for me.

The VT number it tries to use jumps around.  Sometimes it is VT10, VT11,
etc.  It should be using VT7 however.
