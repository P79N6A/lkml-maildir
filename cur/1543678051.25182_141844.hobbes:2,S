Subject: init_thread_union really needed by modules?

Is it really necessary for init_thread_union to be exported to
modules?  If not, would you mind applying the attached patch.  (We
haven't exported the symbol on ia64 for ages, with no apparent ill
effects.)
Furthermore, if this patch can be applied, we should be able to make
the init_thread_union local to arch/ARCH/kernel/init_task.c and
that in turn would let us remove its declaration from
include/linux/sched.h alltogether (i.e., no more ugly #ifdefs).
Thanks,
