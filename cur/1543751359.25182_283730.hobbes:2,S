Yes, we've been talking about a usbfs2 for a long time now, but no one
has stepped up and done the work.  It would look a lot like gadgetfs,
which only has a limited number of ioctls needed for its operation.
But I don't see where the problem is unique to usbfs here, don't we
properly use the 32->64bit ioctl conversion code to solve this kind of
issue?  Are we using it incorrectly?
