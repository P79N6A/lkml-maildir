Note: I said: ".. if send_head points to skb and skb->len is
		  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
zero and we are running in such slow path ..".
If send_head doesn't point to skb then it is before it (and it cannot
advance under us of course because we hold the sock lock) and so in such
case we didn't clobbered the send_head at all in skb_entail, and so we
don't need to touch send_head in order to undo (we only need to unlink).
See?
