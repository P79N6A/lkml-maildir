I am trying convince someone to do it for me, since I'm working on new 
controller support ATM ;-)
It shouldn't be hard -- just a new function "ata_scsi_passthru_xlat" 
that translates the 04-262r<n>.pdf opcode into struct ata_taskfile. 
That's all that's needed for Step One.
John mentioned he might look at it...  but why don't you guys (and 
everyone else interested) just work publicly on linux-ide?  Share the 
knowledge and patches :)
