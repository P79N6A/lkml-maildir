They already increase by 32bits on IA64.  A driver should use a
fixed sized type for a fixed sized address that corresponds to its
capabilities.  There is no guarantee of the size of dma_addr_t.
It is opaque and should be able to represent all dma (or I would prefer
bus) addresses in the system.  The examples I've seen where people
assume it to be 32bits in size are, well, broken.
