Subject: swapping slow downs in 2.2.1

i'm running a 2.2.1 kernel on a P166 with 16MB of memory, and two swaps,
40MB on a partition and another 10MB on a filesystem.
I use Gnome 1.0(with gtk-themes)+Enlightenment snapshot regulary, and they
often take up to 30-40MB of swap, and i must say the performance is
amazing, especially if you compare it to a windows machine.
however, after a few days, thing seem to slow down, paging takes much more
time, and even restarting X does not seem to help.
however, if i make swapoff -a, and then swapon -a, the system become fast
again.
is it a bug, or is it a feature?
