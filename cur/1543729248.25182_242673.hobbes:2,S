(Whoops, this generated quite some traffic while I was asleep.
I'll just comment on some of the posts in a single mail.)

Yep. I think that's the way to go.

No, it's not "now" which is wandering, but the difference between "uptime"
and "time_from_boot_to_process_start". The former gets corrected by ntp,
while the latter is computed from "jiffies" and thus uncorrected.

No, we already fixed jiffies64_to_clock_t() by using TICK_NSEC instead of
HZ.

No, proc_pid_stat() indeed gives a constant. But userspace somehow has to
figure out what a value in "jiffies" means. Since "jiffies" started from 
zero
at boot time, "uptime" is needed for that. However, we "fixed" uptime to
get corrected by ntp, so that userspace now has a drifting notion of 
"jiffies".

No, that's not needed anymore. We've already started to account for the
difference, e.g. by using TICK_NSEC in jiffies64_to_clock_t().
Problem is, we are only halfway through the attempt to remove the use
of "jiffies" as a clock, so currently to incompatible time sources get 
mixed
up.
The other problem seems to be that this move away from "jiffies" seems to
happen on an ad-hoc basis whenever we encounter a problem, rather than
with a big picture in mind.
John Stultz once laid out a concept for a (coordinated) rewrite in 2.7,
and I think this still is a good idea.
