1. although the initrd is a nice hack, I generally
avoid all that and compile all the requirements of
the root file system into the kernel -
2. everything else, I generally compile as modular.
this is extremely helpful in troubleshooting, e.g.
you can load/unload drivers without a reboot.
3. It doesn't hurt to have modules compiled for
cards you don't need, since they will not be
loaded. However, you want to avoid the opposite
scenario - not having the driver you need.
4. the defaults are usually sane, but look at
each and every one the first time you do a
kernel config.
5. DO NOT simply blow away your old kernel -
you will be sorry if you do. leave the old kernel
intact as a fallback, and make the necessary
edits to lilo, grub or whatever boot manager
you are using.
