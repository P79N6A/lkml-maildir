It all depends on what we mean by "per-cpu state".  If we were to remember
that "CPU 7 needs 0x1234 in register 44" then that would be wrong.  But
remembering some high-level functional thing like "CPU 7 needs to run the
NMI watchdog" is fine.  The CPU bringup code can work out whether that is
possible, and how to do it.
