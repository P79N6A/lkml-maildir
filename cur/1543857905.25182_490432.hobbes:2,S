Have you actually seen this, or is this just from looking at code?
Quite frankly, if "pipe_mnt" is ever NULL, we're dead for lots of other 
reasons. 
In fact, pipe_mnt can't be NULL. The way it is initialized is:
	pipe_mnt = kern_mount(&pipe_fs_type);
and pipe_mnt doesn't even return NULL - it returns an error pointer, so if 
"kern_mount()" were to have failed, pipe_mnt will be some random invalid 
pointer that could only be tested with IS_ERR(), not by comparing against 
NULL.
But more fundamentally - we might as well oops. We need to panic or oops 
or do _something_ bad at some point anyway, because it's MUCH better to 
fail spectacularly than it would be to just silently fail without a pipe.
Hmm?
