Oh, you are right. local_lock_* are functions to manipulate "local wait"
spin-lock variety that was introduced by some other
patch. batch-mark_page_accessed patch worked only because all references
to local_lock_* functions were removed by pvec-cleanup patch.
Another proof of the obvious fact that manually coded pagevec iteration
is evil. :)
