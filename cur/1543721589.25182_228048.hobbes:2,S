           Summary: Aironet 340 PCMCIA card not working since 2.6.7
    Kernel Version: 2.6.7
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: rmk@arm.linux.org.uk
         Submitter: hadmut@danisch.de
Distribution: Debian
Hardware Environment: Dell Inspiron 3800, Cisco
  Aironet 340 PCMCIA card
Software Environment:
  Debian
Problem Description:
The system was working well with 
2.4.x and 2.6.x kernels up to 2.6.6.
After upgrade to 2.6.7 the WLAN does n
not work anymore: There is no error message, 
no warning, everything looks fine, except
for the fact that traffic is not possible.
Maybe a WEP problem?
regards
Hadmut
