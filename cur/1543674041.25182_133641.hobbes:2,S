Not true for network cards. Somebody might be running NFS
over it. The problem is that you cannot tell (or rather shouldn't - it's
a layering violation).
Anything that is used for paging needs to be back to life before
you can think about resurrecting user space.
Also you need to bring keyboards back to life early to make
sysreq work.
Secondly, you need a way to get essential devices to work in
all cases. If you implement it, why not use it?

Is supposed to. You cannot put blind trust into that. You need to use
a pretty arbitrary timeout to deal with this.
I fail to see technical improvements here.
