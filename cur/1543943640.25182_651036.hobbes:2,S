Hm, you've just taken a warning and elevated it to a bug.
According to the C standard, a constant has the shortest type (>= int) 
needed to hold the constant, and the warning above is somewhat bogus in 
that context (what version of gcc is that, anyway?)
ULL is only appropriate to 32-bit machines, or there will be other 
issues downstream.  The Right Way[TM] to do this would be to get Linux 
to have the [U]INTxx_C() macros from C99.
