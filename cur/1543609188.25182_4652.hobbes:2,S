Is that TOC save and restore just for module code or does it apply to
all calls through function pointers?
On IA64, R1 (global data pointer) must be saved and restored on all
calls through function pointers, even if both the caller and callee are
in the kernel.  You might know that this is a kernel to kernel call but
gcc does not so it has to assume the worst.  This is not a module
problem, it affects all indirect function calls.
