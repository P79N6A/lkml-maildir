	2.4.18 did upgrade the driver from 0.06f to 0.09b. The bug
with 0.09b is a race condition in Tx code. This was fixed in version
0.11.
	Have you tried 2.4.19-pre8-acX (well, I mean the Orinoco
driver in 2.4.19-pre8 ;-). It contains the new version of the driver
(v11) that fixes the race condition (but introduce the potential COR
problem).
	If 2.4.19-pre8-acX fails, that would be for an entirely
different reason (even if the failure might look similar).

	I'll defer that to David.
