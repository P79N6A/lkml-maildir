If someone really cares, /proc/self/fd can help. But one shouldn't care at all.
About the things that the process can do before execing() a process, file 
descriptors outside of 0,1,2 are the most obvious thing, but you also have 
alarm(), or stupid rlimits.

I want to change nothing. Current situation is fine and well documented, thank 
you.
If a program does "for (i = 0; i < NR_OPEN; i++) close(i);", this 
*will*/*should* work as intended : close all files descriptors from 0 to 
NR_OPEN. Big deal.
But you wont find in a program :
FILE *fp = fopen("somefile", "r");
for (i = 0; i < NR_OPEN; i++)
     close(i);
while (fgets(buff, sizeof(buff), fp)) {
}
You and/or others want to add fd namespaces and other hacks.
I saw on this thread suspicious examples, I am waiting for a real one, 
justifying all this stuff.
After file descriptors separation, I guess we'll need memory space separation 
as well, signal separations (SIGALRM comes to mind), uid/gid separation, cpu 
time separation, and so on... setrlimit() layered for every shared lib.
