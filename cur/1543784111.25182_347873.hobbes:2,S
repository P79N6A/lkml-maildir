Ahem, but let me note before somebody else does: it isn't interrupt context, 
it is normal process context - while an interrupt can ignore most of the 
thread_info fields, a normal process has to worry about all 9.  To be on the 
safe side, the first 8 need to be copied into and out of the ndis stack, with 
preempt disabled until after the stack switch.

Daniel
