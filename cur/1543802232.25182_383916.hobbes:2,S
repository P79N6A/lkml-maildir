The episode where I blew through half the tapes was mostly my fault.  I
can avoid that in the future while still doing destructive testing, so
you don't have to be too reluctant to give me things to test.  I just
wanted to make sure there was no further utility in getting oopses from
Linus's patch.
And try_direct_io=0 works just fine, and doesn't seem to have any
performance impact or anything, so at this point I'm not losing any
sleep.
Thanks,
