Ok, I just downloaded -ac9.
Hmm.
What about removing -16 instead of increasing it to 64?
The slab allocator is perfect for power of 2 allocations!
The slab descriptors are stored outside in seperate buffers.
And why KMALLOC_SIZE/2?
"Keep 2 messages in ..."?
Btw, sock_alloc_send_skb() (net/core.c) still uses the wrong allocation
mode for "size":
GFP_BUFFER both sleeps and uses the atomic queue.
skb = alloc_skb(size, sk->allocation & (~__GFP_WAIT));
