But the main problem with this is, when do we start deleting the HAVE_
symbols?  After a relativly short period of time, they become useless,
as all kernels of the past year or two have that feature, and why even
test for it?
I agree, that for short term, vendor-patched kernels, it's nice to have
something like that to try to build your out-of-the-tree module.  But
move to get that module into the tree, or provide your favorite vendor
with the properly patched driver (hey, I can dream...)
And is the alternative (using autoconf to build tiny modules testing for
different features) that ugly?  Yeah, I hate autoconf too, but I thought
that work (kernel feature testing in autoconf) has already been done,
right?

I'm not trying to sabotage anything, I just don't want the maintaince of
a zillion HAVE_ macros to slowly overrun us until we drown under the
weight.  All to support some looney, ill-informed vendor that can never
get around to submitting their driver to mainline.
And as for that "policy", it's been stated in public by Andrew and
Linus and me (if I count for anything, doubtful...) a number of
documented times.
