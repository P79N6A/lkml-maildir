Rather than adding yet another system call, shouldn't this be done by
extending the cpu part of sysfs (or /proc)?
It looks like the operations in sys_vperfctr could be easily mapped to a
RAM based file system.  As it stands it reminds me of one of the old DEC
graphic libraries with one API entry for all the operations, and 65
different flag values.
