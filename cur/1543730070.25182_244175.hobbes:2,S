Takashi Iwai's 'Writing an ALSA driver' (google for it) is IMHO the
exemplar in this area.  It is written at *exactly* the right level.
Several major vendors have come on alsa-devel and posted to the effect
that they followed this guide and have their driver 99% working, they
just need help with this or that, someone answers a question or two, and
bang, one more Linux-supported device.  There should be a document of
this quality covering every major category of driver.
