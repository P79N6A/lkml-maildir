Hi
I've a problem with this module. For some reason it locks up my laptop
when modprobed. I'm running redhat's 2.4.7-10 on an i686 and i'm using
the neomagic 256 chipset which I believe is a graphics/sound combination
(with 4 meg or so of mem), the comp is a dell latitude ls.
The card does work, as it runs under the commercial oss drivers, thing
is because the machine locks tight running the kernel 256_audio, I can't
get any debug information, the machine has to be physically
unplugged/debatteried (lucky I run ext3 :) Not even a messages error. 
Anyone with any info? I'm gonna have a look and try to debug, but i'm no
kernel hacker.
Thks
