Hi everybody,
I had some trouble to find out which patch is meant by
"use-menuconfig-objects-ii-sound.patch"
Just could not identify it.
So I reverted the following patches of 2.6.22-rc2-mm1:
--- linux-2.6.22-rc2/sound/Kconfig	2007-05-19 02:24:08.000000000 -0700
+++ devel/sound/Kconfig	2007-05-22 21:03:24.000000000 -0700
AND:
--- linux-2.6.22-rc2/sound/drivers/Kconfig	2007-04-25 23:42:23.000000000 -0700
+++ devel/sound/drivers/Kconfig	2007-05-22 21:03:24.000000000 -0700
Result:
The Alsa architecture is performing excellently!
Cheers
Uwe
So at least one of them should be ripeed out for being buggy.
