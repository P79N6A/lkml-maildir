Your suggestion makes a ton of sense to me, however it would be
interesting to try and apply a patch like this to my Gigabit Ethernet
test boxes and see if it makes a difference (note. Ingo's per-cpu slab
cache fix showed a significant improvement). I you do a patch I'd love
to test it, otherwise I shall try to see if I can find the time to
implement it and bench it (been back for a week and still trying to
catch up on email).
