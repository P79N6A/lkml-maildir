Subject: [PATCH]: x86_64: Remove unnecessary cast in prefetch()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

It is ok to call prefetch() function with NULL argument, as specifically
commented in include/linux/prefetch.h.  But in standard C, it is invalid to
dereference NULL pointer (see C99 standard 6.5.3.2 paragraph 4 and note #84).
Newer gcc versions (4.3 and above) will use that to conclude that "x"
argument is non-null and thus wreaking havok everywhere prefetch() was inlined.
Fixed by removing cast and changing asm constraint.
This can be fixed better by using gcc's __builtin_prefetch().
