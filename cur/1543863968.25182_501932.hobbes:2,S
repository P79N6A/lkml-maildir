Argh.  These surely get all tangled up with the
make-zones-optional-by-adding-zillions-of-ifdef patches:
deal-with-cases-of-zone_dma-meaning-the-first-zone.patch
introduce-config_zone_dma.patch
optional-zone_dma-in-the-vm.patch
optional-zone_dma-in-the-vm-no-gfp_dma-check-in-the-slab-if-no-config_zone_dma-is-set.patch

optional-zone_dma-for-ia64.patch
remove-zone_dma-remains-from-parisc.patch
remove-zone_dma-remains-from-sh-sh64.patch
set-config_zone_dma-for-arches-with-generic_isa_dma.patch
zoneid-fix-up-calculations-for-zoneid_pgshift.patch
My objections to those patches:
- They add zillions of ifdefs
- They make the VM's behaviour diverge between different platforms and
  between differen configs on the same platforms, and hence degrade
  maintainability and increase complexity.
- We kicked around some quite different ways of implementing the same
  things, but nothing came of it.  iirc, one was to remove the hard-coded
  zones altogether and rework all the MM to operate in terms of
	for (idx = 0; idx < NUMBER_OF_ZONES; idx++)
		...
- I haven't seen any hard numbers to justify the change.
So I want to drop them all.
