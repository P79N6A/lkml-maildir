The card is a DLink DFE 530TX:

eth0: VIA VT3043 Rhine at 0xe000, 00:50:ba:a5:5f:e6, IRQ 5.
eth0: MII PHY found at address 8, status 0x782d advertising 05e1 Link 40a1.
  PCI latency timer (CFLT) is unreasonably low at 32.  Setting to 64 clocks.
I see there is a newer version (1.08) although the 2.2.16 source
RPM includes the version above.  Is the newer one worth trying?
I had no difficulties copying 6-7GB of data ON to the machine
via NFS but "playing" the data from another machine with xmms 
seemingly caused me problems both times.  I've never seen this 
behavior before or anything like it on this machine (which has
always been very docile and stable).
