I'm forced to agree with most of what you say.

Yes.  This may delay the rmmod system call (make it wait until some other 
user process has closed the attribute file), but who cares about that?

Even that's not enough to be safe.  Modifying the reference count doesn't 
help because this isn't a problem of the object being deleted, it's a 
problem of a struct device_attributes being deleted -- and they don't have 
reference counts since they aren't objects.

Again I agree.  That was never my intention.  The change I originally
suggested would simply make device_remove_file() atomic with respect
to readers and writers of the attribute file:  It wouldn't return until
all current readers or writers had left the show()/store() routine, and
after it returned nobody would call show()/store().  I still don't see any 
reason not to implement something like this.

Most unsafe, perhaps.  But least qualified?  Who can possibly be more 
qualified to display the state or affect the functioning of a device than 
its driver?!
However, you may very well approve of my previous suggestion (crossed in 
the email) for a driver-specific subdirectory of the device directory.  I 
think it's more awkward, but it fits in your framework better.
