Hi,
Regarding:
Top level README in kernel 2.6.0 stable source
(downloaded from kernel.org on 10-18-2003)
In the last of the following five lines, 'install_modules' seem to me to be 
incorrect:
   To configure and build the kernel use:
   cd /usr/src/linux-2.6.N
   make O=/home/name/build/kernel menuconfig
   make O=/home/name/build/kernel
   sudo make O=/home/name/build/kernel install_modules install
____________________________________^
Am I correct that
                                install_modules
should be
                                module_install
?
I tried both and the latter seems to work but the former not.
Furthermore, I find the latter in two other parts of the README:
   make a backup of your modules directory before you
   do a "make modules_install".
____________________^
and:
 - If you configured any of the parts of the kernel as `modules', you
   will have to do "make modules" followed by "make modules_install".
______________________________________________^
Others like me will stumble on this. Who could update the README to correct 
this?
No person is mentioned as author or maintainer of the README.
Who should I send this feedback to?
Thanks,
Roger :-)
