[PATCH] device_shutdown can loop if the driver frees itself
This patch changes device_shutdown() to use the newly introduced safe
reverse list traversal.  We experienced loops on system reboot if we had
removed and re-inserted our device from the device list.
We noticed this problem on PPC405. Our PCI IDE device comes and goes a lot.
Our hypothesis was that there was a loop caused by the driver->shutdown
freeing memory.  It is possible that we do something wrong as well, but
being unable to reboot is kind of nasty.
