Anyway, we're working in discrete time, not linear time. Lag is
unavoidable. At best it can be bounded and compensated for. First time
I thought about this algorithm, I was looking at a line drawn using the
Bresenham algorithm. This algorithm is all about error compensation for
a perfect expectation. Too high, too far, too high, too far... I thought
that the line could represent a task progress as a function of time, and
the pixels the periods the task spends on the CPU. On short intervals,
you lose. On large ones, you're very close to the ideal case.

It's not a problem that a task receives much more CPU than it should,
provided that :
  a) it may do so for a short and bound time, typically less than the
     maximum acceptable latency for other tasks
  b) the excess of CPU it received is accounted for so that it is
     deduced from next passes.

I've been for O(1) algorithms for a long time, but seeing how dumb the
things you can do in O(1) are compared to O(logN), I definitely switched
my mind. Also, in O(logN), you often have a lot of common operations
still O(1). Eg: you insert in O(logN) in a time-ordered tree, but you
read from it in O(1). But you still have the ability to change its
content in O(logN) if you need.
Last but not least, spending one hundred cycles a few thousand times
a second is nothing compared to electing the wrong task for a full
time-slice.
