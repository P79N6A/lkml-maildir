 The I/O APIC need not be hooked to PCI ;-) -- I'm not sure about the
i82093AA, but that's definitely true for the i82489DX.  The call to
io_apic_sync() is needed for masking to make sure interrupts won't be
dispatched after returning from the call -- this is not needed for
unmasking as a delay here is harmless.
 Though, now that we don't mask APIC interrupts during their service
anymore the synchronization may be superfluous indeed -- other cases have
to take late interrupts into account anyway.
