First of all I think that I would merge pm and unbind mutex into one -
you also need to synchronize resume and suspend with bind and unbind
so you pretty much need to always acquire both of them.
Second (and I admit I have not followed USB autoresume discussions, my
usb-devle backlog is over 5000 messages ;( ) is I am not sure why
woudl a read block autoresume. I can see write doing that but passive
reads should not affect device state.
