Since this is IOMMU is built into the kernel and it is
good idea to report that the device is not present. The 
above is printed only once and is consistent with other
IOMMU implementation. Atleast it is useful when people 
report bugs we can makeout whether IOMMU is being detected
or not.
Here is what I see on my box.
[..]
"PCI-GART: No AMD northbridge found."
[..]
Calgary: detecting Calgary via BIOS EBDA area
Calgary: Unable to locate Rio Grande table in EBDA - bailing!
[..]
As you can see I don;t have either GART or Calgary on my box.
