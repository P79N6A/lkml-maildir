Hi Peter,

They are planning to release a patch against 2.6.10.  But their patch wont
stand alone against 2.6.10 and so it might be difficult for you to integrate
their code into a scheduler for plugsched.
Also, the CKRM scheduler only modifies Ingo's O(1) scheduler.  It certainly
would be interesting to have CKRM variants of the other schedulers.  This
points to a whole new level of 'plugsched' in that general O(1) schedulers
need to support fair share plugins.
