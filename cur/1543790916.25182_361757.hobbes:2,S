if it's kept in a file or cookie then it can survive a reboot and other 
distractions (remember that this process can take days if the problem 
doesn't show up at boot). a cookie can hold a couple K worth of data, a 
file has no size limit.
it would also be a good idea if the web page could give an estimate 
estimate of how many additional tests may end up being required.
