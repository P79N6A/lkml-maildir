Thanks!

CONFIG_IDE_GENERIC is enabled

CONFIG_IDE_GENERIC again
It was always like that but the printk has been added recently
so people start to noticing it...
Alan has a patch in -ac to not probe for legacy ports if system
has PCI but it needs testing and is limited to x86 currently.
Also it not a full solution as legacy ports logic needs to be
moved to ide_generic anyway...
