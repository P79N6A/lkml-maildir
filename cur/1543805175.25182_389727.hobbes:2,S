Well, I think we got the interface pretty much right -- and it is
really pretty simple. It survived pretty nasty stress testing at one
point.
Of course, bad things happen. Having it merged but disabled in
Makefile would certainly be preferred than not merged at
all. Plus... stable kernel or not, it is new feature, and userland
suspending programs are quite closely tied to the kernel. I think it
is reasonable to expect users to have matching version of kernel and
userland-swsusp tools, at least before dust settles.
