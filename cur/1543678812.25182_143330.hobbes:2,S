There are some boxes that don't work with the new ACPI code, but need
minimal acpi parsing for hyperthreaded CPUs etc.
To get these still to work the compatibility option is offered.
Basically it's another safety net. Of course it would be better
to make new ACPI work everywhere, but it's quite difficult.
For 2.4 it's better to have the fallback.
