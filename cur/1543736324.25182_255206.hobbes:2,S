Is this really a good idea?  I suspect it would be abused.  For example,
people would mlock mozilla or openoffice to keep it from being paged out
overnight when updatedb runs, where the real solution is to fix the
problem with the VM that causes updatedb to force other apps to swap
out. 
Making it harder to use mlock ensures that only apps that REALLY need it
will use it, time-critical stuff like ntpd and jackd.
