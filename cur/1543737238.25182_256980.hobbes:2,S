I know that.  However, when the empty statements were added to
ioctl32.h, those had to be taken out of the megaraid driver.  That's
this patch in the scsi-misc-2.6 tree:
 [PATCH] megaraid warning fix
  The ioctl32 conversion registration stubs are in ioctl32.h now.

The current preferred way is to use the empty definitions in
linux/ioctl32.h which means there's no necessity for adding the #ifdef
CONFIG_COMPAT.  The correct thing is to remove the #ifdef CONFIG_COMPAT
from around the register_ioctl32... part.
