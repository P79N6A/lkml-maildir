When you google for such messages, you can find a lot of people asking, 
but nobody seems to have an answer. That's why I ask this list, where 
the Godfathers Of Linux reside, and maybe someone hears my prayer and 
could explain us sheep what you should do in such a case. Increase the 
HZ from 250 to 1000, or decrease to 100? Or maybe setting the 
preemption model from server to voluntary or preemptible? Or is that 
whining to be ignored, and if yes, what is this message for at all?
Please give us wisdom, and we will spread your word. Amen.
Answers please per PM, I'm not on this list.
mfg zmi *or could you ask in a nicer way?*
