my issues raised in response to this idea are unanswered.

First of all we will be doing unnecessary checks to see if there is
an imbalance.. Current code triggers the checks and movement only when
it is necessary.. And second, finding the correct destination cpu in the 
presence of SMT and MC is really complicated.. Look at different examples
in the OLS paper.. Domain topology provides all this info with no added
complexity...

I don't see a merit and so I am not looking into this.
