    ... It does,
    however, screw over your partition tables. I have two PCs right here that
    are currently not functional because of this. Does anyone know if Norton
    DiskDoctor might be able to fix the partition tables and at least recover
    some data?

What is that nonsense? Norton DiskDoctor?
Of course you use Linux DiskDoctor, and write it if it doesnt exist.
I think it exists already, but since I do not have a reference
and it is trivial to do, I just typed a tiny program that does a 100%
job of finding partitions on 4 of my disks. It only recognizes ext2
and old-fashioned swap space, and outputs (within a few seconds)
# ./rescue /dev/sda
        0: partition or fat sector
ext2 partition: sectors 62 - 24799
ext2 partition: sectors 24800 - 4129199
  4129200: partition or fat sector
old swap space: sectors 4129262 - 4390765
  4402000: partition or fat sector
ext2 partition: sectors 4402062 - 8506399
  8506400: partition or fat sector
ext2 partition: sectors 8506462 - 12523999
 12524000: partition or fat sector
where sfdisk says
# sfdisk -l -uS /dev/sda
Disk /dev/sda: 1020 cylinders, 200 heads, 62 sectors/track
Units = sectors of 512 bytes, counting from 0
   Device Boot    Start       End  #sectors  Id  System
/dev/sda1   *        62     24799     24738  83  Linux
/dev/sda2         24800   4129199   4104400  83  Linux
/dev/sda3       4129200  12647999   8518800   5  Extended
/dev/sda4             0         -         0   0  Empty
/dev/sda5       4129262   4401999    272738  82  Linux swap
/dev/sda6       4402062   8506399   4104338  83  Linux
/dev/sda7       8506462  12523999   4017538  83  Linux
/dev/sda8      12524062  12647999    123938  ff  BBT
Since it does not recognize anything other than ext2
and looks at every sector, it will be very slow on large disks
with other types of filesystem.
No doubt someone else can add stuff for other filesystems
(or tell me where to find the already existing utility).
