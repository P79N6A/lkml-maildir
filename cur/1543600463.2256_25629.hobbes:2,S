I was able to run it on my laptop (compay presario) with 2.4.10-pre4 plus
kernel preemption patch plus
acpi development patches (battery status still unavailable though sigh).
tulip-0.92wax (Support for CONEXTANT onboard Ethernet)
wlan-ng 0.1.8-pre13 + airsnort patches (for SMC WiFi Card)
Seems to work very well.... Wish all the above stuff would be making it
into the kernel soon.. I keep having to patch up the kernels.
Amazing support for hardware considering I saw no support for the ACPI
stuff and the onboard ethernet when I bought the laptop....
