My main aim is to run a particular application in a known and fixed
physical memory location. When kernel loads this binary, is there a
way to force it to load at that fixed memory location. For example I
always wanna run a program "hello_world.bin" from physical address
location 0x007F_0000 to 0x007F_FFFF. I want my data, stack etc to be
in this location only.
The word "secure" is our internal terminology which seems to be bit confusing.
Thanks
