Well, in your previous series of patches there are examples to the contrary,
like the changes to kthread_create() or workqueues.  They would require an ack
from the maintainers of that code, at least.
Also, you probably need some changes in the arch code.  If that is so, the
maintainers of relevant architectures should be asked.
That already is "many".

Accepted. :-)

In not many ways, really.  Of course you can do a DoS with them, but need
to be root to do this anyway.

That's fine. :-)
Obviously both solutions are used, so they both seem to be needed.
