The tainting flag is in each module.  Instead of trying them all
to see what taints the kernel, run "find"
over /etc/modules/<kernelversion>
to find all modules installed, and use some program
that print out the taintedness for each file.  Simple, and
works even for modules that never gets loaded during normal use.
I don't know if such a program exists, but it should be trivial
to make, just paste the kernel "tainting" code into a
ordinary program.
