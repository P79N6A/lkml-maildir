Yes, it's a bit annoying but not necessarily that bad. In fact, we don't
have to make it non-preemptible, we did it because it was easier that way
I strongly suspect. In fact, the batch could actually be attached to the
mm rather than the CPU for that matter, no ? Or is there a fudamental
reason I'm not seeing why it -has- to be per-cpu ?

But that means two different APIs for almost the same thing. I'm trying
to clean up the mess, not add more :-) Beside, that "other" API would
have overall much of the same issues no ? Or do you want to have that
"other" API not actually provide a percpu "mmu_gather" type structure at
all in asm-generic (but basically just boil down to an empty inline for
creating the "other" batch and flush_tlb_mm() for finishing it with an
empty inline for "adding" a PTE to the list of invalidation targets ?)
