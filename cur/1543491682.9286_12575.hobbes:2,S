Something odd happened when I tried to make menuconfig on a 2.2.5 kernel
-- I got a gripe about ncurses maybe not being installed right and cd
scripts/lcdialog to make clean all...
But that failed because HOSTCC wasn't properly defined in the makefile.
[DLOCALE command not found].
I don't know all the assumptions the kernel make is supposed to enforce,
but if the makefile caretaker can't figure out how to sort this one out
properly, email me with the invocation conditions it's supposed to work
under and I'll give you a patch.
