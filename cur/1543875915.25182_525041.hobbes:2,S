Hi all,
  I've been hacking on the Linux kernel all semester for my OS:
Internals class. We are given full autonomy in picking our final
programming project and I would love for mine to be /useful/ for the
Linux kernel and not just a theoretical exorcise. If anybody has any
bug fixes or features maybe they never got around to, and would be
suitable for this situation, I would love to hear about them.
Thanks in advance,
 Russ Meyerriecks
