Actually, I communicated with kernel directly in my app and don't use tc at all.
That tc command is used just for expressing my problem conveniently.
My problem is that I need to match udp/tcp packets with different s/d
port(f.e., all udp packets which source port is greater than 53 and
less than 5069) on ingress, but u32 classifier in kernel(not the tc
app) doesn't support matching value in a range.
So I think I may need to modify the kernel to add range support for
u32 classifier. But I am worrying its performance will be down.
Does anyone have a more clever solution?
