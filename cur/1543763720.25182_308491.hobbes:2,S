suspend2disk runs without any problem, even with X running.
it is only suspend2ram which stopped working after 2.6.11-mm4 (at least
in 2.6.12-rc1-mm3,4).
Concerning tests with minimal kernel config: I guess since it *was*
working there should not be a change necessary -- but well, from
2.6.11-mm2 to 2.6.11-mm4 I had to stop hotplug/usb to get ot working, so
maybe now I have to stop all the other things. Grrrr. This is not what I
want!
Isn't there a different way?
Best wishes
Norbert

DORRIDGE (n.)
Technical term for one of the lame excuses written in very small print
on the side of packets of food or washing powder to explain why
there's hardly anything inside. Examples include 'Contents may have
settled in transit' and 'To keep each biscuit fresh they have been
individually wrapped in silver paper and cellophane and separated with
corrugated lining, a cardboard flap, and heavy industrial tyres'.
