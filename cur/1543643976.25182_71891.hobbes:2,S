Except that like everything else related to the local APIC, you're at
the mercy of the competence (or lack thereof) of the BIOS implementors.
- There are plenty of laptops whose CPUs have local APICs but whose
  BIOSen go berserk if you enable it. There are also plenty of laptops
  that don't have one, since Intel removed it from many Mobile P6 CPUs.
- There are even some desktop boards with BIOS problems, including Intel's
  AL440LX on which Linux must stay away from the local APIC timer.
To assume the local APIC works on 686-class UP boxes is not realistic, alas.
