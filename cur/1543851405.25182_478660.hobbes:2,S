	So the user doesn't really specify percentage but values that feed into
ratios used by the underlying controller? If so then it's not terribly
different from the "shares" of single level of Resource Groups. 
	Resource groups goes one step further and defines a denominator for
child groups to use. This allows the shares to be connected vertically
so that changes don't need to propagate beyond the parent and child
groups.

Shouldn't they all have the same denominator (60), or am I
misunderstanding something?
If so then it should be:
X = 10/60      16.666...%
Y = 20/60      33.333...%
Z = 30/60      50.0%
