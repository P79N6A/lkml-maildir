Ok, I adapted that stuff to 2.3.10, and my SIGTERM idea. I choosed SIGTERM
finally, because that doesn't resemble a keyboard event (SIGQUIT), so
processes know that they got to finish, and not just display a silly
message ("my keybindings say that ^\ really means something different").
I tested this with a self-written memory hog, and it got SIGTERMed. Well,
I'm testing it again while I'm writing this mail with the term signal
more or less ignored (catches forced signal and continues to allocate
memory). Got killed.
It looks good to me, now try and give your comments (the next two
processes in the high score were Emacs and Enlightenment, and that's
really a good memory bloat index ;-).
