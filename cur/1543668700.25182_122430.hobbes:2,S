I use rounded cables in my case for a few reasons:
- The distance between my promise and my drives is small yet the promise
cables are long, the rounded cables I have are 12" long and fit very neatly
- The promise cables had two IDE connectors but I only wanted to put one
drive per channel; the rounded cables are single cables
- Air flow; because of my small casing the flat promise cables were
contricting the airflow quite a bit, the rounded less
- flexibility; I found the flat cables hard to bend in to place whereas the
round cables you could twist easily
I've added a link which should make it clear that rounded cables in my case
are a benefit to me. What I was worried about was that they could be
inferior quality and thus be a factor in my raid performance.
