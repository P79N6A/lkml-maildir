Looking at it via gitweb, I think the commit mentioned above is actually the
same as what I submitted. The diff context lines are different because there
was a similar patch in between the 2.6.22 release and my patch, which
apparently fixed the same problem on a different type of machine. It looks
like these 2 workarounds will function independently of each other.
The first 8042-detection fix was:
db0dbae9d9680bce69fe1ce775709e60c8ee9c29
And mine is:
f5d834fc34e61f1a40435981062000e5d2b2baa8
