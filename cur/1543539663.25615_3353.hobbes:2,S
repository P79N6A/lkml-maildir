Yikes! This way lies madness (at least for SCSI). Removing the
equivalent of the sg interfaces would reduce Linux to a platform much
like Windows where every single new SCSI device probably needs to
provide its own kernel modifications/modules/driver to allow
device-specific apps to talk to it.
Right now, you can write (for example) an Iomega Jaz utility without
any kernel futzing at all. Contrast this with Windows where it seems
necessary to always install a new driver.
Don't go there.
