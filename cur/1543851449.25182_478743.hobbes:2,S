Yes. Lets start with it - no separate groupings for a while.
BTW I think that hierarchy is a good (and easier to make than)
replacement for separate grouping. Say if I want two groups to
have separate CPU shares and common kmemsize this is the same as
if I want one group for kmemsize with two kids - one for X% of
CPU share and the other for Y%. And this (hierarchy) provides
more flexibility than "plain" although separate grouping.
Moreover configfs can provide a clean interface for it. E.g.
 $ mkdir /configfs/beancounters/0
 $ mkdir /configfs/beancounters/0/1
 $ mkdir /confgifs/beancounters/0/2
and each task_struct will have a single pointer - current
container - but not 10 - for each controller.
What do you think?

That's it... One more thing against separate grouping.

I agree with Paul Menage that having
/configfs/beancounters/<id>/tasks and /.../threads is perfect.
