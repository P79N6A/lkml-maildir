No, suppressing warnings like that would be bad.  Instead, you write
functions like this:
	#ifdef CONFIG_FOO
	extern int register_foo(foo_fn myfunction);
	#else
	static inline int register_foo(foo_fn myfunction)
	{
		return 0;
	}
	#endif /* CONFIG_FOO */
That way, there's no unused warning, but gcc knows enough to discard
the function.
Hope that clarifies!
Rusty.
