Now all you have to do is tell this to the gcc developers ;)

For some things, I'd expect it will be an optimisation, which is why
they're even doing it. Even on x86 perhaps, where they do tricks with
sbb/adc. If it avoids an unpredictable branch, it could help. Actually
a silly microbenchmark shows it's worth 10% to do a cmov vs an
unpredictable conditional jump, but another 2.5% to do the adc and
unconditional store (which is the problematic bit).
And for unshared things like local variables where their address
hasn't escaped, it's fine.
Still, I guess that for most non-stack variables, you would actually
_want_ to do a cmov rather than the adc, even in a single threaded
program. Because you don't want to touch the cacheline if possible,
let alone dirty it.
