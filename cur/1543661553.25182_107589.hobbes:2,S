Just a quick clarification before this thing explodes in another "ten
thousan messages" thread.

That's wonderful (no kidding).

It would be quite interesting for me, sincerely.  Feel free to send me
the patch if you can.

As far as I'm concerned, I just wrote:
-   that  Montavista claims  they implemented    XIP as  part of their
"Consumer Electronics Edition" package;
- that source  code is included in Montavista  preview kit, but that I
couldn't find any XIP reference in it;
- that  probably XIP is a part  of the CEE   edition but *not*  of the
preview kit, hence the  lack of source code  for that specific part in
the ISO I downloaded; incidentally, that also means that right now I'm
not  entitled  to have source   code for Montavista XIP implementation
(and I stated that clearly);
I  personally  don't  have anything  against   Montavista, and I think
they're doing a  good work (I  know  that you have to  balance between
distributing source code and having your old-minded customers run away
in fear).  I  still think that having  an encrypted ISO image is  pure
brain damage, because  it doesn't buy  Montavista anything as far as I
can tell and it just slows down casual observers  - which, by the way,
are the kind of people Montavista is supposed to attract. :)
Let's straighten out this  issue.  Maybe a  public development tree of
Montavista kernels, with  a  big red  flag saying  "don't use this  on
production systems" would be enough.
Best regards,
