How about: "If IRIX isn't clearing these bits then they're leaving their
customers wide open to all sorts of security issues."
Unless you make the chmod/chgrp atomic with the write, then there will
always be a way for a client to inject data while the setuid/setgid bits
are set: basically, it allows said client to rewrite a setuid/setgid
executable.
We're not fixing this in the client because it isn't fixable on the
client.
