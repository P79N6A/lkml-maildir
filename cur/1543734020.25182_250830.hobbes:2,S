Hi !
The recent sungem NAPI change introduced a bug: dev_kfree_skb() is called
within the spinlock, thus triggers all sort of WARN_ON's later on down the
stack.
This patch changes it to dev_kfree_skb_any(), I hope that is fine
as we aren't really in interrupt, are we ? (I don't know in what
context NAPI polling occurs, is it a timer IRQ ?)
Ben.
