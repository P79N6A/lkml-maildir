I think you can already do this with the existing LSM interface, you can
always get the dentry for a given inode, right?  I think there might be
a problem in determining the "real" path structure of the dentry all the
time due to mount locations, but that will be fixed up by the time 2.6
is out.

No!  One of the main goals of the LSM design was to not override the
current Linux permission behavior.  It can only deny access to things,
not be a permissive system of allowing access to things that the current
system denies.  See the many threads on the LSM mailing list for the
reasons behind this.
