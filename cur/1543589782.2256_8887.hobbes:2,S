Known problem... For some reason, even current vger CVS has it.
You might want to try Eirik's patch, but I have not idea if
it is correct.

IMHO, sparc needs a port maintainer. Obviously, DaveM has barely
enough time to deal with sparc64. Unfortunately it is not a position
for weak (like myself). At various times I, Uzi, and Anton tried
that crown for size, but it is way too big and heavy.
