Could you try "echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/lower_zone_protection" ?
I have a feeling that the lower zone protection logic could
be badly messing up systems in the 24-48 MB range, as well
as systems in the 1.5-3 GB range.
This would be because the allocation threshold for the
lower zone would be 30% higher than the high threshold
of the pageout code, meaning that the memory in the lower
zone would be just sitting there, without old pages being
recycled by the pageout code.
In effect, your 32 MB test would have old memory in the
lower 16 MB, without the pageout code reusing that memory
for something more useful, reducing the amount of memory
the system really uses well to something way lower.
