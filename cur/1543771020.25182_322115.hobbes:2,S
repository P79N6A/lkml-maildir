Agreed.  I only brought up the stupid names just to show that there's
not a black and white aspect to what RT is.  It's mainly a black art
since there's no way to know how many bugs a program has, and how do you
truly calculate the MTBF, other than running it on the hardware itself?

True, but do they really know how good PREEMPT_RT is, compared to those
that develop it and the kernel?  But I'm fighting to get PREEMPT_RT into
the kernel, since I really think it would be used by quite a lot in the
industry.  Just not the normal Desktop user.
