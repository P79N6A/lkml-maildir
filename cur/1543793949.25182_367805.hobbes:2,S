It's only been in my tree for a week.  It came to me after I had done
the big merge cycle with Linus after 2.6.14 came out.  For major changes
to a driver like this one, I want to get some good testing in the -mm
tree, and then it will go into mainline.
So, it will be a few more weeks, I'll send it to Linus after 2.6.15 is
out.
thanks,
