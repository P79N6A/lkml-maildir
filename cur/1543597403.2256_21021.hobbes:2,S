One other thing is that I have no proof that they are reaching that server
farm from a conventional web browser or conventional network. They might be
using some kind of cellular modem attached to a phone or some other wireless
access that might be making several hops to get the data to them. I simply
have no idea. All I know is increasing the default hop count makes it work
and that is good enough for me. If that person can access a Win2k web server
but not my Linux server, there might be a business case against using Linux.
Of course I can always manually bump the default TTL but not every admin of
a website will know to do that. I am just trying to help Linux gain the
maximum possible acceptance by working with the maximum possible number of
clients with the least amount of fuss.
