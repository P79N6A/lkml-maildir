Hi
	I'm trying to move from an pure usb hid + acpi + io-apic UP 2.4 system
to a 2.5 one. Hardware is via kt400 based. The problem is :
      * 2.5 io-apic kills usb input 
device not accepting address", see
http://linux-usb.sourceforge.net/FAQ.html#ts6
      * without io-apic build-in  rt8139too do not work with acpi :

      * without acpi and io-apic network and usb works, but obviously
        not acpi:(
So right now on 2.5 i have to choose between broken input, broken
network or broken acpi:((.
Here are /proc/interrupts contents for various configurations on this
system, I don't find them all that enlightening but maybe someone here
can interpret them.
