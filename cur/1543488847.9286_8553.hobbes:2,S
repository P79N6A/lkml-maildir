Here's the kicker: LOAD (Linux on a floppy) runs just fine for whatever I do,
and when I boot to a normal installation option on the Debian instalation floppy
I can mount filesystems and such just fine and use them as well, it only seems
to do this when it's booting from a HD.  I've also noted that it does behave a
little better at it's rated speed, but sometimes it still goes boink (lots less
often).  It always happens right around the time it hits up the EIDE disks for
fsck's.  I've also noticed that 2.2.x will ALWAYS come up with a general
protection fault when it starts to read the disks.  I'm beginning to think it's
not a CPU thing, but perhaps a bug I might have stumbled upon in the IDE code. 
And 2.2.x ALWAYS has the protection fault, no matter WHAT speed the CPU runs at.
