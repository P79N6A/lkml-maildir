Exactly. If I remount the device it looks like everything is okay, but
if I put it into my notebook instead the CF appears still empty. If I do
the module unloading before I remove the CF from the reader it works. I
don't think that it is the card reader, since it works perfectly with
Windows XP or 2000.
Just for reference I use a ML4-USB card reader/writer from Datafab. It
is a device with 4 slots (each appearing as an own device) for
CF,SM,SD,MS
Kind regards
