Thanks for your info. I am working hard with that.
By the way, i have some problems with the SPI hardware arch. Please correct me.
What in my mind is that SPI clk is only triggered by master and master
read/write at the same time. But how could master know the read data
is valid? is it determine by the protocol driver? In a case, when
master place a tx-only msg to the controller driver, and slave request
to send in the middle of the transaction. The data from slave will
push into the rx buffer of the tx-only msg and finally ignore by the
protocol driver...... I really get confused to this "full" duplex
transmittion. Could anyone tell me the real situation?
Also, in your pxa_spi driver, you always read before write in the
interrupt handler. If rx and tx is pointing to the same buffer,
reading data will always overwrite the tx data. why not write before
read?
I am new to SPI , and with this loose bus structure i could not find a
good reference for me to study deeper. Do you have any reference
source?
Thanks for concern and patience
