Yes there is. "root" == administrator. Just because you have
capabilities doesn't mean you have to discard root. Capabilities are a
way of refining privileges, so you get something between average luser
and root. This in no way implies that average luser or root or
privileges or accounts are discarded.

Won't happen. UID=0 is root, and means something special. A
capabilities-enabled system doesn't change that.

There is no practical reason why storing capability information in an
ELF header won't work.

You actually *want* capabilities to be copied around with tar, cp and
friends. I don't want to use special tools to backup or copy my
system.

tar, cp, cpio, gzip, bzip2, NFS, CODA, rdist and many more, I'm
sure. I've got a backup programme written in C which would lose
capability information unless I went in an added a Linux-specific hack
to it. I'm sure there are dozens or hundreds of similar "personal"
programmes out there that will break.
