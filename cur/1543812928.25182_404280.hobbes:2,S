I had all this code converted to seq_file, but it depends on converting
input handlers to class interfaces and it is not possible nowadays
because with latest Greg's changes to class code we would try to
register class devices while registering class devices/interfaces
(psmouse creates input_dev which binds to mousedev interface which in
turn tries to create mouseX which is also belongs to input class) and
deadlocking. Greg promised current implementation is only a temporary
solution.
I suppose I could separate those changes...
BTW, what is ETA for 2.6.16 - I could not affort enought time getting
psmouse resync logic working in all cases so I'd like to have it disabled
for 2.6.16 final.
