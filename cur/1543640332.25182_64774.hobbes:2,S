	From visiting the osdl.org booth a LinuxWorld, I understand
that they have a farm of 150 deliberately differently configured
computers on which you are supposed to be able to run your own
kernel tests on your own kernels.
	They have a procedure for adding new tests described at
http://www.osdl.org/stp/HOWTO.Port_Tests.html.
	I think it would be informative to run 2.4 ported code and
Martin's stack against IDE tests on this system.  With this, you could
not only spot problems, but see problems happening in a certain pattern
which could sometimes simplify finding a bug.
