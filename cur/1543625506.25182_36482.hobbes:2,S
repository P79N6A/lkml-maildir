Pete,
There has long been a preference in the scsi subsystem
for using its own memory management ( scsi_malloc() )
or the most conservative mm calls. GFP_ATOMIC may well
be overkill in scsi_build_commandblocks(). However it
might be wise to check that the calling context is indeed
user_space since this can be called from all subsystems 
that have a scsi pseudo device driver (e.g. ide-scsi, 
usb-storage, 1394/sbp2, ...).

Another badly named function since it is unregistering
in upper level driver (e.g. sd). That "if" is to check
if there are open file descriptors (or some other
reason **) on the driver in question. That seems to be
a sensible check. Whether it can every happen in that
context, I'm not sure.
** The sg driver purposely holds its USE_COUNT > 0 even
when all its file descriptors are closed iff there are
outstanding commands for which the response has not
yet arrived. [If this is not done, then a control-C on
something like cdrecord followed by "rmmod sg" may
cause an oops, especially during "fixating" mode.]
