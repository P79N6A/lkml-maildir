The only really sane way to implement "CONFIG_SMALL_NO_INLINES" that I
can think of is to have headers do
#include <linux/inline.h>
inline_me int function(int x) { return x++; }
Then inline.h contain:
#include <linux/config.h>
#ifdef CONFIG_SMALL_NO_INLINES
#define inline_me
#else
#define inline_me static inline
#endif
And if do a final compile of a file "inlines.c" like so if
CONFIG_SMALL_NO_INLINES is set:
#include <linux/config.h>
#undef CONFIG_SMALL_NO_INLINES
/* Instantiate one of each inline for real: auto-generated list */
#include <linux/header1.h>
#include <linux/header2.h>
#include <linux/header3.h>
#include <linux/header4.h>
Expect an implementation in... um... well, someone else perhaps?
Rusty.
