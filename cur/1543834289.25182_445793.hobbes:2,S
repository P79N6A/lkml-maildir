Urgs, so any user may remove mappings from another process and
let it crash?
Reading revoke man pages, it seems the system call was meant for
tty devices.  While I can see the generic case  to be useful for
forced unmount, it seems pretty dangerous to allow any user to
revoke file access and tear down mappings.
Who needs the generic case anyway?  IMO that's too much rope.
The effect on affected processes is nearly unpredictable.
IMHO, fuser is "good enough(tm)".
Btw, grep revoke POSIX.txt -> nil.
Ciao, ET.
