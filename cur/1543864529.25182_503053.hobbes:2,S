Oh, I had forgotten that.  Thank you for pointing out.  The purpose of
this sysctl is to prevent a bad process from hiding its memory.
But as you say, this sysctl isn't enough for the purpose.

I have never heard of the story that ulimit -c 0 bothered an
administrator who wanted to force a coredump.  So even without this
sysctl, the administrator wouldn't bother about security concerns.
I'll drop it from the next version.
