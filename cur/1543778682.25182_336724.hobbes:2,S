Cool.

Currently device_suspend(PMSG_FREEZE) in the reboot path breaks
the e1000 and the ide driver.  Which is common enough hardware it
effectively breaks reboots in 2.6.13 despite the fact that nearly
everything thing else works.
To make device_suspend(PMSG_FREEZE) solid in the reboot path I think
it would take pushing and stabilizing all of PMSG_FREEZE != PMSG_SUSPEND.
It will certainly take a bunch of digging to make certain reboots keep
working.  Since the number of drivers that implement either a reboot
notifier or a shutdown method is small the it is conceivable we could
track down all of the serious issues before 2.6.13.  However I'm
not ready to take point on the bug hunt.
So unless you are really ambitious I'd like to take
device_suspend(PMSG_FREEZE) out of the reboot path for
2.6.13, put in -mm where people can bang on it for a bit
and see that it is coming and delay the merge with the stable
branch until the bugs with common hardware have been sorted out.
