ARGH!  STOP IT!  I realize it's 'leet to be continually worrying about
possible microoptimizations, but I challenge you to *measure* the
slowdown between:

and

*Especially* in this context.  Sure, a new "max_cpu_number" or
"cpu_for_each(i)" macro would fix this, but at the expense of using up
additional stack in the reader's brain.
Let's not perpetuate the myth that everything in the kernel needs to
be tuned to the last cycle at all costs, hm?
Yes, you stepped on a sore point 8)
Rusty.
PS.  Of course, you know the correct answer, anyway.
