Please define : marker intrusiveness. I think that this is not a sole concept.
First, I think we have to look at intrusiveness under three different angles :
- Visual intrusiveness (hurts visually in the code)
- Compiled-in, but inactive intrusiveness
  - Modifies compiler optimisations when the marker is compiled in but no
    tracing is active.
  - Wastes a few cycles because it adds NOPs, jump, etc in a critical path
    when tracing is not active.
- Active tracing intrusiveness
  - Wastes too many cycles in a critical path when tracing is active.
The problem is that a static marker will speed up the active tracing while a
dynamic probe will speed up the case where tracing is inactive. The problem is
that the dynamic probe cost can get so big that it modifies the traced system
often more than acceptable. Under this angle, I would be tempted to say that the
most intrusive instrumentation should be helped by marker, which means accepting
a very small performance impact (NOPs on modern CPUs are quite fast) when
tracing is not active in order to enable fast tracing of some very high event
rate kernel code paths.

By "hardest", do you mean : where the data that is to be extracted is not easily
available due to compiler optimisations ?

We completely agree on this last paragraph.

But I also think that a marker mechanism should not only mark the code location
where the instrumentation is to be made, but also the information the probe is
interested into (provide compile-time data type verification and address at
runtime). Doing otherwise would limit what could be provided to static markup
users.
