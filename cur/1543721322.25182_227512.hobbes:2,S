There are many variables that will determine peak bandwidth for an I/O
adapter.  The size of the I/O request as well as the number of I/O requests
outstanding affect bandwidth.  The PCI commands used by the adapters to
transfer the memory (burst length, etc) will change the amount of overhead
for the different devices too.
Unless mistaken, Myrinet PCI-X adapters operate at 2.5Gb full duplex per
port, while the Mellanox 4x InfiniBand HCA operates at 10Gb full duplex per
port.  From the HW characteristics, you should be able to get 4x the
bandwidth out of the IB HCA (assuming linear scale-up and comparable HW
operation), so that might explain your bandwidth discrepancy between the
different HW.
Lastly, a PCI analyzer can be useful in seeing exactly what commands are
used and how large a burst the different HW adapters are capable of, but
that moves you out of pure SW benchmarking.

You don't need a single test.  What you need is to control what each test
does.  Same size I/O, same number of outstanding requests, etc.  If you have
that, you should be able to compare.

PCI writes to HBA attached memory may not use the same PCI commands as I/O
DMA, and thus might lead to totally different results.

Things like MPI benchmarks should do the trick, since only the underlying HW
provider changes.  I'm assuming you can get MPI on top of Myrinet.

Give MPI benchmarks a try.
Good luck,
