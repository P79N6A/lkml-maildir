I have a feeling that the pageout performance got broken again, even more. 
It was OK for a while and we need to backtrack and see where it went wrong.
The below might improve things, but I doubt it.
From: Nick Piggin <nickpiggin@yahoo.com.au>
If the zone has a very small number of inactive pages, local variable
`ratio' can be huge and we do way too much scanning.  So much so that Ingo
hit an NMI watchdog expiry, although that was because the zone would have a
had a single refcount-zero page in it, and that logic recently got fixed up
via get_page_testone().
Nick's patch simply puts a sane-looking upper bound on the number of pages
which we'll scan in this round.  It hasn't had a lot of thought or testing
yet.
