I like it (having just argued for it), except for the __s* and __u*.
The ABI definitions aren't for kernel programmers. They are for 
userspace programmers. So we should use standard types,
even if they are a bit ugly (and uint16_t isn't really much uglier
than __u16, and at least it doesn't carry connotations of
something that is meant to be internal, which is what the standard
double-underscore convention means). 
Please, let us agree that the ABI definition should use standard
types wherever possible.
