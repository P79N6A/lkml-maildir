Subject: Small es1371 documentation fix (joyport)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The documentation for the es1371 driver doesn't mention how to
activate/specify the joystick port's base address (I had to look in the
code).  This patch fixes it.  The same probably applies to the es1370 as
well as other cards, but lacking said cards, I couldn't say for sure. 
You may wish to re-word this, as it is not very concise, nor does it
read well (not that that's ever mattered in documentation before ;-). 
If you have any replies, please CC me directly (I'm no longer subscribed
to the list).
Thanks,
