Seems, it serializes mod_timer and timer handler to keep timer
in predictable state. Maybe, this is not necessary. A priori, it is required.
Note that in dev_watchdog_down() queue_lock is released before
taking xmit_lock. Probably, this is the thing which was supposed
to be done in dev_watchdog_up() too.
