Well the O= syntax is much nicer when using Git.   You symply checkout the
branch you're interested in and compile it; then switch to another,
compile it, etc...  Git makes checking out a brach lightning fast, it's
very slick.   Using the O= notation means you only have one branch checked
out at a time and there's no need to have source files linked to a bunch
of different directories.
Cheers,
Sean
