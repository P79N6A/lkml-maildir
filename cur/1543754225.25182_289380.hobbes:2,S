Module is just a piece of code, or programm if someone may think.
And there no problems when we type
$ ps
and see only "aterm", if someone wants to know what exactly means "aterm",
one can run ps axufw.
And even with the case of lsmod: one can see that scx200 will or will not
 depend on superio, and that will explain everything.
