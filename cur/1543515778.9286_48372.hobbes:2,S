Nov 11 09:24:28 snip460 kernel: probably an unrecoverable SCSI bus or device
hang.
Nov 11 09:24:29 snip460 kernel: (scsi1:0:6:0) Using wide (16 bit) transfers.
Nov 11 09:24:29 snip460 kernel: (scsi1:0:6:0) Synchronous at 20.0MHz, offset
8.
The machine is a SNI Primergy 460 still running under SuSE Linux 5.3
(2.0.35).
This happens from time to time when a Win-client copies a greater file onto
a
server HD via Samba. It often leads to a complete system hang and mostly
I have a corrupted inode on the HD in question afterwards.
Thanks for any help.
Bye,
Rainer
