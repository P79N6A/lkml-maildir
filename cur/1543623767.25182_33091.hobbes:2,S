I didn't include subversion because no one has volunteered help make 
gateway stuff from the subversion project. Let's concentrate one gateway 
setup first.

It is not my intention to force any kind of a 'lowest common denominator' 
setup. Going from a system with fewer capabilities to one with greater 
capabilities (i.e., currently arch->bk) is going to require some manual 
intervention from $MAINTAINER.
What I'd like to see is someone volunteer to help develop gateway scripts
(where did all those patchbot people go now?). Then I'd like to see 
someone volunteer to be a maintainer to run a gateway so that people that 
feel arch is a better solution can use it, and those that feel BK is a 
better solution can get on with life and not leave anyone out because they 
may have issues with the bk license, or even real technical issues with 
BK.
Obviously using arch is going to be harder, because it is nowwhere near 
mature as BK is. Some people are willing to make that tradeoff.
