I'm not saying sys_sync is broken. I _am_ saying that if you have
processes submitting I/O while you're trying to sync, syncing will take
longer and you may well still end up with dirty buffers at the end. On
top of this, you may think freezing has failed because processes don't
enter the refrigerator within your timelimit (assuming you have one).
The simple, logic solution is to stop threads that are submitting I/O
before you stop threads that are syncing I/O.
