	Old APIs get deprecated, and people are forced to the new API,
which is exactly the same as far as userspace is concerned. This
transition is exactly the same as what you propose, both kernel API
coexist for some time, except it happens in userspace instead of in
kernel, which is an implementation detail.
	So, my question is when can I remove the old ESSID API.

	The Wireless people (Jouni, Dan) decided to change the
*userspace* API. We could translate the new *userspace* API to the old
kernel API, but I don't see the point.

	That's exactly what it hinges on. What is your criteria for
removing the old ESSID API. My understanding was 6 months.
