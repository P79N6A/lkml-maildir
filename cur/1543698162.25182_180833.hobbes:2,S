Hi!
While looking at drivers/acpi/parser/psxface.c,I have noticed that the
acpi_psx_execute(0 function seems to held some structures referrenced
when an error occurs during its execution:
acpi_status
acpi_psx_execute (
        struct acpi_namespace_node      *method_node,
        union acpi_operand_object       **params,
        union acpi_operand_object       **return_obj_desc)
{
...
        if (params) {
                /*
                 * The caller "owns" the parameters, so give each one an
extra
                 * reference
                 */
                for (i = 0; params[i]; i++) {
                        acpi_ut_add_reference (params[i]);
                }
        }
        /*
         * 1) Perform the first pass parse of the method to enter any
         * named objects that it creates into the namespace
         */
        ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT ((ACPI_DB_PARSE,
                "**** Begin Method Parse **** Entry=%p obj=%p\n",
                method_node, obj_desc));
        /* Create and init a Root Node */
        op = acpi_ps_create_scope_op ();
        if (!op) {
                return_ACPI_STATUS (AE_NO_MEMORY);
        }
As you can see, acpi_psx_execute() will hold a lock for each element of
the params[] array if there's an error while invoking
acpi_ps_create_scope_op(), for example.
Is this intentional?
Thanks!
