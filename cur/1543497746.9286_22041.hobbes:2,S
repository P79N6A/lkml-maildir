Fundamentally. skbuffs are single physically linear blocks, BSD mbufs are
chains of small blocks. The BSD code nowdays makes heavy use of "mbuf
clusters" to effectively get linear buffers most of the time.
Having chains means you keep having to say 'is the rest of this structure
in this buffer' and 'copy this around a bit to make the structure in one
buffer'.
