I have three worries:
 - this is large, with no input from anybody else that I have seen.
 - I absolutely detest getting encoded patches. It makes it much harder
   for me to just quickly look them over for an immediate feel for what
   they look like.
 - Ingo just did the page cache / buffer cache dirty stuff, this is going
   to clash quite badly with his changes I suspect.
So would you mind just sending the patches in plaintext, one by one, to
avoid at least one of my worries (and as a reference to other people: this
is basicall yhow I always prefer patches). 
The other worries I'll see about later. The short descriptions sound fine,
although I still want to look at the vm_store part closer..
