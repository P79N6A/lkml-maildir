There is an old patch around from SGI that does exactly this. It is a
very lightweight binary value tracer that has per CPU buffers. It
traces using macros that you can easily add. It's called ktrace (not
to be confused with Ingo's ktrace). I've been porting it for some time
for my own tracing needs (adding tracing macros as needed but never submitting
them). If you're interested I can submit it for 2.5 (without any hooks, people
should just add them as needed and then remove them again)
