Hi,
I got this compile error with a randconfig ( 
http://194.231.229.228/MM/randconfig-auto-82.broken.netpoll.c
 ).
...
net/core/netpoll.c: In function 'netpoll_poll':
net/core/netpoll.c:155: error: 'struct net_device' has no member named 'poll_controller'
net/core/netpoll.c:159: error: 'struct net_device' has no member named 'poll_controller'
net/core/netpoll.c: In function 'netpoll_setup':
net/core/netpoll.c:670: error: 'struct net_device' has no member named 'poll_controller'
make[2]: *** [net/core/netpoll.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [net/core] Error 2
make: *** [net] Error 2
make: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
...
I think is because KGDBOE selects just NETPOLL.
Regards,
Gabriel
