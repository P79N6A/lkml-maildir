Hi Ingo,
   Since the Gentoo Pro-Audio overlay guys were so quick to get
2.6.17-rc6-rt1 into an ebuild I downloaded and built the kernel this
evening using that method.
1) The kernel did boot on my AMD64 machine.
2) gdm segfaulted so I couldn't run X.
3) Basic functionality was available in a console window.
   I expect the gdm problem is on my end. Maybe it's a VGA driver
issue or something like that? I'll check that out tomorrow.
   Anyway, it does boot so that's a start.
Cheers,
Mark
