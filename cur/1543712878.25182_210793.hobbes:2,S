module_param*() ought indeed to suffice.
AFAICS the only problem here is that Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt
still lists lockd.udpport and lockd.tcpport instead of the new names
lockd.nlm_udpport and lockd.nlm_udpport.
There is also lockd.nlm_grace_period, and lockd.nlm_timeout, both of
which need to be added to the same list...
Cheers,
