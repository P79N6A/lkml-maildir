this device (the ich8 onboard NIC) will not be supported in e1000e until 2.6.25.

there have been indeed know reports of these "fake" hangs. basically the counter
logic for these newer devices reports hangs too quickly for 10/100 speeds while
they actually are not occurring (the line is just very busy).
The fix for this has been to grant more time for the hardware to recover from this
busy state. I'll make sure to check if the upstream drivers are OK in this regard.
you can try our out-of-tree e1000 driver (7.6.x or newer) which should work OK for
you with respect to this problem. Please give that a try.
Cheers,
Auke
