That is an issue, but it is really only a minor one.
The real problem is that whereas the tuple (sb->s_dev,i_ino) suffices
in order to be able to iget() a typical ext2 file, you require the the
tuple (sb->s_dev, 32/64 byte opaque filehandle) if you want to
iget() an NFS file.
Basically, if you want to be able to recover gracefully from the
situation in which the re-exporting server reboots, you would need to
compress the entire filehandle from the original server + the
sb->s_dev (in some manner that survives a reboot, I'll grant you) and
fit that into the filehandle that the NFS client uses.
To complicate matters a bit further, you have the fact that NFSv3
filehandles are 0-64 bytes long, and NFSv2 filehandles are always 32
bytes long...
Cheers,
