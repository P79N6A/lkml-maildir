are you sure it's down_write() contention? down_read() can create
contention just as much, simply due to the fact that hundreds of threads
and a dozen CPUs are pounding in on the same poor lock.
i do think there should be a rw-semaphore variant that is per-cpu for
the read path. (This would also fix the 4:4 threading overhead.)
