Greetings!
I have been working with Xerox to identify a bug in the parallel port
code that appears to affect high-end laser printers.  Basically, the
behavior is this:
when using manual feed with a limited time-out, the printer crashes with
either an illegal instruction or a reboot after two or three jobs. 
There is also a possibly related problem with extremely slow print jobs,
but this one is not easily reproducible.
We have tracked this down to a linux 2.x kernel problem.  The problem
has been reproduced by Xerox on their color laser printers and also on a
Lexmark printer.  It only appears with linux 2.x kernels; WinNT does not
exhibit this behavior.  We have only tested this using a RH 5.2 and 6.0
system, but as the lp code is part of the kernel, it should affect all
distros.
This problem is reproducible across machines; Xerox has consistently
been able to reproduce it on two desktops and one laptop.
I understand that you may not be the right person to whom I should be
reporting this bug.  Please let me know the proper channels to report
this bug.
Thanks,
Yan Seiner
