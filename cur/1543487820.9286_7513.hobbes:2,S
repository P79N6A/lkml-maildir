Guys,
I just had to reboot my machine (Linux 2.2.2 i586 unknown) with the power
switch. :-(
I was starting an X session at the console, and logging into a networked
machine whose nfsroot is on the affected machine.  The X session logon
seemed to pause for a couple of seconds, and on the networked machine, nfs
messages like "server not responding, still trying" and "task can't get a
request slot" were appearing.
The X session logon then continued for another second or two, and then
stopped.  Moving the mouse (PS/2) had no effect.
I tried Alt-SysRq-S, then Alt-SysRq-U, and then Alt-SysRq-B, and each time
nothing happen, not even disk access.  When I hit the reset switch, the
BIOS didn't detect the keyboard (PS/2)---which explains why SysRq didn't
help me out. :-(
I powered off and on again, and the keyboard was detected again.  After
the machine had booted, the networked machine said "RPC: task already
queued!" and then "server OK", and it continued with logging me on.
This _kind_ of thing has happened before with this keyboard, just a few
days ago: the keyboard stops responding to things like CapsLock, and a
reset doesn't help.  It seems very much like a hardware problem to me.
(Aside: is it likely to be the keyboard, or the connector on the
motherboard?)
The previous time it happened, though, it didn't really affect me much, as
I could use the networked machine and carry on with what I was doing.
This is the first time that it's brought the system down.
Tim.
