Hi all,
I tried using lkcd on a ia64 machine running on 2.6.5-7.111 SuSe Kernel for
debugging. I configured the swap device as the dump device and I created
panics,oops to generate dumps. The dump happens in /var/log/dump on a "lkcd
save" after a reboot. When I use lcrash to trace the task of the process
that caused the dump, I get some data misalignment errors as listed below.
And interestingly this happens only for the trace of the process that
generated the panic/oops. For all other processes in the dump trace is
giving me the proper output. Looks like the issue is specific to ia64 as I
did not encounter any such errors on my i386 machine on the same kernel. 
Pointers to any patches or what the problem is will be of help to me.
