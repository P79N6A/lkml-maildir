I finally had time to try bisecting the problem I was having with cfs8
and master Sunday, and was able to eliminate the problem.
I had first done:
  clone
  branch
  checkout
  apply
  commit
  pull
If instead of pulling master into the cfs branch, I rather switch to the
master branch and pull the cfs branch into that, it works.
I'll try updating to the current master with v10 to confirm.
For those who want to follow, do:
#!/bin/sh
git clone -l -s -n \
 git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git \
 2.6.21-cfs-master
cd 2.6.21-cfs-master
git checkout -b git checkout -b cfs v2.6.21
git pull git://people.freedesktop.org/~cloos/cfs-2.6.git
git checkout master
git pull . cfs
The master branch of git://people.freedesktop.org/~cloos/cfs-2.6.git
has 2.6.21 with the sched-cfs-v10-v2.6.21.1.patch.  Cf gitweb at:
