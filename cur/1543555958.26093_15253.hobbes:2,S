Yes You are right. This Ether Express is integrated on the motherboard, so
we couldn't get it out totally :( But there isn't any cable connected to
it, we also doesn't have the driver in the kernel. This is the same with
the USB too. Do You mind, that they could have some kind of conflict just
on they own, without being really used?
Currently after changing the processors to Katmais, and disabling the
apic, and some of the other unused peripheries, it seems, that the system
is more stable. If the errors come again, I'll try to compile the USB
driver also.

Nope, specially we didn't get errors from the APIC himself. But both
network cards (except the EtherExpress) were saying errors considering to
interrupts.
3Com:
kernel: eth0: Interrupt posted but not delivered -- IRQ blocked by another
device?
kernel:   Flags; bus-master 1, full 0; dirty 112(0) current 112(0).
kernel:   Transmit list 00000000 vs. f20ac200.
kernel:   0: @f20ac200  length 80000036 status

kernel: eth0: Resetting the Tx ring pointer.

In interrupt handler - not syncing

Thanx for the USB patch, I'll try it also.
