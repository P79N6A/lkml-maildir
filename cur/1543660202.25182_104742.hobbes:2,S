no, this doesn't work when you have the source and object files _of
the module_ in separate directories. You'd have to run make in the
object directory, but there seems no way to tell it where the source
is. (At least I have not found any.)
The reason to do this is compiling one module for different kernel
configurations as well as compiling one kernel for different
configurations. I.e. I want to have a tree like this:
first the kernel:
/usr/src/linux/2.5.99/              this is directory X
/var/obj/linux/2.5.99/boxa          here is X compiled for boxa
/var/obj/linux/2.5.99/boxb          here is X compiled for boxb
(this doesn't work either at the moment, another bug/missing feature...)
then the external module:
/usr/src/cipe                       this is directory Y
/var/obj/cipe/2.5.99/boxa           here is Y compiled against X for boxa
/var/obj/cipe/2.5.99/boxb           here is Y compiled against X for boxb
and /usr/src might be mounted read-only.
