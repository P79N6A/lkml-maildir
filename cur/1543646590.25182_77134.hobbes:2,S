The onyl real problem BK creates here IMHO is its not possible to use BK
to maintain the true master tree of a piece of software, because like
everyone else Linux people get security reports/fixes which are set to
go out on specific dates by people like CERT. The BK rules prevent
anyone from checking a change into their BK tree until the embargo date,
which can be a pain in the butt.
Fortunately its not a problem to me because I don't use it 8)
