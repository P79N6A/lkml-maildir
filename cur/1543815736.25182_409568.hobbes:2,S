This is going to come up in the next release if we try to merge the 
framebuffer stuff.

We could make an exception for console devices and just have a small 
buffer in the hypervisor for console input/output (similar to the 
emergency console).  The biggest advantage to doing this IMHO is that it 
makes guest OS's a bit easier to port.  The console already is treated 
as an exception since it is setup in start_info (instead of through 
XenBus) so this is not that awful I think.
