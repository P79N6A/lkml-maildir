The way you implement bg scanning is to notify the ap you are going into 
power save mode before you leave the channel (in sta mode).  Hence bg 
scanning and power save operation interact.

See above.  Doing bg scanning well is a balancing act and restoring 
hardware state is the least of your worries (hopefully); e.g. what's the 
right thing to do when you get a frame to transmit while off-channel 
scanning, how often should you return to the bss channel?

Er, you need to listen to at least beacons from other ap's if you're in 
11g so you can detect overlapping bss and enable protection.  There are 
other ways to handle this but that's one.

Channel ordering is useful no matter who specifies it.  If you offload 
the ordering to the upper layers then they need to be aware of the 
regdomain constraints.  Probably not a big deal but then you need to 
synchronize info between layers or export it.  And there's other 
regdomain-related info that may want to be considered such as max 
txpower.  I'm just saying if you want to do a good job there's lots of 
work here.

I don't recall seeing well-developed scanning code in either of the 
proposed stacks.
