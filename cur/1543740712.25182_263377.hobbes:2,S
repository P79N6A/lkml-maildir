Ok, that patch just got lost.
Quite as well, actually. The whole point of changing remap_page_range() to 
remap_pfn_range() is to give the full range of page frame numbers, and 
just shifting "offset" back down thus seems to be a bug to me. Otherwise 
we migth as well just have continued with the old code.
