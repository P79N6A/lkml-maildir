Technically none (i.e. edit gcc specs or glibc includes). But persuading 
all distribution builders to use this version is impossible. Plus there 
are many binary programs that are unchangable.

I think the best solution would be to drop -EOVERFLOW on st_ino and let 
legacy 32-bit programs live with coliding inodes. They'll have anyway.
