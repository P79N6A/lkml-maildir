The NUMA scheduler work can trivially be converted into arbitrary
scheduler pools - they are not designed for dynamic modification
at the moment, but could be without too much effort I think.
Around 2.5.59 or so I posted a patch to rename them to pools, though
we had a few other things to sort out at the time. I might revive it
at some point - it's pretty simple.
