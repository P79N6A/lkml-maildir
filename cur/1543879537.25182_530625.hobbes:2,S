Yes, although it really should be sensitive to CONFIG_X86_PAE.

I suggest, for clarity and to minimize bloat:
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_PAE
# define PAGE_TABLE_SIZE	((2048+4)*4096)
#else
# define PAGE_TABLE_SIZE	((1024+1)*4096)
#endif
#define BOOTMEM_SIZE		(128*1024)
#define INIT_MAP_BEYOND_END	(BOOTMEM_SIZE+PAGE_TABLE_SIZE)
