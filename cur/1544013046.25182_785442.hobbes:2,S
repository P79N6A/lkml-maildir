Rant below (can be ignored):
  This single fix will cause a massive change to the open-osd
  initiator patchset, (18 patches), and resubmission .I made the mistake
  because this name originates from a file that all naming conventions
  are taken from the OSD standard text. However this is no excuse
  for using a well known Kernel construct name. I will fix it. And
  will be more careful in the future.
Thanks
