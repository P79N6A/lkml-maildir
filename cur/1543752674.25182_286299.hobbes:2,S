We're currently working in a slightly different direction, to try to
hide page-table implemention details from anything outside the page table
implementation.  Our goal is to be able to try out other page tables
(e.g., Liedtke's guarded page table) instead of the 2/3/4 level fixed
hierarchy.
We're currently working on a 2.6.10 snapshot; obviously we'll have to
roll up to 2.6.11 before releasing (and there are lots of changes
there because of the recent 4-layer page table implementation).
