I have an IBM A21P which has the same problem.
The controller is a PCI1450 (rev 03)
The symptoms are that insertion of a PCMCIA or Cardbus card causes the
machine to lock up: it is calling yenta_interrupt() a zillion times per
second.  Presumably the IRQ isn't getting cleared.
Disabling i82635 in config fixes it up.
2.5.70 does not lock up.  2.5.71 does lock up.
dmesg and .config are at
