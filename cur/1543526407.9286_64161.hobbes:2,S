That's not an issue.  Whenever we suspend processes because of lack of
free pages or due to write throttling, those processes are put into
sleep state and are not considered for running by the scheduler.  Waking
these processes up when the resources become available is the job of
whatever is managing that resource --- it's not a task scheduling
problem.
