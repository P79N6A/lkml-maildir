Ok, LVM1 is non-existant if that's what you're referring to. Really,
this replaces LVM1, but your statement WRT md still has merit. As for
md duplication, it has been stated already that a preferred approach
might be to send only core functionality bits for now, leaving that
out till that question can be addressed.
Let's take an initially critical look, both philisophically and
technically at this, but also keep an open mind. There /is/ a
difference.

notice, except I have to leave the driveway doing 60 MPH.
