It's an unfortunate side effect of how the generic IRQ layer was done.
The linux/irq.h head should only be used on platforms that make use of
the generic IRQ layer.
asm/irq.h is what should be included by drivers and the like that want
the IRQ interfaces.
I'm not saying this is a good situation, it's just the way it is.
