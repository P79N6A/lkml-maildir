We plan to remove the need to have multiple copies of drmlib.a and make
the kernel Makefile fully compatible with the 2.4 make system -- but we
haven't finished this work yet.  With this new work, however, the
end-user will still load a single module (e.g., tdfx.o), just like now.
(Loading a single kernel module is a significant win when dealing with
end users: there is no possibility of version skew or of having two
modules that were compiled with different options.)
Linus -- Please use your patch or Keith Owens' patch as a bandaid to
solve this problem until we can do it the right way.  Whatever patch you
select, please do *NOT* make drmlib into a separate helper module --
this will only lead to user confusion (especially since we'll move back
to a single-module solution soon).  From the user's standpoint, I'm not
concerned that you can't mix modules with in-kernel versions, since most
users don't do that [and we could fix the configuration file to prevent
this -- that's another way to bandage this problem that I'll send you a
patch for tomorrow].  I am very concerned that users will see us move
from 1 DRM module to 2 and then back to 1 -- that would be very
confusing for them.
