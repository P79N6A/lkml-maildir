Usually! pci_unregister_driver has nothing to do with module_exit(), unless
there is some rule which says that pci_unregister_driver may be called
from module_exit() only.

There must be normal subsystem locking which prevents you from such race.

Both calls to ->probe (& ->remove) must happen under same lock which
is used by pci_(un)register_driver. Driver expects that there is no
device registered after return from pci_unregister_driver, and
your if (try_module_get())... violates this - you simply skip call
to ->remove if module is in unloading state - although I see no reason
why you could not enter driver's ->remove function long before
pci_unregister_driver is called.
Also pci_unregister_driver() expects ->remove to be called for all
registered devices. If you'll guard this call by try_module_get(),
no device will get unregistered from driver, causing memory leaks or
even crashes.
Well, and after reading sysfs code: there is no problem (I would be
really surprised otherwise), as both hotplug event and driver 
registration/removal are guarded by bus->subsys.rwsem semaphore, 
so pci_unregister_driver() succeeds after previous ->remove 
(or ->probe or ...) finishes.
Just make sure that people do not call device_release_driver
unless they really know what they are doing. Proper interface is
bus_remove_device or bus_remove_driver...
