Well, that's one thing. 2.4 will not need userspace changes internally, so
any funky major/minor number dynamic allocation stuff needs to be solved
without userspace help. This probably rules out most everything, unless a
setup is found that will special case all of /dev/ currently existing.
So I would think that this block of new major number allocations holds for
2.5 and not 2.4. Also, if I'm correct, 2.4 won't be needing a lot of new
major numbers anyhow.
This all means that a lot of the current hubbub is unjustified - 2.5 is not
there yet. Yes there is urgency and this way of forcing discussion is a very
Linus-eque way of trying to achieve something.
But unless I'm wrong, there is no way that this can affect a 2.4 without
userspace changes which have historically been considered forbidden within a
stable series.

bert
