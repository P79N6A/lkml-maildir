Here is my feeble input to this.
2.0.xx had a SecureLevel. It was implemented in the /proc file system. Once
it was set to non-zero, you could not change the immutable flag. It also
looked like you could not load modules once the securelevel was set to
non-zero. The original implementation set the flags for it to 444. Just for
grins, I changed this to 644 and wrote to it. This worked. Unfortunately,
the code for securelevel strategy is kind of broken because I could set it
back to 0 after it had been elevated. At this point I quit looking at it.
I went through the 2.2.x code looking at this. It now uses the CAPABILITY
which I don't understand at all. The only reference I could find to
capabilities was in reference to ELF file headers.
I would be interested in whatever you find out.

Subject: Immutable file bug
I was looking into how security levels are implemented in linux and I
stumbled on what I think is a bug.
An immutable file can still be touched to change its date. I'm not really
sure if immutable should prohibit that but I think so (since you can't
change permissions on an immutable file) and I think it should.
I traced it to sys_utime() and sys_utimes() in fs/open.c and patched it
there. But after seing directories turning into files (spooky) i tried
again and patched inode_change_ok() in fs/attr.c.
Oh, and a question: does linux even *have* security levels? I assumed it
did since it has immutable files but people say it doesn't have it.
IMPORTANT NOTE:
This patch works for me but am sure Linus will beat me silly for patching
absolutely wrong.
