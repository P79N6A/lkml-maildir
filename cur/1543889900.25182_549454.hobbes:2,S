No it is NOT a bug.
It simply shows again that you don't know how b44, ssb or anything related works.
Would you _please_ take a look at the code, before calling features bugs.
And yes, this IS a feature. It is a feature to get b44 running on an OpenWRT
embedded device. These devices don't have a PCI bus. So b44 MUST NOT depend
on "EISA, VLB, PCI and on board controllers".
"Broadcom 4400 PCI device support" does depend on "EISA, VLB, PCI and on board controllers".
Everything is correct.
Bug number 1 is solved.

And it's completely impossible that you did a mistake when configuring
the device? Typo in the IP? Typo in the gateway or DNS entries?
Try it again, please.
And please try with current wireless-dev tree.
And I simply do not get it why you suddenly get a good IRQ number, like everybody
else does, without fixing The Bug (tm).
