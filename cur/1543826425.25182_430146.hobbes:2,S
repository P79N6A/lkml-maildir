Hi, (first post)
I am trying to trace system calls (entry + exit) on x86_64 architecture, 
so I am basically working on arch/x86_64/kernel/entry.S and 
arch/x86_64/ia32/ia32entry.S (for 32-bit compatibility).  I want to test 
that my code works for all possible ways to enter a system call, which 
are (to my knowledge) the three following instructions:
- int $0x80
- sysenter
- syscall
So these three ways in, used in a 32 or 64 bits executable, makes 6 
possible ways to enter a system call that I need to test.  However, I 
have problems:
- sysenter/32 bits, executed on a 32 bit machine: I get a segfault on 
the sysenter instruction.  I use the following code to enter the system 
call:
pid_t getpid32()
{
    pid_t resultvar;
    asm volatile (
    "push    %%ebp\n\t"
    "push    %%ecx\n\t"
    "push    %%edx\n\t"
    "mov     %%esp,%%ebp\n\t"
    "sysenter\n\t"
    ".space 20,0x90\n\t"
    "pop     %%edx\n\t"
    "pop     %%ecx\n\t"
    "pop     %%ebp\n\t"
    : "=a" (resultvar)   
    : "0" (__NR_getpid)
    : "memory");
    return resultvar;
}
Is there something wrong in the way I pass the parameters?  I know this 
instruction can be tricky because of the way it messes different 
registers...
- int $0x80/64 bits: All system calls return -1 (EINTR).  Is there 
something wrong in the way I call it:
pid_t getpid64()
{
    pid_t resultvar;
    asm volatile (
    "int $0x80\n\t"
    : "=a" (resultvar)   
    : "0" (__NR_getpid)
    : "memory");
    return resultvar;
}
- sysenter/64 bits: I get an illegal instruction.  I've read that it's 
not implemented on AMD-64 (which is what I have).  Is there ANY x86_64 
machine on which this instruction is implemented?  Does this mean that 
the code that handles this case in entry.S has never been run?
- syscall/64 bits: works fine
- int $0x80/32 bits: works fine
- syscall/32 bits: illegal instruction, but I guess that's all right 
because of the machine I use.
Can someone help with any of my issues (entering a system call with 
sysenter/32 bits, int $0x80/64 bits or sysenter/64 bits)?
Thanks in advance,
Mart
P.S.  First post on this list, please reply in private if I did 
something wrong so that I won't do it again.
