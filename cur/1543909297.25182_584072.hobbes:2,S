I am not sure what you mean by that. Ia64 ZONE_DMA == x86_84 ZONE_DMA32?

If you have gotten rid of all slab users of GFP_DMA (and also all arch 
uses of it) then we can drop the code in SLAB.

The s390 arch code still contains GFP_DMA uses? No drivers elsewhere 
still use GFP_DMA?

Right. So we could
1. Drop sl?b support for GFP_DMA.
2. Drop GFP_DMA32 support.
Then we only allow page allocator allocs using GFP_DMA? That may be the 
least invasive for arch code.
