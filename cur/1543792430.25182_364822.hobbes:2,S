Summary: Poor performance of b44 driver
Description: I'm getting a transfer rate of 3 MB/s between two machines on the 
same 100 Mbit lan. Using Broadcom's bcm4400 driver (which I believe is GPL), 
I get 10 MB/s.
Kernel Version: 2.6.13 (vanilla) on a P4
I noticed when this problem was occurring, I frequently see the network 
interface going down and then up again in the logs. Other than swapping out 
the modules, I haven't done any other testing - so let me know if you need 
anything else.
