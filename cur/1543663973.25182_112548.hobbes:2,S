Hi,
With tg3 from 2.4.19 the Recieve/Transmit-bytes entries grow to 4294967295, 
but then stay at this value. This isn't the expected behaviour, is it? All 
other net drivers will jump back to zero and count up again, won't they?
Is there a patch available?
Otherwise 2.4.19's tg3 seems pretty stable to me, as it's running since 2002 
Oct. 7th with no problems...
Christian
