Oh...do we know the "sizes" of all child resources from the bus walk?
I'll check that and see if it can be safely changed.

Nope - don't call that for A500 (machines with PDC PAT)...that might in
fact be another problem later related to some PDC (aka BIOS) changes.

Yup - I think you are right on all counts here.
I'll rework the parisc code tonight/tomorrow and see if I can get rid
of the contentious generic PCI changes. I should be able to.

Linux doesn't. It's possible to deal with window register size in
the initial bus walk (where BAR sizes are determined).

The alignment would have to be handled correctly and I thought
pcibios_align_resource() did that. I see now the arch/parisc one doesn't
and others probably don't either. Let me think about this more...

np. thanks.

Ditto for parisc.

Agreed.
