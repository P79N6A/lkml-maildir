Well, no, you don't have to modify everything that might modify resolv.conf.
You do have to define your policy so that the set of things that might
modify resolv.conf is limited to the set of things that are appropriate.
You also need to note that SELinux has a notion of privilege that is
different from what is traditional. The ability to modify resolv.conf
is determined by the domain containing it and the relationship of the
domain containing the application to that domain, modified by any
domain transitions that may have occured to the process prior to or
during the attempted access.

For SELinux to be effective it has to have a complete policy definition.
This would prevent the OpenOffice access (unless OpenOffice is in the
modify_resolv_conf_t domain) above.
This, by the way, is a fundimental advantage of a path scheme over a
label scheme in that label schemes require every object be labeled
(it's Section 3.1.1.3 of the TCSEC if you want to look it up) while a
path scheme (in the absences of a published requirement) only requires
those names it cares about. SELinux in the absence of a correct and
complete policy could be considered dangerous.
