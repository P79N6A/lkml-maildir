Hello,

   The resource regions should be IMNSHO unshareable.
   If you want to share some hardware between several drivers, the right
way is to build a meta-driver (like we do for parallel ports) which
will sub-allocate the device and arbitrate accesses (which must be
done in a device-dependent way).
