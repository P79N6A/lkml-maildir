OK, looking back through the perf results, these two graphs clearly show
a perf regression in reaim7 from 2.6.15 to 2.6.16-rc1. We're loosing 
over 50% of the performance.

Drilling down (there's not enough detail on the graphs for releases that
far back), I see it's actually between -git5 and -git6
These are both ia-32 NUMA machines, one is an x440, the other is NUMA-Q.
