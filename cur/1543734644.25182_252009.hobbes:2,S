Well, that would speed it up, but the catastrophe was avoided in the
older patches by just processing all the hits for one cpu at a time,
and the buffering methods above for your suggested accounting
structures likely work well enough the overhead of processing unused
portions of the bitmap can be ignored. I don't really want to go about
addressing performance issues besides effective or actual
nontermination for this code, and would rather leave highly efficient
methods to oprofile (in fact, some others believe that even bugfixes
for such issues should be ignored for kernel/profile.c, contrary to my
notion that it shouldn't crash systems regardless of their size).
