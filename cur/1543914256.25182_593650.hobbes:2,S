Yes, it prevents the cpu to enter C2, which keeps the local APIC alive.

Ok, I got my brain together and read through the code. The periodic mode
switches to broadcast right away when the acpi code discovers that there
is a lapic stops C-State available.
Does the test hack below fix the problem for nohz/highres enabled
kernels ?
