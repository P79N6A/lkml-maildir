It's bug to bug compatibility with 2.0. If you never rename ip aliases
manually and always create the "main" device first it is actually
not too unobvious.

The information is actually exported to user space via the ifaddrmsg 
flags in rtnetlink, but not displayed currently by iproute2.

It is an nasty hack, but needed to not void all the documentation and scripts
that rely on the old 2.0 alias behaviour.
If you want to avoid it only use ifconfig add/del or ip addr add/del..
to create aliases; never named ip aliases. They're deprecated, but
unfortunately still quite popular.
