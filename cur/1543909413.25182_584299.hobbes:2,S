I think that makes a lot of sense, and to be honest other MSG_ flags make
useful sense and have meaningful semantics that might be helpful
elsewhere if ever coded that way.
If you want to do this the first job is going to be to sort out the way
non-block is propogated to device driver read/write handlers. At the
moment they all check filp->f_flags
