Hi all,
I got some mails regarding my first mail and I'll try to respond to the 
feedback...

Yes, but that was the box that was available for testing currently. 
Thats life :-)

Yes, I could do that (using WPCREDIT), but I'd like to know that it 
would be helpful to some kernel hackers first, so mail me and I'll do it.
If someone *is* interested, I'll dump bus0,dev0,func0 (Host Bridge) and 
bus0,dev1,func0 (PCI-PCI bridge) with and without patches installed, is 
there any other device that should be included (like IDE-controller)?

I did try with the latest VIA patch applied (it gave approx 4Mb/s in 
increase). However, some more research has uncovered yet more hardware 
issues that may (in combination with the VIA issues) be the "real" 
perpetrator.
Apparently (by looking at the links at the end of this mail), SeaGate 
Barracuda IV's and RAID is a big mistake. I will RMA the drives and buy 
some other brand before I continue benchmarking the 2400A card.
Thanks to Mark, Dieter and Ville.
Regards,
David
