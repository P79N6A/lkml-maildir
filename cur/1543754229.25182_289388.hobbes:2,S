oops. i overlooked this line. so, the fix becomes minor improvement patch ;)
thanks!
do you think the following can be improved?
	/*
	 * @@@ AKPM: This seems rather over-defensive.  We're giving commit
	 * a _lot_ of headroom: 1/4 of the journal plus the size of
	 * the committing transaction.  Really, we only need to give it
	 * committing_transaction->t_outstanding_credits plus "enough" for
	 * the log control blocks.
	 * Also, this test is inconsitent with the matching one in
	 * journal_extend().
