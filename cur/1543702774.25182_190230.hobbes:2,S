That would be heartbeat failure, no carrier, and loss of carrier. It's
interesting that you seem to be able to get valid packets on the wire
because the latter two errors are usually quite fatal. I suspect either
the Comet is just buggy and those error bits aren't to be trusted or
there is something wrong with the PHY config. I don't have docs on the
Comet PHY so there's not much I can do.
On whim, does the patch below change anything for you?
