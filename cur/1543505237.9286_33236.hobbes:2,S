Umm... this is getting annoying
2.2.11-pre4 for 3 days... /var has needed fscking twice
ext2_new_block: Free blocks count corrupted for block group blah
going to pre 7 today maybe
again for the masses who have missed my previous posts
this is an smp box with half gig of ram,  AIC7xxx and SYM53c8xx support
(the adaptec chipset seems to be a recurring problem with fs
corruption??)  /var hangs off the sym53c8xx board though
mobo is a asus piib-ds.
These are brand new segate UW drives and should not be throwing errors
like this.  I don't know what to do here... I need a stable box and am
not getting one :?  Every 2.2.x kernel has furked the box in one way or
another
