Hi,
Your question is now becoming FAQ so maybe someone should register it as
such. Anyway, here is the answer (I hope my Outbox doesn't wear the disk
out by re-sending the same message over and over again :)
There are three kernel debuggers and one useful utility available at the
moment:
1. 
http://reality.sgi.com/slurn_engr/
2. 
ftp://ftp.gcom.com/pub/linux/src/kgdb-2.2.6/
3. 
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/linux/patch-ikd-arca/
4.

Regards,
Tigran.
