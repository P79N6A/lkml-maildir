True enough.  I started rpc.klockd from knfsd-981204 but then I ran
into the next problem:

Any idea what might cause this problem?  Is it a common one?

`statd' was running as root.

|

`knfsd-981204' comes with little installation information.  I
found that following the instructions in `INSTALL' doesn't work.  Is 
the package supposed to be un-tarred inside the linux src diretory (I
didn't do this)?  Any help with installing `knfsd-981204' on RH5.2 w/
2.2.0-prex would be greatly appreciated.
Here's some info on what I did do:
To install the package, I resorted to this:
    % gmake 
    % gmake install
I've just now realized that I didn't use the etc/rc.* files.  Also, I
still have these packages installed:
    nfs-server-2.2beta37-1
    nfs-server-clients-2.2beta37-1
The first one provides the old init script:
    /etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs
And I was also running this one from initscripts-3.78-1:
    /etc/rc.d/init.d/nfsfs 
Changing these scripts may make quite a difference.  I'll reboot and
see what happens.
