	Hi,
	According to Andrew's must-fix list:
"32bit uid support is *still* broken for process accounting."
	Ok, so I went and tried to see why we can't just use uid_t/gid_t for 
the uid, gid fields on struct acct.
	I saw the GNU acct source, and it uses unsigned int fields on the hash 
tabels and doesn't assume any 16-bit only fields on the acct structure.
	So, it seems to me that the only reason we still have broken 32-bit 
process accounting is so that old tools can behave nicely. Please tell 
me other reasons as I couldn't find them.
	There are 2 patches attached.
	The first, does the obvious uid_t/gid_t replacement..since it defines 
16/32-bits for UIDs on a per-architecture basis.
	The second, uses CONFIG_UID16 as a basis for forcing 16-bit UIDs.
	I'd like to request review of these patches and pointers on what I'm 
missing to get this problem fixed.
	Thanks,
Felipe
