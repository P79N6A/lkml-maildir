Gaah. I should do a "git-clone-script" or something that does this, and 
then you could just do
	git clone rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git linux-2.6
Anybody?

A few notes on these things:
	git-apply --index /tmp/my.patch
will not only apply the patch (unified patches only!), but will do the
index updates for you while it's at it, so if the patch contains new files
(or it deletes files), you don't need to worry about it.
Also, you can do
	git commit <list-of-files-to-commit>
as a shorthand for
	git-update-cache <list-of-files-to-commit>
	git commit
which some people will probably find more natural.

Or, perhaps preferably:
	git diff HEAD
since that is shorter ad will also show renames.

No, if you just want the changesets listed, then
	git log
is a lot better, since it shows merges.
"git-whatchanged" is useful if you actually want to see what the commits 
_changed_, and then you often want to use the "-p" flag to see it as 
patches. Also, it's worth pointing out the fact that you can limit it to 
certain subdirectories (or individual files) etc, ie:
	git-whatchanged -p drivers/net
since that is often what people want.
But if you just want the log, "git log" is faster and simpler and more 
correct.

Again, I think is possibly more naturally expressed with "git diff":
	git diff master..HEAD
which just says "show the differences from 'master' to 'HEAD'" and will
also show renames etc.
(A plain "git diff" will show just the difference to the index file, in 
case you care).
