Hi,
Being in bed recovering from surgery is surely enough to drive anyone  
nuts so I decided to go after double semi-colons, to kill off a couple  
hours and try to maintain mental sanity ;-)
Since the big patch is rather, well, big -- touching 78 files -- I split  
it into smaller chunks, one per each directory it applies to, to make it  
easier to review/merge. It is against 2.4.27-pre2 but applies cleanly to  
-pre3, just checked and rediffed the chunks that failed.
I'm sending off a separate mail to cleanup the few remaining cases in  
2.6, too.
Please review.
