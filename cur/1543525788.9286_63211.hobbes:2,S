Sorry for being dumb, but:
1. Ain't the practice of writing over your args (though widely accepted) bad as
an idea. So the kernel should not care and actually ignore the misbehaving
programs.
2. It seems more reasonable to move set_progname from libpub into glibc, make
it a standard and make it operate via proc. And let it be the legal way of
changing things. If you want to change the progname you have a valid interface,
why mess with argv.
Cheers ;-)
