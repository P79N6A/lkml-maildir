/proc/kcore is what you need, but it is broken on ia64 (and
has been since the dawn of time for access to region 5) because
it assumes that all kernel virtual addresses are above PAGE_OFFSET.
This isn't true on ia64, VMALLOC_START is smaller than PAGE_OFFSET.
Attached is a patch (applies to 2.4.19 and to 2.5.39) that fixes the
assumption.  After applying you'll be able to use:
	# gdb vmlinux /proc/kcore
and happily ask gdb to examine addresses in region 5.

Subject: [Linux-ia64] Debugger/Analysis tool for IA64 Kernel Reg 5
Hi,
    I'm wondering if there is a tool available (gdb or some crash
analysis
tool) that can be used to disassemble/dump region 5 pages? We recently
have ported LiS and OpenSS7 stacks to IA-64 and it was painful without
being able to debug the Reg 5 memory, but we'll still be doing more
work.
We currently just have a crude tool that gets the reg 7 address from a
reg 5 address and then we use gdb, this is pretty cumbersome.....
- Mario.
