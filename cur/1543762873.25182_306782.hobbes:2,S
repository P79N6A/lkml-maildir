I like to let you know that this was all I got as dump. Was simply
trying to copy some stuff from A to B on my harddisk using MC on a XFS
partition using 2.6.11.6.
Though I also detected another really strange thing together with this
issue. On a valid XFS partition (no errors or something) I tried to
delete about 160 CVS checked out modules (GNOME) and *buff* stuff
couldn't be deleted anymore but I wasn't aware of this at that moment.
Seconds later I was trying to copy stuff from A to B as described above
and this gave me that hit. Luckely the hit caused let me continue using
the System. I then tried to delete the stuff again and noticed that it
hadn't deleted the CVS checkout in A) properly and that I copied the
undeleted stuff to B) as well. I then inserted my own created rescue CD,
mounted the partition again, and voila was able to delete the stuff
xfs_repair check on it gave no errors or something.
Maybe this helps isolating the issue.
