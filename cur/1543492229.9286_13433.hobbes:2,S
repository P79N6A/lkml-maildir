I have a device driver (which I did not write) which looks up pte
translations so it can access user space memory directly.  The
assumption than the memory is locked is safe.
It does this so that an interrupt routine is able to play with the user
space memory.  After the lookup, the correct memory is accessed even
when the MMU context is changed.
To play nice with those nice m68k and sparc64 systems, is there an
equivalent that the device driver should be using?
Thanks,
