The eepro100 has a unique design in many different aspects.

With the current driver structure, yes, the descriptor words must be
immediately before the packet data.  You can use other Rx and Tx
structures/modes to avoid this, but they use less efficient memory access.
For instance, the current Tx structure allows transmitting a packet with
a single PCI burst, rather than multiple transfers.
