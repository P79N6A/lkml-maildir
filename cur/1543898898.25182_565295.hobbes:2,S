I think you want to stick try_to_freeze() at the same places where you
do SIGKILL handling. That should solve the 'syslogd is unfreezeable'
problem.
Plus, it would be nice to find out where suspend/hibernation is
triggering fuse activity. We can then decide where to fix it -- in
fuse or in suspend parts. You said sys_sync is not implemented... so
where is the problem?

Well, unix is not plan9, and maybe userland filesystems are impossible
in unix. But that is hardly a bug in unix :-).
