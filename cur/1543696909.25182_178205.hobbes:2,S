Subject: Why "PCI: Cannot allocate resource region..."?

I didn't get any response to my previous query, so I figured I'd ask a
simpler question: why would the kernel say that it cannot allocate a
memory-mapped I/O resource?
I looked at /proc/iomem, and none of the regions in question overlap
with any other device's regions, which presumably means the BIOS is
doing a good job configuring the devices.  So, again: for what reasons
*does* the kernel decide it can't do the allocation?  This would
greatly help my debugging efforts.
Thanks,
Kyle
