Neither have you, at least aside from hand-waving. I've actually built a
bunch of systems that were originally spec'ed to be hybrids. Wouldn't be
surprised if Mark had too, given his Nortel address.

And that alternative sucks. Think scalability.

And your shared fs alternative sucks. Think abysmal disk throughput for
the rest of the system. Think starvation. Think all the reasons we've been
trying to clean up the elevator code times ten. And that's just for the
device queue, never mind the deadlock avoidance problems. See "priority
inversion".

Umm, neither can your CD player. But if you take the proper precautions to
avoid it being jostled, clean your discs, and give it decent buffering, it
will be more than satisfactory. Can we bring Linux up to the same
standard with the pre-empt and low-latency approaches? Yes. Is this a
better approach than grafting quixotic kernels onto the side of the box?
Definitely.
There is a place for hard realtime. But desktop MP3 playing is not it.
