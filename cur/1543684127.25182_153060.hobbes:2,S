That's strange. I've tested perfctr-generated interrupts through
the local APIC on Opteron, and they work with the perfctr driver.
Two things you might want to test:
- In case the unofficial event 0x76 really doesn't work in your
  version of the chip, try this event specifier instead: it
  creates a clock-like event using an inverted threshold approach.
  I've tested this on K8 and P6 with the perfctr driver. The event
  code (0xC0) is immaterial, 0x00 and 0xFF work equally well.

- My perfctr driver routes interrupts through LVTPC programmed for
  Fixed delivery mode. Maybe the NMI delivery mode is broken. You
  could try changing the NMI watchdog to use a new vector and Fixed
  delivery mode, just to see if the watchdog starts ticking.
