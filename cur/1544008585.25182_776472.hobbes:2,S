2.6.27-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Bernhard Walle <bwalle@suse.de>
commit 290172e79036fc25a22aaf3da4835ee634886183 upstream.
When the "hpwdt" module is loaded (even if the /dev/watchdog device is not
opened), then kdump does not work. The panic kernel either does not start at
all or crash in various places.
The problem is that hpwdt_pretimeout is registered with register_die_notifier()
with the highest possible priority. Because it returns NOTIFY_STOP, the
crash_nmi_callback which is also registered with register_die_notifier()
is never executed. This causes the shutdown of other CPUs to fail.
Reverting the order is no option: The crash_nmi_callback executes HLT
and so never returns normally. Because of that, it must be executed as
last notifier, which currently is done.
So, that patch returns NOTIFY_OK to keep the crash_nmi_callback executed.
