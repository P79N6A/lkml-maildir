Adding a second interface maybe more confusing to drivers and non-pid
users.
But more importantly, modifying find_pid() to refer to only init_pid_ns
would require auditing existing find_pid() callers and switching them to
find_vpid().
For instance if capset() is called from a child pid namespace, the 'pid'
would refer to the pid or pgid from child pid ns. But cap_set_pg() calls
find_pid() which gets the number from init_pid_ns.
Is there a similar issue with sunos_killpg() ?
