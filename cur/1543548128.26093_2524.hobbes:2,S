once there, in:
(MEC-4) Standardize the post-vmlinux targets.
     Actually I think Keith subsumes this with "make an installable
     system".  I'd like all the elements of this system to go into
     documented places with standardized architecture-independent
     names.  In D.M., the vmlinux file and bzImage file and System.map
     go into a target directory named "boot/".
Could we make it _easy_ to put all the
modules/System.map/bzImage/<whatever> in boot/ and make it easy to do
a tar of that directory and make easy to install that dir in another
machine (perhaps puting a tiny Makefile/script there to do that).
Just my 2 pesetas :))
Later, Juan.
