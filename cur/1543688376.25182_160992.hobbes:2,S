I'm probably of no use to you at all, but there's a slight chance that you're suffering from the same problem as I did a while ago... Since two CPU's at 100MHz consume less power than at 133MHz, it just might be that your PSU doesn't deliver enough power, you could messure the voltages and check this... I've suffered from that problem, buying a more powerfull 350W PSU *really* helped me...
Of course there's also a chance that it's somewhat software related... ;-)
