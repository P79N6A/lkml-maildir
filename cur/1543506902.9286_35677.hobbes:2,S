I sincerely hope that v3 will be included as is seem to work
_that_ much better than v2. I added Tronds client patch to my 2.2.11-ac3 
kernel yesterday and the NFS performance gain was dramatic.
I'm mounting a couple of disks from a Solaris 7 server via an aDSL
connection. With v2 I got NFS transfer rates around 500 kb/s and now
with v3 I seem to get the full 4 Mb/s of the aDSL-link !
Regards.
