I'm not sure that would be fine.  In the situation you describe, not setting
this bit means the second core won't receive interrupts.  If we crash on that
core and boot the kdump kernel with it, we get exactly the same problem that we
currently see.

I suppose I can, but I'm not sure what benefit that provides.  Can you
elaborate?

I can fix that up.  I'll hold off though until ben redoes all his testing.  He
mentioned earlier this morning, that some of the results he was getting may have
been caused by a kexec utility bug.  He's re-confirming that this patch solves
the reported problem.  Once he does, I'll repost.
Thanks & Regards
