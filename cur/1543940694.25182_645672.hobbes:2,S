Sorry If I am re-inventing the wheel.
At first this looked like under-utilization. Letting only batchers and
ELV_MQUEUE_MUST tasks to allocate upto 150% of nr_requests, which is in
someway equivalent of setting nr_requests at 150% and keeping 1/3 of it
reserved for batchers. But we are actually jamming the queue only when
required and allowing it to be just full otherwise! But this patch will
never over-fill the queue.

Another way to honor the nr_requests limit strictly would be to set it
at 66.6% of the real value, so that we never exceed the limit ;-)
But even with the token, if we reach 150% the task goes to
uninteruptible sleep. But with the patch, the task will not sleep in
get_request, unless memory allocation fails. Will this skew the
performance or atleast the performance numbers?

hmm.. The patch is not completely finished yet. Just posted early to
know if this was considered already. Also I do not have good
test-cases. 
A system was getting sporadic delays when copying huge files. And I
doubted the ioc_batching code, and started working on this patch. I have
made noop & cfq to fill both the read and write queues only now, the
patch I sent yesterday will stop dispatching if it cannot dispatch the
request it chooses, leading to under-utilization. Also I guess, the
schedulers are tweaked/optimized for the ioc_batching logic, which has
to be tweaked for this, to make a real comparison.
Do you still think that, this option is not worth trying? If so I will
try to find ways to improve the ioc_batching logic
