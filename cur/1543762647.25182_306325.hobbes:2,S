Sorry, I don't understand your scenarios.  Can you explain the
circumstances under which you see corruption?
From the kernel messages you've quoted above, I can only think that
you're not using ttyS0 as the serial console - if you were, my
understanding of this issue would indicate that you should get the
garbage immediately after the line starting "Serial:"
Either my understanding of the cause of this problem is wrong, or
I'm not understanding your setup.
