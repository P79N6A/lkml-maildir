I think the real problem is an open source question.  The RTAI and RTLINUX folks 
are not exactly in the same camp (either with each other OR with LINUX) in this 
regard.  Should that change and one or more of these become truly open source 
without others claiming "foul", there are vendors who are ready and willing to 
work with the code.  Vendors of open source (and their customers) don't want to 
find themselves in law suits...
As such, this is really off topic...  as is a discussion of the merits of this 
sort of solution.  On this list we are interested in working in the confines of 
LINUX as found on linux.org possibly modified by truly open source patches and 
packages.
