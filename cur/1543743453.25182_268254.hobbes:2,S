icmp/ping replies are handled by ksoftirqd. Once a networking request
has been handed to ksoftirqd it cannot be redirected to another CPU,
because softirq processing is fundamentally per-CPU. So if the network
interrupt hits the CPU where the RT-task is running then the RT task
will starve that ksoftirq instance (and hence the reply) even if another
CPU in the system is idle.
i agree that this is an SMP/RT artifact that should be fixed. hardirq
workload can be redirected to other CPUs because it's single-threaded,
but it's not that easy for softirq workload.
i suspect the same phenomenon causes some of the other scheduling
artifacts ('frozen' X) you've noticed.
