Hi,
As we reported in [1], Linux 2.6.(2|3) doesnt boot on sparc64. We traced the
problem back to some changes in arch/sparc64/kernel/head.S (2.6.3 does
boot with 2.6.1's head.S).
[1] http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=107643106916202&w=2
output :
Allocated 8 Megs of memory at 0x4000000 for kernel
Loaded kernel version 2.6.3    <--- SILO message
Illegal Instruction
{0} ok 
After a discussion with Ben Collins, it seems that only UltraSparc I are
affected. Could somebody check the new head.S's assembly code ? We are a
bit short here on sparc64 ASM...
Please tell us how we can help.
Thank you,
