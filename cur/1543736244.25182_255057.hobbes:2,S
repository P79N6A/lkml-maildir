I got the impression that the whole point of the problem is that the
kernel is getting some wrong information about the memory configuration.
Is there any way to check which information exactly is wrong that leads to
the error and to see after that, where this information comes from: if the
BIOS is lying or if the kernel is misinterpreting something...
