 both of them. this call is used by the dev interface
 but might also be used by any in-kernel user (there are none
 at the moment, but we might have them in the future).
 the same kind of check is done in rtc_set_time()
 for the same reason.
 however, the dev interface (RTC_ALM_SET)
 sets some of the tm fields to -1, which is
 invalid for rtc_valid_tm. 
 I haven't thought of this when I suggested to Andrew Victor
 to add this rtc_valid_tm call.
 so we might have to remove this call or to modify
 rtc_valid_tm to detect this. 
 suggestions?
