huh?
If the fix is correct, we need to do a bombing run that adds the 
following code to each driver,
	if (!netif_device_present(dev))
		return IRQ_HANDLED;
but of course the irq _wasn't_ handled by the driver.  Silly, isn't it?
I still maintain it needs to be fixed elsewhere.  Touching every driver 
for this is just not scalable, in addition to pointing the finger at the 
pcmcia core instead of individual drivers.
