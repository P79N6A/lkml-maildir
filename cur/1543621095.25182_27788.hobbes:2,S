AFAIK the help text for choice entries has _always_ been implemented the 
way you observed - a single entry with the name of the first choice, which 
helps you decide what to choose - not individual entries for each possible 
choice.
It looks like the current Configure.help is broken. I suggest you submit 
patches to correct it.
