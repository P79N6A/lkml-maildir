True.  But please add and remove mm outside of the task_lock,
there's no need to nest page_table_lock within it, is there?

I don't understand why you want to avoid taking mm->page_table_lock
in that special rare case.  I do prefer the sloppy rss approach, but if
you're trying to be exact then it's regrettable to leave sloppy corners.
Oh, is it because page_add_anon_rmap is usually called with page_table_lock,
but without in your do_anonymous_page case?  You'll have to move the
anon_rss incrementation out of page_add_anon_rmap to its callsites
(I was being a little bit lazy when I sited it in that one place,
it's probably better to do it near mm->rss anyway.)

No, "current" is not nearly so easy to play with as that.
See i386.  Even if it were, you might get burnt for heresy.

No.

We all seem to have different favourites.  Your favourite makes
quite a few people very angry.  We've been there, we've done that,
we've no wish to return.  It'd be fine if just the process which
wants to know paid the price; but it's every other that has to pay.

I didn't understand that bit.

Not studied in depth, but... am I going mad, or is your impressive
RCUing the wrong way round?  While we're scanning the list of tasks
sharing the mm, there's no danger of the mm vanishing, but there is
a danger of the task vanishing.  Isn't it therefore the task which
needs to be freed via RCU, not the mm?
