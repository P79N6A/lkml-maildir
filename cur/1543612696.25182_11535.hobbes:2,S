David Egolf and his colleages from Bull noticed that a pretty crucial
test was dropped by me when redesigning SYSV shm and tmpfs. If you
give an address to shmat it no longer checks if there is already a
mapping and happily maps it unconditionally at the given address. This
should only happen with the SHM_REMAP flag.
The appended patch reintroduces the necessary checks.
Please apply
