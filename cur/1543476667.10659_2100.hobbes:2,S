du counts the actual number of disk blocks in use.  Presumably,
"attributes," "filter," "headers," and "posted" are files with
holes in them; the software that created them wrote one block
near the end of the file, and maybe some near the middle; because
no other blocks were written, the filesystem didn't feel the need
to allocate them.  If the application asks for a chunk it hasn't
written to, the filesystem will simply return a buffer full of
zeros; when the application finally does write some data there,
then the filesystem will allocate the blocks to that file.
