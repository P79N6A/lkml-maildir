Hmmm....   I think that readprofile isn't using the right System.map.  When 
that happens to me, I've usually forgotten to update the symlink.  The 
default map file used is either  /usr/src/linux/System.map  or 
/boot/System.map
Quick check:   readprofile -m /boot/system.map_for_my_kernel
If that is the problem, this should print some useful results.
