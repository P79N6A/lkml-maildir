I am running the 2.2.12 kernel compiled from the source from RedHat's 
rpm kernel-source-2.2.12-20.  I also have v0.91  tulip driver. I find
that after my machine is up for several hour connections to another linux
machine on my local network gets very sluggish. This is in only one
direction a telnet in the other direction works fine and rebooting the
target machine has no effect while rebooting the machine in question fixes
the problem. Also while the telnets are sluggish, ftp does not seem
too bad --- ftp reports 850Kbytes per second for 12Mb transfer. Rlogin 
is just as slow as telnets.
  Any suggestions?
