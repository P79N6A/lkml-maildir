I personally prefer 'video=matrox:vesa:0x105' over 
'video=matrox:1024x768-8', as with matroxfb you can modify this mode with
'left', 'right', 'fv', 'fh'... options, and without these parameters it is 
unusable on fixed sync monitors (f.e. 'sync' is vital to specify 
sync-on-green feature).
If someone will create modedb, which will allow specifying all parameters
of fb_var_screeninfo, I'll remove this parsing code from matroxfb. But 
without it I think that 'vesa' will survive forever... And as I can test
only vga16fb and matroxfb, I'm not probably right one to do this.
                                            Best regards,
                                                    Petr Vandrovec
