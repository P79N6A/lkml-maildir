I only used Alpha one time in my life for some hour so I don't know ;). I
guess it's because Alpha is (was) faster.

Really it seems to me that you have not changed it but you have simply
applyed it by hand ;).

I was worried about that infact (I also tried to fix that in the 2.1.x
cycle but somebody complained when I replaced the `if (->counter + 3 <
xxx->count) with `if (goodness(xxx) < goodness(xx))' telling me that the
current reschedule_idle() was just smart enough...).
I'll provide you a patch shortly to try out.

Yes: you are wasting time 39056 times/sec in the scheduler.
