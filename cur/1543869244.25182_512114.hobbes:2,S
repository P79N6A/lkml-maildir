I generally agree, with some comments.
If we come to the decision that there are some message rates that are  
better suited to delivery into a user-read ring (10gige rx to kevent,  
say) then it doesn't seem like it would be much of a stretch to add a  
facility where syslet completion could be funneled into that channel  
as well.
I also wonder if there isn't some opportunity to cut down the number  
of syscalls / op in networking land.  Is it madness to think of a  
call like recvmsgv() which could provide a vector of msghdrs?  It  
might not make sense, but it might cut down on the per-op overhead  
for loads that know they're going to be heavy enough to get a decent  
amount of batching without fatally harming latency.  Maybe those  
loads are rare..
