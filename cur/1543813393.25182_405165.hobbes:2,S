They are in the latest -mm tree if you wish to use them.  Unfortunatly
it might look like they will not work out, due to the per-cpu relay
files not working properly with Paul's patches at the moment.  But I
think he's still working on them.
What's wrong with debugfs?

Fair enough, you are correct.  There is a serious dearth of sysfs and
kobject documentation lately, I'll work on fixing that up.

Touche :)
I referred to my prior lkml post:
	
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/383717
which provides a structure for documenting the user<->kernel API, which
is what you are creating here.

I completly agree, anything that is in sysfs falls under this
requirement.  Sorry, but I think of directories and symlinks as files,
as I've been spelunking through the vfs layer too many times :)
