Well, it depends on how broken they are then.
These keyboards actually work, so it is not so much a case
of being broken, more a case of  "too cheap to follow the spec,
but we can still get the keypresses"? 
I should have been more clear.  With blacklisting, I didn't mean
to make the driver refuse them.  I was thinking about
http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Hardware-HOWTO/index.html
and similiar sites, where a buyer can go and look for any linux issues
with the hardware he plans to buy.  There is no problem if 50%
of all hardware ends up here - one can then read about the issues
and decide if they matter enough to get a different brand instead.
