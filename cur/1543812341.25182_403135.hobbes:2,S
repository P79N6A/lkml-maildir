Well, we could ask samsung to rename their range, but i doubt they will 
do so. Actually, there are a lot of these platforms already defined, eg 
s3c2410, s3c2440, s3c2400, etc..
But now that you mention it, i could have been more clear about this, 
stating that it was a Samsung ARM processor. Sorry about that, i don't 
think the issue is worth reposting the entire patchset or am i mistaken?
Best,
Koen
