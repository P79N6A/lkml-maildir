This makes sense to me, when combined with kprobes. I refer to the dtrace
Usenix 
http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/content/dtrace/dtrace_usenix.pdf.
 They
argue (Section 4.2 Statically-defined Tracing):
"While FBT (Function Boundary Tracing) allows for comprehensive probe
coverage, one must be familar with the kernel implementation to use it
effectively. To have probes with semantic meaning, one must allow probes to
be statically declared in the implementation. The mechanism for implemting
this is typically a macro that expands to a conditional call into a tracing
framework if tracing is enabled. While the probe effect of this mechanism is
small, it is observable: even when disabled, the expanded macro introduces a
load, a compare and a taken branch.
In keeping with our philosophy of zero probe effect when disabled, we have
implemnted a statically defined tracing (SDT) provider by defining a C macro
that expands to a call to a non-existent function with a well-defined prefix
("__dtrace_probe_"). When the kernel linker sees a relocation against a
function with this prefix, it replaces the call instruction with a
no-operation and records the full name of the bogus function along with the
location of the call site. Wehn the SDT provider loads, it queries the
auxiliary structure and creates a probe with a name specified by the
function name. When a SDT probe is enabled, teh no-operation at the call
site is patched to be a call into an SDT-controlled trampoline that
transfers control into DTrace."
