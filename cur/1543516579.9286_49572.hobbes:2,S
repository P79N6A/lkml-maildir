My question is somewhat network oriented. It appears that LINUX socket 
buffers sk_buff) contain the whole contiguous packet and there is no 
mechanism to represent a packet as a scatter / gather list. For ethernet 
(MTU=1500) this is not a problem, however, Fibre Channel devices specify an 
MTU of 65280 bytes. The major problem is posting buffers to the adapter for 
recieving packets. Under SOLARIS, for example, I can post 4k buffers to the 
adapter. The driver can then chain these 4k buffers together if the packet 
recieved is > 4K. With LINUX, however, I have to post 64K buffers to the 
adapter since there is no mechanism to chain sk_buffs together. Depending 
on the TCP/UDP application being run (like telnet / rlogin), this will be a 
huge waste of memory. Is there a way to somehow chain sk_buffs in present / 
future versions of LINUX?
Thanks much.
