Subject: kernel panic after installing new kernel

hi,
I am using Redhat linux 5.2 kernel version 2.0.36. I am using a
Buslogic FlashPoint LT scsi adapter with seagate disk of 2GB and
DEC disk of 1GB.Recently I downloaded
the kernel source code for version 2.3.6. I compiled the source code with
support for NCR53C8XX support even though I dont have an 53c8xx based
card. I copied my /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage to /boot. My
orginal kernel was vmlinuz-2.0.36. Then I labelled the old kernel as
linux1 and added an entry for my new kernel as image=/boot/bzImage and
labelled it as linux2. Then I ran /sbin/lilo. Also before modifying
lilo.conf, I made a backup of it.
I did a reboot and at lilo prompt I selected linux1 (my orginal 2.0.36
kernel). I got a kernel panic with following message:
scsi: 0 hosts
scsi: detected total
Partition check:
VFS: Cannot poen root device 08:22
Kernel panic: VFS: unable to mount root fs on 08:22
Then I did reboot and selected linux2 (my new 2.3.6 kernel). This went
thru fine except that it showed hundreds of nonexistent disks. Then I got
a error message
init: error in loading shared libraries: /lib/libNoVersion.so.1: failed to
map segment from shared object: Cannot allocate memory.
Then I booted thru my booted disk and went to rescue mode. At the prompt,
I did a
mount -t ext2 /dev/sdb1 /mnt
I got an error saying
mount : the kernel does not recognize /dev/sdb1 as a block device.
	(maybe 'insmod driver'?)
So my question is how do I mount my root file system so that I can restore
my lilo.conf and run lilo?
Also why is my orginal kernel failing? 
Please help.
Thanks in advance,
Raju
