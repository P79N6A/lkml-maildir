Miness 0x25, VP2/97 and pretty questionable.  Locks up after an hour or
two if I just enable DMA.  I found `hdparm -X34 -d1' lets me use DMA
without any hangs.  Speed is markedly improved with it.  Can't get UDMA
at all though.  Not a clue how.  BIOS doesn't support it but disk does.
I don't know if the recent chipset tuning stuff helps.  Haven't tried
removing the -X34 to find out.
