IMHO the best thing is to change the RELOC macro, so that gcc cannot optimize
this.
E.g.:
-#define PTRRELOC(x)     ((typeof(x))((unsigned long)(x) + offset))
+#define PTRRELOC(x)     ({ unsigned long __x = (unsigned long)(x);	\
			    asm ("" : "=r" (__x) : "0" (__x));		\
			    (typeof(x))(__x + offset); })
This way gcc cannot assume anything about it.
