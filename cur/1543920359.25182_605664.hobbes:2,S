Yes, it's all right here. Sorry for bothering - I should've found this
by myself.
I've still some doubts about this possible enable_irq() after
free_irq(). If it's the only handler the status would be changed again
and at least some of this code in check_irq_resend() would be run, but
I can miss something again or/and this doesn't matter, as well.
Thanks,
