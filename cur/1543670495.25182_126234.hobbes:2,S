Subject: [PATCH 2.5] report unknown NMI reasons only once

Hi people!
On my machine (Athlon XP on an old ALi Magik1 motherboard), I get tons of
messages like:
Uhhuh. NMI received for unknown reason 2d on CPU 0.
Dazed and confused, but trying to continue
Do you have a strange power saving mode enabled?
There's nothing I can do about them (ACPI or APIC support in the kernel or
not does not make a difference, nor do any of the BIOS power management
settings). The machine runs fine, no problems in memtest86, and I've not
noticed a problem with a system in the three or four months that I'm
running this configuration.
Those NMIs happen only rarely when the machine is lightly loaded, but
under load, I get several of them per second. This quickly makes
/var/log/messages grow.
I don't think reporting any of those NMIs more than once provides
valuable information, so I've cooked up a patch which only reports each
unknown NMI reason once.
I don't know who the maintainer of arch/i386/kernel/traps.c is supposed
to be, so I'm sending this to the list and CC to Alan since he is not
unlikely to take small patches like this. ;)
Patch against 2.5.67-bk10. Compiles, boots and does what it's supposed to
do on my machine.
Comments, anyone?
