Lets say @cpu = 4

Lets say we release the workqueue mutex here (events/4 is trying to
flush its own workqueue). Immediately another CPU takes this mutex 
(in CPU_DOWN_PREPARE) and brings down CPU4. In CPU_DEAD handling we now wait 
on events/4 thread to exit (cleanup_workqueue_thread).
Couldnt this wait deadlock on :

events/4 thread itself wanting the same mutex above?
What am I missing?
