But why do you want to do your own cache? Any individual fs driver is in no 
position to know the overall demands on the VMM of the currently running 
kernel/user programs/etc. As such it is IMHO inefficient and I think it 
won't actually work due to VMM requiring to free specific memory and hence 
calling writepage on that specific memory so it can throw the pages away 
afterwards but in your concept writepage won't result in the page being 
marked clean and the vm has made no progress and you have just created a 
hole load of headaches for the VMM which it can't solve...
The VMM should be the ONLY thing in the kernel that has full control of all 
caches in the system, and certainly all fs caches. Why you are putting a 
second cache layer underneath the VMM is beyond me. It would be much better 
to fix/expand the capabilities of the existing VMM which would have the 
benefit that all fs could benefit not just ReiserFS.

Yes it does make it the wrong name, but not only that it also breaks the 
existing VMM if I understand anything about the VMM (which may of course 
not be the case...).
Just a thought.
