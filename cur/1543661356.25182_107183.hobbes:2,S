The HomePNA protocol usually uses the exact same kind of wire at
10BASE-T. It's just wired differently. I don't think you have two
such connectors on your board.
This looks as though your wire is just connected backwards, i.e.,
you have a reversed patch-cord.
Are you connected to a Hub? Does the LED on the hub show that
the wire is connected properly an does the LED on/near the connector on
your PC show that its connected correctly also?
If you really do have to such connectors, just use eth1 instead of
eth0, i.e., `ifconfig eth1 ip-address ...`
