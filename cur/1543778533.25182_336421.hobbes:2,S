The "Badness in iosapic_unregister_intr at arch/ia64/kernel/iosapic.c:851"
messages are caused by a missing call to free_irq() in the mpt/fusion driver.
I think that it should go here ... but someone with a clue should verify:
diff --git a/drivers/message/fusion/mptbase.c b/drivers/message/fusion/mptbase.c
--- a/drivers/message/fusion/mptbase.c
+++ b/drivers/message/fusion/mptbase.c
@@ -1384,6 +1384,8 @@ mpt_suspend(struct pci_dev *pdev, pm_mes
 	/* Clear any lingering interrupt */
 	CHIPREG_WRITE32(&ioc->chip->IntStatus, 0);
 
+	free_irq(ioc->pci_irq, ioc);
+
 	pci_disable_device(pdev);
 	pci_set_power_state(pdev, device_state);
 
But even this doesn't fix the hang during shutdown :-(
The remaining problem is cause by the order of the calls in sys_reboot:
                device_suspend(PMSG_SUSPEND);
                device_shutdown();
The call to device_suspend() shuts down the mpt/fusion driver.  But then
device_shutdown() calls sd_shutdown() which prints:
  Synchronizing SCSI cache for disk sdb
and then calls sd_sync_cache().  Now since we suspended mpt/fusion, this is
going to go nowhere.
I don't know how to fix this.  Re-ordering the suspend & shutdown just looks
wrong.
