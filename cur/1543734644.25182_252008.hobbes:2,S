Your drive doesn't advertise FLUSH_CACHE support, the model for when we
use these commands changed between -rc1 and -rc2. This essentially means
that you have to turn off write back caching for safe operations on a
journalled drive.
Alan, I bet there are a lot of these. Maybe we should consider letting
the user manually flag support for FLUSH_CACHE, at least it is in their
hands then.
