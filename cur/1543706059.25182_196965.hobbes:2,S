We know about this bug. It's related to VRA detection which is failing for 
multichannel codecs in some cases. You may try to force your game to 
48000Hz/16-bit/stereo audio parameters until we can fix this bug - or look 
to Documentation/sound/alsa/OSS-Emulation.txt for hints to make quake 
working. Unfortunately no primary ALSA developer has access to this 
type of hardware so debugging is quite slow using e-mails.
