In theory? Maybe.
In practice, a lot more than just "tar and friends" assume that inodes
are unique...
mark (who recently, *continues* to write code that makes this assumption,
      although, granted, most of the checks are 'file caching'-type
      checks, and it isn't likely that a file will be the same size, the
      same inode, the same device, and the same path...)
