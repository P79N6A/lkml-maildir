To make it easy for everyone....
There should not be many AC users that run the latest versions of
everything.
I will keep the sorting of the syscalls as they are - no change required
upstream.
People who want new kernel or new glibc will then also need to update
the other. DOT. POINT. END. :-)
Kernel 2.6.23 will also require new aboot.... So many things....
Since online upgrading from AC3 to FC8axp will not be supported anyway
(because of various reasons and now 2 more of them), I can live with
that decision finally.
Thx everyone...
Best,
 Oliver
