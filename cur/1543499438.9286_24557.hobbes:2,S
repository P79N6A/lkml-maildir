    The namespace for /dev was dictated a long time ago, and you vary
    from that namespace at your own risk.   (I like to number console
    devices tty1...tty9, ttya...ttyf.   SVGATextMode, and X11 wants to
    number them tty1...tty15.  Thus symlink heaven.  Which feeds right
    into....)
    "But I don't like the devfs defaults!"
    Symlinks are your friend.   If you can't live without the dubious
    benefit of having the kernel not tell you information, but instead
    have to guess about what devices are, you can do this with symlinks.
    ``/dev/tty1 -> /devices/tty1'' is close to exactly the same as
    ``mknod /dev/tty1 c 4 1'', except for the error messages you get
    when you bobble the magic.   Where a devfs wins, and wins big, is
    that if you choose not to place your faith in black magic, you can
    actually open the device -- it's really hard to open block 4, minor
    1 by itself.

    No.  The kernel should be exporting the information so that a program
    can open devices with that information.  The traditionalist can always
    choose to poo-poo this approach and use the traditional stone axe to
    open devices with.
