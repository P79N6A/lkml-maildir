Each bus should come up with its own way to uniquely identify devices...
such is required for SCSI and EthTool ioctls which request bus
information (as a text string) for a given device.  PCI is simply the
one example I know well... pci_dev->slot_name.
Note, however, I have come to think that "tulip0: ...", "tulip1: ...",
etc. is more user-friendly than "00:f0.1: ...".

Are you talking about his 140k patch?
I think a key point of my patch is that drivers now follow the method of
other kernel drivers: perform all setup necessary, and then register the
device in a single operation.  After register_foo(dev), all members of
'dev' are assumed to be filled in and ready for use.  This is not the
case with init_etherdev() normal usage, nor using dev->init()...
Tangent - IMHO having register_netdev call dev->init is ugly and unusual
compared to other driver APIs in the kernel.  Your register function
should not call out to driver functions, it should just register a new,
already-set-up device in the subsystem and return.

So you say a fatal bug remains in 2.4.5-pre1?  If so please elaborate...

I dunno.  Andrew?  I just looked at all users and it looks like it can
be removed.
