Is this safe (as far as compressed LZO stream is concerned) --
or is it even needed (could it be unsigned int)?

On i386, both cpu_to_le16 and le16_to_cpu do nothing.
On sparc for example, cpu_to_leXX and leXX_to_cpu do 'the same' ;-)
they swap 1234<->4321.
It is the bytestream (ip) that is reinterpreted as uint16_t.
And I really doubt that the LZO author has a big-endian machine,
given the days of ubiquitous x86. le16_to_cpu it is.
