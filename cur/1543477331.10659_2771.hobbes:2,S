	Looks like we already have it. Depending on what you mean, that
is. If you are concerned about number of nested symlinks (traversed
without eating new components of name) - it's 5. There is only one place
where it is checked - see fs/namei.c::do_follow_links() for details. Limit
is mostly due to our implementation of lookups. Linux doesn't use
nameidata and thus symlink lookups are recursive. Kernel stack is
limited... If you are after *total* number of symlinks traversed during
a lookup - no such limit. IIRC, 4.4BSD doesn't limit it too (well, aside
of the limitations on path length). It *does* use nameidata, so the limit
is larger than our.
