the api stabilization should have been happening months ago, in view of

certainly, and sometimes i wonder if there could be a better way (than
#error or #warning) to tag things as known broken.  currently people use
#error during compile, but i'd like to see it show up in menuconfig
somehow.
been thinking about it, but i haven't thought of a palatable solution
yet.  keeping the tag in the source files (as it is now) is probably a
good idea, but is suboptimal for external tools.  menuconfig doesn't
want to know about the actual source files
