Hi Keith,
here is a feature request for insmod:
When I try to load a module and the same module already exists in kernel,
this will be detected and the module won't be loaded twice. Fine.
However, if you try to load a module and the same code is compiled
statically into the kernel, you're out of luck. This typically happens with
distributions, that provide several kernels but just one set of modules, BTW.
For most of the modules, we are lucky, they register a blockdevice or a
hardware ressource and fail, so module initialization fails. However, this
is not safe. scsi_mod, e.g. does not have such a protection. (Before you
try: Prepare for rebooting, afterwards.)
I'd like insmod to detect this. As it read the symbol table of the running
kernel anyway, it could check for symbols being defined and exported from
both the kernel and module being loaded. If there are, let insmod fail.
(And provide an option to override it, either with -f or with a new one.)
Comments?
