And a change of vanilla kernel version leading to breakage is not a 
sufficient condition to conclude the kernel's at fault. The entire history 
of computing is saturated with examples of coders doing stupid things with 
foolish assumptions and incidental interfaces of operating systems (early 
games on *-DOS being a prime example) that are subsequently broken by new 
versions of the operating system. That's programs being stupid, not the 
operating system.
