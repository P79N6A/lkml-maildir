Not so, CAP_SYS_ADMIN is required.  Depending on your tree, check
kernel/utsname.c or kernel/nsproxy.c.
Mind you, whether there is a reason to require CAP_SYS_ADMIN for utsname
I'm not sure.  But if there is any way of finding privileged software
which would behave differently based on utsname information, then we
should.

There is no way we can think about doing that until we determine that
every kernel will have the ns container subsystem compiled in and
mounted, right?
