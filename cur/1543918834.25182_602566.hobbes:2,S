Subject: hdparm standby timeout not working for WD raptors?

I can't get "hdparm -S" to work at all.
Using  "hdparm -S 1" should set the timeout to
5 seconds,  but the drives stay active/idle all the
time. When I set to standby manually, the drives
stay on standby for days, and start up fine when
they are used. I know this because I logged status
every 30 minutes using crontab.
They just don't standby automatically.
I'm using 5 identical drives (see below for drive
info), with software RAID.
Any suggestions? System details follow.
