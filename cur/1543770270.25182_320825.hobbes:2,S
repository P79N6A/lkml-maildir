In order to keep the legacy world from falling to bits IDE and VGA have
some ugly hacks in the PCI spec.
In legacy mode an IDE device appears at the "old" standard IDE addresses
and uses an external IRQ pin wired to the ISA IRQ lines (14 or 15). In
native mode it behaves like a PCI device, honouring the PCI bars and
using the PCI INT lines.

and from a wiring perspective its often decided irrevocably by the board
maker.
