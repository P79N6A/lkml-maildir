If that kernel thread is sleeping because it waits for disk, it has
some state, and I do not want to freeze it just now (because it might
hold some lock). I only want to freeze them at safe point, and it
seemed to me that for kernel threads it is easiest to mark safe points
by hand.
Does it compile for you for now?
