Hi,
   I'm having a litte trouble with >=2.2.5 kernels, AIC-7xxx driver and
my Sony CD-R model CDU-926S revision 1.1e. Since I upgraded to 2.2.5 and
up, the only way I can boot is disabling Disconnect/Reconnect for the
CD-R, in Adaptec's SCSI bios (I have one AHA-2940 and one AHA-2940UW,
the CD-R is connected in AHA-2940, scsi ID 6).
   If I boot with disconnect/reconnect enabled, with kernel >=2.2.5 (the
first I tested, tried with 2.2.5, 2.2.6, 2.2.7, 2.2.8, 2.2.9 and
2.2.10), then the following messages occur:
(scsi1:0:6:0) No active SCB for reconnecting target. Issuing
BUS_DEVICE_RESET.
(scsi1:0:6:0)   SAVED_TCL=0x60, ARG_1=0xff, SEQADDR=0xfc.
   When I tried to burn a CD with kernel 2.2.10 with
Disconnect/Reconnect disabled, I noticed that the activity led of the
SCSI board always on, the buffer of cdrecord runs out, and I got an
underrun.. :(
   To track down the problem, I booted an old 2.0.36 kernel, and, with
the same setup (disconnect/reconnect disabled), I got the same problem
(this way, I was using dummy writes - didn't want to lost another
media). Then, I enabled disconnect/reconnect for the CD-R, in bios, and
the problem got away.
   One time, I tried to copy the 2.0.36 aic7xxx driver (aic7xxx*.[ch]
and aic7xxx directory) to a fresh 2.2.5 kernel, and I got the same
results.
   There is anything I can do to start to find the problem?
   TIA,
	Robson
