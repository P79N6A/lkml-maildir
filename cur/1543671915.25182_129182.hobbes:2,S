Here are some results with the scrambling function on AMD K6-III 450MHz, 
gcc-2.95.3:
fls_old (generic_fls from linux 2.5.68):
real    3m52.960s
user    3m42.080s
sys     0m0.348s
fls_bsrl:
real    4m39.040s
user    4m25.532s
sys     0m0.401s
fls_table:
real    4m59.622s
user    4m45.511s
sys     0m0.469s
fls_tree:
real    3m3.986s
user    2m55.236s
sys     0m0.272s
fls_shift:
real    2m58.765s
user    2m50.092s
sys     0m0.278s
So for me the table version seems to be the slowest one. The BSRL instruction 
on the K6-III seems to be very slow, too. The tree and my shift version are 
faster than the original version here...
That someone else can test my fls_shift version I'll provide it here again:
static inline int fls_shift(int x)
{
	int bit = 32;
 
	while(x > 0) {
		--bit;
		x <<= 1;
	}
	return x ? bit : 0;
}
