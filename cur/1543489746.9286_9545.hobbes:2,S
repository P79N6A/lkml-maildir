The help text is confusing yes. The actual rules are
You can have one or the other compiled in not both.
You can have both in the module case - and the question need not be asked
except as a choice for a default. Right now the driver doesnt exclude code.
Its settable as a module option.
Its possible to have both forms loaded as a module at the same time.
So yes I guess a choice comes out right if you rephrase it slightly for
modules. And yes the help text is misleading.
