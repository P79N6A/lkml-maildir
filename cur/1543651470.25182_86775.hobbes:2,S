ptrace predates /proc, and /proc is gradually superseding ptrace.
Eventually it is hoped that ptrace dies.
Other architecture's added performance counters back in 2.4 before sysfs
was added.
The reason to use a file system rather than a syscall is so that
standard tools like sh, awk, perl, ... can be used on the data without
having to build a separate command to access the data.
Linus is more likely to adopt simpler logical interfaces.
