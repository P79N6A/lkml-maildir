No, but it will work as if it does...explain below.
You have 2 processor packages, each one is HyperThreading capable. This
means you have two 'CPUs' inside each package, so that sums up your 4 CPUs.
But there is a flaw. The 2 'CPUs' inside each processor package are not
full real CPUs, just two register sets that share cache, FP units, integer
units and so on. So let's say your Xeon has 8 FP units, and you want to
run a FPU intensive task with low or null disk IO. If you activate
hyperthreading each of the 2 'cpus' has 4 FP units, so half the computation
power. If you deactivate HT, you have 1 CPU with 8 FP units.
In short, for FP intensive tasks, hyperthreading is a big lie...
You can't run 2 computations in parallel.
