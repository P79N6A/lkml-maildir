What kind of an argument is this? What difference can you see between a
transient loop and a permanent loop for the applications? Exactly zero I guess.
In my environments nil boots ought to happen. 
This is the reason why I would in fact be satisfied with mount -bind if only I
could export it via nfs...

Or marking the links as type links somehow.

There should be no difference if only a hardlink is simply marked as such by
any kind of marker you possibly can think of.
