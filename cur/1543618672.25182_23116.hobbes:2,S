Oh, that changes it, I should have looked closer.
I am not sure the "1200 NFS mounts" case warrants the
change though, so far we have only one active user (Rainer) :)
If ISPs and universities clamour for my patch, then sure,
we may improve it with devfs_alloc_major() in 2.4, too.
Otherwise, whatever... Thanks for the explanation, Richard,
I'll keep it in my notes.
