Hmm, lspci must show the string like 'VIA86C686A' or 'VIA8235' ('VIA'
can be 'VT').

You can use alsaconf script.  It will detect the right module.

That's true.  The sure way would be to retrieve the pci id table from
the source code...

Then you might need to give the correct port number and the irq
number as module parameters.  Perhaps you can get them from BIOS.

I guess you see a kernel message when you load snd-via8xx driver
regarding dxs_support option (suppose that your chip is VIA823x)?
In worst case, you can eliminate the  noises with dxs_support=2
option.

Sorry, no, the chipset on many mobos is so buggy :)
That's why we need so many workarounds.
OSS driver has no problem regarding clicking noises because it doesn't
support the DXS channels, the multiple playback.  ALSA supports it as
default.  dxs_support=2 options disables it.
See ALSA-Configuration.txt for details.
Anyway, OSS VIA driver also doesn't support MIDI for VIA823x.
It's for VIA686 only, as well as on ALSA driver.
