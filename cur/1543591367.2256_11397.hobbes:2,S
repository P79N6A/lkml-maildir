Is this a real card, or is it built-in on the motherboard?
I don't think eepro100 has got much testing with rev > 9, though it should
have worked. All eepro100 chips are supposed to be backwards compatible with
the 82557, but maybe our driver initializes some registers in a way that
upsets newer chips. Not having docs for the newer chips doesn't help, either...
Intel's own e100 driver probably works, their code does things differently if
rev >= 12 (what they call the D102 revision). Give it a spin, I guess.
