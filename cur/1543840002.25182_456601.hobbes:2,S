I am writing a test hypervisor interface in a module, so this is a
feature not a bug.
We can certainly move it to some read-protected page, but then the
module will simply unprotect it and alter it.
Now, discarding the patching information makes life harder, but you can
simply scan the text segments to find them again, or just trap when they
happen and patch dynamically (but this won't work for pushf and popf, if
you care about them).
I realize that the virtualizing-root-kit is a sexy idea, I'm just not
sure that paravirt_ops an effective place to be looking for a solution.
Rusty.
