It doesn't blow up straight away, but more chances that on the next make
will be sig11.

Not only the old disk was on the same computer, but I worked until now
on
2.0.29 flawlessly but in slow speed of the disk

I'm not forcing DMA with hdparm and I don't know how to do it, but as
you said here
I indeed found option in 2.2.1 to turn off DMA ( but not UDMA ; What
mode
is it working
now anyway :)) I turned it off, compiled the kernel 80 times with no
problems.

Outputs of hdparm running 2.2.1 are attached.
The question being raised is How is it possible that this is a known
model,
known manufacturer, the disk is ok - EXCEPT the DMA thing. 
And from here- Is buying the same thing safe or with change of size 
from 5.1GB to 6GB or with QUANTUM --> WD, and generally - is there a way 
to prove the disk being bad with some win95 ( i hate to say this word)
program.
> Oh, what motherboard do you have? (VIA?)
My configuration is:
P2 266 + 64MB + 5.1 Quantum
Motherboard: SP-P2LXC ( i don't have the company name).
As I thinking now It may be problem with the Motherboard controller,
so I don't know what to do, help please I can't goon with speed anymore,
(and the `funny` thing I suspect in not a hardware problem.)

by the way - I have this distortion of the screen every time I logining
one of consoles
or starting mc for example - minor problem but annoying. -- what can be
done ? --
Thanks for your help,
Pavel.
