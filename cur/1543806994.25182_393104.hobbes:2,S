TCP/IP is a pain because it has so many global static variables, but otherwise
it is easier than PIDs.  You just need what looks like 2 instances
of the network stack.   And since you usually don't have enough real
hardware a 2 headed network device that acts like 2 NICS plugged into
a cross over cable.

Exactly.

I always look at migration in terms of a container/VPS.
However the entire system can be considered one such container.  So on the
extreme side you can migrate everything to another machine.  It's not
a hard requirement but it would be nice if the mechanism wasn't so special
that it prevented that.

Not exactly insecure.   But something you need to be careful with.
It's an idea I don't like personally.  But I like it more than adhoc
mechanisms for modify what I guest gets to look at.

I was talking about sysadmin style of debugging.

This is something I will freely admit is up on the air, how this
should be accomplished.  But I don't want an assumption that the host
system will always be able to access guest resources.
