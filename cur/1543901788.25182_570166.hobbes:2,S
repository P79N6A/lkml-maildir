I can certainly keep the revert around in my trees. (although it's a 
complication, i have to take care for it to never leak out into any 
external trees, etc. - but it's not a big issue)
Fundamentally, i trust Olaf to fix this quickly, and i dont want to make 
a too big fuss about this, but in general it's always better to revert 
patches causing known regressions (unless the revert is hugely complex 
and other changes depend on it - but this isnt the case here). I can 
also run whatever test-patches of Olaf, that would instrument/dump 
whatever info is needed to fix this. So Olaf's debugging effort is not 
hindered in any way as far as i can see.
I think if you leaned back and thought it through, and if you applied 
this scenario to a bad scheduler commit from me that broke your box, 
you'd readily agree with me =B-) (which scenario is purely hypothetical, 
my scheduler commits are all 100% perfect of course ;-)
