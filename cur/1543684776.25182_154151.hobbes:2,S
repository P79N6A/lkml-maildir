I couldn't tell from your posting if you were arguing for an offload or not.
If you are, and you are using these stats as a reason, I'd like to know 
the absolute numbers, router to router, that we are talking about.  I have
a feeling that few cheap PC's could handle all the load but I'm willing 
to be educated.
Even if I'm way off, a pair of routers between Australia and the US is 
hardly a reason to muck about in the TCP stack.  If we were talking 
about millions of routers, well sure, that makes sense.
