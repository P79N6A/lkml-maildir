OK, will test.
I know the Ingo's raid patch hasn't been included because of tool
compatibility problems.  Has anyone thought of having both versions in the
2.2 kernel?  Would this be trivial, or something that would change too much
for 2.2?
I've been compiling in Andre's EIDE patch for months, without any problems
on x86.  Except for an #include error on PPC.  I have a patch, but I can't
sent attach now because the patch is on a computer that is off at the moment...
Is there any chance of getting either of these two things into 2.2.21?
Mike
