I think there is some confusion in the name "Celeron". AFAIK there are
two kinds of Celerons: the original PII based Celeron, or the newer
PIII based Celeron. My laptop has a PIII (Coppermine) based Celeron,
and it boots perfectly well without your patch. 
If you are using a PII based Celeron, you should compile the kernel
with support for the "Pentium-Pro/Celeron/Pentium-II". You certainly
should not try to run a kernel with support for P4 on a "lower" CPU,
read the documentation about CONFIG_M386 in Documentation/Configure.help
for more information.
