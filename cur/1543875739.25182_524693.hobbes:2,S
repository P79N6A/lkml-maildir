But would it not bias application writers towards using read()/write()
calls over mmap()? They know that their calls are likely to be faster
when the application is run in a container. Without page cache control
we'll end up creating an asymmetrical container, where certain usage is 
charged and some usage is not.
Also, please note that when a page is unmapped and moved to swap cache;
the swap cache uses the page cache. Without page cache control, we could
end up with too many pages moving over to the swap cache and still
occupying memory, while the original intension was to avoid this
scenario.
