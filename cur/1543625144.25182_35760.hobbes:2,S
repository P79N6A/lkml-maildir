Yech... Nobody should be seriously considering using unfsd: it does
not even manage to follow the NFS protocol. That inability was one of
the many reasons why Olaf Kirch abandoned further develpement of unfsd
and started work on knfsd.

So that is another argument for using knfsd rather than unfsd. I will
agree with you that NFS is not perfect, but please judge it on its
actual merits and not on some trumped up charge...
