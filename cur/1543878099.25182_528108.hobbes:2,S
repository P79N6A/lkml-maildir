If I'm understanding correctly, this will cause
# echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/online
to sometimes fail, and userspace is expected to try again?  This will
break existing applications.
Perhaps drivers/base/cpu.c:store_online should retry as long as
cpu_up/down return -EBUSY.  That would avoid a userspace-visible
interface change.
