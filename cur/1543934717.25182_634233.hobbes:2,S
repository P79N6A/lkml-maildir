Sure you can add some layers of wrappers and then have
"nv_store_mac(np->orig_mac)" instead. Congratulations, you saved 2 lines
and added 6 new ones (assuming that you don't go universally u8, that
adds even more). This is the only place that writes the MAC address
besides the existing nv_copy_mac_to_hw wrapper which deals with
net_devices and thus is perfectly usable, internally and externally.

A function to read the MAC address from the hardware? There's only a
single place (nv_probe()) that ever reads it, why bother?

Hu? The MAC address is only ever reversed when the card is not in use,
why the hell would you want to reverse anything when the rest of the OS
is involved? This whole reversing stuff is purely before and after the
card is actually used. It's not that you need to reverse the address to
communicate with the card, it's just initially wrong on the card.

At probing time, you'll have to know whether the address you read from
the hardware is reversed or not. Unless you write it back in reversed
order when you release the card, you need a flag that at least survives
until nv_probe is called the next time. kexec does not write it back, so
you do need such a flag. But the flag apparently doesn't survive a
suspend/resume cycle, so you need to write back the reversed address
then. But the flag will survive a rmmod + modprobe cycle, so you need to
reset it when writing back the reversed address.

Well, let's see if my analysis was correct and the patch works, first. I
saw the forcedeth code before, but kexec and suspend is totally new to
me and I just made some assumptions based on the reported behaviour and
the commit messages... ;-)
