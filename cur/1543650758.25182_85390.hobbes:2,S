Except almost all hardware out there that does this stuff is async to
some extent...
I'm just speaking as someone who has (sadly) done this a couple of
times already for commercial real-world products.  I'm no expert, I
don't claim to be and admit there is still plenty to learn...
... that said, having access to lots of hardware, both our own and
other peoples, almost all of it needs to be driven asynchronously to
get good performance (or by a large number of threads).
