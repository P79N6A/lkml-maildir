what you _STILL_ do not realize is the following: you still attribute 
the lack of Cc:s to some intention of mine. No, it was not my intention. 
At first glance the Cc: looked large and complete enough in an 
_existing_ discussion and that's was the end of my (brief) attention 
regarding the Cc: line. Yes, it would have been a bit better had i 
noticed the lack of Cc:s in an existing discussion, but i didnt.
[ And it might not surprise you if i observe here that i think this
  little mishap is further (incidental) proof that having this many
  mailing list aliases to get the 'guaranteed attention' of maintainers 
  is just super fragile and does not serve users at all. Even Greg and i 
  got it wrong accidentally. If _we_ get it wrong, who will get it 
  right? I see several mis-Cc:ed emails every day and there's over a 
  1000 unfixed bugs in bugzilla for 2.6 alone. It does not take a genius 
  to observe that something is fundamentally wrong ;-) That 2.6 works on
  your or my box is a _very_ poor metric - we both fix bugs on our 
  systems super fast so we've got a very biased first-hand experience 
  about the stability and reliability of the kernel. We never really 
  feel the kind of frustration that testers feel when their mail to lkml 
  gets ignored. We never really feel the helplessness that comes from 
  unfixed bugs. ]
