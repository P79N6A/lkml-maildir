A sane cleanup, but it conflicts with vmscan-notice-slab-shrinking.patch,
which returns a different thing from shrink_slab() in order to account for
slab reclaim only causing internal fragmentation and not actually freeing
pages yet.
vmscan-notice-slab-shrinking.patch isn't quite complete yet, but we do need
to do something along these lines.  I need to get back onto it.
