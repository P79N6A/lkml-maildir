Yes, there is:
1) you don't really watch mainline development.
2) you are not trying to improve mainline suspend, all you want is to
merge suspend2.
3) you ask me to trust you to clean it up after merge.
4) you still have code that was declared unacceptable 12 months
ago. ("press C to continue..." from kernel!)
5) you refuse to use existing mainline features, even through bugs
that forced you to reimplement them were fixed _long_ time ago.
6) you spread FUD about swsusp. (I.e. latest attempt to redefine
"working").
