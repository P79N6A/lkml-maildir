A machine at a customer's site (running kernel 2.4.21) has stopped
answering over Ethernet today.  The machine itself was still there and
the customer could log in at the console.  A reboot fixed the problem.
The machine has had these error messages in the syslog about once per
hour for about 24 hours:
Mar  9 16:17:38 mail2 kernel: tg3: eth0: transmit timed out, resetting
Mar  9 16:17:38 mail2 kernel: tg3: tg3_stop_block timed out, ofs=3400 enable_bit=2
Mar  9 16:17:39 mail2 kernel: tg3: tg3_stop_block timed out, ofs=2400 enable_bit=2
Mar  9 16:17:39 mail2 kernel: tg3: tg3_stop_block timed out, ofs=1400 enable_bit=2
Mar  9 16:17:39 mail2 kernel: tg3: tg3_stop_block timed out, ofs=c00 enable_bit=2
The hardware is on-board on an IBM eServer pizza box, a dual broadcom
gigabit ethernet NIC.  Any ideas what might have caused this and what we
should do to prevent this from happening again?
Thanks,
Felix
