I'm dealing with a custom BRIDGE_OTHER chip, which has PCI devices
on the other side...the configuration cycles don't follow a standard, and
I'm trying to establish the bus behind the bridge when I install a module...
essentially I'm doing things similar to hotplug drivers...
I have no experience with hotplug drivers, but it appears to be incompatible
with the ppc architure...
Calling pci_do_scan_bus, it calls pcibios_fixup_bus.
In the 2.4 ppc kernels, pcibios_fixup_bus is defined to be:
void __init pcibios_fixup_bus(struct pci_bus *bus)
On intel, its defined to be:
void __devinit  pcibios_fixup_bus(struct pci_bus *bus)
Since pci_do_scan_bus needs CONFIG_HOTPLUG, this path is exercised,
and pcibios_fixup_bus isn't present on ppc after bootup...
This patch is necessary if we CONFIG_HOTPLUG on ppc...there seems
to be no reason why not -- others changes like this might be necessary...

The patch is wrt to 2.4.20, but 2.4.30 appears to have the same problem...
