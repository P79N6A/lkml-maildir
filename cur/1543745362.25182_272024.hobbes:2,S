Your version works fine (irdadump works).

I have a machine with nsc-ircc here so I think I'll try that too.

pnp_activate_dev() should probably be used to enable the device but it was
only used by ISAPNP drivers so I didn't use it in this patch.
I must admit that I really don't know much about the PNP subsystem. I 
used the parport_pc driver as a guide. I've CC'd Adam Belay and 
linux-kernel in the hopes that someone can help with this stuff.
