OK, I think so ... I just think making the generic arch the default is
sufficient, without hiding things away under another menu where it's
harder to find ... if people don't understand the question, they should
just take the default. Frigging with the wording might help a bit ...
I think there's some way to force a hint to appear automatically like 
"if you don't know, use XXX".
