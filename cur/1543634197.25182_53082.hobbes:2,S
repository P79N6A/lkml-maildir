	Why not? They're both at the same priority. They're both always 
ready-to-run. Neither blocks. Why should the kernel assume that one will do 
useful work while the other won't?

	And consider me immediately ready to run again.

	All the tasks are equally situated. Same priority, all ready-to-run.

	Because a thread/process that voluntarily yields its timeslice should be 
rewarded over one that burns it up, not penalized.

	So you're saying that the yielding tasks should be penalized for yielding 
rather than just being descheduled?

	I'm saying that the fixed behavior is better than the previous behavior and 
that the previous behavior wasn't particularly good. But I'm also saying that 
people are misusing sched_yield and have incorrect expectations about it.
	If you spin on sched_yield, expect CPU wastage. It's really that simple. 
Threads/processes that use sched_yield intelligently should be rewarded for 
doing so, not penalized. Otherwise sched_yield becomes much less useful.
