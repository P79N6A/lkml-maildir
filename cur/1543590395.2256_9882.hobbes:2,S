  Agreed, but some allocations of non-zero orders can fall back to other
schemes (such as an emergency buffer, or using vmalloc for a temp
buffer) and don't want to be trapped in __alloc_pages() for too long.
  Could introduce another allocation flag (__GFP_FAIL?) which is or'ed
with a __GFP_WAIT to limit the looping?

  Yes, it is possible to trap when kswapd might not make any useful
progress for a failing non-zero ordered allocation, and to set a global
"force" flag (kswapd_force) to ensure it does something useful.
  For order-1 allocations, that would work.
  For order-2 (and above) it becomes much more difficult as the page
'reap' routines release/process pages based upon age and do not factor in
whether a page may/will buddy (now or in the near future).  This 'blind'
processing of pages can wipe a significant percentage of the page cache
when trying to build a buddy at a high order.
  Of course, no one should be doing really large order allocations and
expecting them to succeed.  But, if they are doing this, the allocation
should at least fail.
