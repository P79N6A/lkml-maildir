Why is the TSC preferred to the HPET as a clocksource for the x86 
architecture?
"Understanding the Linux Kernel" states that the HPET is preferable to 
the TSC due to its richer architecture. Up to version 2.6.17.14, 
arch/i386/kernel/timers/timer.c also contained a comment to that effect 
and accordingly ranked the HPET before the TSC.
This was changed when the new clocksource infrastructure was introduced 
with version 2.6.18. (The HPET clocksource received a rating of 250; the 
TSC, 300.)
Preferring the TSC leads to problems when it is unstable. While this can 
be prevented by setting CONFIG_X86_TSC, certain distribution kernels 
(striving for compatibility) don't, resulting in soft lockups.
Are there better reasons to prefer the TSC or may I submit a patch that 
swaps the respective ratings?
Thanks for reading,
