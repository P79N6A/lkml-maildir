No, but USB HID devices (mouse, keyboard, ...) always implies HID.

In 2.4.x, the transition from "old-style" input drivers to new-style
(Input API) was never finished. Instead, Input API was introduced, and
HID devices reported their input to Input API, while old drivers still
used all their old ways to deliver their input.
This is why a keyboard still works without CONFIG_INPUT in 2.4.x, but it
won't any longer work in 2.6.x, because the old path for submitting
input was thrown away.

2.4.x:
	- USB keyboards/mice/... are "HID" devices, using the USB HID
	  protocol, delivering their data to the Input APU
	  (CONFIG_INPUT).
	- Legacy drivers (PS/2 keyboard and the like) had their own data
	  path and directly put their input into the virtual console
	  subsystem.
2.6.x:
	- USB keyboards/mice/... are "HID" devices, using the USB HID
	  protocol, delivering their data to the Input APU
	  (CONFIG_INPUT).
	- All legacy drivers are converted to also use the new Input API
	  subsystem; direct delivery of input was removed from the code
	  base.
So in 2.4.x, you've got two APIs for drivers to dispatch their input
(new drivers using the USB HID protocol already stuff their data into
Input API, old drivers still each use a direct way). In 2.6.x, the
direct ways were thrown away, and only the Input API is remaining.
