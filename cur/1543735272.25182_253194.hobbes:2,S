The point I was making is that this doesn't scale well, because it eats
resources which may be unavailable on many systems, and which others are
trying to conserve. Since this may limit the use it presents a problem
with usefulness.

I didn't intend this as a flame, but I do feel this implementation doesn't
scale. I offered another approach off the top of my head, which appears to
me to be more scalable. I claimed no expertise, I just made a suggestion,
based on my first thought on how I would attack the problem in a way which
appears more scalable.
If we are going to 4k stack because larger memory blocks are hard to find,
I have to suspect that anything which locks up blocks size in MB is going
to cause problems. I didn't even ask what would happen on NUMA machines,
because that's not my usual concern.
I'm still horified by the memory requirements :-(

Thanks for taking the time to note that my tone may have been harsh even
if my point was valid.
