missed options for optimizing for the specific CPU you have. it's not as 
bad as it used to be when everything was compiled for 386, but it's still 
a significant benifit to recompile with no changes in options except for 
the CPU type.
I haven't measured it recently, but in the 2.4.17/2.6.0 timeframe I was 
seeing >30% for optimized kernels vs stock ones so I don't think the 20% 
figure is unreasonable.
