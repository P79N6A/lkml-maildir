Subject: [RFC][PATCH] make all non-file-backed madvise() calls fail
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/4/1/202

This is related to this bug:
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2995
The kernel currently only checks that the memory is file-backed if
MADV_WILLNEED is set.  It's not entirely clear from the manpage at least
that *all* non-file-backed madvise() calls should fail.  
The attached patch returns -EBADF for all non-file-backed madvise()
calls.  I'm not suggesting that this is the absolutely right behavior,
but it certainly does what the bug submitter wants.
Comments?
