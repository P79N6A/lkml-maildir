You hit the nail on the head. I had previously measured with X shut down,
but the effect didn't disappear.
With init=/bin/bash, recvfrom suddenly takes from 900nsec to 1.3usec, with
only slight correlation between inter-call delay and cycles spent.
I'm investigating this further as it appears this has a real life effect on
my P4 - a drastic one!
