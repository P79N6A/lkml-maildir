Many of the people who use request_irq out of spinlocks are actually the
buggy ones, especially in the PCI world. Im not sure passing the
argument is the real fix. I'd like to be able to write code that was
more of the form
		irqptr = allocate_irq(irqnum, flags, handler, &err);
		install_irq(irqptr);
That would clean up vast amounts of locking, if I can allocate, check I
can obtain and handle all the setup -before- I turn the IRQ one.
enable/disable_irq doesnt really cut it for granularity and has the same
can't sleep issue
