I didn't set any environment variables when I manually recreated the
error, other then the default for root.
Maybe I will try setting TEMP=/tmp, but I doubt this would help, as the
problem seems to be in the kernel. I suspect the kernel puts the temp
file in the same directory as the "open" and "deleted" file (ie the fact
this case involves /tmp is a coincidence), probably to ensure that it
remains in the same partition (is this required?). I have not idea how
this problem should be addressed...
