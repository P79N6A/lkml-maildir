of course, for the record you can also find it in the ftp area all
splitted out, but I've no problem to send it via email too.
Quite frankly the BDEV_* handling was and is a total mess IMHO, even if
it was written by you ;), there was no difference at all from many of
them, I didn't fixed that but I had to check all them on the differences
until I realized there was none. I also think the other things you
mentioned (besides the inode pinning bug, non critical) are not buggy
(infact I never had a single report), but well we'll verify that in
detail ASAP.
