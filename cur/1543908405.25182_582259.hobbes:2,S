Asciidoc should preserve ascii-art diagrams OK; the git docs use them
all over.
Not that I'd necessarily push asciidoc.  But:

... at the point where you actually start setting standards for subtitle
underlining and list enumeration, you'd want to take another look at
asciidoc; since it already defines conventions for that stuff (which
are probably close to what people would do anyway), it might make sense
just to start using asciidoc.
