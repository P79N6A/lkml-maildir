Hi,
  is timeout field in i2c_algo_bit_data supposed to be in jiffies
(like it is currently used) or in 10ms units? If it is supposed
to be in jiffies (other algos do not care about timeout field),
there is dozen of places (all callers of i2c_bit_add_bus) which
get it wrong.
  Next suspicious thing is that 'timeout' field from i2c_adapter
structure is not used at all - only i2c_control is willing to
set it, but nobody reads this field. Should not i2c_bit_add_bus
copy its timeout into this field, and then use adap->timeout instead
of bitadap->timeout in its sclhi() procedure?
                                        Thanks,
                                                Petr Vandrovec
