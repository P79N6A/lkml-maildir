Folks,
when I took a 15-minute look at this code last week I found several
bugs, some of which were grave.  It's a terrible thing to say, but
a sensible person would expect that a closer inspection would turn
up more problems.
Now, adding bugs to existing code is fine and traditional - people
find them quickly and they get fixed up.
But for *new* code, problems will take months to discover.  The only
practical way to get this code vetted for inclusion is a close review.
And that is a sizeable task.  The core implementation file is
1,600 lines.  And I wonder how many people have counted the
number of comments in there?
Well, I'll make it easy: zero.  Nil.  Nada.
(Well, OK, a copyright header, and something which got cut-n-pasted
from inode.c)
In my wildly unconventional opinion this alone makes epoll just a hack,
of insufficient quality for inclusion in Linux.  We *have* to stop doing
this to ourselves!
epoll seems to be a good and desirable thing.  To move forward I
believe we need to get this code reviewed, and documented.
I can do that if you like; it will take me several weeks to get onto
it.  But until that is completed I would oppose inclusion of this
code.
