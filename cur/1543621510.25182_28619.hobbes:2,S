New FAQ entry:
* Inventing CML2 was unnecessary, since CML1 carries enough information to
  do consistency checking and side-effect forcing.

Jeff and Alan have put their finger neatly on one of the key bits CML2
can do that CML1 cannot -- express cross-directory dependencies in
such a way that the configurator can force side effects in both
directions.  This is, in fact, the very rock on which my original
attempt to save CML1 foundered after six weeks of effort.
