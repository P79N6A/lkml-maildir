Well, I don't think so, but I'm not sure.
The VGA/fb console also should be off during suspend (not necessarily during
hibernation, though).  IIRC, that's what caused Linus to introduce the
suspending of consoles after all.

I'm not sure which way to go.  On the one hand, I agree that we should rather
fix the consoles so that we know which one is suspend-safe and which is not
and disable the unsafe ones, but on the other hand we are not there yet and it
_sometimes_ is useful not to suspend a console even if we know that it will
break things.
