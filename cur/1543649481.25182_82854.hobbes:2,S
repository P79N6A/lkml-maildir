.text.lock.namei means that it hung in the slow path of a spinlock that
is referenced from namei.c
name.810 is a static data variable, probably the static char name[]
shown above. Remember the kernel backtrace is not exact and can print
random stack junk that looks like return addresses too. You always have 
to sanity check each entry.

addr2line -e vmlinux ... does this when you compile the kernel with -g
