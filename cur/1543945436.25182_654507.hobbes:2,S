I've done some work on cleaning up the definitions of pci_device_id to
make them "static const" (where possible) and to make sure they go into
__devinitconst.  There are about 350 changes of the type shown in the
diff at the end of this mail.
﻿All these changes are in my public GIT tree at:
git://www.southpole.se/~jonas/git/linux.git
(Based on 2.6.25-rc2)
In addition to these pci_device_id changes, there are a few changesets
that move "const" data from __devinitdata to __devinitconst.
The tree above builds with both allmodconfig and allyesconfig.
