The advantage is that you can use them to store UCS-4.
Now, for file _contents_ this would be a compatibility disaster, which
is why UTF-8 is so convenient, but for file_names_ UCS-4 lets you
unambiguously represent any string of Unicode characters.  Basically -
no more multiple representations of the same thing.  No more funny
corner cases where several different strings of bytes eventually
resolve to the same name being presented to the user.
Of course, there is still the issue where the same glyphs could be
displayed on the screen for two files, for example, one called
"vertical bar", and the other one called "pipe", which is confusing,
but that's a _completely_ different issue.
As far as I can see, storing all filenames as either 7-bit ASCII or
flat UCS-4 simply eliminates the whole lot of security issues you're
thinking of.  If you never use non 7-bit ASCII, legacy applications
continue to work exactly as before.
John.
