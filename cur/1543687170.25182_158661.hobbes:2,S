Well, actually I don't want to burn down his time as long as I don't see a need
for it. Since I am pretty confident to make the box work in SMP under 2.4.20 a
memtest will most certainly not give any additional information, be it running
UP or SMP.
Instead I will invest another day and convert the whole system back to
reiserfs, because the ext3 fs cannot be used under 2.4.20 - I don't know why.
Additionally reiserfs is better for testing possible patches because it crashes
in much shorter time than ext3 setup.
2.4.20 setup gives me a simple testcase to prove people right or wrong that are
talking about a hardware issue.

Stephan
