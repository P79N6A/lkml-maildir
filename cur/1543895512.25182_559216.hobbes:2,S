Hello everyone,
I've moved the Btrfs pages here:
http://oss.oracle.com/projects/btrfs
Which gives us a bugzilla, mailing lists, and a somewhat more orderly
file download area.  There are links to my HG trees for sources as well.
The oss project area automagically creates a few different mailing
lists.  For now, btrfs-devel@oss.oracle.com and
btrfs-announce@oss.oracle.com will be used.
