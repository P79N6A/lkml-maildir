I agree.  I would first create generational epochs from the driver:
21140 class, 21143 class, etc, things clearly distinguishable by the
chip's capabilities.  The 21140 doesn't support Nway, as an example,
so there are many branches in tulip.c v0.9x that aren't appropriate.
This would solve issues around the stability of older systems with
newer kernels, which I agree is an absolutely paramount objective.
For tulip (which I know best, Donald has 20 something drivers out
there), v0.89H is actually exactly that.  It would just need to be
trimmed to only handle the 21140 class devices that it can handle. 
I've had horrible experiences with it attempting to handle 21143s.
The new PCI resource scheme actually makes this easier to manage.

I agree again.  I think classification by similarity is actually an
evil thing, not because it doesn't work the first time, or the first N
times, but because the flow and logic of the driver becomes contorted,
and side effects begin to appear, and then maintenance becomes a
serious issue, and suddenly you hit the wall. I view the
all-tulip-work-alikes in one single driver as an example.

Dividing code is a normal and logical thing. To use a poor analogy,
flowers grow, and at a certain point the gardener divides the plant to
allow it to keep growing. I've been thinking this about tulip.c for a
while, but I wasn't going to instigate anything.  
What holds me back is my respect for Donald: he has been very generous
of his time with me, and he has created an enourmous body of code that
is very sucessful. I agree with your comments on the process, and want
to fix it without pissing on Donald.
