Something I was wondering...  would the following make sense/be a good
idea in today's net drivers?
netdev_interrupt()
	stop card from generating interrupts (IntrMask &= ~(TX|RX))
	if (status & (TX|RX))
		mark tasklet/softirq
	{ handle weird interrupts like RxErr, etc. }
netdev_tasklet()
	while (h/w status == Rx or Tx present)
		handle rx
		handle tx
		if (work_count++ == 20)
			if (current->need_resched)
				schedule()
	enable card interrupts (IntrMask |= (TX|RX))
I've always thought that REDUCING not increasing work done in interrupts
was the right way to go...
