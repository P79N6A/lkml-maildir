Right now, it is possible to build our largest Altix configuration with
64TB of memory (unfortunatetly, we can't get any customers to pay that
large of bill ;).  We are currently shipping a few 4TB systems and hope
to be selling 20TB systems by the end of the year (at least engineering
hopes to).
Given that, two decimal places are really not enough.  We probably need
at least 3.
Is there any reason to not do 3 places?  Is this the right direction to
head or does anybody know of problems this would cause?
Thanks,
Robin Holt
