First of all, a lot of these are inlines, and they derive a chunk of
their benefit from being inline.  Second, even if bundled with the
kernel, which I'm not sure is wise, there is no reason they can't just
be turned into libraries.  *Some functions* you're right, can be
optimized this way, but I'm not sure if that justifies compiling them
into the kernel that way.
