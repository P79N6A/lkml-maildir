You coded it, you know what kernel facilities must be initialised
before your program (ABC) and what kernel code cannot be initialised
until after your program (XYZ).

static int __init foo_init(void) {
  ...
}
module_init(foo_init);
Automatically generates the correct code for a built in object and for
a module.  See include/linux/init.h and almost any drivers/net/*.c,
plip.c is a good example.

Do not edit .config, it is generated.  Edit a [Cc]onfig.in file, read
Documentation/kbuild/config-language.txt and look at the [Cc]onfig.in
file in the directory where you are putting your source.  Do not forget
to update Documentation/Configure.help.
