I don't see the problem there, either. If you're worried about tacking
an extra digit on the end when there already is a digit
(i.e. "/dev/sr0" becoming "/dev/sr00"), the answer is not to do it
that way. Have it become "/dev/sr0p1" instead. And with devfs it looks
even cleaner: "/dev/sr/c1b0t6u0" -> "/dev/sr/c1b0t6u0p1".
