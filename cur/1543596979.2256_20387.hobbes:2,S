This is not a problem at all, because UNIX does not guarantee that
a process will get at least one CPU slice every X seconds.
( read : UNIX is not a real time system )
soft-suspend "freezes" processes for several hours anyway ...
Note that there is a patch for hot replacing a kernel, which is equivalent
to rebooting, but much faster :
Two Kernel Monte (Linux loading Linux on x86)
