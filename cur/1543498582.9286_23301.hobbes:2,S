I do it like this:
copy the new kernel and system.map to /boot/linux-x.y.z (or
linuxxyz for simplicity) and /boot/system.map-x.y.z, and do make
modules_install.
The 'production' kernel has a link to from /linux.
I have a small script the takes a default lilo.conf.first (containing
a dos entry and one for /linux), adds all /boot/linux* kernels
as seperate entries, writes that to /etc/lilo.conf and runs lilo.
The rc.sysinit gets the linux version from uname and links 
/boot/System.map to the System.map-x.y.z. Works great for several years
now.
