Indeed. The fix tries to save the early-clobbered value of 'edi' in
another early-clobbered register ('edx') and is clearly wrong.
I suggest making 'strstr' an external function rather than an
inline. As it stands, it leaves no free general purpose registers for
the compiler to work with, so the optimization gain from inlining will
in any case be extremely limited.
Cheers,
