I think the key importance is event vs. error.  E.g., "overheating" is a
state, something that can be handled in user-space.  A driver piping out
"error 501" is, well, something different.
Personally, I am not against using kevent for driver events/errors, but
the exact scope needs to be decided by the community.  You do need a
kevent, though.
