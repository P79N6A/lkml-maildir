acpi_pm_read is capable of disappearing into  SMM traps which will make
it look very slow.

Its about right for some of the older VIA chipsets but if you are seeing
speed loss then we need to know precisely which kernels the speed dropped
at. Could be there is an I/O scheduling issue your system shows up or
some kind of PCI bus contention when both disks are active at once.

Nope.
