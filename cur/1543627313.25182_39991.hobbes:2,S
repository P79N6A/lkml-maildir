Maybe if everyone ever bothered to look at the code base and not assume
they know everything ... and enjoying feable attempts to cast me as a
fool.  Better yet maybe understand the hardware ...
ata_input_data
        io_32bit = drive->io_32bit;
        if (io_32bit)
		insl(IDE_DATA_REG, buffer, wcount);
	else
                insw(IDE_DATA_REG, buffer, wcount<<1);
or 
ata_output_data
        io_32bit = drive->io_32bit;
        if (io_32bit)
                outsl(IDE_DATA_REG, buffer, wcount);
        else
                outsw(IDE_DATA_REG, buffer, wcount<<1);
WHOA is it not obvious it is the total number of calls to the same damn
DATA-TASKFILE-REGISTER-PORT
Which is only SIXTEEN BITS WIDE!
So please contine to write 32 bits to a 16 bit wide address...
Legacy or not the physical layer to the device, so please go look there.
Why do I even bother, all of you are so much smarter than me.
