But this change increased lifetimes of _all_ pages, so this is
irrelevant. Consequently, it has a chance of increasing scanning
activity, because there will be more referenced pages at the cold tail
of the inactive list.
And --again-- this erases information about relative order of
references, and this is important. In the past, several VM modifications
(like split inactive_clean and inactive_dirty lists) were tried that had
various advantages over current scanner, but maintained weaker LRU, and
they all were found to degrade horribly under certain easy triggerable
conditions.
