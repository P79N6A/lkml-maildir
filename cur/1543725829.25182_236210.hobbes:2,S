Ok, but cpu_to_phys_group() does a lookup in cpu_sibling map:
__init static int cpu_to_phys_group(int cpu)
{
        return first_cpu(cpu_sibling_map[cpu]);
}
and is called from outside of a CONFIG_SCHED_SMT ifdef here:
                sd = &per_cpu(phys_domains, i);
==>             group = cpu_to_phys_group(i);
                *sd = SD_CPU_INIT;
                sd->span = nodemask;
                sd->parent = p;
                sd->groups = &sched_group_phys[group];
#ifdef CONFIG_SCHED_SMT
                p = sd;
                sd = &per_cpu(cpu_domains, i);
