Hello all,
	I recently updated my corporate masquerading box to 2.2.1 using
IPchains and IPmasqadm. Everything works fine from Linux clients behind
the box, but occasionally Win95 boxes just stop sending packets. We
originally thought this might be related to ARP requests, but I'm not sure
anymore. I think that something might be getting munged in the TCP packets
causing the Win95 TCP stack to crash, but I can't be sure.
	Win95 workstations seem to work fine for a random amount of time,
and then they just stop sending packets. A reboot fixes the problem on the
Win95 side of things, but they just eventually die.
	I haven't had the opportunity to get a detailed TCPdump or any
other information at this point, because I've had to revert the production
box back to 2.0.36 to stop my phone ringing from pissed off employees
having to reboot their workstations.
	Has anyone else experienced a similar problem? If so, are there
any pointers or clues as to where this problem might lie?
	If not, I may be able to setup a test case in our LAB here and
capture some TCPdumps for the gurus.
	I've heard rumblings of 2.2.1-ac6 fixing some TCP related issues
and have been pointed towards that, but I don't have any specific
information on what it fixes.. Pointers would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Greg
