Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this already the case?
Are there not several uses of 2.0.x that are not compatible with
2.2/2.4?  And if 2.0 is working, then why are you worried about
being able to use 3.2?  Why do we need to maintain compatibility
with OLD (not 'low-end' but OLD) hardware if there's an existing
kernel that meets that hardware's needs already?
