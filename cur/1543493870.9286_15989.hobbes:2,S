You picked a good day to ask:
| From:  Craig Southeren <craigs@equival.com.au>
| To:    openh323 <openh323@equival.net>
| 
| To all,
| 
| I though that everyone associated with OpenH323 might be interested in
| hearing that a new significant milestone was reached today.
| 
| Today, at approximately 3:00pm AEST, the OpenH323 source code
received,
| decoded and played an audio stream in real-time via an H.323 session
from a
| Windows PC running NetMeeting. This long-awaited event has been
denoted
| "First Noise", and it's accomplishment shows that OpenH323 can now
start to
| perform useful work in the H.323 protocol arena.
