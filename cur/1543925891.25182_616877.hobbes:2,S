Hi Peter,
Yup, =g wasn't what I was looking for at all, the header comment is
bogus.
From
http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Simple-Constraints.html#Simple-Constraints
`r'
    A register operand is allowed provided that it is in a general register.
From
http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Machine-Constraints.html#Machine-Constraints
Intel 386   config/i386/constraints.md
q
    Any register accessible as rl. In 32-bit mode, a, b, c, and d; in 64-bit mode, any integer register. 
I am worried that "=q" might exclude the si and di registers in 32-bit mode.
What exactly is wrong with "=r" ?
