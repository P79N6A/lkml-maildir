Why wasn't this done in the first place anyway? 
Some sysadmins like to disable the other boot devices and password-protect
the bios.  Good, but if the person can pass init=, you're screwed. 
Here's a small patch that does a very simple thing: Disables "init=" and
using /bin/sh for init. That'll stop people from rooting the box from grub.

+Secure init
+CONFIG_SECURE_INIT
+  Under normal circumstances, the kernel tries the following at boot
+  as init:
+
+    /sbin/init
+    /etc/init
+    /bin/init
+    /bin/sh
+
+  This can be overridden by passing init= to the kernel command line.
+  This is a security hazard.  If you say 'Y' here, init= will be
+  ignored (actually it will flash a warning at boot time), and /bin/sh
+  will also never be used as init.  This prevents users with physical
+  access to the machine from gaining root access by passing
+  init=/bin/bash to the kernel.
+
+  It is common to pass init=/bin/bash to the kernel to fix really
+  messed up machines.  If you say 'Y' here, you should make sure you
+  have a boot floppy with a kernel compiled with normal init code, OR
+  a rescue system such as a boot/root floppy or a Knoppix CD.
+
+  Most users should say 'Y' here, unless you know you will not have
+  access to alternate recovery methods as listed in the above
+  paragraph.

   Unless you really know what you are doing, you should say Y here.
