Thanks for the kmod. Kernel crashed doing this:
     e00:       8b 43 30                mov    0x30(%ebx),%eax
...which checks out with the register dump. %ebx is 0x69000000.
and the address we failed to look up was 0x69000030.
My guess from a cursory look at the assembly is that %ebx should be
holding a pointer to cifs_sb. It's referenced quite a few times, but
doesn't seem to change until just before returning from the function.
The interesting bit is that there are a lot of other places  (even some
that look like they've probably already been traversed) in this code
where %ebx is dereferenced but they didn't trigger the problem...
That said, there's a lot of jumping around in this assembly code and
it's not completely clear to me how it got to the point where it crashed.
We'll probably need to see if this can be independently reproduced. Can
you email along the details of how you're reproducing this? In
particular:
1) all mount options being used
2) details on the server (what OS, what version of samba, etc)
3) version of mount.cifs being used
