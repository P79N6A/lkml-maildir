	Please don't start the post with a negative tone; focus on a 
problem in software rather than on insulting the people from whom you want 
help.
	Please take a look at /usr/src/linux/REPORTING-BUGS.  At an
absolute minimum, the people on this list can't do anything at all until
you tell us what kernel version you're using, what modules are loaded,
etc. - all things that that file is designed to uncover.  You might also
want to mention what Linux distribution you're using.  Did you compile the
kernel yourself, or are you using a vendor-supplied kernel?  If it's from
your vendor, have you updated it to the most current for your
distribution?  If you compiled it yourself, what compile options did you
use?  Did you apply any patches to the source?

	Does the system pass a night's worth of memtest86 successfully?  
If we can rule out hardware, that narrows the problem space down some.

	"Acts dead" - what does that mean?  Sluggish?  Pauses for a few 
seconds, then returns to normal?  Swapping madly?  For how long?  Hard 
lockup, no keys do anything?  Does the caps lock key change the state of 
the caps lock led?  Do the caps/scroll/numlock lights flash on and off 
without keypresses?  Does anything show up in the logs on next boot?  Can 
you kill X11 with Ctrl-Alt-Backspace?  Can you reboot the box with 
Ctrl-Alt-Del?  Does Sysrq-S force disk activity?  Can you ssh in from 
another box when it "acts dead"?

	What are the last few lines from "vmstat 1" when the system 
freezes?  Does top show any memory amounts=0?  What does top claim is the 
biggest memory user, both in the header area and down in application 
space?
	Can you make the problem occur with fewer programs, say, just with 
Mozilla, or just with Unreal?  How long does it take for the problem to 
show up?  Minutes, hours, days?

	If you'd prefer, feel free.  You do remember that the people from 
whom you're asking help have day jobs too, right?  *grin*
