How does zeroing help if they steal the laptop?  The data is there, they
can just pull the hard disk out and mirror it before they boot.
The only way to improve security here is to encrypt it.  Zeroing will
help some if they compromise root later, but I doubt that's really worth
it considering you're screwed after a root compromise anyway.
