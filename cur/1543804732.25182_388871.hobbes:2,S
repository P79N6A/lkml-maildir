No need to send an entire .config file with it.
In Kconfig help, use "compressed".
I need more help on the BLK_CBD_DEVICE option.
What does it do?
Please fix the indentation after
+#ifndef CBD_PARTITION
in cbd_int.c
Try to limit lines to < 80 characters each.
Use spaces around operators (=, <, >, <=, >=, etc).
Use space after "if", "for", and "while".
Has some funky indenting (use tabs instead of spaces).
Don't use typedefs.
Don't use typedef struct S { ... } S_t;
struct partition_info &
struct cbd_part_hdr seem to expect that ushort, uint,
etc., have fixed sizes, but they can actually vary by
architecture, so you should use known fixed sizes
anywhere that field & struct sizes matter.
Use ALIGN() from kernel.h instead of your own align() macro.
Lots of trailing whitespace.  Don't do that:
Warning: trailing whitespace in lines 41,58,102,104,106,137,198,234 of include/linux/cbd.h
Warning: trailing whitespace in lines 348,355 of drivers/block/Kconfig
Warning: trailing whitespace in lines 32,72,138,158 of drivers/block/cbd_int.c
Warning: trailing whitespace in lines 7,50,95,162,240,318,428,516,613,657,658,669,704,747,797,808,813,817,827,872 of drivers/block/cbd_main.c
Has about 25 gcc warnings when I build it.
