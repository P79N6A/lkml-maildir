This is presumably because the machine is full of memory which
is dirty against a slooow device.
You can work around this by reducing the dirty memory thresholds:
akpm-1:/home/akpm> cat /proc/sys/vm/bdflush
30      64      64      256     30000   3000    60      0       0
Make the "30" and "60" smaller.  10 and 20 perhaps.
Better: change the application to fsync() the data every few
megabytes, or open O_SYNC.
