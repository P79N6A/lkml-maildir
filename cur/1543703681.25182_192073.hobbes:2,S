When I started the 2.5 extable consolidation, I stopped where you see today,
becuase I realized that we'd need to move "range" extable entries to a
separate section (empty on most archs) and every arch would need to supply a
cmp function for sorting each one.  Add in rth's point about needing a swap
fn, I think that it's simpler to leave it as is, maybe with a module.c call
to extable_sort() for archs which care to implement.
Cheers,
Rusty.
