In the ____cache_alloc() kmemleak clears the
cachep->array->entry[ac->avail] pointer but this may not be enough as
freed and later re-allocated objects may have pointers in the alien
cache (is that correct?). A better approach (haven't tried it yet) would
be not to scan objects allocated via alloc_arraycache() at all. However,
there is still the initarray_cache/generic which are automatically
scanned via the data section (unless I add an attribute to place them in
a different, not scanned, section).
