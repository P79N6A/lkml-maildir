No, I'm not using tagged command queueing. The 3ware controller is not a
real scsi controller, the driver just emulates one. It's a raid5 controller
that drives SATA disks. It has an internal request queue ("can_queu")
of 254 outstanding commands. Because that is way bigger than nr_requests
this happens - if I set nr_requests to 512, the problem goes away. But
that shouldn't happen ;)
I'm preparing a proof-of-concept patch now, if it works and I don't wedge
the remote machine I'm testing this on I'll post it in a few minutes.
Mike.
