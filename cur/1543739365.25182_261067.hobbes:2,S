This has come up several times on the ppc lists (but since we still
don't have archives back, nobody can search anyway). I dropped
2.4 and 2.5 patches in source.mvista.com:/pub/linuxppc/ a long
time ago.  You just need to update your board-specific fixup routine
in that version or just make a copy or remap_page_range() into your
driver and use u64 for the phys address.
The real fix, of course, is in the -mm tree as remap_pfn_range(),
I plan to merge 440 io_remap_page_range() support on top of that
call when it goes into mainline. But that doesn't help you with
2.4. :)
