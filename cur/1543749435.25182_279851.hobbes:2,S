To be excrutiatingly picky:
mS means millisiemens.  Siemens is the SI unit for
(trans)conductance.  Like all units named after people:
- its symbol (S) is capitalized;
- its name (siemens) is not (unless starting a sentence).
Note that since it's named after a person named Ernsr Werner von
Siemens, it's called "siemens" even in singular (1 S = 1 siemens).
According to normal English nomenclature then the plural would be
siemenses, but that doesn't seem to have caught on.
ms means milliseconds.  Seconds is the SI unit for time.  Like all
units not named after people:
- neither its symbol (s) nor its name (second) is capitalized.
