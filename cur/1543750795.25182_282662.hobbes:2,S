The point is, they'll have to deal with the burrden of any extra work
created as a result.   It's not the responsibility of the open source
developers.   Smart users pick hardware that is well supported by Linux
and doesn't run the risk of becoming obsolete the day the manufacturer
decides they don't want to provide drivers any longer.
