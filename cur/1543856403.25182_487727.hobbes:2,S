Which is done bloody rarely.  grep and you'll see...  BTW, there are
other reasons why passing struct timer_list * is wrong:
	* direct calls of the timer callback
	* callback being the same for two timers embedded into
different structs
	* see a timer callback, decide it looks better as a tasklet.
What, need a different glue now?
Look, it's a delayed call.  The less glue we need, the better - the
rules are much simpler that way, so that alone means that we'll get
fewer fsckups.
