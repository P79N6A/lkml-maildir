That's silly.  He clearly should not have to...   just like he should 
not have to add code to figure out if a device is MMCONFIG-active or not.
MMCONFIG should be all or none.  System vendors sure as hell will not be 
testing this crazy mixed-access model.  System vendors DO test the 
"always off" model, obviously, and the "always on" model is entering 
their testing regime as Vista certification looms and as Linux starts to 
find bugs.
Just Say No to entering "hw vendor never ever tests it this way" land.
