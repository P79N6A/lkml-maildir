No, that would be correct English.

Actually, something like Strunk&White's "Elements of Style" is better suited
to this sort of thing than the OED.  The OED just lists *words*, not how to
put them together.

They would *affect* tasks. The *effect* of this would be...
Note that 'effect' can be a verb too, but in that sense it refers to
a "facilitator" - "The mayor effected change in policy" meaning that he
made it happen. So in the kernel, "A effects B" is only correct if A
is code that is intended to make B happen.  If A, through blind all-elbows
coding, happens to cause B to change, then "A affects B" is proper.
Clear as mud? :)  If not, read the Strunk&White explanation of this one. :)
