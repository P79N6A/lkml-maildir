If there is something people who do not speak SPARC-Assembler fluently
can do, let us know we would love to give you a hand...  Something like
"Gee look how it is done on sparc64 and bring sparc32 in sync" in case
something like this exists.
BTW. Are there any good online resources from which one good learn how
the real low-level stuff works.  You know  things like an architecture
manual, processor specs and so on. I tried to look around at sun.com but
gave up soon after...
