Just because you "normally" don't have problems doesn't mean that you still don't
have a hardware problem. 
Just a story to relate here, I had a system running 2.0.xx for about 2 years,
(pretty much as soon as 2.0 came out) and this system had over 200 day uptimes.
I installed 2.2.5 (redhat 6), recompiled the kernel, and started having
spurious crashes. After tearing my hair out over this stuff for about a week,
it turned out to be bad RAM.
From that day forth, I decided to always make sure I bought good quality
ECC RAM. 
FYI, I've also read recently on lkernel about someone else who ran extensive
memory tests, but the bad ram didn't show up until he did the "recompile
the kernel a few times" test. Replacing RAM fixed his problem too.
Considering the price of RAM and low-end pentium chips these days, it's worth 
swapping in a real pentium with a good heat sink/fan, new ECC RAM, and see what
happens...  If you still have probs, you can always return the parts.
IMHO, "Something" about 2.2 stresses the machine a bit more than 2.0, and this
seems to make intermittant hardware problems expose themselves. This is probably a
"good thing."
So I guess the moral of the story is, don't dismiss hardware problems too quickly.
They may surprise you.
