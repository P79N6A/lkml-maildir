But this just makes it a bit less racy than it used to be.
If we need locking around task->comm (and it seems that we do) then
let's do it.
void get_task_comm(char *buf, struct task_struct *tsk);
void set_task_comm(struct task_struct *tsk, char *buf);
It would be a bit lame to add a new lock for this - probably
task_lock() could be coopted.
