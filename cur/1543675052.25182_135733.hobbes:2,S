Indeed. I think its more the rule than the exception that non-x86 
architectures "get with the program" sometime during the stable release 
rather than before. There's just not a lot of incentive for the odd-ball 
architectures to care before the fact.
Would I prefer to have everything fixed by 2.6.0 (or even the pre-2.6 
kernels)? Sure, everybody would. But it's just a fact of life that we 
won't see people who care about the issues before that happens.
In fact, judging by past performance, a lot of things won't get fixed 
before the actual vendors have made _releases_ that use 2.6.x (and the 
first ones inevitably will have 2.4.x as a fall-back: that's only prudent 
and sane).
This is not just a core kernel issue - we've seen this with subsystems 
like ext3 and ReiserFS: they were "finished' and "stable", but what made 
them _really_ stable was a release or two on vendor kernels, and thousands 
of users.
