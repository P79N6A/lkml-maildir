But then 32 bit apps should be handled in a less restrictive fashion
than 64 bit apps, no? And also probably only for binaries that do
not have the exec_stack flag at all.
What I fail to understand then is why a 64 bit application with the
exec_stack flag set gets read_implies_exec and a 32 bit application
also with the exec_stack flag set does not (this is also the only case
where the behavior differs).
