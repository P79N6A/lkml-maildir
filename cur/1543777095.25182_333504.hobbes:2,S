I believe he is suggesting the addition of an sshfs, ftpfs, webdavfs,
etc. to the kernel, and allowing unprivileged users to mount these
filesystems.  (As a side note, I find it somewhat peculiar that he
includes smbfs in an example, since that is already implemented in the
kernel.)  Although he refers to possible implementation of these
facilities as reiserfs 4 plugins, it would seem far more straightforward
and useful to implement them as separate filesystems.  In fact, many of
these facilities already exist as filesystems for Linux.  For instance,
there is an sshfs program for FUSE, and FUSE already provides the
unprivileged mounting support mentioned in the proposal.
