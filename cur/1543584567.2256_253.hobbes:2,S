How can I detect that open() has been called on a file in procfs that a
module provides? If I modprobe my module, open one or more if its proc
entries, then rmmod the module while the proc files are still open, then
the deletion of those entries is deferred. When I close the file(s), the
kernel oopses. I need to be able to detect open() and close() in order
to increment/decrement the reference count for my module, to prevent it
from being rmmoded when in use. Any tips?
Thanks!
