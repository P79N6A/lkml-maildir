It probably broke suspend at some point... leave it there. Processes
can stay in D period, waiting for NFS server to come back.
and yes, we want nfs threads frozen, too (and anything that talks to
network). Speaking to nfs servers while we are suspending the machine
is not nice, and if that continues after snapshot, we'll act as a very
confused machine to the outside...
