The 'struct file' is allocated when the file is opened, so it is not
shared among users. Each user will therefore be able to cache his/her
own permissions. This is why I want to pass the file structure rather
than the 'dentry' structure to the readpage/writepage. The latter is
common to all users of the file, and can therefore not be used to pass
user/process-specific information.
Cheers,
