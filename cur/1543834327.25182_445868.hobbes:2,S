Subject: [RFC] GPU device layer patchset (00/07)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patchset contains 7 patches to implement the GPU device layer.
0001-drm-remove-local-copies-of-pci-bus-slot-func.txt
0002-drm-remove-pci-domain-local-copy.txt
0003-gpu-Initial-GPU-layer-addition.txt
0004-gpu-radeon-add-a-radeon-lowlevel-GPU-driver.txt
0005-gpu-radeonfb-add-GPU-support-to-radeonfb.txt
0006-gpu-drm-Add-GPU-layer-support-to-generic-DRM.txt
0007-drm-gpu-radeon-Add-radeon-DRM-support-to-use-GPU-layer.txt
The first two patches are changes to the DRM layer that I will submit separately
later but are required for this work.
The GPU layer generic code is in 0003 and 0006, radeon gpu driver 0004,
radeonfb in 0005 and radeon drm in 0007.
The code is also available in a git repo branch: 'gpu-branch'
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/airlied/gpu-2.6
This is the initial implementation for review.
Dave.
