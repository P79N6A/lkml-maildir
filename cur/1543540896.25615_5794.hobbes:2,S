I have it all time on differents configurations like
piii650 / 384megs ram + 700megs of swap running on 2.2.16
nothing to do with hardware and with ram/swap limit.
I keep thinking 2.2.x management of memory (or swap memory) 
is not clean. For exemple, when you need lot of memory quickly 
and you need to use swap (500megs), the process can take it but 
the state of thoses process becomes D. After the load is so high
that nothing works. The only solution is to reboot the server.
Then you can not umount the HD and fsck.ext2 takes 1h30 to check
some inode, but it is an another story :/
Hope it helps
