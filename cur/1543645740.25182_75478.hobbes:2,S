How big are the files?

You probably want to try creating the files in random order as well.  A
program to do that is attached, use in the form:
    randfiles <basename> <count> y
where 'y' means 'print the names', for debugging purposes.
What did your delete command look like, "rm -rf" or "echo * | xargs rm"?

Only 300,000 files, you haven't got enough to cause inode table thrashing,
though some kernels shrink the inode cache too agressively and that can
cause thrashing at lower numbers.  Maybe a bottleneck in the journal?
Not that anybody is going to complain about any of the above - it's still
running less than 1 ms/create, 2 ms/delete.  Still, it's slower than I'm
used to.
