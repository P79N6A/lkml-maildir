Hi,
I experience simular problems with 2.2.19(pre6) on a SMP machine at work.
Random lockups, tried removing SCSI adapter, sound card, replaced network
card all didn't help. My last action was replacing the videocard.....
Since then I havn't had any lockups, before they came at least once a day
but mostle almost every hour :-((
Mobo MSI 394D 2 x Copmin 677 MHz, 128 MB, no O.C. S3 video card.
regards
Kees
