Hi,
I've found numerious reports that Promise SX6000 works fine with
2.4.18+ kernels, and tried it with 2.4.18 and 2.4.19-rc1-ac4 kernels
with i2o support.
Here are the results:
2.4.18: finds controller, but doesn't find disk device on it.
2.4.19-rc1-ac4: loads i2o_block and i2o_core fine and doesn't load
i2o_pci. When I try to load i2o_pci manually, it shows a lot of
timeouts.
I seem to have PDC20276 chip (if i'm not mistaken) marked as new
by Alan Cox.
OS type on the RAID is set to Other.
When I try to run original driver Promise's driver instead of i2o on
2.4.18, it starts showing SCSI timeouts after some time when working
under heavy load.
I use RAID with ReiserFS.
Thanks for any help and have a nice day!
Best Wishes,
Viktors
