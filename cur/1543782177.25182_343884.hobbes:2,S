(It looks like my first try to send this message as a reply to the "Followup
..." didn't work. If it worked: sorry for double-post)
I use 2.6.13-rc6-mm1 which includes the patch as far as i can see, but
the C2 idle state (which my processor definetly supports) isn't
detected . it also isn't detected with 2.6.13-rc6 or 2.6.12.5 . but it definetly
worked with some older 2.6.x kernel.
is there any way to enforce using c2 ? so that you could say that the
acpi system uses c2 even if it is unable to detect that it is supported
?
