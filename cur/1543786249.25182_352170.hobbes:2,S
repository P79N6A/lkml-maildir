Subject: [PATCH 04/10] IPoIB: Fix SA client retransmission strategy
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Hal Rosenstock <halr@voltaire.com>
We got a little mixed up with what the backoff member holds in the
IPoIB multicast group structure: sometimes it was used as a number of
seconds, and sometimes it was used as a number of jiffies.  Fix the
code so that backoff is always in seconds.
