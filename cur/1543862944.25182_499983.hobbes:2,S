The problems are almost certainly to do with the driver (or lack of
driver) for your hard disc interface. There will be earlier messages
(and more importantly a lack of messages showing hardware being
detected) that end with failure to mount your root partition.
The configuration options for SATA moved in 2.6.19.
They are now under
  Device Drivers -> 
    Serial ATA (prod) and Parallel ATA (experimental) drivers 
> I've searched in changelog but nothing found.
The error messages are as a result of the keyboard LEDs being flashed.

Try booting with i8042.panicblink=0
