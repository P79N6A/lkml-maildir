This rule exists so that implementations are not forced to issue a

According to the standard, you say that you want to cast p to type
int.  You cannot manipulate machine addresses in C because C is
defined as a high-level language, without backdoors to such low-level
concepts as machine addresses.
The fact that quite a few implementations traditionally provide
such backdoors in some cases does not mean that the C language is a
low-level language, or that all implementations (even future ones)
have to provide these backdoors.

I don't think there are fundamental and conceptual changes in C99 in
this area.  Even with previous C reversions, you should have read the
compiler manual carefully before doing address arithmetic.
