I really think that this should be cleaned up to _not_ confuse the issue 
of TSC with any "secure computing" issue.
The two have nothing to do with each other from a technical standpoint. 
Just make the flag be called "TIF_NOTSC", and then any random usage 
(whether it be seccomp or anything else) can just set that flag, the same 
way ioperm() sets TIF_IO_BITMAP.
Much cleaner. 
There's no point in mixing up an implementation detail like SECCOMP with a 
feature like this.
