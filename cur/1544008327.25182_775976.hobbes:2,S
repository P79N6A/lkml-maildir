Wouldn't this issue just go away if the code simply compared the full
pages, rather than skipping the hashed 128 bytes at the beginning?
Given the cost of this whole operation (which, it seems, can involve
copying one of the pages before testing for equality), skipping the
comparison of 128 bytes seems like a bit of a premature optimization.
