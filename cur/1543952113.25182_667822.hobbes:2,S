This hurts my brain.
If your usage pattern is:
struct foo {
	...
	struct list_head bar_list;	/* A list of `struct bar's */
};
struct bar {
	struct list_head list;		/* Attached to foo.bar_list */
	...
};
then yes, list_singleton() makes sense.
But in other usage patterns it does not:
struct foo {
	struct bar *bar_list;
	...
};
struct bar {
	struct list_head list;		/* All the other bars go here */
	...
};
In the second case, emptiness is signified by foo.bar_list==NULL.  And in
this case, code which does
	if (foo->bar_list && list_singleton(&foo->bar_list->list))
will fail if there is a single item on the list!
The second usage pattern is uncommon and list_empty() also returns
misleading answers when list_heads are used this way.
So I guess we can proceed with your list_singleton(), but I'd just like to
flag this possible confusion, see what people think..
