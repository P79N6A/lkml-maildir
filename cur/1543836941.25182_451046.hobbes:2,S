A debug printk escaped with that patch. Here's the proper patch.

[PATCH] Chardev checking of overlapping ranges is incorrect.
The current code in register_chrdev_region() attempts to check 
for overlapping regions of minor device numbers, but performs 
that check incorrectly. For example, if a device with minor 
numbers 128, 129, 130 is registered first, and a device with 
minor number 3,4,5 is registered later, then the later range
is incorrectly identified as "overlapping" (since 130>3), 
when clearly this is the wrong conclusion.
This patch fixes the overlap check to work correctly.
