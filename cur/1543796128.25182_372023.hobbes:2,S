Please be precise, there is of course a common base, but it's not the 
same. In sports a timeout is the actual event that interrupts something. 
In code it's a time _period_ until an exceptional event. A timer delivers 
an asynchronous event after a specified timeout, so they're always 
"unexpected and exceptional". (You can of course constantly poll the timer 
to make it a little less unexpected, but then you don't really need to set 
a timer in first place.)
bye, Roman
