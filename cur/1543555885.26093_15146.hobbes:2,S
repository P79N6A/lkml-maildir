Subject: 2.4.0-test11-ac2 and ac4 SMP will not run KDE 2.0

When I try to start KDE 2.0 with SMP builds
of 2.4.0-test11-ac2 and ac4, the system locks up
after "Loading Panel". Nothing odd gets logged
to /var/log/messages.
I can successfully run KDE 2.0 with UP builds 
of any of these kernels.
I can successfully run Gnome or Fvwm1 with
either UP or SMP builds of any of these kernels.
This table summarizes my experience with KDE 2.0
with recent 2.4.0-test11 and later kernels:
		UP	SMP
test11		OK	OK
test11-ac1	OK	OK
test11-ac2	OK	FAILS
test11-ac3	NOT TESTED
test11-ac4	OK	FAILS
The 2.4.0-test11-ac1 SMP kernel which successfully
runs KDE 2.0 has my small patch to
linux/include/asm-i386/hardirq.h which allowed an
SMP kernel to be built for test11-ac1.
The base distribution of this system is
Linux-Mandrake 7.2. The hardware is a Dell
Precision 420 Dual P-III. All kernels are patched with
linux-2.4.0-test10-reiserfs-3.6.19-patch.
