Subject: [PATCH] ACPI pci irq routing fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

If irq.active is set from _CRS, make sure to use it, rather than trying
anything from the from the _PRS list, as some machines don't handle this
properly.  This patch is against current linux-acpi-test-2.6.0.  It's
been floating about for a while, and fixes bug #1186.
Patch originally from Andrew de Quincey.
thanks,
