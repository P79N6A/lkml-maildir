Hi list,
After reboot in kernel 2.4.15-pre9 this problem occur:
On try start syslog deamon occur this errrors "Input/output error" on many archives /var directory.
I mount the /var at boot linux single, and when try ls on /var/run list all archives .pid, 
before try ls -la on /var/run, not list all archives.
Try remove .pid archives and the error occur again.
/var partition use ext2
Any suggestion?
Tanks in advance,
Regards
Marcus Grando
