Ok its a bit better than a single PII 400 MHz :-)
... with less than 64MB the break downs are going to be the common state
whereas with 128MB the system is usable.  Nevertheless whenever both make
loops taking the filesystem tree at the same time, the system performance
slows down dramatically (a `break down').

This hypothetical bit should only be set if the page is read physical
from the swap device/file.  That means it would take one step more
to swap out this page again (test_and_clear_bit of both 
PG_recently_swapped_in and PG_referenced).
