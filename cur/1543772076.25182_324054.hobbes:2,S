I think this is a feature, not a bug, and I suspect you just broke
compiling a 64-bit kernel by default on ppc64.
Dammit, the system _is_ ppc64. The fact that the uname binary is not is
neither here nor there. It's like x86 that reports i386/i486/.. depending 
on what the machine is. If uname wants to make it clear that uname has 
been compiled for 32-bit ppc, then it can damn well output "ppc" on its 
own without asking the kernel what the kernel is.
