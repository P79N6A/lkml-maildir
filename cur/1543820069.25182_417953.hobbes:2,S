You could (at least from memory, on certain chipsets) modify the error 
reporting registers so that an SMI is no longer generated as a result of 
MC ECC errors.  True, this doesn't fix many of the other problems 
related to this issue, but would be useful in a "modprobe xyz_edac 
force_unhide_MC_PCI=1" case.
Closed-source BIOSes eh?  Who needs em ;-p.
