Indeed it does, i'm beginning to wonder if the problem is in the mpparse
code for boxes such as Andrew's which get broken. Because really if we
overwrite the previous entry then this is acting very much like what the
function says it does. The only thing which i think makes things look
awkward with your patch is;
        for (i = 0; i < mp_irq_entries; i++) {
                if ((mp_irqs[i].mpc_srcbus == intsrc.mpc_srcbus)
                      && (mp_irqs[i].mpc_srcbusirq == intsrc.mpc_srcbusirq)) {
                        mp_irqs[i] = intsrc;
  +                     if (intsrc.mpc_srcbusirq > pin) { <=======
  +                            int j;
  +                            for (j = 0; j < i; j++)
  +                                   if (mp_irqs[j].mpc_dstirq == intsrc.mpc_dstirq)
  +                                         mp_irqs[j].mpc_irqtype = -1;
  +                     }
                        found = 1;
                        break;
                }
        }
That just happens to get boxes like Andrew's out of the path because his
only gets broken with the irq0 override.
