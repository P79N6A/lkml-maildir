Hmmm arch/alpha/mm/init.c has this:
                if (tmp >= MAX_DMA_ADDRESS)
                        clear_bit(PG_DMA, &mem_map[MAP_NR(tmp)].flags);
My guess is that MAX_DMA_ADDRESS on the Pyrix is defined to be the
entire memory space.
Time to introduce GFP_DMA_24BIT, GFP_DMA_1GB and GFP_DMA_2GB to
support all those crappy devices on the market.
