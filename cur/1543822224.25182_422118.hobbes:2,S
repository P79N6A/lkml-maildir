You ask the BIOS vendor for the exact board in question.
If you want to ask the processor itself then you can use the model
specific registers. These are accessible via /dev/cpu/<cpuid>/msr so you
can perform the Intel recommended sequence for checking if the processor
has HT enabled.
It might be simpler to look in /proc/cpuinfo if you just need the basic
information
