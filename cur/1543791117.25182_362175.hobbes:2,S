Yes, that's what I read quite a time ago, and it appears that it was an
interpretation of the spec which is not true anymore with LLP64 models :-(

I don't know if x86_64 is LP64 or LLP64 on Linux, but at least my alpha
and sparc64 are LP64, so is another PPC64 I use for code validation.
LPC64 is the recommended model for easier 32 to 64 portability (where
ints are 32 ; long, longlong, ptrs are 64).
There's an interesting reading about this here :

So Matt, you have to use void* or char* in your types.

Thanks Geert for the notification, it was an opportunity to refresh my
thoughts about portability practices. I think it will be time to buy
an x86_64 :-/
