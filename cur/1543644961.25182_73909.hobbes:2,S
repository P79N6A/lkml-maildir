Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.20-pre8 - Config.in: Second extended fs rename / move Ext3 to a wiser place
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi there,
these are just cosmetic fixes.
I think we can do the following:
1. rename: "Second extended fs support" to "Ext2 file system support"
    (to be equal to Ext3fs)
2. move: "Ext3 journalling file system support" near under to Ext2 fs.
Coments?
Marcello, if ok, please apply.
