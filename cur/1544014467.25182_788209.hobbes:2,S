I do not understand two things.
	a) WTF would we care about ones in vmlinux, when kallsyms drops the
absolute ones anyway?
	b) is there any reason why we can't copy symbol table out of module
ourselves (instead of setting SHF_ALLOC on it) and trim the crap out of
it?  Note that __crc_... is not the only junk in there - you don't need
(or want) to keep the things like undefs for /proc/kallsyms purposes.
And modules *using* an exported symbol are more common that modules exporting
one...  Why not copy it at add_kallsyms() time, skipping the junk we don't
want anyway?
