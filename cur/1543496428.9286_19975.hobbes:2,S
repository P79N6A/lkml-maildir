I bet the final good setting for determining the kind (edge or level trigger)
of interrupts is the following:
If the SMP box has no interrupts table in the Bios and the ELCR register
value is not the one of an empty io port, then rely on it.
In other words, use the behaviour given by setting USE_ELCR_TRIGGER_LEVEL
in 2.2.5 if and only if both the Bios interrupts table is empty and the
ELCR register value is not the one of an empty io port.
Please notice that during the 2.1.x serie, the fact that the Bios table
was empty has not been used as a way to determine if we should rely on ELCR,
and it was probably the missing point.
PS: You must not rely on the kind of bus because my box is ISA+PCI, no EISA,
    yet has a valid ELCR register.
