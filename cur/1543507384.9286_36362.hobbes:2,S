Hello,
I have noticed an unpleasant behavior of vfat kernel driver when
working with win partitions. I am not sure, if there is any
reason for what's going on, but if it is, yell at me...
First annoying thing that happens to me quite often ( can't swear
it is 100% all the time ) is creation of directiories under linux
and working with them under windows. When I create directory
'test' for example ( in lowercase ), I see it as 'TEST' in uppercase
in windoze... Linux 'TEST' was 'test' in windows again... simply..
mismatched case... However, 'Test' produces what is expected.
The second thing is, that I can't rename one directory to
one with the same name, but with different case. I know that
windows ( 98 at least ) do ignore filename case, but I think
vfat driver could recognize I am trying to rename the directory,
not trying to move it anywhere...
Can somebody look at this ?
Thanks
Petr Sebor
