Show my a BIOS that isn't broken.
I'm serious, EVERY SINGLE MACHINE at my disposal of late has had
buggy ACPI tables or worse.
Ironically, many laptops use a Pheonix BIOS who traditionaly have had
terrible QA too --- their bioses APM would only work under Windows95
initially and then later Windows98.
I'm really started to wish the OpenBios folks had more resources
available; the quality of the average BIOS it seems in the last
couple fo years is really bad.
