I cannot imagine viewing the entire filesystem as a single huge XML file. 
My suggestion is to add a framework, an infrastructure, in the VFS
wherein a simple plugin can be written to poke into the file as if it
were a directory. So with that framework in place, I can write a
plugin for archive support (treating the .tar files as directories),
Peter could write a plugin for poking into /etc/passwd (treating it as
a directory), and Jon Doe could write a plugin for sendmail.cf
like:
--
struct file_operations ops = {
   .read            = tar_readdir,
   .readdir        = tar_readdir,
   ......
};
register_file_type("tar", &ops);
--
How good would this be?

May the source be with you.
