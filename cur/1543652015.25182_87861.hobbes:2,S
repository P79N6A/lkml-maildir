Subject: [BUG] 2.5.46 reloading a block device module doesn't probe devices

I just converted the DAC960 driver in 2.5.46 to use the pci_register_driver()
to discover devices.
I've been experimenting loading the DAC960 driver module, unloading
the module, and then loading it again.  I get curious behavior.
The load, unload seem to work fine.
The reload also APPEARS to succeed. The insmod command completes
with a successful status.
But the second loading of the driver never calls the driver's probe routines.
I added printfs, and determined that the module_init() function
DOES get called the second time.  But a printf in the probe() routine
doesn't show up the second time.
Has there been a patch recently for this problem?
Thanks!
