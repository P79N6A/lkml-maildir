No. Simply for security purposes we _definitely_ need to "de-thread" the
process when it does an exec. Otherwise we have "interesting" issues
with suid execs that are part of a non-suid thread group.
We could choose to just not allow suid execs, but I think they do
potentially make sense, and I don't see why Linux shouldn't allow a
thread to exec a suid binary (we break the shared VM part automatically,
we might as well break the shared thread part). 
Note that for _pthreads_ this kind of exec is illegal anyway.  Silly
POSIX threads standard had to take user-level threading models into
account, so under POSIX threads an execve() needs to kill off all other
threads.  Another senseless limitation - one that we can _emulate_, of
course, but not one that we should consider part of the native thread
environment. 
Btw, here's a simple thread-group patch.  It doesn't actually _do_
anything with the thread group part, but this is the kind of frame-work
I've envisioned.  Completely untested, of course, but with these kinds
of security issues taken into account.
Comments? At least it's small and simple..
