seems like serial console doesn't dump anything in my case.

i tried again with a 2.2 kernel. they don't seem to require _any_ mem=xxx 
parameters to work so i checked dmesg:
Linux version 2.2.20-idepci (herbert@gondolin) (gcc version 2.7.2.3) #1 Sat 
Apr 20 12:45:19 EST 2002
BIOS-provided physical RAM map:
 BIOS-e820: 0009f000 @ 00000000 (usuable)
 BIOS-e820: 1fdf0000 @ 00100000 (usuable)
Detected 2019977 kHz processor.
This is the same computer, same RAM, same Bios.
how comes e820 provides these different results ?
