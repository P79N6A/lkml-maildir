Fine advice, if the LSM exits had in fact been structured that way.
But the LSM hooks are where they are, and as a result not useful for
auditing.  As others noted, the current 2.6 kernel *does* have a separate
audit framework (although it will still report DAC failures in preference
to MAC failures).
I admit having no good idea how to solve that issue, other than having the
audit framework do a dummy LSM call to see if a MAC failure would have been
reported as well if it's an audited syscall.  But that's still quite high
on the bletcherous scale....
