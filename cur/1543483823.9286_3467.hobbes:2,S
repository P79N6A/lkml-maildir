Yes, there is a hardcoded limit of 15 partitions per device.  From
Docuementation/devices.txt:
  8 block       SCSI disk devices (0-15)
		...
                Partitions are handled in the same way as for IDE
                disks (see major number 3) except that the limit on
                partitions is 15.
The real issue here is the sparse and fixed allocation of minor device
numbers.  What would be /dev/sda16 is really the same device node as
/dev/sdb.  You may want to check into defvs, which handles device nodes
differently, or repartition the disk with fewer partitions.  [It kinda
sucks that IDE disks can have 63 partitions while SCSI can only have 15,
but this just shows one of the reasons devfs exists.]
