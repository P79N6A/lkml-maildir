What you mean by "stable" pretty much excludes any serious  
development, without which the Linux kernel would very soon be  
obsolete. If you want a stable system, then don't change it. If you  
update to a kernel which is 2.5 years newer, you simply cannot have  
stability, because that would mean stagnation, aka "death".
