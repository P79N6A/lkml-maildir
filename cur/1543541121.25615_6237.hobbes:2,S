I did NOT assume that your patch had been applied (I am the person behind
apm@linuxcare.com.au).  What my patch does is to ensure that interrupts
are explicitly enabled whenever we do a BIOS call (including the BIOS call
to suspend the machine) rather than just assuming that interrupts were
enabled.  This does work in my Thinkpad (admittedly a 600E).
I do not think that my patch is ugly and, in fact, implements the
semantics of the CONFIG option even better than before. :-)
Please try my patch ...
Cheers,
Stephen
