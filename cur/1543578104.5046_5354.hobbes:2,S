It has to do with ; "a label at the end of a compound statement..."
This has never been correctly allowed. Many don't realilize that
	case 'X':
	case 'Y':
	default:
... are all labels. Modern compilers are now enforcing the rules.
When a 'switch' is a compound statement, tt follows the rules for
other compound statements. For instance, you can code (correctly)
	switch(a) case 1: a--;
... this, with no braces at all. If a == 1, it gets changed to 0,
otherwise it is untouched. If we need another test, it becomes
a compound statement requiring braces as:
	switch(a) { case 1: a--; default: }
Observe that we have tricked the compiler into generating code without
using a ';' denoting the end of a statement. The standards makers don't
like this and and now requiring that the above be coded as:
	switch(a) { case 1: a--; default: ; }
	                                  ^___ no tricks allowed.
A 'program unit', denoted by {} braces has never required a terminating
semicolon, so putting a ';' at the end of the physical statement
just won't do it in this case.
