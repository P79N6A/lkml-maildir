It can't happen.  free_pte is called with the page_table_lock held in 
addition to having the mmap_sem downed.

This is already done in free_page_and_swap_cache.
There is a problem with a possible kernel panic in that
try_to_free_buffers is called with a wait of 1 (thanks to Andrew Morton
for pointing that out) and we might reschedule while we wait on io.  So,
to fix it, here is an even newer (and simpler) patch.  Everything is
handled in free_page_and_swap_cache, so we just call that if we can
successfully look up the entry.
