Yep, its a SysKonnect chip.

Problem is rather that the drivers in the kernel really outdated.

You can find the latest SysKonnect driver here:
  
http://www.syskonnect.de/syskonnect/support/driver/htm/sk98lin.htm
It is only for 2.2 and 2.4 though.
I have 'ported' the latest version (6.10) and a previous version or two
to 2.5, but I had similar issues as you .... I could ping the boxen on
my network, but cannot ssh for instance - basically its as if it only
do icmp and rarely actually send/receive other data.
I have also mailed SysKonnect, but they told me to speak to 3COM :/
Anyhow, if somebody want my efforts in the 2.5 port to get it working,
ask.  I however do not have time to struggle with it currently.
