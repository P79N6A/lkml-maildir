I'll sell you a custom-burned CD of the entire current Linux 
kernel source (in both compressed archive form and expanded 
directly compilable formats) for just $29.95!  I take payment
in personal checks, cash, and beer!  I'll even label the
CD package any way you like, even with your own name on it!
