Do you have a small test program to illustrate that bug? I have an A7V
with PCI Master Read Caching enabled and haven't seen any corruption so
far (which doesn't necessarily mean much). Or if you don't have a test
program, how did you identify it's caching too much?
Also, are you using a Thunderbird or a Duron?
I'm using the 1003 Bios, which has proven to be the most stable so far.
Which one do you use?
-Udo.
P.S. I seem to recall that later Bios Versions (>=1004) disable Master
     Read Caching by default, so maybe Asus has also noticed something
     wrong with it.
