This still wouldn't solve the following problems:
- I doubt it will be kept up to date for all > 2800 modules in the kernel
- the 3 year old kernel of your distribution would contain 3 year old
  maintainership information
- maintainers sometimes disappear
The default for "bug and defect reports" should be for all modules (as 
well as for non-modular code) from ftp.kernel.org kernels either 
linux-kernel or the kernel Bugzilla. [1]
For distribution kernels (which are what most users are using), the
default for "bug and defect reports" should be the distribution support.
