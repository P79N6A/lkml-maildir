Subject: [2.6 patch] let MAGIC_SYSRQ no longer depend on DEBUG_KERNEL
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I know several people using MAGIC_SYSRQ not for kernel debugging but for 
trying to do a halfway normal shutdown in case of problems.
Since there's no technical reason why MAGIC_SYSRQ would have to depend 
on DEBUG_KERNEL, I'm therefore suggesting to drop this dependency.
