You still dont answer my question. Please answer the question.
Recap : You have a max of XXXX events queued. A network message come and 
kernel want to add another event. It cannot because limit is reached. How the 
User Program knows that this problem was hit ?

I dont speak of re-allocation of ring buffer. I dont care to allocate at 
startup a big enough buffer.
Say you have allocated a ring buffer of 1024*1024 entries.
Then you queue 100 events per second, and dequeue them immediatly.
No need to blindly use all 1024*1024 slots in the ring buffer, doing 
index = (index+1)%(1024*1024)

So zap mmap() support completely, since it is not usable at all. We wont 
discuss on it.
