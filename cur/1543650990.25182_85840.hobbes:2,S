This seems to be true from what I have seen of the source so far.
I'm thinking....
ACPI is more than Power Management. The fact that a system supports ACPI does 
not mean that the user wants to use power management. On the other hand, I 
see no reason why a user does NOT want a system to auto poweroff, and sleep 
and suspend are easy to configure in BIOS, or by linux tools. (Does Linux 
take over the BIOS settings for suspend & sleep ? Don't use them, so 
donnow....) What I wanna say: I think it is okay if CONFIG_PM is replaced by 
CONFIG_APM || CONFIG_ACPI
Other issue: Are ACPI and APM not mutually exclusive ? If so, I would propose 
a selection box: <ACPI> <APM> <none> with related options shown below. Hmzz.. 
there the issue of the fact that ACPI is more than power management shows up 
again.
And well... CONFIG_APM || CONFIG_ACPI might look ugly to you, I think it isn't 
that bad, besides, you gain a lot from the configuration side. IMHO 
configuring the kernel has become hard enough with the new input layer 
already :( Maybe it is time for a "[ ] show expert options" in the 
configuration tool...
