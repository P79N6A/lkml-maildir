Will Linux find and name a SATAPI device?
Every 2.4 Linux I've tried connects with the SATAPI device I have.   
Knoppix Linux 2.4, my own kernel, etc.  Seemingly the 2.4 cdrom and  
ide-cd driver modules connect to SATAPI, same as PATAPI.  But 2.6  
introduces CONFIG_BLK_IDE_SATA.  drivers/ide/Kconfig explains why.
In my newbie ignorance, me, I think that explanation means to say that,  
by make defconfig, as yet you don't get SATAPI in 2.6, but you can  
still ask for it to work as well in 2.6 as in 2.4, except if you do ask  
for SATAPI you might lose SATAPI anyhow by losing support for the  
unusual SATA host you have.  However, I'm confident other people here  
in linux-ide understand this far far better than I.

P.S. What effects the ide-scsi and ide-floppy driver modules might have  
with SATAPI, I do not know.
