	Yes, the initrd seems to be required.  It happens when
the initrd attempts to mount /proc (it runs a shell script that
starts by setting PATH, mounting /dev, and mounting /proc).
	I've verified that under 2.5.52 the problem occurs with
CONFIG_HIGHME64G and not with CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G.  Actually, now the
problem is a BUG() at slab.c:1451, which is also memory corruption,
and I suspect just an evolution of the same problem from 2.5.40.
	Anyhow, in case it helps you, I've put the vmlinux and initrd
that produce this problem in
ftp://ftp.yggdrasil.com/private/adam/for-wli/.
  Note that the ramdisk
has kernel modules that don't match the kernel but that's not the
issue, as I configured that kernel to have a different version name.
       Thanks for your attention to this problem.
