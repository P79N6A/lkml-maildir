Well, I got a kernel compiled with your patches, but have not been able 
to test it yet. Last week the red laser crapped out on my sony 710A 
dvd/rw drive, so I got a new 810A and when I go to format the cd-rw with 
cdrwtool, the drive fails the write command with sense code 00.04.04, 
and then fails any commands after that and won't eject the disc until I 
do a hdparm -w. I guess the firmware is defective and craps itself when 
you try to do a packet mode write ( updating didn't help ), so I'm 
returning this drive and ordering the nice sata plextor one instead.
Will let you know when I get the new drive if your patch works out well 
or not.
