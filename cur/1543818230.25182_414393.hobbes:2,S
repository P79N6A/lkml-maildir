Your idea is interesting. Unfortunately it is not directly applicable, and
is more a "hack", than a solution.

Modifying gids is not a good idea, the sysadmin might need it for other
purposes.

It might be intended behaviour, or it might be a file descriptor leak.
If I have a rule in iptables saying to allow only apache (just an example)
access to port 80, I don't want any other program to have access to it.
If apache might leak a file descriptor (it doesn't, just an example), and
give access to other programs, the firewall would restrict those programs.
If I would implicitly trust them, then fireflier rules wouldn't be any
better, than just creating rules to allow any program to listen on port
80.

filtering is done on each packet, how could the socket be transfered
between the time the packet is filtered, and the time it is received by
the program?
A socket transfer can be done via execve, or IPC, both covered (I hope) by
the fireflier lsm.

This could be ensured from userspace, if it becomes an issue.

running a program via NFS, and giving access for it to the network? why
would I want that?
Anyway, if somebody wants that, we could determine the inode of the
program on nfs mount time. We could store the path+hash of the program to
be sure it is the same program.
>umount/mount?
Aren't inodes stored on the disk?

No need for suid though, fireflier-server runs as root.
