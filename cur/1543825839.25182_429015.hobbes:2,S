I think crash_kexec() is the best point to simplify notifier-call.
If the notifier is bad implementation, kdump reliability may
be decreased. But the risk depends on notifier quality.
I think it is not bad that we have the opportunity to call notifier.
As you say, current panic_notifier_list may not be suitable
because that was implemented before kdump merged.
You accept if panic_notifier_list is dropped from crash_notify()
like below(not complete patch)? If one want to catch panic
and SysRq event before crashing, crash_notifier_list can be used.

You are right, but that mechanism waists very long time.
The probability that fail in informing spare node of death is lower
than you think.
