Hello,
I have made a new version of the plug-and-play virtual
network based on UML.
you can try it at 
http://clownix.net
Uml virtual machines can be started and destroyed during 
run, the network topology can be modified during run.
It uses linux-2.6.25.1, the last one today.
Note: 350 megas to download, not good for low bandwidth internet links.
      4 gigas for the rootfs once unziped.
Regards
