I thought that gfs2 just appeared last month.  Or is it really still just gfs?  
If there are substantive changes from gfs to gfs2 then obviously they have 
had practically zero testing, let alone posted benchmarks, testimonials, etc.  
If it is really still just gfs then the silly-rename should be undone.
