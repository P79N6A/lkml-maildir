2.4.19-rc1 seems to be having trouble sending a SIGALRM process that
have been exec'd on one of my test boxes.  From the Linux Test Project,
alarm04 test:
sig_rev     1  FAIL  :  alarm() fails to send SIGALRM to execed
                                  process
Also, the gettimeofday02 test fails when execed from the test driver,
but not when you run it alone.  This test also sends a SIGALRM to know
when it's done.
Machine is a PIII-600
Thanks,
Paul Larson
