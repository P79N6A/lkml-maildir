GFP_KERNEL has to be able to fail for 2.4. Otherwise you can get everything
jammed in kernel space waiting on GFP_KERNEL and if the swapper cannot make
space you die.
The alternative approach where it cannot fail has to be at higher levels so
you can release other resources that might need freeing for deadlock avoidance
before you retry
