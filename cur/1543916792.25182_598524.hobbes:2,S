i bet fixing this will increase precision of group scheduling as well. 
Those long latencies can be thought of as noise as well, and the 
fair-scheduling "engine" might not be capable to offset all sources of 
noise. So generally, while we allow a certain amount of lag in 
preemption decisions (wakeup-granularity, etc.), with which the fairness 
engine will cope just fine, we do not want to allow unlimited lag.
