unfortunately that'd be very limiting and annoying on core2 processors 
which have dedicated perf counters for clocks unhalted (actual vs. 
nominal), but only 2 configurable perf counters.  i forget what ecx value 
gets you the dedicated counters... but a solution which might work would 
be a syscall to return the perf counter number...
or we could just merge perfmon ;)
