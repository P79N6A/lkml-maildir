Oops. I had missed the memset in ..info_fadt() in my stupid bug fixing
patch.
There is another patch here 
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4485
That touches the same code and doing memset in a loop turned out to be
useful
as we want to initialize only some of those states.

Regarding the last hunk in the patch below..
Actually, we want to have acpi_processor_idle() used even when only C1
is supported and that C1 has nothing to do with ACPI. The reason being
that there is no generic interface that can show the cstate usage and
time spent in cstate etc. We want to reuse the cstate statistics in
/proc interface in acpi_processor_idle(). However, in long term, this
needs a cleanup and a generic cstate handler is required (similar to
cpufreq for P-state) and acpi should just plugin the handler and latency
and similar details for each cstate into this generic cstate handler.
And I tried on couple of Xeons here and haven't had luck in reproducing
this hang yet. 
Thanks,
Venki
