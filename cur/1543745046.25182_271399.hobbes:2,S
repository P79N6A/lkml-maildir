All,
  I have developed a module that maps a given device's memory into user
space.
The module is very simple (see the source code attached). It just
defines the following file operations: open, release, ioctl and mmap.
   I'm having a problem in porting this module to the 2.6 series.
Apparently, everything is working fine but I just can't access the
device's memory (even tough I get a valid point from the mmap system
call).
    Can anyone help me?
Thanks in advance.
