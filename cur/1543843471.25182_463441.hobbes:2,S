I get this message at boot on 2.6.18-rc6:
 ACPI Exception (acpi_thermal-0412): AE_NOT_FOUND, Invalid active threshold [0] [20060707]
Followed by:
 ACPI: Thermal Zone [THRM] (47 C)
And looking in /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/cooling_mode, I see:
<setting not supported>
cooling mode:   passive
The fan seems to run at low speed even when CPU temp is stable at 37C,
and speeds up when it gets warmer, so there seems to be no overheating
problem (highest temp seen under full load is 60C.)
Is this normal?
