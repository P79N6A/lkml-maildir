OK, but I wasn't talking about overriding. In fact, I was taking it as
read that the devfs-type solution can't override (which it sort of
COULD, but as you say it has races) but would instead have its userspace
daemon create nodes _in addition to_ the kernel created ones, based on
user policy. Or symlinks, whatever the user space daemon wants.

Agreed.

Yes, agreed. If anything, that was one of the points I was trying to
make, that udev/sysfs is similar in concept to devfsd with devfs mounted
somewhere other than /dev (please nobody tell me how sysfs and devfs are
different, I know. I meant for the purposes of the udev/devfs user space
programs, they're fulfiling the same purpose. Getting a major and minor
from the kernel to the userspace daemon by creating a file on a
kernel-generated filesystem.)
What I would like to see is a kernel generated /dev with
kernel-specified paths. A userspace daemon, whether you call it udev or
devfsd, would then manage alternate (in addition to, not instead of)
naming schemes according to the sysadmin's whim and permissions of
device nodes and other things that just don't make sense to do in kernel
space.
