The commit comments for the Chelsio driver fix are a bit unfortunate.
The array clearly _does_ have three elements, it's just that the code used 
to access the fourth (that didn't exist), and now it accesses the third.
So when the commit says "The array should contain 2 elements" it's just 
being really confused.
Of course, using an array index of "cmdQ_restarted[2]" without any 
explanation for why it's index 2, the bug was inevitable. Maybe a symbolic 
value for the magic array indices?
