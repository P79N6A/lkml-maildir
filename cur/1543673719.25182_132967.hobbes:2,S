That's a good idea, and that's the way we did this (we added MSI support on top of the vector-based indexing). If people are interested in the vector-based indexing (i.e. provide the vector number to device drivers (non-legacy drivers only) instead of IRQ) for some other uses, we would like to discuss possible cleaner implementations.
Long will post a patch containing the vector-based indexing part only. 
Thanks,
Jun
