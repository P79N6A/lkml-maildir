I've been using Red Hat 5.2 for some time now with the 2.0.36 kernel. 
Also, I use KDE for my window manager under X.  Under X, I run a program
known as imwheel which intercepts mouse input and allows the user to
define key actions in place of button presses.  The main advantage of
this is to allow the wheel on a mouse to be used for scrolling.  The
wheel becomes buttons 4 and 5 (which is actually defined in the
XF86Config file), and imwheel intercepts those button presses and
instead sends key presses (the up and down arrow keys, for example) to
the current window instead.
Recently, I downloaded and compiled the kernel version 2.2.6.  The
compile went fine and the kernel booted with no serious problems. 
However, the imwheel no longer works.  Looking at the ouput of
/dev/mouse (which points to the PS/2 port), it seems the device never
even sees the wheel motion.  Is there something I need to set in the
kernel or is there something else no configured correctly?
Also, on a side note, the KDE program kpm, a process manager, now
insists on crashing with a segmentation fault under 2.2.6.
Any help is appreciated.  Thanks.
