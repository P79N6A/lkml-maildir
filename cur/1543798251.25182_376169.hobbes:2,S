I also have a dmesg with those options that I can upload, but I'm not
completely sure about the validity of the sluggishness "tests" because
the system felt the same after I booted with the different
configurations this time around.  ssh seems fine right now, so I guess
my Internet just happened to go bad at the same time I started play with
my hardware and kernel configurations.
I think the only solid problem I've got here is the tsc ocassionally
counting back.  Is switching to clock=pmtmr the permanent/proper
solution for this, or is there a bug in the kernel/hardware that should
be fixable?  Thanks.
Adrian
