Whoa Jeff.  You have really underlined your lack of
professionalism and lack of understanding of the breadth of
Linux, and UNIX in general here.
Linux was originally a PC operating system, and is mostly used on
PC based systems using x86 processors, however it is NOT the ONLY
platform on which Linux is used.  A perusal of the arch directory
easily shows the numerous platforms on which Linux runs.
Breaking backwards compatibility with old equipment for no real
good reason is not in the style of Linux.  I personally have no
need for 7bit terminals, and am not likely to ever have, however
I know that others out there in fact do have a use for them, and
likely will for some time now.
I thought that *I* was an adamant gun blazing loudmouth from time
to time, but my hat goes off to you - no contest.
