Hello,
with 2.6.2 and earlier I get sooner or later a sudden soft reset when I
use my graphic card with games or for example using uae (the amiga
emulator).
It takes different time until the hard reset happens, but with 
mtrr/agpgart/DRI switched on it definitely happens.
And sometimes I see this:
mtrr: base(0xdc000000) is not aligned on a size(0x1800000) boundary
or this:
mtrr: 0xdc000000,0x2000000 overlaps existing 0xdd000000,0x800000
Peaceful gaming with 2.4.x or 2.6.x with mtrr switched off.

I do not know how to get more information, there is no output on serial,
it just reboots suddenly.
