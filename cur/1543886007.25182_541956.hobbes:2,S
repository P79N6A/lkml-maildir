Hallo (Ingo),
testing something regarding linuxpps I want to do it against the "latest 
and greatest kernel ever" too.
rt-preempt is common from audio already.
CFS something new and promising.
But the patches conflict in their combination.
Is there something against this type of combination?
Is there perhaps a solution?
TIA
Bernhard
PS: ck's SD-patch conflicts too...
