2.2.0-pre7 seems to have problems compiling:
make xconfig fails:
[root@wilma linux]# make xconfig
rm -f include/asm
( cd include ; ln -sf asm-i386 asm)
make -C scripts kconfig.tk
make[1]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-2.2.0-pre7/scripts'
cat header.tk >> ./kconfig.tk
./tkparse < ../arch/i386/config.in >> kconfig.tk
make[1]: *** [kconfig.tk] Error 139
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.2.0-pre7/scripts'
make: *** [xconfig] Error 2
I used make menuconfig which seems to work OK.
Tony
btw. I have to make menuconfig in an xterm because RH5.2 has stuffed the
console font.  Can someone
tell me how to set it back to default?
