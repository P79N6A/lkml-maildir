Bryan,
I'd suggest you to test your NAND driver with the following NAND tests:
git://git.infradead.org/~ahunter/nand-tests.git
(
http://git.infradead.org/?p=users/ahunter/nand-tests.git;a=summary
)
You may want to avoid the torture test, but it is useful to run it with
limited amount of erase cycles to make sure your flash/driver survives
really high I/O load.For example, we caught occasional DMA transfer
problems while running the torture test for few days.
