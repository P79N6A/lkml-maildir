Hi,
This may or may not be useful but I've got sets of the "Linux
Developer's Resource" multi-CD sets put out by InfoMagic.  The earliest
one I have is March 1995 (which is a 4-CD set).  These include:
(according to the back of the box)
  - Complete Linux archives from tsx-11.mit.edu and sunsite.unc.edu
  - Complete GNU archive from prep.ai.mit.edu
  - Debian 0.91/3
  among other things including kernel sources (up to 1.2.1) etc.
The dates on some of the files in the tsx-11 archive go back to 1992.
If anyone is interested I can provide more information and extracts from
the archives.
Cheers,
Bernt.
