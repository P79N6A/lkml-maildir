Hi,
I'm totally confuzed by this patch ...

Are you sure you saw this crash on 22-git2 (Linus' tree) ???

Please post the full dmesg output, if possible.

Yup, but note that the "table" there is a struct ctl_table * ...

Whereas the "not null-terminated" array you're talking about
in devinet.c is a struct devinet_sysctl_table, whose *members*
are ctl_table structs.
Also note that all those members have already been declared
as arrays: struct ctl_table xxx[2]; *precisely* because the
second element (which is left un-initialized, hence will get
zeroed-out being static) is what will protect us from running
out into garbage in sysctl_set_parent().

Now I'm even more confuzed ...

You can always safely assume that.
Off-topic, but note that unintialized static variables being automagically
initialized to zero / NULL is guaranteed by C (the language) itself, so
nothing left in the hands of compiler implementations here. [6.7.8:10]

But that's pointless. It was already [2] for the reason I mentioned.

Weirder. diffstat does not match the patch ...

And Linus' latest -git doesn't even have this stuff at line 1493.

Well, as I said, I'm totally confuzed ...
