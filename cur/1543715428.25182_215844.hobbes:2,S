why to open transaction for ->prepare_write()? as for me, it doesn't
touch metadata to be stored on a disk.
I've partial implemented following idea:
->prepare_write() recognizes are blocks being written holes or reserved.
  it they are holes and haven't reserved yet, then set a flag about this.
  note that ->prepare_write() doesn't look right place to put reservation
  in because copy_from_user() in generic_file_aio_write_nolock() may fail.
->commit_write() looks at that flag and if it's set tries to reserve blocks.
  if reservation fails then ->commit_write() returns -ENOSPC, ext3_file_write()
  recognizes this, requests flushing and wait for free space.
->invalidatepage() drops reservation if space for page still non-allocated
->writepages() and ->writepage() drop reservation upon real allocation
I expect data=ordered mode to be very simple to implement: just put bio
submited in ->writepages() on list for correspondend transaction and
wait for completion of bio's in commit_transaction().
does this all make sense?
thanks, Alex
