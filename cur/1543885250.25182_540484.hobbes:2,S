Thanks to all the people who replied and sent some suggestions!
Due to the "scathing" (well, thorough ;) code review I'll send a patch
with those cleanups against 2.6.21-mm1 very soon.
(I was actually a bit surprised to see akpm commit this thing after this
review mail, but it's ok since it lets people experiment with it).
Thanks!
