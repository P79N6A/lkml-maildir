Mounting Solaris cachefs is very different. Their syntax is of the form:
mount -F cachefs [    generic_options     ] -o backfstype=file_system_type   [  specific_options  ]  [ -O ] special mount_point
So an example given on their manpage is as follows:
------
     The  following  example  CacheFS-mounts  the   file   system
     server1:/user2,  which is already NFS-mounted on /usr/abc as
     /xyz.
      example# mount -F cachefs -o backfstype=nfs,backpath=/usr/abc,
          cachedir=/cache1 server1:/user2 /xyz
------
Cheers,
  Trond
