"Doctor, it hurts when I..."
"Well, if it hurts, then don't..."
Honestly, I don't know of any *NIX that handles a case like
this entirely gracefully - you've got information on the
current directory and probably the inodes and files in
that directory cached in memory, then you do something
that completely invalidates what the cache says...
Arguably, the kernel maybe should flush any cached information
for all files/directories under a mount point before the
mount is accomplished, but that doesn't even resolve
the whole issue - you've still got the current directory
"open". I think the best option is probably for mount
to **not** succeed if the mount point directory or
any subdirectories or files are open. Probably fairly
expensive to determine, though...
