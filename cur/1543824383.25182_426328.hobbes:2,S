What about initialization, mode and context switching? From the
discussion I thought that people would like to see X server and
framebuffer console could coexist in a more coordinated way, which
could be coordinated DRI in kernel.
Agreed that kernel should only deal with necessary tasks as minimum as
possible. 2D/3D engine in user mode and the reorg of Xserver/APIs
around the engine is the thing people are discussing.
Designing the interface inevitably involves clear understanding of the
hardware capabilities and closed hardware spec is an obvious obstacle.
Open Graphics card (when becoming available) would be a great thing
and I wish a great X run it to its full strength.
It's a little offtopic for this list but, it's an interface between
kernel and user mode so both the Xorg and this mailing list would see
a lot discussion on it. I am glad to see such discussion is happening.
Of course a lot of education is needed for me to discuss such, with
the wish that a better X / GUI running on modern graphics hardware is
desirable for everyone.
