Why would anybody expect C code to catch exceptions? Define
an unexpected_handler, then:
extern "C" int sys_func() // user context
throw()
try {
	//do things
	return 0;
}
catch( std::bad_alloc e)
{
	return -ENOMEM;
}
catch( etc)
{
	return -ETCETERA;
}

Been there, done that, got the hairshirt. ;-)
The patch was huge (730k) and nearly all trivial. Takes more
than an hour if you're careful about not changing language
in comments.
The resulting kernel ran just fine.

Yup. C99 'inline' is going to break things. Storage class
modifiers are plain out. They should continue to work for
gcc keyword __inline__.
