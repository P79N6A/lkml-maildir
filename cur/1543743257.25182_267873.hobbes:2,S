    Yes, you will receive 'ECHILD', I didn't remember that, sorry.
Anyway, you shouldn't need to do that, since those zombies should
have been reparented to 'init'.
    But, since SUSv3 doesn't specify which PID should be the parent
when doing the reparenting, PID 0 could be used when reparenting as a
way of telling the kernel "hey, rip those processes". Anyway, since
the kernel does the reparenting, the kernel could get rid of zombies.
I don't really know why is 'init' (PID 1) responsible of this.
