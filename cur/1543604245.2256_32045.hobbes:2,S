How often does the linux kernel need to go through the PCI device
list ? Looking at only SCSI code, it seems that not very often.
If that is the case in general, optimizing it for lockless
lookup (assuming that you use RCU or something to support deletion),
is probably an overkill.
One example of where it is useful is maintenance of route information
in either storage or network. Route information changes infrequently but
needs to be looked up for every I/O and being able to do lockless
lookup here is a good gain.
Thanks
