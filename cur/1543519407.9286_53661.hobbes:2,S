True this driver aims at higher hardware but:

This is very true. One of the reason why I like to see the linux-SGI
graphics driver updated and also ported to other platforms. Most of todays
cards are junk but very soon they will not be. Then we will not need
userland locking. In fact nvidia cards can handle now what you described
earlier. The higher end professional card like Oxygen 3D used to thousands
of dollars. Now you can get one for > $700. This might seem like alot but
it really not when you compare to the $350 video cards out their now. Also
you can get SGI Visual Workstations for $3000. Considering what they thats
not a bad price. The day of bad hardware will soon come to a end :)

Yes they are. Last I heard SGI was planning to use Nvidia cards in their
future system. Thats way they shipped several SGI engineers over to 
Nvidia. To improve their hardware.
