Subject: [PATCH 2.5.41] trap in __release_resource

Russell,
I was getting a NULL pointer dereference in __release_resource when I tried
to boot 2.5.41.  I traced it down to your recent patch to 8250.c.  Since
the call to serial8250_request_std_resource() is now conditional, the call
to release_resource() needs to be conditional as well.  This patch fixes
the problem.  It looks obviously correct to me, but I don't know this code
at all.
Thanks,
Shaggy
