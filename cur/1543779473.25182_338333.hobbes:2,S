well if it's somewhat larger than a trivial fix then it would definitely 
be useful to always Cc: lkml. Trivial fixes can go to lkml too, just in 
case i dont upload fast enough and someone else wants the fix too.  
Generally, Cc:-ing the mailing list also puts less of a burden on me, 
because others might find flaws in patches i dont spot right away.
