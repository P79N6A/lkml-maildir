Subject: [PATCH] Make Andrew's life easier

Andrew recently complained that feature-removal-schedule.txt is always
generating conflicts.  The reason is clear; everybody adds to the
bottom of the file.  The solution he proposed is to place entries at
random places in the file.  However, we can make the tools work for
us here quite simply by adding a separator at the bottom of the file.
Then diff produces a patch which contains no meaningful context and
patch will happily put new entries into the file in a random order.
Unfortunately, git-cherry-pick won't, but I don't think Andrew uses it,
so he'll be happy anyway.
This will fail if people subsequently fail to add a separator at the
bottom of a file.  But then those people can be legitimately grumped at.
