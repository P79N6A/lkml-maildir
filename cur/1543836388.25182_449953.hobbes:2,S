Yes, it's part hardware, part software, a pseudo firmwarish mesh of the 
two.  When you've got multiple vendors involved, you need to paint the 
interface with a broader stroke so that the individual details of each 
don't get so involved, and you can do that in many different ways.  You 
still need an ABI, not just an API, though, for future compatibility of 
existing kernels, which is important to mainframe customers for 
migration as well as virtual machine users.
But I think we're running off into the weeds picking nits here..
