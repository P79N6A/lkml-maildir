Subject: CONFIG_NETLINK_DEV - bad or just misunderstood?

This has been bugging for me a long, long time.  The help text for
CONFIG_NETLINK_DEV says:
  "This is a backward compatibility option, choose Y for now.
   This option will be removed soon."
Okay, but it's said this throughout the 2.2.x series, and it's still there
in the latest development kernel.  What's the story here?  What exactly
does "netlink device emulation" get us?
Enquiring minds want to know,
