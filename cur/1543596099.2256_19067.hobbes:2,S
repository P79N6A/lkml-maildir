At the Partition Check stage, I start getting "hde: lost interrupt"
messages.  /dev/hde is an IBM DTLA-307030, sitting on an HPT370
controller (motherboard is KA7-100).  Eventually the partitions appear
in the list, interspersed with these lost interrupt messages, but very
slowly.  Then there was a burst of activity until the "Activating swap
partition" step, at which point the machine stopped responding.  The
swap partition is /dev/hde5.
Just compiled 2.4.5-ac22 for comparison and that works fine.
