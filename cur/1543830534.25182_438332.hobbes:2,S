cdrtools-2.01a33 is extremely old (2 years).
It did not introduce new SCSI commands (compared to prevuious versions) and I
would be interested why this problem is discussed late.
The only new thing with cdrecord-2.01a33 is that it started to transfer more 
than 4 bytes with the "read buffer" command. As this is only issued in case that
the "read buffer" command did succeed with 4 bytes transfer count and as 
cdrecord does not transfer more than the drive advertizes, I am just depending 
on a kernel that does not freeze from the SCSI command I am issuing.
