  Folks,  first of all,  DO NOT TOP POST!
You are attempting to violate causality.  (At least it looks like such.)
One thing to realize in UNIX filesystems is that they are OPTIMIZED
for finding files (with huge majority - 3 to 5 nines worth).
That means there are many cute caches to help lookups. 
Cases where directory contents are modified (e.g. creat/rename/unlink)
are considered extremely rare, and there the only really interesting
thing is correctness.
In some very odd cases a lot more files are created / destroyed in
a system, than is average - such applications include: Squid and INN.
For INN this particular detail has been known to be a bottle neck, and
thus was born Cyclic News Filesystem - a way to use pre-allocated big
files as storage space for news items.

I should think that 300 IOPS is a lot from single PC hard-drive.
Indeed they usually can't go that fast.
Again, that is where all these marvellous caches come to play.
