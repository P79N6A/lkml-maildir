You just need to take a look on Windows driver. If there are HUGE .vxd
(or .386) file then it's winmodem for sure. If not, then may be it's not
a winmodem.

Hmm... Interesting...

This is real easy novadays :-/ In quite a few times this not written clearly
enough...

No, I'm not so sure. It's almost surely winmodem but there are exist small
chance that it's not a winmodem...
Why [almost] all PCI modems are winmodems? Well... PCI has VERY complex
protocol... so you'll need custom-made chip to handle it... and thus you
need HUGE number of selled modems to be profitable... and since for most
users winmodem is enough and it's cheaper then real modem better to create
winmodem and not real one... so almost all PCI modems are winmodems (even
if it's not stated explicitly) but I hear rumours that there are exists
real PCI modems and if you are lucky may be yours is not winmodem ...
Chance is small hovever...
