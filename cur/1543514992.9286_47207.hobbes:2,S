It _seems_ like IBM has released a patch too, now, at least they released
a patch concerning their NFS-server some days ago, without any description
what-so-ever. Possibly this could be our long awaited bug... I haven't
tested it yet, though, so I'm not sure...
bos.net.nfs.client.4.3.2.10                                os 675840
Try it out and report success/failure here... And please, CC me.

Patches are available for virtually all versions of SunOS, except for one,
where a test-patch is available...
