Can this be re-worked to ensure that it clears the target directory
the *first* time?  It would suck mightily if a previous build of 2.6.17-rc2
left a net_foo.ko lying around to get insmod'ed by accident (consider the case
of CONFIG_NETFOO=m getting changed to y or n, and other possible horkage.
Module versioning will catch some, but not all, of this crap....)
