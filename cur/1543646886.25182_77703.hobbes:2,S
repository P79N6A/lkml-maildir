Subject: vpath broken in 2.5.41

I see vpath seems to have become broken in 2.5.41 build.
How now can I build the oprofile.o target from two directories ?
Namely,
	arch/i386/oprofile/Makefile:
vpath %.c = . $(TOPDIR)/drivers/oprofile
obj-$(CONFIG_OPROFILE) += oprofile.o
DRIVER_OBJS = \
        oprof.o cpu_buffer.o buffer_sync.o \
        event_buffer.o oprofile_files.o \
        oprofilefs.o oprofile_stats.o
oprofile-objs := $(DRIVER_OBJS) init.o timer_int.o
ifdef CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC
oprofile-objs += nmi_int.o op_model_athlon.o op_model_ppro.o
endif
include $(TOPDIR)/Rules.make
with the DRIVER_OBJS sources in drivers/oprofile/
Since this was intentional, I assume I have to move my arch-dependent
parts back into drivers/ Kai ?
thanks
john
