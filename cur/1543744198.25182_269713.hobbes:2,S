Yes, I would like that, too, but futexes are 2.6 only, and probably also 
NPTL-only (we are going to fix that, at least for SKAS mode), but faster than 
anything else. Nothing apart this.

Ok. But to get TT mode to work against NPTL glibc, which is required for 
futexes, we need to recode the "thread_private" section in uml.lds.S to work 
with NPTL glibc. It seems that binutils does not like that (the error is "not 
enough program header allocated", which refers to the fact that 
SIZEOF_HEADERS is guessed and then used. Not using SIZEOF_HEADERS could help, 
if doing this is possible).

There are two down() and two up(); additionally, run_helper_thread() manages 
at least another pipe(). I don't see an easy way to simplifying all this, but 
it's needed (or at least some comment should be added). Just a cleanup, 
anyway.
