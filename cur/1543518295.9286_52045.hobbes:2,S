well, while trying to get it to work i've often wondered what the
person who came up with the sysenter/sysexit scheme at intel had been 
sniffing... [for people who might not be familiar with sysenter:
passing of eip/esp is necessary because sysenter doesn't save it, this is
true always, even with Linus' scheme; the only choice we have is _how_
to do that, and there's no perfect solution]

the choice becomes: do you want the libc to do this (presumably just one
test on bootup which selects the proper stubs to use) or do you want the
kernel to do very much the same (by providing the stubs (or as you
suggested some kind of intermidiate single C entry point, which isn't a
good solution either).

I did consider this. The reasons i didn't do it that way were (1) to
make it as nonitrusive as possible (the patch currently is just a few
dozen lines) and (2) policy -- adding hardwired userspace mappings.
(the performance difference would be ~ a few cycles, so that's not a
big issue). Now, if (1) isn't a problem i may consider that scheme again.
Assuming nobody sees any problems w/ (2) above?

Until now i've actually ignored all 5 arg syscalls, as the int80
entry point is always there and the gain is smaller the more the
complex the syscall is; so i didn't have to do even that. But i had
planned on changing that -- this is one reason i said the numbers
given above are going to change a bit.

Yep. In theory this seems perfect. Other people have already pointed out some
obvious issues, there are probably more; most are likely solvable, but could
add significantly to the complexity. [there are some less obvious issues like
you can not, for various reasons, blindly use the sysenter/sysexit pair
(eg you can not return with sysexit from execve) and in some cases i found
int80 to be faster (eg signal handling, when restarting syscalls)]

This has been true for quite a while, having an optimized libc for 
your architecture makes sense. If you need to share libraries you
just pick the least common demoninator (and pay the price in performance,
but in reality that's usually very low).
Not that i think that this is relevant in this case -- the question is:
is there anything that the kernel can do that could not be done equally
well in libc? Why shouldn't libc be setting up that special magic entry
point all by itself?
[i'm obviously a bit biased since i already have sysenter working w/o
the kernel mapped stubs, but wouldn't have a problem switching to 
another solution, if i'd be convinced it would be beneficial. 
SYSENTER/EXIT has it's problems, but the numbers speak for themselfes.
A few examples:
      	             INT80      SYSENTER
lat_syscall null     0.6814      0.3394
lat_syscall read     1.0477      0.6747
lat_syscall write    0.8422      0.4937
lat_fifo             7.4193   	 6.3050
lat_pipe             7.4369   	 6.3880
lat_unix             14.9843     14.1488
time dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null bs=1 count=10000000
      	             0:20.21  	 0:13.00
