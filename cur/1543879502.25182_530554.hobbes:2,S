OK, I fixed that up.
The next patch (make-kthread_stop-scalable) removes the find_task_by_pid()
anyway.
Our kthread creation performance will be pretty poor anyway, due to the
need to do two (or more?) context switches.  If we ever need
super-low-latency kernel thread creation (eg, on-demand threads for AIO)
then that code would need to go direct to kernel_thread(), I guess.
