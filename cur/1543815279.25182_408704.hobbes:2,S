Pavel, you keep doing the same basic mistake...
Understand your client!
Suspend is a feature that is most used by the mobile community.
Disk encryption is also common for most of this community.
Putting them to work together should be your interest...
Calling your clients stupid is not wise!

Well... Good thinking... But how do you plan to encrypt the
swap? There are about 1000 ways to do this...
Jari Ruusu had written the loop-aes which was not merged...
From a similar reason suspend2 was rejected by you.
I hope you don't think that file-system encryption should be
implemented in user mode too...
The dm-crypt is weak... So we left with specific encryption
implementation of swsusp... And now you offer a specific
encryption for swap as well... Why not realize that there
should be one encryption solution for block devices in kernel?
As a result of this mess the mobile community uses external
solutions.
