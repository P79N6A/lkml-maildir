Doh! I see my mistake; I was reading pdev_enable_device() which sets it
to L1_CACHE_BYTES. And a quick grep shows me that it is called from
pci_assign_unassigned_resources(), which is not called on ia32 as far as
I can see....
This seems to be a common thing to set; shouldn't we have a helper for
it as well, or have pci_enable_device() do it?
Thanks,
