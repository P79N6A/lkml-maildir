It's only real issue for something like execshield.  For this it's easy
to do the fixed math since it's still at fixed address.
+       DEFINE(VSYSCALL_BASE, (PAGE_OFFSET - 2*PAGE_SIZE));
But execshield has to make SYSENTER_RETURN context sensitive to current
since the vdso is mapped at random location.
