Hello everyone,
I am looking for a crypto hardware accelerator which is available in the
EU in form of a PCI card which is supported by the linux kernel to do a
device mapper crypt setup using aes256. It would be also nice if it
could also be used by openssl userland applications. Also I would like
to know if there are some plans to support IDE drives which do AES
transparently for the OS. Like an ATA Command which tells the drive
which AES key to use during startup. An the rest does the device instead
of the hostos/cpu.
