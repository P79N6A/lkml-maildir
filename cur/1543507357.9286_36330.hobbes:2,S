I really recommend NOT hinting at encryption by including a "rot13"
example.
As said before in this thread, HOOKS for encryption are munitions, and
cannot be exported.
A hook for rot13 is a hook for a (weak) encryption algorithm. That
leaves no room to argue "But we didn't intend for it to get used for
encryption. Just for an optional byte-swap".
