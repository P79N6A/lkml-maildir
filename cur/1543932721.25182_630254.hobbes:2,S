Subject: [PATCH -mm 01/43] user_regset header
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/20/72

The new header <linux/regset.h> defines the types struct user_regset and
struct user_regset_view, with some associated declarations.  This new set
of interfaces will become the standard way for arch code to expose
user-mode machine-specific state.  A single set of entry points into arch
code can do all the low-level work in one place to fill the needs of core
dumps, ptrace, and any other user-mode debugging facilities that might come
along in the future.
For existing arch code to adapt to the user_regset interfaces, each arch
can work from the code it already has to support core files and ptrace.
The formats you want for user_regset are the core file formats.  The only
wrinkle in adapting old ptrace implementation code as user_regset get and
set functions is that these functions can be called on current as well as
on another task_struct that is stopped and switched out as for ptrace.
For some kinds of machine state, you may have to load it directly from CPU
registers or otherwise differently for current than for another thread.
(Your core dump support already handles this in elf_core_copy_regs for
current and elf_core_copy_task_regs for other tasks, so just check there.)
The set function should also be made to work on current in case that
entails some special cases, though this was never required before for
ptrace.  Adding this flexibility covers the arch needs to open the door to
more sophisticated new debugging facilities that don't always need to
context-switch to do every little thing.
The copyin/copyout helper functions (in a later patch) relieve the arch
code of most of the cumbersome details of the flexible get/set interfaces.

+ * @bias:		Bias from natural indexing.
+ * @core_note_type:	ELF note @n_type value used in core dumps.
+ * @get:		Function to fetch values.

+ * @active:		Function to report if regset is active, or %NULL.
+ * @writeback:		Function to write data back to user memory, or %NULL.
+ *
+ * This data structure describes a machine resource we call a register set.
+ * This is part of the state of an individual thread, not necessarily
+ * actual CPU registers per se.  A register set consists of a number of
+ * similar slots, given by @n.  Each slot is @size bytes, and aligned to
+ * @align bytes (which is at least @size).
+ *
+ * These functions must be called only on the current thread or on a
+ * thread that is in %TASK_STOPPED or %TASK_TRACED state, that we are
+ * guaranteed will not be woken up and return to user mode, and that we
+ * have called wait_task_inactive() on.  (The target thread always might
+ * wake up for SIGKILL while these functions are working, in which case
+ * that thread's user_regset state might be scrambled.)
+ *
+ * The @pos argument must be aligned according to @align; the @count
+ * argument must be a multiple of @size.  These functions are not
+ * responsible for checking for invalid arguments.
+ *
+ * When there is a natural value to use as an index, @bias gives the
+ * difference between the natural index and the slot index for the
+ * register set.  For example, x86 GDT segment descriptors form a regset;
+ * the segment selector produces a natural index, but only a subset of
+ * that index space is available as a regset (the TLS slots); subtracting
+ * @bias from a segment selector index value computes the regset slot.
+ *
+ * If nonzero, @core_note_type gives the n_type field (NT_* value)
+ * of the core file note in which this regset's data appears.
+ * NT_PRSTATUS is a special case in that the regset data starts at
+ * offsetof(struct elf_prstatus, pr_reg) into the note data; that is
+ * part of the per-machine ELF formats userland knows about.  In
+ * other cases, the core file note contains exactly the whole regset
+ * (@n * @size) and nothing else.  The core file note is normally
+ * omitted when there is an @active function and it returns zero.
