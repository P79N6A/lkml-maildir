I love this idea. Everything in one neat, drop-in package.
1. As person working for a hardware vendor, this would make
things much easier for me and my customers.
2. I think it would also make it easier to move things
around when restructuring the source directories is necessary.
3. And it might reduce the instances of a driver accidentally
being removed when a Makefile is reworked (which just happened
to a driver of ours in the 2.4.0-test kernels).
This may not be appropriate for all add-ons, but for simple drivers
like ours this would be great.
Maybe even add another tag to add the config help text.
This has my vote of support.
