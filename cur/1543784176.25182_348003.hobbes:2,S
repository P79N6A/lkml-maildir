Yes, can be added.
enter_all_cpus_idle() and exit_all_cpus_idle() would be better?

Yes, this is what I said.

No, I was saying what you were, if a little unclearly, so the caller
does something like:
current_dyn_tick_timer->reprogram();
check_cpu_mask(nohz_cpu_mask);
if (we_are_last_idle)
  enter_all_cpus_idle();
