well - what did you expect to happen? A freed page is going to be reused
for other purposes. A big 2MB allocation can be reused in part, once
memory usage grows. So you should not expect the device to be able to DMA
into a page that got freed, unpunished. Perhaps i'm misunderstanding the
problem.

the buddy allocator allocates top down. Plus, if you allocate a 2MB
physically continuous chunk then the likelyhood is high that there were
fragmented pages skipped during the initial search for a 2MB block - so
you still have a fair likelyhood to reallocate it after some time, if
memory usage is light. But this likelyhood nears zero once RAM usage gets
near 100%.
