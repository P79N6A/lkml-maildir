"integration procedure" is hardly an accurate description, rather it
is a development procedure that was developed after discussion and
consensus building across LKML and the ext2/3/4 development team.  It
was not the original plan put forth by the ext2 developers, but after
listening to the concerns and suggestions, we did not question the
motives of the people making suggestions; we listened.

Actually, the first bits that we plan to merge have already been
written and in use by hundreds of clusterfs customers, posted to LKML
for comments (and we don't attack our reviewers, we thank them for
their comments), and in fact they were written about at last year's
OLS complete with benchmarks and graphs.

I believe you are referring to Jim Mostek and Steve Lord, and yes,
they were very talented developers and engineers.  I very much enjoyed
talking to them at various filesystem and Linux conferences and
workshops.

That's hardly what happened.  SGI went through layoffs, and they were
hit.  See:

You do realize these two statements are completely contradictory,
don't you?  If an experimental filesystem can be dropped at any time,
then Linspire can't depend on it from the point of view of supporting
their users.  If there is a huge user base, then someone is going to
have to maintain it, even if the developer community has moved on to
supporting the next new exciting filesystem thing.  Hence, it is
critical that the resulting filesystem be fully maintainable before it
is integrated.  To put it in your words, it wouldn't be responsible to
the user base to do otherwise.
