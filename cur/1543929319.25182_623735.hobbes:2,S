Repository overview.
	CGIT: 
http://cgit.freedesktop.org/
	GITWEB: 
http://git.kernel.org/
	Remarks:
	cgit is lacking the links "shortlog", "log", "tree" and "git"
	which gitweb prints for each repository line.
Inside a repository.
	CGIT: 
http://cgit.freedesktop.org/hal/
	GITWEB:	
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=summary
	Remarks:
	In cgit, the left gray panel went by quite unnoticed, possibly as an
	unintended reaction to the omnipresent ad positions in Internet
	websites, or because it is "just" the menu. Compare with the GNU
	Savannah site, which also has the menu on the left side, which I
	also used quite rarely (only to login), everything else happens in
	the white pane.
Clicking on a commit.
	CGIT: 
http://cgit.freedesktop.org/hal/commit/?id=b8f72cec53415ebc2d32805b049dcc94cef4a854
	GITWEB: 
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/misc-2.6.git;a=commit;h=8c27eba54970c6ebbb408186e5baa2274435e869
	Remarks:
	cgit comes with a diffstat. Not that I look at diffstats all that
	often anyway. Still need to click on "(diff)" go get a diff.
	Filenames are displayed with monospace font in gitweb :)
	Clicking on the commit actually shows its diff in gitweb.
Final remark:
	gitweb has the warmer colors.
