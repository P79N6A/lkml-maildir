Ok, great. 
Do you actually wait for busy to go away before sending the
execute diag command ? Or do you just blast it to the device
right when entering the probe code ?
I'm concerned that if you don't wait for busy to go away, you
end up interrupting the drive reset process with execute diag.
which may not be the best thing to do...
Anyway, if you have a patch ready, pls share so I can get
that tested by the various users of those problematic
setups !
Thanks,
Ben.
