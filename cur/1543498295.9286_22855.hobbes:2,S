Err, no.  First, you assume that the Linux cache can be arbitrarily large
(or at least that enough memory is available to cache reasonable working
sets); second, cachefs is persistent across reboots, which the Linux buffer
cache cannot be.
There's also the fact that AFS, DFS, and Coda all have a cachefs-equivalent
built into them:  reads and writes are redirected to the local vice cache,
which is synced on close.  This isn't merely because it's somehow easier than 
using the OS buffer cache.

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
