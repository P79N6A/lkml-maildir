I just found a message from Linus that says:
  The other change is that I forward-ported the ymfpci driver from 2.2.18,
  as it works better than the ALSA one on my now-to-be-main-laptop ;) 
(in 
http://boudicca.tux.org/hypermail/linux-kernel/2000week50/0200.html
)
Now I know why error messages looked so familiar. :)
In other words, Jaroslav was not involved.
I'll see what Linus did and send him updates, if any.

I'll try to understand what this is all about. Honestly,
I do not know how OPL3 works and who uses it (it's a MIDI
thing, isn't it?)
