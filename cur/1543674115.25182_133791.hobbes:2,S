Two comments on firmware_class_hotplug(), maybe both are irrelevant.
+int firmware_class_hotplug(struct class_device *class_dev, char **envp,
+			   int num_envp, char *buffer, int buffer_size)
+{
+	struct firmware_priv *fw_priv = class_get_devdata(class_dev);
+	int i=0;
+	char *scratch=buffer;
+
+	if (buffer_size < (FIRMWARE_NAME_MAX+10))
+		return -ENOMEM;
+
+	envp [i++] = scratch;
+	scratch += sprintf(scratch, "FIRMWARE=%s", fw_priv->fw_id) + 1;
+	return 0;
+}
+
First, I do not understand how the environment is handled here.  You're
just setting first element of provided environment to "FIRMWARE=%s",
possibly overwriting the existing value.  Then why are you incrementing
`i'?  Why are you using `i' at all?  Why are you incrementing `scratch'?
Ah, it seems like you should be using num_envp somehow, and you're not.
Also, environment pointer list must be terminated with a NULL pointer. Is
it not done or is that handled somewhere else?  The machine I have 2.5.69
sources is not reachable now so I cannot check it.  Sorry if I am wrong.
