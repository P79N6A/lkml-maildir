That seems to address the issue. It allows use of all CPUs  in the most
common case that they all are in and working at boot.

My impression is that a fair number of users don't add CPUs anyway, they
swap problem parts if runtime diagnostics indicate a failing
{fan,VRM,other}.

Since this would be init code the size is not an issue. I guess a
boot-time option would be desirable in case a site wants to boot with
fewer processors than are physically present (like mem=) for some reason
like benchmarking.
