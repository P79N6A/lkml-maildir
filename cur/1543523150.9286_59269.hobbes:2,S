When I try to compile anything other then the kernel, I get this:
In file included from /usr/include/linux/signal.h:5,

With 2.3.39 I couldn't even compile the kernel. Everything works fine with
2.3.38.
btw: I'm using libc5, but it probably has little to do with it.
I'm not on the list, so please CC me.
