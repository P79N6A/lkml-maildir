Speaking of performance.... :)
Has anyone done any testing on a dual CPU configuration like this?  I've
been testing this box with both the RedHat 8 Stock Kernel (2.4.18.something)
and 2.4.19 from kernel.org.  Currently, I can't make the thing perform
anywhere near as fast as my Dual PIII 1 Ghz box (running 2.4.7 for the last
325 days...) .  I've been compiling the same block of code on both the
machines and comparing the times.  The PIII box is around 7 s, while the new
Xeon Box is 13 or 14s...
My thinking was that since the CPUs are much faster, and the FSB is faster,
and the disk controller is faster, that the computer would be faster.
The hardware is obviously faster, I'm sure its just something I've done
wrong in the kernel configuration...  If anyone has any advice or words of
wisdom, I'd really appreciate them...
Thanks in advance,
Mark
