Thanks for testing. Though, bad news are that it's still unclear
why your machine doesn't like large cardbus windows and therefore
how to fix that correctly.
May I ask you to do couple of another tests with following variations
of the latest patch (this will help to determine whether it's IO or
MEM ranges to blame)?
1. 
#define CARDBUS_IO_SIZE		(256)
#define CARDBUS_MEM_SIZE	(32*1024*1024)
2.
#define CARDBUS_IO_SIZE		(4096)
#define CARDBUS_MEM_SIZE	(4*1024*1024)
Ivan.
