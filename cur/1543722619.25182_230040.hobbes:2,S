Well, you know how it is: either you implement this yourself, or
you provide enough details to enable someone else to implement this.
For example, suppose you dd the first megabyte off your DVD,
and make it available somewhere, or compress and uuencode and email it,
that might help.

You might try to get more details by undefining BEQUIET (in isofs/inode.c).
You might try to give the mount option -o nojoliet.
