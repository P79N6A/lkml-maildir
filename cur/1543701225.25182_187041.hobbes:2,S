All I used to get was :
"Debug: sleeping function called from invalid context
at include/linux/rwsem.h:45
in_atomic: 0, irqs_disabled(): 1
Call Trace:"
That's it. Nothing more. Looks like it could not read the
stack at that point and hence couldn't dump the stack traceback.
I now inserted some printk's in do_page_fault
to print regs->eip before calling down_read i.e:
        /*
         * If we're in an interrupt, have no user context or are running in an
         * atomic region then we must not take the fault..
         */
        if (in_atomic() || !mm)
                goto bad_area_nosemaphore;
+       if (irqs_disabled()) {
+               printk("BAD Access at (EIP) %08lx\n", regs->eip);
+               printk("Bad Access at virtual address %08lx\n",address);
+       }
        down_read(&mm->mmap_sem);
This is what I got now when I reran my stress test:
BAD Access at (EIP) c011c1b5
Bad Access at virtual address 05050501
Debug: sleeping function called from invalid context at include/linux/rwsem.h:47
in_atomic():0, irqs_disabled():1

BAD Access at (EIP) c0139934
Bad Access at virtual address 0101011f
The first EIP (c011c1b5) is inside search_extable!!
The second EIP (c0139934) is inside get_ksymbol() ...
I suspect the second happened when kdb tried decoding the (first) exception
address and hence is secondary here ..
The stack trace that follows the first exception seems to be
totally bogus(?) .. I suspect the first exception 
happened in search_extable when looking up some module exception
tables(?) ..Because search_module_extables() calls search_extable() with 
interrupts disabled ..
I think this points to some module unload (race) issues during hotplug ..
Rusty, any comments?

Given the context above, I feel it would be correct for
do_page_fault() to avoid calling down_read() when IRQs are
disabled and instead just branch to bad_nosemaphore.
(as Rusty seems to concur) .. However, schedule() doesn't
seem to actually trap the case when it is called with interrupts disabled (as using local_irq_disable)?
