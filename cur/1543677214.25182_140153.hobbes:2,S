That's odd ... the instructions there look like they're
at the start of the "if (ed->state == ED_IDLE) ..."
clause, and "ed" happens to be null.  (They're an
exact match for that code from one of my builds, and
the "ed_get + 0x55/0x210" is a close location match.)
Now, I can't see how "ed" could be null there, but
then maybe I wouldn't.  Easier to believe the bug
might be elsewhere.  Does it this reproduce for you?
If you provide additional info, make sure it includes
the part of "objdump -dr ohci-hcd.o" with ed_get().
