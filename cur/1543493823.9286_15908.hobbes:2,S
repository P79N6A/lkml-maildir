The areas used for logging are written to often. On one running system,
each 2K log block is written to an average of 5.24 times. I believe logs
are generally flushed out immediately (via async I/O on OS's that support
it) because recoverability is so important.
Another stat on the same machine: At one snapshot, it had written to the
trans log 23 times per second and allocated a new block 4.5 times per
second. Logs are written sequentially and periodically truncated, so this
fits the earlier stat that you're going to get about 5 writes per 2K block
(on this DB).
I've generally found that the "busy-ness" of the DB I'm working on is
directly dependent on the number of trans log writes.

Does anybody have an idea of a good benchmark to run?
