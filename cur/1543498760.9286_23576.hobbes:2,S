It is a bug in egcs-1.1.* on little endian targets, that miscompiles partial
assignments to variables (e.g "int var =0xff00; *((char*)&var) = 0xff;" gives
0xff not 0xffff). This bug is triggered very seldom in normal programs, the
only one I know of, beside ping, is dhcpcd which uses the same in_chcksum
function.
I have a patch for egcs-1.1.2, that works well for my x86 Target, but may not
work for other architectures. In the new egcs-2.95 this bug should be fixed.
