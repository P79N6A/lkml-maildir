I have finally traced down the bug (Tatung webpad TWN-5213CU with SC3200 CPU):
- in apm_mainloop there is an for(;;) loop, which set a
scheduler_timeout (1second) and then calls apm_event_handler().
- apm_event_handler does some checks and calls check_events();
- check_events has a loop:
	while ((event = get_event()) != 0) { switch (event) {...} }
The module was "crashing" on my box because it keeps on receiving
events=APM_UPDATE_TIME meaning that it would never get out of the
while() loop in check_events. I need to do some tests but I might
simply fix this by ignoring APM_UPDATE_TIME events. I first thought
replacing the "while ((event = get_event()) != 0)" by an "if ((event =
get_event()) != 0)" but maybe I would miss other events doing this?
Best regards,
Nicolas.
PS: btw, thanks for your email that's really nice to answer every
message on this mailing list.
