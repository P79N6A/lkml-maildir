diz gave #kernel a good diatribe a few weeks ago about the headaches 
associated with using the PIT as a clock source, with one of the more 
interesting tidbits being that chipsets will pull the frequency higher 
and lower at times in order to implement spread spectrum to comply with 
RF emissions.  The RTC doesn't suffer from this, but it only provides 
HZ values which are powers of two.  How bad would 256 Hz be?
