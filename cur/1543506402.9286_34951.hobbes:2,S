Hi folks,
I discovered that doing "setserial -g" on my cyclades multiport com ports
will make my machine lock hard (without an OOPS or any traces in my log
files) on the *next* attempt to access that serial port.
This was hard to locate since the problem happens sometimes long after
the cause, but it's repeatable.
I'm using setserial-2.15, 2.2.9-ac6, RedHat 6.0 on i586. My Cyclades card
is an 8-port card (with the octopus cables coming off a SCSI-like connector)
and has been working perfectly for years. 
Is there a new setserial that I should be using?
On a related topic, I get these messages in my logs on startup:
Aug 19 13:37:21 satyr kernel: Use of setserial/setrocket to set SPD_* flags is deprecated 
These have to do with using "setserial" to set the spd_hi and spd_vhi flags
on the serial ports. If these flags are deprecated, how am I supposed to do 
the intended function (getting higher speeds from getty_ps, stty, etc)?
