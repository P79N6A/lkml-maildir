I think the mistake on VMS was that the defaults were horribly
low and where not changed when machines got more memory, there
may be some situations where an RSS limit is wanted, but
the kernel would need to be implementing it, the process has no
control over its RSS.
I can see even having a min RSS that a process won't get swapped
below being probably more useful, as certain interactive process
on either a server or a desktop might want to not be swapped out below
a certain level, even if other processes suffer.   I would suspect
that I would set a min limit on certain applications that needed
decent response, and had got previously bad response to because 
of swapping, though something in the kernel would need to deal
with a potential overcommitting of memory via this method, and 
deal with the associated deadlock.
