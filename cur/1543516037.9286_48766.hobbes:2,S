Hi, 
I have 10 servers with adaptec scsi controlers they all have AHA-2940U2W
except for one server which has AHA-2940W.  After upgrading to 2.3.x
kernels it works well on all the machines except on the one with AHA-2940W
card, I can't boot past sequencer code download. It just loops through the
download like crazy. I tested it with all kernels after 2.3.18 and no go.
I run 2.2.x kernels on that server currently and it works fine.  I noticed
that 2.2.x kernels use aic7xxx.c version 5.1.10 and 2.3.x kernels use
5.1.19 or 5.1.20.  
Is there a fix for this problem?  
Thanks
	Fil
P.S.
I use gcc 2.7.2.3  and ld version 2.9.1 (with BFD 2.9.1.0.4).
