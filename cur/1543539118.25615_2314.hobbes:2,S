Subject: Toshiba ToPIC100 support?

Can anybody comment on the level of support for the abovementioned CardBus
bridge?  I had tried an early 2.2.x kernel, but was never able to get my
Xircom CardBus Ethernet card to work (even with the latest pcmcia utils).
I cannot find any reference to "ToPIC100" in the 2.4.x source, so I am
curious what happened.
(BTW, the notebook in question is a Toshiba Satellite Pro 4260XDVD)
Much thanks,
Mike.
