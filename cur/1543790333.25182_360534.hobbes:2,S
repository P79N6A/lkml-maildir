Does it really matter?   I needed to pick one of
printed_message=1; or printed_message++;
the end result is the same, so I just picked one at random.
But now that you mention it, I guess ++ would turn into "inc" which
should be faster than an assignment... but it *doesn't matter*... I
was not trying to optimize anything, just make the code work properly
- as in, only ever print the message once...
