It's not a problem, it's standard-mandated behaviour.
From vsscanf(3):
       The following conversions are available:
...
       d      Matches  an  optionally signed decimal integer; the next pointer
              must be a pointer to int.
...
       i      Matches an optionally signed integer; the next pointer must be a
              pointer  to  int.   The  integer is read in base 16 if it begins
              with `0x' or `0X', in base 8 if it begins with `0', and in  base
              10  otherwise.   Only characters that correspond to the base are
              used.
IOW, %d _does_ mean base=10.  base=0 is %i.  That goes both for kernel and
userland implementations of scanf family (and for any standard-compliant
implementation, for that matter).
