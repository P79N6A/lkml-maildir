Hello,
I've got an A7N8X mobo, and the same problems. 'noapic' makes the
system run much better. You also have a big interrupt count on int21.
Mine is going beserk. Top shows that almost 30% of my cpu is being
used up on hi (Hardware Interrupts I guess).
Watching /proc/interrupts reveals I get tens of thousands of
interrupts on 21 every second, disabling usb or the soundcard doesn't
help, disabling both does help. Is interrupt 21 doing something funny?
Regards,
        justin....
