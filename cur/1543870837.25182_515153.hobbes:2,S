What on earth are you talking about?  Please, go and look at the thing.

Well, backup programs are a unique case.  Let's say instead that the user
has just generated a 600MB ISO image.
The kernel *just doesn't know* whether the user will next try to read the
kernel tree or will next try to read that ISO image.
That, Rik, is my point, and is the entire point of this work.

You can't, that's why I did this work.

The kernel knows the past, and tries to predict the future from that past. 
Sometimes, as you well know, that goes badly wrong.  That's why I did this
work.
