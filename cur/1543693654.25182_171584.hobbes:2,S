| +For small patches you may want to CC Trivial Patch Monkey 
| +trivial@rustcorp.com.au set up by Rusty Russell which collects "trivial" 
| +patches. Trivial patches must qualify for one of the following rules:
| + Spelling fixes in documentation
| + Spelling fixes which could break grep(1).
| + Warning fixes (cluttering with useless warnings is bad)
| + Compilation fixes (only if they are actually correct)
| + Runtime fixes (only if they actually fix things)
| + Removing use of deprecated functions/macros (eg. check_region).
| + Contact detail and documentation fixes
| + Non-portable code replaced by portable code (even in arch-specific, 
| + since people copy, as long as it's trivial)
| + Any fix by the author/maintainer of the file. (ie. patch monkey 
| + in re-transmission mode)
| +
Maybe add the Trivial Patch Monkey web page:
