I had an experience pretty close... but I never saw anything wrong with
man... I have ALWAYS LOVED man.... it's the perfect help system IMO, and
info is infuriating to me...  There should be a but more documentation some
places sure, but nothing is going to completely remedy that... because
you'll never get everybody to keep documentation updated correctly.

My first exposure to Unix came in 1987 when I was assigned to write a
datacomm
package in C on a Unix (AIX) workstation the company had just bought.  I was
the
only one in our shop who knew C, and no one else there had ever dealt with
Unix
either.  (I had heard of Unix, but didn't know anything about it.)  My
training
consisted of my boss handing me the manuals and saying, "Figure it out."
For
the first two weeks I absolutely HATED that system; nothing made sense, vi
seemed insane, and I was stumbling blindly through the documentation (I'd
never
seen a permuted index before).  Then suddenly something clicked, it all
started
to make sense, and I fell in love with it.  That's why I think it's so
important
for people to learn the Unix mindset before trying to deal with Unix
systems.
It's also why I have so little patience with people who don't have the
patience
to work through the learning curve.

I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree, because we have exactly
opposite
opinions on all this.  I love the short, cryptic command names, and I think
man
is the best help system ever devised.  (The GNU Info system, however, is the
spawn of Satan. :-) In case you haven't guessed, I love vi, too, and use it
whenever possible.  If Unix (or Linux) ever gets to the point of losing
things
like this, I'll have no desire to use it.
