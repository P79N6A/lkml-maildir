I've been a fan of Staircase's for a long time; it simply responded faster
and launched progs faster.
I haven't tried nicksched in a while, but it didn't perform as well as
Staircase.
Having a batched mprime torture test in the background still allows me to
play a movie in mplayer, compile a kernel, listen to a CD and browse
the web without glitches. Not that I'd normally watch a movie and listen to
a CD at the same time ;)
Going to try Nicksched again RSN to see if it handles the same load, but
still I have to say I'm mighty pleased with Staircase and the rest of
Con's patches.
