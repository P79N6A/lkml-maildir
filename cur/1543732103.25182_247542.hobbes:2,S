My point is that TCP _does_ have a lot of state that needs to be handled 
in a safe manner by a proper operating system.
The fact that there are OS's out there that are crap doesn't change that 
matter. There are lots of embedded OS's out there that still do 
multitasking in a purely cooperative way. I don't think it's a valid model 
for anything but toys. Same goes for putting TCP in user space. It's 
doable, but it's not an "OS". It's a program loader.
