No.
The default is --- user writes to file on 2.6.18+, goes back to 2.4, and
everything still keeps on working just fine.  
Or, user says "I *specifically* request this feature that I *know* is
not compatible with older kernels", and then they get just that.
Extents are not going to be on by default.  Please, we've got more sense
than that!
Just like the developer who says "I *specifically* code for this fancy
new vmsplice syscall" gets exactly the same.
