It's like this:  turn on the command bit, then after a while the status
bit changes and shows the command took effect.  Turn off the command bit,
ditto.  And if everything is idle/disconnected, nothing should be
turning the bit on ... both bits should stay off at all times.
The driver needs to avoid doing certain things while the chip is in
the middle of activating or de-activating one of the schedules, so
it checks to see whether the bits agree.  If they disagree, the chip
hasn't finished the last enable/disable command.

Maybe.  Thing is, normally it should take just no more than a
millisecond or two for the command to take effect.  So the fact
that either of you can consistently see something happening there
is pretty strange.  Something would seem to be turning the async
schedule on/off a lot.  The driver isn't _supposed_ to do that.
But then, neither is the chip (without the driver telling it to
do so) ... something's being annoying there.

The "lost" interrupts are cases where the VIA hardware (it's never
been seen by me on any other hardware) is supposed to issue an IRQ
as part of the reclaim process, but doesn't.
