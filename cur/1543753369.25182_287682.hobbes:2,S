:D
If it gives you a warm and fuzzy feeling to have the last
cheap-shot, then I'm all for it, it is of no consequence anyway.
And _please_ don't forget to answer this very email with
something of the same substance.
For my part I consider that I've invested a substantial amount
of time in responding to both your conceptual and practical
feedback, as the archives clearly show.
That being said, I have to thank you for making sure that all
the obvious questions have been asked. I now have more than a
dozen archive links of my answers to those. I'll sure come in
handy when writing an FAQ.
Thanks again,
Karim
