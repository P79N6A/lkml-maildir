I'm pretty sure that we can create a scheduler that works well on
an 8-way, and works just as well as the current scheduler on a UP
machine.  There is already a CONFIG_SMP which is all that should
be necessary to distinguish between the two.
What may be of more concern is support for different architectures
such as HMT and NUMA.  What about better scheduler support for
people working in the RT embedded space?  Each of these seem to
have different scheduling requirements.  Do people working on these
'non-typical' machines need to create their own scheduler patches?
OR is there some 'clean' way to incorporate them into the source
tree?
