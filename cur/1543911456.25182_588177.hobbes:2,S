That makes sense. However, Greg's version might work by putting
out a magic init sequence and then changing the configuration.
Then it would just be coded in an obscure way.
However, does this really belong into kernel space? We have been
knowing that user space infrastructure for configuration selection
is necessary and this seems like a fine starting point.
