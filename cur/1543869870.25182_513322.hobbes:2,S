Yes, my patching updates make pretty much all the pv_ops patchable,
including the apic ones.  The simple thing is to fill out paravirt_ops
with the appropriate pointers, then set the .patch operation to
paravirt_default_patch, which will basically turn them all into direct
calls.  If you want to start inlining stuff, then you can do that too.
