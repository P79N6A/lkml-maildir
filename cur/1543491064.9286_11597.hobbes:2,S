Hmm, read the Documentation.  Now there's a novel idea!! ;) Ok, I will

Well, as soon as I finish my intermediate C tutorial (why don't they
teach C in CIS anymore?? Bah, VB and VC++ are the name of the game now. 
COBOL was pretty interesting, though...), I'll look into it some
myself.  I used the linux-3dnow makefile when I compiled mpg123 .59q,
but haven't really seen anything else that (claims to) take advantage of
it.  Perhaps soon I can contribute more  than comments and complaints. 
Unless anyone wants help writing portions of the kernel in COBOL? or IBM
mainframe assembly? No? oh, well, back to the tutorial...
