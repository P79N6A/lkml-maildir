As of 2.6.8.1, there was a small bug in the makefile.  To reproduce:  
Build a modules enabled kernel.
Make sure /lib/modules/2.6.whatever doesn't exist
Run make install.
It won't create the /lib/modules/2.6.whatever directory until you run make 
modules_install.
I think either:
It should tell you to run make modules_install first
or it should do it automatically.
Thanks,
