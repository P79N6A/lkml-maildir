Your problem is probably the -I/usr/include.  It should be
-I/usr/src/linux-xxx/include i.e. should point at your current kernel
sources.  /usr/include/linux et al are *not* guaranteed to do so.
Also note that if your current kernel uses MODVERSIONS, you will have
to compile with something like "-DMODVERSIONS -include
/usr/src/linux-xxx/include/linux/modversions.h" due to the *ahem*
design of MODVERSIONS.
