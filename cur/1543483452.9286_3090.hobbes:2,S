All,
	I'm going to apologize to everyone up front right now.  I had
this information noted down and now I can't find it.  My fault...
	Who is currently responsible for the smbfs files in the kernel?
	I can't find it in the MAINTAINERS file or anywhere in the
Documentation or source files.  I KNOW it's not Volker.  He handed
responsibility of smbmount over to me and he's not maintaining smbfs
at this time.  Can we get the responsible party listed in the MAINTAINERS
file?
	There is a problem in one of the header files (patch attached)
that needs to be addressed.  I currently have a workaround hack
in the Samba CVS tree, but I would like to get the fix into smb_fs.h
so I can get rid of the hack.
	The problem is that in <linux/smb_fs.h> there is an ioctl defined
as follows:
#define SMB_IOC_GETMOUNTUID             _IOR('u', 1, uid_t)
	That works fine for the kernel files and on libc systems where
uid_t and __kernel_uid_t are both 16 bits.  Unfortunately on glibc systems
uid_t is 32 bits and that is causing a conflict.  The smbfs modules get
built in the kernel with uid_t equal to 16 bits but the smbmount/smbumount
programs see 32 bits.  That screws up smbumount on glibc systems.
	The parameter to this ioctl should be __kernel_uid_t since
glibc is not processing it.  The application is working with the kernel's
idea of the uid, not glibc's view of a uid.
	I need the following patch into the kernel as soon as convenient.
It's not a bag-over-head kind of thing and I've got an ugly hack to work
around to problem, but it does need fixing.
	Note: smb_mount.h does correctly use __kernel_uid_t in several
places, so this really does seem like the right fix...  :-)
