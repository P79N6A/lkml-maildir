Say, when a page is created due to a page fault, page->age is set to 
zero instead of whatever it is now.  Then, on the first access, it is 
incremented to one.  All accesses where page->age was previously zero 
cause it to be incremented to one, and subsequent accesses where 
page->age is non-zero cause a doubling rather than an increment. 
This gives a nice heavy priority boost to frequently-accessed pages...

Maybe it is, but in a slightly lateral manner as above.
