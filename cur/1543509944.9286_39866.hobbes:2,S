Does this patch fix your problem?  BTW, to the powers-that-be: all I'm
doing is an explicit cast.  Since I see this elsewhere in the same
file (NULL with an explicit cast), I assume this is acceptable.  Is
it?  I'm happy to look for this problem elsewhere in the kernel
headers if people think its worthwhile.
