Well once it ends up && BROKEN perhaps patches will appear, or before
that. If not well the pain factor will resolve the problem.

No I'm speaking from experience - if a subsystem maintainer is too
busy/working on other projects and the subsystem stops working it
produces a rapid and sudden supply of new maintainers, unless nobody
cares in which case it can go in the bitbucket.

It has drivers using functions that will soon be deleted. That isn't so
much as pushing more like getting fed up of pulling someone elses cart
along.
