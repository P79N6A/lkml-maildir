I ran into a similar problem with the user-mode kernel, and my fix for it 
might be applicable.  I need to #include both user and kernel headers, the 
kernel headers because I'm building a kernel, the user headers because the 
lowest levels are implemented in terms of system calls.
I found out that you are asking for a world of hurt if you include both user 
and kernel headers into the same file.  What I did was split my sources into 
"user" and "kernel" files, which include only user and kernel headers, 
respectively.  Communication between these two groups happens in terms of 
basic C types.
So, what might work for C++ is to have little C files which include the kernel 
headers, which pass their information back out to the C++ files using types 
that everyone agrees on.
