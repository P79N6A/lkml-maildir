Subject: Taint kernel after WARN_ON(condition) v2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Here's an improved version of the patch I sent previously, taking into
account the comments given.
The kernel is sent to tainted within the warn_on_slowpath() function,
and whenever a warning occurs the new taint flag 'W' is set. This is
useful to know if a warning occurred before a BUG by preserving the
warning as a flag in the taint state.
This does not work on architectures where WARN_ON has its own definition. 
These archs are:
	1. s390
	2. superh
	3. avr32
	4. parisc
The maintainers of these architectures have been added in the Cc: list
in this email to alert them to the situation.
The documentation in oops-tracing.txt has been updated to include the
new flag.
