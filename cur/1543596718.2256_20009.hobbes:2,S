Oh this is a fun one :)
When building gcc-2.96 RPM using gcc-2.96 under kernel 2.4.7 on alpha,
the system goes --deeply-- into swap.  Not pretty at all.  The system
will be 200MB+ into swap, with 200MB+ in cache!  I presume this affects
2.4.7-release also.
System has 256MB of swap, and 384MB of RAM.
Only patches applied are Rik's recent OOM killer friendliness patch, and
Andrea's ksoftirq patch.
I ran "vmstat 3" throughout the build, and that output is attached.  I
also manually ran "ps wwwaux >> ps.txt" periodically.  This second
output is not overly helpful, because the system was swapping and
unuseable for the times when the 'ps' output would be most useful.
Both outputs are attached, as they compressed pretty nicely.
