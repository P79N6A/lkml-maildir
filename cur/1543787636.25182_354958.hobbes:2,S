I've been contending this since before Jeff started work on
libata.  But none of the ideas: 64 bit LUN, HCIL removal, etc.,
were accepted with "submit a patch".

All you need is a small, tiny, fast, slim SCSI Core.

Yes, please re-read this thread, and open and read all the
references I've included to SAM, SPC, SAS and SAT of T10.org.
Politics: "Nah, whatever you say, specs are *crap* and we'll
