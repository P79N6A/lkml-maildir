Replying to my own message:
When I chose "No" to "APIC support on uniprocessors", the above error
message disappeared and the machine booted up OK with 2.4.5-ac13.
Please refer to the following diff:
diff .config.old .config
63,65c63
< CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC=y
< # CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC is not set
< CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC=y
---
> # CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC is not set
I think that APIC thing was defined by Intel themselves.
They should have implemented it the best.  How much penalty do I pay 
by not choosing "yes" to "APIC support on uniprocessors"?
Best regards,
G. Hugh Song
