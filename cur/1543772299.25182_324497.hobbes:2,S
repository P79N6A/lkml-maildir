At least there was _me_ who actually intended that... :-p
Thank you for being so understanding.

Once I prepared a cookie per a device, added it into pci_dev.
But one of our NIC driver folks pointed out that it was hard to handle
because there could be many contexts/threads riding on one device at same
time. So I reconsidered it and now come to "a cookie per a context" style.

Oops. It's just my typo. Please ignore it.
