Compile with -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 and it should work.  The problem
is that some of the MSRs and CPUID levels it touches have addresses
above 0x80000000, and newer glibc's running on newer kernels interpret
those as 64-bit negative, i.e. 0xffffffff80000000.
The longrun utility is currently unmaintained (and Longrun control is
being integrated into the cpufreq framework), but I can at least take
minor bug reports.
