If you're integrating drivers that aren't in the kernel tree, you can and
should patch the CML2 rulebase to compensate.  So your patch for
the modified driver should comment out the PARPORT_PC==PARPORT 
requirement.  Problem solved.
More generally, arguments of the form "Non-mainline custom hack X
could invalidate constraint Y, therefore we can't have Y in the
rulebase" are dangerous -- I suspect you could reduce your set of
constraints to nil very quickly that way, and thus badly screw over
the 99% of people who just want to build a more or less stock kernel.

The abortion rights and gun control debates are twin aspects of a deeper
question --- does an individual ever have the right to make decisions
that are literally life-or-death?  And if not the individual, who does?
