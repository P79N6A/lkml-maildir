I've been looking at the pfn (page frame number) stuff, and I'm confused on
one point:  Is the maximum supported memory 64G?  Or is it 16T?
Clearly, the x86 PAE stuff is limited to 64G, but I see no reason that any
pfn from 0 to 0xffffffff should be invalid.  Clearly, without hw on which to
build an implementation, we can hardly honestly say the OS supports 16T.
OTOH, we COULD say that Linux is 16T-ready--couldn't we?
