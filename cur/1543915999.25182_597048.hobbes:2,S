Hmm.  This is an interesting case.  The proc method is forcing
the integer to be either 0 or 1 in a racy fashion.  But none of the
users appear to depend upon that.
So this is the least broken set of binary sysctls I have seen caught
by my check.
A really good fix would be to remove the binary side and then to
modify brnf_sysctl_call_tables to allocate a temporary ctl_table and
integer on the stack and only set ctl->data after we have normalized
the written value.  But since in practice nothing cares about
the race a better fix probably isn't worth it.
