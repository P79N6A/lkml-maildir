I'm certainly thinking alot about this and have made quite a bit of 
progress thanks to the patiience of all.
Now it think it may be time to ponder the expire mechanism.
I was thinking it might be good for me to write up a specification based 
on the discussion so far to make sure that we all have the same 
understanding of what has been discussed. Perhaps this could allow for a 
specification to follow.
Good idea or not?
