The amazing part is that I haven't had a drive fail since I went from 2.4
to 2.6 over a year ago. As you say, it works on your 2.4 kernels, I've "oh
shit" tested it. So if I lose a drive now I'm screwed, not my favorite
operating status.

I was being a bit sarcastic about the "missed the discussion" bit, but I'm
pretty sure ripping out the capability was deliberate. Hopefully it's now
going to be evaluated, and then fixed. One thing Linux doesn't seem to do
well is recover failed drives at boot time, it always seems to take a
bunch of fiddling or even a boot from live CD and hand recover.

Thanks for jumping into this, with ATAPI storage down to about
$1100(US)/TB it's getting really hard to justify SCSI and real hot swap
hardware.
