I did not see any tty refresh problems on my TP with HZ=250 under
2.6.14-rc2-mm1 (excuse the typo in my previous response) under the
adom binary you sent me. I even played two games just to make sure ;)
Is there any chance you can do an strace of the process while it is
slow to redraw your screen? Just to verify how poll() is being called
[if my patch is the problem, then poll() must be being used somewhat
differently than I expected -- e.g. a dependency on the broken
behavior]. The only thing I can think of right now is that I made
timeout_jiffies unsigned, when schedule_timeout() will treat it as
signed, but I'm not sure if that is the problem.
We may want to contact the adom author eventually to figure out how
poll() is being used in the Linux port, if strace is unable to help
further.
Thanks,
Nish
