       Of course, but it will take some time,i've got two followed oops 
  on previous kernel after almost two weeks of stable work. I think week 
  or two would be enough  "timeslice" to say something. Unfortunately i 
  can't try artificial tests on a production system but i guess ordinary 
  load would be enough.
