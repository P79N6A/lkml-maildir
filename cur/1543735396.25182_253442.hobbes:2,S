Dear fellows,
I am new to kernel modules and am trying to get a module work right now. I 
need some tools to debug. In order not to risk the host machine, I am 
thinking of using UML. I downloaded the kernel RPM
------user_mode_linux-2.4.19.5um-0.i386.rpm
and root filesystem
------Debian-3.0r0.ext2.bz2
and got Debian boot sucessfully. However, I still have several questions:
1. The kernel version does not match filesystem:
(none):/lib/modules# ls
2.4.18-37um
(none):/lib/modules# uname -r
2.4.19-5um
2. How do I get my own module compiled into the kernel and debug with it?
I've been reading the UML homepage 
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/index.html
 
but have not really found tips helpful to me. Could anyone give me any hint 
how to do this, or where to look at?
TIA!
Lei
