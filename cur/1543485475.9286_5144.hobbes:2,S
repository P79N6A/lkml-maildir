int $11 == IRQ 11? 
traps.c says:
     set_trap_gate(11,&segment_not_present);
The card I'm playing with is now set up to share an IRQ with a 100BT ethernet
card, and a bttv card. There's no shortage of interrupts. I know that the 
driver works when a stray interrupt from another card wakes it up.
  9:   15298415          XT-PIC  eth0, bttv
int $9 definitely isn't IRQ 9. It's a CPU exception...
coprocessor segment overrun: 0000
CPU:    0
EIP:    0010:[<c84d033a>]
EFLAGS: 00000246
Process insmod (pid: 29930, process nr: 68, stackpage=c5afd000)
Code: 68 fc 13 4d c8 e8 30 26 cc f7 a1 c0 16 4d c8 50 a1 bc 13 4d 
Shouldn't that be 0x20 + (irq) ?
