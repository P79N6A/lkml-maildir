But installation scripts will need to sleep/loop after fdisk,
till the devices are created, right?
And I'm currently mknod'ing /dev/md* devices before creating
the kernel structures with mkraid (which needs the device inode).
Is there any other way to do this? 
sure, in the long run designs like dm with a special control
device are a better than this hack for md. 
Also I wonder how dm works: will dmsetup create the /dev inode
itself, or use udev to do that? would I need the sleep/loop 
in a script creating device mappings to wait for the inode?
