Looking at the asm the first Oops seems to fail in dereferencing
`file->f_op`:
                                if (file->f_op && file->f_op->poll)
				    ^^^^^^^^^^
                                        mask = file->f_op->poll(file, wait);
The filp is pointing to garbage.
The Oops are due current->files->fd[fd] that is pointing to a corrupted
memory area.
If you look eax filp was pointing 0x6e672f69...
I dubit they are af_unix related because I changed nothing in the MM
allocation.
I think that there must be some driver that is corrupting memory. And
since both guys seen this using a backup my first suspect is the driver of
the backup unit. Could you send to me your .config so I'll can make some
comparison?
Comments?
