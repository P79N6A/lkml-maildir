I understand. Before James reported his problem on i915, I have thought
the basic restore on that chip should already be enough, but he proved I was
wrong and I'm not sure if this also happens on other i915 board with different
BIOS. 
And with my patch it has already removed the restore cases for 440BX like type,
coz it's gmch_chip_id == 0 and intel_private.pcidev is NULL, so it won't save
extra space on those chips.
