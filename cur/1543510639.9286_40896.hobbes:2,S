In which case your chosen 37Mhz seems a very wide tolerance.

OK - can you also provide some documentation for this in the error
message.

I can certainly understand your frustration with people reporting
problems with drivers which subsequently turn out to be because
they've overclocked the system. I will not usually report any problem
as software unless it persists when I've reset the system to the
correct speed.

You're entitled to your view and I'd agree if I had any expectations
of reliability for this machine - but it's my home machine and so I
can tolerate more problems than, say, my machine at work or a
server. Personally I think that not having ECC memory is more "stupid"
if you need reliability.
It's about probability anyway - machines are clocked so fast these
days that I don't think you can claim 100% absolute reliability even
at the "correct" speed - yes I'm eating into the safety margin but
I've hammered this machine fairly hard at 83 MHz FSB (which BTW is
still _underclocking_ the memory) without problems so I'm fairly
confident that 75Mhz FSB is within reasonably safe limits for the
expectations that I have of this hardware.
