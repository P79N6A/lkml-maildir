I see a different problem with "ext3 + extends is not ext3 anymore" when 
the feature goes mainstream:
- user with old distri, no extends in use, no kernel support for them
- user has some kind of problem
- uses new rescue disk (aka knoppix at the time of problem) - that then
   is current stuff, and certainly uses extents - fixes problem on disk
   (may be a simple as running lilo/grub from chroot, happens often for me)
- tries to boot back into his distri -> *boom* he lost
