I'm not sure it is possible to answer this globally, without studying the
hardware characteristics of the specific network interfaces involved.

Agreed... but "out of the box" should mean, as shipped with the Linux
distributions.  I don't want to get *us* involved in second-guessing the
author of /dev/random.  The thing to do with the patch is to send it to
Ted and ask *him* to put it in.
