The might_sleep is annotation and well as a conditional preemption
point for the regular kernel. You might want to do a schedule check
there, but it's the wrong function if memory serves me correctly. It's
reserved for things that actually are design to sleep. The rt_spin*()
function are really a method of preserving BKL semantics across real
schedule() calls. You'd have to use something else instead for that
purpose like cond_reschedule() instead.
