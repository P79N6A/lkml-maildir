Looking at the IDE update in rc4-mm1:
+void ide_init_disk(struct gendisk *disk, ide_drive_t *drive)
+{
+	ide_hwif_t *hwif = drive->hwif;
+	unsigned int unit = drive->select.all & (1 << 4);
+
+	disk->major = hwif->major;
+	disk->first_minor = unit << PARTN_BITS;
+	sprintf(disk->disk_name, "hd%c", 'a' + hwif->index * MAX_DRIVES + unit);
+	disk->queue = drive->queue;
+}
Looks funny.
Could someone try this?
-	unsigned int unit = drive->select.all & (1 << 4);
+	unsigned int unit = (drive->select.all >> 4) & 1;
