I'm working on a clockpro implementation that essentialy keeps all
resident pages on 1 clock. In this case readahead pages will also not
fragment over the active/inactive lists but stay in order. Would that
also satisfy your requirements?
Code can be found at:

Note however that this is work in progress and rather unstable, there
are some livelock scenarios in there.
Kind regards,
