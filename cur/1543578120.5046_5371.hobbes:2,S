Right, but now there is a problem: Software RAID. The RAID code of 2.4.0
is not backwards compatible to the one in 2.2.18; if somebody has used
2.4.0 on softraid and discovers some problem, he can not switch back to
some official 2.2 kernel. In order to make it possible to switch between
kernel releases, every vendor now really is forced to integrate the new
RAID0.90 code to their 2.2 kernel. IMHO this code should be integrated to
the next official 2.2 kernel so people can use whatever they want.
