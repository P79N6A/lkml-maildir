It's still very close to what you are seeing.
In my RH 6.0 scripts, changing to runlevel 3 is just
before: Bringing up interface lo.
My system's normal sequence is:
init: Entering runlevel: 3
network: Bringing up interface lo succeeded
netowrk: Bringing up interface eth0 succeeded
But in test6-preAny#, Bringing up interface lo just hangs.
