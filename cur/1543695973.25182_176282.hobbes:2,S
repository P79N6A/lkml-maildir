Hello.
I was reading El Reg this morning when they discussed "execution protection"
  on the new Intel (IA64) and AMD (K8 and above) chips.
Does the Linux kernel have support for preventing execution of certain
  memory regions on those architectures?
Also, I know that some implementations of x86 stack protection are out there;
  I've not seen them in the vanilla kernels; is there any plan to implement
  them?
Thank you!
-Joseph

"Asked by CollabNet CTO Brian Behlendorf whether Microsoft will enforce its
 patents against open source projects, Mundie replied, 'Yes, absolutely.'
 An audience member pointed out that many open source projects aren't
 funded and so can't afford legal representation to rival Microsoft's. 'Oh
 well,' said Mundie. 'Get your money, and let's go to court.' 
Microsoft's patents only defensive?
