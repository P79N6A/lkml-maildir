One big problem is how to get rid of the spinlocks after the exception though
(hardware access usually happens inside a spinlock) 
I presume you could return a magic value (all ones), but then you still
have to make sure the driver doesn't break when that happens. That would
likely require testing for that value on every read access and make
the code similarly ugly and difficult to write as with Linus' 
explicit checking model.
But there may be no other choice, see below...

Yes, there are often magic bits in northbridges and chipsets. Problem is that 
they're sometimes buggy (because not well tested) and give random errors.
Also enabling them tends to trigger a *lot* of bugs in random drivers.

They usually give an MCE, but it is not exact for writes (happens sometime
later) and may not even be for reads.
The only sane way to handle them would be a global call back per pci_dev,
but then you run into problems with the locking again.
Also in my experience from AMD64 which originally was a bit aggressive
on enabling MCEs: enabling MCEs increases your kernel support load a lot.
Many people have slightly buggy systems which still happen to work mostly.
If you report every problem you as kernel maintainer will be flooded with
reports about things you can nothing to do about. So I don't think it would
make sense to enable it by default.
One idea I played with was to only enable it for driver debugging, but
it is hard to educate driver developers about it (most just don't know 
about it and we have no way to pass information to them). In the end 
I removed it because it was too much hazzle. In short this stuff
probably only makes sense when you're a system vendor who sells
support contracts for whole systems including hardware support.
For the normal linux model where software is independent from hardware
(and hardware is usually crappy) it just doesn't work very well.
