Sorry... I should also point out that I was thinking of tulip
architecture and similar architectures, where you have a fixed number of
Skbs allocated at all times, and that number doesn't change for the
lifetime of the driver.
Clearly not all cases would benefit from skb recycling, but there are a
number of rx-ring-based systems where this would be useful, and (AFAICS)
reduce the work needed to be done by the system, and reduce the amount
of overall DMA traffic by a bit.
