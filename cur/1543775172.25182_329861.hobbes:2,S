Sorry for not being specific. I managed to trace down the problem to the 
new patch. linux 2.6.13-rc1 created a new file include/net/ieee80211.h
and there's an existing file in the ipw2200 directory with the same 
name ieee80211.h.
All the ipw2200 files has ...
 	#include <net/ieee80211.h>
and that points to the new linux header in 
/usr/src/linux/include/net/ieee80211.h instead of the local include file 
under the ipw2200/net directory.
I've modified all ipw2200 files to #include "net/ieee80211.h" and now it 
compiles ok.
Thanks,
Jeff.
