Ahh, ok.
This does not seem to be enough, however, because the original code
in mm/init.c is __init, so I can't call it during resume.  Moreover, it calls
some more __init functions, so to use it I'll have to move the allocation
of the resume temporary page tables to the kernel initialization code.
If I do this, I'll have to mark the allocated pages as nosave (see below)
and make sure they will always get the same physical addresses.  I am
going to see if I can do this, but I need some time.
Anyway this could be a long-term solution, but in the short term the bug
is there and needs fixing ASAP.  One good thing about the current
solution is that it does not break anything outside of swsusp _for_ _sure_.

Rather I've reserved a set of individual pages that are only linked
via the page tables structure.  IMO it's better to mark them as nosave
as soon as they get allocated or I'll need to browse the entire
structure to do this.  Also, I need to make them get always the
same physical addresses and tell the memory management
they are not free.
