10.12.8 in the ia32 manual volume 3a says:
"
When remapping a page that was previously mapped as a cacheable memory type to
a WC page, an operating system can avoid this type of aliasing by doing the
following:
...
3. Create a new mapping to the same physical address with a new memory type, for
   instance, WC.
4. Flush the caches on all processors that may have used the mapping previously.
   Note on processors that support self-snooping, CPUID feature flag bit 27, this
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   step is unnecessary.
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
"
That is exactly the situation in pageattr.c. You're saying the manual is wrong
here?

Unless there are known errata (i'm not aware of any) it is safe according to the manual.
