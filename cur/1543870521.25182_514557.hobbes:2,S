Oops!, above text should read the same as the subject line,  problems 
seen on 2.6.21-rc1 and 2.6.21-rc2.
The strace is huge 2737627 2007-03-02 03:28 KWIN.out.  Further digging 
shows kwin, kicker and klauncher and perhaps other kdeinit stuff also 
die - no desktop icons after those 3 are started from the commandline. 
Moving kdesktop_lock out of /opt/kde3/bin, everything comes back after 
the video is blanked -- no password required.
I shall run like that (2.6.21-rc2-git1 currently) and wait for openSUSE 
to upgrade to 2.6.21. I can send the straces of kicker and kwin on if 
you think it's still worth it.
Thanks and Regards
Sid.
