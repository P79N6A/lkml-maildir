Hi All,
> My doubt is ----In function ip_build_xmit , when ip is setting up skb
> header,it is  using skb_reserve(skb,hh_len),which i guess is for setting
> up a headroom in skb for Link layer header.After coming out of this
function
> it is calling dev_queue_xmit().Out here also after certain processings it
> is forwarding the skb struct to hard_start_xmit() function of the device
> driver and in the book it says that hard_start_xmit() function sends the
> header.
> So, could u please tell me where particularly , kernel is adding Link
> Header.
