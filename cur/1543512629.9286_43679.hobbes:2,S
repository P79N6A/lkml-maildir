It happens here, too.
I'm just taking a look. The code is perverted.
If system is idle (that is measured once a second *), it starts
spinning within the loop telling bios that we are idle. That "idle
call" in a loop is maybe done with disabled interrupts (damaging
killing interrupt response?)
What is more funny is that in case of cpu being idle, apm_do_idle() is
probably going to be called only half of a time. See:
schedule_timeout(HZ)
apm_do_idle()
	while (1)
		if (jiffies-start > HZ)
			break
and repeat. That gives calls being done only half of a time. Patch
appended.
* -- what happens if there's _another_ program that wakes up once a
second? I think that with 0.01 probability apm_do_idle() will be never
called on such system. I think that this is ugly and that it can hurt
in real life.
