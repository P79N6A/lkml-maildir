Subject: [patch] New version of IPMI driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I've split up the driver, creating working 2.4.19 and 2.5.31 versions of 
the driver (and even tested them!) and split the emulation code into a 
separate patch.
I also noticed that 2.5.31 timer interrupts occur at 1ms instead of 
10ms, so it should provide acceptable speed without high-res timers. 
 2.4 without high-res timers or interrupts will still be very slow.
I have not yet tested interrupts, because I don't have a card that 
supports them (it's on its way).  However, that's pretty straightforward.

Please, try it out and tell me what you think.  Again, I'm shooting for 
getting this in the mainstream kernel.
