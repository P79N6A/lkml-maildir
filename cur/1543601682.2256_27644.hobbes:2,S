I can add one more into the mix: what the hell had happened in rd.c?
a) you reintroduced the crap with rd_inodes[]
b) just try to call ioctl(fd, BLKFLSBUF) twice. Oops...
c) WTF with acrobatics around initrd_bd_op?  FWIW, initrd has no business
being a block device and both old and new variants are ugly, but what's
the point of adding extra tricks?
d) call ioctl(fd, BLKFLSBUF) and open the thing one more time before
closing fd.  Watch what happens.  It's broken by design.
I realize that you had that file modified in your tree, but bloody hell,
it doesn't mean "ignore any changes that happened in mainline kernel
without even looking at them".  As for the BLKFLSBUF...  How was it supposed
to work?
