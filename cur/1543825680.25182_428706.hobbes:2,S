And that's exactly where we have the lock_page().
And you ignored the list of _requirements_ I had, so you just missed the 
other place you _have_ to have the unplug, namely in the "found a page 
that was not yet up-to-date" case (look for the other lock_page()). 
Because the person who started the IO might be off doing something else, 
and may not be unplugging now (or ever, in the case of readahead).
In other words, when you start arguing, at least read my emails. Your 
suggestion would have introduced a bug by not waiting on that other place.
