I did not try every version from 0.9.10 to 0.9.13. I can remember
0.9.9 (recommended) did not work and 0.9.14-pre did not work/compile
(most current) so I tried 0.9.13 - and this one worked :)
Of course maybe there is an other cause 0.9.9 not working (I had to
upgrade the normal modutils too), but I would simply recommend 0.9.13 
for 2.6-test5.
Regards,
