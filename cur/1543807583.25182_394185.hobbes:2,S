So I just posted my patches to lkml if you want to see the details.
But the way I have implemented it each container has a pid in it's parent's
pid namespace.  
That pid to top looks essentially a thread group leader, and top will
tell you which container contains the cpu hogs.
Currently from the outside your choice is to kill or not kill the entire
container.  Which let's you kill the cpu hogs.  The control is not broken
down so fine that it is easy to do something the sysadmin of the container
should be doing.
