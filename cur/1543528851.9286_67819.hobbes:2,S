Oops... argc :-) argc contains exactly argc pointers.  They can point to
NULL string (of course there are no way to get such argv in execve

Are you sure ?

There just very strange limitation that program can change it's arguments
but can not change number of arguments...

Hmm. Your programs are doing this all the time. sh scripts, etc.
There are even few functions to do so (even POSIX ones!!!). Of course it's
not clear how important is to know if environment is changed. But if we
should not care about environment then why there are /proc/<number>/environ 
at all ???

On other hand if you'll allow to write in /proc/self/cmdline you need to
keep this information somewhere. Yes, this will solve problem with ftpwho.
But /proc/self/environ will still show there not actual information as
it's used by program right now but yesterday's show :-/

AFAIK this way should work with my patch as well. It's just UGLY.
