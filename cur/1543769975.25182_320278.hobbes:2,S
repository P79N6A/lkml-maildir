There are definitely those who would prefer to have the functionality,
at least as an option, in the mainline kernel. The group that I contract
for get heartburn about having to patch every kernel running on every
development workstation and every production system. We need hard RT,
but currently when we have to have hard RT we go with a different
product. Another thing that some of us want/need is a hard real-time
Linux that doesn't create the segregation that most of these specialized
products create. Currently there are damn few choices for real posix
applications development with hard RT requirements running in a Unix
environment.
