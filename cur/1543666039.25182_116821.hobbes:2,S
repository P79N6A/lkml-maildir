I wanted to give this a go but it does not apply vs my 2.5.64. None of
the patches I've applied to it touch that file so I'm guessing I'm
missing something else.
What am I missing and/or is it possible to get this vs 2.5.64? I tried
hand adding it in but didn't due to the files being rather different.
