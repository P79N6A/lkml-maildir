I've now got that system back online, so I've enclosed the
relevant extracts from /var/log/messages.

Let's see...

 Q> 239.029

Nodz.

See the enclosed.
It looks like the drive is always reporting the same capacity
independant of what disk has been inserted, which sounds like
a hardware bug that the kernel needs to be aware of...
Best wishes from Riley.

following messages appear:
