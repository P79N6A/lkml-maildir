I'd like to weigh in on this issue as I'm having the same issue as Ben.
My application doesnt consider these to be exceptional events, but 
normal expected events, and thus
I need them to be handled like normal events. (I can explain more off 
list if you'd like)
So I just want to ignore all events for some time and then deal with any 
HUP's or ERR's at the appropriate time.
When I used poll(), I always accomplished this by leaving this fd out of 
the poll fd set.
This wasnt a huge hit because I basically had to rebuild the poll fd set 
at every iteration anyway as it changes rapidly.
Now I'm switching to epoll, and the great thing about the epoll 
interface is I don't have to rebuild the entire fd set at every iteration.
Like Ben, I'd prefer to be able to disable ALL events on a fd descriptor 
for some time, instead of removing it entirely.
Since with poll I had to rebuild the set anyway, this 'disable' feature 
wasnt really useful, but would be a nice-to-have for epoll.
