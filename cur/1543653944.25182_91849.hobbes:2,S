Downloading the latest 2.5.48 and 2.4.20rc3, I noticed their is no
wireless driver for the bcm4301 chipset(broadcom). Dell uses it for its
TrueMobile 1811 wireless and Linksys uses it for their new WMP11 revision
2.7 cards and it seems that linksys or broadcom doesnt have a driver. Is
anyone writing a wireless driver for the broadcom chipset?
