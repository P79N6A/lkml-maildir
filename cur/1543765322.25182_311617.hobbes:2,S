It will work on most.  Some don't like where the nvidia installer dumps
it files in some cases.  Certainly doesn't work on every amd64 system
since they can't agree where 64bit libs should go yet.
It also violates my principles more than using binary only drivers does.
All files in /usr (except /usr/local) _must_ be installed by one package
management tool.  No excaptions allowed.  I haven't had to reinstall for
6 years, so I am sticking with my principles.
