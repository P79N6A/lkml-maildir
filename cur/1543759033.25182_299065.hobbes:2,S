as one of the users since the mid 2.0 series. I really think this is the 
best approach.
with any 'stable' kernel series I have always had to wait at least a few 
days from the release to allow people to report brown-bag problems, and 
then I've needed to test it on my particular hardware to make sure there 
are no driver gotcha's that happen to bite my configuration, then I can 
deploy (either immediatly if it's a security issue, or after load testing 
if it's not)
the 2.6.odd/even won't change this at all
the 2.6.x.y will leave me needing to do the same thing for each new x, but 
any new .y releases that take place should be able to follow a more rapid 
path as they will probably have _very_ few changes in them (i.e. no driver 
updates that aren't significant bugfixes). and the ability to do more then 
one .y release if nessasary without confusing people is definantly an 
advantage over the odd/even approach

good point

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
