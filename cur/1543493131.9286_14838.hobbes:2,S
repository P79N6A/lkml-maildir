ok, can't we do something to attract the user's attention ?
a friends Eterm just gave a segmentation fault (coredump) (and it
couldn't even coredump). not very helpfull as it couldn't even coredump.
[maybe: segmentation fault (coredump failed: disk full) as he suggested ;)]
it's just very annoying that it never gave you a clue that your disk is
full, maybe the kernel could write something to console ? send something
to syslog ?
i guess the coredump-issue is glibc-related.
is this problem already taken care of ?
