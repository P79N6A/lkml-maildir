One more thing ...
Barriers are useless unless always used.
Given drives will autoflush cache and should an error occur, then a manual
flush cache is issued the drive goes offline.  The state machine is in an
error and can not be recovered.  So actually there needs to be an error
state test opcode or something first.
However, since barriers generally are not wrapped around all writes
associated with the entire transaction (ie transaction is larger than
total sectors transferred), multiple writes, flush(1), down block,
flush(2) for journalling ...
Failure on flush(1) could play havoc if there were cached writes from
previous non journalled transactions to the device.  This kind of recovery
would require block_request_aging similar to VM paging (clean/dirty lists)
and has the potential to be come ugly.
I have the full model to deploy, but I have no time or desire to champion
the project.
