well... why not go one step further and eliminate the flags argument
entirely? And use pci_name() for the name (so eliminate the argument ;)
and always pass pdev as data, so that that argument can go away too....
that'll cover 99% of the request_irq() users for pci devices.. and makes
it really nicely simple and consistent.
