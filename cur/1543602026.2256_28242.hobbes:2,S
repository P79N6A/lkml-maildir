Being it +19 it is light with respect to the other tasks in the system,
mainly considering there's one for each cpu.

one reschedule every few seconds sounds ok.

if you try to put a printk also in do_softirq you'll see why it is
not the common case :)
also you may want to put the printk in the schedule() path, ksoftirqd
may just be rescheduled once, and run many of the do_softirq().
