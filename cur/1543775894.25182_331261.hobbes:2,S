Ah.  But then, one solution was to avoid the issue at all, and have the
directory inside a file act as a mountpoint.  After all, mount --bind
doesn't cause problems...
Hey!  This sounds like metafs (/meta) already!  I wonder if we can do
file-as-dir in /meta, and just not support user-created hardlinks there?
 (other than creating brand-new files, of course...)
