Hi Vojtech,
I have some more input patches for you. Please let me know if you like any
of these and I will push them onto bkbits.
01-whitespace.patch
	- get rid of trailing whitespace in sermouse.c and vsxxxaa.c
02-remove-class-device-on-disconnect.patch
	- when hardware device associated with evdev, mousedev, joydev or
          tsdev is disconnected remove class device right away, do not wait
	  till the last user of corresponding /dev/input/ device closes it.
          It allows hardware drivers be unloaded at any time.
03-link-input_dev-and-serio.patch
	- Link input_dev->dev and serio.dev so when corresponding class
	  devices are created they are linked (device, driver) to their
          serio driver and device.
04-i8042-debug.patch
	- Alow activate i8042 debugging without recompiling, I am tired of
	  asking people to edit/recompile.
05-i8042-old-pm-remove.patch
	- get rid of old-style PM handling as APM calls device_suspend
	  so we actually were doing the same work twice.
06-i8042-remove-reboot-notifier.patch
	- since i8042 now has shutdown driver core method we do not need
	  reboot notifier, i8042_shutdown will do the work.
07-input-remove-pm_dev.patch
	- pm_dev is deprecated and nobody except for h3600 (which does not
          even compile) uses it, remove from input core.
Thanks!
