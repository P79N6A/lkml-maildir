Can you characterize the problem in more detail for me?  That is,
exactly what link order constraints you are trying to obey.
I am thinking about this:
    # Makefile
    link-first := drivers/scsi/foo.o drivers/i2o/%o drivers/scsi/bar.o
    link-last :=
    DRIVERS := \
	$(filter $(link-first), $(DRIVERS)) \
	$(filter-out $(link-first) $(link-last), $(DRIVERS)) \
	$(filter $(link-last), $(DRIVERS))
This is just a preliminary thought.  I'd like to know more about the
problem.
