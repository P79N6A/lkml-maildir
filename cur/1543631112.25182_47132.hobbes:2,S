   I still need tlb_end_vma in this case - or at least I need a hook
   that gets called after all the tlb_remove_tlb_entry calls are done but
   before clear_page_tables is called.  If I had that hook (called in
   both the exit_mmap and unmap cases) then I would not need the
   tlb_start/end_vma hooks.
You get called via pte_free_tlb() and pmd_free_tlb() for every
operation performed by clear_page_tables().  The PTEs themselves are
all cleared out at the point that clear_page_tables, so you can't
possibly need the PTE contents.  I am assuming therefore you just
need to get at the linkage, and those two pte/pmd hooks give you
that.
