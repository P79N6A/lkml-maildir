That's handled in the architecture specific code -- because it's
different on each architecture and the architecture specific code does
memory reservation. IA64 already can handle this case (on IA64,
specifying 0 is the same than leaving out the base address, and that's
why I wanted to keep that semantics). I think it doesn't also make
sense on i386/x86_64 to choose 0 as real base address, because the
value below 1 MB is special for booting ...

I think you're right -- with the relocatable kernel it makes sense to
have the kernel to decide where to reservate that memory. But that's
beyond of the scope of that patch series -- however, I can come up
with a solution, after that patch has been finished.
Thanks,
