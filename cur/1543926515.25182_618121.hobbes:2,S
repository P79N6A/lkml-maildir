Hrm, maybe both ?
Knowing which page frame number has been swapped out is not always as
relevant as knowing the page's virtual address (when it has one). Saving
both the PFN and the page's virtual address could give us useful
information when the page is not mapped.
We face two possible approaches : either we save both the address and
the pfn at each event and later have the information at once in the
trace, or we instrument the kernel virtual addresses map/unmap
operations and let the trace analyzer figure out the mappings.
It is sometimes a big benefit traffic-wise to let the userspace tool do
recreate the kernel structures from the traced information, but it
involved specialized treatment in the userspace tools. If we chose this
solution, we could simply save the PFN in the event, as you propose.

Yep, I guess we could put useful markers beside the count_vm_events
inline function calls.
High level overview :
We currently have a "LTTng statedump", which iterates on the mappings of
all tasks at trace start time to dump them in the trace. We also
instrument memory allocation/free. We therefore have much of the
information needed to recreate the memory mappings in the kernel at any
point during the trace by "replaying" the trace.
Having the events that helps us to recreate it
- precisely
- efficiently
- with a level of generality that should not break "too much" between
  kernel versions
would be useful to us.
Then we could start creating plugins in our userspace trace analysis
tool to analyze fun stuff such as sources of memory fragmentation.
Then coupling that with, eventually, performance counter, we could start
doing really fun things with cache misses...
It can also be useful to you guys to find our problems by adding ad-hoc
instrumentation to the VM code when pinpointing the cause of a problem.
Martin Bligh made interesting things applying a tracer to the vm,
described in "Linux Kernel Debugging on Google-sized clusters" in
OLS2007 proceedings.
