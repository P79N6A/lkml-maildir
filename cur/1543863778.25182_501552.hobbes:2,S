Actually, the bug is that because of MMC_RSP_R6 not being handled in
the switch in au1xmmc_send_command(), the controller gets told that
no response is expected. I changed the R6 to R1 in mmc.h, thats why
it worked in the demoboard, and it also works now on the previously
thought-to-be-broken HW.
So it's only broken in releases < 2.6.20-rc6.
Thanks,
