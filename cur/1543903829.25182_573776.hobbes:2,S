Didn't we just reinstate doing that?
/me goes look at .23-rc1
# grep __GFP_ZERO mm/sl[uoa]b.c
mm/slab.c:      BUG_ON(flags & ~(GFP_DMA | __GFP_ZERO | GFP_LEVEL_MASK));
mm/slab.c:      if (unlikely((flags & __GFP_ZERO) && ptr))
mm/slab.c:      if (unlikely((flags & __GFP_ZERO) && objp))
mm/slob.c:      if (unlikely((gfp & __GFP_ZERO) && b))
mm/slub.c:      BUG_ON(flags & ~(GFP_DMA | __GFP_ZERO | GFP_LEVEL_MASK));
mm/slub.c:      if (unlikely((gfpflags & __GFP_ZERO) && object))
seems to suggest we do.
