I will follow up on this with the appropriate subsystem lists ASAP. 
Thanks for getting me redirected appropriately.

I am not quite sure what to do about this part... my boot device for the 
system is on one of the sata_nv channels which remains functional and 
does not get disabled by the resource conflict.
How shall I best attempt the suggested workaround without having to 
delete the sata_nv driver from the kernel thus rendering the kernel 
unbootable on this machine? Is there some way to pass the appropriate 
option at boot instead of at module load time or some file I could 
modify to enable the specified option in the code?

Thanks for the fast reply!
