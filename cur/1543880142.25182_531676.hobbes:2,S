yes, it would be nice to do a:
	strace -o kaffine.log -f -tttTTT kaffeine
log. Because in your old log this is visible:
 clone(child_stack=0xb02394a4, 
 flags=CLONE_VM|CLONE_FS|CLONE_FILES|CLONE_SIGHAND|CLONE_THREAD|CLONE_SYSVSEM|CLONE_SETTLS|CLONE_PARENT_SETTID|CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID, 
 parent_tidptr=0xb0239bd8, {entry_number:6, base_addr:0xb0239b90, 
 limit:1048575, seg_32bit:1, contents:0, read_exec_only:0, 
 limit_in_pages:1, seg_not_present:0, useable:1}, 
 child_tidptr=0xb0239bd8) = 11340
 futex(0x89ac218, FUTEX_WAKE, 1)         = 1
we cloned a task and immediately afterwards we used futex 0x89ac218. 
After that point many things happen, but the lockup itself:
 futex(0x89ac218, FUTEX_WAIT, 2, NULL)   = 0
 futex(0x89ac218, FUTEX_WAIT, 2, NULL)   = 0
 futex(0x89ac218, FUTEX_WAIT, 2, NULL)   = 0
is the same futex. Probably related to the same child thread? It would 
be nice to also get a gdb backtrace:
	gdb kaffine
	<reproduce the hang>
	Ctrl-C
	bt
this should give you a gdb backtrace of that kaffeine hang. Thanks,
	Ingo
