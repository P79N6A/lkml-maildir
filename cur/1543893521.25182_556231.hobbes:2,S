We really should just get that flag into mainline so that it breaks
for people before they submit patches.  We run into this constantly.
Add -Werror-implicit-function-declaration
This makes builds fail sooner if something is implicitly defined instead
of having to wait half an hour for it to fail at the linking stage.
