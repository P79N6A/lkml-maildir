Those are not my patches. They belong to a certain Christian Koenig. He 
doesn't mantain them any more and I'm searching for someone to mantain 
this project.
I know very little about kernel programming, but I liked the idea of 
having such a feature in the kernel. It gives more freedom in compiling 
the kernel. Maybe one day we would have the main piece of the kernel as 
a standard and only have to recompile modules. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO 
WITH MICROKERNELS. Multibooting is a different stuff.
SO, if somebody knows who might want to update this patches, it would be 
great.
Thanks!!
