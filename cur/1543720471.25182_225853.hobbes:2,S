Hi,
as I stated before, I created a generic training set in phase 2 of the
three phases compilation process by utilizing the kernel in various
ways: fore- and background activities, networking, filesystems, etc.
The PGO kernel module and the PGO daemon pgod are included in the
newest patch. You can create your own specialized training set for your
specific task. That's the big advantage of kernel PGO. This is the
first patch using both technologies of the Intel C/C++ Compiler, IPO
(Inter Procedural Optimization) and PGO (Profile Guided Optimization),
together.
