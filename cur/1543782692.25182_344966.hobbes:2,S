FWIW, I've just built a linux kernel on my cygwin system using a ppc cross
compiler.
Here's roughly what I did (this is not verbatim what I did but it should
serve as a rough guide):
  c:\>c:\cygwin\bin\bash
  bash$ export PATH=/bin:$PATH
  bash$ cd /tmp
  bash$ wget 
http://cygwin.com/snapshots/cygwin-inst-20050826.tar.bz2
  bash$ wget 
http://cygwin.com/snapshots/cygwin1-20050826.dll.bz2
  bash$ wget 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org
:/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.12.tar.bz2
  bash$ bzip2 -d cygwin1-20050826.dll.bz2
  bash$ cd /
  bash$ # expect some errors about being unable to overwrite
  bash$ # cygwin1.dll below
  bash$ tar xjf /tmp/cygwin-inst-20050826.tar.bz2
  bash$ # exit from the running cygwin process so that the cygwin DLL can
  bash$ # be overwritten
  bash$ exit
  c:\>copy c:\cygwin\tmp\cygwin1-20050826.dll c:\cygwin\bin\cygwin1.dll
  c:\>c:\cygwin\bin\bash
  bash$ export PATH=/bin:/path-to-cross/compiler:$PATH
  bash$ mkdir /cygdrive/c/managed /managed
  bash$ mount -b -o managed c:/managed /managed
  bash$ cd /managed
  bash$ tar xjf /tmp/linux-2.6.12.tar.bz2
  bash$ cd linux-2.6.12
  bash$ make ARCH=ppc HOST_LOADLIBES=-lintl defconfig
  bash$ make ARCH=ppc CROSS_COMPILE=ppc-linux-
Note that I have recently added the elf.h header files to cygwin so this
should allow the kernel to be built without any addition steps.  But,
you need to download a cygwin snapshot to get this because the headers
aren't part of the latest version of cygwin yet.  You also need to
specify HOST_LOADLIBES on the command line because it's required for
cygwin.  Using a "managed" mount also allows the creation of files with
mixed case.
I haven't yet checked that the kernel produced from these steps works
but the make does seem to complete without error.
