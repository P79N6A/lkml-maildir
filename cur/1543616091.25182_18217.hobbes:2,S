Hi all
I'm joining the host of beta testers involved in that patch...
It's currently running on a production machine :
dual PII350 on ASUS P2B-DS
3 SCSI hard drives
512MB of RAM
3C905C
This is a network server running squid-cache www proxy with
a medium load (700 clients on a T3), mysqld, apache, proftpd.
kernel is stock 2.4.17 - and so far, so good.
Cheers,
François Cami
