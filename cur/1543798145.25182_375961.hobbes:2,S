Subject: [PATCH 03/04] Cpuset: mark number_of_cpusets read_mostly
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/12/14/54

Mark cpuset global 'number_of_cpusets' as __read_mostly.
This global is accessed everytime a zone is considered
in the zonelist loops beneath __alloc_pages, looking for
a free memory page.  If number_of_cpusets is just one,
then we can short circuit the mems_allowed check.
Since this global is read alot on a hot path, and written
rarely, it is an excellent candidate for __read_mostly.
Thanks to Christoph Lameter for the suggestion.
