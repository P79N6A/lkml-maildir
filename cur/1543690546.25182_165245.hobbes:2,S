That change was in 2.4.10 with the andrea VM merge.  Though, I wouldn't use
it until about 2.4.14/16+ (don't use 2.4.15)

Others have asked before about this.
But let me inject some hearsay: 
With the buffer & pagecache merge patch, there is much less duplication of
data, but still some.  Also, pagecache doesn't reference into buffer cache
and the same data can be read twice (ie, if you're reading directly from
/dev/hda, and a filesytem on /dev/hdaX at the same time).
There is less duplication in 2.6, but I believe pagecache still doesn't
reference to buffer cache in there too.
Can someone say in more detail?
