	But various high level kernel people, such as Jeff, have
decided that binary firmwares *must* be removed from the kernel
because of legal "issues" (GPL == source available). In 2.6.X, it
seems that the tolerance towards this "issue" will end, so all those
nasty details will have to work.
	Of course, 2.4.X is more "don't rock the boat".
	Have fun...
