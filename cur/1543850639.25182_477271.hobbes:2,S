I read source code more and now I understand that the effect of
leave_mm() is not only
1. bypassing the invocation to local_flush_tlb(), but also
2. prevent the curent CPU from receiving any more INVALIDATE_TLB_VECTOR IPI.
Some material makes me understand the lazy TLB mode this way, that is,
a CPU's TLB will not be flushed since it enters lazy TLB mode till it
return to normal TLB mode.
But according to the source code, it seems that a CPU still has to
undergo at most one time TLB flush, that is, the flush caused by
loading CR3 with swapper_pg_dir.
Could any one confirm whether my original understanding and my
corrective understanding is correct? Thank you very much.
