I have only one filesystem - this one large ReiserFS, if that's
the question. Here is "fdisk -l":
Disk /dev/hda: 81.9 GB, 81963220480 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 9964 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes
    Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/hda1               1         122      979933+  82  Linux swap
/dev/hda2             123        9964    79055865   83  Linux
