I don't know what would have caused this.  Was 2.6.18-rc1-mm2 OK?
Patches which touch arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c are:
x86_64-mm-i386-up-generic-arch.patch
x86_64-mm-i386-io-apic-access.patch
genirq-convert-the-i386-architecture-to-irq-chips.patch
initial-generic-hypertransport-interrupt-support.patch
genirq-i386-irq-remove-the-msi-assumption-that-irq-==-vector.patch
genirq-i386-irq-move-msi-message-composition-into-io_apicc.patch
genirq-i386-irq-dynamic-irq-support.patch
The developers of those patches are cc'ed.
A bisection search would be useful, if you have the time.  I'd zero in on
the x86_64 tree initially.  Perhaps x86_64-mm-i386-io-apic-access.patch.
Or it could be something else altogether.
