I've been spending a lot of time debugging a threaded program lately,
and have been bitten by the feature in the ELF coredump logic which
disables corefile generation when current->mm->count != 1.  (i.e. when
any child processes have been created with CLONE_VM)
For the moment I've found a satisfactory (although ugly) workaround
involving forking in a sigsegv handler and then faulting again.
However, I've been wondering at the logic behind this test.  Is it
assuming that mm->count is always 0 or 1, and so could be replaced
with "->count == 0"?  Is it because coredumps for threaded programs
would otherwise be awfully lame, or is it just that my knowledge of
using gdb on threaded corefiles is poor?  (before I found this trick,
I was able to generate corefiles on child threads, but they tended to
always have the wrong stack as far as I could tell.)  Is it some
inscrutable reason related to devious virtual memory algorithms?
It strikes me that coredumps are as useful on threaded programs as on
any other, and I wonder what would need to be done (in the kernel and
in gdb) to get them working without application hackery.
Thoughts?
