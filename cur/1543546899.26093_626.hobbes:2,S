I already tried to do so, but I could not find a way.to lock the CD-ROM tray on
my (SCSI DVD) CD-ROM drive after it has been mounted with the door not being
lock. How can this be done ? 
'setcd -l1' does not work
'echo 1 > /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/lock' doesn't either
On my system, the locking of the CD-ROM drive seems to be only done during
mounting of the media. I found no way to change locking status afterwards (only
at the next mount, or unlocking it with unmount when it has been locked).
Thanks for all your help,
Rene
