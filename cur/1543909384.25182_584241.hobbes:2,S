This is not a bug, this is special kind of calculation - total limit is
number of physical devices multiplied by theirs limits. It was done 
_on purpose_ to allow different device to have different limits (for 
example in distributed storage project it is possible to have both remote 
and local node in the same device, but local device should not have _any_
limit at all, but network one should).
Virtual device essentially has _no_ limit. And that as done on purpose.
