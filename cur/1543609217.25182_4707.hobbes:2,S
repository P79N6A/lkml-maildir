Big picture time. What costs more - the odd five cache line hit or swapping
200Kbytes/second on and off disk ? - thats obviously workload dependant.
Perhaps at some point we need to accept there is a memory/speed tradeoff
throughout the kernel and we need a CONFIG option for it - especially for
the handheld world. I don't want to do lots of I/O on an ipaq, I don't need
big tcp hashes, and I'd rather take a small performance hit.
