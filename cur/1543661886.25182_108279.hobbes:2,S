Pavel's patch changes nmi.c to include:
extern struct sys_device device_apic;
static int __init init_nmi_devicefs(void)
{
	driver_register(&nmi_driver);
	device_nmi.parent = &device_apic.dev;
        return device_register(&device_nmi);
}
device_initcall(init_nmi_devicefs);
so nmi.c will unconditionally register a device with the local
APIC's device as parent. I strongly suspect this will break if
&device_apic hasn't itself been device_register():d.
The NMI driver's suspend/resume procedures check nmi_active before
doing anything, so registering the NMI device unconditionally
is _probably_ safe. (Although I personally think it should be
conditional.)

Yeah, that's nicer. disable_nmi_watchdog() could easily stash away
the previous state, and enable_nmi_watchdog() could check that copy
and conditionally call setup_apic_nmi_watchdog().
