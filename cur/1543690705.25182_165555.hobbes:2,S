Andries is already gathering info for this one. This problem (missed
key release) happens to me on all systems I have (Athlon + via, P3 + i440BX,
P4 + 845...), most often when I do alt+right-arrow for walking through
consoles (and for Andries: hitting key stops this, otherwise it 
endlessly switches all VTs around, and while kernel thinks that key
is down, keyboard actually does not generate any IRQs, so keyboard knows
that all keys are released).
