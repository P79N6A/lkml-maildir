Theres actually a more interesting difference to notice:
In the working dmesg output I see this:
 > hda: SanDisk SDCFB-128, CFA DISK drive
While in the non working dmesg output we have:
 > hdb: SanDisk SDCFB-128, ATA DISK drive
Tracing back through the code it looks to me like we get the ATA disk 
print in the event that this test in do_identify:
/*
  * Check for an ATAPI device
  */
  if (cmd == WIN_PIDENTIFY) {
that would explain why the drive_is_flashcard test is getting skipped, 
why setting removable is making no difference, and why your card is 
being identified as an ATA device.  It looks as though the WIN_PIDENTIFY 
command is sent down to this routine from ide_probe_for_drive in this 
snip of code:
/* if !(success||timed-out) */
                 if (do_probe(drive, WIN_IDENTIFY) >= 2) {
                         /* look for ATAPI device */
                         (void) do_probe(drive, WIN_PIDENTIFY);
                 }
So it would seem that WIN_PIDENTIFY is issued only if a WIN_IDENTIFY 
command fails with an rc greater than 2.  I would suggest instrumenting 
this area of the code to see what the WIN_IDENTIFY command is returning 
on the working and non-working systems.  I'm betting you will find a 
difference, and we'll be able to track down the problem from there.
