It isn't a pretty sight, but I think it is more important to let the 
"user" know what kind of value to expect from a function/variable.
Then to prevent errors and letting the compiler know it is a boolean, I 
think a globally typedef of _Bool with defined (enum) true/false is a 
good thing.
Just reminded my of the error-prone locally defined MAX/MIN and the 
global max/min.

To 0/1 or false/true?
