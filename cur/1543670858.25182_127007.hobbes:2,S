While you're fixing this part of the interface, can you make the
loop_info64 structure large-file and large-block-device safe?
+struct loop_info64 {
...
+	int		   lo_offset;
	loff_t		   lo_offset;
And for stuff transferred between user/kernel space, it's *usually*
better not to use int or long, but to use explicitly-sized types,
which allows, say, both 32 and 64-bit user spaces on top of 
a 64-bit kernel.
