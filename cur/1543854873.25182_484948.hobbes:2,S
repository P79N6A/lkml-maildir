A bunch of people already started gathering these a day
or so after codesearch launched..
http://asert.arbornetworks.com/2006/10/static-code-analysis-using-google-code-search/
is a good start.
http://www.cipher.org.uk/index.php?p=projects/bugle.project
is also somewhat interesting (but from a security bug standpoint only)
I've got some crufty shell scripts that I grew that I use
from time to time that just grep a bunch of patterns, I've had
"put them all together and make one decent one" on my todo
for a while. I'll see if I can get to it this week.
I've used these occasionally not just to find bugs in the kernel
but across a completely unpacked distro source tree.
Amazing what turns up sometimes.
