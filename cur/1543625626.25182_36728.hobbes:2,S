check the "pr" command:
	pr -m file1 file2
Will format the output in two columns, file1 on the left, file2 on the right.
It doesn't include username, but does have the date (top left) and page number
(top right).
An arbitrary title/heading may be specified with the -h option. The
heading is at the top, center of each page.
I've found that a single column was best based on readability (most source
files will indent so far to the right that only a single column will do).
If you want fancier printing try enscript, this utility allows for 1/2/n
columns. (This one does a nice job for line numbers). The output is
postscript - so options for various fonts and sizes are available.
