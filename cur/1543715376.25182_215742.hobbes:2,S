If everybody (or at least the bigger knots) filters spoofed traffic, this
ceases to be a problem. And that solves a shipload of other problems, so...
If the cracker has access to the connection between routers (quite unlikely
for BGP), there is other, lower-hanging, fun to be had... and in that case
they can just read the exact data from the stream, no guessing needed at
all. And no protection possible either AFAICS.
