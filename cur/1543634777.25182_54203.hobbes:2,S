This is, but there seems to be something more fundamental here. I'm
using the -aa patches, and the static int max_scsi_luns = 8; is actually
static int max_scsi_luns = MAX_SCSI_LUNS;
where above is: #define MAX_SCSI_LUNS 0xFFFFFFFF; 
but I'm not sure if this syntax is 0xFFFFFFFF == 8 or 2^n. 
To me, it seems like 8. I'm using pre10-aa2, I'm going to try pre10-aa4
as well, but if I must I'm going to hard-code the kernel bits I need I
supposed to make static int max_scsi_luns = MAX_SCSI_LUNS; into static
int max_scsi_luns = 16; to ensure it works at the level I need.

Agreed. I've always wondered why one cannot set this by hand, or even
simpler perhaps is a CONFIG_SCSI_MAX_LUN where values are set to one of
small, medium, large?
Thanks much J.W.
