It's userspace.

I'm assuming you're running some sort of Fedora/RHEL/
derivative; this is what you get when you have a device that starts
out named ethX, but which needed to be renamed so that an already
configured ethX could be changed to that name.
For the new device, either add a HWADDR in a ifcfg-ethX file for
that interface, add something to /etc/mactab, or add a udev rule.
