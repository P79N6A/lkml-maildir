OK, stracing this script: 
#!/bin/bash
echo -n "Starting at "
date
while true ; do
  if ! /usr/bin/test `expr 2 + 2` -gt 3 ; then
    echo -n "Error at "
    date
    exit
  fi
done
On this run libc version is 5.3.12 and bash version is 1.14, kernel is
2.2.10ac10 note that the error also occurs with bash version 2.03 and
glibc-2.0
stdout:
Starting at Sun Jul 25 18:19:33 MET DST 1999
expr.sh: Can't reopen pipe to command substitution (fd 5): No child processes
/usr/bin/test: argument expected
Error at Sun Jul 25 22:50:57 MET DST 1999
