This looks fine to me. At some point we _may_ end up with filesystems that
understand about multiple devices, so it's possible in theory that
"get_block()" might return different devices for different blocks, but
that does not happen currently, and I'm not really sure it ever will.
Marcelo, I do believe this should go into 2.4.x too..
