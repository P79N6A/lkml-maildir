If I understand this correctly, you just need a small inflator for
decompression during boot.  There is such a thing that has both small
code and small memory requirements called "puff", which you can find
in zlib's contrib directory.  The only penalty is that it's about half
the speed of zlib's inflate.  But that's still pretty fast.
