That may be the problem, I have "HIGHMEM" enabled. I too have a MoBo
that can handle lots of memory (up to 4GB) and I plan to use it.

I haven't tried the Creative stuff, but I did D/L OSS and it works fine.
In fact, the sound in all my games is better than it was. Only one
problem - if I continue to use the OS driver/module, I have to pay $35
for it (no big deal really, but it is money :)
Maybe I'll give the Creative stuff a try.
