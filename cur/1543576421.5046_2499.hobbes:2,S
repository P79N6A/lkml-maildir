I'm somewhat tired and busy, so I'll post URLs without quoting anything
from them (look at the data in *all* of them, and connect the dots, before
you come to any conclusions). Short version of the story: Some MVP3's
support UDMA-66, some don't -- it depends on the southbridge. 596B & 686A
do, others don't.
