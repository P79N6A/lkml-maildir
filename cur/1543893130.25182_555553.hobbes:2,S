Well, of course it sucks. The question is does it suck less than
adding dozens of new syscalls to patch up problems with POSIX?
I don't think we can get this right in one iteration, so I actually
prefer Linus's approach as less likely to leave numerous vestiges of
incremental improvements around.
On the other hand, we don't want to end up in a future where the bulk
of our calls are through sys_indirect! Given the number of important
APIs that have gotten slight semantic bumps, that's a real
possibility.
