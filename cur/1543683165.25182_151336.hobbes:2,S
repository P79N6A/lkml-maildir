With all the SCO fun going on I have people asking me what functionality
we would loose if we rolled from 2.4.21 kernel to the last known stable
2.2 kernel.
Yes, weathering the lawsuit mess and all is a good plan but I'm still
being asked for this information.  Does anyone have a link listing what
 kind of functionality would be lost, performance impact (p3 and athalon
machines), etc?
