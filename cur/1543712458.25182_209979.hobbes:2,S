What I see is a race.  An application may write through the link outside
both trees before any of the links is marked cow.  With the result
that you don't have a snapshot of your data.

Correct to a point.  And we seem to be imagining the same operations.
However while you will always modify the correct file, as the metadata
is correct.  There is no guarantee that the data will be correct.  The
file will become a cow file only after it is modified or it's
containing directory is modified.  Thus you can have data in the file
that was written after the snapshot operation finished, but before the
individual file itself is marked cow.

Now that you bring it out I see that problem as well.  I have seen it
in other proposed implementations as well.  Keeping hard links linked
requires for some amount of context to be maintained for the entire
copy operation.  If necessary you could keep that context where it is
available to the lazy copy but it is far from trivial. 
In short lazy copying for creating snapshots is dangerous.  The
data you are copying may be modified before you are done.  It is
difficult to maintain state across the entire copy.
All of which sounds like a job for user space to me.
