Subject: Crazy Idea: Replacing /dev using sysfs over time

I wonder if in the future, we can just eliminate /dev altogether (or map it 
via sysfs until older apps move away from /dev). It just seems we could 
represent major,minor in a sysfs node: 
        /sys/class/block/
        `-- sda
            |-- sda1
                    | - major
                    | - minor
                    | - raw
            |-- sda2
                    | - major
                    | - minor
                    | - raw
            `-- sda3
and so forth, or under a different branch elsewhere.
Does it make sense? Logical? Illogical? Do we really need /dev other than for 
historical/legacy purposes?
Shawn.
