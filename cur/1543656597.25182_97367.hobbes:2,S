Dear Linux kernel programmers:
  I use Debian distribution, after some recent update, upgrade, reboot, at
boot time into 2.4.20, it deadlock at pppd link
   What may cause wrong? and in addition fsck /dev/hdc2
what else I should repair it(since fsck is no help at nextboot time dead
lock)
  Highly appreciate your help
Sincere Eric
