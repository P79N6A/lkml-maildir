I had X (Ma64-3.3.3.1 xfree86 server) lock on me last night running 2.3.17
(mouse cursor responsive but that's it).  Kernel may be been fine, as PPP
didn't drop, continued to answer LCP echo requests.  Had to blind-type
Alt-SysRq-B to regain control, then booted to 2.2.12 to FSCK the 9GB of ext2
partitions.  I'm happy to report that during the FSCK, not a single error was
found - not even a block bitmap difference?!
Pitty ATYFB doesn't work with my XPERT-98 (roll of dice as to whether it sets
the pixel clock) or I might have been able to get a useful register dump to
report...
