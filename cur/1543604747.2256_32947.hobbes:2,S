Subject: Tcpdump filters, problem with UDP and 2.4.x

I see a lot of "UDP: bad checksum. ..." between two of my servers.  I 
haven't attached a tcpdump output of the packets because a) the packets 
between machine A and B travel through a GRE tunnel and b) does anyone 
have tcpdump filters or know how to finagle tcpdump into dumping the 
embedded packet instead of the GRE header'd packet?
If not, I'll supply tcpdump output of the traffic.
