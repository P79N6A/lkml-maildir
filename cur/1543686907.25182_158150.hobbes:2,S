I have made a patch set for my laptop which you may like to try. It
mainly contains stuff from -aa and -ac kernels and various other pieces.
See 
http://www.sonarnerd.net/projects/linux/
With this and my backport of latest XFree86 ATI drivers I have Linux
running nicely on my Compaq Evo N1015v and N1020v laptops. At least it
_subjectively_ warms up less and consumes less power under Linux
compared to Windows XP.
