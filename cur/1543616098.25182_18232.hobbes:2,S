I'm open for all cleanups including this. Although I'm not sure about the
right place for shared internal header files. References including the
directory structure layout (like #include "../../generic/ac97/ac97_codec.h")
are not happiest solution in my eyes and creating a new internal directory
with header files definitely breaks the current linux/include directory
structure.
