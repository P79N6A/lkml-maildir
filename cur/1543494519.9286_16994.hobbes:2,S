It only assumes that mmap is available if the mmap() call returns success. 
That's not _too_ unreasonable an assumption.
mmap.c has an optimisation - if it's a zero-length map that's requested, 
return success immediately.
Perhaps if we checked that the filedescriptor has mmap() capability _first_, 
rather than later, the desired effect would be achieved...
