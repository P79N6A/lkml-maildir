You just nicely broke 'find . -name *.c | xargs grep ^foo'.
Why make functions harder to find? It's just one line... Being
able to navigate the source tree with standard unix utils is a
Good Thing.
Even better, IMHO:
void *
foo(void)
{
}
Yes, that takes a full three lines. But within the function body
you can just reverse search for ^{ and you're at the function
declaration. Not nearly as useful as grepping for a function
name, but still a nice thing to have, IMHO.

Agreed.

Agreed.
