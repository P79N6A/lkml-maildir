No, the machine is completely idle. However I switched to the CVS driver (it 
does not work in isochronous mode still), and in bulk-mode it gives me a new 
set of messages:
ATM dev 0: speedtch_read_status: MSG E failed
ATM dev 0: error -110 fetching device status
ATM dev 0: speedtch_read_status: MSG F failed
ATM dev 0: error -110 fetching device status

This seems to happen less often than with the kernel driver, however.
