Are you sure? Last time I checked gcc did a very good job at optimizing
small divisions with small integers, without using div. It just has to 
be a good integer with not too many set bits.

When it is shared with a constant field (like zone index) it shouldn't
matter, no ? At worst you can see outdated data, and when the outdated
data is constant all is fine.

Oops. It was a typo. I meant to write "saving 4 bytes on 64bit"

Ok pity :-/
Hopefully all the "goto out" micro optimizations can be taken out then too,
I recently found out that gcc 2.97's block moving pass has the tendency
to move the outlined blocks inline again ;)
