There are two overlapping mechanisms here
Taint is used to identify situations where debug data may not be good,
that may be proprietary or other dubiously legal code, it may be forcing
SMP active on non SMP suitable systems, it may be overriding certain
options in a potentially hazardous fashion. Taint exists primarily to
help debugging data analysis.
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() is used to assert that the symbol is absolutely
definitely not a public symbol. EXPORT_SYMBOL exports symbols which
might be but even then the GPL derivative work rules apply. When you
mark a driver GPL it is permitted to use _GPL symbols, but if it does so
it cannot then go and load other non GPL symbols and expect people not
to question its validity.
