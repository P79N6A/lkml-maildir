any filesystem benchmark should be informative, namesys tests with a
whole suite, bonnie++, iozone, mongo (custom), and one or two others.
You can ask on reiserfs-list for more information.
I suggest testing against more than one filesystem as well, it's quite
common for a FS to "prefer" one scheduler.
