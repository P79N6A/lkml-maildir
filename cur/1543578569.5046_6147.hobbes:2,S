Don't be silly.
You're entirely ignoring the concept of hardware bugs. Which is one very
likely reason for this whole discussion in the first place.
ANYBODY who does driver development without taking the real world into
account is a dangerous person. Stacks of papers, diagrams and rules are
absolutely WORTHLESS if you can't just understand the fact that
documentation is nothing more than a guide-line.
Once you realize that documentation should be laughed at, peed upon, put
on fire, and just ridiculed in general, THEN, and only then, have you
reached the level where you can safely read it and try to use it to
actually implement a driver.
I'm continually amazed and absolutely scared silly by your blind trust in
paperwork, whether it be standards or committees or vendor documentation.
