As long as the system has a clear idea of how long it will take to resume, it
can schedule a wakeup for a reasonable amount of time before that.  Ideally, a
completely unused system might not need a tick for several seconds.  However,
I agree that it doesn't make sense to add such functionality to the kernel
until someone can show a system that can actually wait that long between
ticks.
