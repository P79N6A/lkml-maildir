From an rpm-based distribution background, it does, actually.
You typically have to install a "xyzzy-devel" package before
you can compile something related to "xyzzy", so it is quite
natural to look for a "kernel-devel" package providing
whatever is necessary to build kernel modules; and
"cd kernel ; make devel-pkg" reads almost literally like
"make kernel-devel.rpm".
