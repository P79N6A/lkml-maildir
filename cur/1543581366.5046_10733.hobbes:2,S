Currently Linux doesn't have any way to figure out which
programs are using a certain physical memory location, so
we cannot efficiently unmap the memory.
And even if we could ... what if the memory is in use by
the kernel itself and there are pointers to those kernel
addresses somewhere else in the kernel ?    These pages
would be unfreeable anyway...

Rik
