We actually have an ABI problem right now because of this.
Note that i386 and x86_64 use different GDT slots.
As far as I can tell, users need to hard-code the mapping
from TLS slot to segment number. They use 0,1,2 to ask the
kernel to set things up (via set_thread_area), but can't
just pop that into %fs or %gs.
So a 32-bit app using set_thread_area can work on i386 or x86_64,
but not both. I guess glibc gets %gs set up free via clone() with
the right flags, and thus does not need to determine the kernel.
For anything involving set_thread_area though, it gets nasty.
Typical hacks that result from this:
call uname() and look for "x86_64"
see of the addresses of local variables exceed 0xbfffffff
examine /proc/1/maps
check for a /lib64 directory
change SSE register 8 in a signal handler frame and see if it sticks
checksum the vdso code
...
Please save us from these foul hacks.
