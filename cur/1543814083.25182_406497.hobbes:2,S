Hi Andrew,
It is preferable to use cpu_down() to shoot down a cpu, but this
function is available only with CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU. If
CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU is not enabled, only other way to shut down slave
CPUs in a state where they would come back up when the new kernel boots
up and sends them IPI is to hold them in a fake rendezvous which is what
the function kexec_stop_this_cpu() does. So the choices are either to
keep both ways of shutting down CPUs or go with kexec_stop_this_cpu()
for all cases.
Thanks for the comments. I will move declarations to header files as you
suggested.
