Yes. The XFS problem should only be triggerable through O_DIRECT and 
non-O_DIRECT mmap at the same time, so the fix for that got pushed back as 
noncritical.
NOTE! I'm still not 100% sure about the older bdb corruption reports. Were 
they just noise due to other issues? Flaky RAM? One report of corruption 
was actually due to running my test-program without enough diskspace, so 
while that confused the issue for a while, it turned out to be a 
non-issue.
So I'm just saying that there might be other things lurking too.
