I have the same system and run into the same problems here. The HD is a
Fujitsu MPD3108AT (10GB ATA33/66 drive, what the machine shipped with)
on hda. Even with the 2.4.21-rc4 kernel, the machine will not boot beyond
the "attached ide-disk driver" message if IDE DMA is compiled in.
Whatever's going wrong doesn't require an older drive to show up.
Let me know how I can help,
