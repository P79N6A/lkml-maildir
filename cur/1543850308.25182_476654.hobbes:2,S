You might need to call ext3_set_bit_atomic() (as claim_block() does,
not sure.

The other issue is that you need to potentially set "num" bits in the
bitmap here, if those all overlap metadata.  In fact, it might just
make more sense at this stage to walk all of the bits in the bitmaps,
the inode table and the backup superblock and group descriptor to see
if they need fixing also.
