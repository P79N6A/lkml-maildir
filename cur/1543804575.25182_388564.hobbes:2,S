To more fully respond though....
Weeks is fine, and better than never.  And there may be cases in which the 
decision has to be made to 'abandon' a particular stable release in favor 
of a newer version because of the difficulty or inability to backport fixes.
I think that it's fine to push the maintenance effort away from the 
mainline developers, probably even desireable, but then the bugfixing/etc 
tends to happen in a disparate manner, off on lots of forks at different 
places without them making their way back to some central place.
And that seems where we're going with this conversation.  A fork/forks at 
various versions to maintain bugfixes and support updates that's (more?) 
open to submitters writing patches.  Maintained by a separate group or 
party, but with the 'blessing' from mainline to do so.  A place for those 
sorts of efforts to be focused, without necessarily involving the primary 
developers.
