Subject: [PATCH] update ver_linux script to work with gcc 3.2.

A commonly used gcc reports its version number thusly:
[steven@spc5 steven]$ gcc --version
2.96
But the new gcc 3.2 reports its version number thusly:
[steven@spc1 scripts]$ gcc --version
gcc (GCC) 3.2 (Mandrake Linux 9.0 3.2-1mdk)

This causes the current ver_linux script to produce less
than readable output for the gcc version when using gcc 3.2.
Here is a patch to the ver_linux script which allows it
to work both with the new gcc and the old gcc. 
The patch was made against 2.4.20-pre4-ac2, but also applies to 
2.4.20-pre4 and to 2.5.32 as well.
This was tested for the gcc 3.2 on Mandrake 9.0 beta4, but
will probably work for Red Hat Limbo or (null).  Testing is
always welcomed.  Backward compatibility with gcc 2.96 was
tested with Red Hat 7.3 and Mandrake 8.2.
