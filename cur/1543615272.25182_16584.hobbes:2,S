It seems as if "Family 4, Model 10" isn't enought, but the Users
Manual describes how to detect an Elan SC4x0 Processor:
3.6 CPU CORE IDENTIFICATION USING THE CPUID INSTRUCTION
The ElanSC400 and ElanSC410 microcontrollers are the first members of
a new family of embedded devices. The CPUID instruction can be used to
identify a processor as belonging to this family.
The Am486 CPU core in the ElanSC400 and ElanSC410 microcontrollers is
the first CPU AMD has made with a write-back cache and no FPU, so
these tests should be sufficient to uniquely identify the family.
Using the CPUID instruction the microcontroller can be done with the
following steps, as shown in the code sample in Section 3.6.3:
    * Make sure the manufacturer name is "AuthenticAMD".
    * Make sure the device is described as a 486 SX1 with a write-back
      cache.  
If it passes all the tests it must be an ElanSC400 microcontroller or
derivative.
If it's worth it or not, I don't know, I'm just curious, it has been
years since I did anything with the Elan processor for real. :-)
