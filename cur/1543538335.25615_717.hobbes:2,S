Same as in test3-pre2 (see my previous message)
Everything compiled fine, with ne2000 built-in support, but could not
get the kernel linked because several (ten) duplicated symbols where
found in network.o and net.o. They are: __kstrtab_NS8390_init,
__ksymtab_ei_close, kstrtab_ei_open, ......., __ksymtab_ethdev_init.
Best,
