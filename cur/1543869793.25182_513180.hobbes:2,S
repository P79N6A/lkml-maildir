I disabled CONFIG_FB_VESA but it is still happening because
intermittent boots don't pump out anything over NetConsole.
It's tempting to think this is a hardware issue but I've been
booting 2.6.20 daily since -rc3 and this hasn't happened before
and still doesn't. I've even installed Asus's latest "beta bios"
(which convenient doesn't come with a changelog) but it had
no effect.
The only thing I can think to do now is another git bisect.
Now I know this occurs on average about every third boot I
could do half a dozen reboots between bisections and hopefully
find out what caused the problem..
Unfortunately I won't have the time for such a time consuming
adventure much the weekend..
Any further ideas?

P.S. You mentioned HPET, is this HPET config normal?
andrew@ziggy ~ $ fgrep -i hpet /usr/src/linux-2.6.21-rc1/.config
CONFIG_HPET_TIMER=y
CONFIG_HPET_EMULATE_RTC=y
# CONFIG_HPET is not set
