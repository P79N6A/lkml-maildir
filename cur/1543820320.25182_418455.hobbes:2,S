Well, it "headset inserted" is a kind of user button...
What is on the jack, BTW? Left headphone, right headphone, mic in? Can
all of them be used independently?

Oops, really? Mechanical switch to sense ac in? (What happens when you
plug in charger but that is not plugged to AC?)
I think that AC presence should be handled independently from
battery. There can be >1 battery in the system.
(Another interesting question is: is AC status 0/1 or is it number of
milivolts?)

Leftover information?
I think we should create directory in sysfs, and populate it according
to battery's capabilities.
Zaurus' battery would have voltage and maybe percent fields.
ACPI battery would have all the usual fields.
Another important question is a way for user applications to avoid
polling... but I guess that should be solveable by enabling select on
one of those files.
