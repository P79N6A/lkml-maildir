The oom killer has no memory of previous kills, so it's not possible to 
determine if there've been a series of recent needless ones.  Subsequent 
oom conditions should still check for intersection and, since it's only a 
heuristic, a large memory-hogging task will eventually be killed if there 
are no tasks remaining with such an intersection.
I don't know how you're planning on mapping large memory allocations on 
nodes of interest back to specific tasks, however.  Do you have a 
proposal?

That's rare, since cpusets are used for NUMA optimizations and a set of 
cpus has a static affinity to certain memory.  It could happen if a 
cpuset's set of allowable nodes is made to be smaller, but that seems like 
it would trigger the oom in the first place and would encourage killing 
tasks with an intersection.
