Similar milo uses kernel drivers in it's own framework.  
This has proved to be a major maintenance problem.  Milo is nearly
a kernel fork.  
The design is for the long term to get this incorporated into the
kernel, and even if not a small kernel patch should be easier to
maintain that a harness for calling kernel drivers.
