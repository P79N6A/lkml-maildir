So mmdrop() inlines to an atomic_dec_and_test on mm_count and a call
to __mmdrop which makes three calls : mm_free_pgd(), destroy_context(),
and free_mm().  I _think_ that in this case __mmdrop() will always get
called.
We know that the destroy_context() is unnecessary, but mm_free_pgd()
and free_mm() are necessary.
I was thinking we _could_ open code these calls in exec.c but that seems
like a "Really Bad Idea" w.r.t abstraction/maintenance etc,
and the alternative is to make another function/macro just for this
special case, which also seems like a poor choice.

Yes, the former does seem easier, and perhaps easiest is to do that
and document what the pre-conditions are so future developers at least
have a clue.
