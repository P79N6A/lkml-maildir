hm.  In some ways I'd prefer to see new
create_singlethread_workqueue_freezer(char *) or whatever, rather than
adding an extra argument.  That's neater, smaller code and
forward-compatible.
But then again, the advantage of breaking the build for unconverted code is
that it makes people think about what their threads should be doing, so
let's go your way.
The one concern I'd have is that $RANDOM_KERNEL_DEVELOPER probably doesn't
have a clue whether or not his kernel thread should be setting PF_NOFREEZE.
What are the guidelines here?
wrt your "Add missing refrigerator support" patch: I'll suck that up, but
be aware that there's a big i2o patch in -mm which basically rips out the
driver which you just fixed up.  Perhaps you can send Markus Lidel
<Markus.Lidel@shadowconnect.com> and I a fix for that version of the driver
sometime?
