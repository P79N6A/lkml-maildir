Subject: [PATCH 0/4] Improve swap page error handling
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Improve the error handling when writes fail to a swap page. 
Currently, the kernel will repeatedly retry the write which is unlikely
to ever succeed. Instead we allow the pages to be unused and then marked
as bad at which prevents reuse. It should hopefully be suitable for
testing in -mm.
These patches are a based on a patch by Nick Piggin and some of my own
patches/bugfixes as discussed on LKML.
