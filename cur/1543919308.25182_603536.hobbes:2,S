i know about 4 (low-impact, cornercase) build breakages for 2.6.23-final 
on x86:
- an uncommon embedded config combinatio: if CONFIG_EMBEDDED=y and
  CONFIG_BLOCK is unset. (a normally useless combination)
- an uncommon V4L config combination: mixed-modular-built-in driver V4L
  config variation. (CONFIG_VIDEO_SAA7146=y and CONFIG_VIDEO_BUF=m)
- an uncommon MTD config combination (normal systems do not need
  CONFIG_MTD configured)
- an uncommon CONFIG_USB_NET_CDC_SUBSET config combination (normal 
  systems should never hit that)
[ furthermore there are a few driver-firmware build options that break 
  and which are not correctly made dependent on !PREVENT_FIRMWARE_BUILD. 
  Again, this is not something one would normally configure. ]
your superblock build failure would be a new and so far unknown build 
breakage variant - please send the .config you used, and double-check 
that it's indeed a vanilla 2.6.23 tree.
