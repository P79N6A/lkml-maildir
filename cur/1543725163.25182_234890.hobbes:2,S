No. Using "def_flags" was a mistake for the whole VM_EXEC thing. It's not 
designed for that, and it doesn't work that way. I applied the paper-over 
fix that gets it almost-working, but I'm waiting for Ingo to rewrite it by 
just saving the "executable_stack" information at exec time, and not 
playing with def_flags at all.
And if somebody else beats him to it, all the more power to that person,
hint hint ;)
