Those allocations could be from _using_ a dma pool ... but they're
not from just creating one!
The cost of creating the dma_pool is the cost of one small kmalloc()
plus (the expensive part) the /sys/devices/.../pools sysfs attribute
is created along with the first pool.  (Use that instead of slabinfo
for those pool allocations.)  That's why the normal spot to create and
destroy dma pools is in driver probe() and remove() methods.
If you want to allocate gobs of other stuff at the same time, that's
your choice ... but it'd be a separate issue.  Cost to create a
dma_pool is significantly less than PAGE_SIZE, and there's no good
reason to allocate or destroy those pools anywhere near an IRQ context.
