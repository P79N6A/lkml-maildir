What do you think journaling is?  <grin>
This is already working.  I'm currently extending ext2fs to call the
joural API to clearly demarkate the beginning and end of each
individual filesystem operation, so that the "patches" (ie. the
journaling transactions) correspond to complete transitions from one
consistent filesystem state to another.
