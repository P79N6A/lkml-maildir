Subject: df output changed between 2.3.49 and 2.3.51: why? bug?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

I tracked down df and found that in 2.3.49 it complely hides virtual
filesystems, but in 2.3.51 they are shown, thusly:
Filesystem           1k-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/hda2              4087584   2755592   1124352  71% /
none                 4294967295 4294967295         0 100% /proc
/dev/hda5              2470374   1898333    444326  81% /home
none                 4294967295 4294967295         0 100% /dev/pts
none                   4194304         0   4194304   0% /var/shm
Does someone want me to find exactly where this change happened, or is it
known, or what?  It looks untidy to me ;) I like to just see real mounts
with df :)
My df version: df (GNU fileutils) 4.0
