Been running for a bit over an hour under (relatively) heavy load.
Dual PII 350,
2.4.21-ac2 compile,
tridge's fstest.c (samba.org/ftp/unpacked/junkcode/fstest.c) in various
configurations
cp -rl linux-2.5.72 linux-2.5.73
patch to 2.5.73
all on XFS partition (/ is ext3, /home (where i work) is xfs)
all going okay (i.e. no weirdness) and tests passed.
so if anything is wrong, it's at least a (bit) obscure :)
