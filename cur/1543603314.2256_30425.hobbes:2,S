I just uploaded v0.99.4 (a bugfix only release) of Powertweak,
the hardware configuration/tuning tool to
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=253
v0.99.3 announced a few days ago had quite a few problems,
which this release fixes. As well as those documented below
there have been various fixes to get the code building on
various strange glibc/gcc/autoconf's
This stands a much greater chance of working than the
previous release, which I'll now pretend never happened.
v0.99.4 [Release 22. -- The 'Bug Barbecue' release ]
- Bugfixes:
  - 'Disk' Submenu works again.
  - CPU backend cleanups.
    - Was using memory after free()
    - 'BrandName' field removed, and CPUName field improved.
    - CPU Name can now be any length. 
    - Now cleans identity structure prior to use. 
  - hdparm backend got an overdue cleanup.
    - tweaks no longer carry excess ioctl info.
    - allocation routines made simpler.
  - Only 'Tree' elements of the tree are now sorted. 
  - When backends failed, we were dereferencing freed memory. 
  - Sonypi backend now unloads if no Sonypi hardware present.
  - PCI backend tried to read past byte 255 of config space.
