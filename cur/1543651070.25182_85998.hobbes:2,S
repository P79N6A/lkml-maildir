Marc,
I'd like to see LKCD (aka Linux Kernel Crash Dumps) and e2compr in your mcp
tree. The first may not be such
a big problem (getting them to work with kdb2.4 might be bit taunting) the
latter probably needs to be ported. Checked out WOLK3.7 and it works great!
Thanx in advance!
Best regards,
	Pascal
