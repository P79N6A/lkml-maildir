381 One of the best ways to put into practice your hacking skills is by fixing
382 bugs reported by other people. Not only you will help to make the kernel
383 more stable, you'll learn to fix real world problems and you will improve
384 your skills, and other developers will be aware of your presence. Fixing
385 bugs is one of the best ways to earn merit amongst the developers, because
386 not many people like wasting time fixing other people's bugs.
