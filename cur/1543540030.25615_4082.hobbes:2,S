Please, if it goes in /lib then /lib/modules/include.
But instead, how about a script: /lib/modules/VERSION/compile-module.
The script would know where to find the kernel headers.  That could be
/lib/modules/include for distributions, and /my/kernel/tree/include for
folks who used `make modules_install' recently.
Even better, the script has the ability to add multiple include paths,
so that you get the right SMP/UP-specific config.h but don't have to
have two copies of the unchanged headers.
Distributions can change the script if they want to control where the
relevant headers are installed.  They'd probably set the location to
/usr/src/linux-DISTVERSION/include/linux or
/lib/modules/DISTVERSION/include according to their preference.  And
they might want to do the subtarget-specific config.h thing.
Here's a first stab at one a distro might use:
#!/bin/sh
KERNEL_CONFIG=/lib/modules/2.2.14-12/include
KERNEL_HEADERS=/usr/src/linux-2.2.14/include
gcc -O2 -I$KERNEL_CONFIG_HEADERS -I$KERNEL_HEADERS -c "$@" ;;
And one installed by doing `make modules_install' in /home/jamie/kernel/v2.4
#!/bin/sh
gcc -O2 -I/home/jamie/kernel/v2.4 -c "$@" ;;
You get the idea,
enjoy,
