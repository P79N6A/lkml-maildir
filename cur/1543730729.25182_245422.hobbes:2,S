Stupid question: who will use it? And why?
Anyone can write an userspace library, that implements function
set_attribute(char *file, char *attribute, char *value), that creates
directory ".attr/file" in file's directory and stores attribute there.
(and you can get list of attributes from shell too:
ls `echo "$filename" |sed 's/\/\([^\/]*\)$/\/\.attr\/\1/'`
). There's no need to add extra functionality to kernel and filesystem.
Advantage:
- you don't add bloat to kernel or filesystem
- you don't need to teach tar/cp -a/mc about attributes
- you won't lose attributes after editing file in vim (it creates another
file and renames it over original one)

The only way xattrs are useful is that backup/restore software doesn't
have to know about every filesystem with it's specific attributes and
every magic ioctl for setting them. Instead it can save/restore
filesystem-specific attributes without understanding what do they mean.
However there's no need why application should use them. And no
application does.
I can't imagine anyone shipping an application with "this app requires
reiser4" prerequisite. Why should anyone use it if he can store attributes
in ".attr" directory or whereever and make the application work on any OS
and any filesystem?
