Please don't reference mem_map[] directly outside of #ifdef
CONFIG_FLATMEM areas.  It is not defined for all config cases.  Please
use pfn_to_page(), instead.  It should work in all cases where the page
is valid.
Also, instead of keeping addr defined like you do, and comparing it
during each run of the loop, why not just use pfn_is_nosave(), which is
already defined?  Then, you won't even need the variable.
