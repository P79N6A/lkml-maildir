Well, you are right that Rafael did some quite serious reviewing of
latest incarnation... OTOH you got some pretty big comments ("may not
use /proc") that were not included, yet (and will need big changes),
so it is not really reviewed, either. (Certainly swsusp in-kernel code
got more reviewing over the years).
