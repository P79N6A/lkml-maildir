I once liked those things, too - but I've learned better since.
Quoting _Handbook_of_Algorithms_and_Data_Structures_ (Gonnet/Baeza-Yates,  
ISBM 0-201-41607-7, Addison-Wesley):

3.3.1 Practical hashing functions
[...]
A universal class of hashing functions is a class with the property that  
given any input, the average performance of all the functions is good.  
[...] For example, h(k) = (a * k + b) mod m with integers a != 0 and b is  
a universal class of hash functions.
[...]
Keys which are strings or sequences of words (including those which are of  
variable length) are best treated by considering them as a number base b.  
Let the string s be composed of k characters s1s2...sk. Then
        h(s) = ( sum(i=0..k-1) B^i*s(k-i) ) mod m
To obtain a more efficient version of this function we can compute
        h(s) = ( ( sum(i=0..k-1) B^i*s(k-i) ) mod 2^w ) mod m
where w is the number of bits in a computer word, and the mod 2^w  
operation is done by the hardware. For this function the value B = 131 is  
recommended, as B^i has a maximum cycle mod 2^k for 8<=k<=64.
Hashing function for strings
        int hashfunction(s)
        char *s;
        { int i;
          for(i=0; *s; s++) i = 131*i + *s;
          return(i % m);
        }
--- snip ---
I've actually used that function for a hash containing something like a  
million phone numbers as keys, and there were *very* few collisions.  
Similarly for another hash containgng megabytes of RFC 822 message-ids.
