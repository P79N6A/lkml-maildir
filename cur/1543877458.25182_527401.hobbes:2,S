Subject: [PATCH -mm] fix jiffies clocksource inittime

Andrew,
	In debugging a problem w/ the -rt tree, I noticed that on systems that
mark the tsc as unstable before it is registered, the TSC would still be
selected and used for a short period of time. Digging in it looks to be
a result of the mix of the clocksource list changes and my clocksource
initialization changes.
With the -rt tree, using a bad TSC, even for a short period of time can
results in a hang at boot. I was not able to reproduce this hang w/
mainline, but I'm not completely certain that someone won't trip on it.
This patch resolves the issue by initializing the jiffies clocksource
earlier so a bad TSC won't get selected just because nothing else is yet
registered.
thanks
-john
