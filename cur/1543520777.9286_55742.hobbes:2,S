08 is the device major number.  I happen to know this is SCSI :-)
0a is the device minor number.  ls /dev/sda* tells me that minor 10
( == 0x0a) is /dev/sda10.
There are some other possibilities that stop it mounting your partition;
things like ensuring that you have support for SCSI hard discs (some people
might only have SCSI tape drives and no discs, for example).  It may be
worth you posting your .config. (grep [my] .config)
