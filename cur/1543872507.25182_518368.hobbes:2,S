Well, strictly speaking it's a warning, not an oops per se. 
What happens is that the quirk wants to do an "ioremap_nocache()", which 
allocates memory, and that happens very early during initialization when 
interrupts are disabled.
And you're really not supposed to allocate memory, except using 
GFP_ATOMIC. But we've always been lax about that during early boot, so we 
have stuff that does. And resume ends up doing a lot of the same things 
early boot does, and shows issues like this.
So the quirk is probably still a good idea, and the warning message is 
just that - a very scary warning message, but not an indicator that 
anything is seriously screwed up for you.
(It is an indication of a real bug, though, even though it's harmless in 
practice in this case)
