I don't understand why you can't share this code.  The main reason for
having different types is so you don't mix them up -- they are
separante namespaces, and shouldn't be mixed up.  Having them be
different types makes the compiler enforce this.
If we were using C++ we could make a base class which contained the
common stuff.  As it is, perhaps a substructure would do it.
