Two weeks ago I would have been more convinced of this argument. But
after hearing DaveM talk about networking scalability, I'm becoming
convinced that blocking is *right*, and non-blocking or asynchronous
I/O is the wrong approach.
Using blocking I/O and a thread per connection means that we can push
input packet processing into the process execution context. And that
in turn means we can scale our network stack far beyond what anyone
else is doing. There's some fascinating stuff that Dave and Linus are
working on here. And it looks like it ties in very nicely with TCP's
anti-congestion algorithms.
The main downside that I can see is the requirement to support large
numbers of threads. The current limits are being worked on. After
that, the main issue I see is the resource usage of tens of thousands
of threads, particularly with the kernel stack per thread. And I think
we can solve that problem too.
