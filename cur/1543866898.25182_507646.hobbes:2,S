Subject: [RFC PATCH] QRCU fastpath optimization
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/11/262

This patch optimizes the "quick" RCU update-side fastpath, so that in the
absence of readers, synchronize_qrcu() does four non-atomic comparisons
and three memory barriers, eliminating the need to acquire the global
lock in this case.  Lightly tested.  Algorithm has been validated for
the 3-reader-2-updater and 2-reader-3-updater cases -- 3-readers-3-updaters
case still to be done (I expect to get access to a large-memory machine
in the next few weeks -- need >>20GB).
Not for inclusion.  Patch is against Oleg's original patch, and likely
needs to be rediffed against Jen's patchstack.  I will do this rediffing
later, first want an easy-to-test and easy-to-inpect version.
