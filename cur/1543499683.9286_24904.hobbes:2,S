well, i agree with you here. One way to measure this is to compare the
stripped binary sizes of cc1 vs. vmlinux, correct?
the size of egcs i have is:
-rw-r--r--   1 mingo    mingo     1303736 Jun 19 11:35 cc1
a stripped vmlinux is:
-rwxrwxr-x   1 mingo    mingo     1382164 Jun 19 11:42 vmlinux
so it's about on the same level.

I _know_ that hacking egcs is incredibly complex and challenging, i
respect the egcs project and gcc hackers _alot_. I was protesting against
comparing gcc and the kernel directly by comparing code complexity. Linux
has very subtle complexities as well, not present in gcc. One of the
reasons why we try to keep Linux as simple as physically possible is the
fact that unnecessery complexities will come back and haunt us later by
slowing down development, reducing performance and increasing the number
of bugs - but it must be understood that this simplicity is a conscious
choice and should not be mistaken for being inferior. The same amount of
'unnecesserily complex new code' hits Linux considerably harder than GCC.
