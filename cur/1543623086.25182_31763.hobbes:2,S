TRUE should be defined in /usr/include/ncurses/ncurses.h, like this
/* XSI and SVr4 specify that curses implements 'bool'.  However, C++ may also
 * implement it.  If so, we must use the C++ compiler's type to avoid conflict
 * with other interfaces.

#undef TRUE
#define TRUE    1
#undef FALSE
#define FALSE   0
