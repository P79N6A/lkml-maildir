Is this on a 2.6 kernel? I have similar problems between two 2.6
machines, but haven't investigated it much yet.
Both systems work well as a client. My home server running 2.6 is
NTP server to the rest of the network at home. A 2.4 machine can
sync its time, but a 2.6 machine can't. The 2.6 client can sync
to the public ntp servers on the internet.
(this is all IIRC)
