2.6 also has the same restriction. But, if the "filesystem 
blocksize alignment" (soft block size) fails, we try to see 
if its aligned with hard sector size (512). If so, we can do the IO.
2.4 fails if the offset or buffer is NOT filesystem blocksize
aligned. Period.
So, its possible that your buffer is atleast 512byte aligned,
there by succeeding on 2.6
BTW, posix_memalign() or valloc() should be safe.
