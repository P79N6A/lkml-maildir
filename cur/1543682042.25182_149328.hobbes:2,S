But why do you need a 32bit interface to the kernel when a
32:32 interface exists? Userland can translate 32 bit major/minor
into 32:32 to the kernel, if a 64 bits syscall exists, right 
CAse in point: mknod64()
Same goes for filesystems. A 32 bit on-disk rdev doesn't need to
be handled by the rest of the kernel. The filesystem driver just
needs to translate it to 32 major 32 minor for the rest of the
kernel.
