Hi,
I just ported a project from 2.3.26 to 2.3.39 and I'm witnessing
a strange request effect. Doing
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/cdrw bs=2048 count=32
I was relieing on the ll_rw_block layer to correctly handle
request merging and this was fine in 2.3.26. I would receive
a single clustered request. In 2.3.39 I actually get two requests,
one with the first block and a second with the remaining merged.
Surely this isn't the intended effect. Comments?
