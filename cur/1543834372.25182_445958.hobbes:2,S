Yes, it's better to stop this thread. Because you haven't done your
homework and advocating procedure which will create massive spurious changes
every time it's applied.
If you have math background:
	Lindent \cdot Lindent \neq Lindent

OOhhhh, please do
	find . -type f -name '*.[ch]' | xargs ./scripts/Lindent
on any large C codebase.

Start fixing indent(1) if you're serious about all this. There are
_plenty_ of C code flying around.
