If you're really sure this works .. then it looks OK.  However, I
thought weak was a linker attribute, not a compiler one.  How does the
compiler know if the static inline needs to be incorporated or if a
strong symbol is going to override it when the whole thing is linked
together at the time it just compiles main.c?

I'll give it a whirl tomorrow when I get access to one of the voyager
systems in Columbia.
