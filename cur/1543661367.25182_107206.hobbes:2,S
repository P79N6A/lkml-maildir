Voltage scaling. Yes, it's widespread. I was referring to an additional
capability to lower voltage while the CPU is sleeping. But I digress.
But this whole thread didn't start as a discussion of voltage scaling,
it started as a discussion of throttling - e.g. keeping your system at
1400MHz 1.550V and simulating a slower processor by toggling the STPCLK#
pin. And you're exactly right that no you *wouldn't* want to do that.
I think we are in agreement. ;-)
