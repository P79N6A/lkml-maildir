Hard real time is more than scheduling. Not only do you have to schedule
real time tasks within boundaries (and on an RTOS refuse to allow
a configuration where a time boundary cannot be met) you also have to
guarantee that you can complete any specific time constrained event within
that timeperiod _regardless_ of the state of the rest of the system.
Thus for example if you wake a real time task and it cannot activate because
its sleeping on a buffer that some other low priority task owns temporarily
you just lost the game.
