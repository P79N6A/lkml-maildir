Sure,
  config MAX_RT_PRIO
     int "Maximum RT priority (DANGEROUS!)"

I've wondered this too, especially when customers ask for more.  I never
question them (don't bite the hand that feeds you), but I really think
that they like to prioritize things by 10.  So you go from 10 20 30
instead, leaving room in between incase you forget something. Kind of
like the old BASIC programming days with line numbers.
There's also the case that you have groups of tasks that are all higher
in priority than other groups.  But the tasks themselves have priorities
with each other.  So you group the tasks in a range where they are
greater than or less then other task groups.  And then you can arrange
the tasks yourself.  But this all gets quite complex and then leads to
more custom kernels :-)
