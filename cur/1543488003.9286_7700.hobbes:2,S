Did you really tried the exploit? I connect to the server (that is
sleeping) and _then_ I always close the socket, so the file descriptor
gets released, but the newsk in CONNECTING state is still allocated
awating for a server action. The DoS is that there's no limit in the
number of these peer-newsk. Do you see my point?
