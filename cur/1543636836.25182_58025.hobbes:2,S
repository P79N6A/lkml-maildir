Maybe it is an option to add the --I_know_Im_stupid option to the swapoff
command line ? (Also known as the --force flag). This way we can both
return an error when the OS lacks memory and force a swapoff.
Agreed, the system is practically dead when no allocations will succeed,
but maybe killing user tasks when root needs memory or something is an
option... (Better a few angry users than a crashed server, besides, it is
not something that should happen every day)
