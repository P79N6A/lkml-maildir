*ROTFL*
Excuse me, what sort of atomicity are you talking about?  If that "program"
pokes around in kernel memory and accesses (nevermind how found) in-core
inodes, it's not just not atomic, it's obviously racy in all sorts of
interesting ways.  struct inode can be freed at any point _and_ userland
code can lose timeslice and not regain it in quite a while.
If any backup program tries to pull that off, I would really like to see
the names of its "designers" posted for public ridicule.  If such duhvelopers
actually exist, they more than deserve recognition.
