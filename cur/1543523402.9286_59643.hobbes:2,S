But sys_open does lock_kernel(), filp_open(), unlock_kernel().
file_open drives module_init etc.  All the module initialization should
be running under the big kernel lock, the second open should suspend
until the first one completes.  If we are seeing races then something
is dropping the kernel lock at the wrong place or not reaquiring it
correctly.
