Yes, DRIVE_TASK is of course the official name - I just knew you would
immediately recognize *_AEB  & and know context/usage :)   BTW, if you
didn't want it in an official kernel, it is a bit late for that. It has
been in for some time in 2.4 .... <grep>  2.3.99pre9 to be exact.

Please see above - I agree, and was suggesting a small patch to 2.2 
rather than the massive one (which Alan already ruled out months ago).

This is a valid point - in an ideal situation things should just work
without user intervention or setmax util, etc.  What are you currently
recommending to 2.2.x kernel users that come across this limitation
prior to such an ideal fix being released in a 2.2.x kernel?
Paul.
