Subject: [PATCH] 2.6.9 ide-probe and indentical old disks.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

It seems that some old disks don't have a serial number, but ide-probe
now compares serial numbers to determine if a slave disk is just a
ghost image of the primary.  This breaks old hardware that has two
identical model disks which don't report serial numbers.  The fix seems
as simple as checking for zero length serial numbers before comparing.
