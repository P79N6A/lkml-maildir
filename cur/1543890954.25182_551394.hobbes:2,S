Hey all,
I altered Karuna's cref tool to print the number of seconds it would
take to check the cross-references for a chunk.  The results look good
for chunkfs: on my laptop /home file system and a 1 GB chunk size, the
per-chunk cross-reference check time would be an average of 5 seconds
and a max of 160 seconds in 2013.  This is calculated assuming average
seek time and rotational latency delay for every cross-reference
checked; some simple batching of I/Os could significantly improve
that.
The tool is a little dodgy on error handling and other edge cases ATM,
but for now, here's the results and the code (attached):
val@nifty:~/chunkfs/cref_new$ sudo ./cref.sh /dev/hda3 dump /home 1024

Average cross references per group = 439
Maximum cross references in a group = 13997
Max group is 4 (0:3, 1:46, 2:282, 3:4996, 5:8445, 6:2, 7:1, 8:27, 9:1, 10:2, 12:1, 13:51, 14:32, 15:99, 16:2, 17:5, 18:2, )
