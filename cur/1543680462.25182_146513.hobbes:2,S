Subject: raw1394_loop_iterate hangs with 2.4.21

Hello,
after installing the 2.4.21 kernel I have the following problem:
My computer hangs, when I press the exit button (of the window 
decoration) during raw1394_loop_iterate is running (mouse pointer dosn't 
move, keyboard dons't react, ...)
This happens in a small GTK 1.2 programm for capturing images form a
dcam. raw1394_loop_iterate is called by an idle function (gtk_idle_add).
That means the computer does not always hang, only when
raw1394_loop_iterate is running durning pressing the exit button
(probability approx. 50%) When it hangs, the function connected with the
"destroy" signal (gtk_signal_connect ...) is never reached.
Versions:
Linux: 2.4.31
libraw: 0.9.0
gtk: 1.2.10
X (don't laugh): 3.3.4
Computer: Tyan S2466 with 2 x Athlon 1533 MHz + 2 GB RAM (SMP and
Highmem support)
Any suggestions? Do you need more info (.config file)?
Regards Stefan
