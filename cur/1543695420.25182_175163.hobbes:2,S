These "JIT" is needed also for another reason: 
	There are contraints for GPU commands and the pipelines need to
	be modelled, like CPU piplines are modelled in a compiler. But
	more like the pipelines of some early long instruction word
	processors, where issuing to a used pipeline will cause random
	behavior and crashes. So the JIT doesn't should also emit
	synchronization points. 
With this JIT in place, there need to be just some hardware description
files (backends) and some API (GL, DirectX, X) description files
(frontends).
Now we just need some funding for that and the datasheets. Then it's
doable.
I see just one showstopper: Cheating in benchmarks isn't possible anymore.
PS: That's basically the GGI approach taken further.
