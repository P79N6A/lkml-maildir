Hi
	I'm trying to... I have just been busy recently... first I was
taking exams on polytechnic... then I played heavily with my VIA trying
to discover 80-c bit -> instead I found out few other bits, screwed my
FS completly twice and came to conlusion that there is no way on VIA to
get info about cable type ;) and then I left my home for 8 days to have
some rest... end of boring story.
Now I'm back and will make ide.2.2.17pre13.20000711.patch soon...
Right now there is 
http://republika.pl/ide.2.2.17pre6.20000619.patch.bz2
I got used to the fact that my messages are "missed"...
but could you at least tell me what do you think about
	1). generic ATA tuning
	2). ide-info and moving all these /proc/ide/chipset to userland
	    (right now it requires root priviliges but next version
	     will use /proc/ide/ide0/config)
	3). rewritten amd7409.c (clone of Vojtech's via82cxxx.c)
	    (no f*ck*ng feedback, people with amd7409 don't like
	     /proc info and overclocking?)
Cheers...
