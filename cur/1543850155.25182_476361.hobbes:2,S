What about shifting the requirement down to the platform? Ie on ia64
it would seem that inb/outb already solve this problem via mf.a.
All platforms that support inb/outb correctly must have a
synchronizing primitive for outb..

I'm not sure that can work either. The PCI-X spec is very clear, you
must wait for a non-posted completion if you care about order. Doing a
config read in the driver as a surrogate flush is not good enough in
the general case. Like you say, a pci bridge is free to reorder all
in flight non-posted operations.
