The report appears to be about the earlier patch not the one I did from
reading it. That said I don't see it matters which. 
The only way to track down any remaining ones is to go line by line
through the PCI configuration and understand what we or the bios mixed up
so its pretty tedious but doable assuming the bug isn't in the SATA
driver in the first place. The IRQ routing on the later chips is pretty
rigid so its not too hard to spot a misconfiguration.
