I had sent a patch for this earlier ... Adrian, did you try (build + boot +
testrun) with it? Does this one go away (and system executes fine)?

drivers/video/pvr2fb.c is a mess with __init, __initdata, __devinit and
__devinitdata (__exit and __devexit variants for good measure) all being
used and referencing each other freely ... I have no idea what function
should actually be what. Sam normally knows about such things,
adding him to Cc: list.

These warnings are most likely bogus (still good to get rid of them,
of course).
BTW, in include/asm-sh/machvec_init.h, __initmv is:
__attribute__((__section__(".machvec.init")))	/* .machvec.init */
But from arch/sh/kernel/vmlinux.ld.S the name of the section is:
__machvec_start = .;
.init.machvec : { *(.init.machvec) }		/* .init.machvec */
__machvec_end = .;
Am I obtuse, or is there something weird about this?
