I guess, reasoning behind Solaris design was that you have to disable
interrupts during critical sections more frequently than they would
actually block in them. So, you lose on interrupt thread creation and
when interrupts really block on a lock, but you gain because there is no
more need to disable interrupts when accessing data shared between
interrupt handler and the rest of the kernel. This can ultimately amount
to some net advantage especially when coupled with some sort of lazy
interrupt thread creation.

Reiserfs also likes to keep BKL while doing binary searches within nodes
of a tree.
