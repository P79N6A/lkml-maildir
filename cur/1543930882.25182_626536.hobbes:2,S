The original point was that urandom draws entropy from random, and that 
it is an an inobvious and unintentional drain on the entropy pool. At 
least that's how I read it. I certainly have programs which draw on 
urandom simply because it's a convenient source of meaningless data. I 
have several fewer since this discussion started, though, now that I 
have looked at the easy alternatives.
