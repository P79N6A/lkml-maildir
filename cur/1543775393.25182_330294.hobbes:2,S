Structured files are fine when they're small but quickly become
disgusting as they get bigger.  Either you slowly rewrite the whole
thing or you "fast save" by writing new sections to the end of it that
replace existing sections.  That's how you end up with documents that
contain "deleted" information that was supposed to be confidential.
Having the filesystem track each part for you and then creating a
structured file when needed (and without needing to remember to run a
special tool) is a far better idea.  (reiser4 doesn't do this but its a
possible idea)
Another advantage to file-as-directory is being able to access all the
file's meta-data through a single channel: file names and text data.
It removes the need for chmod, chown, touch, getxattr, chacl and all the
rest of the special tools needed to work with Unix files.  It also makes
it far easier to add new meta-data in the future, because no new tools
have to be written to use it.
So that's two reasons to bother.
