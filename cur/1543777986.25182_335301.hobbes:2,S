You don't want tmpfs. You want either (1) ramfs and copy the data once at
boot time or (2) any filesystem and mmap and lock which will read the data
every time your app starts. 
Tmpfs is backed by swap so other system activity will potentially cause some of
the file to go to swap which kills your latency spec.
