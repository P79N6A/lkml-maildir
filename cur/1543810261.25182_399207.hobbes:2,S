That only makes sense as long as you have a common source code for both
that also is under your control. As soon as the driver enters the mainline
kernel, it is no longer helpful to have these checks in it, because other
people will start making changes to the driver that you don't want to
have in the 2.6.5 version.
You cannot avoid forking the code in the long term, but fortunately the
need to backport fixes to the old version should also decrease over time.
