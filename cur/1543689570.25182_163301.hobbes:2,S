NFS ?
The problem with OpenGFS is that it is a network file system so
implementing "perfect" shared mmap semantics might actually reduce it
from handy to useless. Right now the worst we have to do is mark pages
uncached in some weird shared map cases, with pages being bounced across
firewire its a bit different.
