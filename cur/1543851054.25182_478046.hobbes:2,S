I can certainly see scenarios where we would want to keep "empty" 
beancounters around.
For instance, I move all the tasks out of a group but still want to be 
able to obtain stats on how much cpu time the group has used.
Maybe we can do that without persisting the actual beancounters...I'm 
not familiar enough with the code to say.
