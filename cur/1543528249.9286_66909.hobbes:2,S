ELF and better (I hope) SMP support:
ftp://icaftp.epfl.ch/pub/people/almesber/misc/bootimg-5.tar.gz
bootimg(8) can now also load ELF executables, e.g. linux/vmlinux
The second major change is that I'm using some of the SMP detection
code on non-SMP systems to reserve pages where the BIOS has put SMP
configuration tables. This way, a non-SMP kernel booting an SMP
kernel won't overwrite them. It would be good if the SMP gurus
could have a look at it and tell me what they think of my changes.
