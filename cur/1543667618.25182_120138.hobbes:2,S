A great idea, we'd need to use this struct user_space at every
system call, and it doesn't work to well when pointers are
embedded inside of a structure.
This is why a GCC attribute of some sort would be more useful.
But I don't see the GCC folks offering a user-definable attribute
+ checking system any time soon.
