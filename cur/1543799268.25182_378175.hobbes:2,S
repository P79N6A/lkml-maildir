Sorry for noise, probably I should just re-read your explanation
tomorrow after some sleeping...
But why we can't add the waiter to ->wait_list _after_ xchg() ?
What makes the difference? Fastpath atomic op can happen before
or after xchg(), this is ok. Unlock path will look at ->wait_list
only after taking spinlock, at this time we already added this
waiter to the ->wait_list.
In other words: we are holding ->wait_lock, nobody can even look
at ->wait_list. We can add the waiter to ->wait_list before or
after atomic_xchg() - it does not matter.
Again no?
Oleg.
