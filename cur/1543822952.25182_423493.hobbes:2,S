Incorrect.  The FAQ stated that BSD4.3 and SunOS support executable
shell scripts, but both BSD 4.3 and SunOS required that the shell
scripts be readable.  I know, I've personally worked on BSD 4.3
systems and worked on BSD 4.3 source.  Read the FAQ more carefully....
Let's try this on Solaris:
1% uname -a
SunOS all-night-tool.mit.edu 5.10 Generic_118822-26 sun4u sparc
2% cat > test-exe
#!/bin/sh
echo "This is a test of a non-readable shell script"
3% chmod 111 test-exe
4% ls -l test-exe
   2 ---x--x--x   1 tytso    mit           63 May 13 08:56 test-exe*
5% ./test-exe
./test-exe: ./test-exe: cannot open
6% chmod 755 test-exe
7% ./test-exe
This is a test of a non-readable shell script
Any other questions?
