Not really, someone needs to put a bloody comments in that patch ;-)
The key is that load balance scans from lowest SMT domain and traverse
upwards to numa allnodes domain.  The CPU check and break is placed at
the end of the for loop so it is effectively shorting out i+1 iteration.
And given the fact that sd->span in iteration(i) is the same as sd->groups
in iteration(i+1).  The patch is effectively designate first CPU (hard-coded)
in a group within a domain to perform load balance in that domain.  All
other groups within a domain will still have at least one CPU assigned to
perform load balance.
Though the original patch is not perfect:
(1) we should extend the logic to all rebalance tick, not just busy tick.
(2) we should initiate load balance within a domain only from least
    loaded group.
(3) the load scanning should be done only once per interval per domain.
    Currently, it is scanning load for each CPU within a domain.  Even with
    the patch, the scanning is cut down to one per group. That is still
    too much.  Large system that has hundreds of groups in numa allnodes
    will end up scanning / calculate load over and over again. That should
    be cut down as well.
Part of all this problem probably stemmed from "load balance" is incapable
of performing l-d between arbitrary pair of CPUs, and tightly tied load scan
and actual l-d action.  And on top of that l-d is really a pull operation
to current running CPU. All these limitations dictate that every CPU somehow
has to scan and pull.  It is extremely inefficient on large system.
IMO, we should decouple load scan from actual l-d action and if possible,
make l-d capable of performing on arbitrary pair of CPUs.
