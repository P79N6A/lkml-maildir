I looked for "RedHat / Red Hat". Not for "linux community members". 
That's what I wrote.
I didn't look for "Microsoft employees that contribute to RFC's under
their own names" either.
The original statement was

"Microsoft making 370 times more than RedHat says _nothing_ about
their actual achievement in terms of software development."
--- cut --
BTW: Microsofts' contributions to RFCs has to me the same "face value"
as IBMs' contributions to the Linux kernel. It is an small piece of IP
( :-) ) given to get lots of leverage for closed/proprietary stuff.
