	Grrrr, indeed. I tripped over that stuff when I tried to separate
fs-dependent part of inode from inode itself (ext2; works). It also screws
NTFS folks. It also adds uglyness to FAT-derived filesystems and NFS.
Pity that I noticed it too late and those who've met this bug before just
added bandaids instead of fixing the thing. Please, surround the
placeholder with #if LINUX_VERSION_CODE < 0x20300 and
#else
#error Fix the FIFO stuff
#endif
so that it would scream and shout in 2.3, OK?
