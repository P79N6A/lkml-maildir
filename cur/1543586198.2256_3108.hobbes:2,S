So AIX is buggy in eager mode not reserving a couple of extra pages [per
process] to be able to run the handler. What AIX version(s) you use?
Anyway, as you probably noticed at present I'm not a big supporter of
introducing SIGDANGER, too many things can be messed up for little
or no gain.

And this. Moreover it shouldn't be malicious, people write happily
sighandlers that would blowup thing even without they realise ...
And admin still have no control over the things ;) Sure it could be
worked around these but I feel it just doesn't worth for the added
complexity.

This is my question as well ;) Although I didn't read the AIX source but
guessed kernel sets a bit in the task structure for eager mode during
the exec() syscall and takes care about everything, at least this is
what the document suggests ;) [see the bottom of the page]
