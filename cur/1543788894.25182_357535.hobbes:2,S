Yes and limited by it and the boot protocol. And changing that CONFIG
wont' change that. IMHO this config is highly misleading.

It's a bad idea to have a CONFIG for every buffer. If we go down this way
this way we end up with a unconfigurable kernel at some point with
hundreds of obscure parameters. Just increase it if there is a need for it.
If you're really worried about memory consumption you can
make the big buffer __initdata and copy it to a newly allocated buffer of the 
right size.
