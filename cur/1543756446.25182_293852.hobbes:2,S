When a CPU-hungry task freezes another one for more than 13 seconds, I cannot
agree with your last statement, and that's why I still don't upgrade. I have
already posted examples of worst case scenarios, but I now start to have a
more meaningful example to show so that people working on the scheduler may
have something clearer to work with. I also did not have time to retest -ck
or staircase recently, but I will do for completeness.

I still know about a tens of 2.2 still running around at customers ;-)
However, if it had not been for lazyness, they should have upgraded.
Cheers,
