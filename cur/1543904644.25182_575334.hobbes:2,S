Yeah, I really shouldn't have applied that patch. I didn't notice that it 
not only cleaned up the direct memcpy's, it also re-introduced the damn 
broken code that we fixed once already.
Dammit, that read-only debug support IS NOT WORTH THIS CRAP.
I absolutely *detest* it when "debugging features" end up being the thing 
that causes crashes. I think it shows a total lack of taste and 
understanding, and I'm totally tired of it. This has happened too many 
times.
Andi: please don't send this patch *ever* again. If a patch that is 
supposed to help debugging just causes problems, that patch should be 
thrown away FOREVER.
Andrew - on that same note: please throw away the dwarf traceback crap 
from your tree that Andi is still apparently pushing. Exact same issue. 
Debugging "helper" code that has historically only caused problems. We 
could equally well just enable frame pointers for debugging and add the 
trivial code to follow that instead, and it would work (the way it has 
worked on x86 basically forever).
Rafael, does reverting just this part (and leaving the "text_poke()" 
cleanups) work for you?
