Do you have to use manual readahead though? What is the performance
like if you just let the kernel do its own thing? The kernel's
readahead provides things like automatic scaling and thrashing
control, so if possible you should just stick to that.
Although you may want to experiment with the maximum readahead on your
working disks:
/sys/block/???/queue/read_ahead_kb
Also, can we get a testcase (ie. minimal compilable code) to reproduce
this problem?
Thanks,
Nick
