Indeed.  RAID usually avoid checksumming unused area, it sums on write
and you don't write "unused" stuff.  
Not syncing unused area is possible, if there was a way for raid resync
to ask the fs what blocks are not in use.  I.e. get the
free block list in disk block order.  Then raid resync could skip those.
