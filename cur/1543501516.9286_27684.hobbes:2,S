Hey all,
	I recently recompiled my kernel to take further advantage of the
PCI bus in Red Hat 5.2 running kernel version number 2.0.36  Now when I
reboot, the ethernet cards in the server that its running on are not
recognized.  I get the following message:
---
SIOCADDRT : Invalid Argument
---
	 It also tells me that there is a problem loading the modules,
with the following message:
---
Finding Module dependencies...  conf:2: missing module arguments
/lib/modules/preferred/modules.dep doesn't exist
---
	The things is that file DOES exist...  I would really appreciate
any help you can offer... Thanks
Please respond to me directly if you are on the Kernel list, since I am
not subscribed there... Thanks
