Hi, 
	Here I am resending revised and hopefully last version of patches I have prepared for DMFE driver.
As it was suggested to me I did revert commit 7628b0a8c01a02966d2228bdf741ddedb128e8f8 that adds basic link support.
So those patches will apply cleanly to 2.6.19 or 2.6.20 with this commit reverted.
Looking for comments, Maxim Levitsky
