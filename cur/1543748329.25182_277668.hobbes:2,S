Almost there, perhaps not...
It doesn't solve the problem completely, if not at all. What was kind of a
deterministic failure now seems probabilistic: the fault still occur on
unplugging the usb-storage stick, but not everytime as before.
Did try several times, reboot included, and now it fails after unplugging
a second or a third time. Never needed to replug/unplug more than 3 times
for it to show up, however.
Here is one sample, taken on the patched RT-V0.7.32-9:
 usb 4-5: USB disconnect, address 7
