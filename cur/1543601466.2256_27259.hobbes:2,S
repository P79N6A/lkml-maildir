... and deals with interrupt state, and any special device
requirements?  Actually, we don't want to deal with any
outstanding I/O.  You don't want to flush any outstanding
requests if you're crashing (which is what LKCD is for).
Sure, submit_bh() when things are running fine.  But not when
you're crashing.  And also, this is intended at some point in
the future to work to raw devices as well.
I don't want to deal with b_end_io(), blk_get_queue(),
generic_make_request() or any of that stuff.  This is
supposed to be raw data to the disk.
Again, the point here is to create a device operation that
allows the driver to enter a dumping state and write out
data raw to the device.  It's not intended for the normal
block operations path.
Thanks,
