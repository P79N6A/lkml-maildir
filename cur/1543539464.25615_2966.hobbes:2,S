	Would you patch the kernel to require 'unlink' as root ask the
user first?  I doubt it.  As it is I'm not 'fighting' you at all.  I don't
know enough about the kernel internals and what you're playing w/ to say
if it's technically correct or not.  I've not voiced any opinion on the
patch and if it should be included or not.
	I do disagree w/ trying to force the issue, however.  There is
peer-review here, and trying to force people to do what you want is not
the way to get everyone to agree.  
	I seem to recall Linus requested that more testing be done because 
it did alot with the internals.  I respect Linus and feel that if he 
thinks that is neccessary, then that is what should be done.  
	Trying to force the issue is going to make people upset at you and 
make them *less* likely to test your patch or agree with you that it should 
go in.

	I don't care about the standards. :)
