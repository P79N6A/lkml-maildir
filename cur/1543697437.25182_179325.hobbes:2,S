If you haven't solved this yet (firmware current?) you might try using a
large fifo, starting a burn, then looking at the system with vmstat to
see if there's a lot of system time. If so, I suspect the you are using
PIO in spite of the new method and selection of DMA for the device.
In any case it will provide a data point.
