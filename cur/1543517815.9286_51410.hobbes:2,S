Two reasons:  (1) identifying cross-volume ("cross-device" equivalent) links 
is harder, or at least more expensive, and (2) directory ACLs complicate 
things a bit more than Unix directory permissions do.  ((2) isn't considered 
much of a problem any more, given that it's now available (and hence a 
potential problem) in various Unixes (i.e. Solaris [gs]etfacl) and it 
doesn't cause problems in practice.)
Add that a VFS check for "ownership" is fairly useless on Coda and AFS, 
because the "owner" is a chimera provided to make Unix happy and may not 
have any relationship to the file's real owner --- and indeed, the 
AFS/DFS/Coda user ID may have no relationship to the Unix/Linux user ID when 
the file is created or manipulated, so with your proposed change it's 
trivial for me to get into a situation where I am forbidden to access my own 
files.  (VFS checks for "group" are even more worthless.)  So you are not 
only breaking Unix semantics, you're introducing the potential to 
incorrectly deny me access to my files.

    We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
