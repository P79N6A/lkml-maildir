Sounds like either your PIT is running slowly or something is
consistently keeping the timer interrupt from being handled. In 2.4 do
you have any time related issues at all?  Does the "Loosing too many
ticks!" message correlate to any event on the system (boot, heavy load)?
Also listing system type, motherboard, any sort of funky devices you've
got might be helpful.
thanks
