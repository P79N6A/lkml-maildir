A UP HT box you mean? That shouldn't be capable of running multiple make -j10s 
without some noticable effect. Apart from looking impressive, there is no 
point in having 30 cpu heavy things running with only 1 and a bit processor 
and the machine being smooth as silk; the cpu heavy things will just be 
unfairly starved in the interest of appearance (I can do that easily enough). 
Please give details if there is a specific issue you think I've broken or 
else I wont know about it.

They're not; the improvements should affect fairness on SMP as well and 
although interactivity is what I'm addressing on the surface, fairness is the 
real issue.
