FYI, on my box (Asus L5D, Athlon 64 + nForce3, 64-bit kernel) there are two
regressions wrt -rc2 related to ACPI.  First, the battery monitor does not work
(
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4665
)
and second, the box hangs solid during resume from disk if IO-APIC is not used
(
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4416
).
The problems have been known for quite some time and remain unresolved,
but apparently they have made it to mainline nevertheless.  I understand
nobody else has reported them, but I also know of some people who run
Linux on the same hardware and 2.6.13 will not work for them if these
issues are present in it.
Greets,
Rafael
