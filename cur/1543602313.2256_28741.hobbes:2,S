If you want everything to be fast, buy more RAM and use no swap whatsoever.
Swap is useful if your total memory requirements are big but working
set is significantly smaller. You need RAM to cover working set
and RAM+swap to cover total memory requirements.
As you can see, amount of RAM and swap thus *application dependent*.
