Sometimes you need extremely low overhead time measurements, which need 
not be too accurate. One way to do this is to dump rdtsc measurements 
into some array, and later scale it using the cpu frequency.
I've done exactly this. The processes were pinned to their processors, 
and there was no frequency scaling in effect. It worked very well.
