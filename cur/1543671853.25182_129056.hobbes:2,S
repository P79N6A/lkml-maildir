I agree with Måns completely.
CreateProcess() is *horrible*.  It takes 10 arguments, several of them
being pointers to structures.  Ugh!
Besides, the CreateProcessAsUser() call (which takes 13 arguments IIRC)
demonstrates why such all-in-one-and-a-kitchen-sink calls are
fundamentally flawed.
In the few cases where they do not demand unnecessary arguments, they
simply lack the functionality that is actually needed.
I would argue that any time spent on replicating such monsters in Linux
would be far better spent optimizing the basic calls
(exec/fork/dup/close/fcntl/...) instead.
That was my 0.02 Euro on that one.
