Sounds right.
Someone else doing the bisect suggested that
0475ac0845f9295bc5f69af45f58dff2c104c8d1 is the problem commit.
Unfortunately I can't see anything wrong there.
Sid when you get that far if you can confirm or deny that
0475ac0845f9295bc5f69af45f58dff2c104c8d1 is the problem commit
I would appreciate the extra data point.  Having two people
report the problem at the exact same place would confirm for
me that we actually have a good trace, and that I really am
blind.
