I'd really go for k(mem_)zalloc, but a kmem_cache_alloc leads people toward
writing bad code.  The purpose of the slab allocator is to allow caching
readily constructed objects, a _zalloc destroys them on alloc.
I think code using kmem_cache_alloc really wants to use kzalloc and instead
of maintaining it's pool.
