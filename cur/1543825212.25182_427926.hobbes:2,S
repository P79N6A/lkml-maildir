It's not doing the same as the old code so is your suggested fix a correct 
replacement?
For example, given 0xfff for size the current code rounds res->end to the 
next 0x1000 boundary and adds 0xfff. Your propose fix just rounds it to 
the next 0x1000 if I'm reading it correctly but is what the code was meant 
to do in the first place? Using masks, the equivilant of the current code 
is something like;
#define push_end(res, mask) do { \
 	res->end = -(-res->end & ~(unsigned long)mask); \
 	res->end += mask; \
} while (0)
