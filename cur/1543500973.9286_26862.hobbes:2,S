yes this makes sense. it's like a bypass...

and this, like a shortcut....
but, the following seems to me, like a detour...
   if (bh_mask & bh_active)
      goto handle_bh;
handle_bh_back:
      .........
handle_bh:
   do_bottom_half();
   goto handle_bh_back;   
this is what appears is schedule(). i compiled this to asm,
and saw that this adds two 'jmp's and two '.p2align's
`gcc -O2 -S original_sched.c`
------
	movl bh_mask,%eax
	andl bh_active,%eax
	jne .L449
	.p2align 4,,7
.L450:
#APP
	cli
#NO_APP
        .............
.L449:
	call do_bottom_half
	jmp .L450
	.p2align 4,,7
.L439:
        ..............
============================
`gcc -O2 -S test_sched.c`
------
	movl bh_mask,%eax
	andl bh_active,%eax
	je .L448
	call do_bottom_half
	.p2align 4,,7
.L448:
#APP
	cli
#NO_APP
=============================
i have a suspicion where the original_sched.s
might be better... that we expect to _not_
'jne .L449' most of the time?
if you could take a moment and clarify this,
i'd appreciate it. i know this might be the
wrong place for this question, but i don't
know anyone who'd know better than the
subscribers to this list.
thanks!
