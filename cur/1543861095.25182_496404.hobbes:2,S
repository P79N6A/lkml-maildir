I don't think this is anything to do with the sata_sil24 driver. 
Something really wierd seems to be going on with interrupts on this machine:

Hmm, you might want to try not forcing the local APIC enabled by 
removing the lapic option from the kernel command line. Don't know if it 
could be related though.

These "IRQ proble failed" errors don't seem right at all.

So eth0's not happy.

The SATA card is getting timeouts. And from your other mail:

DataRequest }

Your onboard IDE controller is also timing out.. Sounds to me like some 
kind of general IRQ problem, though you'd have to be losing interrupts 
on IRQ 10, 12 and 14 which seems pretty extreme. Maybe a hardware 
problem, are you sure you have enough power to run this many drives in 
the box?
