Greetings,
I recently compiled kernel 2.2.1 and almost everything is fine.
The only obvious problem is that my old Laserjet 4L stopped working.
While the modules are loaded, I get a message to the effect that the
printer was found. But if I send something to lpr, it gets stuck
until I reboot the computer with kernel 2.0.36.
Unfortunately, I forgot where to find the log file that contains
the boot messages (where was that one again?)
Does anyone have any idea what could have gone wrong?
TIA,
Juergen
