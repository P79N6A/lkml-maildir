Thanks.

Well as I just said the Daniel, I was under the impression I needed a
hook that was only called from settimeofday().  The comments I've
recieved from everyone has given me good cause to re-evaluate.
I think I can make it work without the hook, that started this
discussion.  Thomas, I think it's probably best to axe it now.  If I
/really/ need it then I'll start the discussion again :)  Thanks.

Yes you're rigth I don't need to move the timer_check_rtc() call.
