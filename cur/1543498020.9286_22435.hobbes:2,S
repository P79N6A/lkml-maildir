Hi,
Just an idea - would it be possible, instead of having to manually insmod
khttp (and keep it loaded all the time which defeats the purpose of it
being a module rather than in the kernel), to modify the networking code
which accepts the connection request and does a
request_module("serve-tcp-port-80") (with alias serve-port-80 khttpd) to
load your khttpd automagicaly?
This could be useful in the future when more inkernel network servers are
written.
Regards,
