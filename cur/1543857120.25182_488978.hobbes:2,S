The same way we do atomic_t.
What I hadn't realised (because I hadn't read dhowell's implementation
... because it hasn't shown up on git2.kernel.org yet) is that he
doesn't actually *use* this unlocked-assignment that would cause the
problem.  He uses bitops which use the same locks.

The difference is that we can (and do) acquire a lock for atomic_set.
We can't acquire one for X = 6.

Yep, we agree.

We do hash based on the address -- and we try to arrange things such
that different spinlocks are acquired for different cachelines.  I don't
know if anyone's benchmarked it recently to see how well it performs.
It's a bit of a waltzing bear [1] at times ;-)
[1] The wonder is not how well it waltzes, but that it waltzes at all
