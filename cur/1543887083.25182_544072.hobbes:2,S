You can upgrade a bunch of system utilities, but I'm not sure it's worth 
doing. The system I'm on is RH8.0 patched to run later kernels when my 
development machine went down. I got 2.5.52 to boot, last stable was 
2.5.47-ac6 and I gave up.
Unless you have some major need to upgrade the kernel without the 
distribution, grab the latest RH kernel, or use the latest 2.4 kernel 
available.
