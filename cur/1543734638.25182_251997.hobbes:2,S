That's a bit of a problem, isn't it?  As we can accumulate an arbitrarily
large number of hits within the hash table is it not possible that the
/proc/profile results could be grossly inaccurate?
If you had two front-ends per cpu to the profiling buffer then the CPU
which is running the /proc/profile read could tell all the other CPUs to
flip to their alternate buffer and can then perform accumulation at its
leisure.
How does oprofile get around this?  I guess in most modes the CPUs are not
synchronised.
One wonders how long we should keep flogging the /prof/profile profiling
code.  What systems are seeing this livelock?
