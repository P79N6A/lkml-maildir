The problem is that there is nothing as a single "right". There exists no
consistent definition of how should the ordering look like and the fact
that 2.4 and 2.6 differ are just a consequence of that.
From the point of view of 2.4 users, the "right" definition is the one used
by 2.4 kernels.
From the point of view of 2.6 users, the only right definition is the current one.
For people installing Linux from scratch, it doesn't matter because neither
definition has any advantage, both give unstable results when new devices
are plugged in.
Moreover, the depth-first order is probably a little bit more stable,
because on-board buses usually have lower numbers than buses where hotpluggable
devices live (e.g., cardbus), so newly plugged devices are nicely ordered
after all built-in ones.
If you want to have stable names, use udev, relying on any order is wrong
as new devices can always appear anywhere.
				Have a nice fortnight
