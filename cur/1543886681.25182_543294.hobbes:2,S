and this.  After grabbing cwq lock, compare it to get_wq_data() first,
if they are the same, both are using the same lock so there's no
reason for the barriers.  If they are different, it doesn't matter
anyway.  We need to retry the locking.
  retry:
	cwq = get_sw_data(work);
	if (!cwq)
		return ret;
	spin_lock_irq(&cwq->lock);
	if (unlikely(cwq != get_wq_data(work))) {
		/* oops wrong cwq */
		spin_unlock_irq(&cwq->lock);
		goto retry;	/* or just return 0; */
	}
	if (!list_empty(&work->entry)) {
		list_del_init(&work->entry);
		ret = 1;
	}
	spin_unlock_irq(&cwq->lock);
Although grabbing cwq->lock doesn't mean anything to other cwqs, it
does guarantee work->wq_data can't be changed to or from it, so the
cwq equality test is guaranteed to work.

We first prevent requeueing from happening; then, wait for each cwq to
finish the work, so I think we're guaranteed that they're finished on
all cpus.  Otherwise, the 'sync' part isn't too useful as it means all
rearming tasks might be running on completion of cancel_work_sync().
Thanks a lot for fixing this.
