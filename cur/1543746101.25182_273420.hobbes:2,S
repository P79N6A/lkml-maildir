this is quite different.
As you need to enforce security policies when accessing the block
device, you have to move the filesystem into its own daemon.
You cannot do it in a library.
It is irrelevant for the application weather the fs resides in a
separate daemon or in the kernel itself.
But support of different views on files is something different.
You can do that in a library, you only need an interface that is
capable of storing your data. The kernel already provides that
interface.
