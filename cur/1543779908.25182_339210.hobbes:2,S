Hello!
This fix breaks x64_64:

    * include/linux/mm.h, mm/memory.c:
    [PATCH] fix get_user_pages bug
...
The system doesn't boot.  Most processes are killed by VM.
The patch does more than it claims.  It actually redefines VM_FAULT_OOM
and VM_FAULT_SIGBUS.  Unfortunately, a quick look at
arch/x86_64/mm/fault.c shows that the return value of handle_mm_fault()
is compared with numerical constants.  This patch helps partly:
--- arch/x86_64/mm/fault.c
+++ arch/x86_64/mm/fault.c
@@ -439,15 +439,15 @@ good_area:
 	 * the fault.
 	 */
 	switch (handle_mm_fault(mm, vma, address, write)) {
-	case 1:
+	case VM_FAULT_MINOR:
 		tsk->min_flt++;
 		break;
-	case 2:
+	case VM_FAULT_MAJOR:
 		tsk->maj_flt++;
 		break;
-	case 0:
+	case VM_FAULT_SIGBUS:
 		goto do_sigbus;
-	default:
+	case VM_FAULT_OOM:
 		goto out_of_memory;
 	}
 
Now the system boot goes a little further and then the kernel reports a
BUG in mm/memory.c:985.  Apparently __handle_mm_fault() returns
something unexpected.  My guess is that some x86_64 specific functions
return -1 and 0 when they mean VM_FAULT_SIGBUS and VM_FAULT_OOM.
Returning -1 would trigger BUG(), returning 0 would be treated as
VM_FAULT_OOM rather than VM_FAULT_SIGBUS.
I'm not sure I'll be able to fix it quickly, but I hope the gurus will
beat me at that.  In the meantime, please don't make any releases unless
the "commit f33ea7f404e592e4563b12101b7a4d17da6558d7" is reverted.
