Section 9 of the GPL says:
<--  snip  -->
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
Free Software Foundation.
<--  snip  -->
This implicitely says that if the version of the GPL is specified it's 
fixed.
AFAIR in 2.2 times Linus added the explicit version statement present in
COPYING.
