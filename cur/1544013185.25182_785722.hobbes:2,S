Hi,
  I am using linux-2.6.27.  I am testing power management after
booting out of a SD/MMC card.
  My root file system is on a SD card.
  I am issuing the following command to suspend
      $ echo -n mem > /sys/power/state
 What happens is, The kernel hangs and it does not come out of suspend.
 even after i press keypad/generate serial input data.
 # echo -n mem > /sys/power/state
PM: Syncing filesystems ... done.
Freezing user space processes ... (elapsed 0.00 seconds) done.
Freezing remaining freezable tasks ... (elapsed 0.00 seconds) done.
mmc0: card e624 removed
--- kernel hangs---
The same works, If i boot on NFS and mount a SD card.
PM works, suspend and resume work fine. This means
that the PM of SD MMC driver works properly.
However, I have a problem when the rootfs is on SDMMC card.
Has anyone tried this before?
Am i missing something here?
Regards,
sriram
