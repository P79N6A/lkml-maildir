Parden me for asking a dumb question, but what's being accomplished by
resetting the chip if the system has crashed?  Why not reset the chip
when the system reboots and it sees the PCI bus reset?  I guess I'm
missing the purpose of the ASF heartbeat; why does the networking chip
need a chip-specific watchdog?
