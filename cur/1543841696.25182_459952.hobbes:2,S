This seems to happen inside hrtimer_get_softirq_time().
wall_to_monotonic is negative.
Why does the check trigger ? We compare a "long", which contains a
negative value against some positive constant. 
ktime_t ktime_set(const long secs, const unsigned long nsecs)
{
	if (unlikely(secs >= KTIME_SEC_MAX)) {
where KTIME_SEC_MAX is 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF / 1000 000 000 = 
9223372036 == 0x225C17D04,
which is compared against 
-1157140842 == 0xFFFFFFFFBB076E96
This smells like gcc magic. Can you please disassemble the code in
question ?

Hmm, not sure.
