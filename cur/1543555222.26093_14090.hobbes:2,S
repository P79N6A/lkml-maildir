Then, I don't understand why the EINVAL error condition does not also include
dot-dot as last component.

I think that there is another case where EINVAL (or EBUSY) should be more
relevant than ENOTEMPTY: consider a process invoking 'rmdir("..")' where "."
is empty and its current root directory (just because ".." and "." refer
to the same directory which is actually empty).
