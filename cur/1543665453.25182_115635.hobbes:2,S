Sorry.  I expressed that wrong.  It is not multi-NIC that ipconfig.c gets
wrong.  It is multiple DHCP servers.   You just get multiple dhcp
servers when you have multiple NICs.
The policies in ipconfig.c are quite good, they just are not
universally applicable.  But as ipconfig.c is in the kernel it tends
to get used where it is inappropriate.

I had forgotten about that one, and I believe it helps in some cases.

I can change the contents of my ramdisk as easily as I can change
the kernel command line.  For the complex setups just placing
a configuration file in the ramdisk is what seems to work the best
in practice.
