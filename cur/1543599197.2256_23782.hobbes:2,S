For me it looks good too. I just tested it on HP parisc in text- and fb-mode and 
it worked without any problems. I only had to add a missing semicolon to the
patch:
linux-2.4.8-ac9/drivers/char/console.c:
                        while (cnt--) {
-                               u16 a = *q;
+                               a = scr_readw(q);
                                a = ((a) & 0x88ff) | (((a) & 0x7000) >> 4) | (((a) & 0x0700) << 4);
-                               *q++ = a;
+                               scr_writew(a, q);
+                               q++
                                     ^^^ here
