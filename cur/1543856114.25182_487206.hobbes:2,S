Do you go back and change all the signed-off lines too when people change jobs?

Then remove all the lines like the following:
- *	1.0	16 Feb 2000, Tigran Aivazian <tigran@sco.com>
+ *	1.0	16 Feb 2000, Tigran Aivazian
  *		Initial release.
- *	1.01	18 Feb 2000, Tigran Aivazian <tigran@sco.com>
+ *	1.01	18 Feb 2000, Tigran Aivazian 
  *		Added read() support + cleanups.
If you keep them, they tell the history and email addresses are part of the history.
Or simply remove all the history and tell people to look for the information in git changelogs.
The way you are doing it, serves no purpose other than losing information.
