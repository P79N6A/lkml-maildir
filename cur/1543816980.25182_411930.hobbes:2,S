I repeat just once more: the supported method for identifying hwmon/sensors
chips is a Perl script called sensors-detect that is distributed with the
lm-sensors package.

No, because that is not supported.  All of the major distributions package
lm-sensors, and AFAIK they all build hwmon/sensors as modules.  They don't
insert any of them by default.  If a distro was silly enough to blindly
insert them all... then it would take forever to boot and nobody would use
it.

Feel free to write a patch for drivers/busses/i2c/i2c-pca-isa.c;  I don't
have that hardware myself.  Otherwise, my final advice is:
	Patient: It hurts when I do this.
	Doctor: Don't do that.
