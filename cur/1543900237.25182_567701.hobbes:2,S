Greetings *!
I'm looking for a way to disable (PM low power mode) some devices I
rarely/never use on my laptop to save some more power. With 2.6.17,
IIRC, I was able to echo -n 2 > /sys/bus/pci/../power to put things
into low power mode. (I don't know if it ever worked, but at least it
looked like it did.)
..-2.6.22(-ck1) w/ CONFIG_PM_SYSFS_DEPRECATED doesn't let me change this
state. evident :) -----------------^^^^^^^^^^
Is there a proper way to do this (setpci, if I'd know the registers)?
Is it gone/going inside drivers (like USB_SUSPEND) and I don't have to
worry?
I currently don't load the modules in question - but I'm not sure if it
helps, as they might already be powered on by PCI initialization/BIOS
(/sys/bus/pci/../state cats "0").
THX, ritch
