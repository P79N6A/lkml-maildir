   At this point I am only aware of one place in the kernel where timers and 
   other BH code interact, that being deliver_to_old_ones() in net/core/dev.c.
Are you absolutely sure?  What about serial drivers and the TTY layer?
Have you audited all of that code too?  What about SCSI_BH?  What
about IMMEDIATE_BH, TQUEUE_BH?  Do they interact non-trivially with
timers too?
Alexey is right, there needs to be a real audit here before this
patch may be considered.
