Agreed, although I would go one step further. I see no reason why it
matters whether these are *I2C* RTC or not. I have no concrete proposal
but it really sounds like a common RTC interface would be needed here -
if it doesn't exist already. Can't say more unfortunately, as I never
had to use a RTC myself.

Good work, thanks.
