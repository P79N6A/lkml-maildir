Greg,
I'm gonna speak for Bluetooth USB devices.
I do have bunch of things like Kodak digi camera, Sony DV camcorder, CF 
reader, etc. But they don't
seem to care much about which HCD is used and work equally well with both 
usb-uhci and uhci drivers.
I used to be a uhci driver fan :). But starting somewhere from 2.4.16 or so 
Bluetooth devices work much better
with usb-uhci driver (not all devices but most of them). Even thought 
Bluetooth is pretty slow (about 700kbps)
performance difference is sometimes pretty significant 20-30% (ie usb-uhci 
driver is faster).
So basically I vote for usb-uhci. However some things will have to be 
fixed. We (Bluetooth folks) have couple
of devices that refuse to work with usb-uhci (I didn't test the latest 
usb-uhci though).
Thanks
Max
