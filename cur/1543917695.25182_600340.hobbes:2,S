Thanks.
Of course there are other means too to determine if TCP flows do negotiate 
SACK enabled or not. Depending on your test case (which is fully unknown 
to me) they may or may not be usable... At least the value of tcp_sack 
sysctl on both systems or tcpdump catching SYN packets should give that 
detail. ...If you know to which hosts TCP could be connected (and active) 
to, while the WARNING triggers, it's really easy to test what is being 
negotiated as it's unlikely to change at short notice and any TCP flow to 
that host will get us the same information though the WARNING would not be 
triggered with it at this time. Obviously if at least one of the remotes 
is not known or the set ends up being mixture of reno and SACK flows, then 
we'll just have to wait and see which fish we get...
