Unfortunately no, it is a production system now to which I don't have physical 
access.

It is a new system, which came with preinstalled RH7.2 and kernel 2.4.23 which 
has highmem support and is stable. I immediately installed 2.4.25 also w/ 
highmem & highmem i/o. After I got one I/O lockup under light load, I 
immediately recompiled wo/ highmem support. After that no problems 
whatsoever.
