I understand your point. Can we agree on just doing this for functions which
are handed off-tree and on-tree nodes and have to care for locking reasons?
It is ok for functions to enforce their API with BUG_ON(). But this part should
not be generalized, since this part really depends on the user.
Each rbtree user having its own private hackery for this is wasted developer
resources IMHO. 
So please either provide common helpers or just delete the potential users
if you think this is not needed.
I'm happy either way.
