But they all end up at the exact same place with the same set of parameters. 
The only difference I can see is that some return 1 while the other is void.  It 
seems to me that you could send them all to one of the ones that returns 1. 
Once that is done, then you could just send them all to where ever 
linux_debug_hook points and have it do the signal resolution and return the 1. 
That way that code could look at its return address and see something useful.
