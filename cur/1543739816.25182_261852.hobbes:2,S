You mean not going negative? The problem here as I understand here is 
we dont release the count if the PageReserved is set, but we should. 
You mean there are other codepaths which release pages? That use __free_pages
which ignores PageReserved pages.
Is the problem wider than what I think?

All these are have codepaths which release pages using put_page()'s?
