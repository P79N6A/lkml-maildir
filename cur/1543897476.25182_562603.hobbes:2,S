That much I worked out for myself.  It's kinda staggering that a fairly
major feature in two fairly major filesystems got removed without even a
mention in the changelog.  I don't recall having seen it discussed in email
but I obviously missed that bit.
Look, I'm one micron from just dropping the whole lot.  These changes
simply have not received the amount of energy, effort, care, attention and
testing which a change of this magnitude requires.
