I am trying to compile linux kernel v0.01 and v1.0 on both slackware 3.5(gcc2.7.1) and redhat 6.0(current egcs). I didnt success despite I made my great effort. Can someone here share his expericence with me of how to compile old version kernel(any version except the few recent ones)? 
Thanks a lot for any answer or comments. Pls also cc to my email address.
