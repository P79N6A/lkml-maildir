Yes, Tear sent the correct patch a while back, akpm picked it up, and i slurped
it into my tree just last night for 2.6.23:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/lenb/linux-acpi-2.6.git;a=commit;h=4d2fafd17a325b3f4f5f9edb1211bc7f4c311269

Yep, it came to us in this Cset on 2003-08-09

A young, impressionable maintainer, I'd been working on Linux for about 2 months.
I sync'd the workarounds from 2.4 into 2.5, and this particular one came
from the "UnitedLinux" tree.
My theory at the time was that SuSE had been most successful deploying ACPI,
and so upstream should benefit from their workarounds.
I later realized that this was a strategic mistake, as distro workarounds
often paper-over real bugs by addressing the symptom only.
A bunch of these entries were removed over time, and these days I add
DMI workarounds only when we are sure we have the root cause.
cheers,
