Of course they will be signalled. And eventually we should patch up
mutltipath-tools to read the exising events from the uevent socket.
But even with that patch there is a quite largish window during
which IOs will be sent to the blocked device, and hence will be
stuck in the request queue until the timer expires.

Yes. But currently we have a very high failover latency as we always have
to wait for the requeued commands to time-out.
Hence we're damaging performance on arrays with inexpensive failover.

Well, the in-flight commands are owned by the HBA driver, which should
have the proper code to terminate / return those commands with the
appriopriate codes. They will then be rescheduled and will be caught
like 'normal' IO requests.
