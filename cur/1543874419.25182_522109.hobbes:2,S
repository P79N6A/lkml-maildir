Teo, the units will go away. I'll leave only 4 of them:
1. I/O, just to hide some I/O related complexities.
2. Scanning: just because I am planning to add other device attaching
methods, without scanning.
3. Wear-leveling, just because I want to improve the algorithm in
future. Changing algorithm means changing data structures. So I want to
keeps them separate.
4. EBA - because I want to keep all mapping-related stuff in one place.
Well, this does not have to be called unit, just mapping-related code in
on file. Also, long-term is to have the table on-flash (currently it is
in-ram which does not scale well).
Everything else will be folded together. No itsy-bitsy. I've almost
finished this re-structuring, doing bug-fixing.
P.S.: I'll let other folks to comment the other stuff.
