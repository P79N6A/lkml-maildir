Hm...  That patch was for a reason...  It seems to me that doing anything short 
of putting "xtime" (or better, clock_gettime() :)) in at fork time is not going 
to fix anything.   As written the start_time in the task_struct is fixed.  If 
"now - uptime + time_from_boot_to_process_start" it is wandering, it must be the 
fault of "now - uptime".  Since this seems to be wandering, and we corrected 
uptime in the referenced patch, is it safe to assume that "now" is actually 
being computed from "jiffies" rather than a gettimeofday()?
Seems like that is where we should be changing things.
