No. Do not use sleep_on() in new drivers. sleep_on() can miss interrupts
unless you own the global interrupt lock(*). Your driver could fail on SMP.
Please use either wait_event() [only possible if you don't use spinlocks],
or manually implement sleep_on(): [wait_event() + spin_unlock_irq() just
before schedule() + spin_lock_irq() just behind schedule()].
It's implemented in <linux/sched.h> for both 2.2 and 2.3
(*) or lock_kernel(), but this is only possible from outside interrupt
contexts.
