Well, in theory, it could be possible to construct a kind of a system to
provide "partial" downloads for "partial" compiles. I imagine that one would
download a "config pack" from the net, do make config wich would contain,
basically, dependencies of all the files from the kernel sources needed to
generate a custom kernel for the submitting user. Such file would be sent to a
server (of course one such server wouldn't suffice) and the user would
retrieve only a required subset of the kernel source tree, compile the kernel
and be happy. It would be further improved by using rdist or similar
mechanism, assuming that the user won't change his machine's configuration too
often, the next source downloads would be as easy as retrieving patches to the
changed files.
  It looks nice in theory, but would probably require creating a protocol to
serve the config submissions and retrieval of the required files. 
  Hmm... it was just a thought of a moment :-))) Ignore it if it sounds stupid
:))
