     I mis-read the intent of the original post.  I thought the intent, the way
I read it, was that ONLY the newer chipsets coming out would be supported in
the development kernel.
     But if the development kernel isn't the the appropriate place to introduce
drivers for new hardware, then what is?  Certainly not in a stable kernel that
is supposed to be, after all, stable.
