If that would be true, we would be still in the stone age. 
Or not, actually I think the first cell in the universe would not bother 
itself dividing into the two just because it could spent infinite time 
trying to make itself better.

When some idea is implemented it is virtually impossible to change it,
only recreate new one with fixed issues. So, we have multiple ext,
reiser and many others. I do not say btrfs is broken or has design
problems, it is really interesting filesystem, but all we have our own 
opinions about how things should be done, that's it.
Btw, we do have so many network protocols for different purposes, that
number of (storage) filesystems is negligebly small compared to it. 
Internet as is popular today is just a subset of where network is used.
And we do invent new protocols each time we need something new, which
does not fit into existing models (for example TCP by design can not
work with very long-distance links with tooo long RTT). We have sctp to
fix some tcp issues. Number of IP layer 'neighbours' is even more.
Physical media layer has many different protocols too.
And that is just what exists in the linux tree...

Yep, I know. 
Wasting my time is one of the most pleasant things I ever tried in my life.

Call me greedy bastard, but I do not care about world happiness, it is
just impossible to achieve. So I like what I do right now.
If it will be rest under the layer of dust I do not care, I like the
process of creating, so if it will fail, I just will get new knowledge.
