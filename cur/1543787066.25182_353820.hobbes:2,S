They are sure as hell not something that a _driver_ is supposed to use.

And the point is, you can do that _too_.
Do it right. Don't cache pointers to threads. Use the pid.
Your security arguments are _pointless_. As proven by the fact that SIGIO 
happily uses a pid, and gets it right. Try to use _that_ infrastructure 
instead, since that's what it's _meant_ for.
The fact is, having drivers much around with thread locking is not
acceptable. Drivers _will_ get it wrong, and even if they didn't, it's
kernel internal data structures that drivers have no business in touching.
