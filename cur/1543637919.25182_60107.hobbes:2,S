Subject: 2.5.29: bug in ide and hd kernel option handling
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

On my 486 test box (ISA/VLB only, CONFIG_PCI=n), passing any
any ide or hd kernel option (like idebus=33) to 2.5.29 results
in a kernel hang at boot: I get the initial "Uncompressing ..
booting .." and then nothing.
With 2.5.27, the kernel instantly rebooted itself instead.
I don't know when this problem appeared. I only recently starting
experimenting with ide kernel options in an attempt to get an
old qd6580 controller card going -- alas the second channel
never wants to show up :-(
