Yes it is.  
If you are running a webserver. 
Or a highly threaded application.
Or a machine with a lot of users.  (For example, a University unix server)
Or an ftp server.  (Where is the Linux equivalent of FreeBSD's ftp.cdrom.com?)
It is really a question of "Where does Linux want to go?"  
If it wants to be a high performance server, Linux needs a new scheduler. 
If it wants to be the most efficient desktop machine, then it doesn't
need it NOW.  However, the average number of programs people are
running on their machine are increasing, not decreasing.  
Linux's real penetration has been in the server market.  Why not make
it the best server it can be?
