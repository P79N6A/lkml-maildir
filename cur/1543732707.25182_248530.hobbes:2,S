Aaargh. How about a tar that recognizes when the filesystem has metas and 
saves/restores them by default, with a warning when it's losings data because 
it's restoring to a simpler filesystem?
And maybe a switch --forget-metas.
Thousands of sys-admins will thank you to not make it easier to lose data with 
the scripts they have already written.
