Andre,
   One of my two volume groups, unfortunately the one with
/usr, /var, /opt, and /home, isn't recognized by 0.9's vgscan when
I reboot under 2.4.0-test13-pre4.    But since the second volume
group is visible, and you just told meit should be, then I can just
copy volumes over under test13-pre3 and destroy and recreate the
first volume group.
Thanks,
