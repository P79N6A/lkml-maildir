Hi David,
This looks like it's working!
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:03:BA:04:5B:D7
          inet addr:10.0.0.12  Bcast:10.0.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          inet6 addr: fe80::203:baff:fe04:5bd7/10 Scope:Link
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:623264 errors:0 dropped:4 overruns:4 frame:4
          TX packets:501679 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:100
          RX bytes:864388119 (824.3 MiB)  TX bytes:719041874 (685.7 MiB)
          Interrupt:5 Base address:0x8400
There are a few dropped packets, and the card misses a few incoming
immediatly after a dropped packet although I guess this is it picking
itself up off the ground after RX has hung.
Also, regarding the missing MAC address on most architectures, I have it
on good authority that the last six digits of the MAC address are stored
in the Vital Product Data area on the PCI boards (presumably because the
first 6 are the "standard" SUN MAC prefix).
I had a quick fiddle around with pci_find_capability(<blah>,
PCI_CAP_ID_VPD), but it always returns NULL (i.e. no VPD). However, I've
also noticed that no-one appears to use that macro in any of the kernel
source. Is there another way to look at the VPD?
Many Thanks,
Beezly
