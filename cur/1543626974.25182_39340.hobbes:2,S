Is Nick's system based on a Tyan TigerMP mobo with 2 cpu ?
I have the same kind of problem.
My TigerMP based system is very unstable the first 5 minutes
I use it, and then become as stable as I can expect.
I suspect my power suply to be picky about temperature and cannot
deliver the needed power when it is cold. It is an enermax 350W
