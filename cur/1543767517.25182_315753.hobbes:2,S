It seems like it would not be to hard to create a timer test suite that
just hammers the timer subsystem, creating and deleting and modifying
zillions of timers, changing the system time, etc.  Combined with
running with HZ=10000 or something it seems like you could shake out
bugs a lot faster than just running & waiting for a race to show up.
I've seen timer related issues (the set_rtc_mmss issue that George
Anzinger fixed) while testing the RT patchset that I could only ever
reproduce once.
