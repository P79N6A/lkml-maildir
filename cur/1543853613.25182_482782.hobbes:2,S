I said it before, and it's worth repeating.  Dissolving HAL in the
sources is easy.  It's just a matter of moving functions around without
serious chances of breaking anything as long as the source compiles.
The whole "HAL-based architecture" can be reshuffled and eliminated by
one person in a few days.
Making things work properly takes years.  That's what MadWifi has been
working on for a long time, using contributions and bug reports from
scores of users and developers.
Rejecting MadWifi because it's HAL based is like throwing away a diamond
ring because it's too narrow.
