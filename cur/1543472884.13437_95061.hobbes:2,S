One solution to get it work quite correctly with nothing else:
route add -host 134.147.2.1 gw your_router
ifconfig tunl0 192.168.1.44 netmask 255.255.255.255 pointopoint 
134.147.2.1
route add -net 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 134.147.2.1 
tunl0
as 134.147.2.1 has been declared pointopoint, it can be a gateway
as you have a host route via eth0 before route via tunl0 it works.
So this solution works, but is not the good one.
Second solution is:
- Get iproute2 package from ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing
- Do on each side:
       ip tunnel add tunl1 mode ipip local your_eth0_ip remote 
rmt_eth0_ip
       ifconfig tunl1 this_side_tunnel_ip
dont know why, it doesnt work with tunl0
Both solutions works, the last one is hower the good one,
