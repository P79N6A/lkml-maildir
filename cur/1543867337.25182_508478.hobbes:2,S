Well, we should be able to determine that experimentally (at least on 
specific controllers) with a little test program that just writes little 
bits of data and fsyncs repeatedly (assuming that does in fact trigger 
FUAs currently..) If it runs faster than the drive could possibly be 
rewriting the physical disk then obviously the FUA bit is not getting 
through and/or not respected and we can blacklist FUA on that controller.
Also, the FUA bit in the NCQ commands is in the device register, so it's 
not like the PMP fields where it's not used for anything else and so the 
controller messing with it wouldn't be otherwise noticed..

Unfortunately not all drives that support NCQ support the non-NCQ FUA 
commands (my Seagates are like this).
There's definitely a potential advantage to FUA with NCQ - if you have 
non-synchronous accesses going on concurrently with synchronous ones, if 
you have to use non-NCQ FUA or flush cache commands, you have to wait 
for all the IOs of both types to drain out before you can issue the 
flush (since those can't be overlapped with the NCQ read/writes). And if 
you can only use flush cache, then you're forcing all the writes to be 
flushed including the non-synchronous ones you didn't care about. 
Whether or not the block layer currently exploits this I don't know, but 
it definitely could.

Well, there are also probably drives that ignore flush cache commands or 
  fail to do other things that they should. There's only so far we can 
go in coping if the firmware authors are being retarded. If any drive is 
broken like that we should likely just blacklist NCQ on it entirely as 
obviously little thought or testing went into the implementation..
