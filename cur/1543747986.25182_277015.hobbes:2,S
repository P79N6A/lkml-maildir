Hi,
Assuming that I define "free memory" as maximum memory that can be
allocated without causing swapping, is there a way I can give the best
"free memory" amount estimate?
I've tried to play with /proc/meminfo values with some progress, but I'd
like to get a qualified answer from people working with VM bits and
bytes.
Thanks a lot
Giga
