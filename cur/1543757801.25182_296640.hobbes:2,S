It is hard (if not impossible) to find out /what/ is broken (and how) and
fix it automatically. As you were told, D means the process is waiting for
some event. That event /might/ happen sometime (waiting for slow hardware)
or never (kernel programming error, hardware forgot the operation in
progress, ...).  So you might fake it out by making believe the event did
happen. What if was just delayed, and /does/ then happen with nobody
waiting?
Any such is just papering over the problems, and is /massive/ complexity
for no real gain.

Sure. But there is /no way/ to know if the task will ever do something
(Turing's undecibility sees to that, even with perfect hardware), so the
only chance is to wait and see if the task releases it by itself. If you
just want to axe the task, you'd have to know beforehand what it will do
(and do it for the task on killing it). But the /task/ couldn't do it, what
guarantees the cleanup can?

On process end, i.e., when we know the stuff won't be used anymore. If the
program is stuck, kill it and go as before. If it doesn't go away cleanly,
something is /seriously/ wrong... and it is anybody's guess what.

It is hard enough to program without such restrictions. This would
incidentally also mean that the kernel has to be hard real time,
always. The usual PC hardware just isn't up to that, for starters.
And what would you do if you have nested locks, and the outer one times
out? Must kill the inner one beforehand... more complexity still.

If the system takes all extant resources for managing said resources, it is
somewhat pointless...
