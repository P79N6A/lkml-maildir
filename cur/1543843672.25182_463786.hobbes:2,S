Let me explain my network environment, My program is running on a two
adapters machine, whose IP is 192.168.0.1/8 and 192.168.0.2/8, then,
my destination is two machine, whose IP is 192.168.0.3/8 and
192.168.0.4/8. I use four 100M exchange and a 1000M exchange cennected
them to ensure the choke point is not at network  equipment.
when I use two socket without bonding, one socket is bind
192.168.0.1/8 and sendto 192.168.0.3/8, the other is bind
192.168.0.2/8 and sendto 192.168.0.4/8, but, as you see, I get a
result that the speed of send by two adapters is equal to the only one
adapter's.
yesterday. I got an uncertain idea, is the problem that IP layer is
separate with Eth layer ? when I bind src IP, it just do helpful to IP
layer, not real bind the adapter? when I send, the real ethreal
adapter is select by IP route? If the two interface can go
destinnation both, IP layer will choose the frist, not use both? Am I
right?
If so, when I use bonding, the adapter's physical address is the frist
one, Do this means that all of the packet come to my machine will go
through in the frist one adapter?
Thx all.
Best Regard.
