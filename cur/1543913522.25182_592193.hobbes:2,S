CONFIG_MODULE=n will save ~10%
CONFIG_MODULE=y - ~1%
Exact figure depends on .config (whether you happen to include
especially "fat" code or not).
I want to explain a bit where I am coming from. I am working on busybox,
and last release made busybox smaller by "whopping" 2%. This is the result
of a hundred or so of small code and data shrinks.
It basically means that I am close to the point of diminishing returns
trying to make busybox smaller, and memory wastage on the running
embedded system is now elsewhere - including kernel.
