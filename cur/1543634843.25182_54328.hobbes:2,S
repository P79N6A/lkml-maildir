This week's kernel status update is available for general consumption at
  
http://www.kernelnewbies.org/status/
With the kernel summit and OLS this week, expect some changes to the 
feature list in the near future.  Feedback welcome for discussion!
Oh, and since feature freeze is apparently for Halloween 2002 (October 31), 
that makes it only 127 days left to get your pet project in...  ;-)
Enjoy!
