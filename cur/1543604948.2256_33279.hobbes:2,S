Hello everyone,
Alan, you're cc'd as an FYI, don't apply this until you get
verification from someone who knows the quota code ;-)
dqput_blocks can return 0 when dqput might decide to call
commit_dqout.  This is bad because remove_inode_dquot_ref
is called with the inode_lock held, and commit_dquot can
trigger schedules or another attempt on the inode_lock.
This is working for me:
