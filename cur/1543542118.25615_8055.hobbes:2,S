Hi.
Another driver move-around mixup. drivers/media/video/stradis.c really
needs ibmmpeg2.h and cs8420.h. Unfortunately, they were left behind
in drivers/char when stadis.c was moved. The patch to fix this can be 
fetched from www.jaquet.dk/kernel/patches/stradis.headers.patch or 
oneself can perform the appropriate 'mv' command.
