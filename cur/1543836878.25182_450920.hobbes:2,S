If a process has sufficient rights to move a file to a new container
then it should be okay to assign the file to the new container.  
Though the point is, if a resource (like file) is getting migrated to a
new container then all the attributes (like owner, #pages in memory
etc.) attached to that resource (file) should also migrate to this new
container.  Otherwise the semantics of where does the resource belong
becomes very difficult.
And if you really want a resource to not be able to migrate from one
container then we could define IMMUTABLE flag to indicate that behavior.
