Just to add some words about this, the older patch doesn't have support
for my Radeon 9600 Pro (RV350 chipset AP), so I tried the new one,
which has support, but only that, the new one is what Kristofer told
here among other things. So I added (just guessing, no idea if that was
right, for fun maybe) the PCI_IDs and RV350 checks in some places
of the old driver (I'm pretty sure they're all wrong), compiled and tried.
The old driver works *just fine* with my Radeon 9600, I only have a little
character distortion when trying to show the default linux logo, it shows 
without problems my customized logo, strange this. I can switch from X
without any trouble and the console looks fine.
I did this for kernel version prior to linux-2.6.0-test9 there are a new fbdev
patch but I added the radeonfb_setup function to it, it wasn't compiling
, not taking arguments from the kernel command line video=...., and 
has the same behaviour as the new driver.
Salu2.
