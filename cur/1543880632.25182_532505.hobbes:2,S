Ok.  I don't see any patches in -mm so I was assuming these patches have
not been queued up anywhere.
As long as these things happen in a reasonably timely manner so I can
remove the export of kernel_thread and kill daemonize I really don't care.
If you have written them they are quite likely better then my minimal
patches which were quite restrained because of my limited ability to
test these things.
