After reading most of this thread, it seems that Linus is of the view that all
three of these suck in one way or another. Suspend2 has the most features and is
the fastest of the lot. It can behave like swsusp from the user's point of view
(i.e. echo disk > /sys/power/state), so the migration should be seamless for
most distros. It isn't complicated to set up. It's been proven in the field. It
looks pretty.
So, while we're waiting for the next STD technology, why not have the best and
develop from there?
