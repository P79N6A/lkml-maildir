Do we really care in the kernel? We simply never use function pointer 
casts like this for anything non-trivial, so if the graph analysis just 
doesn't work for those cases, do we really even care?
The only case I can _remember_ us doing this for is literally the 
error-returning functions, where the call graph finding them really 
doesn't matter, I think.
So I don't _object_ to that reason, I just wonder whether it's really a 
big issue..
