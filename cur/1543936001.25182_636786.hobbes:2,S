We're seeing different numbers in each allocator indicating that the
ordering of allocations is not stable. When fragmentation occurs, it
magnifies the underlying instability. On my config, where the split list
combats fragmentation extremely effectively, the stability is quite
good.
Perhaps I'll add a printk to allocs and generate some size histograms.
lguest + grep = relayfs for dummies.

I've got:
gcc version 4.2.3 20080102 (prerelease) (Debian 4.2.2-5)
BusyBox v1.2.1 (2006.11.01-11:21+0000) Built-in shell (ash)
