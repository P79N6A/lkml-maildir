The error isn't in the kernel, it's between the chair and the keyboard.
You have created a lowmem zone of a size that doesn't correctly
align with the largest blocks used by the buddy allocator.

Then you'll need to choose a different size for the highmem=
parameter, one that doesn't cause an unaligned boundary.
Alternatively, you could submit a patch so the highmem= boot
option parsing code does the aligning for you.
However, that would simply be an improvement to the kernel and
nothing like a bug you can demand to get fixed now.
