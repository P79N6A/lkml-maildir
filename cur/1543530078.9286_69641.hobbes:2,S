Subject: [patch] 2.3.51 -- add ``nolock'' and ``lock'' options to nfs mounts

When talking to a unfsd on 2.0.28+logo, 2.3.51 generates an amazing amount of
diagnostic messages all helpfully reminding me that, yes, there's still no
lock daemon running on the other end, just like there wasn't 10 seconds ago.
There are more serious problems with the nfs client (like it dropping half
the contents of directories while doing readdir :-() but this one seems to
be easy to patch around.   It works for me(tm), and my inexperienced eye
doesn't seem to see anything wrong with it.
