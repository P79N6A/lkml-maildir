Subject: [PATCH] cpufreq annoying warning fix

Hi !
The cpufreq core patch I sent earlier got only half-applied. I added a
flag to let the low level driver disable an annoying warning on
suspend/resume that is normal on ppc, but the "resume" part of it wasn't
applied. This patch just adds back that missing bit. The original patch
also reworked the resume() function to avoid nesting too many if ()
statements along the way I did the suspend() one, but I didn't include
that in the patch below.
