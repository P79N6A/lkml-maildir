I have a similar problem on the VirtuHammer simulator. On trying to access
the virtual disk using PIO mode the simular breaks with an error
in a rep ; outsb loop complaining about "writing data while in data in phase".
I guess your problem could be the same, as the DVD is likely accessed
using PIO. 2.5.10 fails, 2.5.9 works.
