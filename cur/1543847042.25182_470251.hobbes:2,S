Hello Andrew,
this e-mail will be followed by two patches related to the UART driver for PNX8xxx MIPS platform.
The first one is a fixup for the serial header that fixes the compilation breakage for the very platform. The second one adds the UART driver functionality to the kernel. The driver itself is the one accepted by rmk in August but for some reason not included in the latest commits.
