spaces _and_ characters. And characters are already used to separate 
different fields. 
pcmcia:pa"some string"pb"some other string"
doesn't look bad though, indeed. Problem is: how to access the strings in 
file2alias.c? They're in different sections than the __mod_devicetables, and
you'd need to get architecture-dependant relocation... so this doesn't seem 
feasible... or am I missing something?
