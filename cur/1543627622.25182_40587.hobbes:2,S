Conceptually, sure, but the underlying macros Linus suggested made it
do/while. As the do/while form is the only control structure in C where we
have something that looks like an expression after a block, naming it for_
seems terribly incongruous. Naming it do_/while_ would make it slightly
less ugly, at least to my eyes, and serve to remind that both parts are
essential.
