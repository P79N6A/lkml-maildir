They wouldn't. We are talking about hardware specific stuff here e.g.
SCSI device drivers, Netfinity Manager et cetera. The licensing issues
for these software pieces are just under evaluation, not whether IBM is
going to modify the kernel itself and put it under a separate license. So
please: speculation about this is counterproductive here. 
The folks preparing the decision are very Linux knowledgable.
Don't be paranoid folks.
