When a tilt is detected, it would park the heads ? so that it would not 
affected from the larger shock ?
The platter/head is affected in a case where the arm swings away, even from 
the powerful magnet to crash against the platter. If the arm is locked, such 
that it does not move when a tilt is detected, (The tilt before the shock) 
the arm is parked and locked (more locking than the simple magnet) ?
