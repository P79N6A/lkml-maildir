Ross, your patch is pretty damn stable.. I had to shut down the PC today
due to expected wiring changes (lucky, a blackout came before the wiring
changes!).. the PC was at over 8 days uptime. At first I thought the box
was cooler.. now my observations are as follows:
At idle and under load the motherboard temp is 1-2C lower.
At idle the CPU is about the same
When compiling it gets to be a bit hotter than before but I have taken
one fan offline so I'm not sure of the result but its still only reaches
45C. I'll try again soon with the 2nd fan on and see what its like.
