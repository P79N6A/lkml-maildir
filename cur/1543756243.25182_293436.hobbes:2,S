The warning is printed right after the image is restored (ie somewhere
around the local_irq_enable() above, but it goes before the
"PM: Image restored successfully." message that is printed as soon as
the return is executed).  Definitely, less than 1 s passes between
the resoring of the image and the warining.
BTW, I've also tried to put touch_softlockup_watchdog() before
device_power_up(), but it didn't change much.

Yes.
