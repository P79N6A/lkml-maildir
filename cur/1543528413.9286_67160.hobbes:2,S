Hi, 
I sent this message to Richard Gooch thinking it was devfs that broke the
fddi-driver, but I guess I was wrong.. Anybody else have problems getting
FDDI to work with the latest kernels?
The machine is a uniprocessor Pentium 200 MMX with one DEFPA FDDI card and 
one 3c509 used for IPv6. It works fine with  2.3.42, but not with 47/48.

Subject: fddi and devfs
Hi, 
congratulations for finally getting devfs in, but ... (I'm sending this
directly to you, since I've got the impression from l-k that that's the way
you want it) 
I'm having some problems. It seems to me that devfs doesn't work with FDDI 
network devices.  The fddi interface was working perfectly with 2.3.42.
During the boot everything seems OK:
defxx.c:v1.04 09/16/96  Lawrence V. Stefani (stefani@lkg.dec.com)
fddi0: DEFPA at I/O addr = 0xDF80, IRQ = 10, Hardware addr = 08-00-2B-B2-9C-CD
but when I try to ifconfig it up, it fails.

I'm no kernel hacker, so I don't know how to fix this myself, but I would
be glad to give you access to the machine (the ethernet interface is
working perfectly) if you want to have a look.
