Subject: one packet per sk_buff?

After digging through skbuff.[ch] (and possibly other files that now elude
me), it seems to me that the kernel expects to find precisely one
(complete) packet per each sk_buff struct that's passed up to it by a
driver. Is that correct? Just trying to make sure, as it has certain
implications for a driver I'm writing (for 2.3 kernels).
Thanks,
