You are right: considering current CPUs there could be no performance
problem at all. Removing LOCKs for older ones should probably matter
more, but as a matter of fact, now I wouldn't bet even on this - it
could be mostly noop as well.

I've different opinion on this: I expect any spec to describe current
implementation. Before issuing new models any changes of
implementation should be made public with proper margin of time. Then
system could be optimally adjusted to a real hardware, instead of
planned only, but possibly never realized (plus doing such not used
things with old means is usually more costly: lock vs. lfence). There
is still problem of specs' completness: there are probably often some
things unspecified which could brake on a new model, so never 100%
guarantee anyway.

But, if you follow the spec - you don't follow the spec! Why do you
ignore so much this part of Intel's spec:
 "This document contains information which Intel may change at any
  time without notice. Do not finalize a design with this information."
Maybe it's a real Intel intention and not for lawyers only? (Btw, it
seems we have an example.)
