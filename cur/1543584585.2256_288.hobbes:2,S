Hmm... I was compiling usb-uhci and uhci directly into the kernel,
then visor.o as a module.
In any case, I can't load any modules under ac14.  None.  I get
complaints about unmatched symbols.  Really fun when /home is on a fs
compiled as a module...
ac13 + crypto works with usb-uhci, usb-serial, and visor as modules.
No problems.
I've gone back and (re)tested with kernels 2.4.1, 2.4.2, ac[36],
ac1[01234].  I can only get a crash on ac12 and ac13.  2.4.2 is broken
after all, and everything after it.  2.4.2 and the ac kernels seem to
fail on 'pilot-xfer /dev/usb/tts/1 -m scsi.pdb' (to install a zTXT
into gutenpalm, doesn't matter what I'm sending), and things seem to
go slower and have more problems as the versions increase.  Then I can
crash the system under ac12 and 13.  This is using uhci compiled
directly into kernel, with usb-serial and visor as modules.
If uhci + visor is unsupported, might I suggest the following change
to Configure.help to warn people?
