Actually, if you want to get really gross, you don't even need to sacrafice
a bit, since the MS_{RENAME,AFTER,BEFORE,OVER} only needs log2(5) bits.
So you just make the top 3 bits:
	000 - plain mount
	001 - MS_RENAME
	010 - MS_AFTER
	011 - MS_BEFORE
	100 - MS_OVER
	101 - undefined
	110 - old-stle C0ED mount
	111 - undefined
Of course, since I've made a duggestion that gross, Al's probably going to
hunt me down, so I'm going to go hide now :-)  Seriously, though, a new
mount syscall is probably the best idea at this point.
One other question though - Al mentioned that MS_ODD_RENAME should really
go into ->s_type->fs_flags... so why not move it?
  % grep MS_ODD_RENAME `find . -type f`
  ./namei.c:	if (!(old_dir->i_sb->s_flags & MS_ODD_RENAME)) {
  ./nfs/inode.c:	sb->s_flags |= MS_ODD_RENAME; /* This should go away */
