I hope you will continue to allow changes like new drivers and the
like, there are many things in 2.6 which are not only not working but
unlikely to ever be fixed because they are "old technology" and have
been replaced by more interesting and less functional alternatives, but
which are highly useful for people who have to use what is available in
terms of hardware.
That's "what the client/boss what's to provide" as well as "what the
individual can afford." It's not just hobby stuff or old PCs being used,
there are people selling laptops with ACPI more disfunctional than the
Simpsons. Suspend via APM works fine, though.
Unless a miracle occurs it will take as long for 2.6 to be really stable
and fully functional as it did for 2.[024]. When it goes out in distros
and gets abused by users for a while the sharp corners will be broken off.
