Well IIRC it is possible to prevent that by switching the blockdev to  
read-only mode first:
root@ares:~# mount /dev/hda6 /mnt
kjournald starting.  Commit interval 5 seconds
EXT3 FS on hda6, internal journal
EXT3-fs: mounted filesystem with ordered data mode
root@ares:~# umount /mnt
root@ares:~# blockdev --setro /dev/hda6
root@ares:~# mount /dev/hda6 /mnt
mount: block device /dev/loop0 is write-protected, mounting read-only
kjournald starting.  Commit interval 5 seconds
EXT3-fs: mounted filesystem with ordered data mode
