Thanks.  Actually, I was able to remove the route, but it still appeared
in the routing table until I updated to net-tools 1.49, which was
confusing.. I hadn't updated because the changes.html page on linuxhq said
it was only needed for IPv6, which I wasn't using... 
With the new net-tools, it looks better, and ifconfig no longer shows all
the packets as errors either, so it appears that the problem is mostly a
documentation thing. I should notify the linuxhq maintainer that net-tools
is a required update even for IPv4...

I don't mind that it gets it wrong... It was wrong in 2.0.36 too, but I
was unable to fix it.  So, I was getting visions of NT - setting up things
wrong and then not allowing it to be fixed :-).

Yep, the reason is that I don't have control over the router...  It's my
ISP's property.  Plus, they probably would not want to waste 2 addresses
per customer (net and broadcast) to do it that way. 
thanks,
