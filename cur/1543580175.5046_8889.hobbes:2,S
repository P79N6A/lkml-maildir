Relative to some performance questions folks have asked, the SCI 
adapters are limited by PCI bus speeds.  If your system supports 
64-bit PCI you get much higher numbers.  If you have a system 
that supports 100+ Megabyte/second PCI throughput, the SCI 
adapters will exploit it.
This test was performed in on a 32-bit PCI system with a PCI bus
architecture that's limited to 70 MB/S.
