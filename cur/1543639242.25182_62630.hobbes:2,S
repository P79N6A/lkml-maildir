Hi All,
I am facing a problem with the REALTEK Ethernet driver. I have a
RTL8139C realtek chip in my board.
When I transmit the packet out, the packet is coming out as all
0's. I dumped the whole packet in rtl1839_start_xmit (). The
packet is a proper ARP packet. When i captured the packet using
sniffer, the packet came out with all 0's.
Can any body throw some light on this?
with best regards,
Nanda
