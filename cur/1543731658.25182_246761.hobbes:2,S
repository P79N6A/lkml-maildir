Nonsense. The .iso or .tar or whatever would have to be kept un-isoed or
un-tarred in memory (or on disk cache) for this to be true, and that takes
quite a long time. Each time you want to peek anew at linux/Makefile, the
whole tarfile will have to be read and stored somewhere, and that is just
too slow for my taste. The .tar format is optimized for compact storage,
the on-disk format of a filesystem is optimized for fast access and
modifiability. Now go ahead and enlarge a file on your .iso/.tar a bit...it
will take ages to rebuild the whole thing. There is a _reason_ why there
are filesystems and archives, and they use different formats. If it weren't
so, everybody and Aunt Tillie would just carry .ext3's around, and would
wonder what the heck all this fuss is about.

Perpetuum mobile is a nice idea too.
