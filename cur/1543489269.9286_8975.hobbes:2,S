Huh??? It is done in nfs_lookup() and there is no way for dentry to become
hashed and/or be passed to methods without ->lookup() approving it. All
static checks (e.g. name length if the limit can't change) are done there.
All methods except ->lookup() get dentries already in dcache, positive or
negative. If lookup() refused to call d_add() and returned an error dentry
will be silently dropped and will never make its way to other methods.
