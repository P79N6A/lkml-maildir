Yeah you are right, on 64-bit platforms that could have happened. I
actually thought that CONTIGUOUS_BUFFERS took care of 4GB, but on
checking it does not.
So clustering should have been disabled then (which in the in-kernel
drive it is not). Now both 2.4 and 2.6 make that guarentee. The only
argument for disabling clustering would be for 2.4 for CPU cycle
reasons.
