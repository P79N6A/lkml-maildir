I'm not convinced.

Interesting. If that were done, my last sound card wouldn't have worked at all
under Linux: it had to be initialised under DOS before loading Linux. Had Linux
then reset everything, I'd have been soundless!

Either it initialises it (as it does, in this case), and I want (even NEED) it
to STAY initialised (i.e. if your driver does an unnecessary reset, your driver
is broken), or it doesn't, and I'll reset the card with an ioctl.

So provide the FACILITY to reset the card, IFF it is needed. There are cases
where resetting the card is just stupid: don't force stupidity by design into
the kernel.

I prefer the idea of the drivers which need this coming with a suitable
interface (/dev or /proc item) and a script to do this when needed.
