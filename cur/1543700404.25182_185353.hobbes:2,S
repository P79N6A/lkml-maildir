Although I agree on the race, I fail to see in what case it matters.
In my programs, I often use mkdir() to get temporary directories instead
of temporary files, just because of the atomicity of the test-and-set which
mkdir() provides. Basically, I do :
  base_dir="/tmp/tmpdir"; 
  do {
     rnd=random();
     sprintf(dir, "%s%d", base_dir, rnd);
  } while (!mkdir(dir, 0700);
  /* now I'm guaranteed that I'm the first to get this dir, */
  /* and only my UID can work in it */
  chdir(dir);
  
So the only race would be someone working with the same UID (or root) removing
the directory and replacing it with another one (or a symlink or anything)
between mkdir() and chdir(). But don't see any use or consequence to this.

It would be interesting, of course, but is it portable to other systems ? If
it is not, very few people will use it, unfortunately. But if others already
do it right, then why not include it ?
Cheers,
Willy
