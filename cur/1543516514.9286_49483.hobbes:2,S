Hello,
  I got this morning a lot of these messages. What does that mean?
(problem with flushing TLB on CPU#0 ?)
  HW:  BP6 motherboard + 2 x 500MHz Intel Celeron (Mendocino)
  I noticed the problems with overheating of processors on BP6
motherboards, but I think, this is not the problem (processors have around
46 degrees of Celsius and after rebooting the systems works fine, it
seems)
