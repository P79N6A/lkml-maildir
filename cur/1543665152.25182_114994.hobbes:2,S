It's already part of the documented ABI.  Yes, if right now somebody
said r11 or whatever is declared the thread register, we could change
it.  But give it a few more weeks and it'll probably be impossible.

The kernel just corresponds to what userland expects.  It's the same for
otherarchitectures where clone() loads the appropriate register.

I'm not sure what your plans wrt to set_thread_area in 64-bit mode are
but I would strongly suggest to remove it completely.

Yes.

You don't understand threads.  There is nothing broken or NPTL-specific
about the design.  Every thread creation mechanism must be signal save.
 LinuxThreads's is not, which is a bit less of a problem since the
signal handling is broken, too, and signals are unlikely to arrive at
the new thread. Nevertheless, there are certainly spurious crashes which
are hard to reproduce and explain which can be attributed to this problem.
With fixed signal handling the newly created thread needs to have a
valid and correct thread register from the first instruction on and this
can only be implemented in the kernel.  Again, the other archs implement
similar dependencies.  ia-64 loads the tp register with the given value.
 The kernel doesn't live in a vacuum so this kind of dependency is OK.

Sure.  Write this in the ABI docs.  Or leave the whole segment register
handling undefined so that nobody gets the idea it's useful to use.

Switching to zero is only correct when using the MSR.  I'm talking about
the case when the value is used as the base address of a segment.  In
that case %fs has to be loaded with the value corresponding to the
apppropriate GDT index.  The loading can happen in the kernel (or when
returning from it) or left to the user.  I think the former is better
since it corresponds more cleanly to what happens if the MSR is used.
If you don't want it return the GDT index and the user code will have to
issue the mov instruction if the return index is != 0 (indicating the
MSR is used).

Thanks, looking forward to that.
