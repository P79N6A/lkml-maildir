What about recycling a big-endian version of cramfs? IIRC, the format is 
really clean, it already does compression, and is terse enough to be efficent 
for booting purposes. However, it might be too terse as it:
1) Doesn't support hard links
2) Doesn't store atime/mtime/ctime
I don't know if that'd be too restrictive for an initrd replacement, but 
having only one compressed-filesystemish filesystem for the kernel would be 
nice.
