I see that the two mechanisms could have conflicting requirements. But
surely this is the case whether we merge the two into one integrated
system, or try to run CKRM and cpusets independantly at the same time? 
I'd think the problems would be easier to tackle if the systems knew
about each other, and talked to each other.
I don't think anyone is suggesting that either system as is could replace
the other ... more that a combined system could be made for both types
of resource control that would be a better overall solution.
