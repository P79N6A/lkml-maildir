As the subject says, with 2.3.31 I cannot use the ne2k-pci ethernet driver
as a module: the module it depends on (8390.o) is not build nor installed.
The 8390 driver gets built, as I find a 8390.o in drivers/net/, but trying
to load that doesn't work (ie insmod reports that there is no version
information in the .o file).  As well as the fact that compiling the
driver into the kernel works.
Please cc me any replies as needed as I'm not on the list.
