typedefs are more readable to my eyes, so if they're there it's more
debuggable, infact I liked when Ingo tried to inject the page_t thing
(was him Ingo or somebody else?)

I see what you mean now, I agree.

I know this would be expected (this is what happens with arch too in the
explicit mode, the one that I prefer to be strict in the commits), but I
was just trying to say that Miles theory is that BK gets it right
automatically, either that or Linus's scripts gets it right before
injecting it into bk, that is his whole point. Miles sent to Linus
_patches_ (obviously w/o bk, AFIK Miles is not legally allowed to use bk
and Larry even refused him to sell him a commercial licence of bk so
that Miles could use bk while still working on arch) renaming files, and
he then found the renames being catched correctly in the web.

It may not be bk catching the renames but just an external script that
Linus uses. I don't know.

Not sure after all those discussions how you may not have ever noticed
that people uses objrmap to mean something different than rmap, it's
really hard to believe that you never noticed.
