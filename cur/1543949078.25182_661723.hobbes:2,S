Ah, thanks for the reminder. The last I tried it, it didn't show
anything other than scheduler: waiting on cpu, but using a git clone
version captured this almost immediately:
EXT3: Waiting for journal access                  2261.1 msec         15.0 %
Writing a page to disk                            112.4 msec          0.7 %

I'm running postgresql in the background on this system and it does
regular sync's, so perhaps that's related?
It doesn't look like latencytop saves the trace data anywhere other
than my eyes? I'll hack in a log and see what else it gets.
