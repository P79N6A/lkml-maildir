Firstly, this is not a fundamental property of epoll. If we wanted to, 
it would be possible to extend epoll to fill in a ring of events from 
the wakeup handler. It's an incremental add-on to epoll that should not 
impact the design. How much info to put into a single event is another 
incremental thing - for most of the high-performance cases all the 
information we need is the type of the event and the fd it occured on. 
Currently epoll supports that minimal approach.
Secondly, our current syscall overhead is below 0.1 usecs on latest 
hardware:
  dione:~/l> ./lat_syscall null
  Simple syscall: 0.0911 microseconds
so you need millions of events _per cpu_ for the syscall overhead to 
show up.
Thirdly, our main problem was not the structure of epoll, our main 
problem was that event APIs were not widely available, so applications 
couldnt go to a pure event based design - they always had to handle 
certain types of event domains specially, due to lack of coverage. The
latest epoll patches largely address that. This was a huge barrier
against adoption of epoll.
