This is indeed a bug, and ymfpci inherits it from cs46xx.c.
I wonder why cs46xx.c does not trigger a warning.
Since the check never worked and nobody ever complained,
I think the best fix is to remove the "if" statement with
its block. If we repair the comparison to "eid == 0xFFFF",
then we run a risk of breaking previously working systems.
