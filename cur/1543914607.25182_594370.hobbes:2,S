I can understand that logic.

Nothing, the end result is more or less the same. There are three style
cleanups in the restack and for some reason, one of the functions moved
but otherwise they are identical.
The restacked version was provided to illustrate what the final stack really
looks like and because I thought you would prefer it over a stack that had
one patch introducing a change and a later patch removing it (like making
it configurable for example). It also allowed us to test against mainline
to make sure everything was ok prior to the merge.
Go ahead with the patches you already
have if you prefer. Just make sure not to include
breakout-page_order-to-internalh-to-avoid-special-knowledge-of-the-buddy-allocator.patch
as it's only required for page-owner-tracking.
Thanks Andrew.
