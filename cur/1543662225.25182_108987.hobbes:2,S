Full agreement here.  If the LSM stuff actually was discussed on the
appropinquate list (lkml) we probably wouldn't have much of this mess.

First making it a _module_ is silly.  In fact the idea of security
_modules_ is very bad - you need early initialization to have prope
labelling of all objects and subjects in the system.
Having DAC optional by itself sounds like a silly idea, but if it is
a fallout of a generic security model I don't see any reason why we
shouldn't allow it.
