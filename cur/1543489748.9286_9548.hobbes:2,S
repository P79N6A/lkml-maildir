I think I found it. There was a race in async ICMP error handling when a signal
occurred at the right time. After the system call was restarted there was
no check for an already pending error in the blocking case, after it went
to sleep it never woke up again because no one called sk->error_report again.
This patch should fix it.

David, Alexey, what do you think?
