Please explain where counter reset capability provides any 
functionality that is not already available without it.
You might want to read RFC2724 ``Traffic Flow Measurement''.
Search for ``reset''.
Counter resets have always caused problems, that's why mission 
critical counters never have a reset.  Have you ever seen an
electricity, gas or water meter with a reset?  The same reasoning
applies when you have accounting rules that are used to charge
customers for traffic volume.

You are confused.  What would you say if a close() by another,
unrelated application closed all open descriptors for that file,
including the one you just opened?  Just fix your applications?
