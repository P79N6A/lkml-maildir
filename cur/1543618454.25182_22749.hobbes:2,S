X, true, and false are of type int.
If one tests X==false and then later on tests X==true, how does the
compiler know the entire domain has been tested?  With a boolean, it
would.  Or a switch statement... if both true and false are covered,
there is no need for a 'default'.  Similar arguments apply for
enumerated types.
