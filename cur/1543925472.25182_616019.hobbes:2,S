memory mapped registers should be read with readw and friends and that
should contain the volatile not the public code.
Similarly spin_lock/unlock are store barriers so for ring buffers should
be sufficient unless you have cache management requirements in which case
the dma_* APIs will handle those bits.
Knocking these sort of things on the head does want doing, we are still
having to clean up ancient drivers/platforms that don't do this and
frequently break as a result.

Send bugs to the maintainer. You've triggered a new case - adding an arch
and it gets the wrong idea.

No - its rather dumb on rule handling and will need a rewrite someday to
handle typedefs as well.
