Is anyone else getting these ANNOYING messages?  (Attached at
bottom) I've been getting them for 2 weeks now.  I wrote a rude
obnoxious letter to the folk there, was told to fuck off, to
which I replied basically the same. 
A few days after that, I got a polite request from a
yahoo/hotmail/geocities/wherever account stating that they were
the sysadmin of this site, and were looking into the problem due
to my polite (yeah right) request.
Since I was in a bad mood when I originally wrote the site,
telling them off, I apologized for my rudeness, and offered to
try and help track down the problem if I could.  I don't believe
I received a reply back.
<VENT>
Now I just keep getting these stupid damned messages.  I'm
assuming that everyone else on l-k is getting them too.
So, could someone please do one of the following:
1) Send a copy of the O'Reilly book on Sendmail configuration to:
   postmaster@necon.se
2) Block postings to linux-kernel from *@necon.se
3) Please send me an Omnigate super duper sending license (I'd
   prefer a wall mountable 14x11 copy if possible).
4) Do repetitive nmap scans in the necon.se domain with an
   attempt to bring down all of their machines and/or gain access
   and/or break root and fix their broken friggen configuration.
</VENT>
