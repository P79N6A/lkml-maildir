Thanks Bill for the patch, I'll merge it into hotfix 4 which I'll
probably release on next week (no urgent fix needed yet). My DS10
(21264) already builds and runs plain 2.4.31 fine, because it does
not use ns87312.

Those boxes are wonderful. Mine serves as a gigabit fileserver at
only 466 MHz :-)
Thanks,
