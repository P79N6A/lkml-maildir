Upgrade LILO to lilo-21, read the docs, and compile with 
-DLARGE_EBDA
Some of these SMP machines use larger than normal extended bios 
data areas. 
The box here that had the problem was a "Digital Server 1000"
Thanks to the people who pointed this one out to me.
Incidentally, you can also bypass the problem using "initrd",
man mkinitrd for details.
