Hi,
Yes, I'm using lvm 1.1rc1 on top of raid0. Hardware details:
dual piii box on via Apollo pro133 chipset (via694)
two ATA-100 drives (FUJITSU MPG3204AH) attached to on-board  controller
(PROMISE 20265)
& one drive attached to VIA controller. RAID0 is made on top of first two
drives.
1. I don't have any problem with drive attached to via controller (in DMA33
mode)
2. The only problem that I have is with UDMA100 drives attached to promise
controller... Also I have to notice that log messages about ide errors are
related to drive that has no errors (according to smartctl -l, while another
drive has a few records in its log)
3. I had no problems with ide with 2.4.7 kernel for a months...
