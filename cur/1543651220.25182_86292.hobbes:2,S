Ehh. With the nosuid mount that will remove the effectiveness of the suid
bit (not just the user change - it will also mask off the elevation of the
capabilities), so the bind-mount with the capability mask will now mask
off nothing to start with.
Wouldn't it be much nicer to have:
  /usr/bin/foo - no suid bits, no capabilities by default
  mount --bind --capability=xx,yy /usr/bin/foo /usr/bin/foo
where the mount actually adds capabilities? Looks more understandable to
me.
