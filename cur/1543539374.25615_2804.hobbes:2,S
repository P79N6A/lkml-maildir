Useless. If you have acheived root privileges you can just substitute the
ide drivers or load a module that bypasses all the checks. Now, if the
securelevel system or the capabilities system become solid enough there
will be a good reason for this patch. In fact it is necessary. 
At the moment it is not a problem though. As root you can reflash the disk
through some use of ioremap. You can even reflash the bios. Perhaps
someone can even figure out a way to abuse the microcode updates of an
Intel chip to fry the cpu. 
At the moment I don't think it is a very high priority. It is a
preparation for the future but i suspect there are more pressing problems.
