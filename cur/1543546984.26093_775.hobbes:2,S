Would it be possible to make fork() or clone() from a process whose tgid!=pid
reparent the child to the thread group leader automatically? Thus, when the
creating thread goes away, the child is still a child of the "process", and
SIGCHLD is still going to go to the process (leader thread).
Also all child "processes" and "threads" are then logically children of the
"process", given that a "process" is then defined by the tgid.
Also my 2p on the execve() problem: if the master thread does an execve(),
there must be a point of no return, at which point all the child threads
should be deleted, IMHO, otherwise they turn into full processes in their own
right, and the thread-signalling framework goes out the window.
And for a further thought on the subject, is it possible for when a child
thread does an execve(), to wangle the master thread into making this call,
with all other threads SIGSTOP'd until completion (& death) or failure (&
resumption)? (though that's probably better done in userspace)
