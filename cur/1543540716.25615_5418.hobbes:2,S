I don't have windows ;-) not that I couldn't install it on the other HD
i'd have to partition and I dont wanna :-)
I dont know if this drive should be "blacklisted" since it is a UDMA33/66
drive on a real PC (unlike this Pentium 200 w/o MMX)
Yes, If I copy from one channel to the other i get IRQ DMA timeouts from
the Fujitsu drive. The WD and CD-ROM are on the primary channel the
Fujitsu is on the secondary channel as master. I dont see how the CD-Rom
would affect the drive.
