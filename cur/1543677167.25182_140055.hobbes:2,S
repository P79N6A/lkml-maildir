Nothing to do with TCPA: my laptop doesn't have one, and it objects to
"foreign" wireless cards.  Plain old BIOS is enough.
Fortunately IBM support the Cisco Airo 350 mini-pci card, and supply a
(GPLed) driver.  It isn't the greatest driver (no 2.5 port, seems flakey
when doing anything with the admin tool, no wireless extension support),
but it works enough to make wireless useful.
