  Had to rebuild a machine due to a dead deathstar.  It's 99% there at
this point I think except I can't log in via xterm, eterm or ssh.
Poking around, the most obvious factor is that /dev/pts is empty.
I can see that /dev and /dev/pts mounted by using "df -k /dev /dev/pts"
which returns:
Filesystem	1K-blocks	Used	Available	Use%	Mounted on
-		0		0	0		-	/dev
devpts		0		0	0		-	/dev/pts
whish is identicle to the machine I'm currently logged into and is
working fine.  /dev and /dev/pts are both compiled into the kernel and
are reported by "cat /proc/filesystms".  Devfsd is up and running with a
command line of "/sbin/devfsd /dev".
Anyone have any idea why this is malfunctioning?
Robert
