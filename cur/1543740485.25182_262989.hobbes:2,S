Ok. So the end result ends up pretty simple:
	static int maydump(struct vm_area_struct *vma)
	{
	        /* Do not dump I/O mapped devices, shared memory, or special mappings */        
	        if (vma->vm_flags & (VM_IO | VM_SHARED | VM_RESERVED))
	                return 0;
	        /* If it hasn't been written to, don't write it out */
	        if (!vma->anon_vma)
	                return 0;
	        return 1;
	}
does this make everybody happy?
Do the core-files blow up a lot from this? Or does it miss some case?
