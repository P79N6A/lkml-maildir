That's interesting Thomasr. I get 18.4 s on the Athlon here vs 32.3 for Daniel's
(I have broken my function at the moment so I cannot re-bench it right now, but
it should be near Daniel's). At first, I thought you had coded an FFS instead of
an FLS. But I realized it's valid, and is fast because one half of the numbers
tested will not even take one iteration.
