You still need to list them as COMPATIBLE_IOCTL() or call
register_ioctl32_conversion(IOCTLNO, 0) when the ioctl has been
made compatible. Unless we are sure that every single ioctl
has been made compatible (probably never), the default must
be to call sys_ioctl from compat_sys_ioctl only if the number
is explicitly listed. This should solve both problems you
mentioned.
One minor remaining problem is that if multiple files contain
handlers for the same ioctl number, they have to be converted
at the same time because the number can not both be compatible
and incompatible at the same time.
