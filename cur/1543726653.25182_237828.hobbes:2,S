Not really, they really have nothing to do with the PCI state
at all. Besides, the difference between PCI D3 hot and D3 cold
is dependent on what happens on the mobo after the chip gets
set to D3...

No. The driver interface provide a semantic that indicates in what
state the system is going to, it's driver policy to translate that into
appropriate actions, eventually involving some bus power state (or not,
for some archs, we'll haev no choice but have some driver level arch
hacks in there anyway, like some macs wanting video chips to be in D2
state etc...)

That's an old problem, I don't know how to fix this one best in USB,
I've always had problem with the whole PM semaphore for that reasons
among others but I'll let Greg & Patrick find a solution there.

And who resumes it ? Or you just lockup as soon as your VM try to
swap in from the flash ? If it self-wakes up then it's driver internal
policy. Again, the PM interface exposed to the kernel and userland has,
imho, nothing to do with the actualy low level bus states.

And ? that's not the point. "standby" is defined as a kernel PM state
that could be used to implement that. It's per-driver policy to decide
how to react to "standby" of the HW can only do on/off (which usually
turns into go to "off" if the transition back to "on" is fast, or do
nothing if not).
There's also one thing we haven't dealt with is since queues are blocked
etc..., there need to be some explicit action waking things up. We don't
yet have provisions for devices themselves to trigger wakeup, either of
the whole tree, or themselves individually, based on activity. things like
USB remote wakeup usually hook through the firmware/motherboard to trigger
the system wakeup, but all of this is useless for such a standby state
where we actually want a pending request to the disk, for example, to
wakeup the whole subsystem.
