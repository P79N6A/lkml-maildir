Hi all,
New Linux 2.4 and 2.5 patches are now available from
http://sf.net/projects/acpi.
 Big thanks to the asus-acpi team, as well
as all the other people who have been tracking down bugs and submitting
fixes lately.
Regards -- Andy

Export acpi_disabled for sonypi (Stelian Pop)
Mention acpismp=force in config help
