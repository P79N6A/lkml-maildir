Your driver can use whatever name you wanted, as long as it's the
LANNANA name that you asked for and were assigned.  We do have standards
for a good reason, and the kernel will follow them.
That being said, have your customers use a tool like udev.  Then they
can name their tty devices whatever they want.  No limitations there at
all.
Hope this helps,
