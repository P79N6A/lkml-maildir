Um, no.  Should be ENTRY_COMP() if there's compat syscalls.  And those
particular syscall numbers have already been assigned (blame Linus for
dropping the PA-RISC patch on the floor instead of including it in 2.6.9).

conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
