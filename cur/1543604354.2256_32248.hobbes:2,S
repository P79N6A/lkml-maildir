Hi Folks,
I was looking for some scripts to backup ext2 partitions
to multiple CDR's when I stumbled onto "cdbackup" at
http://www.cableone.net/ccondit/cdbackup/.
Alas, there is a warning saying:
"WARNING! When using this program under Linux, be sure not to use
 dump with kernels in the 2.4.x series. Using dump on an ext2
 filesystem has a very high potential for causing filesystem
 corruption.  As of kernel version 2.4.5, this has not been
 resolved, and it may not be for some time."
I don't recall any problems like this, does anyone have
additional comments?
Regards,
Lew Wolfgang
