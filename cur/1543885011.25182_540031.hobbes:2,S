Subject: [PATCH] DLM: fix a couple of races

Hi,
There are the following two trivially-fixed races in fs/dlm/config.c:
1. The configfs subsystem semaphore must be held by the caller when 
calling config_group_find_obj(). It's needed to walk the subsystem 
hierarchy without racing with a simultaneous mkdir(2) or rmdir(2). I 
looked around to see if there was some other way we were avoiding this 
race, but couldn't find any.
2. get_comm() does hold the subsystem semaphore but lets go too soon -- 
before grabbing a reference on the found config_item. A concurrent 
rmdir(2) could come and release the comm after the up() but before the 
config_item_get().
Patch that fixes both these bugs below.
Cheers,
S
PS: For some reason, configfs still uses a struct semaphore (as a binary 
semaphore) for configfs_subsystem.su_sem. Someone with free time should 
convert that to a struct mutex, say configfs_subsystem.su_mtx -- which is 
the preferred way to use (binary) mutexes presently. CC'ing Joel Becker on 
this.

Fix two races in fs/dlm/config.c:
(1) Grab the configfs subsystem semaphore before calling 
config_group_find_obj() in get_space(). This solves a potential race 
between get_space() and concurrent mkdir(2) or rmdir(2).
(2) Grab a reference on the found config_item _while_ holding the configfs 
subsystem semaphore in get_comm(), and not after it. This solves a 
potential race between get_comm() and concurrent rmdir(2).
