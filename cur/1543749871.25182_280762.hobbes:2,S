Well something is deaccounting uncorrectly (doh), probably the disk/partition 
accounting logic is doing wrong in some condition, Jens?
void req_merged_io(struct request *req)
{
        struct hd_struct *hd1, *hd2;
        locate_hd_struct(req, &hd1, &hd2);
        if (hd1)
                down_ios(hd1);
        if (hd2)
                down_ios(hd2);
}
void req_finished_io(struct request *req)
{
        struct hd_struct *hd1, *hd2;
        locate_hd_struct(req, &hd1, &hd2);
        if (hd1)
                account_io_end(hd1, req);
        if (hd2)
                account_io_end(hd2, req);
}
We could eliminate that possibility if you ran your tests with a single 
non-partitioned disk, but thats just a guess.
Jens has more of a clue than I certainly.
