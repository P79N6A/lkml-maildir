aacraid does not seem to initialize if there is above 1-2 gigs of memory.
If I boot with mem=1000M , it works.
I tried to change the comminit.c file in the aacraid directory and 
played with the memory values, but it looks like it does not make a 
difference.
I am using 2.6.2 kernel.
If anybody knows anything about the issue, please let me know, because 
it is listed as solved on RedHat's bugzilla site and on other sites, 
which I visited, but it does not work still.
BTW the lower version kernel does not work either (2.6.1 with x86_64.org 
patches).
