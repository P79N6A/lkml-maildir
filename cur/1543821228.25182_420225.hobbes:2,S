EXPORT_UNUSED_SYMBOL() ? (with comment of date)
(well you didn't apply the patch for that I sent you so I suppose you
hate it ;)

compiletime warning is hard, because it would require changing
prototype, which is a lot more churn, and I'll bet a lot of exports
don't even have a prototype at all. modprobe time is easy. (middle
ground would be depmod time; that's almost compile time I suppose but a
lot easier, but might need modutils help)

comment is easy, putting a date in is really sucky since it grows the size of exports even more..
(which means people pay even more export tax than they do today)
