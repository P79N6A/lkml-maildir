This means to me it's the wrong abstraction for this.  We had a nice
solution for this with Evgeniy's kevent interfaces.  It worked without
forcing futexes is this inflexible poll() interface.

No.  This is why programs are forced to waste cycles by doing this.
Ideally this would not happen.  Ideally you'd park all worker thread
in the same place and have them woken up one by one.  Again, Evgeniy's
code was able to do this.  This approach seems to be a big step
backward.
