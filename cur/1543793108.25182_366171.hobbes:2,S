I could understand that concept except for one thing:
  - with 4k stacks turned on, i have the lockups
  - with 4k stacks turned off, i have not had a single lock up at all.
Per an earlier email from 'pageexec@freemail.hu', it appears that there is still an execution path in the kernel with is causing a stack overflow.
