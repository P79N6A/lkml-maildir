I've made it by the same time of timerfd, I even sent it to Davide and
the list. "Clone" is a bit of overstatment, timerfd is not bugged as this :)

Will move then all to another header later.

Return the remaing time for timer firing, or rearm the timer. And its
pretty broken because of the first if and I forgot to reset overruns.

See third comment! -- It will remain lockless, as reading and setting
this data type is guaranteed to happen atomically.

This has nothing to do with user space, or you got lost in comments
references.
