You don't have enough memory... you can probably tune bdflush to make the
system flush writes more aggressively, but one cause is that you fill all
available memory before bdflush even runs. Try setting the time way down,
say one sec, and see if things change.
Note that this may not make the system run faster in any significant way,
it may just get all the drive lights blinking.
