Yes, and there's a bug in there atm...

This initialisation is actually pointless here.

This is where it goes wrong.  Don't call early_serial_setup() after
"early".  Use a platform device instead.
I absolutely detest the number of ways to initialise an 8250 port -
I'd like there to be only one way, but that doesn't satisfy everyone.
That one way is via platform devices.  Please use that method in
preference to everything else, _especially_ from architecture code.
