With respect to SCSI transport, it would also make sense tolook at the 
implementations of various other platforms.

With fine grained privileges and a nice inherent user level framework, this 
kind of problems should not apear inside cdrecord at all.

One original issue was that ide-scsi did cause a kernel panic in case it
was used on top of PCMCIA based ATA.
The other issue is that ide-scsi does not do DMA in case DMA-size is not
a multiple of 512 while is is needed for any size % 4 == 0;
or at least size % 8 == 0

If this change had been announced early anough and if there was a workaround,
there would be no problem. The problem was that someone has a bad dream and
incompatibly changed the Linux kernel over night while cdrecord was in code 
freeze. Later I was called unflexible because I did follow the well known 
quality ensuring rules that are in effect short before a new stable/final 
released is published.

This are two problems:
-	users of cdrecord like to run cdrecord -scanbus in order to find all
	SCSI devices. This no longer works since the non-orthogonal /dev/hd* 
	SCSI transport has been added.
	As Linux already implements a Generic SCSI transport interface 
	(/dev/sg*) people would asume to be able to talk to _all_ SCSI devices
	using this interface. To allows this, there is a need for a 
	SCSI HBA driver that sends SCSI commands via a ATA interface.
-	some people seem to set the permissions of some of the /dev/hd* 
	nodes to unsafe values and then complain that the other /dev/hd* 
	nodes cannot be opened.
