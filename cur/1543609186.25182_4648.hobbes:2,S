   Before jumping to real conclusions it would be interesting to gather
   some statistics on Anton's machine, but I suspect he just has an very
   unevenly populated table.
N_PAGES / N_HASHCHAINS was on the order of 9, and the hash chains were
evenly distributed.  He posted URLs to graphs of the hash table chain
lengths.
Franks a lot,
