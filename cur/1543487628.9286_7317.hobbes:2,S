Well -- I never saw any evidence of extra bytes in my testing. It seems
unlikely that Solaris thinks that there is an extra byte because TCP
only passes over the sequence number of the first byte of data and 
the length of data is computed from the IP length. Also, Solaris
generates
an ACK indicating that it received all the data bytes but not the
virtual FIN control byte.
