Ah. That sounds much better.

I have never seen such a machine. A SMP machine with multiple 
"nodes"? So essentially one NUMA node has multiple discontig "nodes"?
This means that the concept of a node suddenly changes if there is just 
one numa node(CONFIG_NUMA off implies one numa node)?

s/CONFIG_NUMA/CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES?
That will not work because the idea is the localize the slabs to each 
node. 
If there are multiple nodes per numa node then invariable one node in the 
numa node (sorry for this duplication of what node means but I did not 
do it) must be preferred since numa_node_id() does not return a set of 
discontig nodes.
Sorry but this all sounds like an flaw in the design. There is no 
consistent notion of node. Are you sure that this is not a ppc64 screwup?
