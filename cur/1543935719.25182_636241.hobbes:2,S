Ok, but let's look at this a bit more opportunistic / optimistic.
Even after a black-out shutdown, the corruption is pretty minimal, using 
ext3fs at least.  So let's take advantage of this fact and do an optimistic 
fsck, to assure integrity per-dir, and assume no external corruption.  Then 
we release this checked dir to the wild (optionally ro), and check the next.  
Once we find external inconsistencies we either fix it unconditionally, 
based on some preconfigured actions, or present the user with options.
All this could be per-dir or using some form of on-the-fly file-block-zoning.
And there probably is a lot more to it, but it should conceptually be 
possible, with more thoughts though...
