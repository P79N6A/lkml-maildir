It may not matter too too much, but blocks are being passed around as
'ints'.  On the ia32 architecture, this implies a maximum of 512*2G->1T
disk size.  Probably don't need to worry about this today, but in a few
years?  Should we be changing the internal interfaces to use a long (or
a long unsigned -- why signed?) Maybe for 2.5/2.6 timeframe?  Just
curious...
