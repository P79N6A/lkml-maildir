Imagine taking an input, doing dsp-type calculations on it, and sending it back
as output.  Now...imagine doing it in realtime with the output being fed back to
a monitor speaker.  Think about what would happen if the output of the monitor
speaker is 1/4 second behind the input at the mike.  Now do you see the
problem?  A few ms of delay might be okay.  A few hundred ms definately is not.

If I'm trying to watch a DVD on my computer, and assuming my CPU is powerful
enough to decode in realtime, then I want the DVD player to take
priority--dropping frames just because I'm starting up netscape is not
acceptable.
