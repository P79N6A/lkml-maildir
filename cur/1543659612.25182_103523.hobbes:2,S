yup, much better. i did a little housecleaning on the whole file, as 
well as 2 more bounds checks in appropriate places.
i'm sorry to ask, but i'm new -- i've got a ~500 line patch, and my 
email client is wrapping at 80 chars (unfortunately some lines run over 
80 chars), is sending an attachment in ascii format ok? i've seen some 
patches sent as attachments, not sure.
waiting for a yes/no response, please cc me
