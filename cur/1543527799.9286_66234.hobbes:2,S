I reported on friday that 2.2.15pre10 on SPARC compiled with egcs-20000221
hangs on boot, not switching to the black background screen. After trying
console=prom (which somebody suggested here, thanks!), I can see the boot
messages. The latest message is "VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem)
readonly", init(8) doesn't start.
The same kernel, compiled with Red Hat's egcs-1.1.2-24 boots fine (that's
what I'm running right now), so it seems the compiler is to blame here.
2.2.15pre9 compiled with egcs-20000214 worked fine, that was what I ran
before.
Looks like some experiments are in order. But I'll wait for the next egcs
snapshot for that.
