Starting at 2.6.7-rc1 or so (that is when we first noticed it) the new
pilot-link libusb back end started deadlocking the entire USB bus that
the palm device was on.
I have finally tracked it down to happening when we make the
USBDEVFS_RESET ioctl, we never return from it and from that point on the
bus in question is completely dead, no processing is done, no
notifications of devices being plugged in or unplugged.
This is still happening in 2.6.7-rc2-mm1.
It seems to happen with both the UHCI and OHCI back ends, so it is
probably above that.
Given that there were heavy locking changes, I suspect that the case in
question got screwed up somehow.
