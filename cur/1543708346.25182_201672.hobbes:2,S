i did so, but it revealed not much (any?) more information:

for the record:
root@sheep:~# cat /proc/sys/vm/vm_gfp_debug
1
root@sheep:~#
some thoughts of mine:
after setting vm_gfp_debug to 1 i run the benchmarks again, with a 200MB 
  testfile (within a 700MB fs, setup via cryptoloop). in the log the 
messages from above showed up, but this time the benchmark was able to 
finish, the system was *never unusable* during the test (like i was 
experienceing with former kernels too). but: i don't know if i had 
another memory consuming app running last time. even if i did, i did not 
get any OOM messages, but i could think of higher memory- / vm-pressure 
last time....
oh, and just in case i forgot last time, this is the machine:
http://nerdbynature.de/bits/sheep/2.4.24-benh/ver_linux
(maybe this is why syslog says: "
Feb 25 03:07:52 sheep kernel: This architecture does not implement 
dump_stack()"?)
Thank you,
Christian.
