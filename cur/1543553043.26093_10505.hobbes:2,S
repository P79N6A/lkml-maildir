   What exactly does "Explicit Congestion Notification" do?
It's a protocol extension by which routers can tell clients
about the onset of congestion before the routers stops to drop
that client's packets.
Unfortunately, a widely deployed firewall product made by Cisco and
used at most of the large web sites block packets that make use
of ECN.  They have fixed the bug, but I honestly don't expect these
sites to install the fix any time soon no matter how much the Cisco
folks tell me that such sites are "likely to".
