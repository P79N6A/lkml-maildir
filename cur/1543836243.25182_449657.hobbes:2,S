As far as I can tell from this conversation there are special "Xen" 
drivers that need this not the rest of the system.

What possible use could there be to someone else?
The "atomic" ops lock/unlock crap exists only for i386 as far as I can

never. The lock/unlock atomic ops are i386 specific material that 
better stay contained. Its arch specific and not generic.
