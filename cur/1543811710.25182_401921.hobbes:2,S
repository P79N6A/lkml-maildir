Well yes, it'll be something else - perhaps some TSC change or something. 
We'd need to know what architecture you're using...
Anwyay, these numbers aren't supposed to measure anything absolute like

increasing monotonically from zero, but we wouldn't bust a gut to achieve
that - it's just a debugging thing.
