It seems that everyone agrees now that moving PCI over to a new probing
model without individual driver support was a bad idea. So generic
multithreaded probing is dead.

Infrastructure for async probing might not be such a bad idea, though.
(Aren't there some huge PCI-based machines?) However, I don't really
care whether PCI or SCSI or $HUGE_BUS use it, but serial synchronous
probing on a bus looks like a killer on most large systems.
