That's BUG is my fault.  I put that in there so no one would tempted to call
msec_delay in the interrupt context.  As you've discovered, I missed one
case where msec_delay is called in interrupt context: tx_timeout.  Dangit!

Jeff, 10000 seems on the border of what's OK.  If it's acceptable, then
let's go for that.  Otherwise, we're going to have to chain several
mod_timer callbacks together to do a controller reset.
