And for a less-intrusive workaround in 2.6.18, see this commit

    [TCP]: Limit window scaling if window is clamped.
    This small change allows for easy per-route workarounds for broken hosts or
    middleboxes that are not compliant with TCP standards for window scaling.
    Rather than having to turn off window scaling globally. This patch allows
    reducing or disabling window scaling if window clamp is present.
    Example: Mark Lord reported a problem with 2.6.17 kernel being unable to
    access
