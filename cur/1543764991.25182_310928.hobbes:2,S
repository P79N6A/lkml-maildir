Just a side note that "tar xf" should know the file size before
unpacking it.  So it could set the reservation window size large enough
to fit the entire file before doing the file write through ioctl
command.

Yes indeed. However nothing is free and there are always trade-offs.:) 
By worse case you mean multiple writes trying to allocate blocks around
same area?
But I wonder if the latency saw by Lee belongs to this worst-case: the
latency comes mostly from loop calling find_next_zero_bit() in
bitmap_search_next_usable_block(). Even if we take out the whole
reservation, we still possibility run into this kind of latency: the
bitmap on disk and on journal are extremely inconsistent so we need to
keep searching them both until we find a free bit on both map.

Hmm...if we drop the lock entirely while scan the bitmap, assuming you
mean drop the read lock, then I am afraid we have to re-check the tree
(require a read or write lock ) to see if the new window space is still
there after the scan succeed. This is probably not very interesting for
the window rotating case.

Well, we cannot hold a reservation (which need to update the tree)
without a write lock. I guess if we want to improve the average case
latency by replacing the current spin_lock with the read lock for the
new window space searching, we don't have much choice here.

I wonder if this is feasible: Walk through the rb tree without a lock?
What if some node is being removed by another thread while we are
walking through the tree and trying to get the next node from it?
Thanks,
