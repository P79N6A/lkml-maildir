how can that be the second one? (I deduced it was the first one because
it cannot be the second one and the offset didn't look at the very end
of the function). This is the second one:
		if (!PageCompound(p))
			bad_page(__FUNCTION__, p);
but bad_page shows p->flags == 0x00080008 and 1<<PG_compound ==
0x80000.
So PG_compound is definitely set for "p" and it can't be the second one
triggering.
Can you double check? Maybe we should double check the asm. Something
sounds fundamentally wrong in the asm, sounds like a miscompilation,
which compiler are you using?
