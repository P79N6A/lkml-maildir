I'm experiencing the same problem with 2.2.12, but I'm using IrCOMM which
emulates serial port communication over IrDA (infrared). IrDA is however
using a CRC for each packet, so I don't think this has anything to do with
the serial driver. So it may instead be something above, and probably the
line-discipline (not that I have looked at the code there).
