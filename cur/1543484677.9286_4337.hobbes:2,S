Hi Chris,
> Are the files created by the split-includes script actually used yet?
Very much so, but not in the way you probably mean.  The C compiler
never sees them.  But 'make' uses them for dependencies.  Check out
Documentation/smart-config.txt and then look at some '.depend'
files and then come back and ask me questions if you like.
> Is there a reason for this?
Yes.  My original design was to migrate in the direction of including
individual files.  Then mkdep.c wouldn't need any special magic to
get fine-grained includes, and the kernel-building machinery would be
a little simpler.
There are two problems with this design.  The technical problem is
that config options often depend on other config options, so you
can't just #include <config/foo/bar.h> and have it work.
The social problem is like this.  Think of the linux kernel community
as a large cluster of hairy SMP systems.  Changing anything in the
way people write code requires flushing a huge number of L2 caches
inside people's heads.  This is difficult and expensive, so you have
to have a really compelling value proposition to make people want
to change anything in the kbuild process.
