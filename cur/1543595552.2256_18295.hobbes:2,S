I was thinking of doing a chrooted login for some ssh accounts.
The plan is this:
put stuff in
/home/u_dev
/home/u_etc
/home/u_bin
Then at login time mount them to
/home/user/dev
/home/user/etc
/home/user/bin
as readonly
chroot to /home/user
...
And then unmount them at logout time.
Does this seem like a bad idea?
(then please tell me why :))
One problem could be the _massive_ mounts, 3*online_users.
Are there any limits/drawbacks doing it like this?
Should i hardlink stuff instead? (worse maintainability).
Just a funny idea i have...
Hit me.
Magnus
