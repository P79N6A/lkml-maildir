It's my understanding that sys_reiser4() is basically defunct at this point.
It will probably be revived at some time in the future but we'd be best
off crossing that bridge when we arrive at it, and ignoring the syscall
part of the code at this time.
For review purposes it would be better if the syscall code and all the
namesys debug support code simply weren't present in the patch.  But one
can sympathise with the need to keep it there for the time being.  Please
just read around it.
