The upshot of stracing is in tthe Debian BTS <bugs.debian.org>
#319572.  Paul Rombouts, an author of pdnsd, reproduced the strace
crash and found the problem:

Which is true.  The sigwait man entry (Debian 'etch') says:
       The !sigwait! function never returns an error.
His patch (available in the BTS and included below) fixed the problem
of strace or S3 sleep crashing pdnsd.
Shouldn't sleeping and suspension be invisible to user-space processes
such as pdnsd?  Drivers and other kernel code need rewriting so that
devices and buses are not abandoned in a weird state, but going to
sleep should just pull the rug out from under the entire user space.
Then no user space process would need rewriting to survive a
sleep/wake, as long as the deep-freeze were cold enough.  Or is there
a subtlety with threads that I'm missing?
With APM, maybe such transparency was more possible since going to bed
was arranged by the firmware rather than by the OS, and the firmware
would pull out the rug from under the entire user and kernel space
(after maybe a bit of kernel prep).
