Hi, I have an Alpha XL 266, running a fairly current unstable release 
of debian. I recently tried to compile 2.6.5 stable. The machine has an 
ISA sound card, which has sticker on it which says it's a SoundBlaster 
AWE32 PnP, though the isapnp tools do not detect any boards at all. I 
enabled the PNP BIOS options and the damn thing errored out during 
compile.
all through the compile process I kept seeing shit like
LD      drivers/net/tulip/built-in.o
   LD      drivers/net/built-in.o

no idea what that's about, but I wouldn't have cared if some time later 
the thing hadn't errored out all together.

don't know wtf this is all about...but i'd sure like to use my sound 
card at some point...
