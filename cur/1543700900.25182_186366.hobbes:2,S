Should provide /usr/lib/libasound.so.2.0.0 (version may differ).

If you right click on xmms, and then select options->preferences, on the
first page to the bottom there should be output plugin.  If you cannot
select alsa, see if there is a xmms-alsa or libxmms-alsa plugin.  Sorry,
I do not know Debian that well.
Basically as sombody else noted - it might be with the OSS emulation,
so we want to use native alsa support with xmms ...
