Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems to me you're still mixing
the two problems together.
1a) the kernel exports a global page which has kernel data, such as the
    current time. Since the kernel exports it, it knows where it is
1b) user-space can look for the known page and read values from it, if
    it wants
2)  MAP_INHERIT can be used by user-space to implement
    machine-specific code.
Linus, another reason why I prefer MAP_INHERIT for code, is that it is
more expandable than having the kernel export a few "important" pieces
of code. It would allow dozens of liboptimise.so to come with a
distribution, and be mapped once (or a small number of times). It then
means it's easy to add new functions to this library. We'd start out
with the syscall interface, but then we'd have memset, memcpy, strcpy,
strncpy and so on.
Kernel exports data. User-space exports/shares/inherits code. Two
problems, two simple solutions. Why won't this work?
