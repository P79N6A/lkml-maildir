I'm slightly concerned by this.  There are a growing amount of drivers
in 2.5 which are being made to work with the existing power management
system.  This "new" system seems to have been hanging around for about
4 months now with no visible further work, presumably so that a paper
can be presented before its release.
My concern is that there has been:
- 4 months of non-exposure of this work
- 4 months of making the current system work
- and putting it in will require a fair number of drivers to be 
  re-worked.
Apart from driver re-work and that the core interfaces are supposed to
be stable, what are the technical arguments against merging it, say,
today?
