It's a historical anomaly which will hopefully die when we finally
manage to get sg and st converted to the generic request infrastructure.
Then scsi_request can be killed and this along with it.
What used to happen (as the comment implies) is that drivers would
allocate a single request and then reuse it for multiple independent
commands.  Since they weren't too picky about cleaning it up after each
use, we had to reset the DONTPREP flag to ensure each new invocation was
actually correctly prepared.
