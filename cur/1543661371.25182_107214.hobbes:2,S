oprofile saves the perfctr config when it starts in nmi_int.c, then
calls the set_nmi_pm_callback. Then the suspend/resume calls oprofile's,
and we assume we have unique access to controlling the generated NMIs
(ie it becomes oprofile's job to ensure no NMIs are generated by the
perfctrs whilst suspended).
It's pretty ugly, so a correct cleanup would be appreciated.
I suppose this is quite an unusual case for the PM model ?
