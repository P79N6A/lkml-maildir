I have a similar (but different) problem that I was hoping for help
with.
I can't build a kernel for my dual xeon e7500 board, with
hyperthreading enabled, that sees 4 logical processors. I can boot the
redhat 8 kernel and that sees 4, but my build of  2.4.20-ac2 gets me
'warning sibling not found' messages and just 2 cpus. 
It is built for P4 and has SMP on. Is there anything else I should
have to do? acpismp=force doesn't help (not that it should on 2.4.20
from what I read.)
