Right, because if we get this wrong, the kernel won't complain, but
we'll have a rare, impossible-to-diagnose potential data corrupter for
any applications which do recovery on reboot.  
If we're not going to change the code, then at the very least a huge
warning comment above clear_inode() is necessary to make it explicit
that you shouldn't ever pass in an inode with dirty buffers unless
nlink==0, and I'd rather see the BUG there instead.
