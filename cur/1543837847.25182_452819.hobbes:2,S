Ok, so that is not only me seeing things ;)

I think it is prudent to protect assess to these data structures. For
example, it could possibly race with setting power through sysfs
attribute. Now for this particular driver the race window is
non-existent for all practical purposes, but it looks like atyfb_base
might be needig it (of course currentimplementation not only have
up/down mixed but also has AB-BA deadlock).
How about we add backlight_set_power(&bd, power) to the backlight core
to take care of proper locking for drivers?
