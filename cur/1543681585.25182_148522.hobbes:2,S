It's getting an IRQ before the driver expects them,
I suspect.  I think the HCD glue needs a new entry,
forcing hardware reset before the rest of hcd init.
Easy/simple to do; and IMO reasonable too.
Of course, it's also strange that leaving ACPI on
causes problems at this level.  And that it only
happens for EHCI.
