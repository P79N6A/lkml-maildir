Eric,
   Sorry I was so vague.  I understand what you are saying, but I doubt
the disk speed of the server is the major bottleneck (for one thing I used
an Ultra 60 that was not serving anything except the private export used
for testing.)  The problems I have been encountering (for almost 2 years
now) can be summarized as follows (reproducible results).
These tests were done on a 100Mb switched network (Cisco 5000 switch)
with minimal network/processor load on the systems. 
S1 = Sun Ultra 60 Solaris 2.6 100Mb Ethernet
S2 = Sun Ultra 60 Solaris 2.6 100Mb Ethernet
S3 = Sun Ultra 1 140Mhz Solaris 2.6 10Mb Ethernet
L1 = Linux 450 Pentium II 100Mb Ethernet NFSV2
L2 = Linux 450 Pentium II 100Mb Ethernet NFSV3
...Speeds are reported Read/Write in megabytes per second...
                        CLIENTS
             S1           S2           S3           L1          L2      
S  
E   S1       **         8.0/7.5      0.8/0.7      7.0/0.5     0.5/4.5       
R   
V   L1     8.0/7.5      8.0/7.5      0.8/0.8        **        8.0/7.0

As you can see, performance is quite nice except for a few isolated cases.
You'll notice that a linux server is the way to go (except that I need
locking so I need knfsd and I'm still experimenting with it for
stability).  
I have a much more detailed summary I can send you but this is the basics
of it.
In short, my network can read/write very fast Solaris -> Solaris and
Linux -> Linux, but NFSV2 Linux writes slow to Solaris and NFSV3 Linux
reads slow from Solaris.
