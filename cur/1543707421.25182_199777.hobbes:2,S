just run modprobe?  Then you don't have to care.
IN_KERNEL=$(/sbin/modprobe -vn "${module_name}")
if [ -z "${IN_KERNEL}" ; then
	/bin/echo "Module: ${module_name} is in the kernel"
else
	/bin/echo "Module: ${module_name} would need to be loaded"
	/bin/echo "${IN_KERNEL}"
fi
Or similar.  Yeah it's a little ugly but only as prone to failure as
module-init-tools
