Reverse Mappings are cool, and one reason tehy're cool is, in theory, you can 
grab a page of physical memory away from something else.  In theory code 
could be written to ask the kernel "could you please swap this the heck out, 
pin the page in memory, and give it to me instead now?"  And it can refuse 
("it's already pinned by something else, maybe it's a kernel page, go away"), 
it can block a bit ("gotta flush it to disk, wait until DMA is done"), or it 
could immediatley comply ("it was a clean buffer, have it, keep it, stuff it 
and mount it on the wall for all I care...").
This means you can retroactively get contiguous areas of memory by shoving 
stuff aside.  If it's in use, it'll swap back in immediately.  (An obvious 
optimization occurs, but that's not necessary for minimal functionality.)
So the the whole problem of needing contiguous areas of memory could, in 
theory, be addressed using RMAP.
