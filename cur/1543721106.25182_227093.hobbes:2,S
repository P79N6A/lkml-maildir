S> Toshiba 1800-100 linux-2.6.x Driver for the SMC Infrared Communications
S> Controller does not work
It's a known problem. The reason is that Toshiba BIOS does not enable
the SMC irda controller. You can verify it useing lspnp -v (at least I
can on my 1800-314). If you enable the device by hand, it will work.
There is a Linux program for enabling the irda controller, look at
http://www.csai.unipa.it/peri/toshsat1800-irdasetup/
 .
The setup can problaby be made also from kernel but the main question is
how to autodetect the need for this setup.
