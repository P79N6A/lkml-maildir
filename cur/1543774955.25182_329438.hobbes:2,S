But processes (really, mapped text pages; really, read-only mapped pages
of all kinds) are loaded piecemeal in any case. Would you really like a
system where once something was faulted in, it could never leave? You'd
run out of memory *awfully* fast.
A system in which pages can be faulted in *and* out is consistent: one
in which they can only be faulted in is both inconsistent and very
deadlock-prone.
