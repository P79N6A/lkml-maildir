Thnank you very much for your patch. Couple of comments:

Do we really need a new bus type? Would not BUS_HOST suffice?

Input core already prints a line when a new input device is registered,
do we need another one?

It loks like call to input_free_device() is missing here. You would leak
memory if input_register_device would fail. 
I would also get rid of all likelys/unlikelys here - driver registration is
not a hot path...

Are we guaranteed that the dc_kbd_callback is not running in a separate
thread?
Please also consider implementing support for changing keyma. Since
the keymap is pretty full I think the best way is to copy the vanilla
keymap into a per-device memory and set up keymap, keycodesize and
keycodemax in input device structure.
Thank you.
