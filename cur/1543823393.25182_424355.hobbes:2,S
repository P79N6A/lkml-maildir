hmm. ok. Hannes' patch was the one in 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/3/6/47
 ?
I never found a kernel where I could apply that one and still compile
without errors :(
I am no C guru, so I had no success to fix this patch without even
knowing where to apply against... (and I don't know anything about
kernel programming or even ACHI low-level programming).
Is there a newer version available of that patch somewhere?
And - what SATA ACPI patches?
I have quite alot of patches related to sata and/or acpi (collected from
different mailing lists) here on hard disk but don't know which ones are
broken, outdated, etc. Most only apply on a 2.6.15 or 2.6.14-rc kernel...
If more recent patches are only available via git, I'd need some good
GIT tutorial first...
TIA, and sorry for stealing your time,
Michael
