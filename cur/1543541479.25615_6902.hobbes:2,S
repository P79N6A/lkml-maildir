On the PPC architecture (where the HFS CD-ROMs are most likely to be
used), mount -o loop doesn't work at all:
root[255]#mount -o loop /tmp/ramdisk.image /mnt/ram1
memlock: Invalid argument
Couldn't lock into memory, exiting.
Same thing for /dev/cdrom.
This is 2.4.0-test6, and it has been like this since early 2.3.99.
And don't ask for an strace on the above, because strace doen't work
either.
