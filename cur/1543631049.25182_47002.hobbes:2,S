Hi,
In this version numerous compilation problems were fixed:
 - when HIGHMEM_CONFIG was on and NTFS was compiled to the module, depmod
failed with undefined symbols.
 - when HIGHMEM_CONFIG was on and NTFS was compiled to the module on the
PPC arch, depmod failed with even more undefined symbols; I'd like any of
PPC gurus to verify these changes (one was backported from 2.4.19pre so I
assume it's correct, the other I'm not sure).
 - not used file was removed.
No more known bugs left. The next update is scheduled to sync with either
2.4.19[pre|rc|final] kernel or NTFS 2.0.8 which will be much work in both
cases.
Get it from:

Enjoy.
