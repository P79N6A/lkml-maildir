...and Ubuntu has vbetool solution which seems to work on 90% of all
notebooks, nice. Which big whitelist that basically says it all
works. Thanks for doing this work.

Perhaps we should force suspend/resume cycle at one of 10 boots :-).
Actually if you want to very quickly test if your changes did not
break swsusp, it should be enough to do 
swapoff -a; echo -n disk > /sys/power/state
. Your system will do half of system suspend, immediately followed by
resume.
