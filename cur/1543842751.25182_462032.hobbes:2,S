To expand on this a little, some of the capabilities you are looking to 
add are of very little if any use without being able to specify objects. 
For example, CAP_REG_OPEN is whether the process can open any file 
instead of specific ones. How many applications open no files whatsoever 
in practice? Even if there are some as soon as they change and need to 
open a file they'll need this capability and will be able to open any. 
CAP_REG_WRITE has the same problem. For a description of why 
CAP_REG_EXEC is meaningless see the digsig thread on the LSM list from 
earlier this year.
Further, adding more capabilities would likely make existing LSM's (like 
SELinux) deal with them. Since most LSM's already handle these 
permissions on a per-object basis these will be entirely redundant and 
more disruptive than useful.
Additionally since dropping capabilities is entirely discretionary and 
applications would be modified to actually drop the capabilities I can't 
ever see this being used in practice. It also embeds the policy into 
applications spread across the filesystem instead of having a 
centralized policy.  Since these are non-standard capabilities any 
application modified to take advantage of them could only do so on Linux.
