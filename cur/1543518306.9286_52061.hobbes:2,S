   Which may be true. But I'm still hoping that somebody will do the
   prelinked trick, and I'll bet that it will just blow the current
   setup out of the water.
It's ends up being expensive too, expensive to the point where
the gains from per-linking are cancelled out.
Ulrich did in fact investigate doing this, and people had full
intentions of doing it.
Let's say you have another shared library which overrides a weak
symbol in something you've "pre-linked", you have to check this.
