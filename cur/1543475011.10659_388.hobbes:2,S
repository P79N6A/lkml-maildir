Ah, a bandwidth waster!
It is much more disturbing that most sites don't carry bz2 files.
I've been forced to waste 25% more bandwidth and disk space because
of this problem.
Maybe this:
ftp.bus.kernel.org   This has bz2 files, as all mirrors should.
ftp.gus.kernel.org   This is for bandwidth wasters.
