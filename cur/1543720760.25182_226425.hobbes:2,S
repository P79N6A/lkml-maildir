Hmm.. That code has not been sparse-cleaned up, and as of today sparse 
gives 34 lines of warnings for that file. I assume the two you refer to is
	drivers/usb/core/devio.c:561:40: warning: cast removes address space of expression
	drivers/usb/core/devio.c:581:39: warning: cast removes address space of expression
and I assume those are the ones your thing finds too?
So I wanted to point out that sparse hasn't missed anything. It's just 
that the USB people haven't fixed the things it has found yet ;)

And part of the reason I much prefer the sparse approach of doing proper C 
types is that it's (a) the C way and (b) it documents what is up.
What we do NOT want to have is to continue with these "implied rules". 
That's what caused the bugs in the first place. I really want the user 
pointers to be _explicit_, because not only does that mean that a stupid 
tool can figure it out with purely "local" knowledge, but more 
importantly, it means that a _programmer_ can figure it out with purely 
local knowledge.
Now, I'm obviously biased, and hey, two tools are better than one. I just 
wanted to point out that your claim that "sparse missed bugs" just isn't 
true. What _is_ true is that there is quite a bit of non-fixed code out 
there.
