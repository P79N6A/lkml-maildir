Actually the reason for this is that ACPI specifies a virtual machine,
which is required for nearly everything ACPI related (except for processor
C-states and system S-states, I think). Andy Henroid is working on this
AFAIK, but basically he's alone doing that, as Max Berger is too busy with
his studies and I'm working on the policy management part (getting ACPI
functions accessible to the end user in the sense of "apm -s"). If you're
volunteering, however... :-)
