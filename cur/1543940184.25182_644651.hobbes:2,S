The near paperweight of Avermedia A828 Hybrid FM Volar nevertheless
works with their closed module[1] at least as a digital tuner and a
pretty crap FM tuner, despite the warning in syslog that it will no
longer work in short order.  Yes, I was suckered in by their claim
that "it works under Linux", wasn't I?
I would have thought it would be fairly easy to write open drivers for
it, given that it has pretty standard chips:
Cypress FX2, WM8739, Conexant CX2584x, Xceive XC3028 and Zarlink MT352
