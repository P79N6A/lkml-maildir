Hi hpa,
 First test, the AMD K6-2.
Before your patch..
	cpu family      : 5
	model           : 8
	stepping        : 12
After..
	cpu family      : 5
	model           : 8
	stepping        : 4
Line 1826 of setup.c
	c->x86_mask = tfms & 7;
Should be..
	c->x86_mask = tfms & 15;
I think?
Also, look at the feature flags:
before:
flags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr mce cx8 sep mtrr pge mmx 3dnow
after:
features        : fpu vme de pse tsc msr mce cx8 pge mmx syscall 3dnow
Note, I lost MTRR & sep. This may be related to the stepping bug
though. I'll recompile a kernel with the &15 fix, and see if that cures
all.
btw, whilst all this is getting a shakedown, how about renaming
that 'x86_mask' field to the more obvious 'x86_stepping' ?
c->x86 would make more sense as c->x86_family too thinking about it.
regards,
Davej.
