Thanks, 2ea5814472c3c910aed5c5b60f1f3b1000e353f1 builds again for MIPS.
If you deciede to put the patch back in after 2.6.19 I'm considering to
replace the local_irq_{save,restore} calls in the various atomic operations
in <asm/{atomic,bitops,system}.h with their raw_* equivalents.
What I dislike about Alexey's patch is that is finally tries to cast
unsigned long as the data type for the flags into stone.  The natural
data type to use on MIPS and several other architectures is a 32-bit
integer - or just a single bit on a stingy day ;-).  Time for flags_t
maybe?
