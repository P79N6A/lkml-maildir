If it is a Kconfig issue, then we don't really need all the function
pointers and ops things.  Just pick which integrity infrastructure you
want at compile time.  You also wouldn't need that integrity_ops
function at all.

So, you'll go investigate this, fix it up in a future patch and if you
decide it needs to be kept, it will be commented, right?

synchronize_rcu() is an "expensive" operation in wall clock time.  It
won't cost you a lot of CPU or anything, but it could cause this code to
block for a bit of time.
What you've said there is:
1. delete the template from the list
2. sleep until no one can possibly see the template any more
3. delete template
Call RCU would, instead, queue the template (and the kref_put()) in a
list.  That list gets called in a batched manner once a grace period has
elapsed.  The batching speeds things up, and it also doesn't block in
the caller.
I do see some other use like this in the kernel, but I have a suspicion
that there's a better way to do it.  Could you have Paul McKenney take a
quick look?  Dipankar or Josh Triplett seem to also love to look at
RCU. :)
