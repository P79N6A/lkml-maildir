Hello,
First, I'm assuming that if I want my task to have the HIGHEST priority 
in the system (i.e. preempt any other task whenever it is put into the 
ready queue (assuming I have preemption turned on/configured)), I use 
sched_setscheduler (...) and use the sched_priority in sched_param for 
MAX_RT_PRIO -1. Is this correct?
Second, assuming that MAX_RT_PRIO-1 is the highest, would it be bad on 
an SMP/Hyperthreading system (that's using the migration thread 
balancing in 2.6.20.7) to set a task's priority to MAX_RT_PRIO -1 given 
the fact that the migration threads are already set to MAX_RT_PRIO -1? 
Should I be setting my task's prio to MAX_RT_PRIO-2 to not interfere 
with the load balancing?
Thanks,
Chris
