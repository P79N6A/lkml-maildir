Couldn't load JBuilder (Out of memomy).
echo "1" >/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory => solved my 1st problem. I can
build and run my project from inside JBuilder. But OOM killer still doesn't
work (2nd). Anyway, thank you. I will play with your Magic numbers later,
Wizard ;). There are still alot of things to play with.
