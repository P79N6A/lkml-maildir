Just make a new function, just as you want, then call it from some
test-code and compare its speed against the present one. Also make sure
it works.
I think you will find that most everything you do becomes I/O bound
with fast CPUs. Once you have CPUs that run N times faster than memory
can be accessed, you can make code that is N times slower without
any measurable difference in performance.
This makes it very difficult to prove that there is any improvement
in performance. As faster CPUs become commonplace, you can rewrite
everything in FORTRAN(*) and see no difference in performance. This
will make the FORTRAN(*) gurus happy as they explain that this is the
only language that should ever be used.
(*) Substitute the language-of-the-day.
