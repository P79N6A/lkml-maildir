Relatively minor add-on (not necessarily tied to it or required to be
taken or a fix for any bug). Since cond_resched() is using
PREEMPT_ACTIVE now, it may be useful to update the open-coded instance
of cond_resched() to use the generic call. Also, it should probably be
__sched so the caller shows up in wchan.
