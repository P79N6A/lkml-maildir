Ok, it's two weeks since 2.6.15, and the merge window is closed.
In fact, it already closed yesterday when I was planning on doing the 
release, but we had people over for dinner, and things devolved. "The 
best-laid plans of mice and kernel-developers.."
Anyway, it's out there now. The ShortLog is pretty readable - if you are 
into that kind of stuff - but as usual for an -rc1 release (which has all 
the frantic merging going on), it's actually too big to post on the kernel 
list due to the size limits. It's weighs in at 4000+ lines and 169kB.
Anyway, if you're a git user, here's what generated the shortlog:
	git-rev-list --no-merges --pretty=short v2.6.15..v2.6.16-rc1 | 
		git-shortlog > ../ShortLog
and you can find the _full_ log on kernel.org as ChangeLog-2.6.16-rc1 if 
you want to.
The diffstat is also too big to post. It's also all over the map: there's 
actually a fair number of cleanups in there that have affected a lot of 
files, as did the new mutexes, for example. 
There's also updates for various architectures: powerpc continues the long 
slog to a merged tree - now ppc32 is mostly done too, but there's updates 
to arm, x86[-64], m68k, frv, ia64, pa-risc, m32r, s390, etc..
And usb, i2c, pcmcia, fbdev, v4l, drm, scsi, alsa, input layer, network 
drivers, infiniband.. The tty layer got some clean-ups too (wonder of 
wonders).
OCFS2 was merged, fuse updates, fat fixes, and p9fs, XFS and NFS updates.
And largish networking updates: there's a "common netfilter" setup now, 
which you'll notice when you do "make config" or equivalent, since a lot 
of the netfilter rules now work on ipv4 and/or ipv6 rather than having 
separate (and duplicate) versions for each.
