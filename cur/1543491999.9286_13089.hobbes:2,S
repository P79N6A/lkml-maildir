Anyhow, the most recent lsm I have:

Title:          sysklogd
Version:        1.3
Entered-date:   960227
Description:    The sysklogd package implements two system log
                daemons.  The syslogd daemon is the general system
                logging daemon which is responsible for handling
                requests for syslog services.  This version of
                syslogd is similar to the standard Berkeley product
                but with a number of compatible extensions.  The
                klogd daemon runs either standalone or as a client of
                syslogd.  Klogd 'listens' to kernel log messages,
                prioritizes them and routes them to either output
                files or to syslogd.  This version of klogd will
                optionally translate kernel addresses to their
                symbolic equivalents if provided with a system map.
