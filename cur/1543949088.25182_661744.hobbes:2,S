I hope this won't dump me into the flamers filter....but here goes:
If the intent of the GPLONLY export is really to keep the symbol from 
being used by non-GPL code then I agree that ndiswrapper shouldn't be 
able to use them.
However, you yourself wrote something stating otherwise: 
(
http://groups.google.ca/group/linux.kernel/msg/0066655bb1be1e4c
):
'I think we _can_ do things where we give clear hints to people that "we
think this is such an internal Linux thing that you simply cannot use 
this without being considered a derived work".....So I personally don't 
see EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() to be a "technical measure", I see it as being 
"documentation".'
Under that interpretation, ndiswrapper should be able to make use of 
GPLONLY symbols because the binary blobs are clearly not derivative works.
