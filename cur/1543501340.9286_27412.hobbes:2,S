We already have per-inode page lists threading the page cache: can't we
use that?

Exactly: that's the point.  For networked fses, the page cache is the
only thing that matters: the buffer cache is *designed* to be tightly
integrated with the block device layers.

Sure, that makes a great deal of sense.

Stick with the page cache for networked filesystems.
