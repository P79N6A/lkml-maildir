Yep, do_gettimeofday is called from generic code in sys_gettimeofday()
(kernel/time.c). It returns the same value userspace code would see
calling gettimeofday().

Ah! Ok, I missed the conversion in hangcheck_init. Even so, the default
initializer is misleading. Yea, that's it... :)

Completely understandable. do_gettimeofday will give you just that (w/o
the conversion muck w/ HZ and loops_per_jiffy).
