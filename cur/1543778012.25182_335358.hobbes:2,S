The difference in the X logs is that the working one does not have the:
(II) RADEON(0): [drm] created "radeon" driver at busid "pci:0000:01:00.0"
(II) RADEON(0): [drm] added 8192 byte SAREA at 0xffffc20000411000
(II) RADEON(0): [drm] drmMap failed
message.  When it works it has has:
(II) RADEON(0): [drm] created "radeon" driver at busid "pci:0000:01:00.0"
(II) RADEON(0): [drm] added 8192 byte SAREA at 0x10001000
(II) RADEON(0): [drm] mapped SAREA 0x10001000 to 0x2aaab2e67000
(II) RADEON(0): [drm] framebuffer handle = 0xd0000000
(II) RADEON(0): [drm] added 1 reserved context for kernel
(II) RADEON(0): [agp] Mode 0x1f004209 [AGP 0x10de/0x00e1; Card 0x1002/0x5961]
(II) RADEON(0): [agp] 8192 kB allocated with handle 0x00000001
(II) RADEON(0): [agp] ring handle = 0xe0000000

Both .configs are fine.  Kernels have agp compiled in with DRM modular.
CONFIG_GART_IOMMU=y
CONFIG_AGP=y
CONFIG_AGP_AMD64=y
# CONFIG_AGP_INTEL is not set
CONFIG_DRM=y
CONFIG_DRM_TDFX=m
CONFIG_DRM_R128=m
CONFIG_DRM_RADEON=m
Hope this helps (Its an AMD64 Kernel),
Ed
