   Note that this part of the status page really is worth some attention.
   Alan doesn't have the time to maintain 2.4.x issues. Which means that
   right nobody is really doing it. I have a kind of general "map" in my
   head, but that isn't nearly good enough..
   Would somebody be interested in taking this over?
I'm willing to take this over.  
Note that unless Alan can give me his secret of making clones of
himself, I can't necessarily read every single message on linux-kernel;
so folks will need to send me mail explicitly if they want to make sure
I'm going to read it.  I'll try to skim postings on linux-kernel, but
like most kernel developers, that isn't necessarily the most reliable
way of making sure I'll read something.
