In my older days of programmin 82489DX chipsets (which the AMD APIC 
versions resemble
the 82489DX more closely than intel's newer incarnations), you had to 
EOI the apic early if you
wanted to migrate interrupt assignments. I had to do the following steps 
to move an IRQ:
1. Mask the LOCAL APIC
2, EOI the interrupt
3. Leave the interrupt entry masked until the ISR completed.
4. Reprogram the interrupt.
5. Unmask as the ISR exits
In other words, EOI early in all cases to clear the local and IOAPIC state.
