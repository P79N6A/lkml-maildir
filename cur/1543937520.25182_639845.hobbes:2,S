No he isn't and that's why I'm rude -- everything needs to be repeated over 
and over and over again. Read the thread(s). You didn't limit your reply to 
chipset logic and Alan even already submitted patches to isolate the delay 
for the chipset logic (PIC and PIT that is) where the expectation is that a 
simple udelay() will suffice.
We've already talked about ISA bus speed, and how it's not in a sane sense 
portably determinable, we've already talked about kernel parameters, about 
udelay and it's usefulness in early boot, about how your rude "Junk I/O" is 
exactly what is needed for some ISA devices and so on...
In fact, we're blue in the face from talking about it. So say something 
useful or go away.
