Thanks. Does it make any difference if you enable
CONFIG_DEBUG_MEMLEAK_TASK_STACKS? Also, if you save the memleak file
periodically, do any of the context_struct_to_string reports disappear
(I can investigate this if you upload a few ml60.txt, mk61.txt etc.)?

This looks like a false positive as the conntrack pointer is lost in
init_conntrack and only a pointer conntrack->tuplehash[...].list is
stored. This cannot be aliased via container_of because
tuplehash_to_ctrack doesn't pass a constant argument to it and cannot
be determined at compile time. Try the attached patch.
Note that you can get some false positives that might disappear after
a while. This is because of the stacks scanning and also pointers
stored in CPU registers, especially on SMP systems.
Thanks.
