BTW, it looks like powerpc runs out of MMU contexts if
there are more than 32768 processes. Badness happens.

Never minding the bare minimum, I think the user-visible
offset should be the PID plus some constant for all PIDs.
(sadly, the constant can't be 0 because of ".." and init)

You mean /proc/42 could be non-process data?
That will surely break lots and lots of things.
In general, process namespaces are useful for:
1. silly marketing (see Sun and FreeBSD)
2. the very obscure case of "root" account providers
   who are too clueless to use SE Linux or Xen
I don't think either case justifies the complexity.
I am not looking forward to the demands that I
support this mess in procps. I suspect I am not
alone; soon people will be asking for support in
pstools, gdb, fuser, killall... until every app which
interacts with other processes will need hacks.
If the cost were only an #ifdef in the kernel, there
would be no problem. Unfortunately, this is quite
a hack in the kernel and it has far-reaching
consequenses in user space.
