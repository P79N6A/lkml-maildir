Speaking in broad terms, it's normal to see new device connection and
configuration messages like the ones above when a USB device is plugged in
to your computer.  What's not normal is to see disconnects.  So you should
be concentrating on what happens just before the log entries you posted --
why is the card reader disconnecting?  Turning on CONFIG_USB_DEBUG may 
provide more help.
