Hi, 
I've been benchmarking file copy operations between 2.5.65-mm1 
and 2.4.20-2.51 since I have noticed that transferring files from my 
2.4.20 machine to 2.5.65-mm1 gives an steady 10MBps throughput 
but doing the opposite (from 2.5.65-mm1 to 2.4.20) gives me a 
mere 3MBps throughput. 
After transferring a 256MB file using NFS and SCP, I have noticed 
several "eth0: Transmit error, Tx status register 90.". I have attached 
dmesg output, ioports, iomem, lsmod and lspci. 
Any ideas on what's happing here? Why network transfers do 
complete in less time when sending data from 2.40.20  to 
2.5.65-mm1 kernel, but take more than twice when doing the 
opposite? 
Thanks! 
   Felipe
