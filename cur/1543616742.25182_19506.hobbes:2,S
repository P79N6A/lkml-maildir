I had the same problem with ext3fs
The problem was when trying to READ from the partition and not when trying to write. That was interesting.
I copied a lot of files to my ext3 partition (5 gig) and when I tried to copy it back to the other partition(vfat) there were some input-output errors and i got all the data lost, I had to format the ext3 partition and install linux again.
So, the problem does not seem to be hardware problem.
I am traveling now, not in my house, so I can't test it one more time, and when I'll be back probably there will be a fixed kernel, but if not, I'll test it again anyway.
