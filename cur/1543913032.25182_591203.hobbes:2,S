We're talking about accessing the extended part of config spaces. I'm not 
aware of any case where that is required to boot a system.

I don't think it's a big issue if IBS doesn't work on a few buggy BIOS
(which should hopefully become fewer anyways because Vista is out
which actually uses MCFG)

It should boot sure, but exotic stuff not working is not a major issue
