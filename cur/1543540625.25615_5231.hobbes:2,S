   Not an issue for me, I just need to tell a PCI device to DMA
   to/from a memory resource of itself.
Strangely enough this is exactly what the drivers/scsi/ncr53c8xx.c
driver (which I used as an example in a previous email) does too, so
you can just steal the arch ifdef mania from there to get the
necessary functionality.
