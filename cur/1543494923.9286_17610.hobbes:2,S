Sorry for the delay. I needed to read for Friday's exam.
On to the patch.
I hand-applied most parts of it, didn't touch ioapic-level functions or
visws file, and also didn't apply the part about locking against when
called from the interrupt handler. I had to add disable_irq_nosync to
the list of exported functions in i386_ksyms.c, since my 3c509 only
works as a modules. After that, it worked very well. No problems
flood pinging (previously it would have locked within five seconds).
Functionality-wise the patch works miracles. Have you considered Linus'
suggestion about implementing IRQ_BUSY flag? Would that be a cleaner
approach?
