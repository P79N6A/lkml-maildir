As discussed on linux1394-devel, it may be possible to do a thin video1394 
compatibility driver for this one, but since the biggest user of this 
interface is libdc1394, it is probably better to just write a new iso 
streaming backend for this library. libdc1394 already supports different 
streaming backends.  For non-libdc1394 users of video1394, the interface I'm 
providing is very close to the video1394 ioctl interface, so porting should be 
easy enough.

My POV here *is* about deployment and support, but from the kernel side of 
things.  If you commit yourself to long time support for the firewire stack, 
would you prefer 4 slightly different streaming drivers with different user 
space interfaces, or just one userspace driver with one userspace interface, 
that enables the 4 different types of streaming to be done in userspace?  The 
design of the streaming interfaces have been focused on enabling all these 
ad-hoc, in-kernel drivers to move to userspace, to make it feasible to 
actually support the stack.
