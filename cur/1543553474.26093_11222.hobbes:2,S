Alan,
The 2.2.18pre-19 build does not reproduce this problem with NFS RPC
timeouts, and Andre has merged his patches for our next release, and I
am unable to reproduce it.  In fact, it's running great.   I did have
NDS eDirectory installed on this box when I saw the problem, and without
this software loaded, it seems to be gone.  I think it may be related to
eDirectory in some way (top is reporting some busy process in
eDirectory).  I held off posting the release to reverify the 2.2.18pre18
problems, and to get Andre's patches into the release.   We will go out
with 2.2.18pre-19 at this point.   
Also, I am seeing a lockup on 2.4.0-10 with uniprocessor PPro systems
with SMP enabled, but it runs great on a 4xPPro system with SMP (???). 
I rebuilt with SMP=N and it also ran great.  One for H. Peter Anvin I
think ....
:-)
Jeff
