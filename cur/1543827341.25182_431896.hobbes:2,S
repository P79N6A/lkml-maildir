All,
My USB hub isn't recognised with the latest -mm series, whereas with 
2.6.16 vanilla it is picked up & used immediately.
The error I get in dmesg is;
hub 4-0:1.0: USB hub found
hub 4-0:1.0: 2 ports detected
usb 1-4: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 3
ehci_hcd 0000:00:10.3: Unlink after no-IRQ?  Controller is probably 
using the wrong IRQ.
usb 1-4: device not accepting address 3, error -110
usb 1-4: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 4
usb 1-4: device not accepting address 4, error -110
usb 1-4: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 5
usb 1-4: device not accepting address 5, error -110
usb 1-4: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 6
usb 1-4: device not accepting address 6, error -110
usb 2-2: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 2
Which seems to be related to my Belkin hub. The full USB related dmesg 
information can be found below, I'm happy to provide further debugging 
information as required :)
