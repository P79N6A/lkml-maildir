I've just noticed what might be a bug in the original code.  Shouldn't 
the following:
        if ((current->euid != p->euid) && (current->euid != p->uid) &&
                !capable(CAP_SYS_NICE))
be:
        if ((current->uid != p->uid) && (current->euid != p->uid) &&
                !capable(CAP_SYS_NICE))
I.e. if the real or effective uid of the task doing the setting is not 
the same as the uid of the target task it is not allowed to change the 
target task's policy unless it is specially privileged.
