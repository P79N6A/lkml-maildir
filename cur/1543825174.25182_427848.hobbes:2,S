There are only a few semantics that make sense: fixed 8, 16, 32, or 64
bits, plus "optimal"; the latter to be used for anything that doesn't
require a specific transfer size.  Logically, an unqualified
"memcpy_to/fromio" should be the optimal size (as few transfers as
possible) -- we have a qualified "memcpy_to/fromio32" already, and 8-
and 16-bit variants could/should be added.
However, having the unqualified version do byte transfers seems like a
really bad idea.
