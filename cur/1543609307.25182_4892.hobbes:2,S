I'm currently running Linux 2.4.15-pre2 and have no troubles with ssh. I can
safely login onto other hosts, or issuing commands like
	ssh -l someuser@somehost mutt
or copy files
	scp somefile someuser@somehost:
I'm not using OpenSSH 3.0 yet (2.9p2). I'm not running any firewall or
transparent proxying.
PS My apologies that this reply isn't like it should be (no Message-ID to
   what it is replying) but I've removed the mail before I could reply...
