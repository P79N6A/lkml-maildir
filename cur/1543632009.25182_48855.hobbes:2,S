Doing INIT_LIST_HEAD() on them would be certainly cleaner...

Hey, speeding this up is not a top priority. But.. if we can make it
simpler as well ... ;-).
#ifdef CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND
int is_head_of_free_region(struct page *page)
{
        zone_t *zone = page_zone(page);
        unsigned long flags;
        int order;
        list_t *curr;
        /*
         * Should not matter as we need quiescent system for
         * suspend anyway, but...
         */
        spin_lock_irqsave(&zone->lock, flags);
        for (order = MAX_ORDER - 1; order >= 0; --order)
                list_for_each(curr, &zone->free_area[order].free_list){
                        if (!curr)
                                break;
                        if (page == list_entry(curr, struct page,list)) {
                                spin_unlock_irqrestore(&zone->lock,flags);
                                return 1 << order;
                        }

Does that look okay to you?
