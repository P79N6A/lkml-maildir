	PCI ID matching relies on the zeros being filled in for
an empty value in the case of class_mask.  depmod deliberately
includes a format comment at the start of modules.pcimap so that the
structure can be changed in the future.
	However, thanks for your feedback.  I will take it into
consideration.
