Hi,
Just a little question. In previous kernels and shm patches the /dev/shm
filesytem was invisible under a 'mount' query (just managed like procfs
or devpts). Now it appears listed under a mount command. Is it normal ?
Does mount show it coz it is no more 'special' or hidden in any way ?
(now i'm running 2.4.1-ac3)
