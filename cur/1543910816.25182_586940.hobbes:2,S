That _is_ the *config description for the new (CONFIG_ATA_PIIX) driver (in 
2.6.22.x).

Because he described the problem that if he got his (SATA) disk supported he 
lost his (PATA) DVD drive. Although I'm as said not completely sure it would 
actually work, I suggested compiling in both ATA_PIIX (yes, and sd) for his 
drive and the IDE PIIX/ICH driver and ide-cd for his DVD, where if it works 
at all, passing the above option may or may not be useful.
But his report, although expansive, was a little unclear. Let's wait for 
what happens with only ATA_PIIIX.
Rene.
