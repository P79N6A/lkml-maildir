Hey, nice.
I've got a nearly 100% reproducability of the problem here (FAM +
nautilus + hal.hotplug or something like that, I'm always getting this
Oops in nautilus trying to do something with its trash folder when I'm
mounting a remote volume). I'll try this patch and tell you if it's
working (for me).
