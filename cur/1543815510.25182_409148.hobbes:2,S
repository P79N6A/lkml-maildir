This is great news. Is there any relationship between the development of
this driver and the one maintained by Marvell that's available from
their web site ? Their latest version (3.6.1) is released under the GPL,
and is a very solid driver based our experience with it over the past
few years, though it's targeted at older versions of the linux kernel
and needs some porting to 2.6.16 (and contains redundant stuff like its
own scsi-ata layer).
