Overhead of what?  Does this include merging the data and getting it to
disk?
Am I even asking the right question here - is it true that this data,
when collected for accounting purposes, needs to go to disk, and that
summarizing and analyzing the data is done 'off-line', perhaps hours
later?  That's the way it was 25 years ago ... but perhaps the basic
data flow appropriate for accounting has changed since then.
And if the data flow has changed, then how to you account for the fact
that the rest of the accounting data, under the CONFIG_BSD_PROCESS_ACCT
option, is still collected the 'old fashioned way' (direct kernel write
to disk)?
