Hi,
your oops is the first crash reported against generic_make_request in
2.6.18 (in fact, in the last year pretty much) so it's not a very
common pattern. However, you're running a 2.6.18 kernel, which is
really really old (and has many known security issues fixed since);
it's probably a good idea to do a yum upgrade to get a more current
kernel; fc6 ships something like a 2.6.22 or 2.6.23 nowadays as
update...
Greetings,
