Subject: Re: [PATCH] integrate driverfs and devfs (2.5.28)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Forgot to mention:
-    the floppy driver was converted as an example
-    adds a new file "dev" to each driverfs entry
-    output is in the following format
        MAJOR,MINOR PATH
-    one line per each devfs entry during output
-    to test try: #cat (driverfs)/root/sys/03?0/dev
        assuming you have a floppy drive
-    Applies cleanly to 2.5.29 as well
-    If there's a demand for it I'll add the ability to unregister
        individual devfs entries from driverfs
Cheers,
