Because the kernel itself is on a small flash partition (RedBoot 
executes the kernel from /dev/mtd1), which is only 1572864 bytes big.
So it leaves me only about 300 kB left (kernel is about 1.2 MB) for all 
tools needed to script such a logic, and it includes all the tools I 
would need.
Another obstacle would be to place the initramfs image on the same 
partition as the kernel (normally, I dd kernel to /dev/mtd1).
Or perhaps, I don't understand initramfs correctly.
