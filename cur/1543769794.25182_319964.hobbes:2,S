In which case we have a problem:
http://www.kernel.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=12f49643bc44c428919b210148a930496827dd26
Therefore, I put forward that this thing which appears to be called
"author" does not reflect authorship, but who submitted it.
Alternatively, if you are right, we must not wrongfully claim people
"author" code in this way, and the above log entry needs fixing.
Since that's not possible, we must refuse patches from people who
aren't themselves the authors of the submitted code.  But how do we
positively know that in every case?
That's another very interesting problem you've just brought up with
public project systems.  And of course now that it's been identified
it needs addressing.  8(
