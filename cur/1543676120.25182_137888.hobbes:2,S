As I tried to point out, the current patch on the table doesn't actually
"fix" anything, in that it can break things even _worse_ than the current
situation.
A much better fix might well be to actually not allow over-long tty writes
at all, and thus avoid the "block out" thing at the source of the problem,
instead of trying to make programs who play nice be the ones that suffer.
If somebody does a 1MB write to a tty, do we actually have any reason to 
try to make it so damn atomic and not return early?
