Hai all ..,
 Regarding to the kernel panic on linux-2.4.22,pls enable the file 
system support of MINIX in the make menuconfig and also enable the 
ROM DISK support in the menuconfig.
The error is occuring because of the inavailability of support to 
the MINIX support ,in my view.
In the menuconfig use filesystem support to select or in config 
file check for this.
