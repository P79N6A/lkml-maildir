To be honest, when I saw your mail about that change, I was happy
to down tools as the problem was clearly fixed.  At that point I
already had suspicions that the optimisations in this area may
have issues.
But after a few more days, all the IBM blade folks were still
saying they were having problems - and then Mike W gave me a
kick ;*P
I think the issue with the code up 'till now is that when HW
autoneg fails, the driver just hangs about waiting for the
hardware to do something - in my previous testing here, the
switch would eventually recover (my only way of breaking the
switch was to drop it to the monitor prompt or reload it),
and at that point tg3 picks up the link status change and
everything's rosy.

Yes, I really ought to be running a current box, but for various
reasons I've been quite short of hardware for the past couple of
months.  I now have a lab again, but it's not yet turned on, so
I'm still scrounging hardware from people...
Feeble excuses... but they're the only ones I have :-/
