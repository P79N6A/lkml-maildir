I apologize for my ignorance. This is what I did after saving your 
patches as firewire1 and firewire2 text files:
root@localhost dave # cd /usr/src/linux
root@localhost linux # ls /home/dave/patches
firewire1  firewire2
root@localhost linux # cp /home/dave/patches/* .
root@localhost linux # cat firewire1 | patch -p1
patching file drivers/ieee1394/ieee1394_core.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 608 (offset -1 lines).
root@localhost linux # cat firewire2 | patch -p1
missing header for unified diff at line 5 of patch
can't find file to patch at input line 5
Perhaps you used the wrong -p or --strip option?
The text leading up to this was:
--------------------------
|Index: ieee1394_core.c
|===================================================================
|--- ieee1394_core.c    (revision 1013)
|+++ ieee1394_core.c    (working copy)
--------------------------
File to patch:
root@localhost linux #
Also, how do I compiled the modules with debug enabled? Thanks.
