I'm amazed hardware manufacturers would dare to do such a thing - I
guess I'm naive.

I tried this and found that /proc/ide/hda/settings was lying in that
it always reports write caching as disabled.  Once disabled with
hdparm the disks didn't re-enable write caching on their own.
These are new test results run on a pair of 5k rpm disks with write
caching disabled (average of three runs):

As you can see the persistent snapshots are taking a significant
performance hit compared to the non-persistent ones due to the
overhead of ensuring all the data on the disk is consistent.
I would expect the EVMS async snapshots to perform similarly to
device-mappers non-persistent snapshots since they are not ensuring
any form of consistency.  Effectively they are not writing any
exception metadata to the disk until a controlled shutdown occurs.
