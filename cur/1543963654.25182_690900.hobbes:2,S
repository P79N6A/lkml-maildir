This is the same filehandle type XFS uses for 64bit inode filesystems
where the parent is not encoded.  I'll post a patch soon to move that
64bit inode handling to common code.  I don't think it's a good idea
to delay your patch until that happens, but can you chose the fid
types to be the same as XFS does currently so that a conversion is
easily possible.  The fh_type should be 0x81 (fh type 1 order by 0x80
to imply it's 64bit inodes)
In case you want to look at that patch I'v uploaded the current
version at

Only finding in-memory inodes for nfs export is quite dangerous.  I
think it would be a much better idea to support whatever upcalls are
needed to find the object if it's not in memory.  Without that the nfs
exporting support is hardly useable.
