What I'd suggest you do is to look at enabling the feature for, say,
IS_CYCLONE and IS_TORNADO NICs.  Do that as a separate -mm patch, make sure
that an explicit `use_mmio=0' will still turn it off.
So in the style of that driver, something like:
static int use_mmio[MAX_UNITS] = { [ 0 .. MAX_UNITS-1 ] = -1, };
Then:
	if (module parm given)
		use_mmio[unit] = 1 or 0
	...
	/* Determine the default if the user didn't override us */
	if (use_mmio[unit] == -1 && (IS_CYCLONE || IS_TORNADO))
		use_mmio[unit] = 1;
	priv->use_mmio = use_mmio[unit];	(maybe)
	....
	if (priv->use_mmio == 1)
		do mmio stuff
There's a bit to be done here, so I'll drop your initial set of patches.
btw, Donald Becker's 3c59x.c has done mmio for ages.  Suggest you take a
look in there.
