Hello everyone,
My machine has ASUS CUV4X-E mainboard with Award BIOS.
Using poweroff command, I can power off my machine
with kernel 2.2.x.
But with kernel 2.4.x, this machine doesn't change
to soft-off(S5) state after poweroff command enters.
The last message is "Could not enter S5".
However, old via-chipset mainboard machine has
no problem to poweroff with kernel 2.4.x.
I found 2.3.x VIA chipset patch for ACPI.
Is there 2.4.x VIA chipser pach for ACPI?
