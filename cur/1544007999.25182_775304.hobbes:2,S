From: Rusty Russell <>
Subject: [PATCH 4/6] cpumask: switch over to cpu_online/possible/active/present_mask: core
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/1/46

Impact: cleanup
This implements the obsolescent cpu_online_map in terms of
cpu_online_mask, rather than the other way around.  Same for the other
maps.
The documentation comments are also updated to refer to _mask rather
than _map.

  * Subtleties:

  *    assumption that their single CPU is online.  The UP
- *    cpu_{online,possible,present}_maps are placebos.  Changing them
+ *    cpu_{online,possible,present}_masks are placebos.  Changing them
  *    will have no useful affect on the following num_*_cpus()
  *    and cpu_*() macros in the UP case.  This ugliness is a UP
  *    optimization - don't waste any instructions or memory references
  *    asking if you're online or how many CPUs there are if there is
  *    only one CPU.
- * 2) Most SMP arch's #define some of these maps to be some
- *    other map specific to that arch.  Therefore, the following
- *    must be #define macros, not inlines.  To see why, examine
- *    the assembly code produced by the following.  Note that
- *    set1() writes phys_x_map, but set2() writes x_map:
- *        int x_map, phys_x_map;
- *        #define set1(a) x_map = a
- *        inline void set2(int a) { x_map = a; }
- *        #define x_map phys_x_map
- *        main(){ set1(3); set2(5); }
