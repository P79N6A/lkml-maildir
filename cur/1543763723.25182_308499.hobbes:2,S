Yes - agreed.  I should push in the direction of improving the
SN2 sched domain hierarchy.
Would be a good idea to rename 'cpu_distance()' to something more
specific, like 'cpu_dist_ndx()', and reserve the generic name
'cpu_distance()' for later use to return a scaled integer distance,
rather like 'node_distance()' does now.  For example, 'cpu_distance()'
might, someday, return integer values such as:
	40  217  252  253
as are displayed (in tenths) in the debug line:
---------------------
cacheflush times [4]: 4.0 (4080540) 21.7 (21781380) 25.2 (25259428) 25.3 (25372682)
---------------------
(that is, the integer (long)cost / 100000 - one less zero).
I don't know that we have any use, yet, for this 'cpu_distance()' as a
scaled integer value.  But I'd be more comfortable reserving that name
for that purpose.
