Hello,
the 0.13 sis5513.c version had bad detection data. Latest patch corrects
this (at least on my SiS735 based system).
I've not yet get ridden of the SiSHostChipInfo[] dependancy, this will
be v0.14 material.
If you have a SiS chipset that is not from the ATA66 generation, you
probably have a need for this version, please test.

or (mirror, learned its need the hard way)

This is against stock 2.4.17, must apply cleanly to 2.4.18preX/rc1 and
should apply to several earlier 2.4.x.

Happy (U)DMA'ing.
