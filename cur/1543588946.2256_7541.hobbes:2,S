Agreed.  
But one thing XML provides (potentially) is a DTD that defines meanings and formats.  
IMHO the kernel needs something like this for /proc (though not in DTD format!).
Has anyone ever tried to write a formal syntax for all the entries
in /proc?   We have bits and pieces of /proc documentation in 
/usr/src/linux/Documentation, but nothing you could feed directly 
into a parser generator.  It'd be neat to have a good definition for /proc
in the LSB, and have an LSB conformance test that could look in
/proc and say "Yup, all the entries there conform to the spec and can
be parsed properly."
(
http://www.pathname.com/fhs/2.2-beta/fhs-2.2-beta.txt
 mentions /proc,
but doesn't standardize any of it, except to suggest that /etc/mtab
can be a symbolic link to /proc/mounts.)
