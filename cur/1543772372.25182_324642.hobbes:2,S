OK, 
http://affenbande.org/~tapas/rtc_wakeup/
 is the URL, right?
And LTP might well be a good home for it, I honestly don't know.
I am checking to see if this can be added to the set of tests run
in Martin's automated testing.  If you haven't looked at this, check

This doesn't cover all the various RT variants of Linux, but might
focus some attention on mainline latency issues.
