Subject: [q] signal_map still needed in struct exec_domain?

Hi brethren,
I noticed that setup_frame() (on all archs) is quite happy with
signal_invmap[] field of struct exec_domain and does not need the direct
map (signal_map). But all existing exec_domains (riscos, solaris etc)
still prepare both direct and inverse map arrays.
Why do they? Or should they not? Maybe some assembler routine does access
signal_map by hardcoded offset (like it is done e.g. for ENTRY(lcall7)
accessing exec_domain of the current's task_struct) in which case, I would
appreciate someone to point it out to me.
Thanks,
Tigran.
