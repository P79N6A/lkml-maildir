To expand on willy's note, the reason it's called mmiowb as opposed to 
iowb is because I/O port acccess (inX/outX) are inherently synchronous 
and don't need barriers.  mmio writes, however (writeX) need barrier 
operations to ensure ordering on some platforms.
This raises the question of what semantics the unified I/O mapping 
routines have... are ioreadX/iowriteX synchronous or should we define 
the barriers you mention above for them?  (IIRC ppc64 can use an io read 
ordering op).
