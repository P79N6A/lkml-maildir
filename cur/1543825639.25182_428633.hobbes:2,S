Hi folks,
Since I use forcedeth 0.49 the network connection for a virtual
PC running within VMware got horrible slow. The problem has
been discussed in
http://www.vmware.com/community/thread.jspa?messageID=408893
http://forums.fedoraforum.org/forum/showthread.php?t=105185
for example. Unfortunately the suggested workarounds don't
work for forcedeth.
I could reproduce the problem with the current 2.6.17-rc5.
Any helpful hint would be highly appreciated.
Regards
Harri
