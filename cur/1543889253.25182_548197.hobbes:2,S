Here the spinlock is needed only when mnt_busy goes to 0, so presumably
it won't be a serious problem on more or less common setups; however,
it certainly would need serious profiling.

Easy - grab namespace_sem, grab vfsmount_lock, walk the subtree and bump
mnt_busy on everything (by 1 + number of non-busy children).  Then drop
vfsmount_lock and do as usual, dropping references in tree being copied
as you go.  Nothing will get attached or detached due to namespace_sem,
nothing will get evicted by anybody other than you since you've got all
that stuff pinned down.  End of story...
