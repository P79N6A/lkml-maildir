I don't see how it can fail, I use it a lot (I would say exclusively)
to move patch between branches and never had a problem with it.

As frustrating as it can be, git is true. It is possible that you
have already merged the branch at an earlier step and that there
is nothing new to be merged. I really think that there is a little
thing wrong in your workflow that you need to find out to solve
your problems.

Yes, at this stage it's more a GIT-specific topic.

That's probably true. When I started, I whined about it because I
didn't understand it (nor the workflow). Marcello took the time
to explain me how he proceeded and from that point I started to
understand my mistakes and to become more and more a happy user.
Try to be descriptive about the things you do that don't work and
that you don't understand why, and post that to the GIT ML. I'm
sure someone there will be able to wipe out all your problems.
