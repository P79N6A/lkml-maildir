a) Why in Kconfig, why not in Makefile?
b) Of course nobody wants STABLE=n. :-)  How about:
config RELEASE
	bool "Build for release"
	help
	  If the kernel is declared as a release build here, then
	  various checks that are only of interest to kernel development
	  will be omitted.
c) A drawback of this general option is, it's hard to tell what will be
omitted in particular.
