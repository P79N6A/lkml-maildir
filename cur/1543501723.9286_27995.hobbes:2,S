Yes Riley,  i am well aware  of this behaviour, now  here is what i  get on
non-Linux systems:
					"-m"		"-p"
PC running NetBSD 1.3			i386		(error)
RS6000 running AIX 4.3			003500271800	(error)
Alpha running Digital Unix 4.0B		alpha		alpha
SUN running Solaris 2.5.1		sun4u		sparc
SGI running Irix 6.2			IP25		mips
HP9000 running HP/UX 10.20		9000/735	(error)
Looks like  i got  it the wrong  way round: "-m"  should have  the specific
architecture and  "-p" the  generic processor family...  Need to  check the
manuals how it should be, please stay tuned...
Yours,
  Dominik Kubla
