Hi there,
I'm running an athlon64 3000+ on an epox-mainboard.
after some bios-upgrades through their support I'm getting at least a bit
of powernow-support ;)
Through startup I'm getting these messages now:
powernow-k8: Found 1 AMD Athlon 64 / Opteron processors (version 1.00.09b)
powernow-k8:    0 : fid 0xc (2000 MHz), vid 0x2 (1500 mV)
powernow-k8:    1 : fid 0xa (1800 MHz), vid 0x6 (1400 mV)
powernow-k8:    2 : fid 0xa (1800 MHz), vid 0x6 (1400 mV)
powernow-k8: cpu_init done, current fid 0xc, vid 0x2
ACPI: (supports S0 S1 S4 S5)
Just to confirm: does that mean only these modes are supported? 
Wasn't there something down to 800 MHz for the athlon64-processors?
Is this a problem of the mainbord (aka still their bios ;)) or of
the driver?
Any way to workaround this?
Thanks in advance,
Thomas
