Ick, well you are describing a pretty pathalogical situation.  I suspect
for 99.9% of the users who would use this option, it will work just
fine, as they only have 1 user on the system at a time.
So, if you have multiple users on the physical system, then don't use
$local :)
Feel free to send a update to the documentation that illustrates this
limitation of the feature.
thanks,
