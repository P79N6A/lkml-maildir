It's not compiled in always on 32-bit platforms, because
     1.  Most people don't have more than 2TB in a single block device
     2.  64-bit sizes mean increased size of various structures (i.e.,
         less cache-friendly), and slightly slower operations.
On 64-bit platforms it *is* always enabled.
