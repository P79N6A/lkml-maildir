Well, I can do that, it seems, 100% of the time.
The method is to do "init 5" (my default runlevel is 3, because vts become 
unreadable after I start X), log into KDE (as a non-root), start some X apps 
at random (eg. I run gkrellm, kmail, konqueror, Mozilla FireFox 32-bit w/ 
Flash plugin, and konsole with "su -") and run updatedb (as root, of course).
Apparently, running updatedb is essential.  After it finishes, on my box, you 
can forget of suspending to disk from under the X+KDE combo, even if the X 
apps (ie. kmail, konqueror, FireFox) are stopped before.  However, if 
updatedb is not run, the box usually suspends successfully.
Greets,
