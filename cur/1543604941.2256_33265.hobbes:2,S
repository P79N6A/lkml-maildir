Hello Kirti, 
rather than doing it in kernel space why don't u do in userspace.
There's a lot of tools and libraries available! Take for example
tcpdump, ethereal, dniff and others as tools, libpcap (*nix packet
capturing library) or wincap (windows packet capturing library) and
many more. The kernel also provides a lot of other features via the
socket call to do these stuff. Could u please detail out what exactly
do u want to do and your major reason of getting inside the kernel ?
hope this helps..
