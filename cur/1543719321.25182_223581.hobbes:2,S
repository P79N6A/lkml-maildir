I think automatic IRQ binding business should belong to the user-level;
it can use generic statistics, application, or platform configuration
knowledge.
The kernel-level should have some simple chipset model, such as lowest
priority delivery mode with finer granularity of control. The kirqd at
this point, is doing automatic IRQ binding business as well today,
although it does not literally bind them. So I think we need to remove
that part of code from kirqd.
