Yes, that makes sense.
spin_lock_irqsave() really means "save the current irq mask
on the stack, then disable interrupts". spin_lock_irqrestore()
says "restore the current interrupt mask from the stack".  So they
nest, and spin_lock_irqsave() doesn't have to care whether or
not interrupts are currently enabled.
Using a global variable you could get something like:
CPU0:                                     CPU1
__cli();                                  
spin_lock_irqsave(lock, global)
                                          __sti();
                                          spin_lock_irqsave(lock2, global)
                                          spin_lock_irqrestore(lock2, global)
spin_unlock_irqrestore(lock, global)
/* interrupts should be disabled */
Here, CPU1 will set `global' to "interrupts enabled".  So when
CPU0 restores its flags from `global' it will be picking up
CPU1's flags, not its own!
There are probably less subtle failure modes than this..
