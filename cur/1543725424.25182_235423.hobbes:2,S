we already 'daemonize' softirqs in the stock kernel if the load is high
enough. (this is what ksoftirqd does) So the only question is a tunable
to make this deferring of softirq load mandatory. Yarroll's patch is
quite complex, i dont think that is necessary. It also has at least one
conceptual problem, the NOP-ing of local_bh_disable/enable in case of
CONFIG_SOFTIRQ_THREADS is clearly wrong. Yarroll?
I've added a very simple solution to daemonize softirqs similar to
Yarroll's patch to the -H5 version of voluntary-preempt:
 
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.8-rc2-H5
the 'level' of preemption is controlled via the value of
voluntary_preempt - a level of 2 (default) means that softirq-deferring
is done too. A level of 1 means only the extra preemption points are
activated, level 0 means the vanilla scheduling and softirq behavior.
below i've also attached a softirq.c patch against 2.6.8-rc2 that does
unconditional deferring. (this patch is of course not intended to be
merged upstream as-is, since normally we want to process softirqs right
after the irq context.)
