Go into the sound preferences menu of the app and check which device
it uses.  If it's something like /dev/dsp or /dev/audio it's using
OSS.  If it looks like "default" or "hw:0" it's ALSA.
If your app does not have any sound preferences menu it's broken and
you should file a bug report.
You can determine whether an app with no configurable sound device is
using ALSA by running "strace broken_app" and grep the output for
"/dev/dsp" or "/dev/audio".
