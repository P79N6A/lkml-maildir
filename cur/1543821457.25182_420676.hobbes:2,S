Yes; what I meant was:
- start listening the process event connector as firsk task on startup
- get a list of what files are being used (every second or something)
  by looking at /proc/$PID/* stuff
- mincore() all those files at the end of the bootup

Although this certainly looks simpler for userspace (and complete, if
you want to get absolutely all the info about files that get opened and
closed faster than the profile interval of a prefetcher) 
(another useful tool would be a dtrace-like thing)
