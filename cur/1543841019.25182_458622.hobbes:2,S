Ah, you've got it the wrong way round.
Because USB_STORAGE _selects_ SCSI rather than depending on it, even if SCSI
is disabled, USB_STORAGE can be enabled, and that turns on CONFIG_SCSI, even
if not all of its dependencies are available.
Run "make allyesconfig" and then try to turn off CONFIG_SCSI without this...
