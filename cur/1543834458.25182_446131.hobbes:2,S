Hello,
     I want to port an application to intel ixp with
snapgear 2.4.31. For SLIC / SLAC support in the board,
I want to use the DSP software from intel and the
version now available from intel site is
DSR2.6.2Release. But I am using intel ixp libs V2.0
and the doccumentation with the DSP s/w tells to use
ixp libs 1.4v. 
    May be because of that, when I am  making the
kernel I am getting some compilation errors
  Can anybody tell me whether there is any version of
DSR s/w which complys with ixp libs v2.0?
Thanks
Dennis
