errno is only valid until a new syscall is done. So I don't see the
problem with multiple sockets, you can only perform one at a time.

I wonder if the glibc keeps it's own copy of the sys_errlist[]. If it has,
that means that we indeed have a problem..
Maybe the kernel could provide errno -> textual mapping, but that sounds
like bloat to me..
An other way is to have some kind of extended error.

Disadvantage of textual stuff is that you can't do more then print it.
