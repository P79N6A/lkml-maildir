Being able to send or receive MIDI clock is a common feature for
hardware and software samplers, sequencers, etc.  It just allows more
flexibility in your setup.  I think currently Linux can receive MIDI
clock better than it can send.
To answer the last question I think the clock was not fine grained
enough.  But as far as timing requirements I don't actually know the
details.  Paul?
