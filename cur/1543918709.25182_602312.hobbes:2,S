Mmm... thanks for the tour.
The cpu hotplug code appears to take great precautions against internal races
(dunno if it succeeds or not, though), but the correspond code in native_smp_send_stop()
looks a bit iffy by comparison.  I wonder if that's where it gets stuck?
static void native_smp_send_stop(void)
{
       /* Don't deadlock on the call lock in panic */
       int nolock = !spin_trylock(&call_lock);
       unsigned long flags;
       local_irq_save(flags);
       __smp_call_function(stop_this_cpu, NULL, 0, 0);
       if (!nolock)
               spin_unlock(&call_lock);
       disable_local_APIC();
       local_irq_restore(flags);
}
So basically, it tries to avoid races by grabbing the call_lock,
but then ignores that lock and proceeds anyway.  Recipe for a race?
