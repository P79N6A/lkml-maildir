Gidday,
Some news:
* man-pages now has a website:
      
http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages
  The site includes HTML versions of the current set of man-pages.
* Starting with man-pages-2.69, each man page now includes a COLOPHON
  section at the end of the page which indicates the version of
  man-pages in which this page is released, and also contains a
  pointer to the man-pages web site.
Repeating some old news:
* As from now, my address as man-pages maintainer has changed
  to mtk.manpages@gmail.com.  (Mail to the old address will
  continue to work for a while, but eventually I will close
  that account.)
* The list linux-man@vger.kernel.org has been created for
  the purpose of discussing Linux man page bugs, patches,
  and maintenance.  To subscribe, send a message to
  majordomo@vger.kernel.org, with the body:
       subscribe linux-man
Back to the news as usual...
I recently released man-pages-2.69.
This release is now available for download at:
    
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/man-pages
    or 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/man-pages
    (Note the s/manpages/man-pages/ in these paths;
    a symlink with the old path will exist for
    a limited time.)
Changes in the release that may be of interest to readers of this list are
summarized below.
Cheers,
Michael
(man-pages maintenance is supported by Google, as a Google engineer 20%
