This is a module versioning warning.
I think it's caused by a b43 compiled against a different
kernel tree than the currently running ssb module.
Different may mean that only a tiny little thing was changed, which
might not affect the API at all. modversion will complain then.
I don't use module versioning, so I can't help you how to fix this.
I'd simply suggest turning off module versioning.
