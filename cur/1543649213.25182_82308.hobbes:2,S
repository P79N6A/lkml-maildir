There is the concept of non-distruptive dumping, which means
that you don't power off after a dump -- you keep running.  In
other words, you can silence the system and then resume after
a dump is taken.  It's a way of snapshotting the system state
which is possible today.

Wow ... we spent a ton of time moving all the code _out_ of the
arch directories as other kernel developers didn't want it there.

I realize what you're asking for, but I'm not sure this is the
right way to implement it.
From one perspective, the base dump driver is needed in order to
provide the upper level dumping capabilities as well as some of
the architecture-specific functionality.  That said, however, if
you make it a bool, it's either on or off -- some people don't
want it in the kernel all the time, and shouldn't be required
to build in.
Maybe understanding that dumping can be non-disruptive changes
your opinion on this?
