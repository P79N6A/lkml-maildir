I haven't gone back to devfs, but I feel your pain.  udev+hal worked fine 
for a couple months, until hald started intermittently locking up.  Now I 
can't go 2 days without a reboot, because hald so often goes into 
"uninterruptible sleep" and is totally unkillable.  I've upgraded udev, hal, 
and my kernel a bunch of times, but nothing has fixed this.  And it's not a 
single piece of hardware; sometimes it's USB, sometimes Firewire, sometimes 
a CDROM, that causes hald to take a nap, permanently.
