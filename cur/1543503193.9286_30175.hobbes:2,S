I like very much the first Stephen's patch since it's obviously right to
my eyes.  update_vm_cache is dead code and even if the fix may looks dirty
(but obviously right) it's fine for a 2.2.x release IMO.
If you want to include a different equivalnet patch to 2.2.11 I am
obviously fine as well, but original Stephen's patch does its works
without mistakes on the ext2/nfs side.
