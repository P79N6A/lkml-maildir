Sorry for the noise, it has happened again, but this time I had
sysreq active and it worked. CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE or 
ALT+FX didn't work. With sysreq I synced, umounted and 
rebooted without trouble.
I think that could be a mouse and/or X and/or Netscape problem,
since the system (apart input devices) was up and running.
