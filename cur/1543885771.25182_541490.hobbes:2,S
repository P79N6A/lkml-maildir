I'd say we need a different fix here. First, the question is whether there 
are any force-feedback devices, supported by USBHID force-feedback layer, 
which have a bluetooth version?
If there are none of them, we could just drop the FF initialization 
completely for now. 
On the other hand if there are such devices, just calling hid_ff_init() is 
presently not enough anyway, as the force feedback drivers for HID devices 
are currently USB-transport specific.
