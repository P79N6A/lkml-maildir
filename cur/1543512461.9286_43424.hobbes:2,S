[1.] One line summary of the problem:    
 2.2.13pre15 gives 'NULL ptr exception OOPS:' and 'hda: lost interrupt's
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
 SMP-CPU + IDE-HD PC
 gcc-2.7.2.3, egcs-1.1.2 and gcc-2.95.1
 *no* RAID support at all
        FYI:
I recompiled 2.2.13pre15 *both* with egcs-2.91.66 (egcs-1.1.2 release)
and gcc-2.7.2.3 as opposed to my previous one compiled with gcc-2.95.1
and, unfortunately, the 'NULL ptr exception + hda: lost interrupt'
issue are always present.
The box is a SMP-CPU + IDE-HD PC.
When this happens (usually when compiling or doing some massive HD
work like an rsync) I cannot access hda anymore and no kernel log is
written either (the logs are on hda). The only way out is power off
(since sync or shutdown or whatever hang) ... As a consequence I have
no data or OOPS: to present for debugging.
I did try to follow the thread about this on this kernel list but I am
not sure what kind of conclusion was taken. For one thing, 2.2.13pre14
(and, in fact, none of previous kernels) never had this
issue. Independent of the compiler and compiler flags I use. Also, my
uniprocessor Laptop does not have this issue either. Even with an -O6
optimised gcc-2.95.1 compiled 2.2.13pre15.
So it looks like something generic between 2.2.13pre14 and 2.2.13pre15
has given rise to this SMP-CPU + IDE-HD conflict. Should this change be undone?
Here is scripts/ver_linux (I am running 2.2.13pre14 now since that one
runs fine and I need the box reliably up).
