Hi,
For everyone interested, I have put together a patchset containing some "fresh"
patches related to suspend and hibernation, on top of 2.6.25-rc5, located at:
http://www.sisk.pl/kernel/hibernation_and_suspend/2.6.25-rc5/patches/
I have not yet decided what to do with patches 01-03.  Patch 03 will probably
be sent upstream soon.
Patch 04 is currently in the "test" branch of the ACPI tree and has been
tested already for some time in -mm and linux-next.
Patches 05-08, being mainly fixes, have just been sent upstream.
Patch 09, which I'm considering as the most important one, is the first of
a series that will introduce a new suspend and hibernation framework for
device drivers.  It introduces the highest-level structures and documents
them, so if you are planning any modifications in this area, have a look at it
and please let me know if there are any conflicts, so that we can avoid them.
Thanks,
Rafael
