And It's the same for the fork connector. It allows to send a message to
a user space application when a fork occurs by adding only one line (two
with the #include) in the kernel/fork.c file. Thus, the netlink
connector is a very simple and fast mechanism when you need to send a
small amount of information from kernel space to user space.
