Nice to see that this driver has made it into the kernel tree :-).
I've been thinking about adding proper sysfs and make things
somewhat customable from userspace. I'm not quite sure the working
point is optimal for all machines (the ambient temperature is also
a factor).
Btw, I would like to get reports about how well this driver works
with respect to noise reduction. I'm in particular interested
in the dual 1.4 GHz model...
