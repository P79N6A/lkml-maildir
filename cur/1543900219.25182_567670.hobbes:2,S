It could be - the original patch to reserve i_version_hi was submitted to
before the patches were ready to avoid that space being used by something
else.

The GOOT_OLD_INODE_SIZE check is needed to know if i_extra_isize is even
present or valid in the on-disk inode.

Because this is the in-memory version and it is always valid (set to zero
if there is extra space in the on-disk inode).
