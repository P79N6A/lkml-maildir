I forgot to add that this creates a bit of problem if "root = current"
is selected in LILO.
First of all, this could be the device or the disk as identified by the
label. Maybe the best approach would be to use both, and to try the
label first. If no corresponding disk is found, the kernel or whatever
mounts the root FS should fall back to using the device. This will
annoy those who really mean to use that specific device, but they can
of course configure it explicitly.
The second problem is how to obtain this information. Is scanning
/proc/mounts if the FS is ext2, and then system'ing dumpe2fs (or
dumpwhateverfs for other file systems) the "right" approach ? Looks a
bit messy to me.
