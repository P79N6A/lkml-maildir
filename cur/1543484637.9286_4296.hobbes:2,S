    No, it simply means that the FSF will go skipping merrily down the
    same path as the OSF did with X11.  Eventually they'll reach the
    brick wall, and then they'll have to hurry back to the start of the
    path to catch up to the people who are continuing to work on the
    more free version of the code.

    david parsons \bi/ If the FSF wants to commit suicide, it's their code
                   \/               and they can do what they want with it.
