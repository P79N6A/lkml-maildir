Well, I did not really look into udev but hotplug (which can iteract
with udev) does not keep anything. If it fails its ok - that's why
there are coldplug scripts that "recover" lost events. But here we
block trying to start hotplug - we not getting an error - and this is
bad. Unfortunately I am not familiar with block devices working to say
why it hangs.
Should we pull Jens into the discussion?
