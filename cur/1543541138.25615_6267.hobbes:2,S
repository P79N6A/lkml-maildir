Hmm.I'm looking into vgacon and I just cannot get idea why ordering 
of vgacon_switch and vga_set_palette can matter, as vgacon_switch is 
simple memcpy() and vga_set_palette just programs palette... Looking 
at code again...  Oops. Hey, James made a bug... Code in console.c 
should read
if (redraw) {
   int updateregion;
   
   set_origin(currcons);
   updateregion = sw->con_switch(vc_cons[currcons].d);
   set_palette(currcons);
   if (updateregion && (vcmode != KD_GRAPHICS))
      do_update_region(currcons, origin, screenbuf_size / 2);
}
as con_switch does not return success/failure, but it returns whether
screen was repainted by con_switch (0) or whether update_region should
be invoked (1)... I believe that it will solve your problem.
If it solves your problem, tell me and I'll resend patch below
to Linus.
