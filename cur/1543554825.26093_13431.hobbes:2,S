Thanks a bunch.

The kernel driver APIs are designed so that SMP and UP cases are equally
high-performance, and portable beyond the x86 platform.
Pretty much all ISA and PCI drivers need to be portable and SMP safe...
if not so, it's a bug.  That said, there is certainly more motivation to
make a popular PCI driver is SMP safe than an older ISA driver.  And
portability is [IMHO] less of a priority than SMP safety, though it
depends on the hardware being supported.
