	Hi;
	By default, my hdparm numbers and my kernel build time
benchmark were worse on all 2.6 vs. 2.4 kernels, until I tried:
/sbin/hdparm -a 4096 /dev/hdx
eg. (typical averages)
2.4.21:
Timing buffered disk reads:   80 MB in  3.07 seconds =  26.06 MB/sec
2.6.0-test5:
Timing buffered disk reads:   68 MB in  3.06 seconds =  22.21 MB/sec
2.6.1: [readahead 4096]
Timing buffered disk reads:   90 MB in  3.02 seconds =  29.82 MB/sec
2.6.0-test10 building 2.4.18-packet (personal config) gcc3.2.3 glibc2.3.2
