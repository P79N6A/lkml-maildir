On my Multia it will not even link because of missing symbols __ioremap
and virt_to_phys in drivers/video/fbmem.c.  I had to make the little
change below do get it to  know about these. But apparently this is not
enough, because it would then bomb out during compilation with:
  fbmem.c: In function `fb_mmap':
  fbmem.c:559: warning: passing arg 1 of `virt_to_phys' makes pointer from integer without a cast
  fbmem.c:559: too many arguments to function `virt_to_phys'
I'll try to track this one down. Just wanted to let you know that there
are some missing pieces...
Yours,
  Dominik Kubla
