Hi!
After about 20 resume cycles (compiled kernel with swsusp making
machine suspend/resume) I got that nasty FS corruption, again.
So... 
1) Maybe your ext3 patches are not at fault.
2) Be carefull using swsusp patch. Real carefull.
3) Don't trust fsck. At this kind of corruption, e2fsck 1.19 will
report "clean" but will not repair it, putting your fs into
self-destruct mode. Bad bad. Its fixed on new versions. Always run
fsck twice, second time with -f.
