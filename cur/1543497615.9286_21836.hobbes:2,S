It can't load a supplementary image from CD - the supplementary image was 
never available from the CD via the INT 13h emulation in the first place.
You'd need a floppy drive, and to put the supplementary image on a floppy.
Or recreate the install image as a hard drive image, rather than a floppy disk 
image, so it has enough space for the SCSI drivers on it. Note that most 
BIOSes apparently don't support this, though.
Or make a _huge_ initrd, and boot with loadlin or something similar which can 
read the initrd from the CD.
