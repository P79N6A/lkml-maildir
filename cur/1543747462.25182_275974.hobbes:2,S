Thanks, this has the makings of something really useful.
One comment.  Links to external documentation (like the AGP
reference for eg) has the potential to 'disappear', making
this resource no better than a collection of bookmarks.
A true repository would have the actual documents, though
I understand this may mean talking with the copyright holder(s).
