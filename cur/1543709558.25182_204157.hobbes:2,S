Ugh ? No, the kernel doesn't contain a routine that you can
use to flush the entire cache. It contains and use routines
to flush regions of the dcache & icache, and those can prefectly
be used in userland. In fact, none of the cache flush code is
relying on supervisor mode, you don't need to add a syscall for
that, just copy the code you need in userland.

That's wrong. You should flush the cache over the range
where you need it flushed. Also, there are very few reasons
why one would want to flush the dcache, so it would be interesting
to know what you are really trying to do.

That is only used on some embedded CPUs afaik.
