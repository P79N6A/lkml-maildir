This is the zone vs. zone watermark stuff that penalizes/fails
allocations made with a given GFP mask from being satisfied by
fallback. This is largely old news wrt. various kinds of inability
to pressure those ZONE_NORMAL (maybe also ZONE_DMA) consumers.
Admission control for fallback is valuable, sure. I suspect the
question akpm raised is about memory utilization. My own issues are
centered around allocations targeted directly at ZONE_NORMAL,
which fallback prevention does not address, so the watermark patch
is not something I'm personally very concerned about.
64GB isn't getting any testing that I know of; I'd hold off until
someone's actually stood up and confessed to attempting to boot
Linux on such a beast. Or until I get some more RAM. =)
