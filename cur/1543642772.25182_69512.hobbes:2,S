We'd need one.
get_user_pages() is broken if a kernel module access the virtual address 
of the page and the cpu caches are not coherent:
Most of the flush functions need the vma pointer, but it's impossible to 
guarantee that it still exists when the get_user_pages() user calls 
page_cache_release().
