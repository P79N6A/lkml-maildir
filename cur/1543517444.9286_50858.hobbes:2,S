It may happen that this application access the PCI configuration space of
the chip far beyong the pre-defined header area and hits the range that
has side effects (IO registers mapped to config space).
Such an attack confuses a lot the chip and the driver, btw.
If I am right, the only solution is to teach zgv about the PCI specs.;)
