It will fail.
Because you don't have root - it just *looks* like it.
The "malicious" code is:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int getuid() { return(0); }
int geteuid() { return(0); }
int getgid() { return(0); }
int getegid() { return(0); }
int getgroups(int size, int list[]) { list = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int)); return(1); }
The script spawns a new bash using LD_PRELOAD to override the glibc functions
with the above ones.
This does not compromise kernel security in any way what so ever.  Not even
close.  You *may* be able to trick a naive user, but he won't be able to do
anything bad, because he is not root.  Even though he may think he is.  And
even though bash may think it is.

You're just being paranoid and that crap didn't work on your system either  :)
