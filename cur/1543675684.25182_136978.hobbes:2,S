no, no, this is not what i wanted to say. but i couldn't image why this 
problem does not show up on other ppl's computers too. if more ppl 
complain - the keyboard guys might take a look at it. sorry for being 
unclear.

i guess the worst thing is: ther is no error message. if i only had an 
error message one would know where to look at. but i only have these 
weird behaviour. i could post usb-debug messages, if it only would help.
i already got a workaround for me, see my other post.
Thank you,
Christian.
