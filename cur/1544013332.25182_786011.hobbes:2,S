Ah, the buzz words. ;)
The tux3 mailing list contains quite some design notes about these 
concepts. I think others can give better answers about these concepts - I 
think I understood what it is for, not the implementation details. But 
basically "atomic commit" is a strategy to have the filesystem always in 
a consistent state and btree-based versioning allows to keep different 
versions of a file / directory around. And unlike other filesystem tux3 
has this per inode and not for the complete filesystem. At least if I 
understand correctly.
But at least it should clear that tux3 is a filesystem and not a video 
game ;).

Right now its still in heavy development and not of release quality. I.e. 
something to play around and test with if you want. 
Ciao,
