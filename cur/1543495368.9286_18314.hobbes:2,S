Because that's how it works! Every memory access, read or write, adjusts
ECC data. If it's a write, the compare-with-previous (actually an XOR)
operation is skipped.

Yes it does! Since it's part of the memory controller and the RAM itself,
it doesn't add time, the value of the ECC is known well before the slower
RAM access actually occurs. It's a parallel operation.

If ECC is correctable, the memory controller may introduce a wait-state.
It depends upon the RAM speed. Basically, with ECC, the controller knows
what the data must be if it is correctable. Some controllers on some
machines DEC/Alpha rewrite corrected data. This takes extra time,
hence the wait-state. 
Otherwise, the NMI line on the CPU is operated.
