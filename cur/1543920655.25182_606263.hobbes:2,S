Two, just see the bus numbers of the devices. (However, there might be
additional buses with no devices present and in case these are connected
to a separate host bridge, they need not be visible.)
> 4. Does the system have a PCI-X bus?
Yes, the devices on bus 01 are PCI-X devices, so there is a PCI-X bus.
> 2. Do any of the PCI buses support 66 MHz operation?
Yes, PCI-X does.

This cannot be inferred from the lspci output -- there is no way how to
tell if a bus has physical slots or it exists only internally.
				Have a nice fortnight
