Is gforce calling sched_yield?
Can you try testing with some simpler loads, like these:
memload:
#!/usr/bin/python
a = "a" * 16 * 1024 * 1024
while 1:
    b = a[1:] + "b"
    a = b[1:] + "c"
execload:
#!/bin/sh
exec ./execload
forkload:
#!/bin/sh
./forkload&
pipeload:
#!/usr/bin/python
import os
pi, po = os.pipe()
if os.fork():
  while 1:
    os.write(po, "A" * 4096)
else:
  while 1:
    os.read(pi, 4096)

Mathematics is the supreme nostalgia of our time.
