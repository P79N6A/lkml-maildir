Stephen, I'v etold you before: I will not accept these kinds of extensions
to ext2. Make a new filesystem, and if you want, re-use the code (and the
layout) of ext2.
There's not a chance in hell that I will ever release a kernel with these
kinds of major fs modifications - call it "ext3" and after a year or so of
in-production use we can drop ext2.
