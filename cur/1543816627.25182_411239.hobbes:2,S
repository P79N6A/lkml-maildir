With respect to sg vs. scsi, it is.

For the host ID ACK, but some transports do support channel/ID/LUN. In
/these/ cases having them exported is a sane thing to do. I don't even try
to argue if it's better to use sysfs or ioctl.

ACK, and having an address space of 340 * 10^36 will make it perfectly
clear. One day a subsystem might hand out ID and LUN cookies instead of
counters, and a certain table of sg numbers will stop fitting in memory.
I'm just handing out the bigger gun with the automatic foot-finder.-)

Schedule for removal?
As I understand, having a /dev/sd0815 corresponding to a /dev/sg4711 is
the root of all evil and idiotic things, and moving all sg functions into
the apropiate place is the sane thing to do.
This patch is a part of the process, and as soon as all sg functions are
available using /dev/s[dtr]*, the corresponding sg devices should be
deprecated and removed.
