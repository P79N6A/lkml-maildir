Yes it would, there's no one to wake the reader up. So if you are
unlucky enough that no one else attempts to read from that queue, you
would be stuck forever.

That would work as well, indeed. You would move the special casing to
get_request_wait() and require an extra queue lock/unlock. Hmm. I think
the starved flag is more obviously correct and the cost is not really big
at all, it's just an unlikely check in the request freeing for the fast
case of not being oom. get_request_wait() is hit a lot more than the
additional __freed_request() would be.
