Hello
I have a friend that his Msc project is related with the development 
over a PCI-X card. the problem is that he do not know if the Linux 
kernel support the PCI-X bus. i try to find something related with the 
PCI-X in the kernel source but i didn't found any file or folder with a 
relevant name... Does any one know if PCI-X bus supported from Linux and 
if no how can he patch the kernel to support it...?
Thanks
Chris
