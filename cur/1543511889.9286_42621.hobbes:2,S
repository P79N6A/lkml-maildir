Basically, yes.  (see attached)

Recompile, and make sure /dev is correct.  I don't really see a problem with
that.

Actually, it does come from somewhere.  From /etc/init.d/checkroot.sh
#
# Remount rootfs rw (default), but do not try to change mtab because it
# is on a ro fs until the remount succeeded.  Then clean up old mtabs and
# finally write the new mtab.
#
mount -n -o remount,rw /
rm -f /etc/mtab~ /etc/nologin
: > /etc/mtab
mount -o remount,rw /
mount /proc
mount adds the mtab entry from /etc/fstab for /  Seen it many times before. 
Especially when the root dev was say, /dev/sdb1 instead of /dev/sda1 (and
/etc/mtab was incorrect)

What do you mean, abuse stat?

Where does getfsfile get it's information from?  The kernel?  I don't have a
manpage for it.

Actually, we could just put the contents of root= in /proc/mounts, couldn't
we?

Actually, it would probably be correct in saying /dev/nfs.  I'm not sure
what the point of having the / listed in /proc/mounts as being correct
anyway.  The kernel always knows how to do -o remounts with it (and any
other file system), and is never unmountable so you couldn't unmount then
mount back.
Maybe I'm confused as to what you wanted in the first message.  How is it
helpful?  (of course, it could be annoying)  I thought about making a script
that would actually create /dev/root and it be a symlink to the real device.
