Right here :)
Any driver that needs direct access to the interrupts can use Adeos' interrupt
pipeline. Your driver's low-level operations should be fairly easy to port to
Adeos.
Since Adeos' release, such porting of code has actually been successfully
done a couple of times already. Apart from Philippe's porting of the Xenomai
interface, here's an interesting tidbit that appeared on the Adeos mailing
list:

Feel free to post any questions to Adeos' mailing list. It's been quite
active lately and I'm sure your application will interest others.
Adeos' web site is at:
http://www.freesoftware.fsf.org/adeos/
If you're looking for an introduction to Adeos' functionality have a look
at the original LKML announcement:
