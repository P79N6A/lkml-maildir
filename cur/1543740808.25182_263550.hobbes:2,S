Please revert that change until we have made absolutely sure that msleep(1)
on a HZ=1000 machine will actually sleep at least 1ms, this is really not
clear since it will end up doing schedule_timeout(1) which, afaik, will
only guarantee to sleep up to the next jiffie, which can be a lot shorter
than the actual duration of a jiffie.
Ben.
