A lot of these add extra complications for anybody not wanting a
'simple' kernel config.  _Please_ don't re-design everything the same
way as the once-simple filesystems menu.
Too much prompting is irritating for advanced users, and they are the
people who are likely to compiling the most kernels, rather than
sticking with the kernel that came with their distribution.
