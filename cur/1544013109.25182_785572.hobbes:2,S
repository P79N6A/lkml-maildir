There were only theses handful or errors that I encounter in my setup.
"quite_error" in my mind was to meant to mean that the error message
could be suppressed by the new BH_Quiet flag.

I will remove the mucking with of the printk_ratelimit as to not disturb
its current implementation.

It is unclear to me so I will refrain from touching it.

sorry about that :(

Thanks for the review and information about the helper functions.  It
will be Monday before I will be able to retest/resend a new patch. 
Thanks,
