I want to wait for a short time in a driver after I got an interrupt that data
arrived.
I do not like the 
while( (jiffies-time_start) < 1 ); 
since it is too long and blocks the whole cpu from doing sensible stuff.
Back in 1996 eberhard moenkemaier wrote in this list:
----
 
/*
 * * kernel mode waiting, time unit is jiffy (10 ms)
 * */
static void jiffy_sleep(u_int time)
{
current->state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
current->timeout = jiffies + time;
schedule();
}
The task gets re-scheduled if the time has elapsed.
Calling it with 0 gives an indefinite short time, just allowing
other kernel mode tasks to get the CPU. }

Is this still applicable and racecondition-save?
