The Cray XD-1, opteron-based machine, is linuxbios only. Another 
machine, DRC, can only use linuxbios. Island/Aruma was mentioned. These 
are the three I know of, there may well be others.
DRC used linuxbios because fuctory bios could not configure HT correctly 
in their application.
(well, I know of one other, but can't tell you about it).
