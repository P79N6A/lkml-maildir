No, it's right. Weird but right :)
Look at the whole thing
	if ((xtal > 26900) && (xtal < 27100))
		xtal = 2700;
	else if ((xtal > 14200) && (xtal < 14400))
		xtal = 1432;
	else if ((xtal > 29400) && (xtal < 29600))
		xtal = 2950;
	else {
		printk(KERN_WARNING "xtal calculation failed: %ld\n", xtal);
		return -1;
	}
Ohhh, and I know it's ugly, it comes straight from XFree through.
Don't bother too much with that code, I'm not even sure it works
properly at this point, I need to test it by intentionally disabling
the BIOS detection to check it actually picks the right values.
