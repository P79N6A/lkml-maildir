Subject: [PATCH] Firewall frag vulnerability.

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

--------
Alan, Dave (for 2.3), please apply.
This is the patch as reported to bugtraq, except it doesn't drop
truncated UDP and TCP packets which *aren't* fragments.  I remember
going over this code convincing myself that it was safe.  How *&%!ing
embarrassing.
