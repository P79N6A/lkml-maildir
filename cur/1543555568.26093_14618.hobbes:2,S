Oops, that means that merely reading a file followed by powerfail can
lead to you loosing the file. Oops.
Besides: you can do this in userspace with existing e2compr. Should take
less than 2 days to implement.

Results: NOP at machines that are never on in that time, random corruption
after powerfail between 0:00-6:00, ..				Pavel
