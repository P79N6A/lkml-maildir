I'm working on that. Once I've discovered why enabling plugging causes nbd
to hang, then I'll send a patch assuming nobody beats me to it :-)

I tested the patch with a printk() which printed whenever the new call to the
request function was triggered. It didn't happen once in normal fs use
with ext2 on a scsi disk. From the code I think its not even possible for
this to be called at all for a device which has plugging. For a plugged
device when I/O comes in, there appear to be only two cases:
 - Device queue empty. Device gets plugged. New request_fn call not called
 - Device queue not empty. New I/O added to back of queue. New request_fn
   not called (it only gets called when the I/O is added to the front of
   the queue).
I think nbd is the only device which doesn't use plugging at the
moment (from a quick grep of the kernel source),
Steve.
