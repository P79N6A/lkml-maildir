First, is it worth it?
IOW, are there real setups out there wishing to have user space XIP 
while the kernel itself isn't XIP?
Because right now you only need to turn on CONFIG_MTD_XIP for XIP user 
space to just work, regardless of whether the kernel itself is XIP or 
not.  And of course CONFIG_MTD_XIP is mandatory if you want to write to 
flash with a XIP kernel.
