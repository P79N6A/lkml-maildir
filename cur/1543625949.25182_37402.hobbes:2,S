  Hi, all. Version 199.10 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
Patch directly available from:
ftp://ftp
.??.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rgooch/v2.4/devfs-patch-current.gz
AND:
ftp://ftp.atnf.csiro.au/pub/people/rgooch/linux/kernel-patches/v2.4/devfs-patch-current.gz
This is against 2.4.19-pre4. Highlights of this release:
- Changed <devfs_rmdir> to allow later additions if not yet empty
- Added calls to <devfs_register_partitions> in drivers/block/blkpc.c
  <add_partition> and <del_partition>
- Updated README from master HTML file
- Fixed bug in <devfs_alloc_unique_number>: was clearing beyond
  bitfield
- Fixed bitfield data type for <devfs_*alloc_devnum>
- Made major bitfield type and initialiser 64 bit safe
				Regards,
					Richard....
