Step back for a moment.  I know of phttpd and zeus.  They both have 
a serious problem: they fall down when the load on the system exceeds 
the capabilities of the cpu.  If you'd bother to take a look at the 
aio api I'm proposing, it has less overhead under heavy load as events 
get coalesced.  Even then, the overhead under light load is less than 
signals or select or poll.
