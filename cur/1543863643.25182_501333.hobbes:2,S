I'm in the process of testing the (backported) capabilities patch 
and Kaigai's userspace tools on a SLES10 based x86-64 target (2.6.16).  
Chris Friedhoff's examples (
http://www.friedhoff.org/fscaps.html
)
run cleanly.  That said, can one expect, through the use of these
enhanced capabilities, to be able to add some finer grain 
capabilities based on a specific userid?  In Chris' ping example,
the suid is removed from /bin/ping to restrict it to root, and a 
capability added to allow any user to execute it.  Can that example
be extended to make it so only a _particular_ user can execute it?
I realize with SELinux, one could achieve the goal, but as a stopgap,
can capabilities be used to get there?
Thanks,
Bill
