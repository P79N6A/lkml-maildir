It still doesn't make sense when the user only pressed a single key,
or in some cases, never pressed *any* key (don't have that report to hand,
but it was a laptop keyboard)

When you're on the recieving end of distro kernel bug reports, it becomes clearer :)
Users read dmesg from time to time, and freak out when they see something
like this that looks like an error that they can't do anything about.
Until I silenced these in the Fedora kernel I was getting quite a few reports
from concerned users.
