nope, it's tricky, check out the define of IRQ_EXIT_OFFSET, it has the
plus 1 count added already.
using preempt_disable() has the problem of putting a barrier() between the
++ and the -IRQ_OFFSET, causing one more instruction to be generated.
but there was another (not too critical) bug here - irq_enter() needs to
have a barrier() after manipulating the preemption count, irq_exit() needs
to have a barrier() before. Fixed in my tree.
