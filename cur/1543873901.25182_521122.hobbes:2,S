FYI, the revoke implementation have since been changed to follow the
badfs-style approach of the forced unmount patches. However, there are
some problems with the forced unmount patches that are now fixed in
the revoke implementation:
  - You can't use munmap() to take down shared memory mappings because the
    application can accidentally remap something completely different
to that region.
  - The ->f_light bits slow down other fget_light() users and  there's
a race between
    fcheck_files() and set_f_light().
  - The operation can live-lock if a malicious process keeps forking. The revoke
    implementation solves this by revoking in two passes: (1) take
down the descriptors
    and (2) take down the actual inodes.
