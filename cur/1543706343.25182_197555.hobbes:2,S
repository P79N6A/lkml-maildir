Subject: 2.6: QoS scheduling not working with IP-over-IP

Hello.
There seems to be a bug in QoS scheduling code related to IP-over-IP
tunnels (ipip.ko).  My setup is a bit unusual -- my default route
goes through tunl1, so I want it shaped.  It worked fine with 2.4,
but it doesn't with 2.6 (2.6.1 and 2.6.2, I made a transition quite
recently).
The simplest example is:
tc qdisc add dev tunl1 root prio
...executing this line will effect in no packet entering or leaving
device (as if device was down).  Just as soon as I do
tc qdisc del dev tunl1 root
...everything returns to normal.  And same problem applies to
HTB scheduler, though adding a qdisc doesn't result in such
packet freeze.  But as soon as some class is added, all packets
matching that class "freeze".  A simple example would be:
# everything is OK here
tc qdisc add dev tunl1 handle 1:  root htb default 9 r2q 1
# ...and so is here...
tc class add dev tunl1 parent 1:1 classid 1:9 htb rate 2mbit ceil 2mbit
# ...oops, packets are blocked, until you remove this class or qdisc.
If that is of any help, I set up the tunnel like this:
ip tunnel add tunl1 mode ipip local 192.168.4.55 remote 192.168.1.1
ip addr add 11.22.33.44/32 dev tunl1
ip link set tunl1 up
ip route add default src 11.22.33.44 dev tunl1
Also, SFQ and RED appear immune to this problem.
  Regards,
   Dawid
PS: 2.6.2 kernel on 2 x Pentium-III SMP system, unpatched, QoS
(prio, sfq, red) compiled as modules.
