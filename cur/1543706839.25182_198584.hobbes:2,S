Maciej,
You're right.  This bug is in mp_config_ioapic_for_sci(), which calls
io_apic_set_pci_routing(), which uncondnitionally calls
add_pin_to_irq().  Problem is that this IRQ has already been initialized
back in setup_IO_APIC_irqs().
Clearly in this case we shouldn't be calling io_apic_set_pci_routing()
at all.  But I've got to look more closely at the case where the SCI is
not identity mapped before simply ripping it out.
thanks,
-Len
