As you say _usually_, even you admit that sometimes you would want the 
real owner/permissions to be shown.  And that is the point Miklos is 
trying to make I believe: it should be configurable not hard set to only 
one which is what I understand HCH wants.
There are uses for both.  For example today I was updating the tar ball 
which is used to create the var file system for a new chroot.  I certainly 
want to see corretly setup owner/permissions when I look into that tar 
ball using a FUSE fs...
Best regards,
