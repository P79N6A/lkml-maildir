Don't like this though - can't we pass a real size here rather than zero?
There seems to be several clues as to the maximum size:
#define cmapsz 8192
        if (!vga_font_is_default)
                charmap += 4 * cmapsz;
                        charmap += 2 * cmapsz;
                                for (i = 0; i < cmapsz; i++)
                                        vga_writeb(arg[i], charmap + i);
so that's about 7 * cmapsz - call that 8 for completeness, which is 64K.
