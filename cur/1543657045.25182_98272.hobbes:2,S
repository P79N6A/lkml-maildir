We use linux-abi patch on up kernel 2.4.x. Since we may need to use smp in
the future I started looking for possible problems, and found this patch
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=731594&forum_id=3421.
Even if the patch is meant to solve an issue when using linux-abi, the
author says the problem is not linux-abi specific, but it's a general
problem in the kernel. 
Can you give your opinion about that patch?
Thanks
