Actually I was using the built-in cryptoloop, not aes, I was just noting
that on a really slow CPU it's still usefully fast in my estimation.

Yes, I delighted that cryptoloop is in the kernel. The dm-crypt is an
interesting method suitable for technically adept users who do all their
own sysadmin and need better crypto to protect something very valuable or
illegal.
But for a company trying to protect information on laptops from casual
laptop theves, the existing cryptoloop is fine, and the greater complexity
of dm-crypt isn't cost effective. Speed isn't an issue, ease of use and
avoiding training costs is.
