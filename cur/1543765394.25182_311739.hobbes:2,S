Hi,
In Fedora Core3, interruptible_sleep_on() checks if the system is
lock_kernel()'ed
by SLEEP_ON_BKLCHECK. Same thing is done in RedHatEL4.
Also I found a patch including SLEEP_ON_BKLCHECK was posted before,
but is not included in 2.6.11.
Why SLEEP_ON_BKLCHECK checks lock_kernel ? Lock_kernel shoud be held
during sleep_on_timeout? And I also wonder why 2.6.11 does not check it.
Thank you,
