And when you start flaming, PLEASE CHANGE THE SUBJECT LINE!
I am EXCEEDINGLY INTERESTED in finding a solution to the 
killing-the-wrong-task problem, because I have 50 Linux boxes that do it 
all the time.  ANY discussion to that topic deserves my time.  Discussions 
of signature blocks does not -- nothing bores me more, in fact.
So either post on topic, or change the subject line.
I'm saying "please."
