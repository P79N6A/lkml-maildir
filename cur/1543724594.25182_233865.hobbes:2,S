Hi everyone,
I want to add functionality to the printk function such that I can read
values off sk_buff and print them to a file specified by me rather than
the kernel defined files. So what I want to do is add a new option
like KERN_INFO.
Does anyone know of a documentation or has ideas on how I can go about
doing this ?
Thanks,
Rahul.
