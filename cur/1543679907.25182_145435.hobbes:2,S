Hello,
   I've been using 2.5.x since about .58 or so, never had any problems. Last I had .69, and I tried to upgrade to 2.5.72 for some new options (got a sharp zaurus). When I tried it, I got this error:
[snip]
BIOS EDD Facility V0.09 2003-Jan-22, 1 device found
VFS: Cannot open root device "sda3" or sda3
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kenrel Panic: VFS: Unable to mount root FS on sda3
I've been using for over 3 years now, never had a problem with this. I have a Adaptec 2940 Ultra2 SCSI adapter (OEM), I compiled the currect "module" into the kernel, just like I always have. When 2.5.72 wouldn't work, I went back and tried each one to .70, and non worked. Not even the lastest .74 works. I have changed nothing in my config file besides the USB network, which I have tried with and without, showing the same errors.
Any help on this would be great!
