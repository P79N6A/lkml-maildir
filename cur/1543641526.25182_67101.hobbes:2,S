devfs doesn't hold a candle to io_apic.c
I did 3 runs on a 32x last night, and got 3 panics not present in 2.4:
(1) "Recompile kernel with bigger MAX_IO_APICS!.\n",
	so I bumped up MAX_IO_APICS to "impossibly huge"
(2) "Max APIC ID exceeded!\n", so I removed the physid reprogramming
(3) "ran out of interrupt sources!",
	and I chugged a stiff drink, gave up, & went to bed (this is evil)
Reducing NR_CPUS tends to trigger some kind of physical APIC ID
reprogramming panic() (msg #2 above) that doesn't normally happen.
Cheers,
Bill
