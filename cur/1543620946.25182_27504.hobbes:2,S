It is basically a normal file with inode number 0 (this is defined in the 
ntfs specifications) which contains all metadata concerning all inodes 
(including the metadata describing the $MFT itself[1]).
Best regards,
Anton
[1] Yes, this is a circular reference, but the partition's bootsector 
contains sufficient information to resolve it unambiguously by pointing you 
to the disk sectors containing the metadata for $MFT itself). This is also 
why it has to be inode zero, otherwise the resolution of the circular 
reference wouldn't work any more.
