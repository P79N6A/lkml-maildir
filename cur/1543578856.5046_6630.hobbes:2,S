I do have a 3c503 and a ne2k-pci both of them use the 8390, I can hang
the ne2k-pci easily by doing a ping -f, bigger packet size => early the
hang. But I cannot hang the 3c503 by doing this.
Now with 2.4.0 the ne2k-pci behaviour is that: doing a ping -f works for
some amount of time, then stops for a BIG amount of time (various
minutes), and then it works again (it seems), but at a much slower
speed, and if you test it with normal ping (ping host) you don't get
replies.
The packets really go down to the wire and I even got replies. but I
don't receive it.
Previous versions of 2.4.0-testX caused ne2k-pci to hang and remain
hanged until reboot.
