Hi Roland,
I have reviewed the qos patches and provided comments which were 
deployed in v2 of the series. I also tested it (ipoib and iser which is 
rdma-cm based) against the Voltaire SM/SA to see that nothing was 
broken. I will send you a "reviewed by:" signature.

The IGMP enabling patch posted by me on September 2nd isn't on your list
http://lists.openfabrics.org/pipermail/general/2007-September/040250.html
can you add it?

Jay Vosburgh, the bonding driver maintainer just sent an ack on all 
patch series. As for the IPoIB changes, there are three patches, where 
two of them, namely

are handling a corner-case problems pointed by Michael Tsirkin.
Michael, will you be able to look on it and provide a reviewed-by 
signature? the third patch
> [PATCH 03/11] IB/ipoib: Bound the net device to the ipoib_neigh structue
is somehow much more simple, I don't think more review is needed for it.

Just for the record, the 'etc' above relates to the interrupt moderation 
support (mlx4, core, ipoib {config through ethertool, usage). Among 
other things, what is not clear to me here is if/how this goes 
hand-in-hand with NAPI.
As you saw the patch adding checksum offload support had a long thread, 
and I think the discussion has reached the point where Michael is 
waiting for your take on it.
As for the LSO, LRO patches, I did not see any review comment.
I will see that I can review from the series, to begin with, will send 
Eli some comments and questions.

This patch series is somehow important as without them iser is useless 
over connectx. Can be nice if you merge this and at max fix the abuse later.
Or.
