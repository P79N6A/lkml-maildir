When I started fscaps, xattr were new to me and I didn't understand
how to use them. So, I went and made a small and independent patch.
If you're interested in an xattr based approach, you may look at
<
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/security/linux-privs/>,
 which is
very old or at <
http://www.stanford.edu/~luto/linux-fscap/>,
 which is
a more recent implementation.
As serge pointed out, there's a third from Nicholas Hans Simmonds.
Regards, Olaf.
