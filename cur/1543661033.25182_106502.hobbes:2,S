It should be within the bootloader, and the kernel should have an
option not to switch to the console until the login prompt, (I.E. use
two pages of VGA memory, and have the console initialised and being
written to, but not displayed until it either oopses, (in which case
you just toggle the bits in the VGA memory to switch to the other
page, simple enough to do), or as the last task before init is run).

For the same reason we got rid of the in kernel boot loader.  If it's
there, it'll get used, which is a bad thing.
