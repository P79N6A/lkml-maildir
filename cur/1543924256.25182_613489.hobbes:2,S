SMP should depend on BROKEN for now, and I thought it did.

For this, my immediate reaction is that if you're going to build
something, the dependencies should be there.  However, I guess we
should have some sympathy for the automatic allyesconfig builders.
I'm wondering whether, instead of failing the build if headers or
libraries aren't available, compile in some sort of stub which will
produce a run-time error instead.
The violates my preference to have error detected as early as
possible, but maybe it's preferable to the current situation.
