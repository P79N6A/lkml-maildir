This is.  I retain the hope that someone will implement project based 
accounting.  Currently, most of the CSA users on Linux are using it for 
system tuning.  The users tend to be people trained in using CSA on Irix 
as one tuning tool and have carried that experience over to Linux.

Both the job and process accounting record are only generated on process 
termination.  The same problems will exist.
