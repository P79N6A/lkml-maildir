Yes, Rusty's proposal (as I think I summarized above) would do exactly
that: the only address that you'll ever see for a per-CPU variable
will be the canonical one.  The get/set macros can use an alias on
platforms where this is more efficient, but the alias will never be
visible outside the macros.
