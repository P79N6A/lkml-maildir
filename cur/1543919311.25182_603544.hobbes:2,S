No.  The WWN stays the same and the SAN is re-configured to be
aware of the node migration.  Access patterns could be more
complex than just a single portal allowing access to/from the
SAN from/to the node.
WWN is supposed to be persistent.  This is what it actually is.
It is NOT supposed to be "(auto)generated" and/or changed at a whim.
This also has security implications, and enterprise networks may
refuse to use software (read "kernel") which allows for arbitrary
changes to a node's WWN.
If access to a node is compromised, a rogue agent may change
the node's WWN in order to access SAN zones that it normally
will be denied access to.
