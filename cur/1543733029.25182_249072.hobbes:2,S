Ok, but you need different low level drivers for those.  The TSC is not
stable enough as a long term time source, but it is best&fastest for
the offset calculation between timer interrupts.
Or you would need to make the single driver handle both TSC
and HPET/PIT, which would probably defeat the extensibility of
the new architecture. Even in that case you would need different
read() calls.

I am not talking about the interrupt source here, just from which
time source xtime is refreshed.

For reading only kernel & user could probably share, although
you may run into some interesting problems on architecturs
that use truly different "segments" for user and kernel space
(like sparc64 or m68k or possibly s390)

The kernel needs to write too. And at least on x86 there
is no way to make a page read only for user space and writable
for kernel space on the same mapping.

Sounds like a redundancy with the cputime type the s390 people did.
I don't think we should have two ADTs who do such similar things.
