Nice job. Thanks for doing this.

Yes. Note that it's an unsigned long, which doesn't work for ia32 
with PAE (just as a for instance). Using a pfn (page frame number) 
would be a better choice here, IMHO (see my definition of pfn below).
Same comment for zone_start_paddr.

Nice would be a strange term to use in this context - it's an ugly
hack ;-) It's the offset of the lmem_map array for that node within 
the global mem_map array, which doesn't really exist (I'm calling 
them arrays, though they're really just pointers - we use them like 
arrays though). mem_map is some arbitrary constant, set to point to 
PAGE_OFFSET or something similar.
> + zone_start_mapnr Address inside mem_map ?
Yes. Same comment as above ;-)
Note that there are two possible ways to define a pfn, in my mind.
One would be page_phys_addr >> PAGE_SHIFT. The other would be the
offset of the struct page for that page within the mythical mem_map
array. I prefer the former, though it probably contradicts everyone
else ;-) It's useful to have some way to pass around a 36 bit address
inside a 32 bit field.
