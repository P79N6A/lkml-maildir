If a task created resource remains then the beancounter remains until
the resources are destroyed, so it may exit well after the last task (eg
an object handed to another process with a different luid is stil
charged to us)

So that you can preserve the limits on the resource group ? That also
makes sense if you are trying to do long term resource management.
