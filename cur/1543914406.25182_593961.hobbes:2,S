because that is wrong and will give you a different issue (the other way
around actually) that the change to use compat_timeval actually tried to
fix. Your patch actually will allow to return arbitrary kernel memory in
case of 64-bit applications since data and len might not be initialized.
In case of 64-bit kernels you can have 64-bit or 32-bit applications. In
case of 32-bit application you have to return compat_timeval and in cas
of 64-bit application you have to return timeval. It is checked by
MSG_CMSG_COMPAT runtime flag and not the CONFIG_COMPAT compile option.

Marcel
