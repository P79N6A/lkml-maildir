folx,
i'm doing some data gathering in the linux network stack by means of a few
printk in the fragment reassembly and fragment dropping code.  the problem
is that ocassionally i'm getting what look like buffer overflows when the
pace of printk's is too fast.  i've looked through printk and just don't
understand it well enough to figure this out, so i was hoping for some
help.
is there any easy way to flush the printk buffers onto disk?
or, put another way,
is there any way to ensure that relatively high volume printk statements
get cleanly output to logs?
thanks very much for any help,
todd underwood
