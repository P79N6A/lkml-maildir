What do you mean is working ? Those patches are mainly one line
 fixes to the 2.6.x tree so most of the time there is not a 
difference between them and the 2.6.x kernel

They are making some people believe in word "stable" ;-)
It would be nice if they will be real stable (i.e. more fixes to
the kernel tree).

P.S. No, i don't use 2.6.x.y because i don't think a one line
patch will make the kernel more stable. Just my 2c ...
P.S.2. I just checked again www.kernel.org and saw that in the
newer
2.6.x.y  kernels there are some more changes. So i'll give them
a try to see the difference ;-). But i'm reserved ;-)
