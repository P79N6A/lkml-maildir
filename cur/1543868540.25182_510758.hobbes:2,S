This can't happen because when __do_irq unmasks the interrupt source,
the CPU mask is set, thereby preventing any further interrupt exceptions
being taken.  This is done precisely to prevent this situation happening.
If you are seeing recursion for the same interrupt (two or more stack
frames containing asm_do_IRQ for that very same IRQ) then your interrupt
handling is buggy, plain and simple.

I don't doubt that it is on the same IRQ line - I have such setups here
and it works perfectly - multiple 8250 UARTs connected to a single
level-triggered interrupt input which also happens to be shared with
a SCSI host chip as well.  Absolutely no problems.

I still say that your understanding is completely flawed.  Moreover,
you haven't read what I've said about the ordering of initialisation,
the stress on when we disable interrupts for the ports, etc.

You're actually *not* helping.  You're causing utter confusion through
misunderstanding, but it seems you're not open to the possibility that
your understanding is flawed.
I'm offering to look through your code and point you at the source of
your issue for free.  Please don't throw that offer away without first
considering that maybe I have a clue about what's going on here.

... which showed the port being opened well after system initialisation
of devices, including all serial ports - including disabling of their
interrupt source at the IER, has been completed.

Yes, and it's the same for any serial console with functioning break
support.  You'll find it in Documentation/sysrq.txt, though it does
misleadingly say "PC style standard serial ports only" whereas the
reality is "where possible".
