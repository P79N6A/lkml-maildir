I am willing to consider adding __devxxx only when other __devxxx
entries already exist.
These conversions to _devxxx are too late in the freeze, and only have
value for isolated cases --which you admit you don't even know exist--. 
Linus Rule 1: Don't overdesign.  Even if such cases do exist, and this
is a need, it should be addressed some other way.
Your suggestion bloats drivers needlessly for the majority of cases and
I will not be applying any such patches...
