Yes, Suspend2 if the user selects deflate as their compressor. The
output data will be PAGE_SIZE chunks, but deflate sometimes thinks it
has an extra byte to give us back.
I agree that it's ugly and don't recall using it when I had gzip support
in an earlier version of Suspend2. Are you thinking there might be a
better way? If so, I can dig out the old (non crypto api) code.
