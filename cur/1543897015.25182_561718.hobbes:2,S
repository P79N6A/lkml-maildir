Ok, that's a bit odd.

On the other hand, this one really does seem to be "nice".
I don't think it's a misfeature to be able to do "obvious compile-time 
constant optimizations" on initializer indexes. The bitfield size thing in 
some ways does do the same thing - it's clearly _odd_, but if I had my  
choice, I'd prefer a language that allows it over one that doesn't.

I agree that it's obviously not "valid C", but I don't agree that it's not 
remotely sane. Why not allow that extension?
