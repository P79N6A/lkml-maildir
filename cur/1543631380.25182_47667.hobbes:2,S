We are seeing some significant problems regarding ioctl() support in
this PDC patch on our 2.4.18 kernel.
Is there a newer patch available, if so, where can I find it?  can you
provide the
URL or attach it to a response.
I am sorry that we have not isolated it to the point of giving meaningful
error
messages, but we will work on that after we get the most recent patch.
