Further investigating this, I found the following posting:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2002/9/6/22
And indeed, even with 2.4.21, /proc/ide/ide2/hdf/settings shows that
'address' is 0, meaning that LBA48 is turned of, if I understand this
correctly. But that would mean that a 250GB hard disk should not work as
expected, right? May that explain my disk corruption problems?
