The complaint is valid, it should be advertised better, I had to look myself,
but I believe that
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/unitedlinux/1.0/src/kernel-source-2.4.19.SuSE-82.nosrc.rpm
 
is what you are looking for.
I've forwarded the request because I believe we can and should do better, but
I hope the complaint of a GPL violation has been settled ;-)
Sincerely,
