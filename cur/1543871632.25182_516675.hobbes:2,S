i'm not an xmon expert, but maybe it might make more sense to first 
disable preemption, then interrupts - otherwise you could be preempted 
right after having disabled these interrupts (and be scheduled to 
another CPU, etc.). What is the difference between local_irq_save() and 
the above 'disable interrupts' sequence? If it's not the same and 
xmon_core() relied on having hardirqs disabled then it might make sense 
to do a local_irq_save() there, instead of a preempt_disable().
