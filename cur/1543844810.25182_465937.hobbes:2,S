I don't think there's much value in patches such as this - if the
platform bus type didn't register, what happens when we then try
to register a platform device driver or a platform device?  ISTR
doing that before the bus type is registered leads to an OOPS.
So, presumably to do this properly, if the platform_bus_type failed
to register, you need to force all platform device/platform device
driver registrations to also fail.
At that point, is the added complexity really worth it?
