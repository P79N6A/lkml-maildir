Because IBM has a grand, secret plan to replace driverfs with 
BigBlueFS.  We have brainwashed Linus into taking it and we will rule 
the world!
No, I'm just being selfish and I'm a bit uninformed.  I understand it 
better now because Greg explained why you want to do it.  The thing 
that did it for me was Linus's decree that vm tunables _will_ move to 
driverfs.  That changes the scenario from "Greg and Patrick are 
bitching" to "Linus wants this" and thus it will be the wave of the 
future.   Maybe you guys need to make this a bit more clear.

I'm trying to understand, that's why I asked so many questions.  I am 
mistaken about the machine not booting completely if it doesn't 
understand a fs-type, Greg corrected me here.
Summary:
A driverfs version of this patch is on the way.
