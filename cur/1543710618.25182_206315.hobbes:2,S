On Debian's 2.4, I have been able to get 100 Mbps traffic by forcing a
re-negotiation through mii-diag or ethtool (I don't recall which one,
this mii-tool/mii-diag/ethtool is a HORRIBLE MESS that needs to be
sorted out) and seem to recall that ifconfig eth0 down ; ifconfig eth1
up could also have fixed this - however, such behaviour is of course
unsuitable for production use and I don't know if the same trick works
on 2.6 kernels.
