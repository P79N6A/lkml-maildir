Subject: PATCH: SYM-2 driver for Linux-2.5 (proposal)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
My proposal for inclusion of the SYM-2 driver in Linux 2.5 is available
from the following location (modulo mistakes :)):
ftp://ftp.tux.org/pub/roudier/drivers/linux/experimental/sym-2.1.11-linux-2.4.8-01.patch.gz
The patch is against kernel 2.4.8. It should also apply to 2.4.9 , but I
didn't give this latest kernel a try for the moment.
The proposal consists in the following:
- The current SYM53C8XX and NCR53C8XX drivers are left in place.
- The current SYM53C8XX driver name is now "SYM53C8XX Version 1".
- For historical reasons, the new driver name is "SYM53C8XX Version 2"
- The new driver files are added in linux/drivers/scsi/sym53c8xx_2/
- When linked statically, the 2 SYM53C8XX driver versions are mutually
  exclusives.
This proposal also applies to inclusion in either 2.4.X kernel or 2.2.X
kernel if this ever gets desirable.
Comments, reports and fixes are welcome.
Regards,
  Gérard.
