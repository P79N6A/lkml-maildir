Hi,
I tried to do a SIOGIFNAME ioctl() call on a (PF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW) socket.
I need to retrieve the interface name from the interface index returned
in the sll_ifindex field after a recvfrom() on the socket.  On my Intel
machine, it works perfectly.  On the sparc64, it fails with an Invalid
argument error.
Is this a known condition?  It's kernel 2.2.9 on a sparc64, stock Red Hat
6.0.
Hope someone can help.  Thanks.
Gerard
