stupid question: are you running 2.3 kernels and have you enabled High
Memory Support? I'm able to run 1.0 GB RSS processes:
  20   0 1000M 1.0G   232 R    1.0G 99.9 26.7   1:08 allocmem
1.5 GB ones:
  20   0 1500M 1.5G   232 R    1.5G 99.9 40.0   1:14 allocmem1.5g
2.0 GB ones:
  20   0 2000M 2.0G   232 R    2.0G 97.5 53.4   1:05 allocmem2.0g
.. just fine. With the current default virtual memory split of user-space
(3GB total virtual memory for user space - 1GB of that is shared
libraries, 2GB heap and stack) 2GB is the limit per process - this can be
upped to nearly 3GB by lowering processor.h's TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE to eg.
128 MB. This will give 2.9GB freely allocatable (mallocable) memory to a
single process.

it should work ... one way to debug such problems is to run the process
through gdb (or attach gdb to it while it's running), then when the
SIGSEGV arrives take a look at /proc/<pid>/maps, and you'll see which area
has overflown.

it should be ok for up to 2GB RSS in later 2.3 kernels.
