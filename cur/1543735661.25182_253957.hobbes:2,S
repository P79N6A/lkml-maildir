Driver calls bio_endio() with bytes_done < bio->bi_size, thus the bio
isn't completely ended. Drivers may do this for a variety of reasons.

On drivers that do partial completions :-)
You should not worry about where you'll see it. Either you handle
partial completions by taking bytes_done into account, or you ignore the
issue and just look at bio->bi_size to determine whether all io in this
bio has completed.

Well, you build a bio and submit it. If another bio is built after that
and is contig on disk (either before or after the other one), they are
clustered in the request structure if they don't violate the
restrictions of the hardware (max size of a single request, max number
segments, etc).

No, because { address, length } cannot fully describe all memory in any
given machine.

Any chunk of memory has a page associated with it, but it may not have a
kernel address mapping associated with it. So some identifier was needed
other than a virtual address, a page is as good as any so making one up
would be silly.
Once you understand this, it doesn't seem so odd. You need to pass in a
single page or sg table to map for dma anyways, the sg table holds page
pointers as well.

What kind of bogus example is that? Asking for a 4K write from a 4K page
but asking to start 1K in that page is just stupid and not even remotely
valid.

It's not difficult at all. Apparently you don't understand it so you
think it's difficult, that's only natural. But you have access to the
page mapping of any given piece of data always, or if you have the
virtual address only it's trivial to go to the { page, offset } mapping.

I can only imagine that you are used to a very different interface on
some other OS so you think it's difficult to use. Most of your
complaints seem to be based on false assumptions or because you don't
understand why certain design decisions were made.

I'll advise that you read and understand Suparnas excellent description
of bio in Documentation/block/biodoc.txt.
