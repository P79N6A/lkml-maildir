Agreed.  However, this work could easily be performed by an insmod
variant that takes a module, a "System.map", and a kernel image, and
produces a cpio file as output instead of passing the data to the
kernel for immediate processing.  The kernel mechanism would then only
need to unpack the pieces, relocate, and make the system calls.
