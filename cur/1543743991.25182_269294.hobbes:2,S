The root mount of the umounted tree is not detached yet, i.e. it has
mnt->mnt_parent != mnt and is detached in the else-branch, so that is
handled fine (at least my tests said so ;).
Only detached mounts and the namespace's root mount (that's the rootfs
mount IIRC) have mnt->mnt_parent==mnt. And we have two cases here:
a) already detached mount, this cannot happen. The only possibility to
get a detached mount into umount is the same we currently have with
mount, some process kept a reference and used a relative path. But
with the patch we would already bail out in check_mnt earlier in this
case.
b) root mount, is not detached so all mounts are still reachable
and can be unmounted as usual.
