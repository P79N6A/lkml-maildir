Looks like a manual re-implementation of a bug/request/patch tracker
like sourceforge's, bugzilla or whatever, with some additions. A patch
is added to the system, it gets a version tag, and you just pull it, and
mark it closed if applied to Linus' tree. If Linus releases a new tree,
the patch is marked stale until the maintainer uploads an updated patch
or just reopens it to mark "still applies unchanged to new version". (No
CVS involved, BTW.)

That's one of the arguments Peter Miller uses to endorse his "Aegis"
system: separate the integration part. FreeBSD also seem to follow a
similar idea: there are maintainers and committers. Maintainers usually
do not commit, but file PRs tagged as "maintainer-update".
(Note: I've never used aegis myself, it seems as though it had some
implications with development spread to various locations, someone
comment on that.)
Also, I'm not sure how good Bitkeeper fits here, or whether subversion
will help in this way (one might consider feeding suggestions to the
subversion team, 
http://subversion.tigris.org/,
 if they do atomic
commits, one might consider holding them off until blessed by an
integrator).
