I just noticed that at some point, struct pci_driver grew a .owner
member.  However, only a handful of drivers set it:
    $ grep -r -A10 pci_driver drivers/ | grep owner
    drivers/block/sx8.c-    .owner          = THIS_MODULE,
    drivers/ieee1394/pcilynx.c-     .owner =           THIS_MODULE,
    drivers/net/spider_net.c-       .owner          = THIS_MODULE,
    drivers/video/imsttfb.c-        .owner          = THIS_MODULE,
    drivers/video/kyro/fbdev.c-     .owner          = THIS_MODULE,
    drivers/video/tridentfb.c-      .owner  = THIS_MODULE,
Should all drivers be setting .owner = THIS_MODULE?  Is this a good
kernel janitors task?
