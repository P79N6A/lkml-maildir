Hi all,
Below path of kernel-2.6.8.1 for Motorola MPC5200.
This patch was based on MontaVista 2.4.21 kernel, and
included:
* Motorola BestComm API support
* little correction in Kconfig/Makefile to support it

Best regards,

 P.S. Sorry for bzipped tar, but patch is too big for send as plain
 text :(.
