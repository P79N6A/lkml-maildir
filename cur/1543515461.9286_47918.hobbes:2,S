e2fsck from e2fsprogs-1.17 _should_ be able to remove that file.  The bug

is now apparently known and Ted is working on a fix.
However, Ted, in looking through the e2fsck source I did notice a couple
of oddities: a regular device or socket inode with the correct zeroes in
the inode direct blocks but with the immutable flag set will _not_ be
touched by e2fsck.  We really do need a way to clear the immutable flag
on such inodes.

That sort of pte corruption usually (>99 times out of 100) means
hardware memory corruption.
