At this instance the function returns and no entry is seen in

But the code still fails; here's the code snippet tired...
struct device *new_device;
void callbackfn(const struct firmware *fw, void *context)
{
        printk("callbackfn: entry\n");
        if (!fw)
                printk("Got invalid fw entry \n");
        printk("callbackfn: exit\n");
}
static int __init dcdrbu_init(void)
{
        int rc = 0;
        
        init_packet_head();
        new_device = kmalloc(sizeof (struct device), GFP_KERNEL);
        if (!new_device) {
                printk("dcdrbu_init: kmalloc failed \n");
                return -ENOMEM;
        }
        device_initialize(new_device);
        strcpy(new_device->bus_id, "dell_rbu");
      
	  rc = request_firmware_nowait (THIS_MODULE,
                "install.log", new_device,
                NULL,
                callbackfn);
        if(rc) {
                printk(KERN_ERR
                        "dcdrbu_init:"
                        " request_firmware_nowait failed %d\n", error);
        }
     return rc;
}
In this case the fw pointer returned in the callback is NULL, it also
happens without any delay and I also see a message as below in
/var/log/messages.
hald[2888]: Timed out waiting for hotplug event 305. Rebasing to 306.
Thanks
