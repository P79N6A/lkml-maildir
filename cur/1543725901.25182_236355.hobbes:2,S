Here's a scenario: corrupt government agency secretly watermarks
incriminating documents. Brave whistleblower puts them on his laptop's
cryptoloop fs, but gets taken aside by customs agents on his way out
of the country. Agents check his disk for evidence of the watermark
and find enough evidence to assure that he's never seen again, without
even having to resort to rubber hose techniques.
Yes, the scenario is unlikely and I think it's _way_ overstating it to
call it an exploit. But it's still worth defending against. If we're
going to change disk formats, we should try to address it.
