I do not know. But the problem seems to be somewhat widespread - I just got
oops with the following trace:
 [<c0182f99>] sysfs_create_link+0x29/0x140
 [<c01ac578>] kobject_hotplug+0x58/0x60
 [<c0211490>] class_device_dev_link+0x30/0x40
 [<c02117ad>] class_device_add+0xed/0x130
 [<e185ffab>] usb_register_dev+0x12b/0x170 [usbcore]
 [<e1b2bf2a>] hiddev_connect+0x7a/0x120 [usbhid]
I think we should not oops, just complain loudly, when we come across a
kobject which has never beek kobject_add()ed, like in patch below.
