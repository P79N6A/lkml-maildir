I'm trying to get a firm answer from the folks who originally
discvoered the problem some time back, it seems you have two options:
 - during installation of RHEL4 (and not RHEL4U1), load with the
   'noprobe' option:
	linux noprobe
   and manually select the appropriate drivers to load.
 - (post installation) modify the /etc/modprobe.conf to and rename the
   qla2300 entry to qla2322 (i.e.):
	alias scsi_hostadapter1 qla2322
   modify the modules.pcimap table to load qla2322 for the 2322
   device-id:
	qla2300		0x00001077	0x00002322	...
   to:
	qla2322		0x00001077	0x00002322	...
Beyond that, I'd suggest you log a report with Redhat, as that's the
extent of the workaround knowledge without going to RHEL4U1.
Hope this helps,
Andrew Vasquez
