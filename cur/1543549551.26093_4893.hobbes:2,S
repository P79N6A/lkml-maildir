The progress() stuff works fine on 2.4. (I've not checked with 2.2.x lately). 
However, there's still a huge gap between the last progress() message and
availability of the frame buffer device. The simple console has the
advantage of outputing existing printk messages. (basically, it's a
console using prom_printf).
Well, I beleive I'll just get rid of this debug console to ease merging
of my pile of 2.2.x changes. It appeared that I never had a single crash
happen during this time, except when working on new HW, but then, I can
just add a prom_printf to printk() directly.
Ben.
