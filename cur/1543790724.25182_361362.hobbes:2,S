Yes. Three months would be too much. I considered even 2.6.14 to be 
delayed by at least one week. So 8 weeks is certainly better than it used 
to be, but I think 6 weeks should be the goal-post.
But to hit that, we'd might need to shrink the "merge window" from two 
weeks to just one, otherwise there's not enough time to calm down. With 
most of the real development happening during the previous calm-down 
stage, that might not be impossible: we'd only have one week for merges, 
but that isn't the week when development actually happens, so who cares?
Everything said, I think 2.6.13->14 worked well enough, even if it's hard 
to say how well a process works after one release. Considering that 2.6.13 
had the painful PCI changes (you may not have noticed too much, since they 
were x86 only) and there were some potentially painful SCSI changes in the 
.14 early merges, so it's not like 13->14 was an "easy" release - so the 
process certainly _seems_ to be workable.
So I'm planning on continuing with it unchanged for now. Two-week merge 
window until -rc1, and then another -rc kernel roughly every week until 
release. With the goal being 6 weeks, and 8 weeks being ok.
I don't think anybody has been really unhappy with this approach? Hmm?
