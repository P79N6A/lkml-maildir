it's especially hard if the people doing the testing need to find the latest 
patch and apply it.
even having a compile-time option to switch between them at least means that the 
testers can have confidence that the various patches haven't bitrotted.
boot time options would be even better, but I understand from previous 
discussions I've watched that this is performance critical enough that the 
overhead of this would throw off the results.
