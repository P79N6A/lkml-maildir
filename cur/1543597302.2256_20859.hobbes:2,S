It doesn't. If fs doesn't have link count you are very likely to need
other ways to deal with rename() anyway (e.g. you are pretty likely to
have part of metadata stored in directory entry). If you are playing
with "set i_nlink to 1 if it's too large" (which works only for directories,
BTW) - change according to your encoding scheme for link count.
