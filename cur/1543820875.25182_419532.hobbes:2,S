Subject: [GIT PATCH] Driver Core fixes for 2.6.17-rc3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/27/269

Here are some driver core fixes for 2.6.17-rc1.  They contain the
following changes:
	- documentation update
	- remove frame buffer sysfs file as it no longer works at all
	  due to sysfs core change (this is intentional, the file should
	  be a binary sysfs file not a text one.)
	- fix a build issue for DEBUGFS
	- fix a build issue for different CONFIG_HOTPLUG and CONFIG_NET
	  values.
	- remove some unused kobject exports.
All of these patches have been in the -mm tree for a number of weeks.
Please pull from:
	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-2.6.git/
or if master.kernel.org hasn't synced up yet:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-2.6.git/
Patches will be sent as a follow-on to this message to lkml for people
to see.
thanks,
greg k-h
