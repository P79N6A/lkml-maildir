Hello Mark!
I wrote Alan about it a while ago, and I got no response..
Do you maybe have an idea who made this change in the code ?
As far as I see, Alan is responsible for the video4linux thing, so maybe
it's him. I'll re-write him soon if I'll get no response..
btw, a weird thing.. In wmtv it works great.. but kwintv & xawtv makes
problems, and they're the more complicated programs, so It's a bug in the
kernel..
Cya,
Oren.
