It seems to be fine.  I can't really say that one is better than
the other.  Smoother interactive performance would be nice to see, but
the system was usable during the tests (about the same as 227a3 &
226a2.  Here are all the #s for the 50k tests:
test 1 - boot, login & run dbase on a file.
test 2 - boot, login, startx, run dbase on a file, bring up netscape,
         edit in emacs, etc.
dbase program builds a gdbm database.  See previous msgs for details.
                  Test 1 (noninteractive)              Test 2 (interactive)
