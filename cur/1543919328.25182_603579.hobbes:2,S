This is the pgdat->kswapd_wait waitqueue lock, by the looks?
It should be basically impossible to get this lock wrong, so
perhaps what happens is some memory corruption which is padded
(or some other random change) by spinlock debugging?
Is this very reproducable? Does your dmesg have any funny
messages after performing this heavy write load with
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK set?
