Ok, Wacom tablets needs the first one. But no harm appears to be done if the 
second one is skipped. What that means for other kinds of devices, I don't 
know.

Well, with only one X-server running I'd say it looks all right, but when I 
start two things starts to get strange. Don't know what happends really. But 
that was how I saw this, and...

...this is a bigger problem when apps need the data directly from the 
event?-device and not from the XInput-device.
A mail was sent to the linuxwacom list where a guy tried to use mouseemu to 
emulate the scroll button of a mouse with the stylus and a keyboard 
qualifier. Nice idea and I would probably use if it works, however since the 
X-server grabs the device no event will ever be sent so this could work. 
Pity.

Does safe in this case mean 'noone will be able to see what I'm typing', or is 
the reason the same as for the Wacom tablets?
Hmm.. What I'm asking is; Would there be a problem if grabbing only means that 
only that evdev-device will receive the input events, but all applications 
that has this device open will receive event whether or not if they have 
grabbed the device.

I wouldn't mind having a look on the patch. It would be nice to see other ways 
of how this little could be solved as I don't know what 'masking' in this 
case would mean. It's not a problem if I can't apply it to the latest 
source..
