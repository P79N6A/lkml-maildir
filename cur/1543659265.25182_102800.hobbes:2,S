Why does exceptions have anything to do with no-mmu?
There are exceptions that have nothing to do with MMU's, and a no-mmu 
architecture should still support them.  On x86, we have a number of such 
exceptions, for example general protection stuff for wrong values for 
special registers etc.
In other words, not applied. Page table exceptions are just the most 
_common_ exception type, but there's absolutely nothing in the mechanism 
that has anything at all to do with MMU-less.
If some archtiecture happens to have an empty exception table, that's 
fine.
