Why did you ignore the 'not static' comment, and why remove
the EXPORT? They're there for a reason...

Unless I'm missing something, you've just broken the hierarchical
relationship that exists between the local APIC device and its
client devices (NMI watchdog, oprofile [which you didn't convert],
and perfctr [not merged into Linus' tree]).
It's very important that the clients devices are suspended before
the local APIC is, and that the local APIC is resumed before the
clients are. I don't see how your rewrite can ensure this ordering.
