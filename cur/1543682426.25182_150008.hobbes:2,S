Hi 
 i had the same problem whith a MSI 6501 AMD MP 2000+!!!! and now it's worked!!!!
 I compile one kernel and when i start  mbmon (
http://www.nt.phys.kyushu-u.ac.jp/shimizu/download/download.html
 ) 
i saw 
Temp.= 32.0, 73.5, 65.5; Rot.= 2596, 4821, 2636
Vcore = 1.66, 2.54; Volt. = 3.34, 4.84, 12.40, -12.78, -5.00
it was amazing cause bios said ~40°C
 I compile a new kernel where i change options and now i haven't  got this
message and mbmon say :
Temp.= 32.0, 52.5, 46.5; Rot.= 2596, 4821, 2636
Vcore = 1.66, 2.54; Volt. = 3.34, 4.84, 12.40, -12.78, -5.00
Yours
