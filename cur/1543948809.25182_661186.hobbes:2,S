Really?  It too reloads the CPU timer only when posix_timer_event returns
nonzero, and otherwise expects do_schedule_next_timer to be called from
signal dequeuing and call posix_cpu_timer_schedule to do the reload.  I
must be missing something (having written the code I am easily deluded into
thinking I know what it's doing).
Thanks,
