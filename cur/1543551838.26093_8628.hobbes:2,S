Subject: why does "ip route flush cache" take two seconds to run?

I'm trying to swap an IP alias from one network card to another, and so
I'm flushing the route cache.  To measure how long this takes, I have
"route -C" running in one window with a timestamp (seconds and
microseconds) after each iteration.
I then issue the "ip route flush cache" command with a timestamp after
it in another window.  This returns right away.
However, from the time the command is issued until the cache is actually
cleared is two whole seconds.  I would have expected it to be
essentially instantaneous.
Does anyone know why this is taking so long and maybe how I could speed
it up?
Thanks,
Chris
