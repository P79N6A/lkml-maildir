If the VF allocation fails in the PCI layer, then the SR-IOV core will 
invokes the callback again to notify the PF driver with zero VF count. 
The PF driver does not have to concern about this even the PCI layer 
code fails (and actually it's very rare).
And I'm not sure why the PF driver wants to do further work *after* the 
VF is allocated. Does this mean PF driver have to set up some internal 
resources related to SR-IOV/VF? If yes, I suggest the PF driver do it 
before VF allocation. The design philosophy of SR-IOV/VF is that VF is 
treated as hot-plug device, which means it should be immediately usable 
by VF driver (e.g. VF driver is pre-loaded) after it appears in the PCI 
subsystem. If that is not the purpose, then PF driver should handle it 
not depending on the SR-IOV, right?
If you could elaborate your SR-IOV PF/VF h/w specific requirement, it 
would be help for me to answer this question :-)

This depends on user application, you know, which depends on the usage 
environment (i.e. native, KVM or Xen).

Yes, the PF driver can use pci_iov_unregister to disable SR-IOV in case 
the fatal error occurs. This function also sends notification to user 
level through 'uevent' so user application can aware the change.
