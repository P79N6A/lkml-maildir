On 64 bit platforms, these:
	some_pointer = (something *)some_u32;
	some_u32 = (u32)pointer;
will generate compile warnings concerning the differently-sized quantities
on the lhs and rhs.
The usual way of suppressing this is
	some_pointer = (something *)(unsigned long)some_u32;
	some_u32 = (unsigned long)pointer;
