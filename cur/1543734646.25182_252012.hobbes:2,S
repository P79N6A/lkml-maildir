Hi,
2.6.9-rc2 is throwing a lot of these errors on my system:
[ACPI Debug] String: Length 0x0F, "Entering RTMP()"
[ACPI Debug] String: Length 0x0F, "Entering TIN2()"
[ACPI Debug] String: Length 0x0F, "Existing RTMP()"
About 450 of these three lines repeated so far, seem to get one every 5
seconds or so. Box is an Athlon64 solo, let me know if you want more
info (and what).
