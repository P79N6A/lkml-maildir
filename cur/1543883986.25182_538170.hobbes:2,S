No, not so. That was a criticism levelled at a previous incarnation of
this code which has since been addressed - this is now a convienience
layer on top of platform device, as opposed to what it used to be - a
complete device class of its own.
It eliminates a _lot_ of code duplication for hh.org, where we have
multiple machines with multiple CPU types all sharing multiple SoC chips
which have varying subsets of decices in them (eg. the TMIO SoCs share
MMC blocks with the ASIC3 ones, w1 is shared in a few devices, etc.)

Which is exactly what this code does, but without requiring each and
every platform to rewrite the same glue code over and over.
