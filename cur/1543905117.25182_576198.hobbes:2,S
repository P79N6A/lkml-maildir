Sorry, things looked okay when I tested on my UML environment (Puppy 
Linux). Some xterms popped around (because I was using "con=xterm") and 
the system was usable, so it gave me no indication something was wrong.
I thought of adding an extra debugging option to warn us when a blocking 
  I/O operation is issued for a socket/fd, but UML-specific code is not 
consistent regarding glibc functions. That is, most of the time it calls 
os_*(), but sometimes it calls functions like recvfrom() directly. I'll 
grep the source code for such calls and send a patch to clean it up a bit.
There might still be such cases, I haven't tested all channel types yet.
