Great! Thanks for all the debugging help.

Hmmm... Checking for slabs used in powerpc arch code:
The pgtable cache is configured as
          pgtable_cache[i] = kmem_cache_create(name,
                                                     size, size,
                                                     SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN |
                                                     SLAB_MUST_HWCACHE_ALIGN,
                                                     zero_ctor,
                                                     NULL);
Hmmm.... aligned slabs at size and then we MUST_HWCACHE_ALIGN?? Two 
competing alignment requirements and a constructor. Constructor requires
the moving of the free pointer after the slab and thus increases the slab 
size.
Sigh. IF SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN is set then SLUB believes this to be the 
ultimate demand that overrides all other alignments and only aligns to the 
cacheline. Try the following fix:
SLUB: Treat SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN as a mininum and not as *the* alignment
If the specified alignment is higher than L1_CACHE_BYTES and
SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN is set then use the higher alignment.
