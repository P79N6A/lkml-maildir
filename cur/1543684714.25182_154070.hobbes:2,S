I thought about something like that but then for loading modules too - which
would allow for a modular boot but a lock afterwards.

Well, I fear the runtime overhead - as it is, I suspect this patch is
somewhat inflamatory anyhow ('tough luck you were hacked', 'you are fscked
anyhow').
However, the check would be in {,k}mem_open and in sys_init_module, which
are not heavily used functions.
I'll whip up a dynamic patch soonish - I'm unsure about the right location,
/proc/sys/ something?
Thanks.
