I'm not looking at creating a true realtime policy of any sort. Mine is more a 
dynamic policy change to an interactive state that is sustained, which gives 
no more capabilities to a normal user process than they can currently get on 
SCHED_NORMAL tasks. Audio will definitely get priority... along with any 
other interactive task, but not in a real time fashion. Basically they 
effectively get a nice -5 unless they do the wrong thing.
