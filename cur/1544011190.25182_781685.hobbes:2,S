James meant just do s/osid/secid/ for continuity across the kernel (we
are trying to make the main kernel a bit more LSM agnostic and sid is an
SELinux term).  The userspace exported part is actually a translated
string (I think we use ocontext= and scontext=).
There is no reason we couldn't do this in audit.  But, I don't think
it's worth changing this patch, as I think audit refers to it as sid in
other places.  Maybe I'll try to clean that up someday.  I at least
added it to my "someday" todo list.
