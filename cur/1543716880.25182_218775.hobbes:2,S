This doesn't even concern mem_map yet.  The userspace ppc64 hotplug
tools actually write into the "OpenFirmware" tree from userspace, after
a hotplug happens.  This is partly because all of the ppc64 hotplug
operations happen in userspace as it stands now.

Actually, I was thinking that we'd just allocate the kobjects, and note
the presence of the memory in the nonlinear phys_section table.  Then,
when we online it, we can decide where it's mapped, what zone to put it
in, and where to get the mem_map space from.  I think that approach
gives the best flexibility.
