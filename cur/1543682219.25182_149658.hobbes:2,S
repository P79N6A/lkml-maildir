Adeos m3 for Linux is available at
http://savannah.nongnu.org/download/adeos/releases/adeos-m3.tar.gz.
This third milestone provides support for the following platforms:
o 2.4.{19,20,21} and 2.6.0-test1 on x86 hardware (UP and SMP).
o 2.4.20-uc0 on ARM-nommu.
Quite a lot of work has taken place since m2 was released a year ago,
mostly aimed at improving stability and determinism in demanding
real-time environments.
People seeking "real world" use of Adeos should have a look at the
RTAI project:

Regards,
Philippe.
