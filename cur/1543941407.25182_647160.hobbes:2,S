This won't work as written -- for the ACPI code doesn't currently optimize
for the HIBERNATE && ! SUSPEND case, and so both code paths are under ACPI_SLEEP.
While some day there may be a justification to make that optimization,
this isn't the day, and this isn't the patch.
So Rafael and I talked about it and decided to go with the simpler
patch below -- which I'll push.
thanks,
