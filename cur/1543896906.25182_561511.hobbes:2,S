Hmm, this sounds scary. On a vanilla kernel (with debugging disabled),
this code will simply deadlock.
Do you have a test case? If you need more help, please contact the
netdev folks (netdev@vger.kernel.org).

Well, you won't see much more than you already debugged. You see the
place where the lock was taken and the call trace of the function in the
same way you have seen it with the BUG_ON().
