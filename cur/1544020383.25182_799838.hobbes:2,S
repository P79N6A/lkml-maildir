Wow, git bisect seems like a pretty powerful tool - I've never used it
before, but will try to look into it.
FWIW, I am able to suspend/resume *once* with
kernel-2.6.29-0.73.rc3.git2.fc11.i686, but on the second try, I am not
able to resume.
Same goes for kernel-2.6.29-0.74.rc3.git3.fc11.i686, ie. powerup ok,
suspend ok, resume ok, suspend again ok, resume not ok -> freeze (no
keyboard, black screen, no hdd action, hard reset needed).
I'll look into git and try to download and compile a couple of
kernels. I'll post back if I have any success.
Thanks,
MartinG
