Linux/NFS works very well with Filers.  I did a lot of throughput
testing at Netapp circa 2.2.10-12 with Gigabit Ethernet (AceNIC).  Why
would you need to put 1TB on a single mount point?
Filers are also blessed by Oracle and can take care of the volume
management and backup issues.  The principle advantage is avalibility
(balanced against cost of course).  If you do talk to Netapp, ask for
someone that has linux/Filer experience.
