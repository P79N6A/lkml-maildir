Ok :-)  But you also say more investigation is needed. Is this something
I can help with, as an owner of this hardware?
And is there an EDAC list which reports should go to or is lkml fine?
There is no MAINTAINERS entry or info in Documentation (in
2.6.14-rc4-mm1).
If not, is it useful if I make a website and collect reports?

I'd better configure EDAC :-)
