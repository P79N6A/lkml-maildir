Okay, I am fairly new to all this, so bear with me as I try to explain the
problem fully.  :)
First, my problem was centered around Mysql.  I had a problem of processes
spawning and spawning (sometimes over 100 of them at a time).  A simply
mysqld restart would solve the matter for most of the day, but the problem
always persisited.  One the people in the mysql list pointed me to check my
disk performance.  I came up with this:
