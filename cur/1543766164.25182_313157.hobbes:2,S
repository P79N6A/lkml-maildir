-Again, super  block structures are allocated by the kernel, but not freed. The
-file super-max  contains  the  maximum  number  of super block handlers, where
-super-nr shows the number of currently allocated ones.

-Every mounted file system needs a super block, so if you plan to mount lots of
-file systems, you may want to increase these numbers.
