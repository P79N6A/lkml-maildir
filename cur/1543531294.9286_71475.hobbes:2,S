The problem here is the point at which you find you've run out of memory
is not a point where you can back out safely. How would you do so
anyway? Example without overcommit:
main()
{
	syscall_just_this_process_overcommit(0);
	char *p = (char *) malloc(1048576);
	if(!p) {
		printf("Hey we ran out of memory!\n");
		return ENOMEM;
	}
	// this memory is guaranteed safe to acces
	for(int i=0; i<1048576; i++) *p++ = i;
	// some other stuff...
	free(p);
	return 0;
}
To handle SIGBUS's is completely impractical. You would have to change
the interrupted address to a bailout address. Example with overcommit:
void *bailout_addr = NULL;
void mysig() {
	if(bailout_addr)
		set_interrupted_address_somehow(bailout_addr);
}
main()
{
	char *p = (char *) malloc(1048576);
	if(!p) goto bailout;
	bailout_addr = bailout;
	signal(SIGBUS, mysig);
	for(int i=0; i<1048576; i++) *p++ = i;
	// etc...
	free(p);
	return 0;
 bailout:
	printf("Hey we ran out of memory!\n");
	return ENOMEM;
}
Ignore the fact printf can run out of memory - in one of the apps I've
written I have a special version which can't.
Would you not agree that a SIGBUS is a completely silly way of finding
out you didn't get your memory? Now imagine this in a threaded app.
I'm actually making a patch against 2.2.14 to test this out. I'll see
what happens.
