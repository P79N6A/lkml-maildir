reference to the c++'s father's interview
http://www.artima.com/intv/abstreffi.html
 fortran and c++ can  achive good performance for they can abstract in
higher level and  their compiler can think in higher level to avoid
the cache miss (like in the array vs vector )or to achive the "no
code" Optimization
The vfs using c to OOP but c compiler can't have the high level
Intelligence as the c++ or fortran's compiler to help at the high
level Optimization
one benchmark showed the c insert in the array will slow by speed of   1/17
Then ,what's the power of c OOP vs c++ with the compiler's
Intelligence in OOP?or maybe the c compiler have Outdated？
any input will be appreciated.
