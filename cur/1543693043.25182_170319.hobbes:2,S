You're right; I just tried your original patch with a real device driver
and it worked.

Yes it does....
(am about to look at and try your third patch out).
Comments of the first patch:
	vm_io = vma->vm_flags & VM_IO;
uses 'vma' before it has been established that vma is a
non-NULL pointer.  Perhaps we should go back to just using
(vma_flags &VM_IO) everywhere it is needed?
Also, conside changing
	
	while (!vm_io && !(map = follow_page(mm,start,write))) {
to
	if (!vm_io) {
	    while (!(map = ...))) {
		....
            }
            if (pages) {
		....
            }
        }
as it more clearly codes up the intended effect, rather than relying
on  side effects ('pages' happens to be NULL whenever VM_IO is set).
