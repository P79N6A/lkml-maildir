Subject: VM tests on 2.4.14 2.4.15-pre[12] and Athlon opt

Summary:	Athlon optimized kernel uses higher percentage of
		CPU (36% vs ~ 25%) and takes a little longer on memory 
		fill test.  Athlon kernel a little faster on mmap test.
Test:	Fill and write 80% of virtual memory with "mtest01 -w -p80"
	mmap, touch, msync, and munmap 500000 pages "mmap001 -m 500000"
	Listen to mp3 sampled at 128k. (usual test).
	Test with/without Athlon processor configuration.
There were no mp3blaster skips on the mmap001 tests.

A note from Alan Cox on lkml said 2.4.14 should handle buggy VIA 
chipsets.  My KT133A now runs without oops compiled as Athlon.  
(kernels <= 2.4.9 didn't on my IWill KK266 mobo).
The next two tests are athlon optimized.  To me, the biggest
revelation is the higher "Percent of CPU this job got" on the 
mtest01 runs.
