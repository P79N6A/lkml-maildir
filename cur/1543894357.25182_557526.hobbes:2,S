Why do you bother sending out emails that just show that you cannot read 
or understand?
I want not just the code *I* write to be freely available. I want the 
modifications that others release that are based on my code to be freely 
available too!
That's what the whole "tit-for-tat" thing was all about!
Doyou even understand what "tit-for-tat" means?
Should I use another phrase? Do you understand the phrase "Quid pro quo"? 
Which is another phrase I've used to explain this over the years.

You are living in some alternate world. The GPLv2 gives me exactly what I 
looked for.
Yes, people can do improvements in private, and by keeping them private 
they'll never need to release them to anybody else. Big deal. I don't 
care. By keeping them private, I never see the end result anyway, so they 
"don't exist" as far as I'm concerned.

Yeah. So stop bothering me then. Go cry on somebody elses shoulder. Just 
accept the fact that I'm a grown person, in full control of my faculties, 
and that I'm perfectly able to make my own judgements, and that I don't 
need to follow the FSF blindly.
And it doesn't even matter if you don't understand me. That is, as I've 
said, _your_ problem.  I've done my best to explain to you, but if you are 
so limited that you cannot understand that other people have other 
opinions than yours, there really is only so much I can do for you.
Go away.
