This was before running an ldconfig. After running, it still selects the wrong 
libraries, but doesnt crash anymore (hm?).

The thing is, that the same image, aside from the neccessary config changes 
(sda1->xvda1, xvc0->hvc0), recognizes the right libraries. So I dont see an 
obvious problem there.

(XEN) traps.c:1698:d16 Domain attempted WRMSR 0000008b from 00000056:00000000 
to 00000000:00000000.
(XEN) traps.c:1698:d17 Domain attempted WRMSR 00000404 from 00000000:00000001 
to ffffffff:ffffffff.
And some more of it. But why does a ldconfig, which doesnt change the 
libraries loaded, change that?
For all debug data of the crashes see above.

Ok, will do so in the next days and will CC you at that.
Btw, is there a roadmap how in-kernel Xen is planned to develop?
