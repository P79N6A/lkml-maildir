Hello,
    I am intercepting system calls in 2.4.28 kernel
for my project work. While I was looking for syscall
numbers for system calls related to semaphores like
semop,semget..the appropriate numbers were  missing in
the asm/unistd.h file. For other system calls like
sys_pipe numbers are present in the above file. What
should I do to intercept these system calls? Where
should I look for the related syscall numbers?
Thanks,
selva
