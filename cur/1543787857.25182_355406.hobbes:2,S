I believe the issue is that you can't properly control the alignment
to ensure that you don't inadvertantly dirty the cache lines
corresponding with the memory you're performing DMA to/from.
Eg, on ARM, if the memory you're DMAing to/from is just above the
next stack location which will be used when you call a sub-function,
you'll have just undone the effects of the DMA API.  Provided GCC
decided to arrange the stack that way.
Or maybe there's a local variable right next to the DMA region.
Same effect.
However, who knows how different gcc versions will lay out the
stack?  That's completely up to the compilers whims.
So, if you want portable code and don't want random failures,
avoid DMA to/from the stack.
