Like I said this would prevent userspace to know true capabilities of
the input device
in question. Probably simply adding separate key notify events (such
as KEY_BRIGHTNESSUP_NOTIFY) to EV_KEY instead of creating EV_NOTIFY is
not such a bad idea - this way we can fix keymap from userspace (if
needed) instead of needing to modify the krenel.
So, EV_KEY (and extending KEY_MAX to 1024) or EV_NOTIFY?
