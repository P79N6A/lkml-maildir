Subject: [PATCH 23/37] dvb: Updated documentation for FusionHDTV Lite cards
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/1/44

- Updated documentation for FusionHDTV Lite cards. We must differentiate
  the bt8xx based "Lite" cards from the cx2388x based "Gold" cards.
- Provide location of CARDLIST.bttv Documentation, rather than
  instructing users to look at bttv.h
- Include card decimal id numbers. These are valid for module arguments,
  and might be easier for some people to remember, rather than hex.

 In general you need to load the bttv driver, which will handle the gpio and
 i2c communication for us, plus the common dvb-bt8xx device driver.
