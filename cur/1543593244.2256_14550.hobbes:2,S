Hello,
I've sent the following to the Bind9-Users list. It appears that this is a
kernel-related bug and they suggested I post it here as well.
I'm running Linux 2.4.5 and Bind 9.1.2 on a PowerPC. The same error has
popped up under 2.4.3 as well.
Please CC me with any responses as I'm not yet subscribed to this list.
Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

I saw one other post in the Bind9 archives regarding the same error.

The only problem is that the original poster is running FreeBSD
3.3-RELEASE. My boxes are Power PCs running Linux 2.4.5 - sysctl reports
the above fix as an "unknown key."
Is there an equivalent fix for Linux?
