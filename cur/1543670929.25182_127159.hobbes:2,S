Well, even though I'm working on a solution to that, it still involves 
early userspace, just not the heavyweight "fake root" userspace that an 
initrd represents. This is what the initramfs technology in 2.5.X is 
for, so eventually (soon, hopefully) you'll be able to start md devices, 
LVM volume groups, etc. from early userspace and not have to have any 
autostart logic in the kernel nor will you have build and maintain an 
initrd separate from the kernel.
