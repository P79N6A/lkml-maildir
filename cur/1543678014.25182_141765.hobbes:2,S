That idea definitely needs some refinement.
Run test-starve.c, and try to login.  I'm not sure, but I don't think I've 
seen any task change more than one priority from what it started life 
at.  In test-starve's case, that's 16.  It's partner is at 16 as well, so 
it can't preempt (bad).  A dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null stays glued to 
21.  Repeated sh -c 'ps l $$'  bounces back and forth between 15 and 
21.  (maybe I should fly to Vegas.. when I try to login with test-starve 
running, I keep hitting 21:)
