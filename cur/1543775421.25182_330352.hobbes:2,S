Multiple algorithms can be compiled in at once, so this patch is wrong.
mp_alg is supplied by userspace:
        if (rta->rta_mp_alg) {
                mp_alg = *rta->rta_mp_alg;
                if (mp_alg < IP_MP_ALG_NONE ||
                    mp_alg > IP_MP_ALG_MAX)
                        goto err_inval;
        }
If it isn't set correctly its an iproute problem. Did you actually
experience any problems?
