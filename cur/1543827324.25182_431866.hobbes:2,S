Some of this is already in -mm, isn't it?
I'm wary of this kind of change from drive-by patchers now -- I had to
commit two fixes recently to remove __exit from functions which are
actually called in the error case from the init function.
For those exit-and-error functions, I think we actually want an
__initexit marker. In the built-in case, it can actually be discarded
with the init code. In the modular case, it needs to be kept.
