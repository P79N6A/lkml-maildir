Ah, now I understand. Anyway, the Makefile is not related to the problem.

I think I would modify the conditionals in drivers/char/synclink.c
- to assume that generic HDLC is not present if CONFIG_SYNCLINK=y
and CONFIG_HDLC=m. I would even put a user-visible comment in the
*config (like the one in generic HDLC menu if you have no X.25/LAPB).
I.e., I would probably change:
#ifdef CONFIG_HDLC_MODULE
#define CONFIG_HDLC 1
#endif
into something like:
#if defined(CONFIG_HDLC_MODULE) && defined(CONFIG_SYNCLINK_MODULE)
#define CONFIG_HDLC 1
#endif
plus that comment in Kconfig.
(Not sure if the other synclink*.c files are relevant and need similar
changes).
