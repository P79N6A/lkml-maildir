Some time before rmoser started HIS discussion on compressed swap, I 
started a discussion on the same topic.  Out of that discussion came 
mention of an existing project which did EXACTLY what I was proposing. 
 That made me happy.  For some reason rmoser wants to start from 
scratch.  He can do that if he wants.  I had only hoped that my earlier 
mention of it would spark interest in taking the existing implementation 
and adding it to the mainline kernel, after some incompatbilities were 
dealt with.  Unfortunately, I don't have the time to engage directly in 
that particular aspect the kernel development.
