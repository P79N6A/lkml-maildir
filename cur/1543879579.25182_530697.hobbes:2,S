Oleg so fare you patches  have been inspiring.  However..

Calling do_exit directly like that is not a hack, as it appears the preferred
way to exit is to call do_exit, or complete_and_exit.
While this does improve the scalability and remove a global variable.  It
also introduces a complex special case in the form of struct kthread.
It also doesn't solve the biggest problem with the current kthread interface
in that calling kthread_stop does not cause the code to break out of
interruptible sleeps.

Ouch.    You have a nasty race here.
If kthread runs before kernel_thread returns then setting
"create->result = ERR_PTR(pid);" could easily stomp 
"create->result = &self".
