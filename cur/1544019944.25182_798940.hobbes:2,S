I have never seen this happen with 2.6.28. Last kernel that works
without freeze is 2.6.29-rc1-00224. Next one which I compiled was
2.6.29-rc1-00534 and it did not work. I assumed PEBKAC. When the next
one I tried 2.6.29-rc2-00013 did the same so I sent a bug report.
I don't know does following have anything to do with issue but extra
information has never hurt anyone.
1. Kernels which has the problem print 'acpiphp_ibm: ibm_acpiphp_init:
acpi_walknamespace failed' before LUKS is started.
2. One out of three reboots fail because LUKS is unable to find partitions.
