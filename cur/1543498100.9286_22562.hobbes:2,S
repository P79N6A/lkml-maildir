And NFS is a 32bit dev_t encoding. so while we can go to 64bit, its
simply digging large holes and jumping down them. Nobody currently needs
more than a 32bit dev_t. 4096 different device types, some multiplexed
each with a million minors ?  I think we can scale past the IBM mainframes
just fine in 32bits.
64bits means we have to screw up the NFS client, we won't be able to do
NFS root for all devices and worse.
