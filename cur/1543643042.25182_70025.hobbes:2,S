Subject: 2.5.34 on Sony PictureBook fails to boot

	Attempting to boot 2.5.34 compiled with SMP on a Sony
PictureBook results in the computer being reset before the kernel
activates the console.  The same kernel runs fine on a desktop PC.
This seems to occur regardless of whether or not enable
CONFIG_X86_NUMA{,Q} and CONFIG_MULTIQUAD.  My efforts to track down
the problem have been with these options off.  CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM is
not set.
	By adding an infinite loop at various points in the initialization
process, I have determined that the reset occurs in this call chain:
init/main.c			start_kernel
arch/i386/kernel/setup.c	setup_arch
arch/i386/mm/init.c		paging_init
arch/i386/mm/init.c		zone_sizes_init
mm/page_alloc.c			free_area_init
mm/page_alloc.c			free_area_init_core
mm/bootmem.c			alloc_bootmem_node
mm/bootmem.c			__alloc_bootmem_core
	2.5.31 booted just fine on this computer, and I see that there
are some potentially related changes in .34, but I have not yet
verified that .32 and .33 work on this machine.
	I expect to investigate this problem further tonight if nobody
beats me to it.
