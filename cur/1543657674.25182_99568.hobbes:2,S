I'm not really the right person to be answering this.  For any transfer you 
set up (which encompasses all of the SCSI stuff bar target mode and AENs) you 
should have all the resources ready and waiting in the interrupt, and so never 
require an in_interrupt allocation.
However, for unsolicited transfer requests---the best example I can think of 
would be incoming network packets---it does make sense:  You allocate with 
GFP_ATOMIC, if the kernel can fulfil the request, fine; if not, you drop the 
packet on the floor.  Now, whether there's an unsolicited transfer that's 
going to require coherent memory, that I can't say.  It does seem to be 
possible, though.
