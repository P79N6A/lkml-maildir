Correct. Same applies to a second patch:
check-for-acpi-resource-conflicts-in-i2c-bus-drivers.patch
Both patches should be merged upstream at the same time.

Len already merged all the acpi bits for 2.6.25 as far as I can see, so
all that is missing now is these two patches:
check-for-acpi-resource-conflicts-in-hwmon-drivers.patch
check-for-acpi-resource-conflicts-in-i2c-bus-drivers.patch
Both have been in -mm for quite some time.
In the default mode (acpi_enforce_resources=lax) these patches simply
print warnings but still let the drivers load, so they are safe to
merge, and the sooner, the better. The idea is to get feedback on how
many systems out there have ACPI resource conflicts. Then we'll see how
we can address them (if at all.)
I don't remember anyone objecting to these patches, and anyway the
problem has been there for years and nobody took care, so if anyone
really isn't happy with the solution designed by Thomas, that person
will have to do the work and submit something better later. That
shouldn't delay the merge of what we have now.
Andrew, both patches are
Acked-by: Jean Delvare <khali@linux-fr.org>
and I am totally fine with you pushing them to Linus now. But of course
having Mark's ack would be good too.
Thanks,
