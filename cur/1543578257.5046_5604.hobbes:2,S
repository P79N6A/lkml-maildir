Subject: Patch: linux-2.4.0-pre1/arch/i386/i386_ksyms.c needs to export mmu_cr4_features
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

	linux-2.4.1-pre1/drivers/md/xor.c calls the macro XOR_TRY_TEMPLATES,
which is defined in include/asm-i386/xor.h to use HAVE_XMM, which is
defined in include/asm-i386/processor.h to reference mmu_cr4_features.
So, to support compilation of raid5 as a module, i386_ksyms.c needs
to export mmu_cr4_features.  I have attached the one line patch below.
	Let me also add that 2.4.1-pre1 so far has been really smooth
sailing.  The problems with 2.4.0 hanging on the Sony PictureBook PCG-C1VN
have somehow disappeared with this version, usb-uhci.c does not generate
a kernel oops on that hardware, and this minor addition to i386_ksyms.c
was the only change that I had to make to get a clean build.  Hooray!
