The kernel seems to handle lots of other quirks, I agree that this 
should not be the default behavior, but it certainly seems possible to 
catch this on the more common cases for which it is needed.
The boards which need it probably should be the exception, 2.6 kernels 
did without it for several years, and breaking hardware which worked up 
through 2.6.15 is probably not the best way to cope with new boards. I 
don't think ignoring the problem while waiting for nVidia is good 
policy, since it's a regression.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
