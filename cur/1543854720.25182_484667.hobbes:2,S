I'm not so keeen on putting sysfs everywhere; it's not free!
The notion of passing a device node makes some sense, except
that a lot of the places I'm used to seeing GPIO requests are
so early in the boot code that there _is_ no device node yet.
Let me think about that one a bit...

On your hardware, you could just read the hardware when setting
the gpio direction ... don't need an extra mask to catch that
class of error.

Right; I think I've had the OMAP analogue of gpio_request() turn
up errors only once (that code base was once a lot dirtier), but
some newish debug dump code worked a lot better with that.

Yes it is.  I suppose I shouldn't have assumed it would go into
that gpio.h header file, even though that's where it started out
on the at91 platform.  :)
