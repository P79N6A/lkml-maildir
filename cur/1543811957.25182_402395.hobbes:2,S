Aargh... I hit that and fixed it, but forgot to refresh before sending.
The only thing I didn't test was whether the boot options worked, and
I just did that -- 'enable_8254_timer' makes the clock run too fast as
expected.
And credit to Andi was implicit in the "port from x86_64" but it should
have been explicit.
