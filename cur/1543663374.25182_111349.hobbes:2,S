You also need IRQ stacks to get down to 4K. The wrong pattern of ten
different IRQ handlers using a mere 200 bytes each will eventually
happen and eventually kill you otherwise.

ide_unregister is a really stupid one. Its copying a struct mostly to
restore fields it shouldnt be restoring but should be setting in the 
allocator. I hadn't realised quite how bad it was. Added to the ide
shitlist
