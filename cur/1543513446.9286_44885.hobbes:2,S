While Bluetooth devices are not yet commercially 
available it might not be too early to work on working
support into Linux for them. 
1. The Bluetooth spec provides a manufacturer independent 
   messaging to the Bluetooth USB device (HCI). 
2. M$ has not announced support for Bluetooth and seems 
   to be unsupportive (or atleast unenthusiastic) about 
   it. Linux support could be a significant plus for 
   linux on PDA's and internet appliances. 
Initially PCMCIA and USB bluetooth devices are expected to be 
available. This will need kernel code through applications 
but it makes sense to start with the kernel. If there is enough 
interest (code contributors, reviewers with knowledge of kernel 
USB and networking code) and a software development plan is put 
together I believe getting support (hardware, web sites, etc) 
will be possible.
Please indicate interest by replying to me and I will try to 
get a discussion going among those who reply.
