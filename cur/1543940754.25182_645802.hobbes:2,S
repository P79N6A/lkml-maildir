For better or worse I picked async_tx to represent "asynchronous
transfers/transforms", not "transmit".  So there is no asymmetry as it
is used for operations in any direction, or multiple directions as is
the case with xor.  It is simply a gathering point for the common
functionality of descriptor-based offload-engines plus some extra
stuff to deal with creating arbitrary dependency chains.

Well, it has gone from 4 calls to 2 recently for the memcpy case.  The
only reason it is not 1 call is to support switching dependency chains
between channels i.e. performing some copies on one channel followed
by an xor an another.
