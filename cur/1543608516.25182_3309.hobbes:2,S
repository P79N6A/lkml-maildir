int get(result_t * result);
u32 a;
get(&a);
This will fail at compile time if result_t is 64 bits.
In C++ you could even do overloading where conversion is possible and
still have compile time errors when it's not possible.

I don't dislike one-value-files - please tell me how you get type information
