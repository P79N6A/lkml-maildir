The 3512 is not quite the same as the 3112. It is supported by
drivers/ata/sata_sil.c for the new SATA layer. If you want to use the old
IDE layer and you know there will be no hotplug etc then you'll also need
to port the other 3114, 3512 differences over including the FIS errata
workarounds from the libata SATA driver into the legacy one.
