I'm sure I'm missing something obvious here, but what if the html files
you have are mounted on a FAT16 filesystem?  Aren't they all going to be
listed as executable?  I suppose the argument of "NT serves html files
from a FAT filesystem 1.6% faster than Linux" isn't particularly
convincing, but I was just curious.
