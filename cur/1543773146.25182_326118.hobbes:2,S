Hi!
I would like to know why alpha seems to be the only
arch which has assembler code for some syscalls
(like the sys_getx* calls)
is the alpha gcc compiler so bad that it can not 
handle the task of dereferencing the task struct?
is it some kind of legacy code, which should have
been removed a long time ago, but just wasn't?
or is there a special reason for doing so?
details: arch/alpha/kernel/entry.S
TIA,
Herbert
