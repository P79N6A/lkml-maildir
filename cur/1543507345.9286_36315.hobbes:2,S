After a very long delay, caused by my being terminally busy at MIT, and
then changing jobs, I've finally gotten an update to the serial driver
which supports PCI patches.  It can be found at:
	
http://web.mit.edu/tytso/www/linux/serial-4.30.tar.gz
This driver supports for the Oxford Semiconductor 16C950 UART, and good
collection of PCI boards (basically everything for which people have
sent me patches, or for which I've been able to get my hands on the PCI
serial cards).  
I've tested this driver with ConnectTech, Sealevel, and GTek serial
boards, and it has support for the SPCom 200 and Keyspan boards as
well.  I haven't tested the latter since I don't have the boards,
though.
The sources are designed to work on either 2.2 or 2.3 kernels, and as
shipped it comes with a Makefile which allows you to compile the
serial driver as a stand-alone module outside the kernel tree.
Alternatively, it should be pretty obvious how to copy the relevant
source files (serial.c, serialP.h, serial_reg.h, serial.h, etc.) into
the right places into the kernel, which will build the new serial
driver as part of 2.2 or 2.3 kernel.
I'd like to send an update of this driver to Linus fairly soon for
inclusion into the 2.3 mainline, so please send me any comments you
might have.  In particular, if you have some other PCI serial boards
other than the ones supported by this driver, please send me the vendor,
device, subvendor, and subdevice id numbers, how the PCI board
interfaces to the system (mapped I/O memory, I/O ports) and what clock
is used to drive the UART (i.e., what base_baud setting is needed; some
drivers use a faster clock crystal which allows the port to run at
speeds greater than 115200 bps).
