It's the load address of the library, and it's basically not meant to be a
stable value. It will at least depend on the load order and size of the
libraries, and it may in fact be intentionally randomized each run as a
security measure against ret2libc type attacks (PaX, execshield, etc all do
this, as does prelink everytime it re-prelinks libraries). It's entirely
plausible for it to change from run to run, much less machine to machine.
