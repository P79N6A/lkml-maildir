mm...  looks like all Matthew's changes were in 2.6.23.  And 2.6.23 worked
OK, yes?
The only recent changes to drivers/scsi/advansys.c are 
commit b80ca4f7ee36c26d300c5a8f429e73372d153379

    [SCSI] replace sizeof sense_buffer with SCSI_SENSE_BUFFERSIZE
    This replaces sizeof sense_buffer with SCSI_SENSE_BUFFERSIZE in
