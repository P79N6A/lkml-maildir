I looked and notice there were actually only one.
Andrew picked it up but I have attached it here again.
Then I leave the decision to you.

Subject: [PATCH 25/27] pci: fix section mismatch warning in pci_scan_child_bus
Fix following warning:
WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x47bdb1): Section mismatch in reference from the function pci_scan_child_bus() to the function .devinit.text:pcibios_fixup_bus()
We had plenty of functions that could be annotated __devinit but
due to the former restriction that annotated symbols could not
be annotated they were not so.
So annotate these function and fix the references from the
pci/hotplug/* code to silence the resuting warnings.
