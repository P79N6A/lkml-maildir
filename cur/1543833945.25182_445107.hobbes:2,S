Interesting idea. I just looked at one of them out of curiosity, but I'm 
not sure it is valid. Either that or I have misunderstood the problem it 
is identifying?

This function is part of the tty_operations API, that would be a pretty 
broken interface if it provided the possibility of a NULL tty to work 
on. Additionally, all of the callers seem to do this:
	tty->driver->put_char(tty, c);
If tty is NULL here, we have larger problems at hand :)
I'm also unsure how this null dereference is related to line 1183.
