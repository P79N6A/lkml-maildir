If LILO can do it...
The starting block number does not change unless you delete and
recreate the swapfile.  It has the same requirement for location
stability as the kernel image and initrd for LILO.
So, a patched LILO could record the start of the swapfile when it is
run.  Note that you do this as usual when installing a kernel or when
installing a new swapfile.  There's no need to do it when suspending.
If you're booting with Grub or some other fs-aware bootloader, then
the bootloader can presumably find the start of the swapfile just like
it finds the kernel and initrd.
