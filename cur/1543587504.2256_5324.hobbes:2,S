It's a good idea if you have bison installed to have a /usr/bin/yacc
containing:
	#!/bin/sh -
	exec bison -y "$@"
I think there is a reasonably good expectation that the command "yacc"
should do what is expected, without needing any special hacks for
bison -- unless, of course, you're using bison special features.
