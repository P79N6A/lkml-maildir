Good idea, then udev could create /dev/blowtorch so some other program
can do ioctl(SCSI_STOP) (or just run cdrecord dev=6,6,6 -eject).
Besides, it is called HOTplug for a reason.
Seriously, though, isn't hotplug supposed to handle plugging and
unplugging of hardware, rather than any random events detected by the
kernel?
