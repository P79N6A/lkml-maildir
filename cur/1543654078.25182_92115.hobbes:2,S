Which does not sound quite right for me. FP should be omitted
only if function contains less than half dozen stack references,
otherwise not. It does not matter whether it is a leaf function or not.
OTOH, AFAIK frame pointers make debugging easier, development kernels
are better to be compiled with fp in every func.
