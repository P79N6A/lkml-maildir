Return -ENOENT? I am guessing. But please tell me what should do
userland software if it runs with locale set to something.iso-8859-2 and
finds 김 in the directory? That is the same problem. And for now ISO
8-bit encodings are far more popolar and usefull with contemporary tools
than UTF-8. That is why I think suggestion of a layer in the kernel that
would translate filenames form utf-8 stored on the media to e.g. latin2
used by tools is quite reasonable. Especially when there is more than
one encoding for a particular language (think Russian, Polish). Even
more, with such a facility transition would be much more greaceful since
you could have utf-8 filesystem and then you can worry about tools other
tools. The filesystem is already populated with UFT-8 names.

That's why IMHO FAT is quite enough for this purpose.
