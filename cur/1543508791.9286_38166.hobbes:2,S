pcmcia is initialized _after_ initcall()'s are done, so I suspect it
would not work. There's probably good reason: pcmcia_init() needs to
know what areas are allocated.

Integrating it was rather easy... I do not think much thinking is
required. And - bulkmem is already there, is it? ;-). I can not see
anything wrong with one_driver_at_a_time approach.
