Hmm, I think the nosuid thing is meant to prevent suid mounts being
introduced into a "suidless" namespace.  This doesn't apply to dev
mounts, which are quite safe in a suidless environment, as long as the
user is not able to create devices.  But that should be taken care of
by capability tests.
I'll update the description.
Thanks,
