Okay. That explains the inodes.

Hmm. When I did
insmod scsi_debug.o add_host=1 num_devs=4000
it used 8MB. 
But when I did
insmod scsi_debug.o add_host=4 num_devs=1000
it used 32 MB. So I assumed it is per host.
Before:
size-8192              8      8   8192    8    8    2 :    8    4 :      9      
12    10    2    0    0   37 :      3     12      7      0
After:
size-8192           4010   4010   8192 4010 4010    2 :    8    4 :   4010    
4014  4012    2    0    0   37 :   4006   4014   4011      0
Thanks,
Badari
