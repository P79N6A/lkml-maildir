Ok - it's been almost a week now. Time for a status update:
It seems that the theory that the proposed dcache patch is fixing an SMP
race which mostly affects XFS on NFS servers, is sound.
Further, it seems that the XFS patch that never went into the kernel and
really shouldn't be necessary, really isn't necessary. That the sole
problem with SMP+XFS+NFS is solved by the dcache patch (or by running a
UP kernel).
The "large" box is currently running a uniprocessor 2.6.8.1 with the XFS
patch (which didn't quite solve the problem on SMP). It has been rock
solid for seven days with load around 40 during the day.  It has been
months since this machine had such "high" uptimes.
The "small" box has been running an SMP 2.6.8.1 kernel with the dcache
patch (but *not* the XFS patch). This machine, too, has been rock solid.
The conclusion so far, seems to be that the old XFS patch is most likely
unnecessary (although this is not confirmed on the large box, but it
seems to have been the general consensus from the XFS people all along),
that no patches are necessary in the UP case of NFS+XFS file serving,
and that the dcache patch solves the real problem in the SMP case.
In the light of all this, I would like to suggest that the following
patch is included in mainline - it is the old patch from Neil Brown
(http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=108330112505555&w=2)
adapted by me for 2.6.8.1 (this patch was attached to a previous mail
from me in this thread as well):
