i can't see how is many cases it won't make things *worse* in many
cases, especially if you use hardware
it seems you will be evicting (potentially) useful cache-lines from
the CPU when using hardware scrubbing in many cases and when using the
CPU if the tuning isn't right just trashing the caches anyhow
I'd really like to see how it affects something like make -j<n> sorta
things (since gcc performance is something i personally care about
more than how well some contrived benchmark does)
