Ugh, the attributions are getting too deep. James Sutherland and Jesse
Pollard were having this conversation. If I got this wrong, or any
included text was written by someone else, I apologize...

No. Overcommit means, for example, all user programs have used 1 gigabyte
in total, but your machine only has 256 MB RAM and 512 MB swap. And
malloc() still doesn't fail.
This behavior is *GOOD*.
Lots of that gigabyte of "used" memory may be shared copy-on-write pages
(or malloc()'ed pages, etc.) that will never be written to, and therefore
never page-faulted. So these pages will always be absent, because even
though technically they are "used", nothing will ever actually use them.

I don't quite understand what you mean, but I'm pretty sure it's wrong
anyway. :-)

Uh, it has been for me...
