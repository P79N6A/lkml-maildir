not really, but as you know, "640K ought to be enough 
for anybody", so maybe future hardware developments will
make shared resources possible (with different kernels)

definitely! there are many, many, hosting providers
using exactly this technology to provide Virutal Private
Servers for their customers, of course, in production

well, the same users who do not want to use Bochs for
emulating a PC on a PC, when they can use UML for example,
because it's much faster and easier to use ...
aside from that, Linux-VServer for example, is not only 
designed to create complete virtual servers, it also 
works for service separation and increasing security for
many applications, like for example:
 - test environments (one guest per distro)
 - service separation (one service per 'container')
 - resource management and accounting

yes, the discussions are ongoing ... maybe to clarify the
situation for the folks not involved (projects in 
alphabetical order):
 FreeVPS (Free Virtual Private Server Solution):
 ===============================================
 [
http://www.freevps.com/
]
	not pushing for inclusion, early Linux-VServer
	spinoff, partially maintained but they seem to have
	other interrests lately
   Alex Lyashkov (FreeVPS kernel maintainer)
   [Positive Software Corporation 
http://www.freevps.com/
]
 BSD Jail LSM (Linux-Jails security module):
 ===========================================
 [
http://kerneltrap.org/node/3823
]
   Serge E. Hallyn (Patch/Module maintainer) [IBM]
	interested in some kind of mainline solution
   Dave Hansen (IBM Linux Technology Center)
	interested in virtualization for context/container
	migration
 Linux-VServer (community project, maintained):
 ==============================================
 [
http://linux-vserver.org/
]
   Jacques Gelinas (previous VServer maintainer)
	not pushing for inclusion
   Herbert Poetzl (Linux-VServer kernel maintainer) 
	not pushing for inclusion, but I want to make damn
	sure that there does not come bloat into the kernel
	and the mainline effords will be usable for 
	Linux-VServer and similar ...
   Sam Vilain (Refactoring Linux-VServer patches)
   [Catalyst 
http://catalyst.net.nz/
]
	trying hard to provide a simple/minimalistic version
	of Linux-VServer for mainline
   many others, not really pushing anything here :)
 OpenVZ (open project, maintained, subset of Virtuozzo(tm)):
 ===========================================================
 [
http://openvz.org/
]
   Kir Kolyshkin (OpenVZ maintainer):
   [SWsoft 
http://www.swsoft.com
 I gues?]
	maybe pushing for inclusion ...
   Kirill Korotaev (OpenVZ/Virtuozzo kernel developer?)
   [SWsoft 
http://www.swsoft.com
]
        heavily pushing for inclusion ...
   Alexey Kuznetsov (Chief Software Engineer)
   [SWsoft 
http://www.swsoft.com
]
	not pushing but supporting company interrests
 PID Virtualization (kernel branch for inclusion):
 =================================================
 
   Eric W. Biederman (branch developer/maintainer)
   [XMission 
http://xmission.com/
]
 Virtuozzo(tm) (Commercial solution form SWsoft):
 ================================================
 [
http://www.virtuozzo.com/
]
   not involved yet, except via OpenVZ 
   Stanislav Protassov (Director of Engineering)
   [SWsoft 
http://www.swsoft.com
]
 
A ton of IBM and VZ folks are not listed here, but I
guess you can figure who is who from the email addresses
there are also a bunch of folks from Columbia and
Princeton university interested and/or involved in
kernel level virtualization and context migration.
please extend this list where appropriate, I'm pretty
sure I forgot at least five important/involved persons
> important kernel developers who are not part of a virtualization
> effort? 
no idea, probably none for now ...
> Ie. is there any consensus about the future of these patches?  
what patches? what future?
