This is what lvm does now with the write_super_lockfs calls.  They work
well for a specific purpose.
At the end of the day snapshots mean different things to different
people and different workloads.  In lots of ways the lvm snapshots work
very well.
But, doing snapshots at the FS level gives you better performance and
more control.
