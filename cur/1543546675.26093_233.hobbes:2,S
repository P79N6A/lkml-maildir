I thought it failed in raid0.c?
If you look at the latest diff for 2.2.17pre, you see one change for
raid0.c.  It changes a %ul to a %li or something like that.  If you make
that one little change back before applying the RAID patch, it seems to
apply fine.  It may mean that the raid patch needs similar work, though.
