Hello Fred Jackson,
Once you wrote about "rebuiling kernel fails":
FJ> why can I build, but not re-build the 2.4.x kernels on my redhat7.1 
FJ> boxes?
Maybe because those are actually RedHat 7.0 boxes and you need to do
"make mrproper" every time you need to rebuild it...  Remember to save
your .config though - mrproper is cruel :)
