Subject: [patch 2.6.19-rc6 0/6] more rtc framework/driver updates

Here are more RTC framework updates, basically for the 2.6.20 queue:
 - /proc/driver/rtc update ... display the 'struct rtc_wkalrm' status
   bits more sensibly (though the EFI "irq pending" flag is nonsense
   with an OS running)
 - rtc-sa1100 update ... wasn't reporting "alarm enabled", and its
   extra procfs info duplicated information already found there
 - X86_PC updates ... create an rtc_cmos platform device when PNPACPI
   isn't available do make one through PNP.  (Non-PC platforms can do
   similar things if they have a "cmos" RTC.)
 - Export ACPI RTC extensions through platform_data to the PNP device
   or the platform device, as appropriate.
 - New "rtc-cmos" driver, for the RTC on most PCs.  For most folk this
   seems like it should be able to replace drivers/char/rtc.c ...
 - Newish "rtc-omap" driver, for the RTC on OMAP1 processors.  No point
   in having this just live in the OMAP tree.
Folk wanting to try "rtc-cmos" will likely be wanting to tweak their
/dev/rtc node to become a symlink to /dev/rtc0, at least until the
new version of util-linux comes out (with updated "hwclock" knowing
about the new RTC class devices).
