Hi Bernhard,
It does fix up my problem. I have modified your patch a bit. I think
new version is little more clear. What do you think?
Thanks
Vivek
o System crashes if booted with irqpoll command line option.
o Problem happens because Inside note_interrupt() we are accessing
  desc->action->flag without taking the desc->lock. While accessing it
  somebody goes ahead and unregisters the irq handler hence desc->action
  is NULL. By the time note_interrupt() checks it, it crashes.
o In my system it is irq 4 seriving to serial driver.
o Take the desc->lock before accessing desc->action->flag.
