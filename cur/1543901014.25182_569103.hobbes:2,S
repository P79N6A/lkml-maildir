kernel/mutex.c says about mutex_unlock():
  * This function must not be used in interrupt context.
However I have done some simple test cases that show
it works without complaint.  Now I understand that one
shouldn't do this for good reasons.  So is this a
good coding practice rule, but something that
could appear in sloppy or poorly designed code?
