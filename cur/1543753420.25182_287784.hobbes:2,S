An interesting hack if your sound cards interval timer is supported and
can interrupt at high enough resolution (currently ymfpci, emu10k1 and
some ISA cards) would be to use it as the system timer.  Who knows, it
might even be useful for games, music and AV stuff that clocks off the
sound card anyway.  It would probably be easy, ALSA has a very clean
timer API.
