I'd agree, except that the problem isn't in the bluetooth code.  And it
probably doesn't have anything in particular to do with the fact that this
is a bluetooth device; the TT code gets used with USB hubs only.  More
accurately, the code helps manage the TT embedded in a high-speed USB hub,
allowing the hub to communicate with a full- or low-speed USB device
plugged into it.
