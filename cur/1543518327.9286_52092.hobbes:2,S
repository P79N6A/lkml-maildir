No problem, that is a different keycode, therefore it will pass.  Only 
250 ms is ok.  It only applies _between the first and the second
identical scancode in a row_.  It doesn't affect anything else.
100 ms _does not help anybody_ because when a glitch occurs, it is not
single shot, but repetitive, and fast - therefore you will end up with
duplicates.

Of course this is covered, please have a look at the patch.

At the keycode level I cannot make the difference between key down and 
key up.  I rely on both keydowns and ups in my patch.  I tried with
various approaches, including keycodes - this is the best.

Access to keycode is only provided (elegantly) in keyboard.c, which is 
common to all architectures.
