   Currently XFree86 requires a kernel DRM loaded
 in order to have _any_ 3D acceleration.
   So the range of 3D accelerated cards boils down to those
 which have appropriate kernel code.
   That reminds myself that me having a Fire GL 1000pro which
 is a perfect 3d accelerator can only use inderect Mesa
 rendering capabilities, which is indeed sad.
