The "driver hardening" people hopefully have been scared away from Linux
so they never show their face around here again.  And if they do, no,
this is not what they want to do (what they need to do is get a clue...)
The fault logging people should also not use this, as this is for
notifying userspace that an event has happened.  And yes, "overheat" is
an example of a event that some people consider a "fault" :)
