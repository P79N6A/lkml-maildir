applied to #upstream-fixes, but it's a hack based on a misunderstanding.

You are getting misled by the function name.
ata_bmdma_post_internal_cmd() is the common ->post_internal_cmd() hook 
for BMDMA-like (SFF-like) controllers.  ->post_internal_cmd() hook will 
always be called, for all commands, when present.
For PIO-only controllers, simply delete the post_internal_cmd hook from 
that specific driver's ata_port_operations.  (assuming no other cleanup 
is needed)
For other SFF controllers, perhaps ata_bmdma_post_internal_cmd() should 
be revised to check the taskfile protocol (PIO, DMA, ...)?
I leave that up to your judgement, to figure out what's best.  I 
certainly AGREE that an unconditional ata_bmdma_stop() for all commands, 
for all taskfile protocols, sounds wrong.
