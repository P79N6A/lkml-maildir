I went back and found the messages corresponding to our previous
discussions:
http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/linux/linux-kernel/2003-23/1675.html
Looks like again I've confused the local APIC with the IO-APIC regarding
that blacklist entry.  However, I thought 440BX had a IO-APIC built-in
to the southbridge.  Again, that was proved to be wrong by examining the
integrator's guide:
ftp://download.intel.com/design/chipsets/designex/29063401.pdf
page 99 of the PDF says:
"An I/O APIC is required for a DP system and optional for a UP system."
So it looks like I've never had an I/O-APIC on this board at all, only a
local APIC, and this thread is thus a waste of time. :)
In any case, thanks for leading me to the right answer!
