You really do not need a page table to use it. What needs to be maintained 
is knowledge on both side about what pages are currently shared across 
RDMA. If the VM decides to reclaim a page then the notification is used to 
remove the remote entry. If the remote side then tries to access the page 
again then the page fault on the remote side will stall until the local 
page has been brought back. RDMA can proceed after both sides again agree 
on that page now being sharable.
