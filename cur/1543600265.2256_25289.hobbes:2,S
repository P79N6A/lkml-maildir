I've just woken up this morning to find my internet gateway machine only
responding to pings, and on giving it a keyboard & monitor, a load of
scsi0:0:1:0: Attempting to queue an ABORT message
scsi0:0:1:0: Cmd aborted from QINFIFO
aic7xxx_abort returns 8194
errors.
Is this a problem with the hard drive on ID 1 or a driver issue?  It's now
working fine after a restart (eventually it seems to have given up on ID 1
completely and it restarted cleanly [it boots off ID 0]).
I'm using kernel 2.4.7, the card is an Adaptec 2940UW (aic7xxx), the drive
on ID 1 a Seagate Barracuda 18LP.
Joe.
