------------------
From: Philipp Kohlbecher <xt28@gmx.de>
commit 0af40a4b1050c050e62eb1dc30b82d5ab22bf221 upstream.
Impact: widen the reach of the low-memory-protect DMI quirk
Phoenix BIOSes variously identify their vendor as "Phoenix Technologies,
LTD" or "Phoenix Technologies LTD" (without the comma.)
This patch makes the identification string in the bad_bios_dmi_table
more general (following a suggestion by Ingo Molnar), so that both
versions are handled.
Again, the patched file compiles cleanly and the patch has been tested
successfully on my machine.
