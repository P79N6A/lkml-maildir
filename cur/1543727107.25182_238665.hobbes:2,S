Subject: PATCH: cdrecord: avoiding scsi device numbering for ide devices
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

hi,
I've written a patch for cdrecord/cdrtools. I've sent it to Joerg Schilling
already, but got no answer so far. Probably he's on vaccation.
I'm sending this to LKML too, because I've read about some ... nebulosity
with respect to scsi device numbering as used by cdrtools.
To cut a long story short: the patch avoids cdrecord having to use the
"virtual" scsi device numbering in the form of "ATAPI:x.y.z" and allows
you to use the name of the device, e.g. /dev/hdc instead.
By removing the IDE to virtual scsi bus/host/lun mapping, a lot of confusion
can be avoided especially if you have a lot devices of this kind in one
system.
with kind regards,
Herbert "herp" Rosmanith
Version: cdrtools-2.01a34
Solution: when the device specified in dev= starts with "/dev/hd" and
          this device can be found in /proc/ide, then cdrecord (and all
          it's components, such as e.g. cdrdao) is forced to use the
          ATAPI driver.
The patch is really very short and works at least on our system.
with kind regards,
Herbert Rosmanith
