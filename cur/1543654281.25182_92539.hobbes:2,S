You may try that patch with a VIA boxen and I am quite sure you may experience 
a bug that none of your harddisks may be recognized and result in a 
panic();

I had the same Fix in WOLK some time ago and many users with VIA chipset 
complained that with the fix their mashine does not recognize any harddisks 
and after trying to recognize they had a panic();
Maybe it's working for you with some VIA chipsets but I removed that fix and 
after removal all users with VIA were happy. I've never heard of a FS 
corruption of them.
ciao, Marc
