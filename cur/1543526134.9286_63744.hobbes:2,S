I second the motion. I'd also like a way of probing to check. I don't
like having to rely on the word of the bloke at the markets I bought
it from.
[flashback two weeks ago]
Me:  "So it's definately UltraScsi, CardBus, 32 bits?" (APA-1450A)
Him: "Yeah, definately"
Me:  dd gives me 800 kiB/sec. Bollocks. Ah, well, it was cheap.
Having a WWW terminal at the markets to check the manufacturer's site
would be good...
