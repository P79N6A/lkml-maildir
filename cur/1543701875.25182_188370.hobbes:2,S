:march=pentium3 is the closest safe choice, at least
:until gcc implements P-M specific support.

Perhaps -mcpu=pentium3 -march=pentium4 would be a good compromise? From the
GCC 3.3 info pages:
`-mcpu=CPU-TYPE'
     Tune to CPU-TYPE everything applicable about the generated code,
     except for the ABI and the set of available instructions. [...]
     While picking a specific CPU-TYPE will schedule things
     appropriately for that particular chip, the compiler will not
     generate any code that does not run on the i386 without the
     `-march=CPU-TYPE' option being used. [...]
`-march=CPU-TYPE'
     Generate instructions for the machine type CPU-TYPE.  The choices
     for CPU-TYPE are the same as for `-mcpu'.  Moreover, specifying
     `-march=CPU-TYPE' implies `-mcpu=CPU-TYPE'.
