well I didn't say that caa....fd3 is the exact change which broke it,
just that it's related to 1) CFQ changes and 2) CFQ being the default

I have a Remote Serial Console via HP's integrated Lights-Out Java
Applet but am not sure how to enable serial console via kernel boot
params (will try to find out).
I will first try to find the 2.6.17-git* revision working before
bisecting it against -git11 or git12.
