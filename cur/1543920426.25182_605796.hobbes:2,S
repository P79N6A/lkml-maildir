So, I'd have to say it doesn't belong on the input layer AFAIK.
As I said, I am not against using the input layer for this, but currently
AFAIK it is not to be used for it.

But many do, and the less mud in the water, the better.

Perhaps.  But for that Dell case, there is already a proper notification
system in place as well: ACPI backlight events.  You might have to get
userspace to tell the ACPI video driver that it will handle the events
(something X.org already needs, anyway), but that's about it.
