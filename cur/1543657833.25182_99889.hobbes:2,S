Yes. There are two types of this circuitry:
1) Just-a-capacitor-on-mainboard. When the pin in question (CBLID) is
connected to ground via a capacitor on the mainboard, the attached
devices can detect the cable and the IDE driver can ask them.
2) GPIO pin on mainboard. One of the chipset's GPIO pins gets wired to
CBLID and then the chipset can see what cable is installed.
Unfortunately, the wiring is mainboard (not chipset) dependent, and thus
only the BIOS can know.
Anyway, mixing various types of devices and mainboards there are always
cases where you get incorrect results. For some reason the ATA people
couldn't get this ever right.
The second method is safer, and mostly works for chipsets where there is
a 'cable detect scratch register', where the BIOS writes the 80/40 pin
cable information. Modern chipsets (Intel, AMD) implement this. VIA
doesn't. There is no way for a driver to read the cable type on a VIA
mainboard - it can ask the drives (but they can lie if they're mixed
with older devices, and if there is no cap on the mainboard), and it can
guess from the settings the BIOS used to program the UDMA speeds.
Currently it does the later, because it works in 99% of cases - the BIOS
will only set the chipset to UDMA66+ if it sees the cable on the right
GPIO pins.

It can not. Very modern drives and chipsets can adapt the termination
and various aspects of signalling, but cannot measure whether the cable
is suitable for a certain speed or not. The only way to really know is
to try to do a transfer. Or two. Or a thousand.

See above. Also see the ATA specs, it's there.

Not really.

If you use ide0=ata66, the cable should be forced to 80pin. Also, it can
work if the cable is short and there is only one drive. Make sure it's
not bent too much, too.

Mostly. See the ATA spec.
