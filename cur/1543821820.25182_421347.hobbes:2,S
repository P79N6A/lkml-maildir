There's an erratum in NF4 parts affecting certain EHCI accesses to
memory addresses over the 2GB mark, and you might be seeing this.
Presumably you're running with the GART IOMMU?  If not, then turn
that on.  Maybe even turn on IOMMU_DEBUG.
Another experiment might be taking the PCI_VENDOR_ID_NVIDIA case
in drivers/usb/host/ehci-pci.c and adding a call to dma_set_mask()
in addition to the existing call.
