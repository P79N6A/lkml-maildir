If the user is using an MTU of only 1500 (and thus not using
jumbo frames) he may be being bitten by a bug that was recently
fixed by Herbert Xu that made us use order > 0 pages accidently.
His fix is below:

    [NET]: Fix SKB_WITH_OVERHEAD calculation
    
    The calculation in SKB_WITH_OVERHEAD is incorrect in that it can cause
    an overflow across a page boundary which is what it's meant to prevent.
    In particular, the header length (X) should not be lumped together with
    skb_shared_info.  The latter needs to be aligned properly while the header
    has no choice but to sit in front of wherever the payload is.
    
    Therefore the correct calculation is to take away the aligned size of
    skb_shared_info, and then subtract the header length.  The resulting
    quantity L satisfies the following inequality:
    
    	SKB_DATA_ALIGN(L + X) + sizeof(struct skb_shared_info) <= PAGE_SIZE
    
    This is the quantity used by alloc_skb to do the actual allocation.
