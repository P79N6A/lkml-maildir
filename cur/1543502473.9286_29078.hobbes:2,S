Good heavens.  It's had all those features for a very long time.  Even
IPv6 about as quickly as its specified.

If there are genuine bugs in Linux, Miami should be telling the TCP
implementation folks so that Linux _does_ get listed there explicitly.
Sure there might actually have been bugs in some kernel versions, which
people are still using.  Linux has lots of users on the net so even when
bugs are fixed, people still use the broken kernels.
Frankly all the major stacks have a long list of known bugs in some
revisions, and everyone has code to work around other people's bugs.
