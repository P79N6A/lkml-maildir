Would kernel hackers be amenable to having their trees auto-repacked, 
and linked via alternatives to Linus's linux-2.6.git?
Looking through kernel.org, we have a ton of repositories, however 
packed, that carrying their own copies of the linux-2.6.git repo.
Also, I wonder if "git push" will push only the non-linux-2.6.git 
objects, if both local and remote sides have the proper alternatives set up?
