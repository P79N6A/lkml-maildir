Hi,
 I am working on Suse9.0 x86_64 kernel (2.4.21-102)
In the /usr/sc/linux/ dir , I can see kdb directory
with some files.
In the /boot/config file, it seems KERNEL_DEBUG is
enabled.
In documentation , it is said that we can enable in on
boot setting kdb=on.
Unable to find /proc/sys/kernel/kdb.
Any one got kdb working with Suse 9.0.
thanks
vinod
