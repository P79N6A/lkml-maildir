IIRC, This is what happens with any P4 that sets the HT flag but only
has one logical CPU.  Completely within Intel specs.  I spent several
days struggling with this months ago when I thought that the 2.4GHz P4
I've got was HT capable.  Then I RTFM...
BTW, IIRC, the BIOS of my machine shows "Local APIC Support" instead of
"Hyperthreading Support" if the CPU installed isn't really HT capable.

The processor counter should find "logical processors present" is one
and ignore the hardware disabled 2nd logical CPU.

Better still, enable Local APIC but not SMP or HT when you build a
kernel.  That way, you get Local APIC support without SMP kernel.
