I'm not playing patch wars, Patrick actually has very similar patch in
his tree already -- test5-pm2 contains kernel/sys.c and
kernel/power/swsusp.c changes; it does not contain
include/linux/suspend.h changes -- I'm not sure if that's mistake or
if prototypes were moved to some better place, and it does not contain
kernel/power/main.c changes -- main.c is pretty much rewritten in
test5-pm2 AFAICS so those changes do not apply.

I hope to hear some comments from Patrick. He merged the code, but
does not seem to be pushing the changes. I'd like to have something at
least partly working in -test6.
