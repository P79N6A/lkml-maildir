There seems to be something wrong with 2.4.2 smp even without usb.
My abit bp6 freeze after a day or so.  I have gone back to
2.4.2pre3 and this seems better.  I have to run a few more days
to be sure though.
I don't use USB and no devices malfunction - the machine just freeze
in the middle of the night and don't respond to sysrq 
or pings.  Resetting shows
nothing in the logs.
