It just occurred to me that the simplest and best fix for the specific
problem you mention is for you to set the SA_ONESHOT flag when you
install the SIGSEGV handler.  That way, if you get another
segmentation violation while you are already in the SIGSEGV handler,
it will just dump core straight away.
