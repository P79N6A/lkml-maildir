I rebooted the box, but had to SYSRQ-S, SYSRQ-B, due to shutdown -r now
hanging up. On reboot, the init scripts froze after "starting atd", but
fortunately this was after sshd, so I ssh'd to the box several times,
and did your ps command before hanging it with dbench 3 (dbench 1 and 2
were successful again).  I have that ps output if you want it.  I could
NOT do that, or even ls, after the dbench 3 hang.  When I shutdown,
SYSRQ-S only partially synced (just one partition).

I'll try 2.5.35-bk3 (no other patches) without preempt shortly.
I'll report any failures, but no news is good news.

I'll try that if I get the time.  But I wasn't getting any dump info in
dmesg for those boots.

Yep, plain 2.5.35, then patched with 2.5.35-bk3, then with your patch
posted at 15:23.  Nothing else.
