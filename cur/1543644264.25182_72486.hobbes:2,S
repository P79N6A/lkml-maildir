Hi James,
Burton Samograd reported a .text.exit error at the final linking in
2.5.37. The problem is that tdfxfb_remove is __devexit but the pointer to
the function didn't use __devexit_p. The following patch fixes it:
--- linux-2.5.37/drivers/video/tdfxfb.c.old	2002-09-21 22:06:55.000000000 +0200
+++ linux-2.5.37/drivers/video/tdfxfb.c	2002-09-21 22:07:47.000000000 +0200
