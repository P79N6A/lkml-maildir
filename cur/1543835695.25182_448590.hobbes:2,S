Nope, I'm a quite happy ext3 user for quite divergent workloads.
Starting with storing loads of small files in a hugh number of
directories (mkfs -T news) over hugh numbers of files in few
directories (mkfs -O dir_index) to only a small number of really hugh
files (mkfs -T largefile4).
All that I still need to catch up with is 4TB sized files. But I guess
this is really an uncommon workload, but ISTR that somebody even works
on this.
