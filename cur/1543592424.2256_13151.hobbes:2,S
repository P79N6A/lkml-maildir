another possibility for a debugging mode for the kernel would be to hack
gcc to emit something like the following in the prologue of every function
(after the frame is allocated):
	movl %esp,%edx
	andl %edx,0x1fff
	cmpl %edx,sizeof(struct task)+512
	jbe stack_overflow
where stack_overflow is a no_return routine... the 512 is just some fudge
factor where if we get that low on the stack we probably want to know
about it (perhaps compile time tuneable).
