You have contradicted yourself.  "In S3 the memory is in memory and in
S4 the memory is on storage".  How does the memory get onto storage?  
The kexec'd hibernation kernel writes it there.  To do so it accesses a 
storage device.
Consequently the device handling _cannot_ be exactly the same in S3 and
S4.
