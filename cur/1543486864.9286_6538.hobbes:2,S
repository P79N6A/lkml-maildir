It has been my unfortunate experience that those motherboards have very very
shoddy quality control.. I've seen some with defective AGP ports, flakey memory
problems and just overall unstability.
I don't think I'd be blaming the CPU just yet.. do you have any other
motherboards you could try with your current setup?
