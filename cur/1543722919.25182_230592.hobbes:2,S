Ideas for improvement are always welcome -- they would best be discussed

The concepts behind quilt are all stolen from patch-scripts, so it has
the same usability problem that patch-scripts has: forgetting to add a
file to a patch before modifying it is painful. the ``quilt edit''
command helps somewhat. I do not have a good idea how to fix this in a
more satisfactory way.
Quilt is missing some of the features of patch-scripts: there are no
equivalents to export_patch, which renames exported patches so that the
filename sort order equals the order of the patches in the series file.
Neither is there a way to strip such sequencing prefixes when importing
patches. (I consider this obsolete.) There is nothing kernel specific,
and nothing specific to version control systems. Also there are no
equiovalents to patch-scripts's new-kernel, mv-patch, patch-bomb,
pstatus, rename-patch, tag-series, unitdiff.py commands.
On the other hand there are lots of small improvements, no more patch
control files (that list the files a patch touches in patch-scripts),
improved diffing and status inquiry functionality, patch dependency
analysis, support for RPM packages. And there is more documentation.
Things I'm currently considering include:
 - handling of meta-information such as one-line summary, author,
   description,
 - support for diffstat (re-add; we had this in older versions),
 - a patch-bomb equivalent.
All of the above things will potentially conflict with the goal of
keeping the whole thing as policy-free and generally useful as possible.

Same here.
