Subject: RAID1 on 2.5.27 - bug in close_sync?

Running on a linux 7.3 full distro, installed the 2.5.27 kernel.
It seems that, if the root filesystem is running on /dev/md0,
and a resync happens, there is a bug in drivers/md/raid1.c at
line 648:
    if (waitqueue_active(&conf->wait_resume)) BUG();
Needless to say, the BUG happens.  As a result, the md0
raid1 array is never marked clean.
Any ideas?
