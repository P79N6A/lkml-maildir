It's more complex, obviously.  More surprising.  It used to be the case that
arch/x86^4 files were xx86_64 and arch/i386 files were i386 and possibly
x86_64.  Now it's the case that arch/x86_64 files are x86_64 and maybe i386
and arch/i386 files are i386 and maybe x86_64.  Additional and quite
unnecessary complexity.
I mean, how often do x86_64 changes in your tree break i386?  Once every
3ish weeks would be my guess.  Often this will be because the person making
(and reviewing) the x86_64 change didn't know (or forgot) that the file is
also used by x86_64.

Doing something like that would reduce complexity, reduce surprise and
increase maintainability.  That's more than warm-and-fuzzies.
