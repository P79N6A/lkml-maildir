If tin's flags are correct I forgot to reply to this after testing
that.  In fact I did *not* observe the corruption when I booted from
the Promise, but I didn't have the same file (an XFree86 source
archive) that I was using previously.  I think I know which version it
was, and I'll see about retesting with that.  If that works I'll try to
recreate a kernel of the version I originally encountered this with and
try that.  Probably won't have time until the weekend, what with the
twins' birthday party this evening.
