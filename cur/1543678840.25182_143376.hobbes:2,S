I'm running with this patch on my dual-proc desktop right now.
I agree: with a make -j20 going, the mouse became non-responsive
for about 1 second at a time.  Renicing the X server to -20 greatly
improved the response of my desktop with this patch under load.
I could switch virtual desktops (blackbox), move the mouse to focus on
an aterm and type a command (and get a response back), and not wait
too long for evolution to repaint or open a piece of email.
I could tell that something was grinding away on my system, but it was
still tolerable.
