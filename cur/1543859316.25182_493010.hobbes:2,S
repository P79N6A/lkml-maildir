This was one of the reasons why I had to introduce
nfs_writepage_locked() for 2.6.20 (the other reason being readpage()).
The problem is that you can only protect against redirtying of the page
by holding the page lock across the call to unmap_mapping_range(), the
page writeout and the page removal.

Ack, I'll add one in. If PagePrivate() is set during the call to
try_to_release_page(), then the page should never be freeable.

Would you still be interested in seeing this done?
