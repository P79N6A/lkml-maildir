If nobody else knows about it, it's not too likely to get fixed.
Send bug reports to procps-feedback@lists.sf.net please.
Before you do: "certain characters" will need some explaining.

I just got the last bit, /proc/*/wchan usage on 2.5.xx kernels.
Oddly, I'm ahead right now. I have a vmstat that uses a fast O(1)

have a sysctl that handles the 2.5.xx VLAN interfaces.
