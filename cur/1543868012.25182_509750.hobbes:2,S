Yes, I think times have changed, with the increased popularity of MSI
and paravirtualized devices. A few points on your old proposal though:
- Doing it per architecture no longer sounds feasible, I think it would
  need to be done per subsystem so that the drivers can be adapted to
  a new interface, and most drivers are used across multiple architectures.
- struct irq sounds much more fitting than struct irq_desc
- creating new irq_foo() functions to replace foo_irq() also sounds right.
- I don't see the point in splitting request_irq into irq_request and
  irq_register.
- doing subsystem specific abstractions ideally allows the drivers to
  not even need to worry about the irq pointer, significantly simplifying
  the interface for register/unregister.
