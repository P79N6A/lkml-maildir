Subject: [2.3.99-pre1]: spinlock.h conflicts
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

DRI compiled correctly in every previous version.
It seems both spinlock.h can be included, because
linux/include/linux/spinlock.h has these lines:
#ifdef __SMP__
#include <asm/spinlock.h>
#else /* !SMP */
[...]
But my box isn't SMP, and I haven't configured linux to compile with SMP
support. I haven't investigated much so the problem can be elsewhere.
