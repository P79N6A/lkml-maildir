Most of us don't really care about the details of the whole min/max thing
(my only real care is that it should've been called anything other than
min or max, typed_min perhaps, but that's a secondary issue, more relevant
to forwards compatibility of 2.4/2.2/2.0 hybrid drivers).  What we do care
about is the fact that a release was done without a prepatch to look over
to give people a chance to fix any resulting breakage.
