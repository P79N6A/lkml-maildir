So as not to break userspace we must still support old values, at the same 
time we want new programs to start using the new correct values - hence 
the introduction of _backward compatibility_ values.
> (old)	#define MATROXFB_SET_OUTPUT_MODE

the old was bad since it was sizeof(sizeof(...)) - it so happens that by 
def sizeof(anything) is a size_t - thus replacing sizeof(sizeof(..)) with 
sizeof(size_t) changes nothing - just shortens the code...
Of course what we probably should really have is the above (now) code 
defined as "BAD" and the previous (old) define without the sizeof as the 
current (no BAD prefix).

Precisely - unfortunately due to coding errors (the erroneous double 
sizeof invocation) this isn't the way it is - and for backwards 
compatibility it can't be broken... sad, really...

Yap, both violate.  It is a mess and there is no easy fix due to the need
to retain the old invalid ioctl's as well... and the real 'tough' mess is
on platforms where due to type sizes both the OLD and the NEW defines
result in the same IOCTL define value... that'll probably screw over
switch statements (I'm not sure - but I think you can't have the same
value twice in a case statement).  If this happens on all platforms than 
the conversion OLD==BAD to NEW can be done quietly - otherwise... we've 
got hell.
