Hi,
If binfmt_elf is a module then register_binfmt() called from
init_elf_binfmt does the job. But if it is not a module how is elf_format
linked to formats?
I grepped for it and couldn't find it. The formats is initialized to NULL
so it can't be done the way it is done for default_exec_domain (i.e.
initializaing a variable instead of calling register_exec_domain()). And
elf_formats is static to binfmt_elf.c so I am a bit lost...
Regards,
Tigran.
