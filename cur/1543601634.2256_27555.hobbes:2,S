No.
Note how it is a _heuristic_ only. The "safe" answer is always to say "the
page is in use", and note that once the page_count has dropped to 2 or
less, it won't increase unless somebody else has a swap count..
And we check for the "somebody else has a swap count" two lines lower.
(And the swap count is stable at 1 while the page is locked, because
nobody can increase the swap count without locking the page and dropping
it from their VM).
Do you see anything wrong with that logic?
