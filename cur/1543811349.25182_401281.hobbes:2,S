Really, this is a gcc bug.  My version of the compiler:
gcc version 4.0.3 20051201 (prerelease) (Debian 4.0.2-5)
Doesn't give this warning.  And, since the loop has fixed parameters,
gcc should see not only that it's always executed, but that it could be
unrolled.
Which version is causing the problem?
