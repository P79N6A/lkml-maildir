Peter, 
Would it be an idea to invite people to lower the voltage on their 
CPUs a bit, to try and trigger #MF's?
(I started thinking about slowly overclocking the CPUs, to try and
trigger them, but that's not neccesary. At lower voltages, you'll also
get errors, but shouldn't risk smoking your CPU.... )
