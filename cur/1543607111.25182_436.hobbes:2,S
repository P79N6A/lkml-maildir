When talking about why Americans don't go out and magically change
things, this is the key. When talking about who is harmed most by
injustices, the theme of the poorest is true anywhere. Just a point when
criticizing Americans, contrary to popular opinion, not starving is not
the same as having power or influence. When someone without money
complains, it is called "whining"; when someone with money complains, it
is called "free market".
