I don't know if this issue has already been addressed on the list, as I
just subscribed, but it didn't appear in the archives so:
In kernel 2.3.13, the framebuffer's video_setup() is not being called,
preventing any command-line parameters for video= from being processed
before the driver's initialization function is called.  We all know what
kind of problems that can cause :)  Here's a quick patch, which I am
sure has already been included in the 2.3.14, but I'm including it JIC.
