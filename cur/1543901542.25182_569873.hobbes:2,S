That is the very short version of the story, yes: some
PowerPC implementations are VIPT physically, but there
are no aliasing issues we have to worry about.
Anyone interested in how this works, can download the
PPC970 UM (or 970FX or 970MP); it has a very detailed
explanation of all this.  Cell might be slightly different
but the base idea is the same.
