You complained that changes which break your system[1] shouldn't be added 
and now rudely demand your desired changes which have been shown to break 
others' should be added immediately. I don't believe I misunderstood you 
or got the wrong context - it has nothing to do with the related patch.

You're worse than that reiser4 fanatic, at least he wasn't rude when he 
repeated himself over and over and over. I was going to offer to help 
you bisect between -git1 and -git2 (it'd be trivial to run the bisect 
here and provide patches to test) but I won't bother if you're going to 
hijack every email with your abuse.
