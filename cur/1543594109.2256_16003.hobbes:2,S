Never got that far.  My problem was actually tcp_syn_retries. Remember, I was 
talking to a host that was unplugged.  (I wasn't even getting "host 
unreachable" messages, the packets were just disappearing.)  The default 
timeout in that case is rediculous do to the exponentially increasing delays 
between retries.  10 retries wound up being something like 20 minutes.
I set it to 5 and everything works beautifully now.  ssh (which retries the 
connection 4 times, and used to take over an hour to time out) now takes just 
over 3 minutes, which I can live with.
