On AMD cpus starting at least with the K7 it is a cpu function.  They
have both memory access and IO access FSB cycles.  The cpu decodes the
address by looking at the IORRS and TOP_MEM (IO range registers are
similar to mtrrs but for specifying IO regions).  
Of course there are some northbridges that don't ignore the mem/io
bits..

So far I have only seen this on the intel E7500 and it's descendants.

Having the memory disappear entirely is much more common.

At least not until you plug in a card with a 256M pci memory region
and loose half a gig of RAM.
There is also the trick of just not mapping the RAM into the address
space in a contiguous fashion.  I have been very tempted lately to
just setup boxes with one dimm below 4G and have all of the rest above
to make this easier.  But 32bit OS's and the performance hit
they take when accesses memory above 4G to make this a good idea yet.
