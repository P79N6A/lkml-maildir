Thanks, Bryan.  I was about to write almost the same.

I guess, you can mount Versionfs (yet another stackable file system)
below RAIF and above one of the lower file systems or use some other
versioning file system such as ext3cow.  This will allow rolling back to
any older file system version at any time.
