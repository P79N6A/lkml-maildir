Is 2.2.12 ok?
Could you try disabling your _running_ config by steps 
and test each so as to constrain the probl?
  Eg:
   1. If you have cbq setup:
        tc qdisc del dev eth0 root
        tc qdisc del dev eth1 root
   2. Flush forward  rules (if any) and stop forwarding
        ipchains -F forward
	echo "0" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
   3. Disable other "special" netw stuff may have
Please let us know

Juanjo
