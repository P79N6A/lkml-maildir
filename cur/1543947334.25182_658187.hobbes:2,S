I find the following patch to make saved stack traces so much easier to
decipher. There might be other uses of save_stack_trace() that I am not
aware of, though. Also, I suggest changing the underlying struct
stack_trace to include the reliable/unreliable information. This, however,
requires all users of save_stack_trace() and all arches saving this
information to change.
Kind regards,
Vegard Nossum

Subject: [PATCH] x86: don't save unreliable stack trace entries
Currently, there is no way for print_stack_trace() to determine whether a
given stack trace entry was deemed reliable or not, simply because
save_stack_trace() does not record this information. (Perhaps needless to
say, this makes the saved stack traces A LOT harder to read, and probably
with no other benefits, since debugging features that use
save_stack_trace() most likely also require frame pointers, etc.)
This patch reverts to the old behaviour of only recording the reliable trace
entries for saved stack traces.
