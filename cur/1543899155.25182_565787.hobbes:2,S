If we are willing to expect the update in the same patch then we can
emit a failure if the presented string in __check isn't in the update to
the documentation.  I guess emit it as a CHECK in case they have loads
of them and a separate documentation patch.
CHECK: __setup appears un-documented -- check

#131: FILE: arch/i386/kernel/mfgpt.c:233:
+__setup("mfgpt_irq=", mfgpt_setup);
