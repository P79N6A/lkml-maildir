Hello,
I am contemplating a patch which would move the drivers/sn/ioc4.c code
into drivers/misc, as the SGI IOC4 device may soon not be limited to
operation on the SGI SN2 platform.  However, to maintain proper Kconfig
dependency ordering, this will require me to move drivers/misc before
drivers/ide in the drivers/Kconfig file.
My examination of this change seems to indicate this should not cause
any problems for the drivers hosted under drivers/misc, however I wanted
to run it by those who have recently (i.e. since "git" began hosting
the Linux source) touched the drivers/misc/Kconfig file.
Do any of you anticipate a problem with the following change?
Thanks,
Brent
