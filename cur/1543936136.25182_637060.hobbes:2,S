Since you are looking for comments, I'll mention a loop-related behavior 
I've been seeing and see if it gets comments or is useful, since it can 
be used to tickle bad behavior on demand.
I have an 6GB sparse file, which I mount with cryptoloop and populate as 
an ext3 filesystem (more later on why). I then copy ~5.8GB of data to 
the filesystem, which is unmounted to be burnt to a DVD. Before it's 
burned the "dvdisaster" application is used to add some ECC information 
to the end, and make an image which fits on a DVD-DL. Media will be 
burned and distributed to multiple locations.
The problem:
When copying with rsync, the copy runs at ~25MB/s for a while, then 
falls into a pattern of bursts of 25MB/s followed by 10-15 sec of iowait 
with no disk activity. So I tried doing the copy by cpio
   find . -depth | cpio -pdm /mnt/loop
which shows exactly the same behavior. Then, for no good reason I tried
   find . -depth | cpio -pBdm /mnt/loop
and the copy ran at 25MB/s for the whole data set.
I was able to see similar results with a pure loop mount, I only mention 
the crypto for accuracy. Because many of these have been shipped over 
the last two years and new loop code would only be useful in this case 
if it were compatible so old data sets could be read.
