I'm running linux-2.3.26 here.
I have a M$ Intellimouse USB mouse.
It works great, apart from the wheel (but thats to be expected).
I don't see the problems you describe.
I use gpm.
My X server is connected to /dev/gpmdata.
Here is the relevant part from XF86Config:
	Section "Pointer"
	    Device      "/dev/gpmdata"
	    Protocol    "MouseSystems"
I run gpm as follows:
	gpm -3 -m /dev/usb/mouse0 -t imps2 -R msc
Regards,
Toon.
