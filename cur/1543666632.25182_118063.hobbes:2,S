	There are really only two conclusions you can draw from this:
	1) This only applies to a situation where the primary purpose of the 
original publication is for the purposes of selling the item to 
produce revenue and therefore it's reasonable to judge the copyright 
violation on the basis of its affect on the sales of the original 
work, or
	2) You can violate copyright for commercial purposes so long as you 
don't cost the original publisher anything. In which case, any GPL 
violation is acceptable, since there's no "market" for a free work.
