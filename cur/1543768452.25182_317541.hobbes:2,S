stupid question : have you tried reverting to older versions to check
if the problem follows kernel upgrades or if something is ageing badly
in your machine ?

do you mean that you tested both with tulip and realtek and that the
problem happens with both of them, or that your machine needs those
two NICs simultaneously ? Using a realtek with heavy NFS and network
traffic seems somewhat odd, eventhough the driver is rather stable.

I don't know. I suspect that it might delay the problem but not remove
it.
