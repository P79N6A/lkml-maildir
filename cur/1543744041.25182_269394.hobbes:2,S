I don't like it neither. It lacks barriers. the rivafb driver
notoriously lacks barriers, except in a few places where it was so bad
that it actually broke all the time, where we added some. This
originates from the X "nv" driver written by Mark Vojkovich who didn't
want to hear about barriers for perfs reasons I think.
