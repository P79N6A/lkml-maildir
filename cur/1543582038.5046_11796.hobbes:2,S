Agreed. But these are the only relevant quotes I could come up with. And
to me, these quotes make the ptep_get_and_clear() assumption look risky
at best ... even though they do not give clear answers either way.

No. All architectures do not have this problem. For example, if the
Linux "dirty" (not the pte dirty) bit is managed by software, a fault
will actually be taken when processor 2 tries to do the write. The fault
is solely to make sure that the Linux "dirty" bit can be tracked. As long
as the fault handler grabs the right locks before updating the Linux "dirty"
bit, things should be okay. This is the case with mips, for example.
The problem with x86 is that we depend on automatic x86 dirty bit
update to manage the Linux "dirty" bit (they are the same!). So appropriate
locks are not grabbed.
