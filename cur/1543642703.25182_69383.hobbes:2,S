That's odd because every box that I have looked at has the
0.0.0.0:PORTNUM in the netstat list if there is a service listening on a
particular port.  
I know most programs will allow one to specify on which interface to
listen, but it doesn't look as if syslogd has such an option.
As an additional piece of information, I've tried tweaking xinetd.conf,
but those messages are still being logged into /var/log/messages.
Thanks for your help,
Andy.

I think that all these 0.0.0.0 addresses are handled just like
broadcast addresses, i.e., your driver will get interrupted for
every packet on the wire. If so, this is not good and will severely
affect the performance of your computer. I think you need a real
"network(ed)" address for these, i.e., 10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2, etc.
In the "olden" days, 0.0.0.0 was the broadcast address and I think
that Linux still maintains that compatibility.
