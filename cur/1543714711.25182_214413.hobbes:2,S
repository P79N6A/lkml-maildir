Subject: [CHECKER][COVERITY] Announcing Coverity's Linux bugs database
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

As a service to the Linux community, Coverity is providing an online 
database of hundreds of bugs in the Linux kernel at:
http://linuxbugs.coverity.com
These bugs were found by Coverity's static code analysis tool, which was 
based on our research on Metacompilation at Stanford University 
(previously known as the "Stanford Checker").  These bugs were found 
without running the code or writing any test cases.
Free registration is required to access the database.
The Linuxbugs database is read-only for the general public.  If you want 
write-access in order to change the status of bugs or add comments, 
please contact linux@coverity.com with the email address(es) you wish to 
add write access to.
We would love to hear your feedback at linux@coverity.com.  Learn more
