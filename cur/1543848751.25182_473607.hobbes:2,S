Yes, this solves the problem in most cases.  Lock patching is fine no 
matter when you do it.  I think the problem with alternative patching in 
check_bugs() is that it happens way too late; the patching really has 
nothing at all to do with check_bugs(), and should be a separate step, 
probably part of setup_arch.
The paravirt-ops stuff also has some patching code.  Fortunately, there, 
we can probably skirt the NMI issue by simply disallowing NMIs, but the 
issue pops up again in stop_machine_run - what happens if you take NMIs 
during stop_machine_run?  Debug traps?  Module unload is fine, but code 
patching done using stop_machine_run is not safe.
