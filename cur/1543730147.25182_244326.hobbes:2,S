Subject: [PATCH] Split timer resources
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The kernel currently allocates the range 0x40-0x5f for timer calls. This 
causes conflicts with other hardware using these ports (In my case a 
Winbond W83L519D SD/MMC card reader). This patch splits the resource 
into the ports actually needed.
