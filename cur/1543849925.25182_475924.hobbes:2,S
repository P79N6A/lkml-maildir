This would appear to be inode table corruption.

This is bitmap corruption.

Hmm, this would appear to be a buglet in error handling.  If the block just
allocated above is in the system zone it should be marked in-use in the
bitmap but otherwise ignored.  We definitely should NOT be freeing it on
error.
Yikes!  It seems a patch I submitted to 2.4 that fixed the behaviour
of ext3_new_block() so that if we detect this block shouldn't be
allocated it is skipped instead of corrupting the filesystem if it
is running with errors=continue...
It looks like ext3_free_blocks() needs a similar fix - i.e. report an
error and don't actually free those blocks.

I would suggest that you give this a try on RAID5, just for starters.
I'm not aware of any problems in the existing ext3 code for anything
below 8TB.
Cheers, Andreas
