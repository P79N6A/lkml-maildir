I haven't committed to linux1394-2.6.git, hence I prefer to post an
update rather than incremental patch.

BTW, if I get sign-offs/ acks/ test feedback on a patch before another
patch update (but not before committing the final version to the
upstream submission branch), I add those sign-offs etc. like this
    S-o-b: Someone
    S-o-b: Me (modified whitespace or something else trivial)
or this
    Initial changelog
    S-o-b: Someone
    Changelog post scriptum
    S-o-b: Me
provided that the update only marginally changes the patch or can be
clearly distinguished from the formerly signed off parts.  Of course if
I get sign-offs etc. on the final version of the patch
