No, it does not work like that. You don't get nice, reviewable,
mergeable patches by developing code independently for 3 years or so
then attempting merge.
If devicescape code is better than mainline, merge it _now_. If it is
not, drop it and start from mainline code.

That's okay; as long as incremental way exist, first version not being
compatible with last version is not a problem.
