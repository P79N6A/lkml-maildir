I don't want to use rdinit, because there is no task for rdinit(3), and I 
don't want to mount a filesystem(3). But I do want to use init(2).
I have to lie to the kernel saying (2) is (1) in order to trick it into
beleaving I'd do (3) myself, which I don't, just in order to not do (3).
If the bug of not calling the security hook would be fixed, this trick
would use the path where rdinit is expected to trigger the callback, but
since that rdinit would be no rdinit, that callback would still be wrongly
skipped. That would not be a bad thing for my setup, but it clearly shows
this setup to be wrong.
The correct solution is tell the kernel not to do (3) if you don't want 
it to do (3). The rest will work as intended.
