Hi
I'm fighting a problem with my (new) Acer laptop.  (Aspire 9303)
In 2.6.18 the audio worked fine, but now I've upgraded to 2.6.22
it has stopped working. 
I note that there is a acer specific quirk mode in patch_realtek.c
enabled for all acer devices introduced in the timeframe. Disabling
the quirk so that the driver uses it auot mode makes playback work
fine again.
To be clear this pathc seems to work for me:-

Unfortunately I think it's pretty clear it will break for others.
