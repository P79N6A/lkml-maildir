It is a bigger problem for targets submitting io becuase the underlying 
device's queue could hit nr_requests.

You do not have to create a work_struct for every read. Why not just 
have a bio-successful-reads-queue and a workstruct per device? That way 
you can at least have num cpu devices running in parallel.
