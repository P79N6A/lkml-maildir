I think this is wrong, and far too narrow in useful scope to be merged.  
It's unnecessary bloat of task_struct and if this is really a problem, then 
there is a [performance] bug in the slab allocator.  Please at least provide 
the slab statistics for what is going on, as the workload might well be 
thrashing the creation and destruction of slabs, which would be a much better 
thing to fix.
