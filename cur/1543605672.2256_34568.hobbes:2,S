Hallo Dan,
thnaks for the pointer and your remarks, but I really
wondered if linux _never_ immediatly accept()'s connections.
I never saw a connect() call returning 0 (connected) on a
non-blocking socket. Always EINPROGRESS. I guess I have to
look at the kernel to see scheduling effects ...
thanks,
Patrick
