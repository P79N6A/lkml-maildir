actually with a design proposal I did today, I think for x86-64 we'll be
able to reach something of the order of 1msec/100usec of precision in
nanosleep without the need of RT privilegies (note this has nothing to
do with the nanosleep patch in -aa, the nanosleep patch is about the
retval, not about "how time will pass"). However the whole timer
handling will have to be revisited by the time we start to code this.
