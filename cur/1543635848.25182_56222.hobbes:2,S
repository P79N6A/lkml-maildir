Well, one way would be to scan for them directly, i.e.:
    for i in /dev/hd* ; do 
	ioctl(fd, HDIO_GET_IDENTITY, &ident);
	if (!(ident.config & 0x4000) && ((ident.config & 0x1f00) >> 8)==5) {
	    /* Got an ATAPI cdrom drive */
	}
    for i in /dev/scd* ; do
	open ($i, O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK)) < 0) {
	    /* Got a SCSI cdrom drive */
	}
  
Of course making user space do this is pretty lame.  But we
have a much better way.  Each cdrom device registers with the
uniform cdrom driver, which can easily assign each registered
cdrom device a major and minor.  That scanning for cdroms would
be as simple as
    for i in /dev/cdrom* ; do
	open ($i, O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK)) < 0) {
	    /* Found a cdrom drive */
	}
