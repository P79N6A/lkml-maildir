Oh, indeed, this kind of a construct also fails for ia64 on existing gcc-s.

That is very unfortunate, but is then a good reason to fold the
'const' into the __devinitconst definition as I originally suggested (and
perhaps that's the reason why I didn't have problems with my version
of the patch on ia64) - that way, those architectures that can't tolerate
it could have __devinitconst continue to resolve to __devinitdata,
resulting in traditional section allocation, while targets like x86 can still
benefit from the constification.
Apart from that we may want to approach the gcc folks to allow a way
to override this 'optimization for the kernel (or more generally for
statically linked executables).
