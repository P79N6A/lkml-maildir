The arch independant code now has the concept of being able
to allocate from multiple pools of memory, in preferential
order.
This could be very useful for other things than just the
x86 bigmem support. Just think of 32-bits PCI dma, or of
NUMA machines where different parts of memory have a
different access cost to them...
