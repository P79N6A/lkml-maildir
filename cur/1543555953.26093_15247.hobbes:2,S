Subject: VFS: brelse message in syslog, its due to ReiserFS or kernel  failure ?

Machine: P3 500 on ASUS P2B, WD 15GB IDE drive.
System RH7 with upgraded glibc.
When I'm using 2.2.17 with ReiserFS:
Nov 26 00:05:05 localhost kernel: Linux version 2.2.17 (root@localhost.localdomain) (gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 relea
se)) #9 Sat Nov 25 17:09:40 CET 2000
I have such messages in syslog and console:
Nov 26 06:00:49 localhost kernel: VFS: brelse: Trying to free free buffer
Nov 26 06:07:41 localhost kernel: VFS: brelse: Trying to free free buffer
Nov 26 06:32:28 localhost kernel: VFS: brelse: Trying to free free buffer
FS size is about 8GB.
When I've switched to 2.4.0-test11 + ReiserFS patch there are no such messages.
Both kerlels are patched with latest ReiserFS patches.
