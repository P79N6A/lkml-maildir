Subject: [PATCH 3/3] sched: fix signedness warnings in sched.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Unsigned long values are always assigned to switch_count,
make it unsigned long.
kernel/sched.c:3897:15: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different signedness)
kernel/sched.c:3897:15:    expected long *switch_count
kernel/sched.c:3897:15:    got unsigned long *<noident>
kernel/sched.c:3921:16: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different signedness)
kernel/sched.c:3921:16:    expected long *switch_count
kernel/sched.c:3921:16:    got unsigned long *<noident>
