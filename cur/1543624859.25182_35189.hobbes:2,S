loop isn't implement via ->request_fn anymore. Loop since 2.4 is only
driven by the ->make_request_fn, that for the other more normal devices
just means the old legacy __make_request. request_fn is subject to the
rules pointed out by Alessandro, but ->make_request_fn can sleep just
like ll_rw_block can sleep.  ->make_request_fn and in turn
loop_make_request can only run in normal context with irq enabled and
they're both allowed to sleep just like ll_rw_block and submit_bh.
Nevertheless as Jens said the infinite-loop-allocation in the
->make_request_fn path are deadlock prone at the moment, not because
they sleeps but because they need a reserved mempool to guarantee
operations can go ahead slowly without deadlocks even if dynamic
allocation fails, but this is not a very pratical problem, it's very
unlikely to deadlock there (it's not worse than the other infinite loop
in getblk() that affects not just loop).
