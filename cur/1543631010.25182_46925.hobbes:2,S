:) I was surprised it worked with the missing spin_unlock too. Im
testing the fixed diff now, so far it looks good.

We used to see bad behaviour. It turned out to be the per cpu
timer interrupt firing at exactly the same time on all cpus. One
cpu would successfully spin_trylock and the others would fail
and postpone the work.
We now evenly space the per cpu interrupts. Does intel do the same?

I tested ppc64 and it worked fine.
