Not exactly "broken". More like "unmaintained". It works for some peoples but
there are LOTS of problems with it :-/ And noone bother to fix them since
there are exist version 0.90 :-)

1. If you are lucky and have working RAID based on stock 2.2.x (for example
RAID 0 :-) you should be able to upgrade to 2.2.14 without big hassle.
So upgrade to RAID 0.90 in mainstream kernel posponed to 2.4 ...
2. RAID 0.90 need some changes in some important kernel structures and such
changes will affect even users without RAID.
RedHat 6.1 includes RAID patches anyway so I'm not sure if 2. still can be
considered seriously.

AFAIK you do not need to backup data and reinstall it (I can be wrong here).
You should install new RAID tools and accomodate configuration files but
actual contents of RAID array do not need to be reinstalled.

RAID amateurs will use RedHat 6.1 with patched kernel :-)
