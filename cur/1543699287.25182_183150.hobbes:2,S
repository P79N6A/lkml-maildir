Very simple.
Apply the basics of GPL and strip all the inlines to a file called
kernel_inlines.[ch] and export all the symbols to export_symbol.
Thus all the cute tricks people try to taint the unprotecable interface is
removed.  The basics of removing the code in question.
If you holler wait you are changing the core and you can't BUZZIT.
I can change what ever I want and distribute it where ever I care.
Thank you,
