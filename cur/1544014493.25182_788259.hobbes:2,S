I checked the datasheet and also tried every possible SMBus command
value to try to discover any supported commands that the i2c-nforce2
driver happens not to use, to no avail. The nVidia SMBus is pure
SMBus.
I could change the ds1307 driver to check whether the controller
supports i2c block commands and fall back to emulation only if they
are not available. Would that address your concerns?
