The way was_dirty is used here seems confusing and hard to read; there
are completely separate code paths for dirty and non-dirty, lockable and
already-locked buffers, with all the paths interleaved to share a few
common bits of locking.  It would be far more readable with any sharable
locking code simply removed to a separate function (such as we already
have for inverted_lock(), for example), and the different dirty/clean
logic laid out separately.  Otherwise the code is littered with

and it's not obvious at any point just what locks are held.
Having said that, it looks like it should work --- it just took more
effort than it should have to check!
