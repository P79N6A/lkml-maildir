Hi guys,
I have a new patch:
    
ftp://ftp.shout.net/pub/users/mec/kbuild/patch-2.2.0-pre9-mec1
Features:
    - new Documentation/kbuild/ directory
    - fix ugly invocation of split-include (run it at start of vmlinux)
    - shrink label for 'Old CD-ROM drivers' so xconfig fits 800x600 screen
    - fix "Frame Buffer Support" button location in arch/m68k/config.in
    - Update maintainer address in scripts/Configure; you don't have to
      send your bug reports to microsoft.com anymore!  (Ironically,
      this code is the cleanest, least troublesome code in the
      configuration system).
    - Improve the exit message for 'make config', 'make menuconfig',
      'make xconfig'.  The user has to run 'make dep' only if the
      dependency files don't exist or if CONFIG_MODVERSIONS is set
      (Jeff Ronne).
    - Shut vfix the hell up ('WARNING - broken Config.in!').
    - Fix menuconfig bug in lxdialog with very long titles.
    - Remove the BUG_COMPATIBLE code from xconfig.  Among other things,
      this fixes the "what is CONFIG_PEANUT_BUTTER doing in MenuChocolate"
      bug with nested submenus.
If you run this patch, let me know how it works for you.  Old bugs,
new bugs, "it works for me".
