just use
	return nonseekable_open(inode, filp);
as your last statement in cmx_open() instead of
	return 0;
to really disable any file pointer positioning (e.g. pwrite/pread too).
Addtionally cmx_llseek() is implement already as "no_llseek()"
by the VFS, so you delete it from the driver an use no_llseek() from
the VFS instead.
