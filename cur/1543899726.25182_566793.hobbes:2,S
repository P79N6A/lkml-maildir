They waste space.  It makes the code harder to read.

It's not a big deal either way, but that's a pretty weak reason for
doing it that way.  Can you actually demonstrate a performance
difference?  If not, we should defer to the most readable form.

True, but we can pass char* to a function taking void* without a problem
and without an explicit cast.
What's the actual problem?  The "const"?  We're effectively throwing
away the information here that res_counter_read() expects userbuf to be
constant.  If simple_read_from_buffer() ever decided to write to
userbuf, we'd be in trouble.  If simple_read_from_buffer() will never
write, then _it_ should have a const first argument.
Also, what if "userbuf" changes type?  We'll never see warnings, just
weird runtime bugs.
I just worry that these kinds of casts shut up warnings that _are_ valid
and might find real bugs.
