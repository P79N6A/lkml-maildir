Running kernel 2.4.5 with two scsi controllers - scsi0 is a sym53c8xx,
scsi1 is aic7xxx.  
For the last month or so, I've been getting the following error in my
syslog 10 or so times a day:
-----
May 31 14:09:51 dog kernel: scsi1: PCI error Interrupt at seqaddr = 0x8e
May 31 14:09:51 dog kernel: scsi1: Data Parity Error Detected during
address or write data phase
-----
The box is a PIII-750 on an Aopen AX6BC (BX chipset) running at 930Mhz
(7.5 * 124Mhz bus speed), with 384 megs of RAM (1*128MB PC100, 2*128MB
PC133).  I've tried running at 7.5*100 and I still get the errors.
Any advice as to what I should look at to solve this problem?
Thanks
