It'd be nice if people simply tried compiling a patched kernel (all
affected modules) before they submitted the patch, I'm betting you'd catch
a lot of typos.  Also, compiling _everything_, even as a module, at
least once before sumbitting the patch would probably help.
I'm sure people will miss one or two still, but so far I've found a fairly
high hit rate of things that simply won't compile in 2.5.x - also the main
reason that I hadn't actually used a 2.5.x kernel until now.
