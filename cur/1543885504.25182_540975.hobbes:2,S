Subject: [PATCH] libata: fallback to the other IDENTIFY on device error
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

It seems the world isn't as frank as we thought and some devices lie
about who they are.  Fallback to the other IDENTIFY if IDENTIFY fails
with device error.  As this is the strategy used by IDE for a long
time, it shouldn't cause too much problem.

Willam, please verify this fixes your problem.  Jeff, after all, we
seem to need this.  :-(
