Look, all of this is VERY simple. There is only one single person you
have to convince to get this into the kernel. And you DO have to convince
him, because no matter how many others you try to force this upon, nothing
gets into the kernel without the consent of the almighty penguin.
So do us all a favour, send this patch to Linus. I'd give you a 1/10 chance
of getting a reply at all, and a 1/100000000000000 that the answer won't
be along the terms of "No way in hell, never!" (possibly worded a bit
different.) If you don't get any response in say a week or so, just give
up.
