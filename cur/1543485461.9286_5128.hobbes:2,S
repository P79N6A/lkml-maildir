	You never tried 4.4BSD, right?

	Then egcs/gcc is broken. Period. POSIX doesn't mandate failure on
such operation. All *BSD do the same as Linux. And this behaviour is
consistent with unlink(). Notice that it may be even fs-dependent. Out of
curiosity - how does this fragment look like?
	Final word belongs Linus, indeed, but IMO reverting to -EBUSY on
rmdir() is *wrong*.
