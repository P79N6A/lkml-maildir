Completely wrong.  However if the driver is distributed as built-in, then it 
would need to be licensed under GPL.  This means that a driver can be 
written and distributed as a module under any licence, proprietary or 
otherwise, presumably with the restriction that it may NOT be built-in.

It is precisely the fact that it is a loadable module, and does not form 
part of the kernel, that removes the requirement to distribute it under GPL.

And that "hint" is a lie.
