	Oh. My. $DEITY. From what I've seen in old patches it looks like
path-dependent permissions (as in "boolean function of permissions in all
parents") and it's deeply alien to any UNIX. E.g. there is that little
inconvenient detail: link(2). There are symlinks and associated problems -
path you are checking may have _nothing_ to the path you've passed to the
kernel. Ironically, bindings may be more convenient - there, at least, you
can trace the real path.
	Strategy for fixing your problems: find all places where you are
interested in the path and make sure that you pass vfsmount to each of
them (in addition to dentry). If you will show the list of such places
(or, at least, ones that give you problems) there is a chance that I will
be able to help. Trying to catch _some_ parent is fundamentally bogus -
you are playing with the things that are path-dependent and thus you _are_
interested in the mount structure. And dentry is not an object that would
identify a positiion in namespace. To do that in clear way you need
vfsmount - it distinguishes between different instances of fs object
object in the namespace.
	Regardless of that, I have a strong gut feeling that permissions
in a point requiring the knowledge of _path_ are too alien to UNIX model
to be useful - either you have to disable a lot of things that are
normally used by basic utilities _or_ you are punching holes in your
security model. But hey, it's your patch and your time... There is no
fundamental problem in doing what you do with the new VFS architecture
(see above for a way to do it), so...
