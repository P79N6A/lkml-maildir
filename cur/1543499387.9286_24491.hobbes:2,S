My understanding of the problem (in 2.2.x) is that audio I/O goes
through the kernel lock -- when an audio app calls write(),
sys_write() grabs the kernel lock.  This means that audio I/O is
single-threaded with all the other things that hold the kernel lock.
Some of those things, e.g., sys_sync(), hold the kernel lock for a
really loooong time.  Audio I/O can hold the kernel lock for a really
long time too, BTW -- write can block indefinitely with a really
huge buffer.
The ideal solution is to eliminate the kernel lock.  Obviously,
this is hard. (-:
One potential, but ugly, way to work around the problem would be to
make the audio path bypass the lock.  Since this is a part of making
the kernel lock less pervasive, it might be worthwhile to do this,
even if it's ugly.
Here's the outline.
	1. Define a new flag in struct file.  Call it F_NOKLOCK.
	   (This flag should not be user-visible, so I don't think it
	   can go in f_flags.  But somewhere in struct file, because
	   that's the toplevel data structure, and the toplevel
	   routines grab the lock.)
	2. sys_write, sys_read, sys_ioctl and some other
	   routines change this:
		lock_kernel();
		do_something();
		unlock_kernel();
	   to this:
		int lockme = !(file->f_flags & F_NOKLOCK);
		if (lockme)
			lock_kernel();
		do_something();
		if (lockme)
			unlock_kernel();
	3. Sound drivers that are not dependent on the kernel
	   lock can set F_NOKLOCK.
	4. As other kernel modules -- drivers, filesystems,
	   network protocols, etc. lose their dependencies
	   on the kernel lock, they set their F_NOKLOCK bits.
	   The kernel lock gradually fades away.
In order for an audio app to maintain realtime response, it would have
to do its file I/O in a different thread, and it would have to use an
inter-thread communication mechanism that doesn't use the kernel lock.
But those are possible.
Opinions?  Comments?
If Alan or Linus encourages me, I'll do it up and mail out a patch.
