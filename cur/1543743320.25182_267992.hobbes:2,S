I'm not going to pretend to be a kernel expert, or really anything other than 
a newbie when it comes to kernel internals, so please take this with the 
merits it deserves - many, or none, depending.
Anyway, is there a way to simply signal a syscall that it is to be interrupted 
and forcibly cause the syscall to end?  Kicking the program execution out of 
kernel space would be sufficient to "unstick" the process - and coupling that 
with an automatic KILL signal may not be a bad idea.
I'm pretty sure that someone will think of a way why this wouldn't work with 
very little effort.  Please enlighten me?
