The issue that everybody seems to be forgetting (or ignoring) with
changing the headers is that ALL the drivers then also need to be
converted, and re-tested.

I have asked Atmel if they're willing to dual-license the headers.  The
licensing issue is probably now with their legal department, but I don't
see them having a problem with it.
