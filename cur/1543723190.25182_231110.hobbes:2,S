Looks like you are getting some fragmented files in xfs, and the
in memory copy of the extents is getting too large for your system to
find memory for. There are some recent changes to the memory
interface in xfs which should make it try a lot harder to get
this memory. You need Linus's bitkeeper tree or the sgi's xfs cvs
tree to get this code at the moment.
