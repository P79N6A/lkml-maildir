Erez, thanks, will definetely have to look at that to understand how
unionfs is addressing all these corner cases.
Though I don't understand all the issues involved with cache coherency
atm, one of the things you said during unionfs 2.0 release is that it
is now possible to make modifications to the lower layer directly and
they will be visible from the union. Note that since we do unioning at
VFS layer, we don't explicitly address this. Direct
modifications/additions to the lower layer will automatically get
reflected in the union. Anyway before commenting anything more on
this, let me get back and study the coherency issues more closely :)

Talking about copyup and whiteout at VFS layer, we have already
demonstrated what complexity it takes to have these within VFS. Please
take a look at the copyup and whiteout patches in our previous
releases at:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/17/150
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/14/69
Or may be wait till I clean all those up to work with the new union
new stack infrastructure which I have posted here.

Bharata.
