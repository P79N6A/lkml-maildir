The problem lies with data write evicting program pages in many cases. 
You are right that they don't need to be written, but they do need to be 
read back, so when I unhide a window there's a large delay while the 
underlying program is read back in. If the pages are dirty, then there's 
the delay while they are written.
It's exactly the benefit from having cached pages which is lost.
I would love more control in this area, but short of maintaining a patch 
I don't see it happening.
