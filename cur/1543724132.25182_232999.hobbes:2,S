I tried getting it to use the always_inline definition for gcc 3.4. It
resulted in the compilation failing in a number of places. The fixes
were generally trivial, involving rearranging the contents of files so
that inline function bodies appear before routines calling them, or
removing the inline where this isn't possible. IMHO, this is what should
be done. I didn't complete the changes, however: I thought I'd try for a
simpler solution, just in case I'm wrong.
