FWIW, I also have this exact problem on a MSI 694D Pro Ar Mainboard,
with an onboard Promise PDC20265.
Every kernel I've tried (up to 2.4.19-pre7) froze hard right after
detecting the promise controller. It only hangs if there is a (any)
device plugged into the controller.
(Don't have much more info at this point, I needed this box for work, so
it got stuck with w2k, while my primary linux box is a ump 566. <sigh>
I'd love to swap these two boxes, the 694 has a pair of 933's and a gig
of memory, and sits mostly idle)
