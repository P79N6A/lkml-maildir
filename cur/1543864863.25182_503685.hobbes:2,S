That'll be useful in a couple of years, once drives that have it
become more common.  For now, though, we're hacking current drives
using READ/WRITE LONG commands, with a corresponding patch to libata
to allow for the longer "sector size" involved.
Having real bad sectors, exactly where we want them on the media,
sure does make testing / fixing the EH mechanisms a lot more feasible.
Cheers
