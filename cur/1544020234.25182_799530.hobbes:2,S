kernel/wait.c uses struct wait_bit_key; void * was merely for keeping it
as private as possible, though it is exposed for the sake of macros like
DEFINE_WAIT_BIT et al. It would make little difference to the pagecache
waitqueue code if the structure were augmented, the function prototypes
changed to reflect the argument type, etc. There are a priori guarantees
based on the objects that the lists of tasks considered won't overlap,
so unrelated structures are even possible.
