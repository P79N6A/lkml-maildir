x86_64 doesn't set KBUILD_IMAGE, and hence defaults to vmlinux. This
confuses make rpm in such a manner that it copies a raw ELF executable
to /boot/vmlinuz-$VERSION.$PATCHLEVEL.$SUBLEVEL$EXTRAVERSION instead of
the expected bzImage, which is surprisingly unbootable and not what's
normally expected to be placed in /boot/ with that filename.
Just setting the variable is enough to convince it to use bzImage properly.
