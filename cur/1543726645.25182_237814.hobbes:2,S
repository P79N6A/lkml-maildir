UDP is prone to *much* weirded behavior than TCP in the face of things
like this.  I once had an NFS server and client using UDP.  A had its
block size set to 8K, B to 32K.  For some reason the mount succeeded
with these options, but when you copied a file from A to B (like, oh,
say, /etc/passwd), it "worked", but the file was truncated to 8K!  The
only indication that anything was wrong (other than hundreds of users
unable to log in) was a mild warning in the logs.
I am not sure what would have happened with a TCP mount, but not that!
