	That is a contentious issue that has been debated on this group far too
much. In the United States, at least, the answer comes down to the complex
legal question of whether the module is a "derived work" of the Linux kernel
and whether the kernel as shipped with those modules is a "mere
aggregation".
	You can google those terms to form your own opinions. IMO, discussing and
debating these type of borderline GPL violations on the LKML is not a good
idea. Save bringing up GPL violations on the LKML for cases where the
violation is really obvious and all measures short of public shaming have
already been tried.
