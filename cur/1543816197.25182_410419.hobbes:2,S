Vague, and wrong too ;) No new driver this time around.
I've checked all the patches and they match my own stack, so this is a
successful resync once again. Well done!
You still have 10 pending patches from me though (sent yesterday) and
there will most certainly be at least two more by the end of the week
(two RTC i2c drivers use tasklets in forbidden conditions and need to
be fixed.)
Thanks,
