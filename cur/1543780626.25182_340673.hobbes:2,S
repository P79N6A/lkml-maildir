Thanks.  This is definitely a step in the right direction.   However
I think it still needs a bit of work.
The old md_unregister_thread sent a signal to the thread so that if it
was in 'wait_event_interruptible_timeout', that call would complete.
However I cannot see how the new md_unregister_thread will interrupt
the wait_event_interruptible_timeout.
I'll look into it..
Thanks,
