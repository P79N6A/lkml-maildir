The kernel should not have a feature that is not used on the system.  This
is a basic principle of both information security and computer security:
if you don't use something, disable it.
This is one (I'd claim the main) reason why the ability to disable
(for instance) the networking stack in the kernel at compile time is
so useful: there is no way for that kernel to do networking no matter
how the boot gets tweaked.

Actually, there is for /.  In kernel version 2.2.13 (the version I'm currently
running, mostly because I haven't had time to upgrade), in fs/namei.c,
lines 514 and 515 (in a utility function called may_delete()... gee,
I wonder what that does?):
	if (IS_ROOT(victim))
		return -EBUSY;
So you see, there _is_ a check in the kernel that prevents you from
deleting the root directory.

Oh, yes. I'm just a laborer in the vineyard, near the 2A vine.  Others can
tend 1A, 5A... I sure wish somebody would volunteer to take care of 9A and
10A, though. Lot of weeds growing in there.                 Woodchuck, 1999
