Ha! We maintain two such bitmaps. And they get out of sync too.
You talk too easily. "If you receive a release event".
But one does not receive release events, one receives bytes.
The interpretation of those bytes belongs to the keyboard driver.
But i8042.c needs to know whether scancodes are releases
in order to do its massaging of the scancodes before giving
them to the keyboard driver.
I regard i8042.c as fundamentally broken.
On the other hand, it almost works.
