You cannot get "Disk quota exceeded" on a lookup. If treequota_check
finds a discrepancy it fixes it with "notify_change" with
ia_valid set to ATTR_FORCE | ATTR_TID.
I changed quota_transfer to take ATTR_FORCE to mean "just do it, even
if it exceeds quota, and don't give an error".   Given that ATTR_FORCE
is not actually used at all in the current kernel, I felt fairly free
to interpret it how I wanted.
So the only non-intuitive thing that can happen is that you find your
usage mysteriously changes.  However this can only happen after
administrator intervention, and with uid quotas administrator
intervention (e.g. chown -R) can equally cause mysterious changes of
usage.
However I'm not particularly trying to convince anyone to use or
approve of tree-quotas.  I was after comments to make sure that I
hadn't missed something in thinking through the issues.  I thank you
and others for your comments.  The fact that I am comfortable with my
answers (though you may not be) encourages me that I haven't missed
anything.
I will be using treequotas locally next year and will keep the
patches on my web-page up-to-date.  I have heard from at least one
person who thinks they might be useful, so there are probably a few
dozen who might find it useful.
In 6-12 months, if my experience is all positive, I might try
suggesting that they get included in a "standard" kernel (assuming
that 2.5 has openned by then:-).
Thanks again,
NeilBrown
