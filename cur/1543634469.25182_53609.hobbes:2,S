Silent is definately not good.  Oh well.

Changing semantics like that is dangerous.  We have no way of knowing if 
any applications rely on the existing behaviour, and furthermore if 
changing it will silently introduce security holes.

Noted.  Perhaps the current usage counts of the various limits should 
be atomic types, or maybe the spinlock is enough.  If Linus is actually 
interested in the patch, this could be easily fixed up.  Also, a few 
parts of the kernel were suspiciously different in their use of euid/suid 
instead of the plain old uid.  It would be nice if someone could double 
check that these places are correct.

I would hope that the per-cpu slab caches are fast enough.

Whoops, that was a dirty workaround for the breakage of 2.5.23.
