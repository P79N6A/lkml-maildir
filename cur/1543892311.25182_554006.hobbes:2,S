sparse treats _Bool as 1-bit integer type.  It's considerably more
complicated beast; for one thing (_Bool)2 is 1, not 0.  For another,
several places make unpleasant assumptions that size in bits is a
multiple of bits_in_char.  Which would be fine, but sparse has it
set to 1 for _Bool.  With obvious results...
