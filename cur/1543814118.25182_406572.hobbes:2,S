None yet. Wanted to iron out the collection/utility aspects a bit before 
going into
the performance impact.
But this seems as good a time as any to collect some stats
using the usual suspects lmbench, kernbench, hackbench etc.

Might have been from an older iteration where schedstats was fully enabled.
But no point speculating....will run with this set of patches and see 
what shakes out.
One point about the overhead is that it depends on the frequency with 
which data is
collected. So a proper test would probably be a comparison of a 
non-patched kernel
with
a) patches applied but delay accounting not turned on at boot i.e. cost 
of the checks
b) delay accounting turned on but not being read
c) delay accounting turned on and data read for all tasks at some 
"reasonable" rate
Will that be good  ? Other suggestions welcome.
