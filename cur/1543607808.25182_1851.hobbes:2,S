no, there are examples with too long lines, or
scratched wires where the links stay up, but even arp
doesn't work.

no, simply sending ARP request for a known IP address
which will reply, so generate traffic that can be
counted to tell wether a NIC seems working or not.
I didn't try to set my own IP address though. Perhaps
with arp_filter properly set this could be usefull...

Willy
