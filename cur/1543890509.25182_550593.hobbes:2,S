Hi Andrey
> This has been working up and including -rc2:
I have tried to reproduce here - but it just works.
I then took a second look at your excellent bug-report and noticed:
> 
> {pts/1}% sudo make -C ~/src/linux-git O=$HOME/build/linux-2.6.22 M=PWD V=1 
that in this commandline you say M=PWD
> modules_install
> make: Entering directory `/home/bor/src/linux-git'
> make -C /home/bor/build/linux-2.6.22 \
>         KBUILD_SRC=/home/bor/src/linux-git \
>         KBUILD_EXTMOD="PWD" -f /home/bor/src/linux-git/Makefile
which tell kbuild that module is in a directory named 'PWD' as seen in the
assignment to KBUILD_EXTMOD in the above line.
Could it be that you by accident omitted a '$' in front of PWD?
This would then tell kbuild that module are in the directory pointed to by $PWD.
