Yes, and it's out of Linux/*nic scope.

Not exactly. When you mounted Novell's volume using DOS (or unix, or
whatever) namespace you CAN NOT use name from other namespace to open file
or something. With vfat you can and THIS is biggest problem.

1) Not SO fundamental.
2) Filesystems come and gone, *nix will stay
Sane support for foreign fylesystem is NOT valid reason to make
fundamental changes in *nix/Linyx filesystem design. They are FOREIGN
after all. If Linux supports them somehow -- it's bonus. Plus in most
cases just few ioctls will be enough.
