Even without the patch, you can't guarantee that nobody will create a link
just before the supposed-to-be-final unlink(), or copies the file around.
Having undelete() will just make this risk very obvious.
BTW: If you really want to delete files, use shred.

It is free space, but it can be unfreed in order to
a) restore the data (on demand)
b) store new data (automatically, no tool needed)
If b happens before a, it's called bad luck.
This concept is fundamentally different from keeping a recycle bin
of 10 % disksize for each of the 20 users (adding up to 200 % of the
disk size), which is well-known from a colorfull "operating" system.
