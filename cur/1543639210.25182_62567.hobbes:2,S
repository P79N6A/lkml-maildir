They are on the mainboard, but mainboard has also (in my case VIA) IDE
chipset on the shelf, and BIOS shows everywhere (autodetection, IDE config)
that VIA is the primary chipset, and PDC ('UDMA100' interface in the BIOS)
is an additional, optional, interface. So forcing PDC20265 as primary is 
a bug - it is not consistent with BIOS, it is not consistent with Windows, 
and it is not consistent with other Linux versions.
Up to now nobody showed me mainboard which has PDC20265, but which does
not have other IDE chipset integrated in the southbridge, or at least
mainbord with BIOS which names disks connected to the PDC primary/secondary
master/slave. It is 3rd/4th channel on all mainboards I ever saw.
