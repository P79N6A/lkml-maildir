That could be arranged ...  The Xensource offices are just up the road
from Google, you know if I wanted to kill two birds with one stone.
Seriously, though, although I tolerate voyager breakage through the
merge window, I actively try to clean it up and have a working voyager
for the next release.  There's no real excuse for not fixing build
breakage.  How it's done, I don't really care.  The only blocker for the
two patch smp consolidation + voyager fix was Andi ... if he's relaxing
that, then we can go that route.
Until this is fixed, there are going to be -rc testers firing off build
failure reports, which I think we'd all like to
