I'm assuming that your config is using full RT preemption.  Also, you
need to raise the priority of the interrupt thread of the serial, so
that both the program reading the serial and the serial interrupt are
higher than all else running on the system.  This should keep the
timings down.

There shouldn't be any drivers that are showing long latencies.  Again,
make sure your program and the serial interrupt are above all else.

If you want, you can send a compressed version of your config.
