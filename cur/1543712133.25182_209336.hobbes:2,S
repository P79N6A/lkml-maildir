There is some code duplication, yes.  But the right userspace solution 
does not have a larger RSS, and has _less_ complicated management 
interfaces.  A key benefit of "do it in userland" is a clear gain in 
flexibility, simplicity, and debuggability (if that's a word).
But it's hard.  It requires some deep thinking.  It's a whole lot easier 
to do everything in the kernel -- but that doesn't offer you the 
protections of userland, particularly separate address spaces from the 
kernel, and having to try harder to crash the kernel.  :)
