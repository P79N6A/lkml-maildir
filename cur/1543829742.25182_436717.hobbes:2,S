Hi,
 when i try to unload a wlan driver i get  the message:
 Badness in remove_proc_entry at fs/proc/generic.c:705
  This comes from the statment in the driver:
wlan_proc_remove("wlan");
  How does one solve the problem.
  This wlan driver was in 2.4. i ported it to 2.6. Is there any
difference as far as wlan/networking unregistering is concerned for a
wlan driver.
  Any pointers?
 Please Advice.
Regards,
sriram
