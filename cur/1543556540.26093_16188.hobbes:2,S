It can block.
Funny, no message on this list has been quite right ;)
/dev/console can block
/dev/ttyS0   can block
printk()     never blocks
init(8) reads the tty settings from /etc/ioctl.save at startup.
After it leaves single user mode it writes that file again. So
mods made in single user mode are saved to /etc/ioctl.save.
Every time init executes a program, it restores the console
settings to those from /etc/ioctl.save.
[Perhaps I should rip that stuff out]
However a getty on /dev/ttyS0 which you usually have running in
runlevels [12345789] can change the tty settings and they will
take effect immidiately. So if you run a getty that turns on
hardware handshaking (like mgetty) - you're fscked.
The only things in which /dev/console is special are:
- it's an alias for the current console
- it's always opened with O_NOCTTY
