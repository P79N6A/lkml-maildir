The first threshold - "we are about to swap" - means the application
frees memory that it can.  Eg. free()d memory that glibc has not yet
given back to the kernel, or JVM running the garbage collector, or ...
The second threshold - "we are out of memory" - means that the first
approach has failed and the system needs to do something else. On an
embedded system, I would expect some application to exit or maybe
restart itself.
