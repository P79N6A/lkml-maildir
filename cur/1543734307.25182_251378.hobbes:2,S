Indeed last i heard, it was unuseable for low latency locking, for this 
case (lock acquisition after relinquish on remote processor) we may be 
able to put up with the higher latency.

Good point, i can see this scenario occuring on current processors.

Yes i noted too, currently it doesn't support any additional options 
to affect how the processor halts during mwait, intel could indeed pull a 
number and make the default ultra high wakeup latency mode. I truly 
hope they don't as it really would make the whole thing useless.

Well the i386 and x86_64 versions were purely for testing purposes on my 
part, i'm content with dropping them. The main user was going to be PPC64, 
but i felt compelled to throw in an architecture implementation.
