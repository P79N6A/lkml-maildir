Linus,
This patch fixes a problem when JFS is used with CONFIG_PREEMPT enabled.
There was a timing window that apparently didn't hurt us on SMP, but is
very easily hit with CONFIG_PREEMPT.
This patch can be pulled from bk://jfs.bkbits.net/linux-2.5

  JFS: Releasing LOGGC_LOCK too early
  
  In txLazyCommit, we are releasing log->gclock (LOGGC_LOCK) before
  checking tblk->flag for tblkGC_LAZY.  For the case that tblkGC_LAZY
  is not set, the user thread may release the tblk, and it may be
  reused and the tblkGC_LAZY bit set again, between the time we release
  the spinlock until we check the flag.  This is a lot to happen in an
  SMP environment, but when CONFIG_PREEMPT is set, it is very easy to
  see the problem.
  
  The fix is to hold the spinlock until after we've checked the flag.
  
  (Yes, I know the symbol names are ugly.)
