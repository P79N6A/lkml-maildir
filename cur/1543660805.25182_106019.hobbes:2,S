Please don't apply this. It breaks stuff:
1. apic_suspend() unconditionally calls disable_apic_nmi_watchdog()
   apic_resume() unconditionally calls setup_apic_nmi_watchdog()
   apic_pm_state.perfctr_pmdev removed
   - You're calling local-APIC NMI watchdog procedures even if
     the local-APIC NMI watchdog isn't active. Bad.
   - You're hardcoding that the local-APIC NMI watchdog is the
     only possible sub-client of the local APIC. Not true.
   - perfctr_pmdev exists precisely to handle both these cases
     in a clean way.
2. You unconditionally register apic_driver with its suspend/resume
   methods through a device_initcall().
   This breaks if a UP_APIC or SMP kernel runs on a CPU with no or
   an unusable local APIC. apic_pm_init2() does a runtime check
   for successful init before doing a pm_register().
3. You severed the link between the PM API and the local APIC.
   This breaks APM suspend when the local APIC is enabled. The
   machine will hang (or immediately resume). I tested this, and
   the driver model "stuff" simply doesn't do the right thing yet.
I you just want SOFTWARE_SUSPEND to work, why not simply post the
appropriate PM_SUSPEND and PM_RESUME events?
That should work without any changes to apic.c or nmi.c.
