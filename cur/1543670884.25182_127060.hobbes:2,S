Well it isn't. The AT&T clone assembler will resolve forward
references and it does it by using as many passes as necessary.
It even has a 'reasonable' MACRO capability. I use it quite a
bit to minimize the code-size or to maximize performance in
embedded systems.
Your error shown above is a real error. If you expose the code
that it barfed on, maybe somebody could help you fix the code.

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
