  Hi, all. Version 89 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This is against 2.2.0. Highlights of this release:
- Switched to C data types in include/linux/devfs_fs.h
- Switched from PATH_MAX to DEVFS_PATHLEN
- Updated Documentation/filesystems/devfs/modules.conf to take account
  of reverse scanning (!) by modprobe
- Ported to kernel 2.2.0
				Regards,
					Richard....
