Imagine a slightly larger than normal Oracle server.
Say 5000 processes with 1 GB of shared memory.
Just the page tables needed to map this memory would
take up 5 GB of RAM ... with shared page tables we
only need 1 MB of page tables.
The corresponding reduction in rmaps is a nice bonus,
but hardly any more dramatic than the page table
overhead.
In short, we really really want shared page tables.

Rik
