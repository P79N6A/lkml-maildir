it means there is code that is not marked as init making references 
function/data that is marked as init ... this is normally not noticed at boot 
as the init sections arent cleared/clobbered until well after boot and 
usually these are problems just for initialization routines ...
i'd review the symbols that are being warned about here to see if they're 
missing the proper section markers (aka functions that should be labeled as 
__init but arent)
