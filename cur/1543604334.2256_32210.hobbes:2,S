Very carefully, and with architecture-specific concerns.
There are some #defines you will probably need to study:
PAGE_OFFSET
TASK_SIZE
and probably others...
in at least the ARM architecture, ioremap is also a concern with
VMALLOC_START and VMALLOC_END
Someone else may have a pat answer just to get the job done, though.
HTH,
