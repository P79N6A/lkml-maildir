I've had (I now have 2.4.1 with dma off) the problems with a KT7,
although according to the BIOS its set to 100FSB/33PCI and the option
to tweak the clock further is set to zero
One further thought though - 1/3 of 100 is actually 33.3333Mhz.  What
if the flexibility in the motherboard is actually causing the bus to
be exactly 1/3 of 100
Interpolating according to Byron Stanoszek's table  for UDMA-33 (where
I have the problem) this could have a not insignificant effect on the
paramter given the chip.
