This is a safe approch (no risk of corruption etc..). However to provide
the same semantics of the other filesystems it would be even better if
we could unpack the tail within reiserfs_get_block_direct_io rather than
returning -EINVAL, but ok, most apps should work fine anyways (and as
worse people can workaround the magic by remounting reiserfs with notail
before writing the data that will need to be handled later via
O_DIRECT).
thanks for the patch,
Andrea
