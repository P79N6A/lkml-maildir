The latest version is always available at <
http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/cml2/>.
Release 2.3.0: Thu Feb 14 19:20:38 EST 2002
	* Resync with 2.5.4, 2.5.4-dj1 and 2.4.18-pre9.
	* `menus' and `explanations' declarations are gone from the language;
	  all prompts and help info are declared by `symbols` declarations
	  now.
	* Partial fixes to support autoconfigure on Sparc by Mike Cramer.
This doesn't include Linus's 2.5.5-pre1 changes, so it won't configure
ALSA.  I'll fold those in when the ALSA stuff shows up in Dave Jones's
tree.
