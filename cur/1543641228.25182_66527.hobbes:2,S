P4 System Programming Guide, Section 10.9:
The INVLPG instruction invalidates the TLB for a specific page. This 
instruction is the most efficient in cases where software only needs to 
invalidate a specific page, because it improves performance over 
invalidating the whole TLB. This instruction is not affected by the 
state of the G flag in a page-directory or page-table entry.
