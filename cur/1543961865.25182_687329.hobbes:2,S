I didn't intend that change to sneak into this patch - but it was
sort-of intentional. My rationale was, a normal rounding division does:
  (x + y/2) / y
Since our 'x' is at the upper end of our modulo space we can't add to it
for it would wrap and end up small. Therefore we do:
 (x - y/2) / y
Which would result in 1 less than expected, hence I added that 1 back.
Now I'm equally puzzled on its effect. Nor do I mind its removal, but I
would like to understand why it has such drastic effects.
