And block devices with O_DIRECT and network devices. We supported that
fine for years with get_user_pages.
The issue with DRM is just that it does something more different:
it wants to get at a AGP page outside get_user_pages doesn't work for
this because the AGP hole is often outside mem_map. For that a 
nice helper is missing.
I'm not 100% we really want a helper because it's rather obscure
requirement, unlikely to be useful for others, and it may be better 
to keep it in DRM.
