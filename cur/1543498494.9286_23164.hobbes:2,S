I've never had any probs of this kind. It started in 2.2.9-ac1 here and
I found the named patch responsible for that. The patch is not included
in 2.2.9-ac4 anymore and everything sounds well again. I use OSS and have
a SB 32pnp, by the way. As mentioned, no problems before or after the 
2.2.9-ac1..3
