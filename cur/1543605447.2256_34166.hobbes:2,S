Gets the name from the device driver, usually X is the minor number (or the 
minor number + some constant, if several drivers share a major number). The 
names are only constant if the devices are discovered in the same order.

I don't know. You don't need a device file for networking, but if there is 
some mechanism to allow stable names it would certainly be good to use it for 
network, too.

Only SCSI/sd, PCI and USB.
