Not if it's not too hard to avoid.  I think I can make it not come up by
converting TASK_STOPPED into TASK_TRACED when you use ptrace.  It will just
take some synchronization for that case.

I assume you mean stop with SIGSTOP, then attach with PTRACE_ATTACH, then
step with PTRACE_SINGLESTEP.  If you are already attached, then any stop
will report to you first in TASK_TRACED and never end up TASK_STOPPED
unless you explicitly pass a stop signal through with ptrace.
Thanks,
Roland
