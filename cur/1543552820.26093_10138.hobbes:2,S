It serializes accept() to avoid the thundering herd from the wake-all
semantics.
With the 2.4 stack that is probably not needed anymore (it was in 2.2), 
it may just work to remove the file locking (it should always be correct,
just on 2.2 it may be slower to remove it)

iirc everybody who looked at the code agrees that it needs a rewrite
badly.
