I can't see why it doesn't work, please explain.

Cool.

Ok, it is PC till SCSI->IDE transform, then it is no longer PC. :)

I know this, I want to know what for you are doing this?
Previously written data is already acknowledgment to the upper layers so you
can't do much even if you hit error on flush cache.  IMO if error happens we
should just check if failed sector is of our ordered write if not well report
it and continue.  It's cleaner and can give some (small?) performance gain.
