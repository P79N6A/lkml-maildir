This doesn't seem to be much of an improvement, really.  It still runs the
risk that the caller might have SCHIED_FIFO policy and we end up in a
spinloop until I/O completion.
Why not stick a `struct completion' at bio->bi_private, do complete() in
the end_io handler and wait_for_completion() in the caller?
I'll add the current patch to -mm for now, thanks.
