Hi,
I once reported that I was having a lot of lock ups under the new kernel.  I
got a lot of replies back talking to the requirements for the Athlon
processor (I am running a 500).  Well, I have my system dual booted (Win98
and Linux) and I haven't noticed these types of lock-ups under Win98 as I
have running the 2.3 series.  I would like to help track down the problem,
but am unsure were to look.  Could some one give me a clue?  Thanks
Nasa
