Hmm... that doesn't match my experiences here...
[phoenix:joe] $ uname -r
2.4.20-rc3
[phoenix:joe] $ mount | grep exported
/dev/md7 on /exported type ext3 (rw,usrquota)
[phoenix:joe] $ df -h | grep expor
/dev/md7              147G   98G   41G  70% /exported
[phoenix:joe] $ df -ih | grep expor
/dev/md7                 19M    844k     17M    5% /exported
This is a fairly heavily loaded NFS server (load > 10 is not uncommon).
I have seen no lockups so far. Should I be worried ?
It uses the old quota format - could that be why it's ok ?
