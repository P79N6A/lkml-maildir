First of all, try this patch : 
--- a/net/ipv4/tcp_input.c
+++ b/net/ipv4/tcp_input.c
@@ -560,7 +560,7 @@ static u32 tcp_rto_min(struct sock *sk)
        struct dst_entry *dst = __sk_dst_get(sk);
        u32 rto_min = TCP_RTO_MIN;
 
-       if (dst_metric_locked(dst, RTAX_RTO_MIN))
+       if (dst && dst_metric_locked(dst, RTAX_RTO_MIN))
                rto_min = dst->metrics[RTAX_RTO_MIN-1];
        return rto_min;
 }
If that doesn't help, then setup netconsole or serial console and 
try to capture some output from the hang.
(details on how to setup net & serial consoles can be found in 
 Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt
  and
 Documentation/serial-console.txt
)
Make sure you've set your console loglevel high enough to log 
everything.
Also try enabling sysrq in your kernel and, if possible, capture a 
sysrq+t dump when the crash happens and send in the dmesg output 
after sysrq+t - details in Documentation/sysrq.txt - there's also 
info on console log level in there.
You can also try building a kernel with most (or all) of the debug 
options found in the 'Kernel hacking' menu enabled. That can often 
help by producing extra valuable debug output (you need to be able 
to capture it though, so getting net/serial console setup as well 
is usually a good idea if the box hangs completely and you can't 
just get info by running dmesg).
Kind regards,
