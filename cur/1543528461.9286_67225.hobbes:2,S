Please try 2.2.15pre<new> and tell me if the OOM killer
kills the wrong process. I am very much interested in
tests of the OOM killer on as many different workloads
and systems as possible.
Although the killer has been tested and killed the 'right'
process almost all of the time, there might be workloads
where it doesn't kill the right process (at least, in
theory ... although I can't really think of one right now).
If you suspect you may have one of those workloads, please
try an out-of-memory situation in 2.2.15pre>=10 and tell
me if it breaks and how.
regards,
Rik
