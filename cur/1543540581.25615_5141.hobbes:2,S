I seem to be lost in a maze of documentation projects and markup terms...
If I wish to markup code in the kernel, where can I find markup guides?  I
found a bit of blurbage in the kernel-doc script.  However, it is unclear
what other tags are recommended for formatting (<b> and <pre> for example).
Is there a web page or doc that would serve as a quick reference?
(kernel-doc-nano is a bit too quick...)
I'm also a bit at a loss on how to document structures in header files.
All the uses (granted my search has not be exhaustive) seem to be for
functions.
