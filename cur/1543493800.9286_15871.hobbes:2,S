The SuSE Linux 6.0 distribution has lilo set up to load the kernel from
/boot/vmlinux but the kernel builds to /vmlinux when you do make zlilo
or similar so it seems you've done everything right, but the old kernel
still boots. You need to either copy the kernel to /boot or change the lilo
configuration file in /etc/lilo.conf
Page 316 15.2.6 of the user manual mentions this.
