Subject: 2.6.0-test5-bk8: synaptics still losing sync

Hi Peter (and Vojtech),
	I just tried -bk8 to see if synaptics behaves better in my Dell Latitude 
X200. It still gives the following errors:
Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte
Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte
Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte
Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte
Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte
Synaptics driver resynced.
Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte
...
The pointer blocks for a few tenths of seconds when the driver loses 
synchronisation. It normally happens when movin windows or starting new 
kde applications, so I think it's cpu's load related.
If I disable cpudyn (which changes the cpu speed dynamically), it seems to 
me that it works a little better.
Regards,
