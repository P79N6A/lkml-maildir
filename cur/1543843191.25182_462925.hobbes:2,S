Probably BIOS broke something during the update. Can you send me the
acpidump output from your system (acpidump is avlbl in latest pmtools
here - 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/lenb/acpi/utils/
 )
It will be great if you can open a bugzilla entry at bugme.osdl.org
under ACPI power-processor and attach all this info. there. It will help
to keep track of the bug information in a better way.
Thanks,
Venki
