I agree we need to do it.  I mostly want a base that allows us to 
not need to convert the whole network stack at once and still be able
to merge code all the way to the stable kernel.
The routing code is important for understanding design choices.  It
isn't important for merging if that makes sense.   
For everyone looking at routing choices the IPv6 routing table is
interesting because it does not use a hash table, and seems quite
possibly to be an equally fast structure that scales better.
There is something to think about there.

I have no fundamental objects to the content I have seen so far.
Please read the first email Kirill responded too.  I quoted a couple
of sections of code and described the bugs I saw with the patch.
All minor things.  The typo I was referring to was a section where the
original iteration was on an ifp variable and you called it dev
without changing the rest of the code in that section.  
The only big issue was that the patch too big, and should be split
into a patchset for better review.  One patch for the new functions,
and the an additional patch for each driver/subsystem hunk describing
why that chunk needed to be changed.
I'm still curious why many of those chunks can't use existing helper
functions, to be cleaned up.
