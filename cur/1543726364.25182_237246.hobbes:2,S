Yeah, that sounds reasonable.  You could protect a generic definition with 
#ifndef ARCH_HAS_PCIBUS_TO_NODEMASK or something...

Yeah, I think that would work.  The alternative is to simply add the field, 
initialize it in pci_alloc_bus like you're doing, and leave it to the arches 
to fill it in however they see fit.
