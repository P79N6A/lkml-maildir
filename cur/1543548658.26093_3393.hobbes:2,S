Hi,
2.4 seems to have problems scanning SCSI busses.  It
looks rather like it is scanning the first bus for
every host that it finds.
My dmesg is attached.  In my dual-P3 box, I have three
disks on the first channel of an on-board aic7xxx:
$ cat /proc/scsi/scsi
Attached devices:
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00
  Vendor: QUANTUM  Model: ATLAS IV 9 WLS   Rev: 0909
  Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 03
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 01 Lun: 00
  Vendor: QUANTUM  Model: ATLAS IV 9 WLS   Rev: 0909
  Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 03
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 02 Lun: 00
  Vendor: QUANTUM  Model: ATLAS IV 9 WLS   Rev: 0909
  Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 03
and an old HP DAT, a CDROM and a CDRW on a Tekram 395.
The driver works just fine under 2.2, but under 2.4test8,
when I insmod it, it finds the first device (the HP DAT)
and then hangs.
SysRq-P seems to show that it's trying to register the
DAT as a disk.  "dmesg" (before - the box is well dead at
this point) shows that once the software RAID sets are
setup, it "finds" the three disks again and adds the as
hdd, hde and hdf.  /proc/scsi/scsi shows only three, but
/proc/partitions shows six.
More information is below in a correspondance that I had
with the 395 driver author.
Is this a familiar picture to anyone?
Matthew.

OK.  The output is (copied by hand, since I can't find a serial
cable):
DC395x (TRM-S1040) SCSI driver 1.27, 2000-05-23
DC395x: Used settings: AdaptID=7
DC395 : Connectors ext50 int50 Termination: Auto High
DC395x (TRM-S1040): 1 adapters found
scsi2: Tekram DC395U/UW/F DC315/U v1.27 2000-05-23
scsi : 3 hosts
  Vendor: HP .. bla bla etc etc
  Type: Sequential bla bla etc etc
and then it's dead.
SysRq-P finds three places where the kernel is looping.
c0188a78-f1:	(c0188a78 t sd_detect)
c01ac394-a1:	(c01ac018 t scan_scsis_single)
and
c01e28ab-b2:	which System.map says is somewhere in
		c01e0c54 T stext_lock - maybe a stuck
		spinlock?
While rebooting (again :-) I noticed something else broken,
which makes me suspect a generic kernel bug, rather than a
driver flaw.  My dmesg is attached (sorry, too many RAID
sets to be able to catch the very top of it), but here is the
interesting bit:
Detected scsi disk sdd at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
Detected scsi disk sde at scsi0, channel 0, id 1, lun 0

For reasons known only to itself, it is detecting the disks
on the onboard aic7xxx's twice.  They appear only once in
/proc/scsi/scsi (0:0:0,, 0:1:0, 0:2:0) but multiple times in
/proc/partitions (hda-c _and_ hdd-f).
I guess the SCSI scanning is busted somehow.  I shall see if
I can't track it down.
Matthew.
