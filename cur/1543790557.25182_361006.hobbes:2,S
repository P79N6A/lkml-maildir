It is an optimization.  Most chipsets have a hole from XXX-4GB where
you can't put memory.  In most configurations the hole is only a couple
of megabytes.  Although with PCI-E I think it is now typically about 512M
because of the memory mapped PCI-E config space.
If you put in more that 4G the memory usually shows up at 4G and keeps going.
With memory hoisting that many recent chipsets implement you can see the
memory that would normally be covered by the mmio hole someplace about
4G, so you don't loose any memory in that situation.
Now that I think about it that explains why memory was missing on the
system with PCI-E the memory mapped PCI-E config space was out there
covering it up.

I have been writing BIOS's for the last 5 years, on Intel and on AMD boards.
I know exactly what the situation is for the boards and chipsets I
have been dealing with.  I actually find it mildly surprising that
desktop boards don't handle this yet.

What has this to do with 32bit and 64bit.  x86_64 (aka amd64+em64t) is
the 64bit desktop architecture, and that is what I am talking about.
Basically everything is 64bit now, the only question is how well does
the chipset and BIOS support your memory configuration.
