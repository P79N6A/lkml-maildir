Suppose you have a set of objects X, each containing pointer to object
from set Y, each y in Y being protected by a lock. To update pointer in
x from y to y' one has to take lock on y, and global lock G in this
order. To read pointer, it is enough to take G. Several x's may point to
the same y.
How to lock all y's pointed to by elements of X?
If you have recursive locking one may just: 
1. take each x from X in turn
2.     lock G
3.     take y pointed to by x
4.     unlock G
5.     lock y
6.     lock G
7.     re-check that y is still pointed to by x, and if not unlock y and go to 3
8.     unlock G
Without recursive locking what would one do, but emulate it?
Nikita.
