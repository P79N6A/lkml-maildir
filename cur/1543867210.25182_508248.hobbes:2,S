The problem is the size of "struct inode" (which is included in struct
ext3_inode_info).  There is quite a few fields in struct inode which
are only used when the inode has been opened and being referenced by
one or more file descriptors, but which take up a huge amount of
space.  One of the biggies is inode.i_data; struct address_space is
*huge*, and we're keeping a copy of it in every single inode which
we're caching.
It was next on my list on my inode-diet project that I worked on about
six months ago, but it was non-trivial, and my time got sucked away
with other projects, so I never got back to it.  But if you want to
try to save space, that's the next logical step --- we've already done
all or most of the low-hanging fruit to save space wasted by struct
inode and by extension in the ext3_inode_cache.
