Well, you should have. 16K is a more realistic figure. Tasks have their cost.
In fact:

Counting this I arrive at 51*16K = 816K. That's a whole lot of unswappable
memory. Thinking user space cheap is an automatic reflex these days. It's
sometimes misleading like all blind reflexes.
It makes me feel a fool for caring about __init and __exit.
