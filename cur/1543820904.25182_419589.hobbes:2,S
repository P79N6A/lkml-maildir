You really need to ask the firmware architects that, since this is
basically a single firmware call.
Mind you, since a lot of the parameters are used to return individual
bytes or half-words, which are then put into structures, it might be
better to pass the pointers to the structures and let the wrapper put
the values straight into the structures.
