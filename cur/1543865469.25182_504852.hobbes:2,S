I just upgraded the kernel on my System76 Gazelle laptop (basically an
ASUS Z62FP without the Microsoft tax) and the hard drive began
freezing every few minutes. I blacklisted ata_piix and the problem
went away, so that really narrows down where the bug has to be. Here's
the relevant part of the dmesg:
[  924.000000] ata1.01: exception Emask 0x0 SAct 0x0 SErr 0x0 action 0x2 frozen
[  924.000000] ata1.01: cmd a0/01:00:00:00:00/00:00:00:00:00/b0 tag 0

Complete dmesg and lspci -vvx are attached; please CC me because I'm
not subscribed. My sincere apologies if this is already fixed in the
main kernel.
