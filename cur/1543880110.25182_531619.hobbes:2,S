Realy can't or don't want (?)
So who is responsible for potential changing Linux code licensing for 
allow if not incorporate CDDL code correct interraction without breaking 
some law ?
And/or what Linux can loose on follow this king changes ?
And/or why Linux code licensing can't evolve ? Seems when Linux code was 
licensed noone was thinking about case like interraction with code under 
license like CDDL so why now it can be corrected and still many people try 
to think like "anything arond Linux must evolve .. but not Linux" (?)
Why this can't be fixes ?
If in this ponit in Linux "evniroment" can't be chaged .. sorry but is it 
not kind of hipocritics ?
