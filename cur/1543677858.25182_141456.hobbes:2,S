Not entirely. Have a look:

             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached

This is before starting OpenOffice and after quitting it.
As you can see the amount free RAM really goes up. This RAM is wasted.
It will eventually be put to use, but there's nothing wrong with speeding
this up. Reading back swap is almost certainly not the optimum way to
use it, but it's better than nothing at all, provided the RAM is not tied up.
The question is whether it's worth it in terms of IO.
