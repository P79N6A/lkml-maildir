	Hello All,  I have to chime in here .  Most of this is snipped
	away & only a comment from Linus is kept . It directly concerns
	sparclinux .

	Yup, I agree with this but where did it go ?
	I am aware that one can hack a few places in the kernel
	to get it back .  But it isn't(last I heard) implemented
	in a standard kernel .  I and several others(I am sure)
	would like to see this back in the kernel again.
	IF it is , My profound apologies .
