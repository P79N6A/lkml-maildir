Stuff of the sort already exists. Look for clear_highpage(),
clear_user_highpage() and memclear_highpage_flush (recently renamed to
zero_user_page, see -mm). But they all use kmap_atomic() -- kmap()
variants would have to be added. Also, they're all inlines, so I'm not
sure you'd be able to cut down text size, but still getting rid of
open-coding is always good.
