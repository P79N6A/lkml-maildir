wday and yday are already being calculated by rtc_time_to_tm() in
drivers/rtc/rtc-lib.c, and this function is used by about half of the
RTC class drivers.
Since yday can also be easily calculated from dd/mm/yyyy, I don't see
why those drivers who don't use rtc_time_to_tm() can't also return a
valid yday value.
