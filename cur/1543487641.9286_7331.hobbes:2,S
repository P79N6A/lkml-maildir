I had the same problem with my EPOX EP-51-MVP3E-M board. This was
fixed by the latest BIOS upgrade that I downloaded from the EPOX web
site. The README to the BIOS upgrade explicitly stated that it was
supposed to fix the "Linux power-off problem".
So it actually seems that vendors are responsive about Linux-related
compatibility problems with their hardware. Perhaps the original poster
could cite this when contacting Gigabyte.
