Subject: [2.6.0-test3] Sun JDK 1.4.2 doesn't exit properly using NPTL

Sun JDK works fine with stock RH9 kernel with or without NPTL, and
under 2.6.0-test3 without NPTL.
When running it under 2.6.0-test3 with NPTL, the parent process (for
example bash) locks up after the java process exits.  Strace shows
that the parent had been waiting in wait4(), but isn't woken up when
the children (the java process) exits via exit_group().  Sending the
parent a SIGINT makes wait4() return -ECHILD and the parent continues
as normal.  The java process runs perfectly normally during its own
lifetime.
