Subject: Replacement for "make SUBDIRS=...." in 2.5.63?

	I see that if I do something like "make SUBDIRS=net/ipv4 modules",
I get warnings like:
*** Warning: Overriding SUBDIRS on the command line can cause inconsistencies
*** Uh-oh, you have stale module entries. You messed with SUBDIRS
	What is the proper way to rebuild just one subdirectory?  How
about for building externally provided modules?  Is this is a new
limitation of kbuild?  If so, I think it will reduce my productivity,
and probably developer productivity on average.  I need to rebuild
small sets of modules or core kernel subdirectories frequently.  I'd
like to know what benefits I get from this so that I can measure
whether this really saves me time somehow.
	I suspect that this was added to support putting module
dependencies into the ".ko" files, which might be underlying issue
that needs a cost/benefit review, but perhaps there is some other
factor that I'm just unaware of.
	Any answers to these questions would be appreciated.
