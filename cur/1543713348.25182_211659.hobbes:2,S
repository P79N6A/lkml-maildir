Somehow the patch came through with extra white space at beginning of
each line, but s/^  / / fix that up.

A simple counter won't work for different file offset mapping.  It has to
be some sort of per-inode, per-block reservation tracking.  I think we are
steering in the right direction though.

This assumes all mmap start from the same file offset. IMO, it's not
generic enough. This code will only reserve 1 page for the following
case, but actually there are 4 mapping totaling 4 pages:
mmap 1 page at file offset 0
mmap 1 page at file offset HPAGE_SIZE,
mmap 1 page at file offset HPAGE_SIZE*2,
mmap 1 page at file offset HPAGE_SIZE*3,
Oh, this code broke file system quota accounting as well.
