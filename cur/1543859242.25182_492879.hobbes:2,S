I don't think I've ever used this sound driver on any of my  
PowerMacs, ranging back to my aged 400MHz box, which is (I believe)  
the only piece of hardware I own which it supports, and the ALSA  
driver plays sound on that system perfectly.  Admittedly the ALSA  
driver's a bit more flaky on my newer G5 and powerbook but I don't  
think the DMASOUND_PMAC driver _ever_ supported those (and I doubt it  
ever will).
Cheers,
