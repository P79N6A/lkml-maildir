Subject: [PATCH] [NET_SCHED] Add #ifdef CONFIG_NET_EMATCH in net/sched/cls_flow.c (latest git broken build)

Hi,
The 2.6 latest git build was broken when using the following
configuration options:
CONFIG_NET_EMATCH=n
CONFIG_NET_CLS_FLOW=y
with the following error:
net/sched/cls_flow.c: In function 'flow_dump':
net/sched/cls_flow.c:598: error: 'struct tcf_ematch_tree' has no
member named 'hdr'
make[2]: *** [net/sched/cls_flow.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [net/sched] Error 2
make: *** [net] Error 2
see the recent post by Li Zefan:
  
http://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg54434.html
The reason for this crash is that struct tcf_ematch_tree (net/pkt_cls.h) is
empty when CONFIG_NET_EMATCH is not defined.
When CONFIG_NET_EMATCH is defined, the tcf_ematch_tree structure indeed holds
a struct tcf_ematch_tree_hdr (hdr) as flow_dump() expects.
This patch adds #ifdef CONFIG_NET_EMATCH in flow_dump to avoid this.
The patch was build against latest 2.6 git net tree.
Regards,
Rami Rosen
