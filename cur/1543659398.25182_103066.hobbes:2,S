Trivial. The constant stuff gets allocated first, then the dynamic.
You can write the code in any order you want, but the code generation
is as though you did:
	char bar [0x100];
        char moby[8];
Also, vomit-stack-pointer is "f(v)omit-frame-pointer". It works
the same. No problem except when trying to find local variables
in the debugger (known -g implimentation "feature"). The frame
pointer is BP. The stack is never omitted. You can save a few
instructions if you don't use it.
