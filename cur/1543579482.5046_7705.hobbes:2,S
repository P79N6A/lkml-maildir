I don't think there's a problem then.  However, if slab can be told "I want
1024 bytes aligned to 1024 bytes" then I can get rid of
arch/arm/mm/small_page.c (separate problem to the one we're discussing
though) ;)

What I'm wondering is what about a wrapper around the slab allocator, in
a similar way to pci_alloc_consistent() is a wrapper around gfp.  Since
the slab allocator returns "pointers" in the same space as gfp returns
page references, there shouldn't be a problem (Linus may complain here).
ie, we could make pci_alloc_consistent() a little more intelligent and
allocate from the slab for small sizes, but use gfp for larger sizes?
Comments, anyone (DaveM, Linus, et al) ?
