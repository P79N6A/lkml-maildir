Speaking up APC ups's, do you use a standard 9 pin straight through rs-232
cable to connect a SmartUPS APC 1400 andr SmartUPS APC 650 to the computers?
The cables that came with my 2 upses have long since disappeared, and the last
time I tried going through the UPS HOWTO I didn't see the appropriate
information.  I really should use the intelligent software on both computers
(one is linux x86, the other is linux ppc).
