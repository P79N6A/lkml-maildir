Looks like objcopy is failing.
Could you try to run the above command by hand in the top-level
directory of your kernel tree.
If it still fails try with
LANG=C LC_ALL=C objcopy ....
Just to check that language does not have any effect here.
I doubt so, but worth the try.
I browsed the objcopy src (a random version found by google)
without seeing where it could return 132
