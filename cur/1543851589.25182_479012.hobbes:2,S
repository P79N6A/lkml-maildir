My understanding is that the only addition to the task_struct is a pointer 
to the struct container it belongs to.  Then, the various controllers can 
register the control files through the fs-based container interface and 
all the manipulation can be done at that level.  Having each task_struct 
containing pointers to individual resource nodes was never proposed.
