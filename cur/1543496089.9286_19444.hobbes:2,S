As part of the Linux Scalability Project I have implemented a hinting
system for poll to speed up network intensive applications, e.g. web
servers.
The hinting system works as follows:
The file descriptors are passed along as argument in the device
specific poll() call and the device driver keeps them in a backmapping
list.  When an an event occurs that changes the poll state, the device
driver sets a hint for all file descriptors in the backmapping list.
At process wake up, the process only needs to call the device specific
poll() function for file descriptors that have a hint.
I have run a benchmark with thttpd-2.04 and httperf-0.6 between 2.2.3-ac4
and 2.2.3-ac4 + poll hinting. I obtained the following results for
readprofile -r
httperf --server localhost --port 8080 --num-conns 100000 --rate 650
readprofile | egrep "(poll|select|wait)" | sort -k3 -nr
2.2.3-ac4:
  4017 do_select                                  6.9740

   305 max_select_fd                              1.3616
    45 tcp_poll                                   0.1114
    35 __tcp_select_window                        0.1944
    19 poll_free_wait                             0.0651
    15 sock_poll                                  0.3125
    12 tcp_timewait_state_process                 0.0435
    10 expand_poll_hints                          0.0128
They seem to indicate that the hinting system is able to avoid many
calls to {sock,inet,tcp}_poll. Perhaps somebody can explain to me how
comparable the output of readprofile is.
I am still working on this to make sure that it is bug free, but
at the moment I am fairly confident to make patches available
within about a week.
Greetings,
 Niels.
