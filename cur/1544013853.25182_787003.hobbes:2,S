yes, I know, that is why I've changed WARN_ON_ONCE to plain WARN_ON.

If you mean did I test this patch for speed regresson then to be fair --
no, I didn't. BUT we have a number of macros wich are self protective
like present_section which is used havily too. On the other hand --
bad argument passed to __nr_to_section will be (and it is now) really
harmfull -- since it would allow to reference a memory outside the
valid bounds. The second -- SECTION_ROOT_MASK wich is fragile, any
attempt to modify mem_section structure will silently lead to insane
referencing, that is why it deserve a comment on top of structure.
Don't know Christoph, if it really that important to not spend a few
cycles here in a sake of safety -- we could easily drop this patch.
