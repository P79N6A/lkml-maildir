Whatever you want to think of Mr. Thompson, the man has more programming mileage
than most people here, and Plan-9 is definitely _NOT_ a failure. 
Far from it !!
There are lots of elegances and robustness in Plan9 that are not (yet!)
available in Linux. Methinks Linux and the Linux Communities as a whole can
benefit more by paying more attentions to Linux codebase (by making it even more
robust and elegant) than flaming Ken Thompson and/or pooh-pooh(ing) elegant
works such as Plan-9.
