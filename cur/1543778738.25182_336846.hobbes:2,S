i'd rather wait with that one. A prefetch can generate a prefetch of the 
next cacheline too, so it might or might not make sense to prefetch both 
cachelines explicitly.
Also, explicity prefetching &next->timestamp is ugly because it includes 
a number of bad assumptions. If multi-cacheline prefetching becomes 
necessary then this needs to be implemented via a generic extension to 
prefetch.h:
	prefetch_area(void *first_addr, void *last_addr)
(or as addr,len)
This way an architecture can decide how it prefetches continuous 
cachelines _without knowing anything about the structure being 
prefetched_.
Also, the generic code using the prefetches could this way designate 
'cache-hot' areas without having to know about cacheline size or 
prefetching tactics of the architecture. (prefetch_area() could be done 
compile-time so it would be equivalent to a single-cacheline prefetch on 
arches with larger cachelines.)

it's a fundamental thing: we _dont_ want to push generic code into 
architectures, and there's nothing per-arch about next->mm.
thread_info is really small on most arches, and even if they are not, 
the most important data is always grouped to the top of a structure.  
(this is a pretty fundamental concept throughout the kernel)

my point is, it comes down to concrete examples, it may or may not make 
sense to do things per-arch.
If this was per-arch most arches wouldnt get this benefit, and the 
propagation of any improvements would likely stick in whatever arch did 
that. We've seen that happen too many times to not repeat this mistake 
again. We've got 24 architectures (and counting), so any code 'left to 
the architecture to control' will propagate to other architectures only 
very slowly.
try to look at it from another angle: probably only because i insisted 
on doing this in the generic code and not per-arch did we end up 
discovering the potential generic need to prefetch next->thread_info and 
next->mm.

true of course, but from this it does not follow at all that we should 
move all task-switch related prefetching into a prefetch_task() call!

great that we now agree wrt. thread_info and next->mm. My remaining 
point is, once we prefetch ->thread_info, ->mm and the kernel stack, 
nothing else significant remains! (It's still very much possible that 
something needs to be prefetched per-arch, but i'd like to see a robust 
case be made for it, instead of your global 'it might happen' argument.)
