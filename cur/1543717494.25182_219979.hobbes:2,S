I only briefly looked at the s390 crypto driver and it looks like it uses
a special /dev node along with some read/write/ioctl calls to do the
encryption. I.e. it doesn't seem to integrate with the CryptoAPI at all.
How could that be used for e.g. IPsec, cryptoloop, etc?
My padlock driver can be used for anything that uses CryptoAPI and in fact
it speeds things a lot (see a simple disk-based benchmark at
http://www.logix.cz/michal/dl/padlock.xp
).
In fact I believe that the hardware-specific drivers (e.g. the S/390 one)
should be used in the cryptoapi as well and then the kernel should provide
a single, universal device with read/write/ioctl calls for all of them.
Not making a separete device for every piece of hardware on the market.
Am I wrong?
