But there is no API stability for external modules this way.
It simply doesn't make sense to give the few sys_open() abusers even 
more grace period while changes to the IRQ API affecting nearly everyone 
are allowed without any requirements of ensuring API stability.
I'm not a fan of API stability for external modules, but if API 
stability was considered important it should be done consequently and 
not only for some patches that have the bad fate of having to go through 
Andrew to Linus.
