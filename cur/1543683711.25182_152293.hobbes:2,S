I fixed this in test2-mm1: it needs a
	ACPI_FUNCTION_TRACE("acpi_pci_link_allocate");
at the start of that function.
I made a bunch of other changes to that patch - mainly whitespace fixups. 
It is at
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.0-test2/2.6.0-test2-mm1/broken-out/nforce2-acpi-fixes.patch
I'm thinking that perhaps io_apic_irq_read_proc() and print_IO_APIC()
should be consolidated.
