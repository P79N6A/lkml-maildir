Hi Linus, John, Ethan and others!
I tried everything suggested. First I compiled my kernel to use ide-cd 
instead of ide-scsi. No success, cdrecord did hang. Fortunately the whole 
machine did not hang.
Then I tried apply a patch Linus send me. So I changed settings so that HP 
7200 ide burner is seen as ide-scsi device. After that cdrecord still 
freezes totally my machine.
I forgot to mention earlier: I tried cdrecord with older 2.4 kernel and it 
works fine (as ide-scsi device).
So I try to give more accurate info so You can debug this ide-scsi thing 
which is broken. I repeat already mentioned things so that "everything" is 
on one mail:
- Kernel 2.6.0-test11 with one patch on ide-scsi.c
- AMD Duron(tm) processor AuthenticAMD GNU/Linux
- Soltek motherboard: SL-75DRV
- Another CDROM drive: LG GCR-8520B idereader
- HP7200 Ide burner:
cat /proc/scsi/scsi
Attached devices:
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00
  Vendor: HP       Model: CD-Writer+ 7200  Rev: 3.01
  Type:   CD-ROM                           ANSI SCSI revision: 02
And then I guess this is useful too:

So here's everything I could find. Please let me know what other useful info 
I may submit. I am not guru like You are, so I need advices what to do.
With best regards,
