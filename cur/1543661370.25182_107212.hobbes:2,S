Don't let this get out, but egcs-2.91.66 compiled FFT code
works about 50 percent of the speed of whatever M$ uses for
Visual C++ Version 6.0  I was awfully disheartened when I
found that identical code executed twice as fast on M$ than
it does on Linux. I tried to isolate what was causing the
difference. So I replaced 'hypot()' with some 'C' code that
does sqrt(x^2 + y^2) just to see if it was the 'C' library.
It didn't help. When I find out what type (section) of code
is running slower, I'll report. In the meantime, it's fast
enough, but I don't like being beat by M$.
Cheers,

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
