Well, Slackware Linux usually ships with an unmodified kernel.org kernel
(there are rare cases of patches that fix security issues though). I find
this a very nice property of Slackware since there are never any problems
when replacing the default kernel with a custom build kernel.org one...
There are other minor distributions that also ship with kernel.org
kernels - I don't have a list at hand, but I've run into several over the
years.
