I started with (void) calls when I first wrote this hack,
then changed it to taking a semaphore pointer, intentionally.
The calls:
	cpuset_down(&cpuset_sem);
	cpuset_up(&cpuset_sem);
exactly replace calls:
	down(&cpuset_sem);
	up(&cpuset_sem);
I wanted that visual resemblance.
I agree, it's asymmetric, which is not so good.
But the resemblance is more valuable, in my view.
So I will stick with what I've got, unless I see stronger
signs of a concensus to the contrary.
Is that ok?
