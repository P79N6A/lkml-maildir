   On big endian computers, the nic is set into a big-endian mode, and it 
   did work with set_bit on my power mac. Unfortunately, I don't have 
   access to it right now.
How about a 64-bit system where set_bit works on 64-bit longs
and not 32-bit ones?  That is why the current code there is broken.
