hm, OK, interesting.
It's quite possible that XFS is performing rather too many GFP_ATOMIC
allocations and is depleting the page reserves.  Although increasing
/proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes should help there.
Nathan, it would be a worthwhile exercise to consider replacing GFP_ATOMIC
with (GFP_ATOMIC & ~ __GFP_HIGH) where appropriate.  This is because
GFP_ATOMIC does two distinct things:
a) Don't sleep, so we can call it from within-spinlock and interrupt contexts.
b) Dip further into the page reserves.
If there are places in XFS where it only needs one of these two behaviours,
it would be good to select just that one.
