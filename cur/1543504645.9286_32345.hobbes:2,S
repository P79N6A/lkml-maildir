What /is/ the issue with the strict aliasing code? I was under the impression
that it "merely" screwed up code that did icky things with pointers to members
of unions. Comments made here about Linus' view on the thing sounds like it
is some horrendous problem that may never get sorted. Which is the case?
Looking at the EGCS/GCC manual section for strict-aliasing, is this the sort
of `grunt work' that the unwashed multitude like myself could plow through
and fix? How big a job is it? Is it even worth it?
