So how can I increase the size of the translation cache. I read from
Transmeta's whitepaper that both BIOS and OS can do this. This mean
that I should be able to insert a little piece of code in the kernel
somewhere and experiment with the new setting. I guess it might be a PCI
register?
How about the persistent translation service on Linux?
a) Transmeta will write it for us.
b) Transmeta will open enough info. for us to write it our own.
What do you think?
