Anything wrong with 64-bit nanoseconds? It's easy to work with,
being an integer type, and it survives the year 2038.

Other than the parentheses issue, /proc/<pid>/stat can
be handled with sscanf. Nobody dinks with the format.
People "correct" the spelling and formatting in the
fancy /proc files. Is it "SigCgt" or "SigCat"? That
depends on the kernel version; somebody "fixed" the
spelling.
There isn't any BNF for any /proc file. The raw files
are easy to handle, but one can only guess at what
others will assume about the format of a fancy one.
Take /proc/cpuinfo for example. Long ago, it was like
this:
foo   some value
bar   1 2 3 4 5
baz   8000:0
Then it turned into this:
foo   : some value
bar   : 1 2 3 4 5
baz   : 8000:0
uh oh : 69
Who could have guessed?
Stuff broke. Formatted files are too damn tempting
to muck with. People don't touch the ugly files.
