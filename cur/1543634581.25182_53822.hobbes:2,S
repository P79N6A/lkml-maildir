Hi,
the version 1.41 of the Tekram DC3x5 (TRM-S1040 chip) driver has been
released.
It includes support for new exception handling (at this moment only
enabled by default on 2.5, on 2.4 you can pass FORCE_NEW_EH=1 to
the makefile to test, will be default for 2.4 when more testing has 
happened) which has been contributed by Douglas Gilbert and subsequently
completed by myself. Thanks go to Martin Peschke and Aron Zeh as well for
answering questions related to new EH.
Keith Owens has contributed a few fixes WRT to unaligned accesses and
one sg_map fix for iA64. The driver seems to work there, BTW!
The Makefiles now also support 2.5.

The usual care should be applied.
