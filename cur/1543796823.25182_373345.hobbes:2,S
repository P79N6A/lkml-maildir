Confirmed. But you are wrong; it is not a waste. The pages are nicely
linear in suspend image, while they would be all over the disk
otherwise. There can easily be factor 20 difference between linear
read and random read.

I did not understand this one.

Yes, that was very rough approximation.
Anyway, try limiting size of image to ~500MB, first. Should solve your
problem with very little work.
