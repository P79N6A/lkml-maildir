Presumably there is a bug somewhere.
kmap_atomic itself calls inc_preempt_count so that preemption should
be disabled at least until the kunmap_atomic is called.
But apparently not.  The symptoms point exactly to the page getting
unmapped when it shouldn't.  Until that bug is found and fixed, the
work around of turning of CONFIG_PREEMPT seems to make sense.
Of course it would be great if someone who can easily reproduce this
bug could do the 'git bisect' thing to find out where the bug crept
in.....
