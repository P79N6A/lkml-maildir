Yes, do it micro$oft's way... Do you think that this is really hard to
discover? I have been recently reading T13 docs and I thought that it
would be nice to try some things (similar to destroy-disk.c) when I
have some time... now I'm really happy that I didn't have time to try
them... :-)
Sendmail people once fixed something without documenting it in
changelog... and most of admins were too lazy to upgrade to new sendmail
because there weren'nt important changes... later there was exploit
using this fixed thing... get it?
By doing silent fixes you make people thing that they don't need to
upgrade... IMHO proper way of fixing security issues is the way of
how capabilities "bug" have been fixed...
Fast spreading of information have pros and cons, and you have to deal
with them... You know about some security hole... but malicious bastards
also...

Andre revealed "exploit" beacause most (all?) of his opponents were too
lazy to look at patch and kernel's code and see what it is all about!
