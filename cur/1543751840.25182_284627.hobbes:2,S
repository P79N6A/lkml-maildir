Subject: ERROR: [PATCH] moxa: Update status of Moxa Smartio driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This changeset is incorrect. The "1.8" version is for the Moxa mxser
driver. Moxa haven't released any 2.6 driver for the ancient "smartio"
hardware. (Checked this while fixing mxser).
In the mxser case that change and update has now been done.
Please revert this changeset.
