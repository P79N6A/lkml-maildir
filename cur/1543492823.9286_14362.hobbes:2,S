Part of the problem with this is that on other OS's it really is a
nessasary rule. For several AIX boxes we have I have had to add hard
drives to them so hold the swap partition becouseeven with 2G of ram each
they would run out of swap before they ran out of memory now that swap is
in the 3-4G range we are actually able to use all the memory in the
system. Linux swap does not work this way, but most unix people don't
realize it.
