If the trade-offs weigh in about the same, removing the BKL from
legitimate uses in favor of a different (neither better nor worse)
approach would be more than acceptable, would it not?
Would creating a few new names for lock_kernel() and friends be
acceptable? Just a few macros to give slightly more meaningful names to
each function call for 2.5. Then take lock_kernel() entirely away (the
name, not the function), in 2.7. By 2.9 it should be able to be removed
from nearly all "inappropriate" uses. This seems like it would encourage
more  explicit usage of the BKL, while giving maintainers ample time to
comply.
Note that I have never added or removed a lock from the kernel. I am
simply thinking aloud; half hoping to be corrected.
