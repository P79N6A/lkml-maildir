You can export the changes you want as a patch and if you ask, we'll send
you a script which also exports your checkin comments in Linus' nifty
new email->BK converter.  The format that we like (I believe, Wayne/Linus
will correct errors) is:
### Change the comments to ChangeSet below
These are the changeset comments, i.e, the email message for the patch.
### Change the comments to include/asm/whatever.h below
The comments for include/asm/whatever.h
In other words
printf("### Change the comments to %s below\n", filename);
And then it can be imported directly.
To create an extra script to do this for a bk export -tpatch is straightforward.
