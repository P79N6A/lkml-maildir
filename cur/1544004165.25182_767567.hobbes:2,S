If I understand correctly, we may want to have more than one preferred
cpu in a given sched domain, taking into account node topology i.e if a
given sched domain encompasses two nodes, then we may like to designate
2 preferred wakeup_cpu's, one per node. If that is the case, then
root_domain may not be of use here?
