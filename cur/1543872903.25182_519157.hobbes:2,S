Subject: module.h and moduleparam.h:  more header file pedantry

  well, since my last adventure with header files went over so
swimmingly, i might as well keep going.  :-)
  to my surprise, i learned only today that module.h includes
moduleparam.h, which flies in the face of all of the documentation
i've ever read which was adamant that i *had* to include moduleparam.h
if i was using parameters. i'm guessing this comes as a surprise to
the 400+ header files which include both unnecessarily.
  so ... in a perfect world, should a module source file that doesn't
use parameters *at all* need to include moduleparam.h?  as it stands
now, yes, it does, given some ugly inter-dependencies between the two
files.
  so, at the very least, programmers can stop including moduleparam.h,
unless there's a cleaner way to do all that.
