Hi,
why are you all spending your time on issues like license of some non-free
product? Why don't you sit down and work on free software? Do you want to
learn some really complex software and then want to be punished by using it
in some different project?
Linus have chosen his way. It is perfectly OK for him. It is his
decision. It is his bad decision. You do not have to follow him. He is
smart enough to admit it and change its decision in the future. Please stop
this completely useless thread and invest your (and other's too) time in an
intelligent way.
