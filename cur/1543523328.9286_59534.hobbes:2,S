Already does. See Documentation/devices.txt for gory details.

Umm... Not really. There is a bunch of nastier races around the whole
thing (and insmod sucks too - figuring out results of the following
	open /dev/foo
	request_module
	module_init
	register_blkdev
	pointer to methods table set
	initializing disk/controller
						open /dev/foo
						found the pointer
						success
						read from the thing
						woops!
	finish initialization... too late ;-<
is not too hard). So that stuff _really_ needs fixing - the races are 
pretty real and lead to Bad Things(tm). Moreover, methods should not live
on per-major level. I have a fix (testing the sucker right now), but it
changes quite a bit of block_dev.c and kills the array of pairs
name/methods...

Arrgh. Could we please forget about major:minor split?
