OK, the FIFO should be enabled.
What is known:
* The error is a hardware FIFO overrun.
  - observed message is in n_tty due to driver setting TTY_OVERRUN
* The RTS/CTS flow control is not involved
  - this is done only by the ldisc in response to buffer levels
  - you verified crtscts is set
  - you did not observed RTS change when 'overflow error' logged
  - you did observe RTS change when application stopped reading
So this seems to be a latency issue reading the receive
FIFO in the ISR. The current rx FIFO trigger level
should be 8 bytes (UART_FCR_R_TRIG_10) which gives the
ISR 694usec to get the data at 115200bps.
IIRC, in 2.2.X kernels this defaulted to 4 bytes
(TRIG_01) which gave a little more time to service the interrupt.
How does the data rate affect the frequency of the overrun errors?
Does 57600bps make them go away?
