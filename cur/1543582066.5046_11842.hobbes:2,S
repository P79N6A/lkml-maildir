Update on the "unregister_netdevice" bug ...
Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo has been valiantly trying in his
scarce free time to find the cause.  I haven't been able to
hunt effectively because I don't really understand the networking
code; however I have been experimenting to see what are the
exact conditions under which the failure occurs.  I modified
my kernel to print dev->refcnt in /proc/net/dev so that I
could see what the refcnt of eth0 is at any given moment.
One of the more interesting experiment logs is appended 
below.
Experimentation seems to show
1) It happens when ipx is used, specifically when 
   auto_interface=on and auto_primary=on
2) It happens only or especially when using DHCP
3) It happens only to PCMCIA ethernet cards
