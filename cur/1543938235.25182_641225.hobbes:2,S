I would like to Thank everybody for the quick answers!!
I also want to apologise all the unnecessary noise done in the mailing
list, maybe it wasn't the right place to post (I must say it was worth
the posting). I got some nice ideas and advices...
Lastly, I would like to answer some questions, and discuss some points told.
Stefan, what you said:
"Why back the shared memory with a file?  Wouldn't a memory buffer suffice?"...
That was discarded at the beginning, because we didn't want to spend
kernel memory, so the user would have the freedom of asking as much
memory as he'd want. The fact is that we would be using IO on the
kernel, and it has been told, that it shouldn't be done...
Jan, our idea obviously wasn't that the user program used the syscalls
directly, instead he would use a library to ask for memory, attach,
etc (It wouldn't loose that much portability). Thanks for the book
suggestion.. I will try to read it!
Greetings, Rafael Sisto.
