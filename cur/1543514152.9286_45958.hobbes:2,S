Yes, maybe it does. But it does not mean it should. Because Intel MP v1.4
specification states in the section 2.1.1 "System Processors" that it is
designed for Intel486 and Pentium processors. So, having valid SMP support
for anything below 486 is "beyond the scope of Intel's specifications" and
therefore is of purely academical value.

PS. Mind you, UnixWare 7.x box also says requires Pentium bla-bla-bla and
I run it on a i486/32M RAM on one of the home machines.
