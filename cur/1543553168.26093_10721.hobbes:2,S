	Alan, I'll grant that what Jeff is attempting to do is laudable.
It's just that I have experience with Netware 3.x and 4.x in the field
(Ok...  More 3.x than 4.x) and I have more than passing familiarity with
5.x security problems.  I know he wants to achieve some of the good things
that Novell managed.  I know, from first hand experience, what cost some
of those come at.  Can he achieve the goal of matching the good while
avoiding the bad?  I hope so.  He won't do it by promoting what he
perceives as the advantages of Novell over Linux without at least some
passing acknowledgement of the failures of Novell, the disadvantages, and
the costs.  I think his goals are good and his head is in the right spot,
I just don't want to see history repeat itself.  He has my best wishes,
since both he and Linux will benefit.
	My $0.02.
	Mike
