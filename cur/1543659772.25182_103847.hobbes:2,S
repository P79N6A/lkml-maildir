    Does it have to be an exec? 
    Perhaps something like this:
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	if (fork ()) {
		strcpy (argv[0], "Fake name 00001");
		setpgrp (); /* very important when dealing with stuff like this */
		pause(); /* code for personality "Fake name 00001" */
		return 0;
	}
	strcpy (argv[0], "Fake name 00002");
	setpgrp ();
	pause(); /* code for personality "Fake name 00002" */
}
    this thing works - at least on my box...
    But, of course, I could be mistaken, and I miss to see some other 
important details. Good luck.
    Dorin.
