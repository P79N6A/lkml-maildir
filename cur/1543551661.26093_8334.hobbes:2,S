Robert Kaiser didn't write this. I did. And yes. It makes no difference
about the 'board' it's in the chip.

The keyboard controller is in a seperate Super I/O chip. You can
'pretend' to go through the motions, but there is no connection
whatsoever (no pin, no trace) to connect the keyboard output bit
to A<20> enable. It's all done by the AMD internal snoop.
So if you write the right stuff to the right port, the bit is
enabled.

Many who use Linux in embeded systems write their own BIOS as I
have done. Then you don't have to pay $10/box you ship to a BIOS
vendor who ripped off all the code anyway.
FYI, the code that was submitted can't possibly work (it was backwards).
If it made your board 'work' there is something else broken.
