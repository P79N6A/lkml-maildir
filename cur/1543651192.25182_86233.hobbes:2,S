Just FYI. I tested the ide-cd based CD burning and reading with the
cdrtools alpha ... kernel 2.5.44-mm6, cdrtools-1.11a39. If I boot
into a clean system, only load ide-cd (none of the ide-scsi-related
bits), and "do it", it works well.
Invocations:
cdda2wav dev=/dev/hdc 1
cdrecord dev=ATAPI:0,0,0 -data dir.iso
I do get a lot of warnings from the block layer, though, as below.
I get some warnings, then it counts down, and it spits out more
warnings, but then it tells me it wrote out a track, writes the TOC,
and terminates successfully.
