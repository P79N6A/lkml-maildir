I didn't ask for a fix, I was offering a problem report, from a machine
with no lkml or anything else (don't let the name and IP fool you, I was
testing). I was trying to add it to my summary of recent kernels which run
well on small slow machines which might be available for the asking.
I included the config because I thought the P5 might be triggering a
problem others hadn't tested, but it looks as if everyone had the problem.
I thought these were like -ac patches which has already been tested to see
if they compile.
