True. You are right it is a potential source of dead locking. The
initial reason to implement it that way was that I wanted to avoid cross
cpu enqueueing for the high resolution timer case as I thought it would
make cross cpu timer event reprogramming necessary. But this is actually
a non issue, as the reprogramming check can be done after the timer
function has completed on the CPU where the function is running.
The loop is not necessary. I'll fix that up.

Right. The return value must only be set on the first call to
remove_ktimer, but this is a non issue after removing the loop anyway.
Thanks for pointing this out,
