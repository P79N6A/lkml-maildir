hi...
in response to a performance issue with disk i/o when using the postgresql
database (maintained and developed mostly by bsd users, though used by many
linux users) the following has come up... 
(i'm not on the kernel list, so could all replies be cc'd to me directly? mucho
thanks!)

Look what I found. I downloaded Linux kernel source for 2.2.0, and
started looking for the word 'ahead' in the file system files.  I found
that read-ahead seems to be controlled by f_reada, and look where I
found it being turned off?  Seems like any seek turns off read-ahead on
Linux.
When you do a read or write, it seems to be turned on again.  Once you
read/write, the next read/write will do read-ahead, assuming you don't
do any lseek() before the second read/write().
Seems like the algorithm in psort now is rarely having read-ahead on
Linux, while other OS's check to see if the read-ahead was eventually
used, and control read-ahead that way.
read-head also seems be off on the first read from a file.
