These are patches designed to improve system responsiveness. It is 
configurable to any workload but the default ck* patch is aimed at the 
desktop and ck*-server is available with more emphasis on serverspace.
This is a maintenance release and is identical to 2.6.10-ck5 apart from 
using 2.6.10-as5 with it's updated security and bugfixes for 2.6.10 
(thanks to Andres Salomon for maintaining this).
