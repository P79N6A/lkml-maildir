I have already stuffed kernel source with debugging printk's, etc.,
so hopefully we could more precisely say where the problem is. Anyway
it will probably take quite a long to determine because (as I previously
said in our "private" e-mail exchange) it takes long hours to crash.
(eg. today mlnetd was killed twice but no system crash yet)
Now, I am starting mlnet in a 'while [ 1 ]; do mlnet; done;' loop just
in case it gets killed and let's see what will happen during the night.

Well, most of the time I use only X11+ctwm+aterm+vim+gcc (and sometimes
mozilla or xpdf) so the fact is that mlnetd is the best candidate for
such things since it is the only one on my box which uses resources so
intensively (a few hundrets open sockets constantly being opened and
closed, ram usage ~10% of 512MB, cpu usage ~20% of D1200, etc.).

Sure, I will keep all the oopses. For now I'm gonna collect them on
my webpage in 
http://secprog.org/who/rs/linux/
 (I will report when there
is something new so there is no need to poll() ;>). And then if you are
interested in registering them in bugme, will do it.
Btw. Linus, there is no need CC'ing messages to my e-mail. I will follow
this thread on lkml.
