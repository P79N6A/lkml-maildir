Subject: [PATCH] i386: put HOTPLUG_CPU under Processor type, not Bus options
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Randy Dunlap <rdunlap@xenotime.net>
Move the HOTPLUG_CPU option under "Processor type" instead of under
"Bus options".  This makes it the same for i386 as most other processor
types (arm, ia64, parisc, ppc, s390, & x86_64; but not for powerpc).
Besides, it takes me too long to find it under Bus options.
I can't be the only person who has trouble finding it.
