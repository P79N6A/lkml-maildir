because:
 - static tracepoints, once added, are very hard to remove - up until
   eternity. (On the other hand, markers for dynamic tracers are easily 
   removed, either via making the dynamic tracer smarter, or by 
   detaching the marker via the patch(1) method. In any case, if a 
   marker goes away then hell does not break loose in dynamic tracing 
   land - but it does in static tracing land.
 - the markers needed for dynamic tracing are different from the LTT
   static tracepoints.
 - a marker for dynamic tracing has lower performance impact than a 
   static tracepoint, on systems that are not being traced. (but which 
   have the tracing infrastructure enabled otherwise)
 - having static tracepoints dillutes the incentive for architectures to
   implement proper kprobes support.

hm, so you dont consider the above paragraph a whine. How would you 
characterize it then? A measured, balanced, on-topic technical comment? 
I'm truly curious.
