Possibly, but my gut feeling says no and so do any benchmarks I've
seen regarding queue depths on adaptec controllers (not that I've seen
many).  For relatively-closeby IOs, the disk will always have a better
idea of how to optimise a number of IOs than the Linux elevator can
have, especially if we have multiple IOs spanning multiple heads
within a single cylinder.
