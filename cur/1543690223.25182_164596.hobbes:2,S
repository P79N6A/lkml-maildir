Is it that simple?  My reading is that it will do very bad things,
e.g., to pipe roundtrip latency on SMP machines.  Something that the
O(1) scheduler has handled nicely so far.
My preference would have been to break affinity only in the presence
of a _persistent_ load imbalance of >> 1.  For example, it's perfectly
OK and indeed encouraged to run N tasks on one and the same CPU, if
those tasks are (almost) never runnable at the same time.
