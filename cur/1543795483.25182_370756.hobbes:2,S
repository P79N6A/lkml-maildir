1) Use the backup to get a base on a completely seperate HDD.
1a) Feel glad about having a backup.
2) Find new and changed files on the corrupted disk.
3) For each of the files found, inspect it's contents and copy it over
   if it's non-corrupted. You can't automatically find corrupted files
   unless you know otherwise.
4) mkfs
