Nope, and I don't expect them to be checking all the time.
This is as much kernel people's problem as glibc people's.
We, as kernel people, need a system that the glibc people can
get this crap automatically.  The glibc folks can then just use
it and everything just works.

There is a very small amount of effort necessary to fix this
particular problem, it won't be the end of the world if we fix the
kernel header in the actual kernel sources for them.
