I tested it on a 2way box with a piix controller. It got through Bonnie++.  
I have access to piix controllers only, so that was the only controller 
I changed.  I did not read the errata though... :(
Do you think the approach is unsafe, even if the piix tune routine is
serialized with a per-driver lock?  Bartlomiej?
