Hi,
Linux Kernel 2.2.1 on x86 platform handles SIGPIPE signal in a strange way, at
least different from Linux Kernel 2.0.xx, Solaris or FreeBSD. It does not emit
the SIGPIPE signal when the pipe dies, but rather when an application tries to
write data in it !
Is that a bug, or some new feature ;-) ?
Thanks in advance to take time en enlight me,
Best regards,
