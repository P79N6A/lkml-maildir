Looks like someone wanted to rename it, but forgot to include the new

The ip3106_uart.c file that was used in the PNX8550 boards is wrongly 
named. The uart just isn't an ip3106, because those are used in philips 
ARM based devices.
If you restore the ip3106T_uart.c, then please rename it pnx8550_uart.c 
(or pnx8xxxx_uart.c).
