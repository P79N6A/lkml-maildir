I had the same probelm on 2.2.11.ac3 -- I have an aic7xxx (Adaptec AIC-7880
Ultra) also but it took my machine about two days to get the "out of memory"
condition.  My machine didn't die completely -- it seemed to recover for the
most part -- but memory was "missing"  -- I couldn't account for all the
memory that showed used -- buffers+cached+free wasn't the "usual" number and
I didn't have any processes that showed excessive memory consumption.
I'm running 2.2.12-pre7 right now -- we'll see what happens.
P.S.  I've got another almost identical box (same hardware plus another
SCSI) which has been up for 4 days on 2.2.11.ac3 -- haven't seen the
behaviour yet.
