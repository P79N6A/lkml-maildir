Well, yes, but the problem: chips have onboard memory is generic.  The
proposed solution in the DMA API can't only work on certain platforms.

Right, that's rather the point.  The memory you get by doing an ioremap
on this chip area may have to be treated differently from real memory on
some platforms.
That's the fundamental problem of trying to treat it as memory obtained
from dma_alloc_coherent().
