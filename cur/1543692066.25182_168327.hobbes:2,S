This is a general file, and it is wrong to include architecture specific
knowledge here.
I recall that Roman Zippel introduced "enable" for exactly this purpose.
I looked into Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt but did not
see it documented - Roman?
Another comment about the naming of the config symbol.
We keep getting more config symbols controlling options to GCC.
A naming scheme like: CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE, CONFIG_CC_DEBUG_INFO
is preferable since it give better context information.
Let's start with this option, and rename the others later.
