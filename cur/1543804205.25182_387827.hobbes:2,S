James,
The patch in this lkml thread from Paul Mundt looks to extend
the lib/bitmap.c bitmap_find_free_region() and related
routines that you added in June 2004.  This current patch
extends this code to handle more than a page worth of bits.
I added the others to the CC list because they were on your CC
list on your patch:
    Subject: [PATCH] provide x86 implementation of on-chip coherent memory API
	    for DMA

Could you look Mundt's patch, and see if it looks ok?
Thanks.
