There are differences in how Nokia and Sharp are dealing with the Open 
Source communities. Nokia are openly saying they want to commit development 
work back to their respective projects where they can. Sharp were never 
interested in doing this. If Sharp had been interested in the community, 2.6 
kernels on the zaurus models would have happened long ago. As things stand, 
we have 2.6 on some models but its been a long slow haul with no interest on 
Sharp's part.
Whilst we don't yet know how far Nokia will go with this, everything I've 
heard leads me to remain optimistic.
