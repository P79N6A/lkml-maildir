For the transparent p2p bridge problem you mentioned, wouldn't you
be dealing with p2p bridges, and therefore expect the pci_bus
resource pointers to point to the corresponding pci_dev resources?
Or are you proposing to decouple pci_bus resource pointers from 
pci_dev completely? From quick code inspection, that seems to be
not too much trouble to increase from 4 then.
