Hello mm gurus,
In page_alloc.c, defined in /include/linux/mm.h, is this wonderful
global variable that I'd love to see from a driver module. Unfortunately,
even though it is global, it is somehow invisible. It becomes an undefined
symbol if I attempt to use it in my module.
If I am not supposed to use this, how do I prevent a driver from crashing
the system by eating up all the free pages?
The driver that I am implementing should not have a fixed amount of pages
that it can use because it should be able to use more if there is more
memory available and less if less. 
Presently, if I allocate pages to buffer an incomming data stream, and
using failure to obtain a free page as a throttle, it is way too late.
The machine will die a horrible death with out-of-memory errors for
everything including init. So I have to be able to check something
before I attempt to allocate another page.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
