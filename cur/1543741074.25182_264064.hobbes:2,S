Hi,
That looks to me like your HD is going to die sometime in the future...
>How bad is that for XFS?... The error isn't permanent it seems.
Usually nothing. Expect <any fs> to struggle when such IO/DMA errors happen.

XFS has probably picked up a malicious value due to the disk error, and as such
allocates that much. Probably more than you got.

If you reboot, and restart this repeated test, does it always error out at the
same time and spot (and with the same error 0x21/0x90), e.g. the 100'th
instance of xfs_db?
Please also try a badblocks -vv /dev/hdXY (or appropriate) repeatedly. If it
finds something there after a lot of runs (at least as much as you needed to
find out the fragmentation), there's definitely something wrong with the HD,
not XFS.
