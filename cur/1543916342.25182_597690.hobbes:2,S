Could you hit the Return/Enter key about every 70-72 characters or so,
to break up those long lines?
Thanks.

Someone was trying to be helpful in include/linux/mutex.h.
The real doc for the function is in kernel/mutex.c (and pasted
below).
Another convention is that we put kernel-doc with the implementation
(i.e., in .c files) when possible, not with the function prototype.
Of course, for inline functions or macros in header files, that's
where the kernel-doc has to live.
so we don't need this patch.
