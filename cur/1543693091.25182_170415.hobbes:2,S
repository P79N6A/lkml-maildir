These functions are called always with pages, where we know, that this
is RAM, AFICS. Since sometimes other things are encoded in the PTE, whe
check this via pfn_valid().
If I'm wrong about this the gurus from LINUX-MM should complain loudly.

I hope you are wrong about this, but I'm not totally sure. So I included
the linux-mm mailing list and Andrew Morton for expert advice.
