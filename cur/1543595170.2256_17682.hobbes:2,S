Neither is RMS, though; the license is the text of the GPL, not anything RMS
may have said about it since.

The modules are *not* "the kernel".  They are independent (except for header
files, but you didn't make that argument, and it's by no means certain to
hold up in court, especially if you don't use any code from the headers)
pieces of code that happen to interact with the kernel.  Why are modules,
from a legal standpoint, different from user programs?  And since when are
derivative works under copyright law determined by the opinion of the
copyright holder (much less any random third party that doesn't happen to be
a court), other than to be more lenient than the law requires?

Sure, they suck, but only for the users that choose to use them and the
providers of the modules that have to deal with the maintenance issues. 
What sucks even more, though, is someone else making the choice for them.

The only creepy thing here is the kernel being written in Forth; if you
don't want to run it in that binary-only implementation, find (or write) a
free one that will get the job done.  There's no need to get the courts and
lawyers involved, and no need to punish the users of the software by
restricting what they can do.
