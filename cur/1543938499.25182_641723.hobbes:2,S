hm, the IPI sending and receiving is nicely paired up:
[  625.795008] IPI (@smp_reschedule_interrupt) from task swapper:0 on CPU#1:
[  625.795223] IPI (@native_smp_send_reschedule) from task amarokapp:2882 on CPU#1:
amarokapp does wake up threads every 20 microseconds - that could 
explain it. It's probably Xorg running on one core, amarokapp on the 
other core. That's already 100 reschedules/sec.
