Ok, so 20 or so was a little off base. :) it's more like 3 packages that
are for my type of system and that appear to be activtly developed
1: SeLinux
2. Grsecurity
3. Lids
Lids, and grsecurity appear to be highly configureable and grsecurity
isn't playing nice with some applictions on my system. I'll be testing
out SeLinux and Lids tomarrow, but as one list memeber emailed me
ealier, LIDS has over 500 differnent options, That right there maybe a
turn off for sake of sanity right now. :)
