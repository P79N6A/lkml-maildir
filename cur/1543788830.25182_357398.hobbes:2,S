Two clear choices:
1) Switch to read-only and use the cached data to fulfil requests and
fail all others.
2) Ask the user to insert the media/plug the device back in (this is by
far the most likely cause of all requests suddenly failing) and then
continue where they left off.
It is unfortunate that Linux does not allow for 2) so you need to do 1).
I completely disagree with people who want the system to panic() or even
BUG() in such case.  I don't want "me accidentally knocking the
flashdrive attached to my keyboard's usb ports" to panic() my system
thank you very much!  And I don't want it to go BUG() either!
Best regards,
