That doesnt work if Im trying to keep the machine running slowly at low
power but still want the I/O to work. I guess its fudgeable however and
the battery policy is enough info.

It tops out at about 300Mhz. Life gets excessively interesting because
about half the I/O on the Geode is imaginary and caused by SMM traps.
When power saving you normally set the geode to run slowly but spike
hard to full power when faking hardware. WIthout that some stuff like
the SB emulation doesnt work very well.
