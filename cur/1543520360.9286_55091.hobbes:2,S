actually, khttpd does get around one limitation currently inherent inside 
linux --
and that is that there is no mechanism for zero-copy.
a user-space application needs to read() from kernel-to-user on a socket, 
then write() user-to-kernel back.
2 x memory-copies.
i'm currently working on this; i have a _real_ application that cannot push 
more than 320 mbit/sec to/from the network (on gig-E).
its called too-many-copies and a 133mhz FSB.
we're exceeding performance levels that i suspect either of khttpd or 
phttpd have been benchmarked to.  (ie. phttpd is mostly showing the 
benefits of async-i/o-event-notification.  even it will be limited by 
copies in the long-run).
cheers,
lincoln.
PS. rather than bitching and moaning about it, yes, i am working on a 
fix.  the way i'm doing it is a new character device driver which allows 
user-space to mmap() into physical ram.  maybe not pretty, maybe not 
acceptable to the l-k folk, but it will certainly get us out of a current 
ceiling limitation.
