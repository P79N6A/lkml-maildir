If you upgrade the server and read "Changes", then a note in changes might
say that "you need to configure carefully or some clients could get in trouble."
(If the current "Changes" don't have that - post a documentation patch.)
If you use a distro, then hopefully the distro takes care of the
problem for you.  Or at least brings it to your attention somehow.
It should not come as a surprise that changing a server might have an
effect on the clients - clients and servers are connected after all!
