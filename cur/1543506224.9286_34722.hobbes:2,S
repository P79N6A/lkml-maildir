Subject: 12M only showing as 10M?

I just put a 4Mb stick into a 486 that had 8M previously, and now
has 12M total, however meminfo shows that the total memory is
now: 10649600, but that 12050432 is shared.  What could cause
this to happen, and why is 12M not showing up?  Could it be
something in the machine's BIOS?
[root@gw /root]# cat /proc/meminfo
