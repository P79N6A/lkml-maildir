I'd recommend looking at LKCD (Linux Kernel Crash Dumps).  We are currently
finishing up the 2.3/2.4 port (which will work on devices that support
kiobufs, and will be a loadable module, and might end up being backported
to 2.2 at this stage).  You can get the latest code base from the CVS tree:
	
https://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=2726
... the base SourceForge LKCD effort is found at:
	
https://sourceforge.net/projects/lkcd/
... and the main web page for LKCD is at:
	
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/lkcd/
We're also trying to finish up an Alpha port, and we're working on an
IA64 version.  If you have any questions about this effort, send me an
E-mail, and I'll be glad to help out.

P.S.  I'll try to release a patch in the next couple of days ... it'll
      be against 2.3.99-pre9 for now ...
