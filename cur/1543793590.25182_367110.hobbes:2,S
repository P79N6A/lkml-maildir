well ......
in 2.4 kernels you had a 4K stack as well (even though it was 8Kb in
size, you lost 1.5Kb to the task struct and you lost 2 to 2.5 Kb to irq
context, net usable was 4Kb). In 2.6 the task struct moved off the
stack, and the 4KSTACK feature allowed you to split the irq stack usage
off to a seperate stack, still giving you 4Kb available.. that's still
the same as 2.4 effectively. 2.6 also has (and I wish it becomes "had"
soon) an option to get 6Kb effective stack space instead. This is an
increase of 2Kb compared to 2.4.
