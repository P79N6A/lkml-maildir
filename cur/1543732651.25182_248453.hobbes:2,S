You are, but don't worry.  You aren't the only one.  (Before I get
assaulted for this, let me say that there are people on this list
smarter than me and I miss concept chunks quite frequently.)

You want simplicity?  How does this strike you:
	scp file/serialize daemon@bsd:~/file.img
You don't have to worry about "file is not a file".  You don't have to
worry about fifos or device nodes.  You don't have to worry about files
in files.  In fact, you don't have to worry about any new kind of file
added, ever.

The use of ext3 as a filesystem isn't cross-platform.  Every disk-write
is platform-specific!  We should all be using captive-ntfs instead!
Seriously, this isn't hard -- it's called a "library".  And anything as
bloated as OO.org has got to already be modular enough to add this sort
of thing.

If that was so, OO.org wouldn't use a GUI, because that isn't
cross-platform.  They'd use a purely commandline interface, because that
is universal.
