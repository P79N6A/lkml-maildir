Precommit basically just asks the application to die when it first allocates 
memory if it's even possible for it to die in the most pathlogical usage case 
of that memory.
I.E. "die up front" instead of "die while running".  (There's no possible way 
this can improve performance.  If you want to never swap, just don't mount a 
swap partition.)  You don't even have to change the VM's behavior, it can 
still copy on write and such.  You just add a test to cause allocations to 
fail unnecessarily at times.
Throwing in a little extra code on mmaps and allocations to kill a process 
wouldn't be too hard.  It would be stupid outside of something like a 
financial transaction system (and probably even in there), but it technically 
shouldn't be all that hard to do.
Unless I missed something...?
