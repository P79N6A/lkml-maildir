Yeah, that works pretty well, but there's more we can debate about.  :)
(a) Are "normal" and "canonical" necessarily equivalent?  They certainly 
aren't in Psychiatry.
(b) Are people going to know what we're talking about when we say 
"normalize" as well as they do when they see "canonicalize".
As a person who enjoyed studying Linguistics and hated studying English, 
I prefer to take the liberal (descriptive, rather than prescriptive) 
stance and vote in favor of the use of the word "canonilcalize".  But 
the debate isn't over, and I'm willing to change my opinion (not that it 
really matters...).
