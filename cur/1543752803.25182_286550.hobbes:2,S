This isn't new to 2.6.11-rc1-mm1, but it has the infamous (to Fedora
users) "ACPI shutdown bug" -- poweroff hangs instead of actually turning
the computer off, on some computers. Here's the RH Bugzilla report where
most of the discussion took place:

In the Fedora kernels it turned out to be due to kexec. I'll see if I
can narrow it down further.
