The 'String of oopses' was a red herring.  It was fixed sometime in early
January.  The PANIC: INIT: problem, however, is real, and was introduced
by the following ChangeSet on January 7:
D 1.972 03/01/07 10:08:55-08:00 torvalds@home.transmeta.com 15824 15815 2/0/1
P ChangeSet
C Move x86 signal handler return stub to the vsyscall page,
C and stop honoring the SA_RESTORER information.
C 
C This will prepare us for alternate signal handler returns.
If I build a kernel WITH this changeset it fails; if I build a kernel
at 1.971 (bjorn_helgaas's i810/i830 AGP patches) the kernel works just
fine.
So, something in your changes to kernel/sysenter.c or kernel/signal.c
causes INIT to PANIC and fail.
So, what would you like me to test, now?
