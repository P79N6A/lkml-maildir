That not a problem - it's a feature. In such a
situation the person would get a general file creation
error. Although it isn't likely people would structure
files with invisible files in directories that the
user has create permissions it is logical that if I
put a file in a place where the user has no rights I
want it to stay there. Currently the user can delete
files where they have no rights.
I might also want to restrict the kind of a user can
createor give permission to create only certian file
names.
/etc/vz/conf/*.conf - create - readonly - self-rw
/etc/vz/conf - deny 
This would allow the user to read all *.conf files,
create new *.conf files, and full permissions to
read/write/delete files that the user created but not
files that others created. If listing a directory then
only the *.conf files would appear even if other files
are in the directory.
