The error also happens in 2.6.19, same as in 2.6.18. I
extracted this from syslog:
Apr 17 00:14:08 kdev kernel: loop: loaded (max 8 devices)
Apr 17 00:14:15 kdev kernel: UFS-fs error (device loop0): ufs_check_page: bad entry in directory #2: directory entry across blocks - offset=356, rec_len=668, name_len=19
