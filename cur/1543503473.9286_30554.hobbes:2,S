You are *defintely* WRONG ! - Believe me.
Best is, to debug those programs which are not releasing the "shared memory
and other IPC stuff, producing *amazingly* zombies". - Or to switch to applications
which don't behave this way.
Any program not freeing it's shared memory when exiting (not important for which
reason, whatsoever) is IMHO *broken*.- Same goes for zombie-producers.
If you are suffering from such stuff - go and fix it!!!
This will dave a lot of your time and nerves.
Rebooting is *definitely* NO SOLUTION at all. - You may call it a bad habit from
Micro$oft-infested sysadmins, or in the best case, it's a minor and dumb workaround,
but is IN NO WAY a SOLUTION, since it SOLVES _nothing_.

OK. So there you have it. - Linux' automounter has to become more stable and
as you say not as good configurable as Suns automount. - This is a point where
Linux can improve. - Go and tell or better help the people who work on that!
I'm working here with 800+ Userworkstations (Sun's), not counting the servers...

Great to hear this! :-)))))  Keep up this intention!
A really smooth runnning network really satisfy you, when you can reach this.
Try to make everything "automagically" working. - When you have cronjobs which
send mails, set up a filter which starts the matching counter measures.
Write lots of cronjobs and atjobs. - This will keep a lot of problems away from
you. And this will save you a lot of time which you can spend for more interesting
and important stuff.

The first time Microsoft makes something that doesn't suck, is when
they start making vacuum cleaners.
