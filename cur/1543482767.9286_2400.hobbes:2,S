hmm - errno = 8 indicates that the executable's magic number is incorrect.
Quite odd

And the fork fails with what looks like a memory error.
Couple of suggestions.  First, compile a non-module kernel, delete all of
the kernel modules and try booting with that.  That'll show if there's
some basic problem like too little memory (how much memory do you have),
or if there's a basic problem with the fork and execve code.
Second, I find it rather odd that it's requesting a binfmt module when
does this occur (before or after init is started?, what exact point in
bootup?).  Consider making all of the executable supports (a.out, elf, and
misc) compiled into the kernel.  Try making a modular kernel without kmod.
You _are_ compiling ELF support into the kernel, right?
Good luck,
