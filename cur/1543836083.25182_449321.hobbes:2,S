Hi,
I'm transferring data using DMA from a custom PCI device memory into
RAM.  Can someone advise me on the correct buffer synchronisation
strategy for the following 3 scenarios:
Assuming I have three buffers, buf_A, and buf_B, both created using
dma_alloc_noncoherent(NULL, 32 * PAGE_SIZE, ...), and buf_C (much
larger), remapped into the processor's virtual address space using
ioremap(), and 'n' is the number of bytes to copy using DMA channel
'dmanr', ...
1/. DMA copy from PCI device memory into buf_B:
   /* ...prepare DMA engine, then: */
   WARN_ON(buf_B != L1_CACHE_ALIGN(buf_B));
   dma_sync_single_range_for_device(NULL, buf_B, 0, n, DMA_FROM_DEVICE);
   mv64x6x_enable_dma(dmanr);
   wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout(...)
   dma_sync_single_range_for_cpu(NULL, buf_B, 0, n, DMA_FROM_DEVICE);
2/. DMA copy from buf_A to buf_B 
    (same as above, except now sync the src buffer prior to DMA):
   /* ...prepare DMA engine, check buffer alignment (x2), then: */
   dma_sync_single_range_for_device(NULL, buf_A,  0, n, DMA_TO_DEVICE);
   dma_sync_single_range_for_device(NULL, buf_B, 0, n, DMA_FROM_DEVICE);
   mv64x6x_enable_dma(dmanr);
   wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout(...)
   dma_sync_single_range_for_cpu(NULL, buf_B, 0, n, DMA_FROM_DEVICE);
3/. DMA from PCI device memory into ioremap()'ed buffer, buf_C:
   /* ...prepare DMA engine, check buffer alignment, then: */
   /* No buffer sync-ing is required? */
   mv64x6x_enable_dma(dmanr);
   wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout(...)
   /* No buffer sync'ing is required? */
Will this approach work (particularly case 3/.)?  I tried dma_sync-ing
the region, but got an 'oops' (kernel access of bad area(?)).
I'm using the 2.6.16 kernel (compiled with CONFIG_NOT_COHERENT_CACHE
defined) on an Artesyn PmPPC7448 processor.  The processor utilises its
Marvell MV64460 as the DMA controller for the transaction.  
Thanks,
