Look through the drivers and check upon "kernel_thread()". This shares
the process context of 'init' so you can do a lot of "user-mode" things
in the kernel. But.... beware.... User mode stuff should be done in
user-mode, not in the kernel.

    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
