260-test2-vanilla works fine with a little stutter playing the avis
260-test2-O10 causes horrible stutter and loss of input to system
260-test2-mm1 causes horrible stutter and loss of input to system
NOTE: Instead of re-setting, by switching consoles by pressing Alt F7 
then Alt-F1 back and forth (ie from X to virtual console) it seems I 
could prod wine+galciv into edging forward, stalling, edging forward 
etc. through the opening AVIs. ie. I would hear the sounds of the movie 
advance each time  I switched into Alt-F1.
Once into the turn-based game itself (after opening animations) ability 
to input was restored again and the game can be played and windows moved 
around etc.
So it seems the playing of the little movies is what really locks up the 
whole system using the O10/mm1 scheduling???
