What HAL version do you think Debian ought to have, pray tell? And
what the hell version do those other distros have?
The last HAL release was 0.5.8 on 11-Sep-2006. It showed up in
Debian/unstable on 2-Oct. There have been six Debian bugfix releases,
the most recent on 12-Feb.

The last NetworkManager is 0.6.4 released 13-Jul-2006. It showed up in
Debian/unstable on 8-Aug. There have been five bugfix releases, the
most recent on 30-Nov.

Debian is NOT the problem.
