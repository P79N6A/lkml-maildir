That is the idea. I would like to even simplify the fbcon/dev even
more in this model and remove all in-kernel acceleration in fbdev. 
The user space console would be fully accelerated using DRM. If we
aren't using fbcon for normal console then it doesn't need to be
accelerated and that source of conflicts can be removed. fbcon would
be used for system recovery, OOPs, boot, kdbg, etc only kernel use, no
normal logins.
