VMS had a lot going for it.. except company support (it was overpriced).
The VMS filesystem only allowed one link to a file. If a second occured,
then it was listed as an error. The central database assumed that the
only path to a program was the one it was registered with. Now if it used
the inode, maybe. But what about mountable file systems. If a mount point
moved, does that mean the registry also changed? VMS didn't allow privleged
programs to reside anywhere except the system disk. If this were acceptable
then my idea of a file on each filesystem containing a table of known
capability lists (indexed by device:inode) would work. If you wanted to
eliminate most of the searching, then change the inode to contain the index
of the cpability file to the capability corresponding to the inode. If the
index is zero, then no lookup is required. If nonzero then it is the
index to the capability list for that inode.
This would also allow for "shared" capability lists where the administrator
could change the capability list for all programs that used a particular
index value on the filesystem. It also cuts down on the inode load by
using an unsigned byte or short integer for storing the index. A byte would
allow for a maximum of 255 different capability lists, a short 32765.
There really shouldn't be 32K privileged programs, and I suspect that 255
would be sufficient.
