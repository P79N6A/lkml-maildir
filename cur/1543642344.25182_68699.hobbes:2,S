Right - let me rephrase.  Tasks which are either:
  - untraced, normal
  - traced, but traced _by their parent_
are on the sibling/children list.
Tasks which are traced by some not-my-parent process go on the
ptrace_children list.  So I think we agree.

Great.  I'm not exactly sure on how this works right now: sys_wait4
only iterates over ->children, with the exception of the special code
in TASK_ZOMBIE.  I'm not quite sure when events from a traced process
get to the normal parent of that process, or when they're supposed to.
