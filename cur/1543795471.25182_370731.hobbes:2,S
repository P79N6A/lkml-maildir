well, more or less the same but not _exactly_ the same ;-)
I already have a big patch against 2.6.15-rc2-git5:
[ 
http://perso.wanadoo.es/xose_vp/documentation_cleanup_01.diff.bz2
 ]
main features:
- move all drivers_info into 'drivers'
- move all arch_info into 'arch'
- move all drivers_info from 'net' to 'drivers/net'
TODO:
- clean up the 'Documentation' root dir a bit more (easy)
- remove (easy) or update all INDEX files (tedious)
- move all info/text files from source code to 'Documentation' dir (tedious)
- verify all files are in the correct place (tedious)
enough for now.
-thanks-
