Subject: mkinitrd errors...
Hello.
I have a need to have some drivers pre-loaded before the scsi adapter driver
is loaded.
I followed the usage and i got some errors which iam attaching below in this
mail.
If someone can give me a way to get this to work that would be awesome!!!
please reply back to me..
1. Is the size of the ramdisk limited? if so to what, and how can we
increase the size of the ramdisk created?
