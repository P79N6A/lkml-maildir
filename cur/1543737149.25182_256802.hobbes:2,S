When I include patches inline in mails I use pine's "Read File" 
functionality. Pressing CTRL+R and then specifying a filename causes pine 
to read the file and place it inline exactely as read from the file. So no 
whitespace damage by cut'n'paste. 
I don't know, but I would suspect that other mailers would have similar 
functionality.??

That would be just as fine as plain inline, but I think it'll be difficult 
to find a way to do that that works universally with all mailers.
