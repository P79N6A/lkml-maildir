ok, I see. But then why not using the logical number by default, that

you're writing this tag in the textual log anyways, wouldn't it only
move the too big space from one place to another? I'm saying this
because cvs just provides a means of diffing a tag against another, and
so it looks more efficient (especially in term of saving bandwidth from
your part) to use the cvs feature, rather than doing it by hand with
multiple transfers.
