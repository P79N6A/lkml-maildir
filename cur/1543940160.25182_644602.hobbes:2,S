agreed, by looking at my top output (and not the nfs code) it looks like
it just spawns a configurable number of active kernel threads which are
not cpu bound by in any way. I think just removing the isolated cpus
from their runnable mask should take care of them.

I'm in favour of better engineered method, that is, we really should try
to solve these problems in a proper way. Hacks like this might be fine
for custom kernels, but I think we should have a higher standard when it
comes to upstream - we all have to live many years with whatever we put
in there, we'd better think well about it.
