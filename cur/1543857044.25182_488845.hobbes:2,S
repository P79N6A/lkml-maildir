I've used OABI-compat + EABI ARM kernels to routinely switch between
OABI and EABI rootfs boots. There were some minor busybox issues
on the OABI-compat side (w.r.t. syscalls), but nothing major. These
were fairly complex applications, so "it should work" (and IIRC the
patches were publicly available). But I'm sure I'm forgetting some
significant detail and can't go check right now.
