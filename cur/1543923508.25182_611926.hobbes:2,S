But visibility always comes with creation or deletion of attributes?
Perhaps what we want is to move knowledge of the attributes to the
kobject (when attributes are created/deleted), while we decide on
visibilty of the attributes (creation/deletion of sysfs entries) based
on a filter (where visibility may change, while the attribute still
exists).
