Subject: [PATCH 0/2] xfs: only use refcounted pages for I/O

Many block drivers (aoe, iscsi) really want refcountable pages in
bios, which is what almost everyone send down.  XFS unfortunately
has a few places where it sends down buffers that may come from
kmalloc, which breaks them.  The patches in this series fix this
issue up.
