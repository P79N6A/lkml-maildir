How about just write a driver that responds to the interrupt, and write
a program that does a blocking read from the driver. The driver read
routine stuff the program on a wait queue... until... interrupt occurs,
wake up the program, program does exec(/sbin/halt) ?
This could actually be made into a good demonstration of driver
programming in that you could hook the parport interrupt and do it with
any PC....
