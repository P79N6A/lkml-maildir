it's a different coding style, but otherwise i find glibc highly 
readable and well-maintained. It is also a more mature piece of code 
than say the kernel, e.g. API-wise, so we could indeed learn a few 
things. Just consider the fact that glibc has 10 times more APIs than 
the kernel, and still it is breaking apps less often than the kernel.  
But i digress :-)
