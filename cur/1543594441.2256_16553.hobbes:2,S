I've just tested with Intel's epro-1.6.6 driver, and it does work (the
full bonanza works; simultaneous netperf and ftp and whatnot run with no
errors or hangs). This makes my situation a bit easier (and my head a bit
less confused, specially with Andrey pointing out the different versions
to the driver).
I am _very_ willing to devote some time to getting this fixed in both the
kernel and Donald's drivers if anyone is interested in tracking down the
problem. I'm not very familiar with the hardware, but I have a test box I
can use freely, a bit of time spare, and I can reproduce the problem
easily. I'd hate to see somebody else go through what I have just had to,
so it would be nice to see this fixed or documented in an official-ese
place.
Take care,
