PCI: Disabling Via external APIC routing
Curiously, this line appears in 2.6.3, but not in 2.6.7 or 2.6.9 dmesg
-- even though all the configs build in IOAPIC support.
Can you forward the /proc/interrupts from 2.6.3, and from 2.6.9 with and
without acpi=off?  do you see a significant change in /proc/interrupts
before and after the sensor-provoked slowness starts?
if you build 2.6.9 w/o the CONFIG_ACPI_PROCESSOR and boot w/o cmdline
params, do you still see slowness?
if you boot 2.6.9 with these parameters, do you see any additional dmesg
lines?
