You should be able to do this successfully with nfs-utils 1.1 or
later.  Where does the manual say you cannot - we should fix that.

It is best not to use nohide - we should probably mark it as
'legacy'.
Simply export the top level mountpoint as 'crossmnt'  and everything
below there will be exported.

crossmnt goes at the top.  nohide goes in the submount.  Both have
the same general effect though with subtle differences.
You don't need both (though that doesn't hurt).
Just use crossmnt at the top,  Then you don't need to mention the
lower level filesystems at all.

All of this should work fine with v3.  Once you have the right patch
for the crossmnt bug applied, if you have further problems post them
to linux-nfs@vger.kernel.org.
