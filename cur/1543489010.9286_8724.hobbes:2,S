Hello,
"lp%d on fire!\n" is one of my favorite Linux printk's. :)  However, seeing
as it indicates a not-uncommon problem with a non-critical external
peripheral (the printer) and poses no significant concern, I think the
priority should be changed from KERN_ERR to KERN_INFO.

Totally trivial, but... better to have the message only appear in your logs
than in all your terminals and wake your monitor from powersave (assuming
typical sane syslog configuration). :)
cheers,
