I *really* think you need to do some searches on this list to verify
this statement.
Let me summarize what I remember from past discussions of this nature.
Linus put his code under the GPL.  Contributions came in, under the same
license.  At some point, the first binary only module showed up.  When
asked about the legality, Linus said something to the effect of, "I
think they're ok."
Note the lack of clarification from the other (miriad) copyright
holders?
In summary - If you want to write binary only modules, you need to talk
to a lawyer that understands the issues involved.  "Linus said they were
ok" doesn't even begin to encompass the number of copyright holders
involved.
