Yes, that's the easier approach if you don't have any detection
of error in the kernel itself. If the kernel already does all
the work for figuring out that something has gone wrong, it may
as well use this to reduce the noise.

Let's just hope reordering stays dead :-)
There's still a bit of magic in loss recovery, because you need
something that triggers loss recovery, after the loss has
happened. That can of course just be whatever else happens to
come along (or the user getting impatient), or a periodic scan.
