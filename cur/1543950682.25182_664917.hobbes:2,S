I think you meant something like

Doesn't this mean that cgroup_disable=cpu will disable whichever comes
first out of cpuset, cpuacct or cpu in the subsystem list?
I suggest just sticking with the original simpler version that
required separate cgroup_disabled=foo options for each system that you
want to disable.
