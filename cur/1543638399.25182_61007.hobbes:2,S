There are a number of interfaces that need expansion in 2.5.  Telldir 
and seekdir would be much better if they took as argument some 
filesystem specific opaque cookie (e.g. filename). Using a byte offset 
to reference a directory entry that was found with a filename is an 
implementation specific artifact that obviously only works for a 
ufs/s5fs/ext2 type of filesystem, and is just wrong.
4 billion files is not enough to store the government's XML databases in.
