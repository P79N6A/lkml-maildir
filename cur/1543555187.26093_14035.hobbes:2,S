I tried using the kernel thread as demonstrated in your example and again it
failed (panic - scheduling in interrupt).
The difference is that your code executes the thread from within dev->open,
while my code tries to do that from dev->do_ioctl that has spinlocks around
the entire operation (which apparently sleeps).
If I comment out the spin_lock/unlock it will succeed, but then I can't be
sure I don't get any concurrent Tx/Rx/timer which is a bad idea while the
topology is still being created.
is there any way to do something like firing threads/timers atomically ?
	Thanks,

Attached is an example.  My "8139too" ethernet driver uses a kernel
thread instead of a timer to perform media checking.  It illustrates how
to start and stop a kernel thread.
