There are a lot of numbers there - what do they tell us?

So what has changed here?  From a quick look it appears that x86_64 is
using get_zeroed_page() for ptes, puds and pmds and is using a custom
quicklist for pgds.
After your patches, x86_64 is using a common quicklist allocator for puds,
pmds and pgds and continues to use get_zeroed_page() for ptes.
Or something totally different, dunno.  I tire.
My question is pretty simple: how do we justify the retention of this
custom allocator?
Because simply removing it is the preferable way of fixing the SLUB
problem.
