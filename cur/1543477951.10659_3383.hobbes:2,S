I don't recall seeing this before with 2.0.x, but I may not have
looked carefully (we have a lot of Solaris and Sun servers here).  I
am having the problem that the NFS mounted file systems suddenly
become inaccessible (I should send a formal bug report on this).  I
thought that the nfs_stat_to_errno was to blame.  What are you using
to mount file systems?  Do you have autofs built in the kernel (I
eventually turned this off)?  Actually, do you know if autofs can
handle the Sun NIS maps?
        Thanks in advance for any info,
                -Fred
