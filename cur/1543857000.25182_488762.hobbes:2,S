Actually, I was referring to something a little bit different. For example 
kernel/mutex.c:__mutex_lock_common() calls spin_lock_mutex() on line 132. 
spin_lock_mutex() contains
                DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(in_interrupt());    \
                local_irq_save(flags);                  \
                __raw_spin_lock(&(lock)->raw_lock);     \
                DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(l->magic != l);     \
When one of these two WARN_ONs trigger, we get only
	WARNING at kernel/mutex.c:132 __mutex_lock_common()
but it's indistuingishable which of the two WARN_ONs triggered. My patch 
turns this into
	WARNING (l->magic != l) at kernel/mutex.c:132 __mutex_lock_common()

I absolutely don't insist on it to be merged, besides this Andrew also 
pointed out non-trivial .text growth. I just cooked it up for myself when 
debugging some locking problems and that warning at kernel/mutex.c:132 
triggered, and I didn't know which one was the reason.
