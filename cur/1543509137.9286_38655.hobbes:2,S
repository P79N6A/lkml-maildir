For completeness, here are two additional tests:
First, I built an eight disk raid0 set, using all of the 9 drives from the
previously mentioned raid0 set, except for the disk that resides on the
hpt-366 controller:

Second, I rebuilt the original raid5 set, using the same nine drives and
cables, but only attached to the PDC & PIIX4 controllers, no disk connected
to the HPT-366

I'm pretty sure that should rule out a faulty disk or cable.
