Perhaps you want some kind of extension to "renice" to allow a running process 
to be have its percent chopped back then?  (Without necessarily affecting the 
global reserve?)
Shouldn't require root, just require running as the same user as the process.  
(if you can 'kill -SIGSTOP" a task, you should be able to reduce its 
priority...)
