If you are on debian i have noticed recently that gnomevfs (on unstable) 
requires famd. famd will open /cdrom after it is mounted and run a dir 
notification on it. now i think famd needs some fixing, firstly to not 
bother running dir notice on ro filesystems, and secondly allow an 
authorised user (other than the original program (in this case 
nautilus)) to drop specific mount point dirs from the notification list. 
so yes this is a userland problem as far as i can see.
