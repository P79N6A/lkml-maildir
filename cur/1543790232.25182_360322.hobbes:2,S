Subject: [PATCH 4/6] x86_64: fix L1_CACHE_SHIFT_MAX for Intel EM64T [for 2.6.14?]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade@yahoo.it>
The current value was correct before the introduction of Intel EM64T support -
but now L1_CACHE_SHIFT_MAX can be less than L1_CACHE_SHIFT, which _is_ funny!
Between the few users of ____cacheline_maxaligned_in_smp, we also have (for
example) rcu_ctrlblk, and struct zone, with zone->{lru_,}lock. I.e. we have a
lot of excess cacheline bouncing on them.
No correctness issues, obviously. So this could even be merged for 2.6.14 (I'm
not a fan of this idea, though).
