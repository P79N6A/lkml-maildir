Subject: Unresolved symbol in linux-2.4.0-test3-pre2

I compiled linux-2.4.0-test3-pre2 with (among other)
eepro100, tulip, ipchains, ip_conntrack and parport
as modules. All of these fail to load because of a
unresolved symbol: timer_sequence
timer_sequence is defined in kernel/timer.c. I tried
adding an EXPORT_SYMBOL(timer_sequence); in timer.c,
but that doesn't do the trick...
What else can I try -- or what info can I post to help
someone fix this?
Thanks. Willem Riede.
