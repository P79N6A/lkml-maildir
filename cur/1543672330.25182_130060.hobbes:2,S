   How about we leave kmalloc_per_cpu as-is (it uses kmalloc()), and
   only apply Rusty's new code to DEFINE_PER_CPU?
I propose to make it use kmalloc() all the time.
It simply doesn't make sense to use a pool given what you've
shown me.  If we've decided that any limit whatsover is bad,
why impose any limit at all?  Smells like bad design frankly.
Normal DEFINE_PER_CPU() need not a pool, therefore we don't need
a pool for anything.
Make kmalloc_per_cpu() merely a convenience macro, made up of existing
non-percpu primitives.
