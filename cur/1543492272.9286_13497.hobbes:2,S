Someone sent you a ICMP redirect for these IPs. The kernel installed
a temporary route for it. Because these hosts didn't answer it concludes
after some time that the redirect was bad and removes the temporary route.
If it bothers you feel free to comment it out, but it would be better to 
fix the routing so that no ICMP redirect is needed.
