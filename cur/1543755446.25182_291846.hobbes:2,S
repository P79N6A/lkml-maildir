This is great, thanks for doing this.  I've applied all of these patches
to my trees, and they'll show up in the next -mm release.
Hm, that class_simple interface is looking like the way we should move
toward, as it's "simple" to use, instead of the more complex class code.
I'll have to look at migrating more code to use it over time, or move
that interface back into the class code itself...
thanks,
