How can this work, if the device only respects the lower 24 bit of the
address it is given? If it sets up a DMA cycle at that address,
whereas system memory as seen from the bus starts at say 1GB, then the
behavior of the machine is unspecified: it may reject the cycle (I
guess, need to check PCI docs for that) or allow the DMA data to go
somewhere random - hopefully just into blue air.
In this situation we simply have to say this device does not work in
this box and not allow it to be initialized.

Hmmm, there are several devices out there that will only do 24bit,
30bit and 31bit DMA respectively - we need a generic solution I think.
