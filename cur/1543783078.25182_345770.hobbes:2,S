Where did this 14.5% come from?  Is it bit_putcs alone or is more
real world, such as 'time cat text_file'? If I'm to guess, a large
percent of the improvement is caused by the inlining of the code.
I'm not against the patch, it will benefit drivers with very fast
imageblits.  However, since most drivers have imageblits done in software,
a large proportion of the processing time will go to the imageblit itself,
so I don't think you'll get that high a number (I get only a 4%
improvement, and this is in a driver with accelerated blits, and it will
probably be lower, ie, in vesafb).
Anyway, with the addition of your patch, bit_putcs has now reached an
'ugliness threshhold' for a revamp.
