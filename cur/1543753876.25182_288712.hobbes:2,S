Hi,
ide-dev-2.6 tree has been resurrected.  It now contains first bunch
of fixes needed for converting IDE device drivers to driver-model.
NOTE: If you have a local copy of the tree please re-clone it, thanks.

   [ide] kill ide_driver_t->pre_reset
   
   Add ide_drive_t->post_reset flag and use it to signal post reset
   condition to the ide-tape driver (the only user of ->pre_reset).
<bzolnier@trik.(none)> (05/01/21 1.2141)
   [ide] fix some rare ide-default vs ide-disk races
   
   Some rare races between ide-default and ide-disk are possible, i.e.:
   * ide-default is used, I/O request is triggered (ie. /proc/ide/hd?/identify),
     drive->special is cleared silently (so CHS is not initialized properly),
     ide-disk is loaded and fails if drive uses CHS
   * ide-disk is used, drive is resetted, ide-disk is unloaded, ide-default
     takes control over drive and on the first I/O request silently clears
    drive->special without restoring settings
   
   Fix them by moving idedisk_{special,pre_reset}() and company to IDE core.
<bzolnier@trik.(none)> (05/01/21 1.2140)
   [ide] generic Power Management for IDE devices
   
   Move PM code from ide-cd.c and ide-disk.c to IDE core so:
   * PM is supported for other ATAPI devices (floppy, tape)
   * PM is supported even if specific driver is not loaded
<bzolnier@trik.(none)> (05/01/21 1.2139)
   [ide] fix drive->ready_stat for ATAPI
   
   ATAPI devices ignore DRDY bit so drive->ready_stat must be set to zero.
   It is currently done by device drivers (including ide-default fake driver)
   but for PMAC driver it is too late as wait_for_ready() may be called during
   probe: probe_hwif()->pmac_ide_dma_check()->pmac_ide_{mdma,udma}_enable()->
   ->pmac_ide_do_setfeature()->wait_for_ready().
   
   Fixup drive->ready_stat just after detecting ATAPI device.
<bzolnier@trik.(none)> (05/01/21 1.2138)
   [ide] ignore BIOS enable bits for Promise controllers
   
   Since there are no Promise binary drivers for 2.6.x kernels:
   * ignore BIOS enable bits completely
   * remove CONFIG_PDC202XX_FORCE
   * kill IDEPCI_FLAG_FORCE_PDC hack
