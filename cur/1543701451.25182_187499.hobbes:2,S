Ick.  You realize how many hotplug events we spit out already today?
This would be a huge bottleneck.
It's not that tough to just see if the file you are looking is there,
and if not sleep.  If after an ammount of time the file still isn't
there, just give up.
Also, not all hotplug scripts care about sysfs files being present :)
