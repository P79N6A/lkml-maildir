I don't think that's, um, "possible."  Even if you could discover how many
empty sockets there were in a system, someone might be able to hotplug
a board with more of them on it.  And there's no way to tell how many CPUs
to reserve for each socket anyway, e.g. AMD has already announced quad-core
processors.
But what really surprised me is that for_each_cpu() actually walks
cpu_possible_map and not cpu_present_map as I had assumed.  This violates
the Principle Of Least Surprise.  Maybe renaming for_each_cpu to
for_each_possible_cpu might be a good idea?
