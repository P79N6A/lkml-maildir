Not really.  I have two files generated in sequence:
  .c at 08:12:23.1
  .o at 08:12:23.2
As long as the .o stays more recent than the .c, everything is fine.
With the current code, this breaks if the .o file is flushed and
re-read, while the .c file stays in cache:
  .c at 08:12:23.1
  .o at 08:12:23.0  (oops, suddenly in need of rebuild)
With your suggested change, it will break if the .c file is flushed
while the .o file stays in cache (as Daniel pointed out):
  .c at 08:12:24.0
  .o at 08:12:23.1  (oops, suddenly in need of rebuild)
Both lead to the same type of problem.
Bye,
Ulrich
