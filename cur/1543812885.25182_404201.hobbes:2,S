That's why I hedged my words with "according to ..." :-)
But on most arches those accesses do indeed seem to happen in-order.  On
i386 and x86_64, it's a natural consequence of program store ordering.
On at least some other arches, there are explicit memory barriers in the
implementation of the access macros to force this ordering to occur.
