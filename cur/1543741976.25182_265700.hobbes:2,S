Subject: [PATCH] Fix e100 suspend/resume w/ 2.6.10-rc1 and above (due to pci_save_state change)

Hi,
Recent 2.6.10-rc1 merged the pci_save_state change. This prevents some
drivers from working with suspend/resume. The reason is the
pci_save_state() called in driver's ->suspend doesn't take effect any more,
since pci bus ->suspend will override it. And the two states might be
different in some drivers, i.e. e100. I don't know if there are other
drivers also suffer from it.
Thanks,
-yi
