Also, I think there is a possibility of only enabling boot devices for ACPI
S4.  However, for the reboot case, we're not restoring anything.  Instead new
resource assignments are being made.  Doesn't the PCI subsystem already
handle this?

Agreed.

Couldn't this be in pci_restore_state() instead?  I was thinking it would
(in part) replace the ugly dword reads we have now.  They include many
registers we don't need to touch.  I wonder if we'll need pci_save_state()
at all or if we can derive all the information from the pci_dev.  I'll have
to look into it further.
Also we need a way to restore specific PCI capabilities.
Thanks,
Adam
