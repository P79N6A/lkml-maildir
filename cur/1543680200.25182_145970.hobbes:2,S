Hi
I'm building chrooted environment for users and I'm using mount --bind
<what> <where> -scheme to mount some important directories for the user.
This works fine for couple users but what is the limit for binding
directories to show up on a different place? I tried googling but
couldn't find any direct answers.
Thanks,
Jarmo
