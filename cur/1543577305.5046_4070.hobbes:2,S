BTW: What i have seen in the ircomm_tty.c (2.2.18):
    647     save_flags(flags);
    648     cli();
    649 
    650     skb = self->tx_skb;
    651     self->tx_skb = NULL;
    652 
    653     restore_flags(flags);
and a lot of other places simply use "save_flags(flags); cli();
restore_flags()". Can someone enlighten me how this is supposed to work
on SMP machines ? AFAIK "cli()" only disables IRQs on the local
CPU so a different CPU could easily stumple half way as this
is definitly non atomic. Or is the tty layer protected by some
"big tty lock" ?

     Why is it called "common sense" when nobody seems to have any?
