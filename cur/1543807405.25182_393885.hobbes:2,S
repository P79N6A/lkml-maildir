These patch set introduces separate namespaces as those in filesystems.
What exactly you don't like in this approach? Can you be more specific?

What do you mean by that? That you don't care about virtualization of 
UIDs? So your migration doesn't care at all whether 2 systems have same 
uids? Do you keep /etc/passwd in sync when do migration?
Only full virtualization allows to migrate applications without bugs and 
different effects.

Just introduce config option for each virtualization functionality. 
That's it.

Ok. I will remake them either :)
