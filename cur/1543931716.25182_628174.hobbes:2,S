I'm not sure what you are doing there.
Do you have module autoloading disabled?
This all works perfectly well on all of my systems. And I never heared
such a problem before.
If you have a PCI device probing works as follows:
The PCI table is in ssb. So as soon as your kernel detects the PCI device
it will load ssb. ssb will register the PCI device. That will trigger
an udev event for the contained 802.11 core to get probed. This will load
b43.
So, I'm not sure where's the issue with my code here.

The driver is shipped by Fedora since quite some time.

You can't do
modprobe ssb b43
This will be interpreted as modprobe of "ssb" with the module
parameter "b43". At least by my modutils.
If you do
modprobe b43
it will automatically load _all_ required modules.
It works perfectly well on my systems.
Try it. Simply type "modprobe b43". It will also work for you.

All problems so far were not related to the b43 sourcecode at all.
And I think I can not be held responsible for unrelated code or bugs
in the operating system scripts.
