I already spend half the day on this (and the other half installing XP 
SP2 and fixing various issue after sucessfull installation :-))

Well, either the bk-acpi.patch for 2.6.8-rc4-mm1 is broken (I mean does 
not contain the right set of fixes) or, as you suggested (and I reached 
the same conclusion while browsing the acpi bitkeeper tree), I reverted 
all the ACPI related patches (bk + another one) to have something that 
should be _exactly_ equivalent to 2.6.8-rc3-mm1.
I've have seen someone on the ACPI mailing list complaining that its 
thermal zone disappear with 2.6.8-rc4-mm1. Maybe some ACPI related table 
get corrupted by someone else...
Last symtom I've found : I also have strange ide error message 
(something like wait for controller to be ready...),
