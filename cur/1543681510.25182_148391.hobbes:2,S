I.e. switch between those two modes according to how the laptop is
being used at the time.  When travelling I use the lid switch to
suspend (well I used to before I dropped it and broke the lid switch
:) - at home I use the button.
I'd hope that suspend-to-disk could be activated in the same way
(whatever way it is) that suspend-to-ram is now.
