It would *definitely* always be safest to emulate what Windows does.

You seem to put a lot of trust in a piece of documentation.
Do you realize how those pieces of paper are written? They are written by 
people who have absolutely *nothing* to do with the actual implementation, 
and whose job it is to write documentation. And while the people who 
actually do the programming etc are supposed to help them, the two parties 
generally detest each other.
Technical writers hate the "real engineers" for not helping them, and the 
"real engineers" tend to dislike having to be pestered to explain their 
stuff and have to read through some document that isn't meant for them, 
but that they need to sign off on.
In other words: please do *not* expect that the documentation actually 
matches reality. You seem to think that the documentation came first 
and/or is quite accurate. That's not at all likely to be true.

No, we should try to figure out what Windows does. *If* windows checks the 
version, we should do that too. But we should absolutely *not* just assume 
that the documentation is an accurate picture of reality.
Does anybody know how we could find out?
