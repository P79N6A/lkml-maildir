I have seen this message, new with 2.4.0-2mdk
(before I have 2.4.0-0.15mdk)
but only on one PC.
I have 2 PC, with same hardware, same PCMCIA config
The first have mandrake 7.2 Odissey, and the modules
floppy and floppy_cs are loaded, and /mnt/floppy is mounted
modutils-2.4.1-1mdk
The second have mandrake 7.1 Helium, and the modules
fail during init. and I have this message:
'mount: /dev/fd0 has wrong major or minor number'
modutils-2.3.21-2mdk (the last rpm-3)
I have copied the files of modutils-2.4.1-1mdk, 
and created 2 sym.links:
# ls -l /lib/modules/2.4.0-2mdk/pcmcia/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           29 jan 10 22:09 ds.o -> ../kernel/drivers/pcmcia/ds.o
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           32 jan 17 11:30 floppy.o -> ../kernel/drivers/block/floppy.o
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           35 jan 17 11:30 floppy_cs.o -> ../kernel/drivers/block/floppy_cs.o
and now, it works!
