I absolutly agree with your opinion here. But due to the fact that the 
driver sources from the manufacturer where c++, a wrapper was easier 
(and the license of the driver is... restrictive I'm afraid...). But a 
rewrite in C is only a matter of time!
anyway, I have sound again, that's enough for the next few weeks I think.
