The problem here is that I often cannot do a sane merge. 
I have no problem at all merging stuff that is a week old or so (major 
clashes happen sometimes, and I ask for help, but it's rare). However, if 
somebody really uses a major external CVS tree and does big patches, 
eventually the likelihood of a problem grows big enough that the patch 
sender might as well merge _first_ anyway, since otherwise I'll just ask 
for his help.
HOWEVER, even if I end up having to ask for help, this is probably 
preferable to the "just install my tree" approach, since at least we don't 
lose bugfixes and other updates silently.
