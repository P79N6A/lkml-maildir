With vesafb, you should be able to get any resultion you want at
60Hz. Which is okay, because you have LCD.

Okay, 
static int agp_intel_resume(struct pci_dev *pdev)
{
        struct agp_bridge_data *bridge = pci_get_drvdata(pdev);
        if (bridge->driver == &intel_generic_driver)
                intel_configure();
        else if (bridge->driver == &intel_845_driver)
                intel_845_configure();
        return 0;
}
intel_agp tries to implement resume, try to put printk("something");
mdelay(1000); in it and debug it this way.
drivers/char/drm/i830_drv driver is apparently using DMA _and_  has no
suspend/resume support. That looks dangerous to me, perhaps you'll
need to implement those, too.
