No less a distribution than, say, Debian. You just type 'emerge' rather 
than 'apt-get' and get source tarballs rather than binary packages.

Not quite; ebuilds are all on-disk. The only time you talk to a server is 
to update the on-disk ebuild tree (via rsync) or download a source 
tarball. Pretty much the same way BSD ports works. Taking apart and 
modifying the build is pretty trivial thanks to the ebuild(1) tool and the 
fact that ebuilds are in bash with Portage extensions.

Gentoo solves this problem with USE flags by providing a reasonable 
default set and letting users fine-tune the support they want prior to 
building the system.

The advantage, in my view, of compiling from source consistently is that 
you (a) eliminate any potential bugs from the build system being 
drastically different from the target system and (b) have the flexibility 
of being able to fine-tune dependencies and build time configuration. 
Where's the RPM package for Mozilla with encryption, without debugging, 
with gtk2, with ipv6, without ldap, without the calendar, with mail, 
without IRC, and without XFT? How about GCC with gcj, without f77, without 
nls, with objc?
It's certainly not for everybody, but to me that's the most important 
aspect of always compiling from source.
