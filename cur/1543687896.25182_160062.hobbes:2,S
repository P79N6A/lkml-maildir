Ok so it isn't a BUG().  The next thing I'd consider is whether it was
a corrupted pci driver list, but it doesn't look like it.
Ok, lets try to get some extra info from your kernel - please apply
the patch below.  This is likely to produce a fair amount of extra
messages at boot.  It should also produce another raft of messages
when you insert the cardbus card but before the module, and another
raft afterwards.
I'm only interested in the ones around the time when you insert the
cardbus card and the module.
