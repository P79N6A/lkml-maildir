In that post I was really asking the following questions:
* how often does smp_send_reschedule get called?
* how often does smp_migrate_task get called?
* if smp_send_reschedule and smp_migrate_task were mutually exclusive,
  i.e. both used the same spinlock, could that lead to deadlock?
James Bottomley answered the first two for me but not the third.
Paul.
