Yes, sure. As I said, I've already written something.
http://www.saout.de/misc/dm-convert-0.1.tar.bz2
I fixed it up so that it actually somehow. If it fails it leaves some
devices around that you'll have to remove by hand. It has support for
being interrupted and resumed later but I currently don't catch the
signal to put it into a reasonable state so don't interrupt it.
Syntax: dmconvert <source> <dest>
Where <source> and <dest> are the dm device names. <source> and <dest>
should be the same size and be backed by the same device (but can be
differently encrypted). <source> can be mounted and if dmconvert
finishes will use the mapping <dest> used, <dest> will be removed.

Yes. The block that is currently being converted is mapped to a third
temporary target that is suspended by dm so no I/O gets dispatched
there. Then the other two temporary targets are used to actually copy
that data (they contain the mappings of the original <source> and
<dest>). The <source> target (where the fs can be mounted on) maps to
all three temporary targets. After conversion of a block is finished,
the suspended target is resumed, the mappings updated and the next block
started.
If the machine crashes, well... good luck. :)
