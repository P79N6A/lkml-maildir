This patch can't be right.  Not the way proc_clear_tty is called
once for each process in the session, plus we aren't clearing
tty->session and tty->pgrp here. 
If the above patch works it's a fluke.
Still it is the right general area of the code.  I've just started
looking at this it is going to take me a bit to come up to speed on
this code again and see what silly thing is missing.
