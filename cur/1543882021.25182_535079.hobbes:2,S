Yeah, the original script tried to do things like spinlock balancing checks,
(badly). This was long before had sparse, and it was partly a "lets learn some perl"
experience for myself. I'll toss that idea out now that we have better tools
for that, and keep it to simple checks.

Ok, I've got a few different flavours of that script. I'll roll them
all into one tomorrow and throw out some of the noisy silly ones
(I don't think warning about strcpy->strncpy is really worthwhile for eg).
Additional regexps gratefully recieved.
