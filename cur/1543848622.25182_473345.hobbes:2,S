Subject: MMC: When rescanning cards check existing cards after mmc_setup()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Some broken cards seem to process CMD1 even in stand-by state. The result is
that the card replies with ILLEGAL_COMMAND error for the next command sent
after rescanning. Currently the next command is select card, which would
return the error. But the CMD7 does actually succeed and retries of the
command will timeout. The solution is to poll card status after the CMD1
which clears the cached error.
