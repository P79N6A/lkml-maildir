Hi everybody,
I am a newbie to Linux. I have a problem. I had Win 2K Pro installed on my
PC. When I got Red Hat Linux 8.0 installed on it, the it showed "Unsupported
VGA card", but the rest of the installation went fine. Now, I can log in to
Linux, and only the command line is seen. When I enter the "startx" command,
it gives some big error.
I have an ASUS P4SDR-VM motherboard with onboard VGA. Probably it is not
supported by Red Hat. What do I do to get KDE/GNOME desktops working ? What
exactly should I look for - is it the display drivers or RPMs ? Can I get
anything from www.kernel.org ? Somebody told me that nVidia's nForce or
gForce drivers should work for ASUS motherboard. Is that true ? In ASUS's
website, I can see display drivers for download, for Red Hat Linux 7.3. Will
those also work for 8.0 ? Are the display drivers specific to the
motherboard make, or the Linux distro and version ?
I am quite confused and would really appreciate a detailed reply.
Thanking you all in anticipation.
With kind regards,
Pratyush Joshi
