Latest kernel from git (2.6.14-rc2-g87e807b6) still causes the problem
for me.  Reversing cset 10f47e6a1b8b276323b652053945c87a63a5812d fixes
it for me.
I'll build a kernel with CONFIG_EXT2_FS_XATTR disabled and see if that
also makes the issue go away.
I have a question though.  When looking at the code in
fs/ext2/ialloc.c for ext2_new_inode().  The failure path for
ext2_init_acl() includes a DQUOT_DROP(), but the failure path for
ext2_init_security() does not. e.g.:
        err = ext2_init_acl(inode, dir);
        if (err) { 
                DQUOT_FREE_INODE(inode);
                DQUOT_DROP(inode);
                goto fail2;
        }
        err = ext2_init_security(inode,dir);
        if (err) { 
                DQUOT_FREE_INODE(inode);
                goto fail2;
        }
Is this right?  Or should we really have the following:
