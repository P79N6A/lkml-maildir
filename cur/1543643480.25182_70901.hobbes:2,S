I run into problems fairly often that I can't reproduce in UML - timing
sensitive, hardware sensitive, etc.  Some of them KGDB perturbs too
much to be useful, but most of the time I can get it to work.  UML also
doesn't use a lot of the code under arch/i386/ (or didn't at least)
which makes debugging that code under UML a bit futile.

Well, yeah.  It's getting a little bit better - a lot better for some
cases - but no one's really sure where it needs to go to keep
improving.  I'm making a little progress.
