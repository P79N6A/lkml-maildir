Hi,
 I have the following questions. Please help me.
 Software Environment:
    1. kernel - linux-2.4.19 + intel_bsp patched.
    2. DiskOnChip -- 64Mbytes.
 We have made the DiskOnChip as a u-disk.
 Q1.
    When I use "mkdosfs /dev/tffsa1", WIN2000 And WINXP can
    read/write the /dev/tffsa1. 
    When I use "mkdosfs -S 4096 /dev/tffsa1", WIN2000
    can read/write the /dev/tffsa1, But Winxp can't.
    Why? W can I make the winxp can read/write the /dev/sda1.
 Q2. 
    When using "mkdosfs /dev/tffsa1", Our VideoRecord isn't fluent. 
    When using "mkdosfs -S 4096 /dev/tffsa1", Our VideoRecord is fluent.
    I wonder how the sector size affect the Video Record.
 Our ultimate goal is 'Video Record is fluent and Win2000/Winxp can 
 read/write the /dev/tffsa1 as a u-disk.
 Could you anyone give me some good advice? 
 Thanks in advance!
