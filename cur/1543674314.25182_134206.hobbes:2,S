I don't even think we can do that.  That code was being integrated
around the same time that our Specweb setup decided to go south on us
and start physically frying itself.  We never got a chance to run it. 
BTW, I don't think there are any other kernel developers running Specweb
on 2.5 kernels.  If there are, please speak up!
Andrew Theurer posted some positive results here, which were quite
marginal in the case with 1 nic.  4.7% with two.
