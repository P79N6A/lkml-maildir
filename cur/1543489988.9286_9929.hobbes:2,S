This was me. More precisely, the stack usually grows towards heap+code.
Code likes to grow up, stack likes to have a known endpoint in memory..
This puts code at the bottom, stack at the top, and the heap at the top of
the code.
And I'll now amend that to say that it just doesn't matter on a 64 bit
system. Current 64-bit systems only have 40-some bits of real address
space. There is zero danger of running out of virtual address space. By
the time we're in danger of exhausting 64 bits of physical memory we will
have all long since moved to 128 bit systems. Put everything wherever you
want. Force all code addresses to have zero bytes to discourage stack
exploits. Have the stack grow up and give it a nice address prefix so it's
easy to read. Use one stack for addresses, another for variables. Give the
heap its own address prefix too. Whatever's easiest to read.
