Hmm...
I tried to run SetiAtHome at IDLEPRIO, but it competes equally with a
while(1); loop run at nice 19. I'm starting to wonder if there isn't
some kind of bug in the kernel which results in a program returning from
a system call with an in-kernel semaphore held. After all, according to
top, SetiAtHome consumes over 90% CPU, and the system consumes only
about 1%, so it can't be making system calls all the time either. Or
maybe there's some case where the calculations can become confused and
think that a semaphore is still being held when it's not.
Is there any way to test this ?
Anyway, I ran strace on FahCore (a program, launched by SetiAtHome main
program, that actually consumes the CPU), and got this:
rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, [CHLD], [RTMIN], 8) = 0
rt_sigaction(SIGCHLD, NULL, {SIG_DFL}, 8) = 0
rt_sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, [RTMIN], NULL, 8) = 0
nanosleep({5, 0}, {5, 0})               = 0
nanosleep({0, 0}, NULL)                 = 0
This pattern just keeps on repeating, endlessly. Occasionally it also
has
kill(5432, SIG_0)                       = 0
attached to it. 5432 is the parent process, the FAH502-Linux.exe.
There is something very strange going on here...
