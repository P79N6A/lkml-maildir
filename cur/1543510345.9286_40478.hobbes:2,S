And if you are going to use the IKD patch make sure to NOT enable the
CONFIG_DEBUG_SOFTLOCKUP kernel option or you'll get a crash for sure into
some time. That's not a bug, it's a feature.
Actually I released a new 2.2.12-ikd5 patch with kdb merged into it
(xkdebug removed).
And thanks to "Michael L. Galbraith" <mikeg@weiden.de> that is working
actively with me on the IKD patch.
