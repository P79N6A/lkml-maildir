Hmm so how about extending oprofile to always log the syscall number
in the event logs (can be gotten from top of stack). I think given
that you could reconstruct that data in the userland at least
for single threads (not for work done on behalf of them in other
threads; but I'm not sure you tried to solve that problem at all)
The advantage is that it would be an generic mechanism that would work
for all types of profiling.
