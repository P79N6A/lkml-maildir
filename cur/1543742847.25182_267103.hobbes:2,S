I solved it for RADEON, MGA and R128.
It would be interesting to solve this for the i915 driver, too,
and possibly some others.
That it hasn't been merged into DRI yet is a shame. Appearantly 
nobody has ever realized why this stuff is useful. Unfortunately
I don't have the time for lobbying it.
It's a very boring undertaking to have to port this from one DRI 
version to the next. 
Egbert.
