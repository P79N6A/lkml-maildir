allocate_compression_buffers() currently allocates all buffers up
smp_num_cpus which is fine without hotswap cpus. Once hotswap cpus path
goes in, then the allocation will be (pseudo code):
	for (i = 0; i < NR_CPUS; i++) {
		if (cpu_possible(i)) {
			ntfs_compression_buffer[i] = vmalloc();
			// TODO handle errors
		}
	}
That means in words that we allocate buffers only once and for all
existing cpu SOCKETS, i.e. including all potentially hotpluggable cpus
which are currently offline. - If someone invents hotpluggable cpu sockets
at some point then they should be burnt at the stake! (-;
