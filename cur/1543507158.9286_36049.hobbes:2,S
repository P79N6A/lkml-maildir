I missed the schedule() in ret_from_syscall because I didn't realize that 
kernel_thread (in arch/i386) actually does a system call.  kernel_thread (in 
arch/um) just makes a procedure call, and there's no possibility I can see for 
the child running first.
The stuff below is right, but you missed the real problem.

To reiterate, the scenario is
	parent calls kernel_thread(child)
	child is created, but doesn't get to run
	something else calls wake_up(child_tsk), but child_tsk is NULL
BTW, this isn't a theoretical thing I noticed by staring at the code.  I ran 
into this reliably with the user-mode kernel.  fsck hit it by running memory 
down while reading the filesystem.  I believe that the problem was triggered 
by my disk driver not sleeping at all.  It just does file reads and writes 
into the hosting filesystem and returns instantaneously as far as the kernel 
was concerned.  So there was no down time in which kswapd could get to run and 
initialize kswapd_process.  So, try_to_free_pages came along and woke up 
kswapd_process, which was NULL.
So, if both parent and child can sleep before the kernel_thread returns, while 
something else runs and tries to wake up the child, I don't see a solution, 
short of having the something else sleep for a bit and hope that the child 
wakes up enough to set child_tsk.
Anybody have any better ideas?
