Dynamic content is no problem. FreeBSD uses sysctl
to implement their "ps" program. The process info comes
out of sysctl now. The sysctl man page has an example.
Non-numeric data is more troublesome. FreeBSD has
a syscall that will take text (still faster than /proc/sys),
and another that will convert the text representation
into numeric form for later high-performance use.
Look up all 3 calls here, in section 2:
