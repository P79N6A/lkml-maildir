Works here with router and host running 2.2.1
Doesn't work with host running 2.1.132 and a commercial firewall.
Also, it seems that I cannot connect to the following sites:
www.fore.com
www.extremenetworks.com
I tried 2.2.[0|1] and 2.1.132. 
I'll try to come up with some tcpdump outputs tomorrow.

Some weird  messages I  saw in my  syslog on the  router while  it was
still running 2.1.132:
Jan 28 17:47:38 r2d2 kernel: IP_MASQ:forward ICMP: failed checksum from
     207.94.36.10!
Jan 28 17:48:13 r2d2 last message repeated 7 times
Jan 28 17:49:18 r2d2 last message repeated 13 times
Jan 28 17:49:23 r2d2 kernel: IP_MASQ:forward ICMP: failed checksum from
     207.94.36.10!
This is really bad because I had no masquerading rules on this machine
(even though  ip_masq is built into  the kernel). So this  part of the
code shouldn't be triggered.
And the problem occurs with or without firewalling rules.
