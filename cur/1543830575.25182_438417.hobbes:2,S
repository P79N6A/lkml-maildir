It's because it's all so interconnected. Adding the modular infrastructure is 
useless without something to use the modules. Changing to use the pageflags 
functionality requires modifications in both the preparation of the image and 
in the I/O. There are bits that could be done incrementally, but they're 
minor. I did start with the same codebase that Pavel forked, but then did 
substantial rewrites in going from the betas to 1.0 and to 2.0.
Thanks for the email.
