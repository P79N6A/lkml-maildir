    Given that it happens too with "ldd", it really *is* that hard. I
don't know why still people think that /bin/sh is always /bin/bash. If
they want/need bash, that's ok to me, I will have it installed for such
tasks, but they should call it "#!/bin/bash".
    It seems easier to say "get a real shell" (as if Bash was the only
real shell) than fixing that bug...
