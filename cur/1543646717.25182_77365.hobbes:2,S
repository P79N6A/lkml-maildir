It's a very confusing table, but more importantly it seems to imply that 
/dev/hda{5,6,7,8} all start at cylinder 63, and end in a variety of places.
If this is an accurate representation of the partition table on this disk, I 
would suggest you recover what you can from it, and start over.
Better would be to have a look at the partition table with something that can 
fix it, like fdisk, sfdisk or parted. Example:
sfdisk -l /dev/hda
