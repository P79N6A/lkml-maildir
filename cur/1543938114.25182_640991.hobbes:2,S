Hello Arjan,
a few comments on the current locking scheme.
There is a single global lock and the locked section in
account_scheduler_latency() seems to be quite long:
(at worst case)
- get_wchan() ;
- account_global_scheduler_latency() which does up to MAXLR (128)
loops x2 strcmp() operations;
- up to LT_SAVECOUNT (32) x2 strcmp() operations by
account_scheduler_latency() itself.
That may induce a high latency for paths which call set_latency_reason_*().
Looking at the code, it looks like what really needs to be protected
is 'task->latency_reason'.
task->latency_record[] and a global latency_record[] are printed out
without any synchronization with account_scheduler_latency(). Is it
your intention?
That can be ok if we want to trade some preciseness for lower lock-contention.
If so,
- account_scheduler_latency() might take a snapshot of
'tsk->latency_reason' with the 'latency_lock' being held and do the
rest in a lock-less way.
Note, we have only a single writer to 'tsk->latency_record[]' at any
time due to the rq->lock to which 'tsk' belongs to being held ;
- yeah, this way the global 'latency_record[]' needs some sort of
protection as we may have concurrent writers here.
what do you think?
and a few minor comments below:

provided we hit a number of consequent "latencies" with explicitly
unspecified 'tsk->latency_reason', they all end up recorded in a
single 'tsk->latency_record' with "Unknown reason" and the _same_
'argument' which is the result of get_wchan() for the very _first_
"latency" in a row.
I think, it would make sense to record them separately with their
respective get_wchan() (so that they still could be identified).
