LVM. Systems like LVM already provide a logical->physical block
mapping on disk, so they might as well provide multiple mappings.
If the live filesystem writes to a particular disk block, the
snapshot will keep referencing the old blocks while the filesystem
gets to work on its own data. Copy on Write snapshots for block
devices...
