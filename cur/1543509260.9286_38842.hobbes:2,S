I dont think there is any use in different parameters for module/in kernel
use. I basically think one should enforce a new policy with
 -  just renaming MODULE_PARAM to SETUP_PARAM (this would of course
    confuse people using the other MODULE_ macros...)
 -  force anyone to use a suitable prefix for the parameters
    rather than inventing a new "prefix macro"
The patch was actually done to _not_ require any driver change (of course
I missed the #ifdef'ed out MODULE_PARAM's in most drivers...).
If we want to design a new and improved parameter passing interface
it sould be generic, though this is surely too late for 2.4 as it
would require changes to existing drivers (it really should to be
a good design).
Richard.
