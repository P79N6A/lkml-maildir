Hi,
I just hear that Swap is not handled identically in Rik VM/AA VM/2.2 VM.
I use -ac kernels (with Rik's VM). Could someone precise what exactly
happens when I have:
- 256Mb RAM + 512Mb Swap
- 512Mb RAM + 512Mb Swap
- 1Gb RAM + 512Mb Swap
- 1Gb RAM + 1.2Gb Swap
How many swap is available to applications in each case?
Thanks a lot
-jec
PS: Could you please send me directly the answer, I'm not in the list.
