That's another problem... what is a driver that creates 15 files
supposed to do ? Have 15 booleans to remember which files where
successfully created and then test all of them on cleanup ? That sounds
like even more bloat to me...
What about making sysfs_remove_bin_file() not complain ? It's common
practice to have disposal things not complain ... like kfree(NULL), or
the changes done recently so that misc_deregister() can be called even
if misc_register() failed etc...
