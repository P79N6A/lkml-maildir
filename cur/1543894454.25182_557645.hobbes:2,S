OK. Let's take this to the simple and logical conclusion. A signed
filesystem image containing both GPL and non-GPL code. From your
point A, this is a derived work. 
Let's read the license...
2. b) You must cause any work that ... is derived from the Program or any
   part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
   parties under the terms of this License.
...
 But when you
 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
 on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
and yet later:
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
Pick one. They can't both be valid.
Moreover, this interpretation means that Red Hat (and pretty much
any other Linux distributor) should close up shop, as that's what
we've been doing for years.
