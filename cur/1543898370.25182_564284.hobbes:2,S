  ah, that wasn't obvious from the text.  in any event, there's still
some cosmetic cleanup that can be done if that driver's going to stick
around.
  first, from Documentation/ioctl-number.txt:
...
Documentation/ioctl-number.txt:'d'      F0-FF   linux/digi1.h
Documentation/ioctl-number.txt:'e'      all     linux/digi1.h           conflict!
...
there *is* no header file linux/digi1.h -- there is, however, a
drivers/char/digi1.h.
  also, there are references to a README.epca file in various places:
Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt:                    See drivers/char/README.epca and
Documentation/digiepca.txt:drivers/char/README.epca for more details.  Note,
drivers/char/epca.c:/* See README.epca for change history --DAT*/
but there is no README.epca file.  just a couple observations.
