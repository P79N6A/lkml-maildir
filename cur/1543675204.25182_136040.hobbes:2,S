Subject: [RFC] Two patches - ptrace single stepping + modpost.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Ok, here's two patches I'd like to get sorted out and merged into
2.5 or whatever.
The first: add a flag to tsk->ptrace to indicate whether we're
single stepping or not.  This is used by the ARM ptrace code in
arch/arm/kernel/signal.c to decide whether we need to halt the
process for the debugger during signal processing, or remove
and set single stepping breakpoints.
Other architectures which use similar schemes (eg, alpha) might also
like this; it looks like Alpha may be a little buggy; it appears
to carry the single stepping status across signal handling.  What
happens if the debugger decides to disable single stepping when
the debugged process receives a signal?

The second: this allows modpost.c to build on ARM.  For some unknown
reason, EM_SPARC* are not present in my system headers.  This isn't
the right solution since it would interfere with cross-building SPARC.
Are EM_SPARC* normally defined as preprocessor macros or enums?
