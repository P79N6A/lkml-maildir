Kernel is having trouble with hdb (which seems to be your DVD drive.) After 
running into problems the kernel has disabled DMA on the drive and when it 
does that there is bound to be some problems with watching DVDs because the 
CPU is used for memory transfers as well as for watching the DVD (can't do 
both at a time without running into problems).

Lost ticks look like they are direct result of the problems with your DVD 
drive. 
If you post your kernel version, .config and hardware information (Which IDE 
controller specifically) some one will be able to look into the problem.
