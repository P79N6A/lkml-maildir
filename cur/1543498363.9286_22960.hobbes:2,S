    Cute. All, right, if you want to define kdev_t that way, go ahead. It
    now has no relation to i_rdev. So once again we go through a lookup.
I am not sure what you mean by `no relation to i_rdev'.
Indeed, i_rdev is of type kdev_t.
Of course there is a lookup somewhere, namely at the moment
the device node is opened.
