I'm not interested in made-up benchmarks that cannot be reproduced under
real load.
Can you make it show up on a real filesystem even with a contrieved
user-mode benchmark?
(Btw, even if you do convince me, please don't use a name like "hlist".
"hlist WHAT?" What's the "h" for? "hash"? Why? Basically, it sounds
nonsensical).
Btw, from past exprience I've found that it can be a lot more advantageous
to just dynamically move the hash entries to the front of the list when
accessed, rather than worry about how the list is set up. Hashes are bad
on the caches by design, and whether the hash table takes up x or 2x of
memory is pretty  much immaterial for performance. But whether you find
the entry on the first or the fifth try is noticeable.
I suspect you'd find more of a performance advantage from trying something
like that instead..
