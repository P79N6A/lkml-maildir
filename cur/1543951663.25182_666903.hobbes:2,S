> A couple of small comments about how CLD_CONTINUED notification works.
A worthy addition.  I would make the get_signal_to_deliver comment say a
little more.  In particular, it's kind of nonobvious that though this
happens at the beginning of the function, the importance of its placement
is really that it will always be run (via the relock: loop) just after any
wake-up from having been in TASK_STOPPED.
Thanks,
Roland
