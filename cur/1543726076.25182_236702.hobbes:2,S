Sony has used LTT in the past, and we plan to use it for a few more
development projects underway currently.  It would be nice if we
didn't have to wait for all the pieces to fall together for each
new kernel release (arch support, trace point patches, desired
sub-system stability).  Having seen LTT used for a number of years,
I'd have to agree with Karim's assessment that it would probably
be "neater" today if so much time hadn't been spent over the
years wrangling it into the kernel.
