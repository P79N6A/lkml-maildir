Nothing, except that it only provides logical information.  In a large
system, it's really useful to be able to physically locate a component
somehow.  That was the idea behind adding 'physid'.  For example:
[jbarnes@spamtin pci0000:02]$ pwd
/sys/devices/pci0000:02
[jbarnes@spamtin pci0000:02]$ cat physid
rack: 5
module: 12
slot: 3
or for nodes:
[jbarnes@spamtin node2]$ cat physid
rack: 1
module: 3
slot: 1
Then you could walk into the lab and know exactly which device to
kick.  Obviously, these values would be platform specific, though on
ia64 and some x86 platforms, we could probably use the ACPI namespace
to access some of the info, and on ppc the OF namespace might have it.
Thanks,
Jesse
