The drive (IDE model, SCSI can have larger sector size) will do 
read-modify-write for smaller writes. So there should be no compatibility 
issues. (this possibility is in new ATA standard and there is a way how to 
detect physical sector size)
But how will fdisk deal with it? Fdisk by default aligns partitions on 
63-sector boundary, so it will make all sectors misaligned and seriously 
kill performance even if filesystem uses proper 8-sector aligned accesses.
