I didn't expect it to work, just heading for the easy to hit difference first.

                             ^--- INTX disable bit
	Vista isn't enabling MSI, Linux is.
	Try "nomsi"?

 	     48: PCI Express device control
	            Vista: 0000
                    Linux: 000f = advanced error reports enabled
	     4c: PCI Express device status
	            Vista: 0010
		    Linux: 0011 = correctable error detected
  Driver doesn't clear error during boot, you can do it with
  setpci but it doesn't fix problem. (I do have fix bug it is
  not important for this discussion).

   These are the MSI setup registers which Vista isn't using.

So only difference I see is MSI, and advanced error reporting
bits.
