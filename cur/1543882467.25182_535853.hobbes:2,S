Sorry Pekka, but that's just broken.
It implies firstly that we tell all userspace programs "I'm sorry, but
I'm suspending at the moment. Can you tip toe quietly around while I do
it?" You can't seriously expect every userspace program to be modified
to adjust it's behaviour according to whether we're writing a snapshot
to disk at the moment or not.
It also implies that we can prepare a snapshot and then happily have the
contents of the disk change so that they don't match the superblock and
other filesystem details we just saved in the snapshot. We can't. At
least not without modifying all the filesystems so that (at a minimum)
they know how to throw away all the metadata they have at resume time
and reread it from disk.

This sounds feasible, but it's only really acceptable if your willing to
have hibernation fail or restart multiple times. If your battery is
running out or you need to rush to put a lappy in your bag because they
train just came early, that's not an option. It's for that very reason
that I've put a lot of effort into trying to make it work first time,
every time. Not there yet, but it's a priority.
By the way, sorry. This email feels like it is pouring a lot of cold
water on your ideas. I don't want to be negative!

Nigel
