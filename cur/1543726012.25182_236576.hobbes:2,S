I have been using ipods with linux for about 3 years.
And I see that it says "do not disconnect" even after I have unmounted
the file system.  I just disconnect it at this point and have not
had any problems.

This has been discussed in length on lkml many times during the
writing of udev.  IIRC the argument was something like:
 "we shouldn't be unloading modules because the memory taken up by a
 module in memory(a few k) isn't worth writing the code to save"
I also recall there was something about end user behavior, but I don't
remember the details.  Read the archives.
