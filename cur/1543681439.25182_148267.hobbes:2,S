I have a small problem with radeonfb in 2.4.22-pre5 (+manually created
radeonfb.h file). During boot, when the console is switched over to
the frame buffer device, the screen becomes corrupted. Mostly by white
squares in a grid pattern and some squares with other colors. Between
the squares, normal characters can be seen, but each character is
duplicated. Here is a picture: (not very sharp unfortunately)

Text added after the switch is not corrupted, so eventually the
corruption is scrolled off the screen and after that the framebuffer
appears to be working correctly.
2.4.22-pre3 does not have this problem. I haven't found a patch for
the vanilla 0.1.8 version, so I don't know if that version also has
this problem. I think someone has reported a similar problem in 2.5.x,
but I don't remember the details.
Here are some messages from the kernel log:
