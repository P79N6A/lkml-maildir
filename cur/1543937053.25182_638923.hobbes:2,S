This was also covered in the checkpatch output that you conveniently
trimmed in your reply. If you can't see the problem, either your version
of checkpatch or your editor are broken. Huge amounts of your patch
continue to be whitespace damaged, and while you claim to have fixed
that, checkpatch continually whines about the same thing in each
iteration of your patch. Please just fix it up instead of arguing about
it, thanks.
