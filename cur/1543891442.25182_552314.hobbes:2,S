    The switch to utf-8 is possible, I know, but I wasn't so sure about
the switch to utf-8 *in the console only*.

    I was going to take a look at Linux From Scratch (and BLFS, too) for
help, but before trying anything there I wanted to be sure that the
kernel will work. Otherwise I will put my effort in building a minimal X
setup with a suitable terminal emulator.
    Anyway, if everything works in the console in the LFS LiveCD, I will
be sure that I can make the change and then I'll look directly in the
LFS book for further instructions.
    Thanks a lot! :)

    There are more terminal emulators for console than I supposed.

    Well, I'll deal with that issue if I like them more than screen or
plain console.
    Thanks again :)
