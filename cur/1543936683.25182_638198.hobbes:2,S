There have been quite a few changes in lblnet-2.6_testing since 2.6.24-rc6-mm1 
so I would recommend taking the whole tree.  I'm also not quite sure if 
simply reverting the "Convert the netif code to use ifindex values" patch 
would solve the problem as there are other patches in the rc6-mm1 tree that 
rely on skb->iif being valid (new code, not converted code).  If you want to 
stick with a _relatively_ vanilla rc6-mm1 tree I would leave everything in 
and simply apply the following patch which solved the skb_clone()/iif 
problem:
