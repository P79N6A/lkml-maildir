Yeah, I missed that.  And my spot checking didn't catch anything IA64
related.  Was there anything else on IA64 that competed with the current
rack of 8-way IA32 boxen, or the upcoming 16-way stuff rolling out
this year?  Seems like the larger phys memory support should help on
several of those benchmarks...
The thin number of IA64 results indicates the difference in marketing/sales,
although better price/performance should be able to change that... ;)
Odd that MS is still outdoing Linux (or SQL is outdoing Oracle on Linux).
Will be nice when that changes...
