I get this when trying to build 2.6.12-rc2-mm1 : 
  CC      arch/i386/kernel/setup.o
arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:96: error: parse error before "acpi_sci_flags"

If I enable CONFIG_ACPI all is well - it seems some things get enabled by 
CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT regardless of CONFIG_ACPI being defined, this causes 
things to break since some of the stuff CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT enables depends 
on things only enabled in include/linux/acpi.h when CONFIG_ACPI is set...
