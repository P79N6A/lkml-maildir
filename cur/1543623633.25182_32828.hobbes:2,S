Your analysis of the problem is entierly right, since the current
kernel behaviour for removable media is supposed to work for
floppies (never get this thing out of your computer
as long as long the diode blinks) or read only media where it doesn't
really matter. However I still don't see a good way to
resolve this issue. (Maybe just adding buffer cache flush before
going into the check_media_change business of "grocking" partitions
would be sufficient...
