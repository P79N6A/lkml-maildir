That doesn't really help in my opinion.  We need the comfort of knowing
that if we do find a bug, then soon we will have a release that will fix
this bug, with a *very* high probability of not changing anything else
significantly, or adding new regressions.  The current wait between
the official releases is too long to wait for a bug fix, but it is also likely
that other regressions have slipped in due to the large churn in the code.
If you simply release faster, without doing bug-fix only releases, then
I think we'll continue to see regressions.
I think the 2.6.X.y release scheme could work, as others have mentioned.
