Users cannot use gcc 2.96 as shipped in RedHat 7.0 if they want to use
reiserfs.  It is that simple.  How can you even consider defending allowing the
use of it without requiring a positive affirmation by the user that they don't
know what they are doing and want to do it anyway?:-)  I could understand
arguing that you don't want to be bothered with protecting the users because you
don't have the time, but if somebody else finds the time to write the patch....
I would indeed encourage Linus to accept patches to test for known bad compilers
at make time.  It is less work for us all to prevent users from having bugs than
to respond to their having them.  I look forward to gcc 3.00, and I encourage
the compiler guys to get over being (understandably) irked that somebody else
released their code prematurely, and to increment the version number to 2.97 so
that users can more easily avoid the baddie.
