Excellent! I can always use more of these to test.
It seems odd that they don't like Fibonacci hashing, it appears to pass
various chi^2 tests on bucket distribution. And operator-sparse Fibonacci
hashing primes appear to pass it as well, at least once 10 terms of the
continued fraction match (operator-sparse Fibonacci hashing primes means
that the multiplication can be done with shifts and adds or subtracts).
Regardless, various arches want non-multiplicative hash functions and
they'll be getting them. These hash functions will certainly prove
useful in getting a broader base to test against. I don't care to have
a "pet" hash function, only one that is good as possible.
Thanks,
Bill
