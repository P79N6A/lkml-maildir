I was one keystroke away from removing you from all of the
vger.kernel.org lists because I was getting "5 day timeout"
bounces which usually means I'll be getting 5 more days of
bounces if I delete the subscription right now. :)
If you are going away for a vaction, have appropriate backup MX
records in place to queue your mail if your primary mail server goes
down.  I've crashed my primary mail server remotely to test new
kernels on several occaisions while I was on the other side of the
planet, and my backup MX made that a non-issue.
Take care.
