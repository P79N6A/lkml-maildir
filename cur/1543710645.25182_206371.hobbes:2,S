I reproduced on 2.6.4-mm1 + backing dev, but 2.6.4-mm1 alone ran fine. 
To make a long story short, the swap address space and backing dev don't
define an unplug_io_fn.  I was able to reproduce quickly with a swap
heavy workload.  The patch below should fix the oops, but probably isn't
correct solution since no queues will get unplugged while waiting on
swap pages.
It keeps the barriers for reading page->mapping, I still think we need
something there, maybe someone can suggest something better.
