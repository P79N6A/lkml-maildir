I bet you have CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG enabled. Disable it or try to put
#define ACPI_ENABLE_OBJECT_CACHE 1
at the end of include/acpi/acpi.h (before the last #endif)
This fixed it for me (and some others).
There is also a patch for a "CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG_LITE" from Thomas
Renninger on the acpi-devel list, which leaves some of the debugging in,
but disables the worst offenders IIUC.
Hope that helps,
