Done.

Right, it should return -ENOENT instead in that case. Fixed as well.

The much cleaner interface is to check if the path returned starts with a 
slash. If it doesn't, we know the path is bad as far as sys_getcwd() is 
concerned. We will construct the partial path in __d_path before figuring out 
that the path is disconnected, so no performance penalty, either.

I'm fine either way.

That's better, yes.
Thanks,
