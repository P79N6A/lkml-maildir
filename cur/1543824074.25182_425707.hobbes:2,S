Andrew, could you try the patch below, does your FC1 box work with it 
applied and CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO enabled? (no need to pass any boot 
options)
The config option reinstates the high mapping, so that old glibc can 
reference it as data (that is i think what happened in the original FC1 
glibc). Newer distributions can (and will) turn this off. The option 
defaults to y, so that we are compatible by default.
( Small additional detail: to further limit the security impact of the
  workaround, the page is nonexec, so on the unlikely chance of someone
  running a FC1 glibc with a new kernel on new, NX-capable hardware
  using the PAE i386 kernel, execution is denied on that page. [i have
  tested this kernel combination and execution is indeed denied in that
  case.] )

Subject: vDSO: provide workaround for older glibcs
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
this patch adds CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO (default=y), which provides support
for older glibcs to reference the high-mapped VDSO. Newer distributions
(anything newer than say 2 years) can turn this off.
NOTE: the exec bit is turned off for the vDSO, because glibc only
reference the vDSO, but dont try to execute it.
