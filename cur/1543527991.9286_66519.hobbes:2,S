Not thousands - there are only so many bits available. The limit is determined
by implementation. 32, 64, 128?. I find using capabilities much simpler than
having 10's-100's of programs that are setuid to root, and then attempt
drop some privilege. THAT is unmanageable.
Using multiple passwords is the same problem - how many passwords do you have
to know to implement a security administrator - one, five, 10... Now you also
have the problem of keeping track of the passwords - another unmanageable
task. My site has over 50 passwords that are necessary to implement system
management. Do you really think anywone can keep track of these in memory?
Much less - who has copies of them. It would be much simpler to eliminate the
passwords, and use some form of capability list to assign roles to the
administrators and operators.
