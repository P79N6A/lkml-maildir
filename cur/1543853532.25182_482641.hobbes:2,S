No! The success or failure of the NFS operation does _not_ depend on
CacheFiles success or failure. As far as I'm concerned, the mkdirs etc
actually _want_ to be farmed out to some background daemon so that they
have no effect on NFS performance. See below.

In the event of a mkdir() or create(), asynchronicity _does_ make a
difference, because there is no cached file to read.

See below.

No. It has whole a bunch of restrictions that normal process contexts do
not.

All that you want to _try_ to ensure is that the page gets written out
before the memory shrinker kicks it out of the page cache. There is
absolutely no need to do this synchronously. There is not even a need to
guarantee that all read pages will hit fscache.
Again, this is something that a background daemon could happily do for
you.

It doesn't, and that is my point. If the fscache backing store doesn't
have the file, then the user process wants to talk to the remote server
ASAP. It doesn't want to waste its time creating CacheFiles.

'or it has created one' is a completely artificial bottleneck that _you_

No. Why the hell should read() have to wait on what it knows to be an
empty file? As soon as that lookup() is done you can figure out that the
data is not cached, and that the read() needs to go talk to the NFS
server.
There is no reason whatsoever to wait for 50 synchronous mkdir()s and
setxattr()s to complete. Those operations can and should be farmed out
to a background process to take care of.
The ideal model looks like
        PROC A          PROC B          PROC C          PROC D
        =============== =============== =============== =============== 
        open()          open()          open()          open()
        A:lookup()      B:lookup()      C:lookup()      D:lookup()
        read()          read()          read()          read()
irrespective of whether or not fscache has a stored file.
