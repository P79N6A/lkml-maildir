As Andrew correctly pointed out, this bit error is not a RAM problem.
It is actually the low bit of a counter a spinlock that was
decremented just before the WARN_ON.  So it simply indicates that the
inode had already been freed, which I think we knew already.
Unfortunately I still have no idea why that inode had been
freed but was still referenced by a dentry....
How repeatable as this bug?  How did you narrow it down to that patch?
Did you use git-bisect or something else?
Thanks,
