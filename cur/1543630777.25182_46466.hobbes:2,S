Exactly. And this function will look like this
	if (domain(bttv_pdev) == domain(fb_pdev))
		return arch_res_to_bus(res->start) + res_off;
	else if (!interdomain_dma_supported)
		return 0;
	else
		return some_iommu_magic(...);
BTW, I don't see anymore why pci domain info should be exposed to
users at all. :-)
