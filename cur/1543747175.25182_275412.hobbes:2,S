Because /dev/urandom is the right thing to use, and /dev/random is not.

That's not accurate.  Once it has been properly seeded, /dev/urandom
should be fine for this purpose (assuming no root compromise).  Because
/dev/urandom uses a cryptographically secure PRNG, once it has been securely
seeded with (say) 128 bits of secure entropy, you can generate as much
pseudorandom output as you like without worries (unless someone breaks
the crypto, which is usually considered unlikely).  If the crypto is secure
and /dev/urandom is properly seeded, then its pseudorandom output is
indistinguishable from true random bits; this is true even if you extract
millions of pseudorandom bits.  "Entropy" is often a misleading notion,
when you are dealing with cryptographic PRNGs and computationally bounded
adversaries.
