Right. And we know NULL == 0.

I'd have had to look over the code to find out what it was initialized
to. In cases where it is not an explicit 0/NULL, I'd leave it as is. It
could also break if somebody later on changes the value of BT_DEBUG_OFF
(yes, very unlikely, but...).
Bug your friendly GCC guy to loose static initializations to zero
(shouldn't be /that/ hard to do...) instead of obfuscating kernel's code.
