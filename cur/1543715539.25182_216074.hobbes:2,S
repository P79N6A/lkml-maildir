   I belive that you forgot to make "The Point."
   And "discussion" (good vs. bad isn't discussion, but flames) went in 
wrong direction.
   Be constructive. For example: Let's aks h/w producers making at least 
glue layer open source (bsd or something), so people eventually might 
help to maintain this glue layer.
   How it can help? - producer with time may move bigger parts of driver 
into open source domains.
   How it can gets screwed? - producer might just start liking when 
someone is doing his work for him. Some license a-la GPL to not let glue 
layer to slip into binary only domain back must be in place.
   This could be a good starting point for h/w producers and linux 
comunity as a whole.
   Saying Good/Bad is just B.S. - helps no-one.
   Building bridges between comunity and producers - might improve and 
deepen relationships. And that's what I hope for.
P.S. nVidia driver might be an example: IIRC nVidia engineers were 
saying that they have four 2/3rd party code parts inside driver, which 
they are not able to open source/GPL. But open source glue layer to 
connect this "tainted" 4 parts with Linux kernel might help everyone: 
nVidia, LK and even those four companies. At least I hope for this.
