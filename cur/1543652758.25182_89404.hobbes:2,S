1msec still leave a reasonable window open IMHO. this problem would need
sequence numbers updated atomically to be solved correctly without
regard to the timing that may vary depending on the hardware IMHO (so
that it could still work on a 1Thz cpu even if it's not a pratical
matter for at least this decade).
