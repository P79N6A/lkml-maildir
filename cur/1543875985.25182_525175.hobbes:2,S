No, it really helps alot, just be _patient_. For me, I sent a series of dumb
patches at first to use ARRAY_SIZE macro instead of manual computation. Though
the patches were completely braindead, I learnt alot of stuff about how
everything works here. 
Beside sending this KJ patches, I keep reading from Understanding Linux kernel v3
and reading lots of code everyday. Yesterday my first semi-real patch was
accepted in -mm. I'm sure that day by day my patches will be more real and fix
serious issues. 
All of that wouldn't have smoothly happened without the first step, the KJ step ;).
It seems that being a developer in the kernel community is going exactly like how
code goes, _evolution_ not a revolution. You can't be responsible for a good
project directly, just take your way from a janitor to a subsystem maintaner :).
Ofcourse, unless you have an old experience in other OSs (espcifically Unix ones).
