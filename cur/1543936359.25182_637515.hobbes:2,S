The versioning approach pioneered by Christoph Lameter seems to work
reasonably well.
If you post a new version increase a version number and add it with "vXXX" to the
Subject.
Also add a short change log between versions at the bottom; e.g. v1->v2: .... etc.
Then it is always clear what is the latest'n'greatest.
