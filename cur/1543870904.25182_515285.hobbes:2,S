Running into a problem and not sure what I'm doing
wrong. Created a software raid 10 array. Everything
seems to be normal except that if you take the array
down and run e2fsck on it there are always errors,
mostly all little stuff and it recovers without losing
any data.
I'm running the latest OpenVZ kernel 2.6.18. I'm not
sure if this is a factor or not as the problem occurs
without starting any VEs.
The problem will happen most all the time. I can
format the partition, put the data on it then shut it
down and run 2efsck and there will be some errors to
fix.
In the past after running for weeks the raid array
will unexpectedly go inti read only mode due to the
errors. After running e2fsck it will run normal again.
I've never used raid 10 before (stripes on top of 2
mirrors) so I don't have anything to compare this
with. I'm just wondering if I'm doing something wrong.
I am using ACL and dir_index attributes.
If I run e2fsck twice in a row it comes up with no
errors he second time. However if I mount the /dev/md2
device and then immediately umount it and run e2fsck
again I get some errors. Here's a run I did just
mounting and unmounting immediately.
