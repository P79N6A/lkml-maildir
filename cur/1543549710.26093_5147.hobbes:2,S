Link status is not used at all in v2.2  (and would mean a rewrite of
drivers to get it)
Link status is used in v2.4.  Not all drivers support link status.  In
fact, I don't know of any that do - but it's possible now to do it.
Simply taking down the interface should be enough to remove it from
enslavement.
