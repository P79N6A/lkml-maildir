hrm?  with sendfile() i just send 32k or 64k at a time and use alarm()
or non-blocking/select() to implement timeouts.
with sendpath() i can do the same thing but i'm gonna pay a path lookup
each time... and there's no guarantee that i'm getting the same file each
time.

i wasn't suggesting avoiding sendfile/sendpath -- i just couldn't see how
to use sendpath() effectively.
explain per-socket connection timers.  are they available to the userland?
at least with the apache-2.0 i/o stuff i should be able to support
kernel-based timers.  apache-2.0 uses non-blocking/poll() to implement
timeouts -- does write() or sendfile() until there's an EWOULDBLOCK then
it calls poll()  waiting for write/timeout.  with kernel supported
timeouts i could just block in the write() and that'd be fine by me.
1.2 used alarm() ... 1.3 communicates each child's activity to the parent
through the scoreboard and the parent occasionally wakes up and sends
SIGALRM to children that are past their timeout.  (that let me get rid of
a few syscalls.)
