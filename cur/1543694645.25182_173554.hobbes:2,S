On VAIO R505RE after software suspend (either flavor), USB controller seems
to get hopelessly confused:

The relevant 'dmesg' and '.config' are contained in bugzilla:

The workaround is to 'rmmod uhci-hcd' in the hiberation script, but this
isn't a great solution for something with a file system, like a digital 
camera.  
'uhci-hcd.c' does attempt to handle suspend/resume, but that process may
be buggy.  I did make the bug seem to go away by commenting a few things
out:
	static int uhci_resume(struct usb_hcd *hcd)
	{
		struct uhci_hcd *uhci = hcd_to_uhci(hcd);
		pci_set_master(uhci->hcd.pdev);
	//	if (uhci->state == UHCI_SUSPENDED)
	//		uhci->resume_detect = 1;
	//	else {
			reset_hc(uhci);
			start_hc(uhci);
	//	}
		uhci->hcd.state = USB_STATE_RUNNING;
		return 0;
	}
Which merely suggests to me that the problem isn't intractable.  When it
awakens from hibernation, it indeed recognizes the Sony flash device and
reassigns a SCSI address accordingly.  So there may be hope...
