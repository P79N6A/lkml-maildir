No, it's still there. I ran 'echo t >/proc/sysrq-trigger' again, and
khubd did not show up in dmesg:
-bash-2.05b# echo t >/proc/sysrq-trigger
-bash-2.05b# dmesg | grep khub
-bash-2.05b# dmesg | grep SysRq
SysRq : Show State
SysRq : Show State
-bash-2.05b# ps ax | grep khubd
  163 ?        R<   633:41 [khubd]
-bash-2.05b# echo p >/proc/sysrq-trigger
-bash-2.05b# dmesg | tail -2
 =======================
SysRq : Show Regs
-bash-2.05b#
So SysRq-t doesn't show anything about khubd, and SysRq-p doesn't give
me anything at all. What else can I try?
