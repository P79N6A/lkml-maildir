Hi all,
I've put an updated version of the driver on
ftp://ftp.nc.orc.ru/pub/Linux/people/saw/kernel/eepro100.c
The main changes from the previous announce are:
 - compiles for both 2.2 and 2.3 kernels;
 - receive buffer refilling code was seriously modified after several stress
   tests;
 - TX timeout handling code was simplified; some junk added by me in the
   previous releases was removed;
 - some uninteresting bugs were fixed;
 - better debug output :-)
More detail changelog file is on the same FTP site.
Feedback is welcome.
Best regards
					Andrey V.
