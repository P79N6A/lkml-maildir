This use case works well for providing guarantee to one container. What if
I want guarantees of 100Mb and 200Mb for two containers? How do I setup
the system using limits?
Even I restrict everyone else to 700Mb. With this I cannot be sure that
the remaining 300Mb will be distributed as 100Mb and 200Mb.
