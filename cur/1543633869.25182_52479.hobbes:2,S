Hi,
  Looks like there is a problem with NFSv3 and file permissions in the DJ
kernels.
A file that is marked as executable will lose its executable flag whenever
it is written to. I suspect the proble lies in the changes to the NFS file
info cacheing in the DJ kernels at least since 2.5.20-dj1 (I was unable
to find where this change occured in the changelog).
Here is one example:
 Enter NFS mount (in this case, the NFS server is a FreeBSD 4.6 machine)
 Compile a simple program; gcc hello.c -o hello
 Result: hello has the following permissions: -rw-r--r--
 Modify the permissions manually; chmod 755 hello
 Result: hello has the following permissions: -rwxr-xr-x
Here is another:
 Enter NFS mount
 Compile a simple program; gcc hello.c -o hello
 Result: hello has the following permissions: -rw-r--r--
 Unmount the NFS mount; umount /home
 Remount the NFS mount; mount server:/home /home
 Result: hello has the following permissions: -rwxr-xr-x
Here is the final one:
 Enter NFS mount, find a file with executable permissions;
 Edit a file; vi whahoo.sh
 Save and close the file
 Results: file has the following permissions: -rw-r--r--
So, in the process of writing a file, its executable bits are lost. Can
someone help? The problem is not present with vanilla Linux-2.5.20.
