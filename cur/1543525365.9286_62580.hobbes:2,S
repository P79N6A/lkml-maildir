2.3.43 won't boot on my SMP computer, the same kernel [removable
harddisk] boots on my AMD K6.
It reboots immediately after uncompressing.
2.3.43-pre5 did boot.
Any ideas why?
I don't understand the changes in arch/i386/kernel/io_apic:
IO_APIC_get_PCI_irq_vector() contains a new local variable (best_guess)
that is never read. Weird.
Thanks,
	Manfred
