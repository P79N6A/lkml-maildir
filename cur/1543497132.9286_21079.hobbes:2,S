I've been chasing a hang in 2.2.9* and it comes down to truncate_inode_pages.
Now there are two things that have me wondering here and one cleanup item
1.	wait_on_page uses schedule() and not the SCHED_YIELD stuff so
	there is no guarantee another person locking the page gets run
	if their lock isnt going to be cleared by tq_disk
2.	__wait_on_page says you are supposed to own the page before waiting
	on it (ie up page->count). I don't see where we do that. We even
	go back to the start to allow for the pages on the inode changing
	if we sleep but we don't up the count ourselves.
3.	(minor) in truncate_inode_pages we do if(PageLocked(..))
 	wait_on_page. If we know the page is locked shouldn't we do
	__wait_on_page()
