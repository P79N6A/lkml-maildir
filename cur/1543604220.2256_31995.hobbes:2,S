Subject: sysctl interface to bootflags?

As I've said, I think it would be nice to have /proc
control over two boot flags: the DIAG bit (which switches
on (1) and off (0) the BIOS diagnostics) and the PnP-OS bit
(which switches on (0) and off (1) PnP BIOS device configuration).
Would it be a good idea to do this using the sysctl infrastructure?
If so, can someone please suggest an appropriate pathname for
the flag files?  How about "/proc/sys/BIOS/bootflags/diagnostics"
and "/proc/sys/BIOS/bootflags/PnP-OS" ?
If this is a bad idea, someone please stop me before I waste my
time implementing it.
