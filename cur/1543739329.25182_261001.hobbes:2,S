Subject: tun.c patch to fix "smp_processor_id() in preemptible code"

I was getting these traces on a SMP host:
dsor-vm2 kernel: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible code: linux/480
dsor-vm2 kernel:  [smp_processor_id+108/132] smp_processor_id+0x6c/0x84
kernel:  [pg0+945156838/1070318592] tun_chr_writev+0x14e/0x174 [tun]
kernel:  [pg0+945156917/1070318592] tun_chr_write+0x29/0x30 [tun]
kernel:  [vfs_write+189/236] vfs_write+0xbd/0xec
kernel:  [sys_write+64/108] sys_write+0x40/0x6c
kernel:  [syscall_call+7/11] syscall_call+0x7/0xb
The (very) little attached patch fixes this.
Bye,
   Alain
