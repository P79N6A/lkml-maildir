I would like very much to come up with a condition that causes it. 
Unfortunately, the only event that I know of that is associated with 
this typing. :-) There does not seem to be a method to the madness.
As for bumping the priorities, I tried them all, at least the ones 
mentioned above. I also tried the timer just for grins, after changing 
the keyboard repeat delay seemed to help a bit. None of them seemed to 
help, at least not for an extended period of time.

You may be on to something here. Booting with noapic SEEMS to help.
