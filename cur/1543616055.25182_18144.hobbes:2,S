No, I think that is the wrong domain of discourse here. We are not talking
about compilers being friendly, but rather correct. Most cetainly volatile
in Ada would not permit this optimzation (i.e. it would not be an optimization
it would be a miscompilation), and I certainly thought that in this respect
C was identical to Ada in semantics of volatile.
