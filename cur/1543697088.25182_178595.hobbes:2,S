The current 2.6.0-test9-bk22 has no microsecond-or-finer per-thread
accounting, so based on current policy and past experience you may
have to wait two years.
A leading contender for x86 and x86_64 is the perfctr patches
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/perfctr/
  which have been maintained
for a number of years (v1.0 at 2000-01-31 for Linux 2.2.14/2.3.41) and
have a following, including  
http://icl.cs.utk.edu/projects/papi/
 .
A recent patched, ready-to-install NPTL kernel happens to reside at
http://www.BitWagon.com/ftp/kernel-smp-2.4.20-20.9.perfctr2.5.5.i686.rpm
 .
For a complete profiler:

which also will run on a generic kernel in "-wallclock" mode
(TSC cycle accuracy, but not virtualized.)
