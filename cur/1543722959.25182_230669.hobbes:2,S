Sounds like an excellent idea to me.  The find_vma()s were already
bogus - no-one used the vma returned by hugepage_vma(), except to
check if it was NULL or not.  On all archs, whether the address is
hugepage or not can be determined from the address, either by walking
the pagetables or just by checking the address's range.
