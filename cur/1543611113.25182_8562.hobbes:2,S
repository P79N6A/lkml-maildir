Please try this patch, ide-scsi is over writing the io veclist (longer
story: the io_vec_list used to be embedded so memset'ing the bio would
be ok).
BTW, this could be handled smarter with the new scheme -- no need to
link the bio, more segments can be crammed into just one. Someone
playing around with making ide-scsi faster can do that though, I'm just
making it work :-)
