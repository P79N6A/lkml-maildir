The logic is wrong in there.
The problem is you cannot rely on the timer being pending as a signal
that the command completed normally.  The kernel doesn't define the
elapsed time between the eh_action semaphore going up and the process
waiting for it being scheduled.  If the timer fires within that
undefined interval, you'll think the command timed out when it, in fact,
completed normally.
