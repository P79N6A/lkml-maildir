A good thought.  I just tried it again.  The system woke up from the
first S3 sleep with nothing chewing CPU.  Just as a check, the second
S3 sleep still hangs with the repeating exregion-* messages.
I also tried vanilla 2.6.16-rc2 (which includes the latest ACPICA
releases in it), and it has the same problem.
