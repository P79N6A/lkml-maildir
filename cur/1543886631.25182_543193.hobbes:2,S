Hi Christoph!
	Well, without ioremap, the memory wouldn't normally be mapped.  Is
there something better to use?

And that's nothing to do with iremap.  They're required because guest
"physical" == host virtual, and casting a long to a "__user void *"
seems to require a __force.
I enjoy a good Hellwigging as much as anyone, but your aim is off.
