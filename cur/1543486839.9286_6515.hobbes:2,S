I am having similar problems with some K6-2/350 and VA-503+ MB's
design. Exact same symtoms, and if I move to the next lower
speed, it works fine. Replaced processors, same problem. So it is
either a widespread problem with the K6's quality control, or the
VA-503+'s. Most people blame the memory, but I've tried enough
different pieces of memory to know better, by this time.
