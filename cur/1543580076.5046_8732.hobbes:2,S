I bet that we can fix this up easily.
I bet the "translation" is just something like
	reg = pirq;
	if (reg < 5)
		reg += 0x40;
and that what happened was that SiS _originally_ only specified INTA-INTD,
and specified them as pirq link values 0x01-0x04, mapping to config
registers 0x41-0x44.
Later on they noticed that they wanted to do the other things too, and
they expanded the definition to be "for any other value, it's the config
space address".

I would prefer _not_ to see this.
Why? Because it's (a) real information what the PCI config space was, and
it might help debug things in the future. And (b) I've seen to many broken
BIOSes that do not re-initialize hardware fully over a soft boot, that I
worry that you'll get different behaviour after doing a "shutdown -r" with
this.
I'd rather not touch config space more than necessary.
