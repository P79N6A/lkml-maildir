Only a few drivers are capable of being unloaded with the possiblity of
restoring the vga console (i810fb and rivafb), when CONFIG_FBCON = n.
If CONFIG_FBCON=y, it's not possible to unload the module unless 2 drivers
are loaded at the same time. One driver can be mapped to the console, so the
other can be unloaded.  Although not important from the user's POV, it is
quite helpful when debugging/developing drivers.
Currently fbcon cannot be unloaded, it will freeze the system.
