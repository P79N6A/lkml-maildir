Instead of kernel changes, you might want to consider a user monitor task 
running at high rt priority which changes the priority of the tasks you want to 
use the new policy.  You could write an intercept routine for the scheduleset* 
calls and pass the new policy to the monitor.  More thought would be needed to 
make it inherit across a fork..
