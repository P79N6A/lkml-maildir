I went ahead and implemented the change last night anyway and I
will submit the patches and see if it will be accepted or not.
The idea is that it first check in arch/$ARCH/Configure.help
and if the file or the help is not found there,
check Documentation/Configure.help.
I believe there is an advantage from a maintenance point of view.
It least for our CRIS architecture, I don't think it's any benefit to
"bloat" the Documentation/Configure.help with a lot of
CONFIG_ETRAX entries for the various hardware inerfaces
when the help and config can be kept locally.
BTW: I added this to scripts/Configure and scripts/Menuconfig
but I know to little tcl/tk to get it to work for the xconfig case.
The variable $ARCH was not found and I don't know how to make
it get it from the environment variables.
