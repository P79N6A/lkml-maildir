It's not that simple.  You may need the per-superblock data structures for
->clear_inode() to work.
In any case, it _is_ additional rule for no good reason.  "inode may stay
in icache after iput() only when fs is up and running" is a warranty that
is trivial to provide and that removes a source of hard-to-debug screwups
in fs code.
