Eric,
The patch for bug 3049 has been in 2.6.8.1 and should fix the IO port
problem. If the Asus quirk is just because of IO port problem, I'd like
to remove it. Note PNP driver also reserves the IO port for the SMBus
and lets SMBus driver to use it. ACPI motherboard driver behaves the
same as PNP driver.
Thanks,
Shaohua
