I seem every once in a while I see discussion of the Silicon Image
3112 based SATA controller.  My motherboard, Tyan S2885, reports back
that I have a 3114.  The SI web sites boasts 20 manufacturers are now
incorporating the 3114 version of the chip.
Has anyone had any experience with the SI 3114?
Thanks,
