Not really. If I understand Russell here, that RAM has been "put aside"
for use by fancy stuff and is de-facto out of control of the normal page
allocator and refcounting. In this case, I see no reason why it couldn't
be considered as MMIO and ioremap'able :)

This is dodgy actually. memset can't be guaranteed to work on IOs or
other non-cacheable memory (including real RAM that has been mapped
non-cacheable, typically RAM that has been "set aside" for other uses as
described above, wether it's for AGP, or for some weird processor DMA
bounce buffers or whatever ..., that is RAM that is out of the normal
kernel control).
