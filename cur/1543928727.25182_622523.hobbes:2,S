That NIC is used by the NIC firmware (or the BIOS) to negotiate
the iSCSI target. The information that is in this directory is what
the BIOS used (note past tense) which might very well be completly
different from what Linux uses.
My rationale behind _not_ linking to ethX view was that it could
be confusing and not entirely useful for users: "It says that _this_
NIC, with this IP, uses this iSCSI target. But Linux is using a
completly different NIC (and IP) to setup a iSCSI connection to the
same iSCSI target!?"
