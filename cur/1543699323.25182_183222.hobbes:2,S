The LVM1 driver was removed because dm covered the same functionality
+ lots more, and is more flexible.  The LVM2 tools still understand
the LVM1 metadata format, so there is no problem about not being able
to read data in 2.6.  The main reason for submitting dm to 2.4 was
that there are a lot of people out there who want to use LVM2/EVMS
tools with 2.4, and kept asking me to do it.  If this is against
Marcelos current policy then so be it; I probably should have checked
with him before spamming lkml with the submission.  I don't want this
to degenerate into the old LVM1 vs dm argument; people can search the
archives for that.
