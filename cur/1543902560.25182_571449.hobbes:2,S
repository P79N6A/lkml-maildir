I'd suggest "This is a Japanese translated version ..." or perhaps
"This is a version of Documentation/HOWTO translated into Japanese".

I'd write "This document is maintained by ..."

Shouldn't this be something along the lines of
"Please also note that the purpose of this file is to be easier to
read for non English (read: Japanese) speakers and is not intended as
a fork. So if you have any comments or updates for this file please
try to update the original English file first."
