It seems to me that as long as /dev is always a local mount (tmpfs in
the case of an NFS-root installation), it doesn't really matter. Maintaining
system-specific information on a remote machine seems dirty, and something
that shouldn't be *expected* to work. You wouldn't expect /proc to work
over NFS, would you? :-)
