I ma sorry, but new linux users (mostly ubuntu) want their system to work out of
the box. Ruining, at least for the time being, the only decent nvidia drivers
isn't going to help. nd I don't think gamers, such as myself, will be very happy
if you proceed with this change. Enemy territory quake wars or other games won't
work anymore because their 600 $ Geforce 8 cards won't work correctly.
If I wouldn't be able to play game anymore, with ATI having bad performance on
linux, I would switch back to windows and I'm not the only one. It's as simple
as that.
Great Idea!!
