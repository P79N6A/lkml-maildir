Hi Christer,
Thanks for doing this "watchdog-api.txt".
Will you add it to linux/Documentation/ also?
Even with the FIXME's, it's valuable to have this information.
Typo:  in the 3rd paragraph following "Introduction:",
change "implent" to "implement".
Questions:  At various places it refers to
/proc/watchdog and/or /dev/watchdog special device files.
Is /proc/watchdog actually used, or just /dev/watchdog?
And is /proc/watchdog considered a special device file?
