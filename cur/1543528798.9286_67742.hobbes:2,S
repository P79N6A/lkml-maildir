Mr. Mendelson,
Does your 3c905B share an interrupt with another device?
If so:
You can, in Mr. Donald Beckers drivers, just increase the
"Max_Work_At_Interrupt = 20;" statement to a 1000.
This is a pragmatic fix but the driver is not ready for the
shared irq case and Alan Cox has been nice enough to
inform me that it would be a hard job to rewrite the driver
to actually be able to share an irq with another peripheral.
[I would like to see Mr. Becker comment on this once
for I am curious if not one of his beowulf machines with
a 3com NIC has ever 'suffered' from a shared interrupt.]
Yours,
Luuk van der Duim
