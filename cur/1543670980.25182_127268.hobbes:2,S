Moving byte swapping out of the IDE layer also means that dumping the
whole disk to a file will then give you non-byte swapped data, which
could then be written back to a disk on another machine without a
byte-swapped IDE interface.
It will also allow you to exchange tar archives on raw hard disk
devices, and have them readable on non-byte swapped IDE interfaces
:-).
