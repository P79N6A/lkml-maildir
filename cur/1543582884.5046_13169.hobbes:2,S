I didn't want to join the kernel mailing list (too much traffic) so I
sent it to the email address suggested on the reiserfs home page. I
guess it didn't get through.
It seems I am in fact using a buggy compiler (damn RedHat 7, forgot I
had upgraded on this machine) I will try re-compiling with another
compiler and let you know if I still have problems.
