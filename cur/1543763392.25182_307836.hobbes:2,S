[PATCH] I2C: Fix broken force parameter handling
I just noticed a nasty bug in the way the "force" parameter is handled
for non-sensors i2c chip drivers. The "force" parameter supposedy is a
list of adapter, address *pairs* where supported chips are
unquestionably assumed to be. However, after handling one pair, the i2c
core code searches for the next one *three* values later, not two. So
with the current code, the second and third pairs wouldn't be properly
handled. The fourth one would be, and so on.
As a side note, this questions the need of an array parameter handling
up to 24 of such pairs, when obviously nobody ever required more than
one for the past 6 years.
