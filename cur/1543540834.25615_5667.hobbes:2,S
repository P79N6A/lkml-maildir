Umm, "block size == 10MEG"?!?!  Well, right there is half your problem.
It's going to take some time to 10M zeroed buffer and then handing 10M
in one shot to the driver... the system freezes during the 10M read()
of /dev/zero.  It becomes very unresponsive during buffer flushing as
a side effect of the way SCSI command queuing works. (Once the driver
command queue is full, no more commands will be sent to the driver until
the queue is empty.  I _HATE_ that -- esp. with a DPT I2O controller that
takes _210_ commands and can take _5 MINUTES_ to execute all of them.)

change the bs=## to something smaller.  The largest block size the SCSI
layer will handle is 64k (it can theoretically go much higher, but doesn't)
