Hi
I've got a problem with sound with my VIA823x soundcard (ADI AD1980) and 
kernel-2.6 (2.4 works but uses Line-In for output, funny thing).
OSS works, but gives the following error
via_audio: ignoring drain playback error -11
via_audio: ignoring drain playback error -11
via_audio: ignoring drain playback error -11
via_audio: ignoring drain playback error -11
Assertion failed! chan->is_active == 
sg_active(chan->iobase),sound/oss/via82cxxx_audio.c,via_chan_maybe_start,line=1388
[some time later]
via_audio: ignoring drain playback error -11
via82cxxx: unknown number of channels
via82cxxx: unknown number of channels
via82cxxx: unknown number of channels
I'm using OSS becase ALSA doesn't seem to work at all (no sound):
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture Driver Version 0.9.7 (Thu Sep 25 
19:16:36 2003 UTC).
via82xx: Assuming DXS channels with 48k fixed sample rate.
         Please try dxs_support=1 option and report if it works on your 
machine.
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:11.5 to 64
codec_valid: codec 0 is not valid [0xfe0000]
codec_valid: codec 0 is not valid [0xfe0000]
[lots more]
ALSA device list:
  #0: VIA 823x rev60 at 0xe000, irq 9
Please CC me, thanks
