Well, to my surprize, linux-ppc uses UNSIGNED chars by default. It has amazed
me but it's a fact. Let's compile this little program on tux-ppc :
$ cat ints.c
#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
        int i1, i2;
        char c1, c2;
        c1 = i1 = 0;
        c1--; c2 = c1;
        i1--; i2 = i1;
        c2 &= ~(c2 >> 1);
        i2 &= ~(i2 >> 1);
        if (c1 < 0) printf("c1<0: %d\n", c1); else printf("c1>=0: %d\n",c1);
        if (c2 < 0) printf("c2<0: %d\n", c2); else printf("c2>=0: %d\n",c2);
        if (i1 < 0) printf("i1<0: %d\n", i1); else printf("i1>=0: %d\n",i1);
        if (i2 < 0) printf("i2<0: %d\n", i2); else printf("i2>=0: %d\n",i2);
}
$ gcc-3.3 -v

$ gcc-3.3 -O2 -o ints ints.c
ints.c: In function `main':
ints.c:16: warning: comparison is always false due to limited range of data type
ints.c:17: warning: comparison is always false due to limited range of data type
$ ./ints
c1>=0: 255
c2>=0: 128
i1<0: -1
i2>=0: 0
=> As you can see, 0 - 1 returns 255 as a char, and -1 & ~(-1 >> 1) = 128 !
ints are OK BTW. I'm gonna change some of my code to fix this because relying
on signed chars to to detect unassigned values (-1) is wrong !
Oh and BTW, here's the result on x86 :
$ gcc-3.3 -o ints ints.c
$ ./ints
c1<0: -1
c2>=0: 0
i1<0: -1
i2>=0: 0
Cheers,
Willy
