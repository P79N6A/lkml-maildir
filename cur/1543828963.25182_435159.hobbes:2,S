A ridiculously trivial suggestion here, but maybe just add the last
element of this table as such: {"aes", 0x09},... Not that it's overly
important, but it'll kill a couple unnecessary lines in the next patch
to this table.  Also, why not simply include the key-size in the name
(e.g. {"aes192", 0x08},}?  Granted, I haven't looked around at how this
string is being used in your code...
