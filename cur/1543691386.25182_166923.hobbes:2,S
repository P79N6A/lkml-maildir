hi!
this is my first bug-report for a kernel, so i'm sorry when it is not
perfect.
i have compiled kernel 2.4.22 and the kernel runs very good. today i
want to make menuconfig a 2. time with the same target.
cd /usr/src/linux-2.4.22
su
make menuconfig
Menuconfig has encountered a possible error in one of the kernel's
configuration files and is unable to continue.  Here is the error
report:
Please report this to the maintainer <mec@shout.net>.  You may also
send a problem report to <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>.
Please indicate the kernel version you are trying to configure and
which menu you were trying to enter when this error occurred.
make: *** [menuconfig] Fehler 1
my system:
debian sid
gcc 3.3.2
athlon 2400+
best regards
michael
