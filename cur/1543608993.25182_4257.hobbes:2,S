No.
Unsigned arithmetic is fine. The _correct_ way to test whether something
is in within
	[ start , start+HZ ]
is to do
	if (jiffies - start <= HZ)
try it. The C language guarantees that unsigned arithmetic works in a
"modulo power of two" fashion, which means that it _is_ ok to do
arithmetic on unsigned longs, and jiffy wrapping does not matter. No need
to cast to "signed" or anything else.
In short: It is wrong to do
	if (jiffies <= start+HZ)
and it is _right_ to do
	if (jiffies - start <= HZ)
(as long as "start" is "unsigned long" like jiffies).
