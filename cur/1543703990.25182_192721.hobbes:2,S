Hi all,
I've seen the mail by Martin Loschwitz of January 1st 2004, in which
he reported:
 > I'm writing this mail as I'm discovering ACPI related problems on
 > my Acer TravelMate 800LCi notebook with Linux 2.6.1-rc1-mm1.
 > While the system boots up fine with Linux 2.6.1-rc1, with
 > 2.6.1-rc1-mm1 it hangs while booting. The last message printed to
 > screen is "ACPI: IRQ 9 was Edge Triggered, setting to Level
 > Triggerd". This is fully reproducable with a Linux 2.6.0 kernel
 > which has the ACPI20031203 patch applied.
I'm now seeing the _exact same problem_ on an ASUS M2400N [*] with a
Linux 2.6.1 (unpatched) kernel. The kernel freezes after printing 
 "ACPI: IRQ 9 was Edge Triggered, setting to Level Triggerd" 
(yes, the typo is in the kernel, it seems)
I've seen no reply to his mail. Has the problem been solved or is it
still a known bug(tm)?
Martin? Were you successful in resolving that problem?
Regards,
Georg
