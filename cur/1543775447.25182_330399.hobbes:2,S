Doesn't OpenOffice already do something similar with zipfiles?  I 
remember noticing huge differences in save times after adding large 
images to a presentation versus just changing some text.  So, it's 
obviously not repacking each image every time I save.  But, as the 
internal text is all XML, I doubt it's leaving "deleted" sections lying 
around.

Been discussed to death, and chances are, Reiser4 will do this with 
plugins.  I imagine it being implemented in a more general way, though. 
  For example, a meta-file which, when read, produces a 
zipfile/tarball/dump of the directory it belongs to.  Then, to send such 
a document via email, you just navigate to the directory where it lives 
while looking for files to attach, only from /meta/vfs as a base, then 
attach the meta-file.  The zipfile gets built automatically.
To simplify the process, all you *really* need is a button on all FS 
navigation windows (Nautilus, Open/Save dialogs, etc) to switch back and 
forth between the meta view and the normal view.  That, or a separate pane.
This way, instead of patching the mail client to support all possible 
transformations you'd want to do before sending, or patching all 
applications to use zip (and any other transformation a user might want 
to do), or forcing the user to run another app, you automatically get 
*all* available transformations, in a way that could potentially look as 
smooth as adding zip support directly to the app.

All good points except the last one.  New tools vs new plugins?  People 
already know how to write the tools...

That, and the possible paradigm shift.  Navigating to the /meta dir for 
a file could be the commandline equivalent of right-clicking on the file.
Of course, to some people, paradigm shifts are a reason *not* to bother...
