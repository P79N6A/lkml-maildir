Don't you mean something much much bigger in the TB range??

ATA-6 Expanded Addressing
Introduction:
A method is described for expanding the addressable capacity of devices.
Current protocols support a maximum 28-bit LBA, which corresponds to a device
capacity of about 137GB. The proposal also includes increasing the maximum
sector count for a single command from 256 to 65536.
Description:
The optional Expanded Addressing feature increases the maximum addressable
capacity of a device from 137GB to 1.44E17 bytes, or 1.44E5 TB.  This is
accomplished by increasing the maximum LBA range from 28 bits to 48 bits.
In order to transfer a 48-bit LBA, 2 complete writes of the Task File
registers is required.  During the first write sequence, all Task File
registers except the Command register are written. During the
second write sequence, the Command register is also written.
