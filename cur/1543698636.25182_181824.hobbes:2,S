That's not true.  Trigger support is identical in both versions.

Right.  Your problem is deciding which trees you want to track.  There is 
Linus/Marcelo trees but there are probably another 200+ trees of the kernel
on bkbits.net and who knows how many elsewhere (we've counted over 10,000
before we stopped counting).  Obviously you don't want to track all of those
but some of them might be interesting.
