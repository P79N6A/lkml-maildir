The /dev/epoll usage is IMHO very simple. Once the I/O fd is created you
register it with POLLIN|POLLOUT and you leave it inside the monitor set
until it is needed ( mainly until you close() it ). It is not necessary to
continuosly switch the event mask from POLLIN and POLLOUT. An hypothetical
syscall API should look like :
int sys_epoll_create(int maxfds);
void sys_epoll_close(int epd);
int sys_epoll_addfd(int epd, int fd, int evtmask);
int sys_epoll_wait(int epd, struct pollfd **pevts, int timeout);
with the option ( if benchmarks will give positive results ) like Ben
suggested, of using the AIO event collector instead of sys_epoll_wait().
