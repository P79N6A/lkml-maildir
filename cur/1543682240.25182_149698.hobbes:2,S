bigpages= is a documented API that has to be used in production, so I
can easily add the hugetlbfs API but I guess I've to keep this one
anyways. I also would need to verify the performance of hugetlbfs before
suggesting migrating to it, for example I don't want
preallocation/prefaulting (IIRC hugetlbfs preallocates everything). I
also like the single huge array of page pointers, that is very hardwired
but optimal for those workloads.
