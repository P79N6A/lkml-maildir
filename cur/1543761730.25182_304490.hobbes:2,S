Ok, so let's
    printk("You booted another kernel than you suspended with.\n");
    printk("You have two options now:\n");
    printk(" - boot the kernel you suspended with\n");
    printk(" - pass 'noresume' at boot and mkswap your swap partition "
           " later\n");
    printk("Try again, player 1!\n");
    panic();

yes, but you need user input etc. Not considered a good idea IIRC.
Anyway, the hard thing to do is to find out when to bail out and when
not. The part that handles the user interface is the easier one :-)
