No. select() and write() must agree when -EAGAIN happens.
write() will fail if write_room() returns 0. Additionally, we want to 
delay wakeups a bit, to reduce context switches.
The problem is that the console driver implements stopping by returning 
0 from ->write_room() - therefore "less than WAKEUP_CHARS in buffer" is 
not equivalent to "write will not return -EAGAIN", and thus user space 
loops. My patch fixes that by checking ->write_room() in normal_poll.
Perhaps the Right Thing (tm) is

 >        mask |= POLLOUT | POLLWRNORM;
but I simply to not understand the tty layer at all, thus I proposed the 
minimal patch.
