Notice that I did qualify with "possibly".  Am not 100% up to speed on
the libata, although it did appear clean, and I am attempting to get
to total understanding.  My perception at this time is that the PATA
controllers is where the bulk of the work would be needed.  If that is
not true, then great, the kernel is much further along.
Do you have any test cases that are normally run?  Assuming that if
these did it exist, they would be more manually than ant kind of
automated.

I would have to differ with you here.  From conversations and fairly
(2 or 3 months ago) experience, the IDE core is not capable of being
unloaded.

Educational question, what would I be looking for when grokking code
to see this is in place?

Yes, the drivers are in the mainline.  Just not sure of how many
platforms will have non-pluggable controllers that need to have them
hot-plugged. :-)

Ok, please delineate.  Working off the assumption that 95+% of the
systems that run Linux are x86 based, and have a single partition for
the system. In other words, no virtual processors, where each is
totally separate from the other.

None, in the sense that notification is already present, and no new
mechanism is required, or none in the sense that if a hotplug event
occurs, no one cares?

Again, going back to my original premise, that is, which platforms do
you foresee needing this capability?  I know that all should have
eventually.
