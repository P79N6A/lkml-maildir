The device got removed from bus->devices, so I can't call that.
pci_do_scan_bus would probably the correct function to call.
But it isn't aware of already existing devices and doesn't allow
to add the hotplug slot after discovering new devices.
Well I could walk the device tree afterwards and find unbound
devices. Still pci_scan_slot would rescan and reenable all devices.
What do I overlook?
Thanks,
