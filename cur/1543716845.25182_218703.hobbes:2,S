There is a significant amount of work pending in the DRM development tree
at 
http://drm.bkbits.net/drm-2.6
 (which is included in -mm).  Andrey's
zeroeth patch alone tosses three rejects against it.
David, now would be a good time to start getting that code ready for a
merge.
Andrey, you should rebase your patches on top of the DRM tree, or -mm, and
copy David on the emails.
Thanks.
