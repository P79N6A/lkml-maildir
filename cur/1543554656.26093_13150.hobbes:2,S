Hi everyone.
I have noticed that some kernel modules are installed under
/lib/modules/XXX/misc,
instead of /net. I have been checking the drivers/net/Makefile (little knowledge
of 
kernel make infraestructure...), and MOD_LIST_NAME is set properly, but the only
content of modules/NET_MODULES is dummy.o.
There is no important issue, but that i build newer net drivers got from Scyld,
and
installed them under modules/XXX/net. But modprobe was still getting the old
ones,
because 'misc' is before 'net'...
Kernel is plain standard kernel 2.2.17 + 2.2.18-pre21-patch + VM-patch + i2c-lm
patch.
I will dig into the makefiles, but someone has a clue ? Perhaps this also
affects
other modules.
