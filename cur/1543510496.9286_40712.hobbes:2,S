Anytime we run knfsd on our Alpha systems and export data, after 2 days the
server will die.  The kernel says up but all IO functions stop operating,
network wise ports open but other than that the system sits there dead.
There are no logs or other data to point exactly at knfsd, but the systems
only die when we use nfs, and the client seems to be ok, it's just the server.
