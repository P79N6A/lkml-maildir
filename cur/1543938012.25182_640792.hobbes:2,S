ioremap() does alloc_page and that won't work before 
paging_init(). Early ACPI scan is before paging_init() because
paging_init() needs node discovery at at least; which requires
some ACPI tables.

I didn't think there were enough early/bt_ioremap() users for this
to be really worthwhile. The only code that does both I'm aware of
is the memory setup code.
