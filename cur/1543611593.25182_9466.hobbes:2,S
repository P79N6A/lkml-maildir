I'm sure I'm not the only one who would like to know which stock kernels 
are relatively stable, and which ones aren't. There must be at least two
more people, just like me, who wonder which stock kernel to use.
Just because I like to apply a few patches that my distributor doesn't 
ship doesn't mean that I want to play russian roulette with my system,
though I'm willing to risk the occasional bug or problem when
I compile my own kernel.
And the kernels on kernel.org *are* tested, by lots of people, by kernel 
developers, by lots of ordinary folks even. I bet right after theren's 
an announce on slashdot you see lots of traffic on the ftp/http sites.
After a week or two I bet you even have some pretty good idea which
stock kernels are relatively stable, and which ones have big issues.
The word "relatively" is important here, everyone knows that if you roll 
your own kernel you're facing some risks. But everyone also knows that 
for some of the stock kernels the risks are reasonable, and for some of
them the risks are unreasonable.
I'm not asking for any additional testing, I'm just asking someone to 
summarize the consensus about a kernel once it's been kicked around 
for a week or two.
