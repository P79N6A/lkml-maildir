Yes, that's precisely what I meant, thanks!
The point is that it's hard to work out where all the maintainer trees
are, and git makes rebasing an easy exercise, so you just prepare your
patch set against one version of linux-next ... you can rebase it to
future versions as much as you like until you're ready with
git-send-email to send off the patch sets.  Linux-next is only useless
as a base for an upstream git tree; it makes a good work ground for a
volatile one that's essentially only holding patches for onward
transmission (as patches not as a git tree).
I suppose the caveat is that you have to be intimately familiar with how
git rebase works, so this course of action isn't for the faint of heart.
