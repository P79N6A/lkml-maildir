What is complex in there ? I agree it's not convenient to do this from
the very low level ones that don't take the pci_dev * as an argument,
but from the higher level ones that does, the overhead is basically to
test a flag in the pci_dev, I doubt it will be significant in any way
performance wise, especially compared to the cost of a config space
access...
