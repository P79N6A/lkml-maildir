It occurs when you reference an unmapped address (e.g. NULL)

Yes you should. GFP_ATOMIC means don't sleep.
GFP_KERNEL can sleep to swap pages out to free memory and can be only
used in process context. Interrupt handlers and most of the networking
input path run in interrupt context and cannot sleep.
