Evgeniy,
Please send networking patches to netdev@oss.sgi.com.
Your connector code (under drivers/connector) is now in the -mm tree and 
as far as I can tell, has not received any review from the network 
developers.
Looking at it briefly, it seems quite unfinished.
I'm not entirely sure what it's purpose is.
A clear explanation of its purpose would be helpful (to me, at least), as 
well as documentation of the API and majore data structures (which akpm 
has also asked for, IIRC).
I can see one example of where it's being used with kobject_uevent, and it 
seems to have arrived via Greg-KH's I2C tree...
If you're trying to add a generic, psuedo-reliable Netlink communication 
system, perhaps this should be built into Netlink itself as an extension 
of the existing Netlink API.
I don't think this should be done as a separate "driver" off somewhere 
else with a new API.
A few questions:
- Why does it by default use NETLINK_NFLOG a kernel socket, and also allow 
this to be overriden by a module parameter?
- Why does the cn.o module (poor namespace choice) add a callback itself
on initialization?
- Where is the userspace code which uses this?  I checked out dbus from 
cvs and couldn't see anything obvious.
Thanks,
- James
