Are you planning to run it on a more recent kernel too?  Some of the
nfsd reports clearly good finds (thanks, I'll make patches), but a lot
of them are in bits of the code that have changed recently (from a quick
check, I think that at least err1-32, err1-33, err1-42, from Andrew
Morton's list, have been fixed).
