There are bugfixes which are too big for stable or -rc releases, that are
queued for 2.6.20. "Bugfix only" is a relative statement. Do you include,
new hardware support, new security api's, performance fixes.  It gets to
be real hard to decide, because these are the changes that often cause
regressions; often one major bug fix causes two minor bugs.
Interestingly, adding a new feature often causes no bugs in the rest
of the code, but it does increase the possible bug surface so most of
the problems related to feature X are bugs in feature X.
