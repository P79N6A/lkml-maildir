I'm very happy with 2.4.17rc2aa2.  Some things I've run on it:
Laptop PII with 192MB RAM
15 simultaneous copies of crash01 doing 10,000,000 iterations each.
crash01 generates random code and executes it.  This ran for over
36 hours and the test completed normally.  An earlier 2.4.x
kernel locked up or rebooted on the first iteration.  Similarly,
crash02 tests (execute random syscalls) runs for long periods
with no problems.  (both of these tests could be dangerous, so
be careful with them).
K6-2/500 with 384MB RAM.
Several executions of Linux Test Project run all tests as well as
crash tests. 
Athlon 1333 with 1024 MB RAM.
12 simultaneous "./configure && make -j 30" of the kde-2.2.2 source
packages (addons admin artwork base bindings games graphics libs 
multimedia network pim sdk toys utils kdevelop.
This put a load of 40 - 90 on the system for the duration of the
run.  (about 2 hours in total - only hits swap for a few minutes,
on this machine).

LTP regression
2.4.17rc2aa1 and 2.4.17rc2aa2 do consistently have a regression on one test, which 
passes on 2.4.17-rc1 and 2.4.17-rc2:
nanosleep02    1  FAIL  :  Remaining sleep time doesn't match with the expected 4 time
nanosleep02    1  FAIL  :  child process exited abnormally
These aren't VM tests, per se.  However, I found myself going back to this kernel
whenever I had a problem with 2.5.2-pre1.
All of the 2.4.17* kernels have been stable on my systems.  For performance, 
I give the nod to the aa kernels.
