Yes.
Regardless, it would certainly make sense to have a manual override, with
a kernel command line. If for no other reason than to allow for mistakes
and let the user force the old/new behaviour.
So the #define should be a variable with a kernel command line override,
along with a heuristic for the kernel to do a good guess on its own (and
the heuristic should probably not be as global as the current
"pcibios_assign_all_busses()" test - the heuristic will be able to tell on
a bridge basis on whether that bridge may need assignment. This might
imply giving the "pcibios_assign_all_busses()" thing the "dev" as an
argument).
