But less clarity about which name goes with which device. I think it's 
desirable to have a way for the user, the non-guru user, to find out 
what meaningless name goes with which actual device. Currently finding 
out what's on a system involves /proc/ide/hd*/model and /proc/scsi/scsi 
to see what's attached and what names are being used.
For discussion I suggest /proc/ata/devices, a single flat file matching 
a name meaningful to open() with a vendor string and whatever other info 
is handy, like serial number and the like. If people are going to use 
ATA that allows them to generate their own tools using familiar methods 
like awk, sed, grep, perl, python or whatever. Having that information 
in an inobvious format will really slow adoption by triggering the "it's 
hard to use" or "I need to use all these new tools" responses.
And those responses are not limited to newbies, experienced users are 
aware of the ratio of learning curve to functionality as well.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
