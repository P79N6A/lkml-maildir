You can't have it both way, really.  If we are talking about annotating
a codebase we _can_ annotate, that one is not a problem at all.  If we
are talking about vanilla C project that never heard about sparse...
We can define whatever extensions we like, but such project has to
cope with whatever C compilers they had been using.
So "sparse believes that this defintion of offsetof can be used as
array size" will mean fsck-all outside of #ifdef __CHECKER__ and
under such ifdef we can always define it to builtin; if anything,
that will be faster and easier on sparse.
