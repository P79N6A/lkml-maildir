The exact same kernel runs fine on my other test boxes. But i really don't 
have faith in this compiler, it's the same one which constantly seems to be 
tripping into various problems.

I just tried the RH9 2.96 and it also triple faulted. Oh my.. The only 
unique thing about this hardware compared ot the other stuff i have here 
is that it's an AMD K6. Everything else is Intel.
