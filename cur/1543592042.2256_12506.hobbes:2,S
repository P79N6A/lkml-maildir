Greetings,
I wanted to repost this zr36120 patch, both because so far it has gone 
unnoticed, and because there was a problem with the text formatting which 
is now fixed.
There is a bug in zr36120.c of not freeing memory on error paths.  This one 
is particularly dangerous, because kmalloc allocates a memory block the 
size of an entire video clip!  I simply free the local pointer, vcp, before 
returning -EFAULT.
Philip
