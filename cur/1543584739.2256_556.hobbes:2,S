interestingly, I have exactly the same problems when booting my smp kernel
with either maxcpus=1, nosmp or the second cpu removed but NOT when the
kernel boots with two cpus (it works *perfectly*)
Unless macpus=! switches off apic (it doens't) this doesn't look like a
IRAQ problem, as the bios has no idea of the maxcpus=! option.
One thing that puzzles me is why the new driver looks for db_185.h in
/usr/include/db, which seems to be a rather nonstandard position for that
header (none my my slackware or home-grown boxes have that directory, all
of them have the db_185.h file in /usr/include, which is the standard
location I'd think since glibc-2.1 installed it there).
