true, we could turn pr_debug() calls into printk(KERN_DEBUG) calls, but there
is an overhead to all these extra printk functions calls. The way I have
implemented pr_debug(), there is no function call at all, in the off case.
To me pr_debug() is currently a compile option, b/c there is often a lot of
overhead to having it on. Being able to turn pr_debug() calls off/on in a
production environment, to get debugging data seems very valuable.
