spurious faults happen all the time on SMP, in the native kernel.
And what i mean is that Linux mprotect currently does not take advantage 
of x86's ability to just change the ptes, because there's no structured 
way to tell mm/mprotect.c that "it's safe to skip the TLB flush here". 
The flush happens in mm/mprotect.c's change_protection() function:
        flush_tlb_range(vma, start, end);
and that is unnecessary when we increase the protection rights, such as 
in a RO->RW change. (all that is needed is an smp_wmb() instead, to make 
sure all the pte modifications are visible when the syscall returns.)
and it's a really rare case these days that you can find an area where 
Linux does not make use of a hardware MMU feature - so we should fix 
this ;-)
