How do you create the structure that contains the class device?  What
will happen if a user holds a reference to the class device and your
structure holding that class device goes away?
Ick, I think I agree more and more with Al Viro that exposing this kind
of stuff to developers was a big mistake...
Anyway, why not try using the class_simple interface instead?  If you do
that you don't have to worry (as much) in the reference counting logic.
