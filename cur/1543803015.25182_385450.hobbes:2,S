The IDE driver probably shouldn't have allowed the bdev to be opened in
the first place.
After that happened, mount attempted to fill the superblock and the I/O
failed.  Upon failure, get_sb_bdev() called deactivate_super()
(fs/super.c line 718) and all hell broke loose.
        - deactivate_super() called fs->kill_sb() (super.c line 176) which
          pointed to kill_block_super() (fs/isofs/inode.c line 1411)
        - kill_block_super() called kobject_uevent() with action KOBJ_UMOUNT
          (Question: why is it sending UMOUNT for a mount that never happened?)
        - kobject_uevent() called kobject_get_path() and one of the objects
          had a null kobject.name, which caused strlen() to oops.
There seem to be several bugs here:
(1) IDE shouldn't have allowed the bdev to be opened.
(2) (maybe) kobject_uevent shouldn't have been called for an unmount event
    when the mount never succeeded.
(3) kobject_get_path() shouldn't oops when a path component has a NULL name,
    or else kobject should fail registration of any such object.

If you attempt to mount the CD a second time, mount will hang in D state; ps(1)
reports it's at text.lock.super.  System cannot be cleanly shut down after that --
shutdown(8) hangs and so does sync(1).
