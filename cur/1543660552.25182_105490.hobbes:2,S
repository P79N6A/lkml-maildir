Interesting, but it didn't boot completely.
It came all the way to mount root from /dev/md0  (dirty raid1)
freed 316k of kernel memory, and then nothing happened.
numloc and capslock worked, and so did sysrq.
It was as if the kernel "forgot" to run init.
Nothing happened, but it wasn't hanging either.
sysrq "show pc" told me something about default idle.
I noticed that the root raid-1 came up dirty. (2.5.X
seems unable to shut down a raid-1 device "clean" if
it  happens to be the root fs.  So there's _always_
a bootup resync that starts as soon as the raid
is autodetected. (Before mounting root)
This is a UP P4, preempt, no module support,
compiled with gcc 2.95.4 from debian.
Stock 2.5.59 works, the only config change is to enable
that new CONFIG_HANGCHECK_TIMER.
