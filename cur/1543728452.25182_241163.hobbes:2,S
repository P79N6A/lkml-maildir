It might be possible, but is probably quite a lot of work.

Not if MOSIX still has the problem that when one machine
crashes, you lose all the processes that started on that
system or have any services running on that system.
Also, IPC across the network isn't very fast, so it may
be better for performance if all the processes from a
single virtual system run on one physical system...
