But I am using multiples of page size in both buffer alignment and
buffer size (2nd and 3rd parameters of read). The issue is that when I
try to read files with sizes that are NOT multiples of block size (and
therefore also not multiples of page size), the read syscall returns 0,
with no errors. With files of size 4096, 8192 etc, everything works
fine. The errors shouldn't occur indeed, as I am using the correct
alignment and size to read. So the question remains, am I able to read
just files whose size is a multiple of block size?
Thanks,
Bruno.
