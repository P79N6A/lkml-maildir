Subject: [PATCH] m32r - New architecure port to Renesas M32R processor
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello, Linus and folks,
We have ported Linux to the M32R processor, which is a 32-bit RISC embedded
microprocessor of Renesas Technology.
I would like to release a patch information for this m32r port.
Would you merge them to the stock kernel?
# Unfortunately, I have linux-2.4.19 based kernel, not latest one.
Patch information is slightly bigger, so I placed it on our 
Linux/M32R homepage.

This new architecture port has already reported at OLS2003.
