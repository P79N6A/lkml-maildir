There's plenty of room in unsigned long long size, yes, but si.totalram
is only an unsigned long, so the arithmetic as you have it starts out
overflowing an unsigned long.
I don't know yet what it should say: RH2.96-110 is getting confused
by the do_div(size, 100) I have there (to respect Xavier's point),
and this is definitely _not_ worth adding a compiler dependency for.
