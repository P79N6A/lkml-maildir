Larger does not always mean slower.  If it did, nobody would implement a
loop unrolling optimization.
ex. Look at how GCC generates jump tables for switch() when there's about
10-12 (or more) case's sparsely scattered in the rage from 0 through 255.
It generates a 256 element directly indexed jump table (obviously with many
duplicate entries).  This is faster than a cascaded if/else
construct(particularly for those that would have been on the end of the
if/else chain), but it is a very large construct.  You'll see some of these
"plump" switches generated in various SCSI drivers and in the VT102
emulation if you disassemble them.
