I cannot post the E820 memory map, I have no way to capture it, I cannot 
get anything from netconsole and dmesg does not show it either.
BEFORE:
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size=2048MB: write-back, count=1
reg01: base=0x80000000 (2048MB), size=1024MB: write-back, count=1
reg02: base=0xc0000000 (3072MB), size= 256MB: write-back, count=1

AFTER:
$ cat /proc/mtrr
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size=2048MB: write-back, count=1
reg01: base=0x80000000 (2048MB), size=1024MB: write-back, count=1
reg02: base=0xc0000000 (3072MB), size= 256MB: write-back, count=1
reg03: base=0xcf800000 (3320MB), size=   8MB: uncachable, count=1
reg04: base=0xcf700000 (3319MB), size=   1MB: uncachable, count=1
reg05: base=0x100000000 (4096MB), size=4096MB: write-back, count=1
reg06: base=0x200000000 (8192MB), size= 512MB: write-back, count=1
reg07: base=0x220000000 (8704MB), size= 128MB: write-back, count=1
But that still works.
