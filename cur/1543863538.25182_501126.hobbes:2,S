Subject: [PATCH 2.6.20] sata_nv: don't rely on NV_INT_DEV indication with ADMA
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

OK, here it is in full signed-off glory. Hopefully we can get this in 
for 2.6.20.

Several people reported issues with certain drive commands timing out on 
sata_nv controllers running in ADMA mode. The commands in question were 
non-DMA-mapped commands, usually FLUSH CACHE or FLUSH CACHE EXT.
 From experimentation it appears that the NV_INT_DEV indication isn't 
always set when a legitimate command completion interrupt is received on 
a legacy-mode command, at least not on these controllers in ADMA mode. 
When a command is pending on the port, force the flag on always in the 
irq_stat value before calling nv_host_intr so that the drive busy state 
is always checked by ata_host_intr.
This also fixes some questionable code in nv_host_intr which called 
ata_check_status when a command was pending and ata_host_intr returned 
"unhandled". If the device interrupted at just the wrong time this could 
cause interrupts to be lost.
