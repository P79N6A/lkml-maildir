Hi All,
  Located on linuxppc64.org or on ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/tgall
you will find a port of the linux kernel to the ppc64 architecture in the form
of patches against 2.4.4.
  This is NOT an official submission quite yet but we are interested in comments
on what has been done thus far. So if any of you have some spare moments, by all
means I look forward to any and all comments. 
  Regards,
  Tom
