Since 2.6.0 and on I've had problems with mounting up my Archos Jukebox
MP3 player.  In the 2.4.20 kernel I used to:
Power on the unit
plug in the USB cable
modprobe usb-storage
  (scsi disk is compiled in)
mount /dev/sda1
Debian Unstable
{1}:/home/nomad>lspci -v | grep -i usb
00:1f.2 USB Controller: Intel Corp. 82801BA/BAM USB (Hub #1) (rev 05) (prog-if 00 [UHCI])
00:1f.4 USB Controller: Intel Corp. 82801BA/BAM USB (Hub #2) (rev 05) (prog-if 00 [UHCI])
"hotplug" autoloads the module for my visor and it is working properly.
When I plug in archos it sees a device but says there's no module for
the device.
Now when I modprobe usb-storage it hangs the shell and pretty much the
machine.  No real output, it just sits there.  I've had this same
behavior in 2.6.0-test1, test2 and test2-mm3.
If someone wishes to give me some debug commands to run or alternate
compile options feel free.
