Kernel 2.4.20-rc2 freezes after the framebuffer initialization message for 
ATYFB... same kernel without it doesn't freeze...
This is an old problem that has been there for several kernels...
Graphics cards:
  Bus  0, device  10, function  0:
    VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc 3D Rage Pro 215GP (rev 
92).
      IRQ 9.
      Master Capable.  Latency=32.  Min Gnt=8.
      Prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xde000000 [0xdeffffff].
      I/O at 0xdc00 [0xdcff].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe0000000 [0xe0000fff].
  Bus  1, device   0, function  0:
    VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV20 [GeForce3 Ti200] (rev 
163).
      IRQ 5.
      Master Capable.  Latency=248.  Min Gnt=5.Max Lat=1.
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xdc000000 [0xdcffffff].
      Prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xd4000000 [0xd7ffffff].
      Prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xd8000000 [0xd807ffff].
Kernel options:
CONFIG_FB_ATY and CONFIG_FB_ATY_CT and CONFIG_FB_RIVA
Tried disabling RIVA...results are the same...
..yet the NVidia card could be related somehow, because I remember ATYFB 
working when I didn't have the geforce..
SYSRQ has no effect after freeze
