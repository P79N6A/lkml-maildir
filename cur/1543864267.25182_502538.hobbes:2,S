I have 2 machine that oops with these cards.
1) The bios has the option to enable/disable option roms on individual PCI
slots.  I have an AHA-39160 and an AHA-2940U/UW (dual channel).  If I
disable option roms, the driver oopses when accessing the 2nd card.
I can get the oops if really needed as I don't like rebooting this machine.
2) I have an AHA-39160 with Apple/Mac firmware.  When attempting to use it
on a PC, the driver oopses presumably because the card wasn't initialized or
something.  I realize this is probably not a supported configuration, but I
don't believe that it should be oopsing.
I can get the oops for this one if it'll help.
