There are some frame buffers with that requirement. The stuff I've looked
at where the are such timing rules already disables interrupts.
(The other classic btw is older PIO IDE setups)

Think about profiling registers, mtrrs, msrs, and so forth. For example
if we had thread handling MCE traps we would hit a problem. As it happens
MCE is an interrupt so its all nice.
