I might have caused some confusion.  You had asked if any drivers
support MSI but not MSI-X, so I threw 2 drivers out there that currently
support both, and why we support MSI for compatibility.

MSI-X doesn't make much sense if you have 1 Rx queue on your NIC, since
1 vector essentially acts like MSI.  In the case of why MSI-X could
fail, I have had it fail when I misconfigured my driver and didn't ask
for enough vectors for what I was assigning, so the driver disabled the
multiple Rx queues, and fell back to MSI.
I hope this helps.
