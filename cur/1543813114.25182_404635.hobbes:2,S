You are mixing two different things. Binary driver is not the same thing 
as binary-only driver. Being binary means just that the driver is 
distributed as a precompiled module. However the driver may still be open 
sourced (under GPL or whatever license you like). The full source 
code may be shipped with the installable binary or be distributed in some 
other way for users who want to compile it themselves. 
In fact all Linux distributions ship binary drivers. The user can install 
the kernel/driver sources but most "ordinary" users don't install them. 
Best regards,
Hannu
