You only need to trap rdtsc if you know that some unsyncronizing event has
happened.  E.g. 'hlt' or some other sleep state.  If we sync every time we
hlt, then we don't need to trap.  But we can maybe be lazier about it.
The sync operation itself may not be cheap, and it may be useful to skip
it if possible.
