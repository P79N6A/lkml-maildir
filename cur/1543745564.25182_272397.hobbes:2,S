And on what basis?  This just doesn't make sense.
CONFIG_MTD_XIP is there to be compatible with kernels which are made 
XIP.  This currently means _all_ ARM flavours the kernel currently 
supports.  Yet there is only SA11x0 and PXA2xx which have proper MTD_XIP 
primitives ence the #error.
My position is therefore that the CONFIG_MTD_XIP should depend on 
CONFIG_XIP_KERNEL since this is what it is for, and the #error stay as 
is.  If ever you make x86 kernel XIPable you'll need to add the missing 
bits guarded by the #error anyway.
And no, allyesconfig makes little sense on ARM as it has been discussed 
on lkml before.
