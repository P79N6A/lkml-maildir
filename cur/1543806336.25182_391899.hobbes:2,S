Hi,
Why cannot existing block layer hook be used for this?
Why are you adding LED_FULL event handling to a specific
device driver (ide-disk) but LED_OFF event handling to a generic
IDE end request function?
This solution has very limited flexibility (disk accesses for
all IDE ports will be registered as coming from the same
source) but I guess it is fine?
Thanks,
Bartlomiej
