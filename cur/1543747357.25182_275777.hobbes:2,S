You can use filp_open().

[Jon M. Hanson] I tried the filp_open() approach like this:
struct file *mem_fd;
mem_fd = filp_open("/dev/mem", O_RDONLY | O_LARGEFILE, 0);
I then have a check if IS_ERR(mem_fd) is true immediately afterwards
along with a printk saying it failed. This condition is true when I ran
it. It seems to fail with -EACCES (permission denied) as the error code.
I can see the exact code that's causing the -EACCES in open_namei(). It
makes a check if the thing being opened is a character device and
returns the -EACCES, so obviously filp_open() can't do this.
I can run a program as root and open /dev/mem and read it without any
problems. Surely there is a way to do the same thing within a kernel
module.
