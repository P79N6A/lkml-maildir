Good Morning,
	I am making a Linux kernel with three module.  At the end of the
make process, depmod shows an error:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------
  Unresolved symbol in /lib/modules/linux-2.4.2_hhl20/kernel/driver/... .o
     __wake_up_sync
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------
	Upon further investigation of the offending module, I found the
symbol, __wake_up, was successfully mangled, but not, __wake_up_sync.
	What is going on here.  The other two modules don't have this
problem.  What is the "magic" needed to solve this problem.
TIA
	John E. Harbold
