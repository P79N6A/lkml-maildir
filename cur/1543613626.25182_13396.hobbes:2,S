I've got the devfs patch ready, I'm just waiting for followups on bug
reports from people. I was also hoping to get feedback from Al about
the blkdev+devfs races, but he hasn't followed up. I was going to send
it to you once I've gotten those followups. But if you want to apply
the patch anyway (and thus defer some testing to -rc2), let me know
and I'll send it off to you. I'm assuming that Al's silence means he
hasn't managed to poke holes in my solution :-)
Either way, I'm pretty confident that my current patch is an
improvement, even it it doesn't fix everything.
