	I think perhaps I'm asking the wrong question.  The problem I
have is the whole /dev/sd?? stuff.  devfs allows for /dev/dsk/c0t0...
kind of addressing, which to me makes alot more sense and is easier
for me to work with.  I don't see a way to do this (currently) in
user space.  
	Perhaps the problem is that SCSI major/minor numbers are
not addressed in a way that I would find useful.  Or are there other
major/minor numbers addressed to scsi that are addressed wrt controller
and target?  Of course, if you then have to create all of them before
booting because of bootstrapping issues, well, that's a heck of alot
of devices...

	Hmm, I think maybe the question is, which way is it driven?
Does the kernel automagically load the driver when the device is
detected, or does the user attempt to access a device, which the kernel
then has to go out and see if it exists (And if it can load a module
for it).  I've seen it both ways.  
	If the kernel detects it, then having a user-space daemon 
running that handles the modprobe or whatnot and the creation of the 
devices will work (pcmcia seems to work in this way).  However, what 
about devices that exist at all times in a system, but are compiled by 
the user as modules to perhaps save memory?  Or the issue with printers
and zip drives, where IIRC the user can rmmod and insmod the appropriate
modules depending on which device he wants to talk to.
	I don't know if devfs handles all of these or not, I'm just
trying to bring up points where it would be nice to have something that
handles these different situations, and handles them in One way (if at
all possible) to make it easier for the user.
