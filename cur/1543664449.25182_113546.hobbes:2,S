So you are trying a "home-brew" DOS-EMU which already exists and works
well.
emm386.exe attempts to go to protected mode. That's how it works.
That's how it's able to make "high-RAM" appear in "low-RAM" windows
for the emm386 specification. Of course it will fail when you
are in virtual 386 mode. The real DOS-EMU emulates the extended/expanded
memory specification so you don't need this in 'config.sys'. I sometimes
boot real DOS usinf DOS-EMU and it works fine. You need to configure
it so it will look at, say config.emu, instead of the DOS config.sys.
That way, you can keep boot-specific configuration files.
