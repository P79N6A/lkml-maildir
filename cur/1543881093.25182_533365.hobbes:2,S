Yes, that sounds the most sane.
Ram, what do you think?

We don't want to treat root_user special.  That's what capabilities
were invented for.

That coudl work if we wouldn't have to worry about breaking the user
interface.  As it is, we cannot be sure, that existing callers of
mount(2) don't have fsuid set to some random value.

I think we do want to treat "owned" mounts special, rather than
treating user=0 mounts special.

OK, can you ellaborate, what the uid namespace benifits are?
