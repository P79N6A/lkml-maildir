Subject: [RFC] FW: proposal for systems that do not require security

Hi,
I have an idea: I have a couple of linux-systems running in a intranet which
is not connected to do outside world in any way. Since they're only used for
calculations for which there is no harm if anyone would tamper with them,
security is not neccessary. The only thing important, is performance. Huge
amounts of data must be transferred inbetween these boxes.
So, I was wondering: isn't it a nice idea to have a switch in the
configuration menu to disable entropy-gathering in the interrupt-routines,
have some simplistic routine (like x'=(x * m + a) % p) which returns a non-
cryptographic value, and something similar symplistic for the network-
traffic routines?
Thank you.
