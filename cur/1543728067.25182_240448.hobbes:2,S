I tried 2.6.8-rc4-mm1 on my ASUS L3800C laptop (radeon 7500), defined 
CONFIG_FB_MODE_HELPERS and I have got a hard freeze when starting X and 
framebuffer console with a lot of yellow dot on the bottom screen. 
Suddently I hear the fan meaning the machine is dead
Trying to compile without CONFIG_FB_MODE_HELPERS set do not work because
drivers/video/aty/radeon_monitor.c unconditionnaly uses "vesa_modes" 
variable that depends on CONFIG_FB_MODE_HELPERS.
Defining vesa_modes unconditionnaly as it was previously does not help : 
machine freeze. Trying the pci=routeirq (as per 2.6.8-rc3-mm2)  make the 
machine to freeze immediately without even displaying something.
Due to compilation errors in 2.6.8-rc3-mm2, I did'nt tried it. 
2.6.8-rc3-mm1 was the best kernel even on this machine.
