True, that seems to be missing.
I agree that the patch seems to consist mostly of renaming doesn't make
it any easier to read.
And it's worrying that it doesn't handle the hotplug case at all.

What experimental evidence did you have? 
But I'm tempted to drop this unless the hotplug mystery can be cleared
up. There was past information that logical is unsafe for hotplug.
