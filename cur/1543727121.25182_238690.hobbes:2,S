Hello,
I tried to compile this one, but got an error on:
drivers/pci/hotplug/cpci_hotplug_core.c : unknown field `generic_disable_irq' 
specified in initializer
I disabled hotplug in the config file and the compilation succeeded without 
problems ;-) (I don't need hotplug, but maybe others do)
Thanks for all the work done, I'm gonna test it now :-)
