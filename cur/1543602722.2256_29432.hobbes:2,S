I've applied this patch, and together with 2.4.9-ac16 on
my UltraSparc (1x300mHz, 1024Mb)  seems to be working just fine
so far.
I've got a pretty popular Unreal Tournament Map Mirror site,
so my webserver gets a lot of traffic which should exercise the VM
pretty well, especially as I keep quite a few xterms open.  Plus
a mozilla build every now and then.
But up to now it looks good!  Nice job, all.
