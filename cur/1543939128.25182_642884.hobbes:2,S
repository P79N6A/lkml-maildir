Yes, and it simplifies Xen as it always starts guest domains in the 
appropriate pagetable mode and doesn't let the guest change it on the 
fly.  If early_ioremap depends on non-PAE early pagetables in an 
otherwise PAE kernel, we'd need to go to some effort to make sure all 
the early_ioremap stuff is skipped (which would be possible but 
unpleasant for domU, but very bad in dom0).
