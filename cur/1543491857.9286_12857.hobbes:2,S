This is an older Tyan Tomcat S1562 Dual socket-7 and it just MIGHT be
something with this board.  I can not get the thing to work at all. Just
got the version 90q driver and tried it with both 2.2.5 and
2.0.37-pre<something> and they both act the same.
I have tried both as a module, compiled in the kernel, in every different
slot on the PCI bus, etc.  I DID get it to work ONCE with 2.0.36 and the
supplied driver but that was only after I took the interface down and
brought it back up ... it just came up that one time. I have not been able
to duplicate it. Note that this is an SMP box with dual P150's. I have not
tried it on a UP kernel on this box.
