Latest 2.2.14pre2 kernel will not compile. 2.2.13 compiled fine under
the same config, but when I compile 2.2.14pre2 (after doing everything
possible to prevent it, make mrproper, cleaning out old configs, etc.
still does it) It stops at ipforward.c with the following message
(perhaps IP masq tweak wasn't completely backed out?):
---
ip_forward.c: In function `ip_forward':
ip_forward.c:179: `maddr' undeclared (first use in this function)
ip_forward.c:179: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
ip_forward.c:179: for each function it appears in.)
make[3]: *** [ip_forward.o] Error 1
make[3]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux/net/ipv4'
---
Having pretty minimal C knowledge, I couldn't find anything obvious
that's wrong in the sourcecode.
