Oh, well sure.  Now that somebody's asking, I can't reproduce it.
But here's some snippets from /var/log/messages from Tuesday:
Mar 23 16:17:26 slc-sunny kernel: tr0: ISA P&P Auto 16/4 Adapter found

And this is pretty much it until I either reboot or down the adapter 
interface.
But I recompiled last night and today I seem to be stable... huh.

Can you tell me a little about how your adapter is configured?  The
tr0 messages from syslog would be fine for a start.
