Here are some notes that I forgot to include in the mail:
The three patches:
        [PATCH 3/6] readahead: kconfig option READAHEAD_ALLOW_OVERHEADS
        [PATCH 4/6] readahead: kconfig option READAHEAD_SMOOTH_AGING
        [PATCH 5/6] readahead: kconfig option READAHEAD_HIT_FEEDBACK
make the menuconfig look like this:
        [*] Adaptive file readahead (EXPERIMENTAL)
        [*]   Allow extra features with overheads
        [*]     Readahead debug and accounting (NEW)
        [*]     Readahead hit feedback (NEW)
        [ ]     Fine grained readahead aging (NEW)
With all of the three new options disabled(the defaults), it becomes comparable
to the stock readahead in efficiency when reading big files:
