I would argue that 2.2 wasn't really usable until somewhere around 2.2.12.
I would also claim that 2.4 wasn't useful until 2.4.10.
If we continue to improve along these lines, can I expect 2.6 to be 
generally usable somewhere around 2.6.8? :)

His experiences pretty much mirror my own -- ACPI has been an adventure, 
cpufreq occasionally didn't work, full USB doesn't work without ACPI, I 
need alsa drivers and ACPI in order to have acceptable sound, and I need 
to use GATOS drivers for my display, else 3d just blows chunks.
For the longest time on this beast, kernel upgrades were a day long 
adventure. 
First, to push in acpi, cpufreq, and freeswan. (Oh, look, 2.4.foo is 
out ... but the latest ACPI patch was 2.4.foo-prebar and CPUfreq is 
2.4.foo-pre(bar-2)-3weeks-earlier ... time to patch and resolve 
rejections!)
Then it was off to put in alsa, radoen, freeswan, linux-wlan-ng and so 
forth ...
Some things should be migrated in and updated. drm modules, for example. I 
would also vote for alsa being merged. ACPI was brought up to date in 
2.4.22, I believe, but I haven't checked since then. It should also be 
relativelt current, IMHO.

I have to agree with both of these points. 2.6.0 will probably have 
problems that will take a while to sort out. Putting it on systems to test 
is one thing, putting it into production as its the only blessed solution 
is another ...
