Most I/O devices will do DMA to the page in question and thus the kernel
hasn't written to it and the CPU won't have the data in cache.  For the
few devices which can't do DMA, it's the responsibility of the device
driver to call flush_dcache_page() (or some other flushing primitive).
See the gdth driver for an example:
            address = kmap_atomic(sg_page(sl), KM_BIO_SRC_IRQ) + sl->offset;
            memcpy(address, buffer, cpnow);
            flush_dcache_page(sg_page(sl));
            kunmap_atomic(address, KM_BIO_SRC_IRQ);
