Hi John,
Thanks for the suggestion, but I've been running my tests with that
turned off.  Actually, I've turned off pretty much all debugging, and
added my own logdev device.  As mentioned in my previous email, that I
CC you on, I found the culprit.
Seems, the SLOB is not as fast as the SLAB. I'll look more into this
tomorrow. (My wife is taking by daughter out of town for gymnastics, so
I get to stay home and work :-/ )
