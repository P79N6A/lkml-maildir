oops.  I guess most architectures set cpu_present_map while bringing up the
APs.
I think it'd be cleanest to require that the arch do that -
fixup_cpu_present_map() looks like a bit of a hack.
I guess if we want to perpetuate fixup_cpu_present_map() then we should
teach it to ignore the boot cpu.   (cpus_weight(&cpu_present_map) == 1)
would do that.
