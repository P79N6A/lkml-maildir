POSIX states "the choice of threads is left entirely up to the 
implementation .. to give implementations the freedom to deliver
the signal to the "easiest possible"  ... "
Delivery of pended signals is another thing that can be solved by the root
thread daemon.
The original signal is delivered to the root thread. This thread determines
that nobody wants it, and marks it pending. We've fixed libc so that
the real threads that change their masks must go via a user space routine
that simulates the signal all in user space when it gets unblocked.
(POSIX seems to always provide some wriggle room to do the right thing
 or at least force the costs to be paid by the offending program).

POSIX is not vague. It is quite clear that implementations may core
dump programs that try this.

lock_signals = 1; // all signal functions in my code check this
                 // and do the appropriate thing.
