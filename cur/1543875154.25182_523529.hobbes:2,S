Here is the test code that I used:
(warning: x86 centric)
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#define SIZE	(4*1024*1024UL)
int main(void)
{
	int fd;
	long i;
	char *addr;
	fd = open("/dev/hugetlb", O_RDWR);
	if (fd == -1) {
		perror("open failure");
		exit(1);
	}
	addr = mmap(0, SIZE, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);
	if (addr == MAP_FAILED) {
		perror("mmap failure");
		exit(2);
	}
	for (i = 0; i < SIZE; i+=4096)
		addr[i] = 1;
	printf("success!\n");
}
