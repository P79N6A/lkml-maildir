I looked into writing a decoder. It's really helpful to have a
fixed ratio of high/low states. It's also good to avoid silence.
The melody is important, so the user will know how long to
record, and to provide a way to sync up the decoder.
AMTOR w/ FEC is looking pretty good, but it needs the
character set fixed. (new shift states, 1 ASCII per 2 Baudot,
or a new code table) I hear there are extensions available
that would at least do lowercase and a bit more puctuation.
Not being a DSP expert, I'm using an FFT to get the power
spectrum for a small region. I slide this window along the
audio sample. I have pretty pictures of the bits now. :-)
It looks like I could pick a frequency with a wide range
of thresholds that give me the proper mark:space ratio,
then recover the clocking... It's not too hard I think, even
after going *.wav --> *.ogg --> *.au or misinterpreting the
data type.
So this is 100 baud. Guessing at good frequencies:
1940 HZ and 1500 HZ
1600 HZ and 1140 HZ
(wide separation needed because I'm not a DSP expert)
