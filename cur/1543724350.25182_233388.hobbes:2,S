i've fixed latencies in ext3, i'm not sure how bad XFS is. But 2-3
seconds delay is almost impossible to be a true scheduling latency -
it's probably IO latency impacting your audio application. (it could
also be normal preemption latency, if those tasks are not running as
SCHED_FIFO - but 2-3 seconds preemption latency should not be caused by
a simple cp -a. This leaves IO latency.).
