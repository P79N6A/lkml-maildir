Would be happy if it were the sensors but i am not using them, a least 
not the ones lm-sensors can use. My temperature is shown via ACPI 
Thermal zone of the processor driver. Afaik ACPI does also regulate the 
fan-speed so it doesn't work proper without acpi-processor driver as 
mentionend in the first post. so i don't think that the different 
sensors in i2c have to do something with it. But thanks for response, 
good to know that others have similar problems, even if they are not the 
same ;) Anyone else an idea how to tell acpi that it has perhaps wrong 
values?. I remember that when i first used this laptop with linux the 
fan went off after some time but now the fan doesn't go off, at least i 
don't recognize it. this is just because acpi has too high temps and 
lets the fan cool down the cpu because of that (at least acpi thinks so 
;)). Thanks for every help
