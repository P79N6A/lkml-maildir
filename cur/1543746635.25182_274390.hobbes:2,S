Recursion is like that (... like recursion, that is :-).

Both md and dm call generic_make_request rather than submit_bio to
start IO on slaves, so it wouldn't work in submit_bio.  If dm and md
were changes to use submit_bio, then the counts (page-in, page-out)
would be quite different...

It is my understanding the bi_next is free.  It is available for use
by ->make_request_fn and below. __make_request uses it for chaining
bio's together  into a request.  raid5 uses it for other things.
If a ->make_request_fn did synchronous IO things would definitely get
unstuck.   But I don't think they should and doubt if they do (md
certainly doesn't).
