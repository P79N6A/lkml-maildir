Nothing in the manuals says that write() on same fd should be non racy : In 
particular file pos might be undefined. There is a reason pwrite() exists.
Kernel doesnt have to enforce thread safety as standard is quite clear.
Only O_APPEND case is specially handled (and NFS might fail to handle this 
case correctly)
