/me keeping to the bad habit of following up to myself
Regarding the current 2.6.8 kernel, wouldn't it be a better idea to
move the CAP_SYS_RAWIO check to open time instead of when the ioctl is
called?  This would require a new flag somewhere in the file structure
I suppose, e.g. file->f_mode & FMODE_RAWIO.  
That would allow a suid root application to open the cdrom and then
drop all capabilities including RAWIO and would probably fit better
into how cdrecord expects things to work.
