I recently reinstalled my laptop (Fujitsu P2110) with RHEL4, and I
found that neither ACPI S3 or APM suspend (booting with acpi=off) work
reliably with their stock kernel (a 2.6.9 derivative).  Sometimes
resuming works, but more often the computer locks up, or the keyboard
doesn't function respond.
APM suspend worked fine on the last kernel I tried it with (stock
2.6.3) but I think the last time I tried a newer vanilla kernel
(around 2.6.9 time), it didn't work.  I don't think I've ever seen
Linux ACPI S3 suspend work reliably on this laptop, but since APM was
always so solid I didn't test it much.
Have there been any improvements in this area in more recent Linus
kernels?  Any patches floating around which fix suspend-to-ram
problems?
Thanks,
Ian
