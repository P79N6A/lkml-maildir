I think that it's what I want (i.e. the implementation is what I would 
have done) but I'm confused by you reference to inheritance.  My concern 
is to NOT inherit the data (via the notifier_block) but to have separate 
data for each task which is why I was concerned about not finding where 
"notify" was being initialized on boot.
What I'm doing is using an ordinary watcher to catch new tasks being 
created via WATCH_TASK_INIT and attaching a per task watcher to them at 
that time.  As per your suggestion the notifier_block for the per task 
watcher is contained in a struct which contains the data that I need to 
maintain for each task.  So two layers of watchers :-)
It will be a good test of your mechanism if I can get it to work.
It'll probably take me another couple of days to complete this code as 
I'm having to figure out how it all hangs together as I go.  I'll let 
you know when I've finished.
Peter
