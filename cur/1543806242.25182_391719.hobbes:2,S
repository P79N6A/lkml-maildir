Why should I need privs to talk to *any* SCSI device, when I want to
talk to just *one* SCSI device?
Yes, it is a missing feature in libscg. It requires priviledge to talk
to *any* device, while is only really needs to talk to *one* device.
[Imagine ls that only worked if it had priviledges for reading
/etc/shadow. That would surely be bug.]
