Subject: [2.4.18] Security: Process-Killer if machine get's out of memory

Hello all,
I've got a basic question:
Would it be possible to kill only the process which consumes the most 
memory in the last delta t?
Or does somebody have a better idea?
Background:
rsync seems to have problems when it is break off (by an error or by 
CTRL-C). After the break off, rsync eats up all the memory of the 
machine until it is killed by the kernel.
Unfortunately, the kernel didn't kill rsync at first, but too late, so 
that a lot of other, very important processes were killed before.
E.g.:

Mar 24 11:49:06 susi kernel: VM: killing process rsync
There could have been killed any other process before the evil-doer is 
removed from the memory.
Fortunately, sshd wasn't killed, so I could restart all the other 
processes again.
rsync is an actual example for the problem, I wrote. This could be any 
other process, eating up the memory. Then, the kernel kills wildly some 
processes until the right process is killed - and the machine is 
probably unavailable meanwhile.

Andreas Hartmann
