Subject: [QUESTION] "No 100Hz timer" thread - any LKML archive?

Hi,
does anybody know about any archive/digest service for this mailing
list? Majordomo at vger doesn't support this. Or does anybody of you
archive all e-mails?
I'm especially interested in the _WHOLE_ thread "No 100Hz timer !" now.
(but the question is asked in general). If you have the complete thread,
I would be very glad if you could expose it on WWW for me to download.
I've met different better or worse http interfaces to archives
(included www.mail-archive.com). But I'm not satisfied with them - no
header's, I must wget... I want to have a folder of e-mails and sort
them by threads in mutt - this is only possible when headers are
preserved.
	Thank you
		Tomas
