Subject: [PATCH] fix writing to unintended memory in eth16i_probe_port(); drivers/net/eth16i.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/6/323

14 is added as an offset to the array dummy_packet (64 unsigned chars) to
serve as a destination address in a call to memset(). However, when added, 
it is automatically scaled by the size of dummy_packet, which is 64. This
results in writing to unintended memory.
