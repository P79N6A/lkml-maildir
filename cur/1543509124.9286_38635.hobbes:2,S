However
1.	A properly tuned system doesn't run out of signal queue space, so
	the poll case almost never occurs.
2.	If it does then probably most ports have events anyway so poll
	is no more than annoying, as is checking each port
So we go very fast 99.99% of the time. I can live with 1 in 10,000 buckets
having a leak..
