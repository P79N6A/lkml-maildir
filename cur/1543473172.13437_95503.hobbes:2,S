It does come to something when the freshmeat announce arrives before you
announce the patch ;)
This is 2.1.132ac2. The 8390 might work now, or it might not work at all.
It has the fix from Linus for the enable_irq bug.

PS Anyone with a PS/2 whose internal scsi stopped working about 2.1.131
please drop me a note. I've "fixed" the PS/2 77 case but would like to
find out if it fixes any other problems.

	Now its metalab not sunsite.unc.edu
	Been a long time gone sunsite.unc.edu
	Now its a generally bright not a special sun site
	Every file in sunsite.unc.edu
	Lives in metalab not sunsite.unc.edu
	So if you've got a url for sunsite.unc.edu
	It'll be archived for you in metalab
	....
