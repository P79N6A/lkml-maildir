This may be a function of the operating system or the filesystem, but
it isn't necessarilly an artifact of the drives themselves.  With both
read and write caching enabled, random writes will always be faster
than random reads from the drive perspective.
Even with queueing enabled (legacy TCQ or Native-SATA "NCQ"), your
ability to reorder reads is limited in ATA to 32 tags, while the
ability to reorder cached writes is limited only by buffer size and
cache granularity...  the absolute worst-case write performance should
be the same as read performance.
