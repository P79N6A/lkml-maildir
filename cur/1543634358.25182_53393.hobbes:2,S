I traced the change to the part of mainline ChangeSet 1.496 given
below (warning: cut and pasted).  It seems to cause every possible
device that a driver could provide to show up in /proc/partitions.
For LVM, that's a zillion devices, and /proc/partitions overflows,
showing some random pages from memory.  Reverting the patch below
makes /proc/partitions and LVM happy again.
Cheers,
Wayne
