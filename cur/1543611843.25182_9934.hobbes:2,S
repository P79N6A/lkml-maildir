I always had that problem though. Doesn't it only set kapmd-idled running
if the CPU has been idle for at least 1/3 second, though?

Mmmm, my dell insp. 4000 is now running at 53 degrees (2.4.16 - mozilla
and xemacs open) - it used to run a lot cooler, even with just 2.4.13-ac4.
This is with me doing absolutely nothing.
And integrated over the uptime of the laptop, kapmd-idled seems to only be
using about 30% CPU compared to the old 50% (and 90% with an old kernel -
but that could have been that bug detected a while back)
Of course, I just remembered we have just entered summer, and this room is
damn hot - but I wouldn't expect a laptop getting so hot it needs to turn
the fan on, when doing _nothing_!
