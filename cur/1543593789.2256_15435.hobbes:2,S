Struct padding is a problem. Really, there shouldn't be any
implicit padding. This causes:
1. security leaks when such structs are copied to userspace
   (the implicit padding is uninitialized, and so may contain
   a chunk of somebody's private key or password)
2. bloat, when struct members could be reordered to eliminate
   the need for padding
