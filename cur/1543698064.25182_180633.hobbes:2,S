Another data point about this, still unsolved problem:
The number of times I can do an 'su amanda' then exit, and redo the it 
seem to be somewhat random,  One test I managed to get to the 4th su 
before it hung.  I turned on the linux normal security stuff in the 
.config, rebuilt and rebooted.  It had been off previously because 
this machine is behind a firewall.
That time I only got one free ride, it hung on the next attempt.  So I 
left it hung, and put the ksysguard highlight line on the hung su 
process, then put ksysguard into the tree mode.  The last item in the 
branch was an 'stty', which was reported to be 'stopped'.  I killed 
it.  I got my prompt back, as the user amanda, confirmed by a whoami.
Another data point that might be a clue is that there appears to be no 
such restriction if the 'su amanda -c "command"' syntax is used.  The 
only place that hangs is if I try to do an amcheck after refilling 
the tape robots magazine, under 2.4.22 ti will load the last tape 
slot and resume the search thru the magazine for the right tape.  
Under 2.60-test-whatever, I'm getting a signal 11 from the chg-scsi 
script after a long delay, but it does load from the last loaded 
tapeslot in the magazine.  If I simply up-arrow and repeat, it works 
as the first pass did load the tape just fine.
I think these are really two seperate problems.
