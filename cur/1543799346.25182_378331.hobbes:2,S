I don't have access to the real source now, but if the prio
type is an int, we maybe should change that to 'INT_MIN(highest)
to INT_MAX(lowest)', or make the prio an unsigned and range it 
0 to UINT_MAX.

This comment about K is kind of misleading; if I use the plist for 
things other than scheduling chores, K changes. I'd cite that as an
example, something like:
  ...K is the number of priority levels used. For example, when
  using this list type for real-time task queuing, 1 <= K <= 99.
