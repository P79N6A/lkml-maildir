Since Pentium 4 and Xeon share the same core, you see the HT bit on Pentium
4 as well. The HT bit does not mean HT is enabled (you can enable/disable
usually by the BIOS setup), but the number of the threads (i.e. logical
CPUs) in a processor package must be 2 (via cpuid instruction) so that the
OS can be sure that HT is enabled (see setup.c). The HT bit is just useful
as a prerequisite for HT.
Thanks,
Jun

If this is correct, and there is not destop P4 capable of ht,
then what does mean the ht flag in cpuinfo?
