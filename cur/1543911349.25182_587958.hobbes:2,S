Hi Andrew,
well, whenever it comes to address space layout randomization, there 
usually follows a huge debate whether it is needed or not, some people 
think it's useful and powerful security protection against 0day attacks, 
other people think that it's just fighting the bugs in userspace software 
in a wrong way.
Opinions differ, that's why there is a way to turn the VA space 
randomization completely off trivially.
We already have randomized stack, randomized mmap base, randomized vdso 
page in mainline kernel, but code and heap still stay on deterministic 
addresses. I think providing the possibility for users to have really full 
address space randomization (if they want to) is much better than 
providing the current slightly crippled state, when some parts of address 
space are randomized and some are not. Or do you think we should rather 
rip all the randomization off?
And it's almost certain to me that users want this functionality - look 
major distros. They seem to have out-of-tree patches to provide this 
functionality to their users, IMHO.
Thanks,
