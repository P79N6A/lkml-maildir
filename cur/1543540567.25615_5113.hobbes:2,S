Hi,
I've posted a patch here to compile Athlon+SMP. A search
should find it easily.
It works around header problems from in_interrupt() in
asm/string.h by moving *_memcpy3d() to arch/i386/lib/mmx.c
and declaring them 'extern inline' in asm/mmx.h.
The resulting SMP kernel runs fine on a UP machine. Untested
on the genuine thing.
I want one too.
Tom
