Hello, and thanks to all for continued support and developement of the Linux
kernel.  :)
APPLICATION: This applies to all kernels, all distributions, and all
architectures...
DESRIPTION: "make menuconfig"  GUI issue
SETUP: When I run "make menuconfig" and I am in the process of
enabling/disabling options, I have a "bad habit?" (that I'm sure is more
like an epidemic) of placing one finger on the "Esc" key, one finger on the
"Space" key, and another on the "Enter" key as I manuver through the various
selections.
PROBLEM: (ocassionally) While I am speeding through the kernel
configuration, I will accidentally hit the "Esc" key one too many times (I'm
sure we've all done this) and it will leave me at the "exit" screen:
                        Do you wish to save your new kernel config?
                                           <Yes>     <No>
In this case, neither choice is acceptable. In a plea to save time for all,
can someone please add one more simple choice to the "exit" menu?
                        Do you wish to save your new kernel config?
                             <Yes>     <No>     <Return to Config>
Thanks for your time, and thanks once again for all who continually work
towards the advancement of Linux.
Regards,
Steve Hampton
