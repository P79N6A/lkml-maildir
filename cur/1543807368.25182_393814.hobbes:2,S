I guess that big issue here is that the pgrotate logic is completly
useless for common cases (and no one stepped up to fix it, here's a
chance).
You had to modify the default dirty limits to watch writeout happen via
the VM reclaim path. Usually most writeout happens via pdflush and the
dirty limits at the write() path.
Surely the question you raise about why writeback ends before the
shrinker adds such pages back to LRU is important, but getting pgrotate
to _work at all_ for common scenarios is broader and more crucial.
Marking PG_writeback pages as PG_rotated once they're chosen candidates
for eviction increases the number of rotated pages dramatically, but
that does not necessarily increase performance (I was unable to see any
performance increase under the limited testing I've done, even though
the pgrotated numbers were _way_ higher).
Another issue is that increasing the number of rotated pages increases
lru_lock contention, which might not be an advantage for certain
workloads.
So, any change in this area needs careful study under a varied,
meaningful set of workloads and configurations (which has not been
happening very often).
