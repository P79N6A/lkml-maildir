Yes! I meant we should change INIT_SIGNALS(), currently it does
	#define INIT_SIGNALS(sig) {
		...
		.pgrp           = 1,
		{ .__session      = 1},
and this confuses (I think) set_special_pids(1,1) above. Because
__set_special_pids() still deals with pid_t, not "struct pid".
Unless I missed something, we should kill these 2 initializations
above.
