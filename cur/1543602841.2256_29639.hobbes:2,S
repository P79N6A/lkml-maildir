Hmm.
Ok, can someone tell me how many different ages there can be in the VM?  
I'm thinkin of a tool (vm-page-stat?) that will list the percentage of pages
at a specific (or if there are more than ~10 page ages possible, it could
use ranges...) age much like vmstat does now.
Is there any possibility of using Russell's patch for this user space tool?
Maybe Russel's patch could have a proc interface that vm-page-stat would
read to get a snapshot?
It would certainly be more helpful than vmstat alone...
