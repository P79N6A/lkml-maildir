Hello,
This is done under LinuxPPC5 on a PowerMac.
trying to apply the 2.2.13pre567 patches to the stock 2.2.12, the linker
told me this:
fs/fs.o: In function `copy_strings':
fs/fs.o(.text+0x88d8): undefined reference to `strnlen_user'
fs/fs.o(.text+0x88d8): relocation truncated to fit: R_PPC_REL24 strnlen_user
fs/fs.o: In function `create_elf_tables':
fs/fs.o(.text+0x13450): undefined reference to `strnlen_user'
fs/fs.o(.text+0x13450): relocation truncated to fit: R_PPC_REL24 strnlen_user
fs/fs.o(.text+0x134a4): undefined reference to `strnlen_user'
fs/fs.o(.text+0x134a4): relocation truncated to fit: R_PPC_REL24 strnlen_user
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
A little exploration showed me, that in alpha, i386 and sparc some
updates concerning the strnlen_user were done. 
Is the PPC part already done? I got some problems when I saw the
assembly code. For me it will be heavy to fix, since I don't understand
assembly language. (and it won't be copy paste from one arch to the
other :-))
Thanks for your help
Andreas
