According to spec, maybe, but in practice not necessary. Modern gigE cards
will run just fine over all sorts of pin-outs (even non-crossed over cables)
See 
http://www.intel.com/network/connectivity/products/pro1000mt_desktop_adapter.htm
"automatically compensates for cable issues such as crossover cable, wrong
pin-out and polarity"
Or
http://www.intel.com/design/network/products/lan/controllers/82546.htm
"PHY detects polarity, MDI-X, 2 pair vs. 4 pair cables, and cable length
... No need to know the difference between crossover and non-crossover cables"
