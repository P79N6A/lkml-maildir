Hello All,
This is regarding query on AF_ROUTE sockets on Linux.
I would like to know whether Linux supports AF_ROUTE
sockets or one should use NETLINK sockets or does linux
support both. 
( In the file linux/socket.h there is comment saying
#define AF_ROUTE  AF_NETLINK  /* Alias to emulate 4.4 BSD */ )
Thanks,
Rajesh.
