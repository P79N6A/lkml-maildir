I saw the same message when running this c++ programm.
int main (int argc, char * argv[]) {
char * test;
while (1)
test=new char[1024];
}
My dmesg:
__alloc_pages: 0-order allocation failed (gfp=0x1d2/0) from c01219e7
VM: killing process a.out
I have 512 MB RAM and no swap.
Actually the system slowed down a lot but worked fine again after the kill.
And a flood ping from another PC had no lost packages.
