I'm using the one that came with the board, flat 80 wire. It
works under extreme stress in Windows 2000. It doesnt work
in Linux.
(I generated millions of interrupts from IDE and network
(dual gigabit) in Windows 2000 on this very hardware for
3 days - thats why I came to the LKML, I did an empirical
test that indicated Linux, and did some reading and others
have had similar problems.)
