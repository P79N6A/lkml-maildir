2.4.x uses the stack(s) differently than 2.6.x so it will usually be
harder (but not impossible) to break and less easy to detect.
I believe what Arjan is saying that that 2.4.x effectively really only
has 4K of safely usable stack anyhow (we have some on-stack allocated
data and interrupts use the same stack).
Also, FWIW I do think there were been reports of problems in 2.4.x
that looked like they might be stack-size related (things dying
horribly after an interrupt for example).
