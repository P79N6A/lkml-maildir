Hi!
Is there a way to prevent VT switching for XFree86 ?
I have two gfx cards and want to start an X server on the secondary
card, while leaving the VTs on the primary card active.
So I need XFree86 not to allocate and cause a switch to a new VT.
Since I know of no way to make XFree86 do that, I wonder if I can
give XFree86 some fake vt on its command line, like :
X :0 vt_dummy
Is this possible with a 2.6.x series kernel ?
Any other way to prevent X taking away "focus" from the primary card ?
( please ignore any possible issues with the keyboard, that may arise
when having X and text VT active at the same time )
Regards,
David Balazic
