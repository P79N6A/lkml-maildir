Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here are some USB fixes against 2.6.21-rc6.
They fix a reported regression with the ehci driver, and allow a new
device to work properly with the usb-storage driver.
The usb-storage patch has been in the -mm releases.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb-2.6.git/
The full patches will be sent to the linux-usb-devel mailing list, if
anyone wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
