Because I care more about the 4 bytes of extra source than the
4 bytes of extra object. 
I consider the 4 bytes of extra object code a compiler bug, and if we
start catering for that, the bug in the compiler will never be fixed.
This is similar to how Linus forced the recognition of the
"unroll-loops" bug by the gcc team.
