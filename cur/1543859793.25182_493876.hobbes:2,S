The vmsplice is basically vm intensive, so it could matter.

I don't, Intel posted a set of patches a few months ago though. I didn't
have time to look that at the time being, but you should be able to find
them in the archives.

Yes.
I added a simple splice-fromnet example in the splice git repo, see if
you can repeat your results with that. Doing:
# ./splice-fromnet -g 2001 | ./splice-out -m /dev/null
and
# cat /dev/zero | netcat localhost 2001
gets me about 490MiB/sec, using a recv/write loop is around 413MiB/sec.
Not migrating pages gets me around 422MiB/sec.
