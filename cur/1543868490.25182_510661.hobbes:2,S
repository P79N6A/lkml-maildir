I think something else is going on here.  I think you're getting
an interrupt for the UART, and another interrupt is also pending.
When the UART interrupt is handled, it is masked at the interrupt
controller, and the CPU mask is dropped.
The second interrupt comes in, and when you go to disable that
source, you inadvertently re-enable the UART interrupt, despite it
still being serviced.
This leads to the UART interrupt again triggering an IRQ.
Please show your interrupt controller (mask, unmask, mask_ack)
handling functions corresponding with the interrupt which your
UART is connected to.

This shows that you don't actually have an understanding of the Linux
kernel boot, especially in respect of serial devices.  At boot, devices
are detected and initialised to a safe state, where they will not
spuriously generate interrupts.
When a userspace program opens a serial port, which can only happen
once the kernel boot has completed (ergo, devices have been initialised
and placed in a safe state) the interrupts are claimed, and enabled
at the source.

Yes, uart states are indeterminent at this point.  However, as soon as
the 8250 driver loads it takes control of the 8250 ports, and DISABLES
the interrupt on ALL ports found, LONG BEFORE any service handlers are
installed.
So, by the time the system is up and running _all_ 8250 ports have
had their IERs written with zero.  Interrupts disabled at source.
By the time you get to open any serial port, the initialisation has
completed.

Can you add any other useless complex words into that sentence?

That is being done already at initialisation time.
Now, please show your interrupt mask/unmask/mask_ack code, which is
where I believe your problem to lie.
