Ouch, PCI really should use new driver model. I have not known about
that. I'll look into it.

IIRC, I had SAVE_STATE there at some point, and there was some
problem. I do not really use APM :-(.

Good. I figured vetoing support is not critical. I should add it.

Yes, agreed.

Do you need vetoing? Otherwise it should be ready, except for APM.
