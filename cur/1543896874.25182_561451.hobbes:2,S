Perhaps the API can be slimmed down in the process, because half
of the tasklet interface functions are hardly used at all.

18 users of this macro. Maybe too much for the start, but if we convert
all of them to use either tasklet_init or use work queues directly,
the macro can go away.

this one is easier, there are only four users in total: three input
drivers, and tipc.

there are 34 files using tasklet_hi_* functions. In theory, these
could be converted to the non-hi version with a simple search and
replace, if it's clear that there is not much point in keeping them.
The most common use of tasklet_hi is in the alsa drivers. If it
actually makes a difference for them already, maybe there should
be an alsa softirq instead of moving them all over to work queues.

only has two users, bcm43xx and sc92031. If both are
converted to workqueue, the interface removed can be
removed.
> +extern void tasklet_kill_immediate(struct tasklet_struct *t, unsigned int cpu);
only one user in total, rcupdate.c. You already take care of that,
it seems the declaration is just a leftover.
