Changes since 2.6.24-rc7-rt1
  - Several merge fixes reported by:
	Mariusz Kozloski
  - Removal of kvm-rt.patch (it's so old it is now bogus)
  - PPC compile fix (reported by: Robert Schwebel)
  - Remove of running softirq by hardirq (too dangerous)
  - Changed BUG_ON in filemap from atomic to pagefault disabled
       (Steven Rostedt)
Note: There are still some fixes that are not incorporated here yet.
