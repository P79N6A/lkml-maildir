I'm sorry,  I'm completely lost.  You mention an oops, but I don't
see one in the transcript you posted.
You originally mentioned a hang while alsa was starting up.  But
the transcript you posted doesn't show a hang.  Does it work when
the drivers are builtin, but hang when they are modules?
lspci shows some sort of ISDN card, but I don't see a driver for
it.  Are you using that?
