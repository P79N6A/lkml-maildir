	monotonic_clock as proposed uses a hardware clock.
Specifically, the TSC on vanilla intel, the Cyclone timer on x440, and
associated clocks on S/390 (to speak of platforms I've visited
recently).  Right now, the hangcheck-timer accesses the hardware counter
directly.  monotonic_clock is intended as a portable and consistent
accessor instead.
	The current gettimeofday() corrects for ~1s.  Even if we found a
way to correct for ~1000s or more, there would still be a race between
when the caller reads and when the correction happens.  A clock that
reads a hardware counter doesn't have this problem.
	If code doesn't need this accuracy, it can just use
gettimeofday().
