The first crash was with gcc 4.1.1, but now I recompiled the kernel
with "gcc version 3.2.3 20030502 (Red Hat Linux 3.2.3-56.fc5)" and I
can still reproduce the same crash. The backtrace looks the same,
although the addresses are obviously different. Some hand copied data
from the oops:
BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 1d075089
