Yes. 
However, I think the _real_ bug is that we have reiserfs near the tail of 
filesystems to try.
The filesystems in fs/Makefile are listed in order of being probed, so I 
really thing the real fix is to ignore the whole verbose thing entirely,
and just move reiserfs upwards.
Because if you actually get far enough that you try to mount UFS as your
root filesystem, you have other problems, and verbosity at boot is not
your real issue.
Can you test that alternate patch instead?
