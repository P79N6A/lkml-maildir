not good. newer chips (eg 1520) have a default value != 0. when a manufacter
forgets the serial ROM and does nothing in the BIOS you end up with default
values (eg. the 1520 has all serial interrupts). for the 1410 irqmux defaults to 0.

currently yes, i try to do better in the next version.

not broken hardware. uninitialized hardware. hardware that doesn't work with
yenta_socket but works with some redmond os...bad...

it's a 1410. and it's working. almost. with the redmond os it works, with linux
it works too and with freebsd the laptop dies as soon as inserting a card.
it's programmed for serial interrputs and PCI, INTA is routed. so not really
a problem there. (and my patch does _nothing_ there :)

good catch...ti113x is one w/o irqmux...so yes ti12xx_override is the right place.
another bug in the disabled code...and i think in 2.4 too)

of course a module param would suck. that's why i didn't write code.
there's another bug btw. one that is probably never hit and harmless too:
rmk's notbook has parellel isa interrupts, INTA is _not_ routed. if it happens
that all the interrupts are taken by other devices the resource manager falls
back to routing the card to PCI which we know is not working...however
it is not happening on a notebook.
