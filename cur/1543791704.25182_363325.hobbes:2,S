NFORCE2 on an ACPI-enabled kernel should automatically invoke
the acpi_skip_timer_override BIOS workaround -- as
the NFORCE family of chip-sets have the timer interrupt
attached to pin-0, but some of them shipped with
a bogus BIOS over-ride telling Linux the timer is on pin-2.
This issue is quite old -- google NFORCE2 and acpi_skip_timer_override.
IIR there are whole web-sites with NFORCE2
workarounds provided by its dedicated fans...
