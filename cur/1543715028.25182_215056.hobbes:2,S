 I was about to say the problem doesn't appear like that (it just takes
an age to cycle through all 4 boxes), but I thought I'd better try it -
guess what, the alt key is no longer functioning on the duron/2.6.5 box
when I go to it like that.  I've now gone back to it using key presses
and it sorted itself out after I threw in an extra press of the scroll
lock (the xterm was responding, unlike console sessions, it was only the
alt key that seemed to be swallowed).  At least I've now found out a way
to fix the immediate "loss of alt key" problem - thanks !

 Interesting idea, but I've got enough trouble with userspace apps
without hacking the kernel, and anyway /some/ of the scroll-lock
keypresses are needed to get directly to the desired session.
