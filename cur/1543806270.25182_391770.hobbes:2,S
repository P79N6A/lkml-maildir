We need to root cause this before that decision is made.

Actually I remember something very weird with this error.
I think the Non-Fatal was some weird designation by Intel,
that came right out of the data sheet but didn't have a useful
interpretation.
I suspect that you have an actual hardware problem there.
Quite possibly that a riser or card is not plugged in all of
the way.
As I recall most of the checks clear the error bit when they
detect the error so the fact that it is reoccurring suggests
that the error is reoccurring this frequently.
So before we go off and give up and interpreting this error
can we please root cause at least what the driver is doing?
It has been about a year since I saw something like this and
someone else was tracking the error but I seem to remember
an error message like this resulting from  an actual fixable problem.
