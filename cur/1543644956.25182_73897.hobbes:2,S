This raises a generally interesting question:  When should a driver module
be loaded?
Should it be there all the time? -- usually not.  Or only when the device
is in active use?  Also at detection (hotplug) and removal time?  As long
as the device is installed?  What if the device is built into the system
and can never be removed?  What if the device is not subject to
hotplugging itself but is required in order to operate another device that
can be hotplugged (e.g., a USB host controller driver)?
I think it's clear that the answer must depend on the particular driver,
and that no single scheme involving usage counts (or the equivalent) can
suffice for every situation.
Is there a way to let the kernel provide a variety of mechanisms and let
the device driver (or even the user) select which one gets used?
