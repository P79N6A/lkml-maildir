On-disk - yes, but we still need to allocate RAM to create the "pagedir".
It takes ca (nr_copy_pages/(PBS_PER_PAGE-1) + !!(nr_copy_pages % (PBS_PER_PAGE-1))),
so we should include this number in the check for free RAM and in the message
in swsusp_alloc(), I think.
Besides, the checks for free RAM and swap could be moved to
suspend_prepare_image(), along with the accompanying printk()s,
so that we call swsusp_alloc() only after we have verified there should
be enough resources.
Greetings,
Rafael
