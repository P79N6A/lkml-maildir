Hi Bodo,
if you are willing to put some effort into the ability to scroll the 
console after panic, it might be worthwile to look making the keyboard 
driver work even after panic (i.e. poll the keyboard, rather than relying 
on interrupts).
That has significantly smaller potential of breaking because the system is 
expected to be dead after panic (watchdogs, broken data structures in 
memory, etc).
