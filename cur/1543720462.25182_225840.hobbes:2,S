In this case, however, it has nothing directly to do with qmail.  This
is tcpserver, and tcpserver only uses getpid for two things: printing
out status lines with the PID in them (which seems perfectly valid to
me), and once when adding to random initializer for DNS requests.
This strace pattern seemed rather odd to me, so for comparison I straced
my own tcpserver setups, and could not get them to produce more than two
getpid calls per connection.  Something is wrong with this trace,
possibly some weirdness in a patch, like whatever the SSL library is
doing.
