confirm. tryed with cables about 4 inches long,
to no success. The process doing the i/o hangs and cannot be killed, so no 
proper sync or shutdown other than reset is possible.
2.6.16 release shows no improvement.
2.6.16-rc6-mm2 does not even recognise the maxtor at boot...
btw, a couple of WD drives went flawless.
