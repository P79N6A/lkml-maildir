Hi!
 Here is a new version of my vga patch. I now have it where you go from
vgacon to fbcon to vgacon again. I have tried this with the vga16fb
driver and it works very well. It needs a little work for a better
vgacon restore mode. Vgacon can even restore the fonts itself :-) 
I tested it with the matrox framebufer with less luck. I assume I'm not
freeing resources properly. I will test it with other fbdev drivers next
week. Thank you.
