Hi
I seem to have an oversight with ck in the batch implementation that may 
be causing problems that wouldn't happen if you used the standalone 
staircase patch. Can you try the standalone s7.7 patch (not from the split 
out patches in the ck directory) that is in my patches/2.6/2.6.7 
directory?
Thanks
Con
