Increasing the request queue size should help there
(/sys/block/sda/queue/nr_requests).  Maybe 25% or more benefit with that
test, at a guess.
Probably initscripts should do that rather than leaving the kernel defaults
in place.  It's a bit tricky for the kernel to do because the decision
depends upon the number of disks in the system, as well as the amount of
memory.
Or perhaps the kernel should implement a system-wide limit on the number of
requests in flight.  While avoiding per-device starvation.  Tricky.
