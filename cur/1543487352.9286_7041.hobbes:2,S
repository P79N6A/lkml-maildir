Hi again,
just swapped the two cards back, so it is the same configuration like when
this whole thing started (Same cards in the same slots). Works just fine
again.
Just remembered another thing I wanted to write earlier. When booting the
machine after the incident (just halting and pressing the reset-button),
it came up with:
eth0: Digital DC21041 Tulip at 0x8100, 21040 compatible mode, EEPROM not
present, 00 4c 69 6e 75 79, IRQ 0.
eth1: Digital DC21041 Tulip at 0x8200, 21041 mode, 00 00 f8 30 6f 4f, IRQ
17.
eth1:21041 Media information at 65, default media 0800 (Autosense).
eth1:  21041 media #0, 10baseT.
But an pciscan already resolved to the 0:0:0:0:0:ff HW-address....
After power-cycling the machine it reported this HW-address but the
correct IRQ...
Hope this helps some more, maybe it was just a glitch from whatever and we
should ignore it...
Cheers,
Guenter
