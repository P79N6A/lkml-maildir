Is this the kernel shipped with rh6.0? If so this looks like more cg6
weirdness.
In drivers/video/cgsixfb.c: cg6_putcs
do {
	i = fbc->s;
} while (i & 0x10000000);
is where it dies. There have been timing related problems in the past with
cg6s. Can you try adding
__asm__ __volatile__("nop;nop;nop;");
within the loop.
