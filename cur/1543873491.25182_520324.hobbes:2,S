Yes, not sure how I missed that fact...

For crash kernel only or for regular kexec too?

Something like this?

Allow i386 crash kernels to handle x86_64 dumps.
The specific case I am encountering is kdump under Xen with a 64 bit
hypervisor and 32 bit kernel/userspace. The dump created is a 64 bit
due to the hypervisor but the dump kernel is 32 bit in for maximum
compatibility.
It's possibly less likely to be useful in a purely native scenario but
I see no reason to disallow it.
