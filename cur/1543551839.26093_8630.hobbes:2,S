Look into linux/Documentation/Changes.
Oh, it fails to tell about the NFS stuff.
Basically, for using the NFS client, you need nothing. Just mount the
volumes.
For a NFS server, you need either userspace NFS server (aka unfsd), or the
user space for the kernelspace one (aka knfsd). For both, you also need the
RPC broker portmap running.
