Ok, I see, thanks. I just thought that this subsystem stuff will oblige 
me to use the device/driver/bus model which does not suit me.

My logic was that the lifetime of that kobject = lifetime of my module 
because I cannot remove the module because every it's user increments 
the module's refcount. So, if refcount of my module is zero then the 
kobject's refcount is zero. Why this doesn't this work?
Note, I do not object, I agree that in general you're right, I'm just 
wonering.
