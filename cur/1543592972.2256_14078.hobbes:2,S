I have to comment on this one, the Compaq cards (NC3131 and NC3134) are ~$210
and come with two ports, upgradable with another 2 port module (daughterboard)
you have a choice of 2 more 100mbit ports ($233) or 1 gigabit port ($500),
perhaps you were under the influence of drugs, or the salesperson was.
(btw, it uses the eepro100 driver, which, in my experience, is very stable.)
