OK, so here is my distillation of Larry's post.
  Basic summary: a distributed, replicated, version controlled user level file
  system with no limits on any of the file system events which may happened
  in parallel. All changes must be put correctly back together, no matter how
  much parallelism there has been.
  * Merging.
  * The graph structure.
  * Distributed rename handling. Centralized systems like Subversion don't
  have as many problems with this because you can only create one file in
  one directory entry because there is only one directory entry available.
  In distributed rename handling, there can be an infinite number of different
  files which all want to be src/foo.c. There are also many rename corner-cases.
  * Symbolic tags. This is adding a symbolic label on a revision. A distributed
  system must handle the fact that the same symbol can be put on multiple
  revisions. This is a variation of file renaming. One important thing to
  consider is that time can go forward or backward.
  * Security semantics. Where should they go? How can they be integrated
  into the system? How are hostile users handled when there is no central
  server to lock down?
  * Time semantics. A distributed system cannot depend on reported time
  being correct. It can go forward or backward at any rate.
I'd be willing to maintain this as the beginning of a feature list and
post it regularly to lkml if enough people feel it would be useful and not
annoying. The goal would be to identify the features/problems that would
need to be handled by a kernel-ready version control system.
Be well,
Zack
