If so, a simple write barrier should be sufficient. That's exactly what 
the x86 write barriers do too, ie stores to magic IO space are _not_ 
ordered wrt a normal [smp_]wmb() (or, as per how this thread started, a 
spin_unlock()) at all.
On x86, we actually have this "CONFIG_X86_OOSTORE" configuration option 
that gets enable for you select a WINCHIP device, because that allows a 
weaker memory ordering for normal memory too, and that will end up using 
an "sfence" instruction for store buffers. But it's not normally enabled.
So the eieio should be sufficient,then.
Of course, the x86 store buffers do tend to flush out stuff after a 
certain cycle-delay too, so there may be drivers that technically are 
buggy on x86, but where the store buffer in practice is small and flushes 
out quickly enough that you'll never _see_ the bug.

Well, the regular kernel ops definitely won't depend on that, since that's 
not the case anywhere else.
