I disagree about the "clearly". Firstly, the cacheline alignment is CPU 
dependent, so on some CPU's it's 32 bytes (or even 16), on others it is 
128 bytes. 
Secondly, a lot of locking is actually done inside a single thread, and
false sharing doesn't happen much - so keeping the locks dense can be
quite advantageous.
The cases where false sharing _does_ happen and are a problem should be 
for the application writer to worry about, not for the kernel to force.
So I think 8 bytes is plenty fine enough - with 16 bytes a remote 
possibility (I don't think it is needed, but it gives you som epadding for 
future expansion). And people who have arrays and find false sharing to be 
a problem can fix it themselves.
I personally don't find arrays of locks very common. It's much more common
to have arrays of data structures that _contain_ locks (eg things like
having hash tables etc with a per-hashchain lock) and then those container 
structures may want to be cacheline aligned, but the locks themselves 
should not need to be.
