What is the first thing anyone would do if they had a problem with
iptables? Turn on debugging, obviously.
1 - that explains why I have no problem, I build from source, since I'm
    always trying features in the new versions for better firewalls.
2 - it really should work, debug should find errors, not cause them.
3 - Perhaps debug could be disabled but default, so instead of needing
    NDEBUG in production, you would use -DDEBUG when you had a problem
    (and it might even work ;-).
