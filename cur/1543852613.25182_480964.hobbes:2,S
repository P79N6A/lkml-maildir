It sucks.
Can you try against 2.6.18-rc4 the patch at:
http://www.fr.zoreil.com/people/francois/misc/20061109-2.6.18-rc4-r8169-test.patch
If it does not work, apply on top of 2.6.18-rc4 the serie available at:
http://www.fr.zoreil.com/linux/kernel/2.6.x/2.6.18-rc4/r8169
plus the attached patch.

Subject: [PATCH] r8169: quirk for the 8110sb on arm platform
Inverting the write ordering of the TxDescAddr{High/Low} registers
suffices to trigger a sabbat of PCI errors which make the device
completely dysfunctional. The issue has not been reported on a
different platform.
Switching from MMIO accesses to I/O ones as done in Realtek's
own driver fixes (papers over ?) the bug as well but I am not
thrilled to see everyone pay the I/O price for an obscure bug.
This is the minimal change to handle the issue.
