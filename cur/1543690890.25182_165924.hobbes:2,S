One thing that we've done, and that others may find useful, is to allow 
processes to become immune to the oom-killer as long as they stay under 
a certain amount of memory allocated.
We added a syscall that specifies a certain number of pages of memory. 
As long as the process' memory utilization remains under that amount, 
the oom-killer will not kill it.
In our case we are on a mostly-embedded system, and have a pretty good 
idea what will be running.  This lets us engineer the critical apps to 
be immune, while still allowing memory to be freed up by killing 
non-critical applications.
