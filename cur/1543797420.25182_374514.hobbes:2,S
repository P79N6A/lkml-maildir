How about
if (platform_scsi_init)
	platform_scsi_init(&scsi_bus_type);
? This is similar to how the platform_notify callback code is handled. 
Making it per-arch isn't quite ideal, since x86 can be ACPI or APM and 
kernels need support for both. On the other hand, I can't think of any 
way that APM could do anything useful with the information, so per-arch 
may be reasonable.
