I have been searching for some documentation on how to get at
information regarding the process stack but I didn't find much and from
what I found it was not clear to me how I could use the information.
Here is what I am after.
We have some rudimentary memory tracking tools in our application and
I'd like to put some debug output in that allows me to write the name of
the routine I am in to some debug log.
My thinking is that I should be able to get a hold of the process call
stack and using the top of the stack I should have the name of the
function/method I am in. 
Any help on how to go about this would be appreciated. A pointer to any
documentation on how to get a hold of the stack, or the public API for
this is of course welcome.
Thanks,
Robert
