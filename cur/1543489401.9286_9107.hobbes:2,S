Hi all,
I had an Alpha164LX, kernal 2.0.x does not support 
large UID > 65535, so I went a head and did some
test on kernel 2.2.x
I did the following:
   $ mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt/test
   $ touch /mnt/test/test.txt
   $ chown 655350 /mnt/test/test.txt
and "ls -l" shows:
-rw-rw-r--   1 655350   root            0 Mar  9 21:26 test.txt
Then, I do:
   $ mount -o remount /dev/sdc1 /mnt/test
   $ ls -l
-rw-rw-r--   1 65526    root            0 Mar  9 21:26 test
See, as long as I did not remount the harddrive, the
UID will be correct.
Is this the kernel or fs-tools problem?
Regards,
Tom
