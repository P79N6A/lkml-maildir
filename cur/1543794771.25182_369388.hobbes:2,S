I figured you might have access to the official allocations from the PCI
SIG.

The SDHC standard itself is a well guarded secret. We're basing this
work on the little information that is out there and reverse engineering
the Windows driver. The PCI registers are described in a spec. by Texas
Instruments though:

They only use three bits for each field (since their controller only has
three slots), but the Windows driver reads four so that is what I've put
in the patch.
