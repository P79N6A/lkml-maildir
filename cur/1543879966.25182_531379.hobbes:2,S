Although I appreciate the heroics, you needn't do this on our account; 
the win of a couple thousand cycles is not worth the cost in complexity, 
IMHO, and the penalty on native quite potentially overshadows this.  If 
you still issue the flush inside the spinlock, as required for this 
paravirt optimization, you are taking the risk of holding the spinlock 
an extra long time while issuing a TLB shootdown - which means waiting 
for an IPI.
It might not matter that much on i386, but on big iron (or realtime) 
systems, this could have significant negative scaling effects for 
workloads where the page page table was hot on some set of CPUs (say, 
remapping file pages for database access).  In time, the benefits of 
this optimization to the hypervisor will decrease, while the benefits of 
optimizing the other way for shorter spinlock time may increase, both in 
a VM and on native hardware.
So I would rather just drop the pte_update_defer down to a pte_update if 
the flush is not immediately following - as it is nice and simply 
correct without getting in the way.  I see there is more in this thread 
that I haven't read yet, so I preemptively reserve the right to issue an 
invalidation of this opinion...
Thanks,
Zach
