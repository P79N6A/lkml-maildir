I don't suppose your network people would be willing to change it thusly:
wired ports:  gateway 192.168.0.1, netmask 255.255.255.128.0
wireless:     gateway 192.168.128.1, netmask 255.255.255.128.0
Or move the wireless up to 192.168.1.1 if they think that would confuse things
too much.
There's a limit to how far we should bend over backwards to support stupid
networking decisions. 192.168 *is* a /16, might as well use it. ;)
If they won't, you're pretty much stuck with binding applications to one
interface or another.
