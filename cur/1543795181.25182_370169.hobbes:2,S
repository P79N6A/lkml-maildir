Hi!
> (5) a pony
Be carefull what you ask for. Pony is rather easy to get (not as easy
as a small cat, but...) and requires quite a lot of maintanence. Ouch
and it eats lots of energy even in sleep mode, and you'd better keep it
far away from computers.

Thats easy to do, too. Unfortunately it would probably mean "lets go
back to bacterias"
