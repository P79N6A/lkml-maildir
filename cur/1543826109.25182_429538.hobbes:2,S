So my question is this: what keeps the superblock of the filesystem
on the server from going away when unmounted (assuming it was the last
instance). I have been unable to locate in the code where any reference
counts pertaining to the superblock are incremented as a result of
opening a file.
Obviously however, something must keep the superblock from going away or
the final read would fail.  Even if by some means the inode was preserved
across mounts the field inode->i_sb would become invalid if the original
SB was destroyed.
