Yes.  I posted it to lkml, and the virtualization list, on the 30th of April.
I thought you had seen that.
I don't mind you picking up the work, I have so many other things to do.
But I did post a working version.
It wasn't merged for 2.6.22 because it was so close to the merge window
and so much other code was already in Andi queue.
If need be I can dig it up again and repost.
