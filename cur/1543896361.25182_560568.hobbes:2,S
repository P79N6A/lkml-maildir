I think you are telling about case when nmi_watchdog is set to IO_APIC
(cmdline:nmi_watchdog=1). I've faced that problem too.
In case when nmi_watchdog is set to IO_APIC local APIC timers are disabled
kernel uses broadcast timer. External timer(PIT or PM I'm not sure) is used
instead of local CPU apic timers. But even that lapic timers are disabled,
lapic timer handler smp_apic_timer_interrupt() is triggered by broadcast timer
IPIs with the same vector as local APIC IRQs.
The problem is that IPIs are sent to all CPUs except CPU that is sending IPIs,
so local_apic_timer_interrupt won't executed for CPU that initiated IPIs,
instead high level timer code(event_handler) will be called explicitly. It's not a
problem in general but in case of watchdog per CPU variable apic_timer_irqs won't
be incremented, that's why we get lockup.
Steven, I think you have Boot CPU with physical id 3, timer handler(irq 0) runs
and sends broadcast IPIs only on Boot CPU so every time you get lockup on CPU3.
Also I suggest to fix i386 kernel, we should use per CPU statistic:
