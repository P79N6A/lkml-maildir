Very true.

Agreed.
A touch screen driver is pretty small already. The only advantage would 
actually be to support new touchscreens without actually changing the 
kernel, but if we write the code for the touchscreens we already know, 
we will probably not see that many "new" touchscreens with weird protocols.

Actually the string for the gunze touchscreen would be something like 
(constructed from interpreting the gunze.c source code):
"SIZE:11, SYNC:0:5:80,SYNC:40:8:44,SYNC:80:8:13, 
X:12:4:1000,X:20:4:100,X:28:4:10,X:36:4:1, 
Y:52:4:3000,Y:60:4:300,Y:68:4:30,Y:76:4:3, T:2:1:1"
Yes, it doesn't look good ;)
And I agree that we would probably not be able to cover _all_ touchscreens.

I really like this idea :)
A libtouch library that handled calibration (this includes mirroring and 
swapping the coordinates) and other goodies (like filtering out short 
"touch release" events while dragging, etc.) would be a good standard 
interface for all applications.
Being in user space would also mean that the library could do things 
like keeping a /etc/touch.conf file where it would read default 
calibration data, etc.

This certainly seems like a good place for it, yes.

We don't necessarily need floating point (even with 32 bits we have 
plenty of space for fixed point arithmetic), but I agree that this would 
be better handled in a library.
