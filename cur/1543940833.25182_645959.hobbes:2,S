We now at last have some infrastructure that does proper consistency
check of the use of annotation.
So it is by no means getting out-of-hands..
To my understanding Adrian just fixed a potential oops.
You have a driver that surely are thought to be hotplugable -
otherwise qpti_sbus_probe() would not have been annotated __devinit.
And had it ever been hotplugged then you had called a function in
a __init section that was long gone.

For the embedded people a few kb here and there is worth it.

Again - savings when we build-in the drivers.
And without the checks we see 'funny' linker errors on the architectues
that can continue to add the .exit.text in /DISCARD/
