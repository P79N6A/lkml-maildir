} Quick question:  has anyone used the lance.c driver for a 100BaseT

I'd recommend the pcnet32.c driver for that chip, instead.  I was running
it for a little over a year at 100Mbps with no serious trouble.  This was
under Linux/PPC, so there were some endian-ness problems at first but it's
clean now.
