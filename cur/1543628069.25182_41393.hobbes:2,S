This should help somewhat.  Currently, ide-cd.c retries ERROR_MAX
(8) times when it sees an error.  But ide.c is also retrying
ERROR_MAX times when _it_ sees an error, and does a bus reset
after evey 4 failures.  So for each bad sector, you get 64
retries (with typical timouts of 7 seconds each) plus 16 bus
resets per bad sector.
The funny thing is though, we knew after the first read that we
had an uncorrectable medium error.  Try this patch vs 2.4.19-pre7
