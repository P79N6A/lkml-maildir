Actually, both 'cfq' and 'as' are broken, and have been repeatedly reported 
as such.  Deadline is the only one that currently looks sane, and seems like 
a good starting point for a more involved iosched.  But keep in mind, the 
fact that 'cfq' and 'as' are broken may also point to a lower-level block-io 
problem.  So, incrementally improving deadline may help discovering the 
problems both 'cfq' and 'as' are plagued with.
Thanks!
