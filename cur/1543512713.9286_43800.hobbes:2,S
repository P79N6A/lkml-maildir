Interesting questions, and relevant all, but taking
away the fs from devfs deletes some (most) of the
functionality, most notably, the major/minor
limitation, or, having devfs style device nodes.

Unfortunately, while your assertion is logical, I
don't think that the opponents can accept the non-
VFS nature of devfs.
Richard, I have read that devfs escapes using the
standard VFS code. Is it a matter of overhead in
using the VFS, or is it a matter of necessity in
that the special nature of devfs device nodes
would require a new type of special file be created?
I appologize if this has been asked already!
