Subject: 2.4.15-pre5 - unresolved symbols in atm/idt77252.o

I just compiled 2.4.15-pre5, and during "make modules_install":
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in
/lib/modules/2.4.15pre5/kernel/drivers/atm/idt77252.o
depmod:  idt77252_tx_dump
The .config was essentially the one that Mandrake used for their
2.4.8-mdk26 kernel - almost everything included as modules, but I
changed the CPU type to PIII Coppermine.  I can send the .config 
along if needed.

Thanks.
