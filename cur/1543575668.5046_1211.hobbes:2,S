Keeping the memory the same, I repeated the kernel builds
while moving the mouse in a similar way, and switching the
desktop 3 times, same desktops for each test. Yes, I know,
this doesn't test much more, since nothing was swapped out.
These results are even closer. The differences are so slight,
that they are not statistically significant. Hmmm, maybe no
news is good news in this case.
Perhaps if anything is interesting from this test,
it is the negative result: No significant performance
difference for this particular CPU-intensive task on only
two processors.  
I'm sure it would be fun to try this test on a GS320 32-CPU Wildfire.  
I believe a 24-CPU Sun E10000 built a 2.4.0-test7 kernel in about 20 seconds.
Fun, but maybe not too meaningful. Sigh.
Task: make -j3 bzImage for 2.4.0-test12-pre7 kernel tree.
Numbers are seconds to build.
New results (with fiddling with the desktop):
 1       2       3      ave.
143     142     142     142.3   Running 2.2.18 SMP
141     141     142     141.3   Running 2.4.0-test12-pre7 SMP
