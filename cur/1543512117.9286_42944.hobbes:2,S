If you do not have a rw filesystem you hard-code your permissions
anyway.  This sort of system does not resemble your workstation.

And without devfs, we end up with a dozen different implementations
of it under /proc.  Or we end up with SCO Openserver-style device
management. Or each device driver writer has to invent their own
device management system for dynamic devices. 
It doesn't _have_ to be Richard Gooch's Devfs but I have yet

general case.
