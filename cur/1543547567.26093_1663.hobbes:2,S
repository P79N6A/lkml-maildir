Hello all,
as to the problem I described earlier about mysterios growing of the used
inodes number - another strange thing happened.  Without applying any
patch or any changes in the system, the /proc/sys/fs/inode-max was set to
132000.  System continued to increase the number in the
/proc/sys/fs/inode-nr until it reached the number 132030 and then stopped.
The overall performance of the system is good, although file operations
are a bit slow, but load average stays on 1.00 (vs. the normal 0.00).
