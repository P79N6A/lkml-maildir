Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Time-based RFC 4122 UUID generator
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Andrew,
this is a series of two patches for the kernels UUID generator which was already posted two weeks ago to LKML for discussion: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/6/37
1) The first patch fixes a real (although not too critical) bug in the current UUID random generator. It would be great if this could go to Linus soon.
2) The second patch implements a time-based UUID generator acording to RFC 4122. It would be great if you could apply this patch to your mm tree for broader testing.
I did tested the patches sucessfully on x86-32 and hppa (big-endian).
