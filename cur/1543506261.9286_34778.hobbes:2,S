After a bit of conversation with David Hinds, we found and worked
around the problem.  It seems that the pcic in the AMS TravelPro
(O2Micro OZ6836) doesn't probe for irq's properly.  The workaround is
to tell it to not do the probe.
In RedHat, this is done by putting 
  PCIC_OPTS="do_scan=0"
in /etc/sysconfig/pcmcia, and then explicitly excluding irq's you
don't want pcmcia to use in /etc/pcmcia/config.opts.   Works like a
charm.
Posted to linux-kernel in the hopes that it might be useful to others.
