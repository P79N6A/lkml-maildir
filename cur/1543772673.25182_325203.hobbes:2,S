Ah, OK. I thought you were talking about the timespec in pselect(),
because that's what you quoted. 
Yes, we should make the time for ppoll() a 64-bit value, so you can
request a time period longer than 24 days. Shall we also switch to
microseconds?

Indeed. The ABI will be set in stone, but we have some leeway to fix the
implementation details of the kernel's limitations -- such as the fact
that on a 32-bit box with HZ == 1000, any requested timeout above
MAX_LONG milliseconds (24 days) will actually end up being infinite.
