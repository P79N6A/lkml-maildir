Swap prefetch has been around for years, and it's a complete boon for
the desktop user and a noop in any other situation. In addition to the
sp_tester tool which consistently shows a definite advantage, there
are many user reports that show the noticeable improvements it has.
The many people who have tried it out have generally chosen to switch
to patched kernels because of the performance increase.
It's been discussed on the lkml many times before, we've been over
performance, testing and impact. The big question is: why *don't* we
merge it?
