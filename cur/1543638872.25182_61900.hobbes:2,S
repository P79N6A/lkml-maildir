In my opinion, this is perhaps the strongest argument *for* a separate
"giant page" syscall interface.  It will be very hard (perhaps
impossible) to optimize superpages to work efficiently when the ratio
of superpage/basepage grows huge (as, by definition, the kernel would
manage them as a set of basepages).  For example, even if we used a
base page-size of 64KB, a 4GB giant page (as supported by Itanium 2)
would correspond to 65536 base pages.  A superpage of this size would
almost certainly still do a lot better than 65536 base pages, but
compared to a single giant page, it probably stands no chance
performance-wise.
