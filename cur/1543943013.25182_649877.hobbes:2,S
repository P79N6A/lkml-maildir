Subject: [PATCH 2/3] Driver core: Revert "Fix Firmware class name collision"
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Michael E Brown <Michael_E_Brown@dell.com>
This reverts commit 109f0e93b6b728f03c1eb4af02bc25d71b646c59.
The original patch breaks BIOS updates on all Dell machines. The path to
the firmware file for the dell_rbu driver changes, which breaks all of
the userspace tools which rely on it.
Note that this patch re-introduces a problem with i2c name collision
that was previously fixed by this patch.
