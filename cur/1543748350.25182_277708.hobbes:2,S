Well, ok, you're right. I got my wires twisted and misspoke. Today we
really don't, since NTP adjustments only occur on tick boundaries. So
yes, singleshot adjustments are in multiples of ticks right now. But we
do assume ticks arrive at regular periods. If they don't, well, then we
apply it for only one ticks worth, but we've lost a tick so we're wrong
anyway. 
The code above, however, can handle non-regular interrupt intervals,
which is something I think we should assume will occur.
