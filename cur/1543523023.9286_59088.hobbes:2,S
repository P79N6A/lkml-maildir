That rules that out then - obviously there's a hardware problem
somewhere between the University of Aberdeen in SCotland and the
SunSITE UK mirror.

As stated above, that's the SunSITE-UK mirror site, so I would doubt
there's that many CD's. However, the whole site is NFS mountable as
193.63.255.4:/public within the UK, and possibly outside as well.
Note that if you look up the SunSITE.Org.UK domain name, you could get
any of about a dozen different IP addresses, but it was specifically
the one quoted that I wanted checking as that's the only one that can
be accessed from within JA.NET !!!
Best wishes from Riley.
