I never suggested *all* serial ports should be /dev/ttySn, I said that
the built-in ports on the motherboard should be /dev/ttySn.  The
built-in ports can generally be enumerated early on boot in a stable
order, and they should be assigned the low ttySn numbers, regardless
of what chip is used to implement them.
