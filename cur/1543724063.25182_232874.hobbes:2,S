Godwin, surely?
Anyway, if you think that suckversion authors knew C...  Try to read their
decoder/parser/whatever you call the code handling the data stream obtained
from other end of connection.  _Especially_ when it comes to signedness
(of integers, mostly).

... have nothing to do with char; getc() has more legitimate return values
than char can represent.  No matter whether it's signed or unsigned, if
you have
	... char c;
	...
	c = getc();
you have a bug - Dirichlet Principle bites you anyway.
