Your module should fail to load if you can't register a cache. If you
are a good boy and check your return codes from the kmem_cache_create,
you would know that the cache failed and not load the module.
Otherwise, if it failed for other reasons, then you can be causing bugs
later when you go to use it. 
Now this raises the issue of name space, this will bug if two modules
use the same cache name. If this happens with two different vendors,
than the poor user will have to figure out who to blame.
