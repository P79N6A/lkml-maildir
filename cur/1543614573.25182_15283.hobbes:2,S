Agreed. I think almost technical guys assumed that 'KB' (or kB, or kb, or
something ;-) IS 1024 bytes. Know even they starting to loose their
belief about old one, and that new and 'strange' 'KiB'. Imho '1000 bytes =
1 kbytes' was only used by some tricky hardware vendors to trick their
costumers (they could show bigger values ...). But even my sister knows
that when someone's speaking about computers, 'kilo' means 1024, not 1000.
It's like when we declared that direction of electrical current is from
positive to negative. Yes, we CAN change it now, because we know that it's
not the right direction of electrons in real.
So, if the 'technical world' already assumed (imho) that 'kilo' is 1024
in computer technology then we shouldn't change it now ...
