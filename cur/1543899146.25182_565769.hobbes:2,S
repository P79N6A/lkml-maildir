	Hi,
Fuse-san discovered that running the umount that's part of busybox on a PS3
with a recent kernel causes an error message to be printed on the console:
| ioctl32(busybox:1340): Unknown cmd fd(3) cmd(00004c01){t:'L';sz:0} arg(00000000) on /dev/sda1 
On older kernels (e.g. 2.6.16), this doesn't happen.
It can easily be reproduced by installing busybox and running
| busybox umount /mountpoint
on a mounted filesystem (except when using the loop device).
Apparently Busybox uses the LOOP_CLR_FD ioctl when unmounting a file system,
which is supported by the loop device only.
On other block device types, this ioctl is not supported:
  - With a 64-bit application, the block layer returns ENOTTY (Inappropriate
    ioctl for device), while the SCSI layer returns EINVAL (Invalid argument)
  - With a 32-bit application, the compat_ioctl code returns EINVAL (Invalid
    argument) and prints an error on the console (for the first 50
    occurrencies, cfr. fs/compat_ioctl.c:compat_sys_ioctl())
As I understand, compat_ioctl_error() is used to inform the user about ioctl
values that are not yet handled by the compat_ioctl layer. However, LOOP_CLR_FD
doesn't need to be handled (no data to convert between 32-bit and 64-bit), and
it's perfectly valid for a block device to not implement it.
So it's confusing to print this error message.
Is there anything we can do about this?
With kind regards,
