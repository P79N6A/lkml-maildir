Subject: [PATCH} fix defect with kobject memory leaks during del_gendisk

Folks,
Attached is a patch which fixes a few memory leaks in 2.6.0-test5. 
Comments are welcome as to whether or not this patch is the right
solution.
I added the ability to linux MD to generate add and remove hotplug calls
on RAID START and STOPs.  To achieve this, I use the del_gendisk call
which deletes the gendisk, delete the children kobjects, and delete the
parent (in this case, mdX) kobject.
Unfortunately it appears that del_gendisk uses kobject_del to delete the
kobject.  If the kobject has a ktype release function, it is not called
in the kobject_del call path, but only in kobject_unregister.
This patch changes the functionality so the release function (in this
case the block device release function in drivers/block/genhd.c) is
called by changing the kobject_del to kobject_unregister.
Without this patch, at least 3 memory leaks occur on removal of a block
device using the del_gendisk function.
Thanks
