Works like a charm, only one comment:
Mounting my vfat partitions gave me this error:
FAT: codepage or iocharset option didn't specified
     File name can not access proper (mounted as read-only)
which was easily fixed by supplying a iocharset= mount option. But according 
to the man page of mount:
       iocharset=value
              Character set to use for converting between 8 bit characters and
              16 bit Unicode characters. The default is iso8859-1.  Long file-
              names are stored on disk in Unicode format.
the default is iso8859-1. Has this default gone haywire somewhere?
Thanks anyway for another great kernel :)
Jan
