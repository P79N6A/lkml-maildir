Sorry for wasting your time. :'( Maybe you can provide your solution
for PPS support and get it included into kernel tree so we can use it
and live happy!  :)
Several people (Andrew, David, et all) wrote to me a lot of letters
without loosing their patience. I'm a poor programmer, not a «guru»
like you, and I need more time to understand things. I'm trying to do
my best. :)
However I'm very proud to be a "poor programmer" (slow in
understanding things) but a gentleman rather than a "kernel-guru" like
you but totally ill-mannered.
Thanks anyway for your (precious) time,
Rodolfo
P.S. A gentle programmer just wrote to me a letter where, proposing
code/patches, showed to me possible good solutions, so I think I'm
going to modify again the locking code soon.
