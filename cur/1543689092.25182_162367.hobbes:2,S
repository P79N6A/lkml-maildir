No, it would undoubtedly make the kernel larger and slower.

Most of the authors of Linux would prefer a little holding back, if
the alternative was widespread binary-only drivers that they couldn't
debug or fix, or learn from, and a slower, larger kernel.
Of course we might be mistaken.
But please take a look at other kernels which _do_ offer a rigid
interface to binary plugins.  Then ask yourself what social phenomena
created the Linux which is exciting and useful as it is, that makes
you want to write drivers for it now instead of those other kernels.
