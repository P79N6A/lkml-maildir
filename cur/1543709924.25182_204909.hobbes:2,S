Hi,
I want to add per-port pm function to 8250's serial port.
Doesn't the method exist now?

struct uart_8250_port {
        struct uart_port        port;
        struct timer_list       timer;          /* "no irq" timer */
        struct list_head        list;           /* ports on this IRQ */
        unsigned int            capabilities;   /* port capabilities */
        unsigned short          rev;
        unsigned char           acr;
        unsigned char           ier;
        unsigned char           lcr;
        unsigned char           mcr_mask;       /* mask of user bits */
        unsigned char           mcr_force;      /* mask of forced bits */
        unsigned char           lsr_break_flag;
        /*
         * We provide a per-port pm hook.
         */
        void                    (*pm)(struct uart_port *port,                  <-- here
                                      unsigned int state, unsigned int old);
};
