	I hate to post just to say me too, but we couldn't run 2.2.16 for
more than a few hours and even 2.2.17 would stop responding with a
load average >200 right around the time of our heaviest usage
and never come back. Assuming 2.2.18pre2aa2 doesn't crash in the
next 2 weeks (the original problem we upgraded to fix) then we'll
probably never change our kernel :) (and my associate who
believes in windows won't have anything left to complain about).
