I didn't mess with dst->output, I simply replaced the argument to
ip_forward(..., skb->dst->output) with ip_forward(..., neigh_compat_output)

Can you explain this in more detail?  I am not touching the
upper-layer protocol headers at all.  I don't need to know about them.
If the 2.2.10 box can talk to a 2.0.36 box, then that layer should
still work.  I just need to muck with the mss for that route.

Yes, I know it can cause bad performance.  In fact, maybe what should
be done is to send back an ICMP message only for tunnel mode packets,
and not for transport mode.  I am not presently differentiating.

Yes, I know, that is why Marc did not use it.  I was using it in 2.0,
since skb_copy_expand is a customised skb_copy().  In fact, skb->len
is not complete enough.  I want to make the skb larger by 'headroom'
plus 'tailroom' over the (obviously too small, otherwise I would have
used it) existing skb.  This is why I use skb->end - skb->head, which
includes all of the existing headroom and tailroom which is needed for
bits that have been or will be stripped off for processing.

Right, I am not trying to play with the dst cache, just use the right
entry.
Take the following example:
	A-----B=======C==========D=========E------F
A, F are endhosts which know nothing of IPSEC
B, E are security GWs, one foot in a trusted network, the other in the
	big, bad internet
C, D are the nexthop routers from the security GWs
- ----- is an unprotected local link from an endhost to a security GW
===== is an IPSEC tunnel
Say we have a tunnel mode connection set up from B to E to cover
traffic from A to F.  Say we also have a tunnel or transport mode
connection set up from B to E to cover packets with source and
destination addresses of B or E (which includes previously
encapsulated packets from A to F and vice versa).  The routing table
will look like:
Destination	Gateway		Iface
A-B_subnet	-		eth1
B		-		lo
B-C_subnet	-		eth0
default		C		eth0
E		C		ipsec0
E-F_subnet	C		ipsec0
Since the packet destination has not changed for any packets going
from B to E or the device and next hop have not changed for any
packets going from A to F, then B to E, we don't have any physical I/F
to point to in the dst cache.
