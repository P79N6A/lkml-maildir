I should explain a little more ....
The current dbench is showing way too much variance on this test to be
really useful. Here are the numbers for 5 runs of dbench 10 on
2.6.10-rc2 and 2.6.10-rc2-mm2:
2.6.10-rc2          325
		    320
		    364
		    360
		    347
-mm2                347
		    371
		    411
		    322
		    384
I've solved this variance problem in NBENCH by making the runs fixed
time rather than fixed number of operations, and adding a warmup
phase. I need to do the same to dbench in order to get sane numbers
out that would be at all useful for a binary patch search.
The current dbench worked OK when computers were slower, but now it is
completing its runs so fast that the noise is just silly.
Cheers, Tridge
