yes, there's you at least.  me, i have trouble using a 21041 card with
drivers later than 0.91.  this includes 0.91g and 0.91x.

yes.  i've complained about my problems.  a few others have the same
thing as i too.

i don't know.  you can find 0.89h, 0.91, 0.91g and 0.91x.  other
versions are apparently in the great bit bucket in the sky never to be
found again.  it's hard to regress when there is a spotty chain of
patches.

and since the webpage doesn't mention it, you can find these versions
at

ftp://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/linux/drivers/kern-2.3>
best of luck
