No, that's why I said you would need hooks into swapon and
swapoff. Then it would adjust on the fly. Else it's useless from the
usability point of view. With these hooks it's easy to do.

And I have set it to 400MB on a 256MB box just fine ;-) How could you
do these two setup generally without knowing your hardware. 20MB tmpfs
on a 40MB machine can be a desaster btw.
