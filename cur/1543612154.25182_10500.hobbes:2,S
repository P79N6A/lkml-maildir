hi
Are there any ways to tell Linux to use some sort of readahead
functionality that'll give me the ability to schedule I/O more loosely, so
some 100 files can be read concurrently without ruining the system by
seeking all the time?
I've tried to alter /proc/sys/vm/(min|max)-readahead, but it doesn't have
any effect...
