ermm, ok. It is even more complicated. Section 2 of the ACPI specs speaks of 
Global Power states and device power states. 
So we ge the follwing, with G= ACPI Global power state, S = (ACPI?) Sleep 
State, D = ACPI Device power state,
G3 = Mechanical off = everything D3
G2=S5=soft off = everything D3
G1=S4 = Hibernation = everything D3
G1=S3/S2=Sleeping = parts in D2/D1/(D0?)
G0=S0=Working = evrything in D0
/proc/acpi/sleep talks about the S states, so when I want STR, which is S3 i 
echo 3 > /proc/acpi/sleep.
The PCI state would also be 3 for most devices, I think. Pci state 1 or 2 
cannot be expected to be supported.

ACK.

I think that file doesn't expect Global power states, as thats only on, 
sleeping, off, but sleep states. However I don't see the translation into PCI 
sleep states either. But there must be some translation, as a 3 is translatet 
into a 2 here (which than failes..)
I suppose some cleanup and documentation is required here.

Alex
