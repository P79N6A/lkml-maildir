Yowsza!  I've been looking forward to this ... :)
I'll look it over and see how the 2.6 merge goes, and probably run
some revisions by you.  The autoconfiguration updates will make this
more complicated, since g_ether is starting to support a more dynamic
configuration model; the HH.org crew need that, so PDA Linux distros
don't need to hard-wire as much knowledge about hardware targets
into their kernels.

Which is exactly what a lot of Linux solution providers need to see;
I'm sure this will get a lot of use.  Applause!
(Although I personally would prefer that Microsoft adopt vendor-neutral
protocols, instead of pushing the rest of the industry to adopt things
that are MSFT-biased ... for some reason, they haven't listened to almost
anyone on such topics.  Oh well.  ;)

I'll add them to the official "thank you" list on the
