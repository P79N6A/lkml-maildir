Subject: [PATCH] 2.2.18pre2: fencepost error in __ioremap() [AGP]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The AGP patches add some code to __ioremap.  That code seems to me to
have a fencepost error.
In the below hunk, note that temp_end is set to "temp_addr+(size-1)".
It points _at_ the last page to be examined, not beyond it.  So the
loop should be controlled by a "<=" test, not a "<" test.  Without
this patch, the last page in the range is not tested for reservation.
