Realistically, the only sane way to do this is to set our foot down
and say: UTF-8 is *the* encoding.  A good step in that direction would
be to set utf-8 to be the default NLS in the kernel, but as long as
people keep the whole sick idea that we can continue to use
locale-dependent encoding we're in for a world of hurt.
That's really the long and short of it.  Until people are willing to
say "we support UTF-8, anything else and it's anyone's guess what
happens" then nothing is going to happen.
