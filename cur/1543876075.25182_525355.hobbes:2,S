Do we actually have cards with IRDA switches? We are kind of tight in
input KEY_ namespace so I am hesitant to add defines before there
actual users.

Not in net?

I can go both ways on this one as it crosses line between input and
rfkill. I think from user/Kconfig point of view it is better to keep
it together with rfkill: user woudl select rfkill option and right
then and there decide if he wants to give the kernel ability to
automatically control RF switche

No, I do not want to change name - I have bunch of drivers that can me
converted to use this skeleton - wistron, aaedkbd, hdaps, ams,
cobalt_btns. It is also pure input-related function so it is the only
module that definitely belongs to drivers/input/misc.

Not quite. Drivers that have buttons do not require polling still
should create an input device and register it with input layer. Except
that with interrupt-driven devices there is not much you can stub out
so you just have to do input_allocate_device/input_register_device.

No, rfkill-input is not an input device but input handler (or input
interface). It routes input events from buttons into switches (see
below).

This is the input device visible to userspace and kernel. It polls
state of the button and sends KEY_WLAN/KEY_BLUETOOTH events through
input layer. They get distributed through various input handlers such
as evdev and rfkill-input. Evdev provides route for events to
userspace where application can listen to events and then toggle RF
switches according to the current policy via
/sys/class/rfkill/rfkillXXX/state. Rfkill-input provides in-kernel
route for events into rfkill system. If rfkill-input is loaded
switches that are not claimed by userspace will be toggled
automatically.
Does this make sense?
Note that we don't start polling the state of button until tare are
users of that input device. If rfkill-input is loaded then there is a
user right away. Otherwise we wait for userspace to open evdev node.

I know but for refcounted objects you can't really tell when they will
actually be freed. It depends when their last user drops off.
BTW, I can't either as I don't have any laptops with RF swtches ;)
