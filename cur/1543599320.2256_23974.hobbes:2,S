I just wanted to say that the VM balancing stuff in 2.4.8 and 2.4.9 doesnt
work very well. 2.4.8 and .9 will use 200 Mbyte of my swap after just 6
hours! I got 512 Mbyte RAM, 256 Mbyte swap.
I have now switched back to 2.4.7. Uptime 6 days and 11 Mbyte swap used.
I would prefer if Linux used as little swap as possible. It only gets
slower.
