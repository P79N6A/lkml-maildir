If you have RH's /usr/src directory installed, you can cd to
/usr/src/linux-2.4/configs and pick from several pre-built config files.
they work nicely. I use them to build kernel.org kernels. It's *much*
easier to make a few config changes to their config file than starting
from scratch. They tend to be highly modular though... some people don't
like this.
Good luck!
