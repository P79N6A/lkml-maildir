I'm currently running 2.4.5 here and I'm considering 2.4.10 but am
somewhat more nervous about this release than others based on the
number of reports of problems I'm seeing...
What would be the advice of others in terms of moving up from 2.4.5
which has been rock solid here? 
Would you recommend doing the upgrade or waiting for 2.4.11 or is
there a middle ground release (2.4.6,7,8,9) that you'd recommend.
