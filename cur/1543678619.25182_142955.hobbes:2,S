Hi there!
Well, that masterpeiece of Software, the 2.5.7x series is now running on
all computers I got my hands on (all i386 and physically accessable, the
others will be treated later) :) 
I must say, it runs great, especially on servers that thing does not
crash more often than 2.4.x. Well indeed I saw an Oops on my Server with
2.4.x which I did not debug, I put 2.5.72-mm2 onto it :)
These Kernels (2.5.7x-mmx) did not give an Oops too me and died if
running (lvm1 -> lvm2 and such things). Simultaniously switching to
devfs was no Problem...
I got some freezes with 2.5.70-mm9 and 2.5.71-mmx which seem to have
disappeared, lets see...
However, there is only one Problem left for me, before this one can be
called 2.6.0: The keys on my PS/2 IBM Keyboard are bouncing very often!
I switched from an USB Logitech Keyboard back to my old school, clicking
PC-102 IBM Keyboard ATM and the Key bouncing was back immmediatly :(
Over ssh connections it is even more extreme, I don't know why.
Are there any approaches to debug or whatsoever that thing? I saw many
changes to the input layer on this mailing list since 2.5.70 so I gave
this one Kernel here another chance :) (see signature). I just wanted to
say, the Problem hasn't gone yet, not more, and keep on hacking this
great mastepiece of Kernel :-)
Regards, Konsti
