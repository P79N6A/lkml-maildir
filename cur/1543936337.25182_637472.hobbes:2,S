Ditto.
One typical problem is that on "Intel(r) 3 Series Experss Chipset Family"
MMCONFIG probing of the BAR #2 (frame buffer address) of integrated graphics
device locks up the machine (depending on BIOS settings, of course).
This happens because the frame buffer of IGD has higher decode priority
than MMCONFIG range, as stated in Intel docs...
