Hi Ingo,
  I finally managed it to reboot when I was doing some other tests with bttv.
But during bootup it hanged up in fsck. Fsck is sometime running, sometime
uninterruptible sleeps (as ctrl-scrollock says). Shift-scrolllock says
(copied by hand):
Mem-info:
Free pages:   126240kB (126240kB HighMem)
( Free: 31560, lru_cache: 30315 (256 512 768)
  DMA: 0 0 0 0.... = 0kB
  Normal: 0 0 0 0 0... = 0kB
  HighMem: 12*4kB 2*8kB 0*16kB 1*32kB 1*64kB 1*128kB 0*256kB 0*512kB
           1*1024kB 61*2048kB = 126240kB
Swap cache: add 0, delete 0, find 0/0
Free swap:   530136kB
65536 pages of RAM
32768 pages of HIGHMEM
1658 reserved pages
1266 pages shared
0 pages swap cached
0 pages in page table cache
Buffer memory:  119360kB
  CLEAN: 29838 buffers, 3 used (last=29838), 0 locked, 0 protected, 0 dirty
 LOCKED: 1 buffers, 0 used (last=0), 0 locked, 0 protected, 0 dirty
Networking buffers in use : 0
Total network buffer allocations : 1
Total failed network buffer allocs : 0
IP fragment buffer size : 0
So it looks to me like that either I should buy more memory or you should
teach kswapd about one more different memory area... Otherwise things
do not play fair together. And as buing more memory problem only makes
less probable, but does not fix it... :-(
                                   Thanks for your time,
                                        Petr Vandrovec
