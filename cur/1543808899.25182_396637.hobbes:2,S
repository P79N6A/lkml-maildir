I think the general consensus from kernel developers and cdrecord users alike 
is that the only logical way to refer to devices in Linux is via /dev/* and 
any other method is broken and illogical.
If you want stable b,t,l junk, submit a clean patch for Linux yourself. Either 
way, 99.99% of cdrecord *users* want to use /dev/cdrom whether b,t,ls are 
stable or not. The code to do the latter is already written, working, and 
well-tested-- you just need to drop an artificial warning.
