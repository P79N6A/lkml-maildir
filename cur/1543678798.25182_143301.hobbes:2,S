At least on 2.4 (I use 21-ck3), it appears to be I/O starvation that
gets xmms, not scheduler starvation.  When xmms skips for me, there's
load, but there's also usually some idle time.  The common thread seems
to be heavy I/O on the drive xmms is using, possibly combined with a
(formerly?) interactive process (evolution rebuilding my LKML index, for
example) doing the disk I/O.  Because of the assorted I/O scheduler
changes in 2.5, this is unlikley to be the problem there.
