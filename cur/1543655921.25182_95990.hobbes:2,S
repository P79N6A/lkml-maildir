  The RTO steps in only when there is a need to RETRANSMIT.
  For that reason, it makes no sense to place its start
  any shorter.

  You can have this by doing carefull non-blocking socket
  coding, and protocol traffic monitoring along with
  protocol level keepalive ping-pong packets to have
  something flying around  (like NJE ping-pong, not
  that every IBM person knows what that is/was..)

  I don't.

  We try not to kill overloaded network routers while they
  are trying to compensate some line breakage and doing
  large-scale network topology re-routing.

  No.  I have had LAN spanning-tree flaps taking 60 seconds
  (actually a bit over 30 seconds), and years ago Linux's
  TCP code timed out in that.  It was most annoying to
  use some remote system thru such a network...

  When things _fail_ in the lan, what would be sensible value ?
  How long will such abnormality last ?
  In overload, resending quickly won't help a bit, just raise
  the backoff (and prolong overload.)
  Loosing a packet sometimes, and that way needing to retransmit
  is the gray area I can't define quickly.  If it is rare, it
  really does not matter.  If it happens often, there could be
  so serious trouble that having quicker retransmit will only
  aggreviate the trouble more.

  You are looking for "STP" perhaps ?
  It has a feature of waking all streams retransmits, in between 
  particular machines, when at least one STP frame travels in between
  the hosts.
  I can't find it now from my RFC collection.  Odd at that..
  Neither as a draft.  has it been abandoned ?

  More and more of STP ..
