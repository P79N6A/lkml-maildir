I think we can avoid keventd altogether by using a periodic timer (say 10ms)
to check for completion of an RC update. The timer may be active
only if only if there is any RCU going on in the system - that way
we still don't have any impact on the rest of the kernel.
I am working on such a thing - but it will take me a little bit
of time to figure out how to do this in linux.
Thanks
