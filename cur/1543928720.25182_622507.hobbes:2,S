While I realise that, I'm telling you that the _problem_ is being
caused by the wrong handler being used.

AT91 has edge based GPIO interrupts which need special handling so
edges aren't missed.  That's what the edge handler is there for - to
ensure that edges aren't missed while the interrupt is soft-disabled.
SA1100 and PXA have exactly the same setup.  They use the correct
handler.  Why is AT91 special?

Clearly no, I disagree.

Who knows.  The patch says nothing about that change.  The change was
never copied to me, so I've never reviewed it (and had it been, I
would've indicated that the change was wrong.)
