Oops.  Yes, in the past BLK_DEV_SGIIOC4 was the core abstraction config
symbol.  That was fixed a release or two ago, but obviously I've been
working on the external interrupt stuff for a while.  Fixed.

Yes, the Altix 330 uses third-party chips to provide base I/O functions.
Other future Altix products will similarly lack IOC4 (at least in their
base configuration).

Sorry.  Lindent took to mungeing my source (indenting in structure
definitions in particular) in unreadable ways, so I stopped using it.
Old coding styles die hard and all.

For security correctness we cannot allow this page to be mapped by
anything larger than a 16K page, as that would allow the user access
to control registers which are not harmless if exposed.
However, the loss of functionality isn't silent.  In ioc4_extint_mmap()
we return -ENXIO if the mapping cannot be performed for the aforementioned
reason.  A well-written application will check for failures from mmap(2).

It was just one of many things where I coded defensively and intended
to revisit it later.  Unfortunately the revisit never took place.
Thanks for the catch -- fixed now.
Thanks,
Brent
