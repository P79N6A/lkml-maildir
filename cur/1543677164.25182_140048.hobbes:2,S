Hi,
I would like to limit the maximum resident memory size
of a process within a threshold, i.e. if its virtual
memory footprint exceeds this threshold, it needs to
swap out pages *only* from within its VM space.
First, is there a way this can be done at application
level ? The setrlimit interface seems to contain an
option for specifying max resident set size, but it
doesnt seem like it is implemented as of 2.4 -- am I
wrong ?
If the kernel doesnt currently support it, is there an
efficient way (data structure etc) to traverse the
resident set of a *process* in lru fashion ?  All the
page replacement and swapping code work on the entire
page lists -- is there any simple way to group these
per process ?
thanks for any pointers,
Muthian.
