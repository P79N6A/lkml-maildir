8-bit binary encoding, the same for single charset patch - we don't
want mail systems to change the encoding.
Unfortunately you can't display anything like that inline I think.
That means email may be unreliable in such cases (except maybe when
both sides use UTF-8 and the patch contains only UTF-8), git/ftp/etc.
will be fine.
