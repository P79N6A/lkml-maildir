Yes it looks to be the case, and PCI_DEVICE_CLASS() macros don't help as
they assign in differing orders.
The following drivers appear to be broken from this
Aec62xx.c			All	
Serverworks.c			OSB4/CSB5/CSB6/CSB6-2/HT1000
Actual breakage will affect CSB6/CSB6-2/HT1000, and all the AEC6xxx
chips in various ways.
Unfortunately it appears I missed the bug, nobody checked the diff and
nobody ever ran -mm with these chipsets so it somehow got through. I'll
look at rolling a patch but it might be Monday. Until then anyone
rolling a 2.6.18 tree should revert the PCI table changes in serverworks
and aec62xx.
