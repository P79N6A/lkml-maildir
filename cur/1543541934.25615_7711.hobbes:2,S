just as an aside, there's a cute operation which tells you if there's
exactly 1 bit on in a word, which in this case would look like:
	if (len & (len - 1))
		goto out;	/* not a power of 2 */
it's easiest to prove it with pencil and paper, and represent len in
binary form.
(there's a natural extension of this to counting 1-bits in a word...
which is a fun interview question i hear.)
