I'm just thinking whether the ISA PnP hardware related modules should depend
on isa-pnp.o at all 
(I mean having different behaviour of a the SAME (compiled) module depending
on whether isa-pnp.o is available or not)
It is just adding some persistent pointers for isa-pnp functions to the
kernel and teaching the modules to use request_module(). Probably also some
hacking to keep away from already used ISA PnP hardware during
initialization...
Also implementing "nopnp" option should be mandatory, IMHO.

I see no objection if __init for modules is implemented...
