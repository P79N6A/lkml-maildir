Mmm.. broken only for 64-bit userspace, it seems.
I've recompiled the same app against 32-bit libs,
and it works just fine on that 64-bit system,
as well as on 32-bit systems.
But not when compiled for pure 64-bit operation on a 64-bit system.
Looks tricky .. must be a change somewhere that assumes
a pointer/long is 32-bits or something.
