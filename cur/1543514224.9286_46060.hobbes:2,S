On my network the problem is fixated on some particular sites.
However I can't think of any reason whatsoever why it happens. A
friend of mine has exactly the same problem with exactly the same
symptoms and it's occurring on the same sites I'm having trouble
with.
If it helps, at least these two are problematic:

I haven't experienced this problem before. It started occurring
sometime around 2.2.10 or 2.2.11. Maybe it was happening before, I
just haven't noticed it before.

I thought about doing that. It's just  that my 486/66 router is
slightly slow for running a http cache. :)

Hmm.. I've seen this  phenomenon happening, too. I have a DNS server
set up for my intranet, which was supposed to forward non-intranet
requests to a name server outside the masquarade gateway, but the
packets never went out. I solved the problem by making the DNS server
a cacheing one. However, normal nslookup requests directed to any DNS
outside from within my intranet still work OK.

I'll be sure to do that.
