Why? Macros (and inlined functions) have the advantage that they
enforce good policy. Doing 'task->cred->uid = a' on tasks other than
'current' is in general not a very safe thing to do. This sort of
issue w.r.t. safe policies should in particular be worrying you when
you start adding CRED_CLONE...
There are good precedents for this sort of argument: see
'set_current_state()' & friends.
In addition, those macros would allow you to set up compatibility with
2.4.x and simplify patch backports.
As for changing the structure: As I said previously I'd like to unify
all those { fsuid, fsgid, group } things into a proper ucred, so that
we can share these objects around the VFS, and cache them...
Your 'struct cred' as it stands will not suffice to do all that since
it does not provide the necessary Copy On Write protection. (For
instance if some thread temporarily raises my process privileges, I
will *not* want all my already opened 'struct file's to suddenly gain
root access).
Cheers,
