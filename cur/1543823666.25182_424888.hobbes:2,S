It's pretty clear to me that /bin/vgscan is a wrapper to either vgscan.lvm1
or vgscan.lvm2 depending on what it supported in the kernel. 2.4 only
supports LVM1 in mainline. There are patches to support LVM2 on 2.4,
but to be honnest, I'm not sure about the exhaustive list. All I know
is that you have to start with the device mapper :

I hope it will help you
