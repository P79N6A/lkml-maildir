Of course you can!  This is what we do for linked lists too.  Here's  
an example of how to get a pointer to your wombat_controller given  
the user_beancounter pointer:
struct wombat_controller *wombat = containerof 
(ptr_to_user_beancounter, struct wombat_controller, counter);
The containerof(PTR, TYPE, MEMBER) returns a pointer to the parent  
object of type "TYPE" whose member "MEMBER" has address "PTR".
