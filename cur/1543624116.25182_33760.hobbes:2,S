I just got a new motherboard (asus dual athlon).  It has a
couple of issues...
There isn't a BIOS upgrade for this board availale yet so I
expect some of it is just BIOS bugs.
Note for anyone purchasing this board in the future: You *must* set 'PnP
aware OS' to 'No' otherwise nothing works at all (all the devices try to 
claim IRQ0)... that one stumped me for a couple of hours.
1.  The APIC doesn't work.  It gets as far printing '..TIMER: xxxx'
(io_apic.c line 1507 in my tree) then hangs.  Using 'noapic' gets
around this.
2.  'halt -p' doesn't power off, it only suspends, and the power button 
doesn't do anything.  /proc/acpi/button has two directories called 
'power' in it and one called 'sleep'.  All 3 directories are empty.
I guess this is just a dodgy BIOS but surely ACPI shouldn't create two 
identical directories???
None of the devices are listed in the PCI database yet... AFAIK this 
board is AMD 762MP based.  Without ripping apart the machine I can't 
tell you the exact chip numbers, though.
