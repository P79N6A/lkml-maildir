Wouldn't it be better to correct the MTRR, if possible? As far as I read
here (LKML), the BIOS did not merge the entries, and this waste caused the
last part of the memory not to be covered. Off cause you can't DTRT for all
buggy MTRR setups, but if you're lucky, optionally merging the MTRR and
adding the rest of the memory may sometimes do the trick ...
