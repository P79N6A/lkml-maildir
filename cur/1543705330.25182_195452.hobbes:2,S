for legacy hardware that cannot generate any hotplug event when
connected.
Parallel port Jaz that I have. I usually have it switched off
or simply disconnected (let's leave the question of how safe is
to plug in parallel port cable aside). When I turn it on there is
no hotplug event available. Meaning
- either I have to load ppa (given current implementation)
- or initiate rescan of ppa scsi bus (if it is ever changed to new
  model)
I guess other parallel port devices share the same issue.
so there are cases when "action on access" makes sense.
