A read lease should mean that there are no writers at all.
If we were to allow the current process to open for write, then that
would still mean that nobody else can get a lease. In effect you have
been granted a lease with exclusive semantics (i.e. a write lease). You
might as well request that instead of pretending it is a read lease.
