I run a shell server and I am running into a problem with not having enough
file descriptors and keep getting errors like this:
/bin/sh: error while loading shared libraries: libtermcap.so.2: cannot open
shared object file: Error 23
error 23 as defined in errno.h is file table overflow, how do I increase the
number of file descriptors available on my system, and is there an absolute
limit or a reason not to raise it to a large number?  I am currently running
kernel 2.2.17 UP, any help you can provide will be greatly appreciated.
