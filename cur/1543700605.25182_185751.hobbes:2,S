The comments were added in Linux 0.99.1, and I'm not sure what was the
source.  For example, Linux has:
#define ENOTTY          25      /* Not a typewriter */
Solaris:
#define ENOTTY  25      /* Inappropriate ioctl for device       */
Current POSIX:
    [ENOTTY]
        Inappropriate I/O control operation.
I couldn't find any historic Minix header files.  Minix 2 has:
#define ENOTTY        (_SIGN 25)  /* inappropriate I/O control operation */
