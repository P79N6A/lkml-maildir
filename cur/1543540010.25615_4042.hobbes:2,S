Hi,
I looked back through the archives and noticed this had been raised before,
but the problem is certainly not fixed in the 2.4 testX kernels.
Where 2.2 kernels work fine, v2.4 kernels won't find any devices when
scanning behind DECchip 21150 PCI bridges. In more detail, the initial
pci_read_config_dword() in pci_scan_device() returns 0xffffffff (the case
when a slot is empty).
I have experimented with the different kernel pci options, off and conf2 list
the devices but the messages sent to the log don't inspire confidence in the
system stability.
These bridges are quite common, my test example is a dell latitude notebook
which uses the bridge to handle the docking station. I contacted a few of the
people originally involved who basically gave up and went back to 2.2
kernels.
Any suggestions?
