How does one detect deadlock?  This is a serious question, because I am
obviously pretty miserable at it.  :)  In my case, I had a page fault
interrupting my stack trace so I couldn't "see" events going all the way
back to when the kernel thread initially grabbed that lock...

okay, understood.  :)  In my patch "#3" I take an approach that is
basically what you describe... I tally up the counts and then print out
the missed message count when the next successful printk comes around...

What I was thinking is that I could save a pointer to the message format
string and then print it out later... upon further thought it's pretty
obvious that the format string might not be around any longer... and to be
safe I'd have to make a copy... back to the original problem!  :)
