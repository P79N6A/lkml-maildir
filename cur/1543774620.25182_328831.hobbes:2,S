Yes it has, and I may have even posted about it, but that would be a 
year plus back into ancient history Russell.  You mention another 
required patch also?  Where might it be obtained?

I'm also getting bounces involving the address in the CC: line,
Russell King <rmk+lkml@arm.linux.org.uk>
While I can goto vz and add that address to the incoming whitelist, I 
doubt that would do you any good.  Looks like I need to bookmark that 
page and start using it more often.  Did I mention how bad vz sucks?  
Unforch, only game in this neck of the appalacians (hell I can't even 
spell it right), sorry.
Anyway, your domain name is now in the vz whitelist.
