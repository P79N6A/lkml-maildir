Me too ;)
But sometimes we really want to avoid flushing the cache.
Andrew's user space LD_PRELOAD+fadvise based tool fit nicely here.

In fact I have talked to Jens about it in last year's kernel summit.
The patch below explains itself.

Subject: cost based page reclaim
Cost based page reclaim - a minimalist implementation.
Suppose we cached 32 small files each with 1 page, and one 32-page chunk from a
large file.  Should we first drop the 32-pages which are read in one I/O, or
drop the 32 distinct pages, each costs one I/O? (Given that the files are of
equal hotness.)
Page replacement algorithms should be designed to minimize the number of I/Os,
instead of the number of page faults. Dividing the cost of I/O by the number of
pages it bring in, we get the cost of the page. The bigger page cost, the more
'lives/bloods' the page should have.
This patch adds life to costly pages by pretending that they are
referenced more times. Possible downsides:
- burdens the pressure of vmscan
- active pages are no longer that 'active'
