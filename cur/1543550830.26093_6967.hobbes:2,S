It's a .h file just for the ease-of-use sake now. I'm planning to turn
it into a .c library file. However, that requires modificating the
makefiles and I needed a drop-in replacement for the moment.

Just make sure you specify idebus=37 to the kernel, so that the driver
has a chance to compute the correct timing.
