It's an MSI-6120 SMP board.

I just tried a vanilla ac5 on my server and it locks as well on the
Realtek. The ATX switch was still functional though. I have to add that on
my other machine where did most of the testing, I usually used the reset
button, the ATX thing there was just a tried once, failed once. On my
server I tried twice. The lock-ups were identical except the ATX switch
kept working.
My server is an ASUS XP55T2P4 UP.

Is anyone else able to use the vanilla rtl8139 in ac5?
