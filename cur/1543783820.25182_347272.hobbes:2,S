How do you put pressure on hardware manufacturers for getting them to 
release the specs?
If they are able to write "supported by Linux" on their products anyway 
because there's a driver that runs under NdisWrapper?
Or if people return/don't buy the hardware because of missing Linux 
support reducing the revenue of the hardware manufacturer by some $$ ?
