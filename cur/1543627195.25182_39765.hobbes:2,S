well it's just an idea just now. In order to do this from code in rom,
I immagine it would just dump physical memory to a raw partition,
using polling ide drivers in LinuxBIOS.  This is probably a step
backwards, compared to modern crash dumps, but it would
allow zero alteration of memory.
It may be possible to do with a standard flash size of 128KiB,
though, which would allow virtually all motherboards to support it.
