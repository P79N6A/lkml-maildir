While we are at it, that would also fix the idiocy with "v7 and sysvfs live
in the same module, need to edit modules.conf to make mount -t v7 ... work".
I can easily think of many other examples of that sort.  Hell, after a
look at /etc/modules.conf on a Debian box...  And yes, stuff with default
options for soundcards... _ouch_
Is there any chance to get that done in 2.4?  Removal of defaults from
modprobe binary is a different story, but at least getting rid of
temptation to add new ones would be a Nice Thing(tm).  Adding relevant
stuff on the kernel side wouldn't break anything and could be tested
gradually...
I'm more than willing to help with that; if you start doing something
of that kind in 2.4 - count me in.  AFAICS it can be done without
breaking compatibility and it's long overdue.
