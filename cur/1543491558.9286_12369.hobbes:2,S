Well as Horst pointed out to me the C compiler shouldn't really optimize
it away! It looks like a C compiler bug. (I know it's offtopic but I post
it here too because maybe somebody read my previous email).
We may want to add some asm-volatile-nop somewhere for example between a
__sti/__cli pair to allow some irq to run in the meantime.
And the point is that the compiler shouldn't really look inside the asm
string at all as I thought in first place developing the code (and as
Horst pointed out to me now).
If somebody need a testcase ask to MikeG ;).
