Why excactly does the partition table say 450 cylinders when the kernel
believes it to be 448 cylinders?  Someone is wrong.  Either the device
was partitioned wrong and hence formated wrong, or whatever driver the
kernel is using to read it is broken and returns the wrong size for the
device.
I have never heard of /dev/tfa0p* either.  What is that?

Identical.  Sure makes it look like a driver error on the linux side in
that case.
