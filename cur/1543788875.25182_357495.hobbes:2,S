1) Would you prefer to change arch/i386/Kconfig
config NR_CPUS
     int "Maximum number of CPUs (2-255)"
     range 2 255
2) The unlock sequence is not anymore inlined. It appears twice or three times 
in the kernel.
3) i386 code is often taken as the base when a port is done. For example 
x86_64 has the same problem.
