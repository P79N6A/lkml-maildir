I don't know why I didn't see the corruption the first time around.  
However, I repeated the tests with Linus' floppy update and saw the same 
thing you did.
dd if=/dev/fd0 of=floppyimage
produced corrupt output, as did a dd write to floppy command.

Thanks.  Adding your workaround produced correct outputs.  I hope we can 
some other eyes on the code and get it integrated into mainline.
