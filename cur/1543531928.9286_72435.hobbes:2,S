Yes, although you can increase your rlimit.
I just wrote a little recursive program to explore stack behavior. It's
amazing how much programming a person can do while still not learning a
lot of little details about the underlying system. :-) I've learned a lot
in the past week or two...

Yes, I'm something like this must happen. Otherwise every process would
have a vsize of at least 8 megs.

Ok, so you aren't doing away with overcommit entirely, just trying to
guarantee memory for one process. Makes sense... but the same old problem
still exists if some other task runs the system out of memory. And since
the stack still dynamically grows, you have to make sure that you never
use more than the preallocated backing store.
Is that right?

Ah, the light dawns! This makes sense, and seems like a pretty good
solution to the problem. You can reserve memory for your program, but not
at the expense of the rest of the system!
FINALLY someone comes up with a solution to the malloc() return value
issue. And it's one that I can live with -- and entirely in user-space,
even! :-) And you don't force all tasks to use it.
It's not enough to make Linda Walsh happy, but I think it's pretty good.
Not that I would use it myself, I'm pretty happy with current behavior
(with Rik's patch) and "echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory". But I
seem to be in the minority...

I'll take your word for it.

Yes, the kludge comment was referring to the reserve for fork.
