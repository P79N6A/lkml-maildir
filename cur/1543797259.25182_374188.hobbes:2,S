The first part probably won't work too well.  The moment money is involved, 
financial pressure starts to come into play, and said person might be 
inclined to "overlook" things so to speak.  We want the second one in 
reality.  If it's supposed to work with linux, it better damn well be 
reviewed by the people that made it.
