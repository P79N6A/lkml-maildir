dear alessandro,

these patches are dated from march, so they are two months old.
do you know why they still are not in the kernel? it's not right
to try to 32bit move a segment register anyway. this should be fixed,
regardless if the majority of users does not have the latest binutils.
best regards,
herbert rosmanith
