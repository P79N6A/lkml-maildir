Subsystem maintainers cannot test each and every submission.
Sometimes due to lack of HW at other times simply due to lack of time.
Signed-off-by is exactly one thing - a way to show the path
a patch take. Then people on the path may have done more or less review/test.
Lot's of people confuses signed-of-by with acked-by btw - but this is waht this
patch should correct.
