The current process will always give up its lock instead:
---------------------------------
asmlinkage void schedule(void)
{
        struct schedule_data * sched_data;
        struct task_struct *prev, *next, *p;
        int this_cpu, c;
        if (tq_scheduler)
                goto handle_tq_scheduler;
tq_scheduler_back:
        prev = current;
        this_cpu = prev->processor;
        if (in_interrupt())
                goto scheduling_in_interrupt;
        release_kernel_lock(prev, this_cpu);
	^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
---------------------------------
Reschedule idle asks the running task to go in the runqueue in the place
of the wakenup task so there won't be any contention of the lock even if
the current task is still in the TASK_RUNNING state.
If in reschedule_idle we found that only a CPU is now running with the big
kernel lock held then we must try rescheduling only _such_ _related_ cpu
so we'll be sure to not stall in kernel locks. The current heuristic will
do the opposite.
Also it make no sense to me making difference about which is the CPU that
is running reschedule_idle. reschedule_idle now has all information about
all CPUs and can reschedule every cpu it wants, so I can't see why we are
changing the scheduling behaviour in function of the CPU that is running
the irq (or reschedule_idle in general).
-       if ((p->processor == cpu) && related(cpu_curr(cpu), p))
