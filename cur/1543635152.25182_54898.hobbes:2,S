While at it, please don't spent too much time on locking.
I reverted it to what 2.4.x (early 2.5?) kernels do and it should
work fine, remeber IDE_BUSY bit protects us from reentering
ide_do_request() (while it is set nothing will pass down this function
and REQ_STARTED request's flag protects from block layer.
Locking will be slightly changed/fixed but not now, but after fixing many
much more urgent issues...
I simply dont want to waste time on fixing locking n times.
Regards
