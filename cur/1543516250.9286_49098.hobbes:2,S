this has been my experience.......a friend of mine had problems in BeOS
till he switched the MPS (multi processor specification) to 1.4 ...... try
it out... I kept getting solid crashes in linux... I tested win2k to see
if it was just linux, but nope it wasn't.... after switching it to 1.4 its
been solid.
