you have only one card? then balancing like you say will only really
hurt you; neither linux nor the chipset will do this.

if you have multiple real interrupt sources you can balance between them
using irqbalance, see 
http://www.irqbalance.org
But note that this program will NOT move one irq across 4 cpus all the
time, since that gives *really* bad performance.
