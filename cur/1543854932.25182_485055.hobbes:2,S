ALL of my notebooks here have always been capable of Suspend-to-RAM with Linux,
and that's how I like it.  We've had six different models (IBM, Dell, Toshiba),
and they have all worked fine with S2R.
The older APM ones had zero issues, and just always worked.
The newer ACPI ones have required some tweaking to the sleep/wakeup scripts,
but now work perfectly with suspend-to-ram.
Suspend-to-disk (and resume from disk) are way too slow for regular use,
except of course for the swsusp2 version, which is nearly as quick as S2R is.
I do use S2D when travelling, as it's much easier on the batteries while
the notebook is packed away on the red-eye flights.
Cheers
