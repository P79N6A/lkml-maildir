This is a pretty major bugfix.
GFP_NOIO and GFP_NOFS callers should have been spending really large
amounts of time stuck in that sleep.
I wonder why nobody noticed this happening.  Either a) it turns out that
kswapd is doing a good job and such callers don't do direct reclaim much or
b) nobody is doing any in-depth kernel instrumentation.
Now, how _would_ one notice this problem?  We don't have very good tools,
really.  Booting with "profile=sleep" and looking at the profile data would
be one way.  Repeatedly doing sysrq-T is another.  Perhaps the new
lockstat-via-lockdep code would allow this to be observed in some fashion,
dunno.
Anyway, this patch has the potential to significantly alter the dynamics of
the VM behaviour under particular workloads.  It might turn up other
stuff...
