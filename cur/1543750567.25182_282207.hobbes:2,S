I have a similar goal -- building an operational queueing model of a
running Linux system. At this point, though, I'm not really trying to do
per-process work, just model the system overall, including processors,
I/O and virtual memory. As I noted in a recent posting, I'm currently
blocked by the incorrect statistics gathered by a 2.4 kernel in
"/proc/partitions". You can compute the throughputs, but not the average
wait and service times, or the utilizations, which depend on the service
times.
I'm rather strongly considering establishing a mailing list just devoted
to this topic -- queuing models of Linux kernels based on statistics the
kernel collects. If such a list already exists, please let me know -- I
don't want to re-invent any wheels, but there *is* a wheel I do want to
invent! Please e-mail me off-list if you know of such a list or would
join in if I create it.
Thanks,
Ed Borasky
