Subject: [RFC] Improved add_timer_randomness for __CRIS__ (instead of rdtsc())
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The cris architecture don't have any tsc, but it has a couple of
timer registers that can be used to get better than jiffie resolution.
I set the time to a 40 us resolution counter with a slight
"jump" since lower 8 bit only counts from 0 to 249,
the patch does not take wrapping of the register into account either
to save some cycles, is that a problem or a good thing?
The num is xor:d with the value from 2 timer registers,
which in turn contains different fields breifly described below.
Does the patch below look sane?
