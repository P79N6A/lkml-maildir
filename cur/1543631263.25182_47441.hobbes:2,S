I'm surprised it compiles.  I've got a rather major update to it here,
but I need to find time to pull it out of the ARM patch, and I need IDE
to settle down a bit so the two are actually in sync with each other.
(Martin messed up my DMA changes which'd prevent sl82c105 linking - I'm
waiting for the fix to emerge, which I think is in 2.5.17, but the TLB
stuff in 2.5.17 has broken all my ARM builds, so I'm unable to build or
test anything on 2.5 currently.)
Too many things to do... too many problems to solve... too many patches
to look at... too much email... not enough hours in the day... not enough
fast machines to build kernels on... not enough rmk clones to run kernel
tests... 8)
