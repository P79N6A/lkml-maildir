The closest thing I can see in the logs is a few of these:

But, this isn't unusual, its just telling me I've been moving fonts
around.  Someday, when I've got nothing better to do, I'm going to
clean house in whatever font list its using by combining them all
into one fonts dir, and then lndir that to all the other places
the various programs ordinarily look for fonts.  Frankly its a
mess, possibly partly of my own doing because for a while I actually
believed that I could just drop them into ~/fonts and they would work.
Sure, and pigs fly too...  With enough dynamite maybe.
I hope you all have a very Merry Christmas.
