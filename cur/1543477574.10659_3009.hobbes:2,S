    Well that was my first mistake as well, Nate! I think we should just let
Mr. Victor continue with his impressions of what C++ features really mean and
move on. He doesn't seem interested in learning anything about it or having his
mistakes corrected. I thought pointing out what appeared to be a simple
misunderstanding would result in less than the flurry of activity that resulted
so I'm staying out of any C/C++ topics that don't directly pertain to kernel
specific issues for now on.
