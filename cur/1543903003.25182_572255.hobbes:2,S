Thanks, I'd been meaning to do this for months :-)
Had even audited the kernel for its usage ... just didn't make or
send out a patch, sorry.

That comment in libusual is quite nonsensical, IMHO. Note that
usu_init_notify is declared as DECLARE_MUTEX_LOCKED and yet the
author wants us to believe (later, when he's doing that dummy
down();
/* nothing here */
up();
stuff at line no. 181) that the semaphore is somehow "counted" ...
Has anybody tried going through all the logic in that file? Looks totally
weird to me ... :-) Nothing in there that can't be serialized using proper
primitives.

and I guess nobody cares a whit for the #if 0'ed stuff in drivers/fc4/fc.c

Well, probably not worth much, but: Ack.
