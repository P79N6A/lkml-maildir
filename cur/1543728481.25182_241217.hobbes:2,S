The problem is that the Silicon Image controller sends unusual -- but 
legal -- block sizes to the SATA device.
Older Seagates cannot cope with this unique, but spec-correct behavior.
This issue cannot even be worked around with "nblocks % 15 == 1", as was 
previously thought.  Using that formula just makes the problem harder to 
reproduce.
Further, I don't have any plans to address the performance issue, since 
the set of affected drives is finite.

You could find out for us, and let us know :)
