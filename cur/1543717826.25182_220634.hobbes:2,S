the runtime switch would be more confortable, the config is:
ONFIG_SECURITY=y
CONFIG_SECURITY_NETWORK=y
CONFIG_SECURITY_CAPABILITIES=y
CONFIG_SECURITY_CAPABILITIES_BOOTPARAM=y
CONFIG_SECURITY_ROOTPLUG=m
CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX=y
CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX_BOOTPARAM=y
CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX_DEVELOP=y
# CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX_MLS is not set
if the runtime switch needs sysctl then probably we can stay with
disable_cap_mlock or mlock_group (I prefer disable_cap_mlock because
having more sysctl doesn't make it more secure, if you can exploit
disable_cap_mlock you can exploit hugetlbfs_group and you can exploit
mlock_group too). It's an hack and the simplest hack is
disable_cap_mlock and it is more "featured" than the group that is only
available to one group of users at once.
