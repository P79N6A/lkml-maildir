(I'm ccing miles as I think he'd like to know as well)
2 senerios  both with 2.3.43 (I had to fix the nic drivers so they would
compile, I *DID* get a few things wrong)
1) cardbus compiled in (all other cardbus/pcmcia modules)
	Keyboard still locks if mouse is used.
2) cardbus compiles as module.
	Keyboard and mouse work (that is with my specific machine)
	Network is working (see above) after cardbus and cardmgr are loaded
	Suspend machine.
	Unsuspend.
	At this point I normally hit the mouse, the system appeared to
freeze, keyboard/mouse non responsive.  Sorry, but that's as far as I went
before I turned it off.
By the way, Still some bugs with the cardbus watcher kthread.
