We didn't think it would be useful and conceptually, it is simpler to
think of one probe at an address.

It will be trivial to add this, but why? Is there a good reason
for wanting to do this (multiple kprobes at same address) as opposed 
to doing all you want done on a probe hit in a single handler?
