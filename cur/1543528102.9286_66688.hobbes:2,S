I am unable to compile 2.3.48 as is.  I get an error while compiling ad1848.c
(I have a GUS MAX).
The problem seems to be this code
    #ifdef MODULE
    static int timer_installed = -1;
    #endif
which only conditionally includes this identifier, even though it is required
elsewhere in this file and not mentioned anywhere else in the source tree.
I don't understand this code well enough to guess what the proper fix is.
