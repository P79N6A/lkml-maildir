yes, it could.
gcc supports stack protection at so called tree-level (it means
it's architecture-independent). i've just tested a simple userland-code:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
int main()
{
	char c;
	memset( &c, 0, 512 );
	return 0;
}
and stack protection works fine on {ix86,x86-64,powerpc}-linux.
i can test it on {alpha,sparc}-linux later but i'm pretty sure
it'll work too on these archs.
