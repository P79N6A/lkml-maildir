it's been tested with v2.6.20-rt8, and it should work as long as you 
enable CONFIG_RELOCATABLE. But i'm not using it myself, and 
v2.6.21-rc4-rt0 isnt a particularly encouraging version string for 
people to try ;)

what's the failure mode besides the lockdep + other debug messages - it 
doesnt resume? Your log seems to have at least one sequence of resume 
related messages - those seem to have worked fine.
