I'd rather keep the existing initialisation behaviour of using the eeprom
for 2.2. There are also some power management cases where I am not sure
the values are restored on the pcnet/pci.
For 2.2 conservatism is the key. For 2.4 by all means default to CSR12-14 and
print a warning if they dont match the eeprom value and we'll see what it
shows
