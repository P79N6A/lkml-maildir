Oh I'm sorry. I asked David and left the patch pending in the
"waiting confirmation" queue. Since he did not respond, I will merge it now.
Thanks again for having pinged me again. It's not always easy to deal with
people who don't have time to spend on 2.4 anymore, so I certainly can imagine
it's not easy on your side to wait for my responses :-/
Regards,
Willy
