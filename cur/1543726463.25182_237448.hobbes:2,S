If you look here: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/6/26/84
 you can see that this is
exactly what I was proposing minus your proposal for a more generic
class device match function. I was imagining that it would happen this way:
the framebuffer device during initialization calls lcd_find_device() and
passes his own 'struct device' to it; then lcd_find_device calls the match
function of every previously registered LCD device with this parameter. The
first one that says 'match' is returned. Same about backlight.
I don't see many reasons for a generic class match function. Last but not
least the lcd_find_device() function is very small, so it will be a negligible
gain but a lot of hassle (as you said, framebuffer drivers will have to be
rewritten to not use the simple_class device class).
