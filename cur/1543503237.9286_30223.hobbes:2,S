yep. fwiw my kernels no longer work when compiled with egcs1.x;
i know what triggers the problem, but haven't enabled the workaround
- i'd rather not take the chance something similar could be happening
somewhere else, only silently.
(as gcc2.95 produces working kernels again, i haven't investigated the
failure properly)

given the amount of dicussion about this issue, i got the impression
the strict aliasing stuff was actually a worthwhile optimization.
However after seeing what it does for the kernel case, i don't
think it's worth the effort it would take to audit/fix the code.
(this even assuming there will be a __norestrict/attribute((mayalias))
qualifier in a future gcc) Even if all current "illegal" references
are fixed/marked as such, new code (drivers/subsystems) is likely to
reintroduce some problems, which would then silently bite you.
Bottom line: -fno-strict-aliasing isn't very expensive (if at all);
when comparing gcc 2.7 vs 2.95 the code generation improvements it
triggers are in the noise. If you think -fstrict aliasing will make
your kernel noticably faster, look at the above mentioned diff
(and/or, even better, compare _your_ kernels w/ and w/o that
optimization).
otoh -fno-strict-aliasing gives you correctness guarantees that
are almost impossible to give w/ __norestrict.
