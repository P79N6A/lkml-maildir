My understanding after a quick read of the source is that "length of the
procedure" means the length, in bytes, of the function.  For most
architectures, there is not a correlation between lines of code in
assembler and number of executable bytes.
On ARM all instructions are 4 bytes long (not counting "Thumb" style
instruction encoding), but that does not mean 1 line of assembler source
code is equal to 4 bytes worth of instructions.
As far as I can tell, the "length of the procedure" is determined by the
difference between sucessive symbols found in System.map:
        .
        .
        .
        c0109414 T sys_fork
        c010943c T sys_clone
        c0109474 T sys_vfork
        c01094a0 T sys_execve
        .
        .
        .
sys_clone(), on my system, is 56 bytes long, including any alignment
padding (0xc0109474-0xc010943c = 56).

It is not a percentage.  The value is computed by:
	"load" = ticks_attributed_to_the_proc / length_of_proc
>From your example above:
	3176.9792 = 152495 / length_of_proc
therefore length_of_proc = 48 bytes.  48 looks reasonable when cross
checked with my x86 system (default_idle() is 52 bytes long on my
system).

There is no magic number.  However, from the readprofile man page, some
likely "high load" candidates could be found by:
	readprofile | sort -nr +2 | head -20
