This design still requires a global server app since the heads share a
single device.
I am always concerned that the root priv code in the X server is a
potential security hole. I would like to move away from a model where
there is a global controlling app. I don't think we need a global
controlling app at all.
By making one device per head it becomes possible to assign ownership
of the device to the specific user and let them do whatever they want
to it. It's then up to the device driver to sort everything out. fbdev
has already been designed with this in mind and I believe the Matrox
driver implements it. This model easily expands from one to N heads.
Merged-fb modes are handled by including them in the allowable modes
list on both heads. If you own both heads you can set a merged-fb mode
and the other device will just return EBUSY.
How are you reconciling the introduction of a new mode setting API
with the 90 existing fbdev drivers? We clearly don't want two
competing APIs in the kernel. What's the plan for converting all of
the existing drivers?
