Yes, AMD SMP systems already mark the TSC as unstable w/ my code.
Unfortunately in this case, we're dealing w/ a single 1Ghz PIII where
the TSC is slowing down (due to what seems to be stalls, but could be
cpufreq scaling).

If you're suggesting disabling the TSC based off of the results of the
unsynchronized_tsc() check in arch/x86-64/kerenl/time.c, I actually
already do almost the same thing (very much inspired by your code).
Although let me know if you mean something different.
