I would suggest checking the SLIT distances -- On AMD boxes, if you have three
different distances between nodes, then that system would be multiboard,
and there is no way TSCs can be synced.  On Intel boxes, if there are two
different distances between nodes, then this would be a multi board/multi
chassi box and TSCs won't be synced.  This is a more generic solution and
should work on Summit/Unisys boxes as well.  (I am ignoring Intel CSI for
now.  It might need the same treatment as AMD)
Comments?
