Why not just 'abi' ? Simpler, and allows glibc to include
just 'abi/xxxx' in other systems if they follow the same convention (BSD?) ?
Where would this live in userspace, /usr/include/abi or /usr/include/linux/abi ?
How would this relate to current /usr/include/linux 
(symlink /usr/include/linux to /usr/include/abi) ?
Just curious.
