well the feature set for both are changing rapidly.  i like the emphasis
placed on functionality over performance shown by the git developers (not
that git is slow, it's _way_ faster than bk ever was).  also the web
interface that i looked at for mecurial (admittedly four or fivve weeks
back) didn't come close to gitweb.   and the work done by jon seymour and
others on the history lineralization is just great.   it's something bk
lacked and was always a thorn in my side.

there will be a price to pay if the linux community fragments over choice
of scm.  the good news is that we're no longer locked into the whims of
some proprietary system.  so it should be straight forward for those who
choose any tool to work with those who've chosen another.  this is already
evidenced by the fact that the git repository is pulled and re-exeported
with mecurial.
anyway, all the best, just wish you guys would spend less time trying to
convert git users and more time advancing your own tool.
