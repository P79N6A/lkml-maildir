My only qualm here is that using the TSC to interpolate between timer
ticks allows for time inconsistencies. If the TSC isn't cumulatively
accurate, then when used in between ticks it will cause minor
inaccuracies and possible inconsistencies. I'd instead prefer picking a
single time source, and using NTP to correct for drift or inaccurate
calibration. 
Also breaking time subsystem from requiring regular periodic ticks
allows for tickless systems and additional power management savings. But
this should be saved for another thread.
