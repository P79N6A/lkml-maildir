Hi folks
The speedstep modules uses MSR to do its work. XEN can't allow this and
the calls needs to be done via a hypercall into xen.
I only found a hacky patch in
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.xen.devel/22282,
 which
converts one of the speedstep modules to use xen. Does someone know if
there is another solution raising?
