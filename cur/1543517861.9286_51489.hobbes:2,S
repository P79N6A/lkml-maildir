First of all, this should go to sparclinux@vger.rutgers.edu, not here.
2.3.19+ in Linus' tree has not been ported/checked for SPARC.
Wait until it is merged, or use the vger CVS, which currently has 2.3.24
SPARC tree (for sparc64, for sparc32 you'll need I think 2.3.18 from the
same CVS to get a working system).
Cheers,
