In article <19990131170959.B16021@perlsupport.com> you write:
> Ext2 handles huge files just fine.
Is this support performed through the following line in
include/linux/ext2_fs.h :
#define i_size_high     i_dir_acl
(which is rather kludgy) ? Does fsck handle it ?
By the way, does anybody know where I can find documentation on the
layout of ext2 and ufs filesystems, a5 and a6 bsd disklabels, Sun
disklabels, and Microsoft partitions (with old and new extended) ? I
look for something complete enough, so that I could write my own fdisk
and mkfs (the bsd sources are too much integrated into the bsd headers,
I think it would be cleaner to do it again from scratch -- which I
intend to do).
