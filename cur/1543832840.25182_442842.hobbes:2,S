(This is *NOT* new with 2.6.18-rc1-mm1, I've seen it a few times before, no
idea when it started... I think I've seen it as far back as 2.6.16-mm2 or so).
Most of the time, the VPN comes up just fine.

However, sometimes (usually when restarting after the VPN gets dropped due to
a network burp, etc), it will start up, get connected, and then the the first
(or one of the first) data packets over the VPN will suddenly spike the
CPU to 100% (about 50% userspace and 50% kernel).  A quick oprofile check
shows the kernel CPU getting sucked:

(pptp is the userspace control process)
gkrellm reports that about 4 mbytes/sec is being sent on ppp0 - but shows
zero traffic on eth0 (the underlying interface).  When working properly,
both ppp0 and eth0 show the traffic.
This continues until I get fed up and manually take the VPN down, at which
point it happily gets rid of ppp0 and CPU load returns to normal.
I haven't found a clean way to reproduce it - sometimes I won't see it for
2-3 weeks, then it will pop up several times in an evening.
Any suggestions/hints (besides rebuilding the implicated .ko with debugging
symbols so oprofile can be more granular - that's already on the to-do list)?
