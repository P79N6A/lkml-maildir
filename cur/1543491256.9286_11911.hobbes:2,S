That's not what he is saying. The name of the kernel is and has always
been Linux (except for in Linus's mind when he was toying with Freax or
something similar). That's the kernel. The complete operating system is
in fact generally a GNU operating system, but with a Linux kernel rather
than the GNU HURD. Nobody is saying that you should call your software
GNU/foo if you develop it with GNU tools. Nobody is saying that the Linux
kernel should be called GNU/Linux. The complete operating system, though,
is far more than just the kernel. The kernel is Linux. Most of the rest of
the operating system is GNU. It's GNU & Linux. It's a GNU/Linux operating
system. Personally I couldn't care less what you call your program,
developed with GNU tools or not, it is your right and your freedom to
choose a name for it as you see fit. But if you are ging to take a GNU
operating system and drop a Linux kernel, it should be called GNU/Linux.
If you were to replace the Linux kernel with your own called, say,
Georgix, and package it with the rest of the GNU operating system,  you
should call that GNU/Georgix, but I would be more than happy to refer to
your kernel as Georgix. The main thing is to make the distinction between
one piece of software (in this case the kernel) and the entire operating
system. There is a big difference.
