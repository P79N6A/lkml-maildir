Subject: power management and XFree86 4.01 (this has existed in X 4.0 with devel  kernels for some time)

To whom it may concern:
	I have recently tried out RedHat beta 7.0.  It reminded me, because it
installed XF86 4.01, of a bug I had forgotten to report.  This bug I believe is
in the X server or the linux kernel.  I do not know which.  It only shows up
after X has been started, and I believe only when X is running.
	I am running the glint driver and currently using 2.4.0-test7.  If I leave the
machine idle long enough for the ACPI to kick in and start shutting things down
(monitor included), the machine hangs... at least to keyboard response
(including SAK).  I do not know about network life.  I haven't tried, but I am
assuming it is since SAK fails.
	Again, Earlier XF86 works, 4.0 and 4.01 do not.  This is present with all 2.3.x
and 2.4.0-test kernels I have tried (Which are about every second up until late
2.3.5x and above, the nearly all).  I believe it is ACPI/APM related, but I
cannot say for sure.  System is a RedHat 7.0 bet or RedHat 6.2 with all updates
(6.2 until the last two or three days).
	Permedia 2
	128 Meg of Ram
	2 WDC hard drives
	Trident based 4DWave sound card (DX I believe)
	Symbios SCSI (Diamond FirePort 40 (dual))
	Permedia 2 based LeadTek Winfast 2500 w/ 8meg
	Athlon (classic) 800Mhz with FIC SD/11 I believe.
