No, I'm using an 80c cable. I have even gone out and bought a new 80c
one just to make sure the cable isn't broken. I have also got two
identical disks, and experience exactly the same problem on both.
I booted with "ide2=dma" because it was booting with the disk in pio mode.

Not tried it, but it wouldn't help me would it? I *do* have an 80c
cable, and the disk does show up in dmesg as a UDMA100 disk..
This is what happens when I thrash it, note my /home/alan is on
another non-UDMA100 disk on a separate controller.
# time cp -Rvp /home/alan/* temp
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
hde: DMA disabled
PDC202XX: Primary channel reset.
PDC202XX: Secondary channel reset.
(then lots of these)

Any ideas?
