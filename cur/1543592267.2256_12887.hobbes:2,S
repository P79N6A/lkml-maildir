Daniel, implementing transactions is not a trivial thing as you probably know. 
It requires that you resolve such issues as, what happens if the user forgets to
close the transaction, issues of lock/transaction duration, of transaction
batching, of levels of isolation, of concurrent transactions modifying global fs
metadata and some but not all of those concurrent transactions receiving a
rollback, and of permissions relating to keeping transactions open.  I would
encourage you to participate in the reiser4 design discussion we will be having
over the next 6 months, and give us your opinions.  Josh will be leading that
design effort for the ReiserFS team.
