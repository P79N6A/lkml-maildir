You could just include the latest pci.ids in your module, which wouldn't 
be any worse than relying on the kernel to have an up-to-date one. For 
that matter, if they're building the latest version of your code against 
an old kernel, the pci.ids in the old kernel is obviously going to be at 
least as old as the kernel, if not older. Most likely, the most current 
files around when someone is building your code will be your code, so, if 
it includes a pci.ids, chances are that it's the best one to use. I 
generally haven't seen the file get installed; most packages seem to just 
include a copy if they need it.

I'm actually more used to embedded systems that don't have any way of 
communicating a string to the user. Or having unexpected PCI devices 
plugged into them.
Doing stuff in the kernel instead of userspace doesn't make the system any 
more secure or reliable, either. They'd probably be better off having 
their display code use libpci, so that, if the translation screws up, some 
non-critical userspace program aborts instead of the kernel oopsing or 
panicing. You don't need a shell to use a library.
