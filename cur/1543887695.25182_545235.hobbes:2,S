-For configuration options (arch/xxx/Kconfig, and all the Kconfig files),
-somewhat different indentation is used.
-
-Help text is indented with 2 spaces.

-if CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL
-	tristate CONFIG_BOOM
-	default n
-	help
-	  Apply nitroglycerine inside the keyboard (DANGEROUS)
-	bool CONFIG_CHEER
-	depends on CONFIG_BOOM
-	default y
+For all of the Kconfig* configuration files throughout the source tree,
+the indentation is somewhat different.  Lines under a "config" definition
+are indented with one tab, while help text is indented an additional two
+spaces.  Example:
+
+config AUDIT
+	bool "Auditing support"
+	depends on NET
 	help
-	  Output nice messages when you explode
-endif
+	  Enable auditing infrastructure that can be used with another
+	  kernel subsystem, such as SELinux (which requires this for
+	  logging of avc messages output).  Does not do system-call
+	  auditing without CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL.
+
+Features that might still be considered unstable should be defined as
+dependent on "EXPERIMENTAL":
+
+config SLUB
+	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && !ARCH_USES_SLAB_PAGE_STRUCT
+	bool "SLUB (Unqueued Allocator)"
+	...
+
+while seriously dangerous features (such as write support for certain
+filesystems) should advertise this prominently in their prompt string:
+
+config ADFS_FS_RW
+	bool "ADFS write support (DANGEROUS)"
+	depends on ADFS_FS
+	...
 
-Generally, CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL should surround all options not considered
-stable. All options that are known to trash data (experimental write-
-support for file-systems, for instance) should be denoted (DANGEROUS), other
-experimental options should be denoted (EXPERIMENTAL).
+For full documentation on the configuration files, see the file
+Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt.
