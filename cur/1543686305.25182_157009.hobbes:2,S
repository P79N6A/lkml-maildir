You got it.  I've even queried Roman Zippel about moving some of the 
more simple per-driver fragments in drivers/*/Makefile into 
drivers/*/Kconfig, so that people adding drivers only have to add one 
file, and patch one file.  All of the driver-specific metadata stays in 
one place.
It would be straightforward to put the PCI IDs into Kconfig, even.  We 
already have the parser for it, so writing the tool to generate 
pci_device_id C code initializers already has the backend written.
