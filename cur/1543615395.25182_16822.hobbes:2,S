I think the right thing will be to write private symbols into config.out,
but with an attached PRIVATE label that stops configtrans.py from 
translating these into defines for the autoconf.h file.
That's what I've done for the upcoming CML 2.0.0 release.

Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there
be one, he must more approve the homage of reason, than that of
blindfolded fear.... Do not be frightened from this inquiry from any
fear of its consequences. If it ends in the belief that there is no
God, you will find incitements to virtue in the comfort and
pleasantness you feel in its exercise...
