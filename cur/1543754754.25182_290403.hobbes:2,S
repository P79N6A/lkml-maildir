The autoinstaller itself is mechanism.  When it's invoked is a policy
decision.  I described the policies that Dell employs with it in my
OLS paper last summer.  For non-distribution-provided drivers
(ppp_mppe, ALSA in some cases, 3rd party video), the autoinstaller is
enabled, and it rebuilds and installs those drivers at new kernel boot
time.
For distribution-provided drivers, we default the autoinstaller
off.  But, this has bitten us.  RHEL3 Update 2 and Update 3 both
shipped with an aacraid (boot storage) driver that crashed the kernel
on insmod.  As fate would have it, Dell provided an updated driver
source package in DKMS format to solve this.  An intelligent
autoinstaller could have looked at the version fields and determined
that what was in the "newest" Update kernel was in fact older than
what DKMS had available to it, and used that instead.  Which is why
we've been pushing for MODULE_VERSION() fields in all the drivers, and
why the srcversion field can exist for all drivers now.

It does keep track, quite well.

Ahh, but that's a policy decision to be made.  I don't have a
production example of needing to do this yet, so it doesn't.  But I
wouldn't rule out the future need for such.  (i.e. wanting to
automate upgrading a NIC driver without rebooting the server).

As it happens, right now built-in modules don't have modinfo sections,
so this piece doesn't work.  There's no way to ask the kernel for the
version of built-in modules then, it doesn't know.  But with unbind
happening, that will be useful information to have, I'll have to look
into building parts of that section in.  Thanks for pointing this
deficiency out.
Thanks,
Matt
