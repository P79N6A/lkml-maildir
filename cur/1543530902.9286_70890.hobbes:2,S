I don't have enough time for a full review of the recent changes, but at
least the comment in IPC_RMID is dangerous:
    up(&shm_ids.sem);
    /* The kernel lock prevents new attaches being happening. [...]
    */
    shm_remove_name(id)
Sounds very dangerous. The scheduler automatically releases the big kernel
lock, and if VFS sleeps on a semaphore, or if shm_unlink sleeps on
down(&shm_ids.sem), then we get a crash.
Unless VFS protects us, the following could happen:
CPU0:
    sys_shmctl(IPC_RMID);
    up(&shm_ids.sem);
    do_unlink();
CPU1:
    sys_shmget();
    down(&shm_ids.sem);
CPU0:
    shm_unlink() : calls down(&shm_ids.sem); <<<< sleeps. releases the
kernel lock.
CPU1:
    sys_shmget() returns with success.
    sys_shmat(). attaches.
and now the scheduler decides that the shm_unlink operation should continue.
crash.
And a cosmetic note: the big kernel lock is more important than the
shm_ids.sem semaphore. I would reorder
    lock_kernel();
    down(&shm_ids.sem);
to
    down(&shm_ids.sem);
    lock_kernel();
This was standard for the mmap semaphore and lock_kernel in 2.2.
Neither version will lock-up.
