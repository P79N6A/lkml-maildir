I would rather see it below the I/O layer for things like AMD64. The
reason I say this is that many drivers would suffer from iommu merging not
gain, and others may have limits.
Something like
	new_sglist = sg_squash(old_sglist, [target max segments], [max per seg])
could be used by drivers when appropriate to hand back a better sg list
(or if not possible the existing one). That would put control rather closer
to the driver.
