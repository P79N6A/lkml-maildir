Hi all,
From the mmap(2) manpage it says:
MAP_PRIVATE
Create a private copy-on-write mapping.  Stores to the region do not
affect the  original  file.   It  is  unspecified whether changes made
to the file after the mmap call are visible in the mapped region.
What is linux behaivour in this area? I am guessing if the page is
modified between the call to mmap() and fault-in then the modified copy
is seen by the application? But what about modifications after the page
is already in page-cache?
Thanks.
