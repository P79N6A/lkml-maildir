I have what sounds like a similar problem - assuming it is a problem
with the IDE layer dropping the speed - except mine is with my CD or
DVD drive. They run a lot slower under the 2.4.x kernels than under
2.2.19 (looking at 2-3megs/s under 2.4.x, 5-7megs/s under 2.2.19).
Also when using 2.4.x, the kernel has a habit of disabling DMA and
performance plummets. Yet it is fine with 2.2.19.
Is this a related issue? Is there a fix for this?
