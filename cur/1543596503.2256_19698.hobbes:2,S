Yes.

But why don't you use the bios keyword? From lilo.conf(5):
              For example,
                     disk=/dev/sda
                          bios=0x80
                     disk=/dev/hda
                          bios=0x81
              would say that your SCSI disk  is  the  first  BIOS
              disk,  and  your  (primary  master) IDE disk is the
              second BIOS disk.
