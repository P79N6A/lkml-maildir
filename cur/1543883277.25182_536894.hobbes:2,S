IOW "discouraged, no {mid,long}-term commitment, alternative available,
*un*supported"
Note, that's different from 
http://kerneltrap.org/node/7593
 --- the
supported bit is new.  Why would I officially support what I deprecate?
Also, why don't we just adopt what "deprecated" and "obsolete" mean in
real life?  (English dictionaries say, one means "disapproved", the
other means "outdated" or "no longer in use".)  And if you don't find
these meanings applicable, other terms should be chosen whose
established meaning better matches what you want to express.

That wasn't clear (to me) from your earlier definitions.
IOW "normal" -> "obsolete and deprecated, phase 1" -> "obsolete and
deprecated, phase 2"  (using the real-life meanings of the terms here)
with the fine distinction that there is still support available in phase
1, however curious that is.
Besides, I find it unfeasible to divide a feature removal process into
two phases.  (I was involved in feature removals before and continue to
be involved in them.)

At least my pestering seems to lead to increasing precision in your
wordings.  And believe me, precision in a feature removal process is
valuable for each party involved.
