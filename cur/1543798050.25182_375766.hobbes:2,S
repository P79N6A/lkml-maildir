Makes no sense to me, sorry. What 'not included' changes are you talking

Err, this change also allows to get rid of ugly stuff in write_then_read.
It also allows to keep track of memory allocation in SPI controller 
driver withough hacky tricks.
And... it's not *all* the code; if it doesn't provide such means, it's 
also fine.

I'm afraid I just can't understand what you mean by 'portable' here.

What hard-to-find bugs, I wonder?
And... I'm afraid that your core is unacceptable for us w/o the changes 
proposed.
