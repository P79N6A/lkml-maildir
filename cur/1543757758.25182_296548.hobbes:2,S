I was talking with Nigel Cunningham about doing something a little
different from the classic page flag bits when the number of users is
restricted and performance isn't ultra-critical.  Would something like
this work for you, instead of using a real page->flags bit for
PG_cached?

BTW, they're planning on using two of those dynamic flags for software
suspend, and I'll probably use at least another two in the memory
hotplug code.
