That thing's still sitting in by Inbox awaiting attention :(
I just took a quick peek.  The `testfile' file which it lays out is well
laid-out so yes, if you're seeking all over that file then 2.6.4-mm1 may
indeed help throughput.
But `tesfile.tmp' is not well laid-out.  Looks like it was created seekily,
so its blocks are all jumbled up.
The code in 2.6.4-mm1 favours unjumbled-up files.  The code in 2.4 and
2.6.4 favours jumbled-up files.
When kjournald performs writeback it favours jumbled-up files, even in
2.6.4-mm1.
So it's hard to say what will happen ;)  I'll take a look later.
