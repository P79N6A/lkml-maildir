Yes, I run with mlockall(MCL_CURRENT|MCL_FUTURE)
I can confirm this now:
I just removed my memcpy()s for testing purposes, and the app loads the
data nicely.
Pratically this means that if you enabled MCL_FUTURE,
mmap() will return only after all the mapped segment of the file resides in
memory.
Correct me please if I am wrong.

Benno.
