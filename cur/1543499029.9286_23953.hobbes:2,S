This is one basic design decision. A low-level driver implements the
Serial Bus protocol stack as in figure 3-4 of IEEE 1394-1995.
I give you some points why I did this:
* Consider new, more intelligent hardware. Hardware that does not just
  dump pre-built buffers onto the bus. Writing a driver for this new
  hardware would be _impossible_ in your subsystem. 
* I presume not all cards use the same DMA packet data format. This could
  seriously bring your subsystem in trouble.

Now on to the second issue:
Definitely not. I also don't like many things of the SCSI subsystem, but
anyway
* I just used what I need and ONLY what I need. 
* The SCSI subsystem easily allows you to have a mixture of different
  SCSI host adapters in your system. You can have two NCR and one Adaptec
  (e.g.) at the same time. The same applies to 1394. That's why I like it.
* The SCSI subsystem is stable and proven to do what it is supposed to 
  do. If it was THAT bad, why is it still in the kernel?
* It looks ugly, yes. But as soon as you understand how the SCSI subsystem
  works, you'll start to like it. (OK, I still don't like the initial
  templates, but thats a very small part).

Andreas, I am very glad you are in Linux-1394 business. But don't try to
reinvent the wheel. If your subsystem is really THAT better, I'll move my
Adaptec code to your structure ASAP. Quality wins, that's Linux
development works. But please understand that I _thought_ about what I did
and by doing everything again you'll make mistakes again I did or even
other mistakes. 
Well, I also don't know about your situation and how your effort is
organized. If you do this as a fulltime job and you are paid for it,
you'll succeed. Maybe you'll do something that's too much specialized on
TILynx, but you'll succeed. If you do this in a project which is limited
on time (similar to what I did) it's critical - You may end up with
something similar to that already done (maybe better in your opinion), but
still not finished. Then your boss wants you to do other things. If you
just do it in your spare time, you can freely decide on what you do, but
progress won't be as fast. Probably at the beginning much more, but then
development speed always decreases...
I state it again and clearly: If you succeed with your own ideas, I won't
wait any second and migrate the Adaptec code and possibly use my
experience to work on an OHCI driver. I would really like this, because
then I wouldn't be bothered with the subsystem any more. But chances are
good that you make good progress in the beginning, but at last the result
will not be very different from what I've done. I'd call this a waste of
time and work. I like Linux very much and I like the Linux-1394 project.
I want to keep the project alive in any way.
Please think about what I wrote in the beginning about the interleaving of
AIC and 1394 stuff. Be sure that you can cope with the items I mentioned.
Best regards,
Emanuel
