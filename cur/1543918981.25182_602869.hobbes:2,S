Interrupt handlers in vanilla Linux and preempt-rt are never reentrant. 
There is no advantage of allowing interrupt handler reentrancy, quite the 
contrary it makes the code more complex.
The interrupt handlers in preempt-rt are running in threads. One thread 
per interrupt, so depending on the thread priority the handlers a handler 
of one interrupt can preempt the running handler of another interrupt.

Realtime is not about throughput. It's about determinism.
