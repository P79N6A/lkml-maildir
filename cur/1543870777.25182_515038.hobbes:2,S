Well, it is not quite wrong - it is appropriate for -git.  That it will 
be replaced soon is a minor thing, as long as we can work together to 
make sure your patches are unaffected.

Believe me, I understand the complexities of dealing with -mm, -git, and 
-i386 trees.  It's not just doubly complex, its triply so.  I believe 
the best approach is to make it easiest on the maintainers.  So the 
patch stream I am uploading through -mm, -i386, to -git does not 
conflict with the Xen patch queue as long as we make sure the next 
bundle to those same trees applies clean.  Again, I broke the Xen patch 
queue in -mm, and for that I am sorry.  I will help you re-integrate 
against the VMI patches I sent out, as I broke your code, I will help 
fix it.  And we both have a tree to work off from, which makes it rather 
easy to work together ;)
Cheers,
Zach
