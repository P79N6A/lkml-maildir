And the window of vulnerability for my method is very small - for yours 
it is very large (the whole duration of the conversion operation.)
Sorry, but I've seen too many folks like you in the past on lists like 
this. You write in with a poorly considered idea, and when people try to 
show you why it won't work you plug your ears and say 
"Nyah-Nyah-Nyah-I'm-not-listening".
As I said before: if you think this is so easy to do, DO IT. SHOW US THE 
CODE.
Until you do, I consider this "discussion" at an end.
