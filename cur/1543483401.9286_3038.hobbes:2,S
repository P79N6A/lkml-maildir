	Ok, what the Workstation won't need ?
	And what the server would need ?
	At least in my case the only difference is what kind
	of display card is used, and that does not affect the
	kernel configuration a bit... (I don't use fbcon..)

	You could get it smaller by constructing packages according
	to the configuration you want, without anything else.
	However that requires feeding the configuration to some
	pre-packing engine which then selects correct bits for the
	constructed package which you could then download (in real
	time ?)
	But how do you generate that configuration, and where do
	you feed it, and what happens then ?  How does it handle
	multiple base architectures ?
	If you can answer to these questions, you propably are done
	at least the planning phase for the service.
