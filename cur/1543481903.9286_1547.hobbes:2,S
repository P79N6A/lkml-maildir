Worry after you've tried it and after about 2.2.5 if its still the case. At
absolute worse case someone can retrofit the sct vm to 2.2.5 as an optional
add on patch - but thats kind of "we know this works but not really why"

I have 8Mb machines. I expect them to be running 2.2.x well, it just may not
be 2.2.x for very low values of X.
