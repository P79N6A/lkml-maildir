i'm starting to lean towards your view that we should not artificially 
keep tasks from running, when there's a free CPU available. We should 
still keep the 'other half' of SMT scheduling: the immediate pushing of 
tasks to a related core, but this bit of 'do not run tasks on this CPU' 
dependent-sleeper logic is i think a bit fragile. Plus these days SMT 
siblings do not tend to influence each other in such a negative way as 
older P4 ones where a HT sibling would slow down the other sibling 
significantly.
plus with an increasing number of siblings (which seems like an 
inevitable thing on the hardware side), the dependent-sleeper logic 
becomes less and less scalable. We'd have to cross-check every other 
'related' CPU's current priority to decide what to run.
if then there should be a mechanism /in the hardware/ to set the 
priority of a CPU - and then the hardware could decide how to prioritize 
between siblings. Doing this in software is really hard.
