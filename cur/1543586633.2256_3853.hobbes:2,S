Sorry if I fork a bit the thread but I'm wondering why the load average is incremented for each D process.
I don't know if the kernel use this information (if yes please let me know).
But some programs like sendmail use this information to sleep when the load is too high (I believe from 12 for sendmail).
It makes sence but in the case of D process, the load average give a bad idea of the load because these process don't use CPU.
I use GFS to share a filesystem on several nodes. 
The file locking use real IO and so when you ask for a lock, if the lock is already owned, you fall in a D state.
This differs from what a local filesystem does but IMHO makes sense for a distributed filesytem like GFS.
