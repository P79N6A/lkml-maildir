I don't think it is very significant that ReiserFS version 3 is a 
journaling file system in the long term (though it did matter a lot in 
2.4), and Reiser4 is arguably not a journaling file system, but rather a 
wandering log filesystem, so I think that such a categorization is not a 
good one.  
I think that journaling is only a transitory differentiator, and only a 
differentiator vs. ext2.  It would make more sense to call ext2 "Ext2 
(obsolete, requires long waits for fsck after crashes )", and then users 
can decide for themselves who obsoleted it first.;-)
