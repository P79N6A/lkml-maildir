I think you have a valid point that as loops_per_jiffy isn't updated,
delay_pmtmr() and delay_pit() are broken w/ CPUFREQ.  
However I don't understand using the TSC for montonic_clock. I have no
clue why the HPET folks implemented it that way (likely my fault for not
enough documentaiton), but I haven't had the time to try to clean up
that code. And really, if your TSC is reliable enough for
monotonic_clock, why are you using the pmtmr? :) Unless it specifically
is resolving an issue, I'd drop that change.

Yes. Please do split out the white space, and the cpufreq changes as
well. I realize that the patch is very inter-woven, but atleast those
two changes are fairly seperable.

Its very good this is working for you! However, I'd definately like to
narrow down the specific change that causes it to work.
thanks for the strong interest and effort!
