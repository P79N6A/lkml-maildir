Humm, no comment from anyone so far.  Do you need more data? i686
(athlon) cpu, gig of ram, what else do you need? 
I could attach the .config I suppose. I did look to see if an option 
had been added to use the desktop/server versions of Cons newer 
patches, but its not visible in a make xconfig.  Is this something 
thats going to be needed, or should I switch scheduelers?
