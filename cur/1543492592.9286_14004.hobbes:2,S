Hi,
Has anyone on this list experienced a crashed X server locks up the Console
and the Display?  The machine underneath appears healthy, it does all its
tasks fine.  I would prefer not to reboot it unless have to.  I have come
across this problem a number of times over 3 years of running Linux.  
The symptoms are a frozen screen saver and a keyboard that does not respond
at all.  Even the scroll/caps lock lights do not respond.  When I check the
task list the Xserver and all the X apps have gone, the system is running
RedHat 5.1 with 2.0.36 kernel.  The machine is on an electronic
VDU/Mouse/Keyboard Switch I don't think that this is the problem since other
machines run on the same switch and they are fine.
thanks in advance for you help
If anyone is interested I am happy to get some info out of the machine if it
will help isolate the problem.  The machine has been up:
 7:21pm  up 115 days,  6:44,  5 users,  load average: 0.04, 0.03, 0.00
regards
mark
The other question I have relates to resubscribing to this list from a
different account:  the list server denies me, I think either because the IP
address of the mail server I am trying to subscribe from has been
blacklisted and the reverse DNS shows up a blacklisted domain, or maybe more
simply because the sender domain and reverse lookup domain don't match.  I
am using an ml.org domain.
What are my options?  I tried to subscribe my other address from the one I
am sending from for this, but I got a cryptic message in reply that
suggested I should know how to do it, but I don't!!
