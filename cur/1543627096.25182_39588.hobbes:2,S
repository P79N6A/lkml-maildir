Thanks for the feedback, what do you think of the following?
Could the screech possibly be caused by that tight loop where we try and 
push a command through in write_seq? Apparently its possible for a DMA 
completion to occur whilst that is happening (should the command be 
aborted?) Right at that moment a DMA completion interrupt also gets 
generated i believe, so would completing the command we were trying to 
send bork things somewhat? Am i right in thinking that we are DMAing 
garbage during that screeching noise?
Yes i am clutching at straws here ;)
As an aside, i noticed in the documentation, they specify that if dmasize 
is N we should send N to iobase+4 and not N-1 like an i8237.
Thanks,
	Zwane
