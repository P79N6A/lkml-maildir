Greetings!
We're still having hangs every two or so days with 2.2.7-ac1 -- two
486's at either end, ISA cards, 56K, Sync ppp.  Basically due to irq
timeout, followed by receiver disable in the driver.  Always cleared
by reloading the driver module.  I have an idea that the hdparm -u
done at both ends may be contributing to the problem.  Rock solid
under 2.0.34.
Take care,
