Umm.  2.4.19 _does_ build on S/390.  By getting in a truckload of patches
that update everything to IBM's latest & greatest that just require a few
unacceptable / not yet acceptable intrusive core changes you break that.
You probably don't care a lot, but people trying to test S/390 compatiblity
on Hercules (or a Multiprise in the basement..) really want to compile
kernels out-of-the-box.
