It's an annoyance to me that the current bugzilla we use can only
do 1 way email. Ie, I receive email when things change, but I can't
reply to that mail and have my comments auto-added.
Other bugzillas can do this, so I think either some switch needs
to be enabled, or theres some extension not present.
(I'm a complete bugzilla weenie, and no nothing about how its set up).

Its a nice idea, but I think it's a lot of effort to get it right,
when a human can look at the dump, realise its not decoded, and
send a request back in hardly any time at all.
I also don't trust things like this where if something goes wrong,
we could lose the bug report. People are also more likely to ping-pong
,argue or "how do I..." with a human than they are with an automated robot.
