It seems like what you want is:
	if the lock is about to be released, spin, else sleep.
But what is proposed is
	if the lock is locked as a mutex, sleep, else spin
although I doubt either of these work - they seem like attempts to avoid
designing the code.

	llseek:
		atomic_enquee request
		if no room gotta sleep
		else if trylock mutex
			return
		     else
			do work
			loop:
			     process any pending requests
			     release lock;
			     if pending_requests && !(trylock mutex) goto loop

I think it's a lot easier to propose lock structures than to work on
reducing synchronization problems.
