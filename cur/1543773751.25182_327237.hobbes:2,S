I did this with kernel 2.6.12-git2. There are more much error messages
like...
"hda: lost interrupt"
...where linux hangs with a timeout. Finally linux falls in a loop of
errors and is repeating the following tree lines continually:
hda: lost interrupt
hda: dma_timer_expiry: dmastatus == 0x64
hda: DMA interrupt recovery

Ok, is there anything that I can do?

Curious. I also have recognized that some replys did not go through the
mailing list, but I've cc'd all of you. Perhaps someone should check the
filter?
