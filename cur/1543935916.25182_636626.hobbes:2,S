Sure, I'm all for doing it the Right Way. I wasn't aware of anything
Peter was doing in this area, so lets please see it.
It's not like opportunities to improve this haven't been around. My plan
was/is to convert to using the get_block() tricks of O_DIRECT, one could
easily argue that the work should have been done then. And perhaps
direct-io.c wouldn't be such a steaming pile of crap if it had been
done, and loop would already be fine since we could have tapped into
that.
