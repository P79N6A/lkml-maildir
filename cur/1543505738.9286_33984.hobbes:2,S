Hi,
With the recent talks about printk and klogd oopses I thought
I'd post a similar message.
As usual, I was busy working on the CD-ROM drivers. After 4
hangs in a row, I decided to run it from the console to capture
the Oops.
trace: do_syslog printk get_pid schedule system_call
I can get the whole Oops on a serial console, if anyone needs
it. It triggered a "kernel BUG at sched.c:791!" - turns out
that next->active_mm != mm.
