This is to announce the new release of the ntfsprogs package (formerly
Linux-NTFS).
This is a massive update featuring an almost complete rewrite of the ntfs
library (the API should hopefully remain stable from now on) as well as
several new utilities: ntfslabel, ntfsresize, and ntfsundelete.
Note this is a beta release and can contain bugs. Please backup your data
before using any of the utilities in write mode. 
You can download the source code as a tar ball or source rpm or binary
rpms for intel 386 architecture from our website:
	
http://linux-ntfs.sourceforge.net/downloads.html
Or you can get the latest source from our bitkeeper repository by doing a:
	bk clone 
http://linux-ntfs.bkbits.net/ntfsprogs
You can also browse the source code online here:

Best regards,
	Anton
