   Here is a patch for ioctl32.c that fixes problems compiling LVM in recent
   kernels - it seems a structure member name has been changed!
   
   I would guess that this (or a similar) fix will be needed for the other 32/64
   bit platforms.
This and much more correctness fixes are in Marcelo's queue
already.  It has been fixed in my tree for a long time, so
if you're impatiant go check it out:
