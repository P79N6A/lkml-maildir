The process may have acquired resources by virtue of being suid. Consider
an executable called demo
exec("/bin/demo")
open("/etc/passwd")
/* drop root privileges using setXid/seteXid/setreXid */
then you launch the tracing process
exec("/bin/cracker")
ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH, /bin/demo's pid)
cracker can then manipulate the passwd file however it would like.
