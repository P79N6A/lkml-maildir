Actually, we don't spend that much time supporting users and the time we
do spend tells us where we need to fix the product and/or documentation.
We have a goal of zero support.  Anything less than that means the software
is counter intuitive or has some other problem.
Do you think that we'd give out BK for free if all of you were asking for
support every day?  We'd be out of business in a week.

And I'm pointing out that the logic on which that trend is based has some
severe problems.  I don't know about you, but I don't want to be part of
a business who's business model is to ship incomplete or broken software
and then charge to fix it.
