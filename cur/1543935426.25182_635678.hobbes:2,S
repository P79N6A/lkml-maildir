Can't say I like this too much .. It sounds like your telling people to
stop sending cleanup patches, which doesn't make much sense .. We want a
clean kernel .. Or at least I do ..
Linus and Andrew could slow acceptable of these patches, but I don't
think discouraging people from cleaning up code and submitting a patch
for that is the right thing to do..
(Btw, I changed to akpm@linux-foundation.org and not @osdl.org .. )
