How do you expect to ever see this in practice? Sounds basically
impossible to test for this hardware race. The obvious "try to dirty as
fast as possible on one CPU while doing an atomic get-and-clear on the
other" thing is not valid - it's in fact quite likely to get into
lock-step because of page table cache movement synchronization. And as
such it could hide any race.
