Ah sorry, that's what I get for typing before I think: of course
readv doesn't vectorise the right part of the equation.
What I really mean is a readv-like syscall, but one that also
vectorises the file offset. Maybe this is useful enough as a generic
syscall that also helps Paul's example...
Of course, I guess this all depends on whether the atomicity is an
important requirement. If not, you can obviously just do it with
multiple read syscalls...
