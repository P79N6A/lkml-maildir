The deadlock is gone. dbench 32 gives me
Throughput 1.55412 MB/sec (NB=1.94265 MB/sec  15.5412 MBit/sec)  32 procs
with 2.4.10-xfs + your patch
I will leave it this way.
Unfortunately i have a buissnes trip to South Afrika for at least 8 days 
starting tomorrow. I will not be able to do any further testing until then.
Thanks
