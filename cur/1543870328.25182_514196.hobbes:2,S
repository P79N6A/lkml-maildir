Hi,
unfortunately i yet don't really have much/enough knowledge of cfq and 
the kernels inwards at the moment...
but looking at cfq_dispatch_insert+0xb it seems the struct request 
pointer given (as second parameter by cfq_dispatch_request) was NULL 
and dereferencing it in the RQ_CFQQ macro leads to this oops.
The "break"-out patch below for __cfq_dispatch_request might be at least 
a possible workaround for this, but it could also be total bullsh.. 
Perhaps someone smarter might pick this up.. and give a real fix.
Have fun,
Frank
