Nope, you're not missing anything.  I'm just a little mixed up.  You can
find the actual "Sparse Memory" option in this patch:
http://sr71.net/patches/2.6.12/2.6.12-rc1-mhp2/broken-out/B-sparse-151-add-to-mm-Kconfig.patch
I could easily remove the references to it in the patches that I posted
RFC, but I hoped that they would get in quickly enough that it wouldn't
matter.  Also, the help option does say that all of the options probably
won't show up.  So, users shouldn't be horribly confused if they don't
see the sparsemem option.
