So you have 500 accounts, each one gets to use 1/500th of the (be very
generous!) 2Gb VM. What if a batch of 50 new accounts shows up? Everybody
gets the quota cut down 10%?
There are usually 10 active accounts, each one gets 200Mb. What if the 11th
logs in?  Start killing off processes of the people that were using exactly
their share of the memory ATM?
Resource limits per user are orthogonal to overcommit. You could very well
limit Jane Random User to 300Mb, as long as the system is able to provide
it. You can overcommit or not, but in no case can Jane use more than her
limit.
