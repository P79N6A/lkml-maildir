How does the patch below look?  I didn't want to remove the whole config
option, as there is more to the logic than just the "reverse order"
stuff there.

the removal of this pci function afterwards?

Subject: IDE: remove ide=reverse IDE core
This option is obsolete and can be removed safely.
It allows us to remove the pci_get_device_reverse() function from the
PCI core.
