Right.
Basically, the global cli/sti stuff plays games with the interrupt state
and thus potentially the counts.  At least it used to do so - I don't
think the current version does, at least not on x86, but basically it's
not something you should depend on. 
Same goes for the softirq variants (ie "bh_disable()" and "bh_enable()")
which really _do_ mess with the counts right now.
