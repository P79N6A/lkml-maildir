Linus,
	Thanks for the tip. git checkout -f did it. I dunno but I always run
it, anyway, it worked now that you mentioned it. ;-)
Additionally,
debian:~# cd linux-2.6/
debian:~/linux-2.6# git log
/usr/local/bin/git-log-script: line 4: less: command not found
Anyway! I can see how it is updated now.
Thanks!
.Alejandro
