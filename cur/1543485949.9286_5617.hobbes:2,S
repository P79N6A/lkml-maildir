Subject: Various errors in the system log -- I am running kernel 2.2.1

I am seeing two sets of errors which may be related.  I run a
home-compiled
linux 2.2.1 kernel and have glibc-2.0.111-0.990127 installed from the
rawhide RPM site.
First, I am getting errors which I think are caused by some snafu in the
automounting of the CDROM drive.

--------------------------------------------------
Second, I am seeing the following module errors:
Feb 14 21:50:33 sparky modprobe: can't locate module binfmt-0000
Feb 14 21:51:13 sparky modprobe: can't locate module binfmt-e0ff
Feb 14 21:52:53 sparky modprobe: can't locate module binfmt-af32
-----------------------------------
I am not particularly interested in running automount, since I use my
machine as a personal workstation.  I do use either dialup and a LAN
connect,
but am not using NFS or other protocols that work better with automount
running.
