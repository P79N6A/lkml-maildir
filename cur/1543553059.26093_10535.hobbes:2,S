Ingo, I will attempt this, but I doubt seriously it will allow 
Linux to defeat NetWare 5.x on LAN I/O scaling.  ALl protection 
has to go away in all LAN paths for this to happen, and user space
apps set to ring 0.  NetWare 5.cx does support ring 3 applications,
but the model is different than Linux.  I will look at a potential 
compromise between the two with the MANOS /arch merge.   It may 
allow some incarnation of Linux to smoke NetWare 5.x on LAN 
performance.  Doing this would move MARS-NWE and SAMBA into the kernel
without changing a line of code in either...
