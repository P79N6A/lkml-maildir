	In fact, all were sent to lkml... for some unknown reason, my ISP
didn't sent it (or lkml anti-spam rules filtered?). I even tried to send
a second time...

	Ok. I'll do it next time. I tried to consolidate into one due the
ammount of patches we have to send. Up now, we sent more than 250
patches, just v4l updates to 2.6.15.

	Ok. (We have also other non-i2c ir.. that's why I called it I2C_IR).
I'll prepare a patch for it. I2C_DRIVERID_INFRARED seems a good name.
