Of course...that's the only reason why it's an issue.

What are are effectively doing, then, is creating vendor lock-in based 
on file format...a very Microsoftian approach. You are encouraging 
developers to adopt your tool, but then telling them that if they ever 
want to adopt a different tool, then they will have to forego using some 
of the information that they created using your tool. So the decision of 
which tool to be used becomes based on pain of switching, and not based 
on technical merit. Hmmm.
