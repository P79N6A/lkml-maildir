Ingo and Daniel,
I'll try and make it more Linuxish. It's one of the reasons why I posted
it since I knew it would need some kind of help in that arena and I've
been in need of feedback regarding it. Originally, I picked a style that
made what I was doing extremely obvious and clear to facilitate
development which is the rationale behind it.
I'll make those changes and we can progressively pass it back and forth
to see if this passes.
