No, it's the userspace buffer.  However...
the check below isn't even reached for ext3 filesystems in
Linux 2.4.  I.e., 2.4 does not support O_DIRECT for ext3fs.
mount a partition as -t ext2 and your (modified) program
works fine.  Or use 2.6.current...
Sorry to mislead you somewhat, although you do still need
the buffer alignment fixes.
