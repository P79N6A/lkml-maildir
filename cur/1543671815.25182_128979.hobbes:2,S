Note sure what you mean with 0x90 sequence.
My original implementation used .rept to generate the correct number of 
(single byte) nops based on the label length of the other case. 
But it didn't work because I ran into at least one weird assembler bug (it internally 
got confused on something and gave an impossible error message about a
missing label). Also it only generated single byte nops.
In any case you need to pad the code to the correct number of bytes,
I'm not sure how it can be done otherwise.
