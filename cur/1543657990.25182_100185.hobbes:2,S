These two are questionable. I do not know what DaveM will need, but
I'll be happier with character coordinates for text mode. So for me it is
just question whether I'll do divide by width/height stored from setfont
in text mode, or multiply when in graphics mode. So I must remember
character cell size in any case. But having multiply in matroxfb could 
save multiply here in generic code.
I have strong feeling that doing multiply in generic code, and then divide
in fbdev driver is waste of time, but if Dave is happier with pixel
coordinates, I can definitely live with it.

It would be nice to have old accel_putcs() available for modules, so driver 
could decide on case-by-case basis whether it will use its own code or 
generic without touching pointer (without modifying potentially constant
fb_ops structure common to all fbdev instances).
