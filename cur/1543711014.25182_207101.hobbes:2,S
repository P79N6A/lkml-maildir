Hi,
The low end of the market is dominated by the SII3112 chipset, so I'm 
looking for an alternative 4-port JBOD SATA controller and came across 
the High Point card.
How is the support of these cards from libata and/or drivers/ide in 2.6?
Alternatively, are there any 4-port (alternatively I can use two 2-port 
SATA controllers) JBOD SATA PCI cards with good support in the 2.6 
kernel (or with patches) in the ~$50 US price range?
Mike
