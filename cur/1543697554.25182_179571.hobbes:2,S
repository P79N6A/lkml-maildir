Please try CONFIG_NR_CPUS=8, or apply the patch below to 2.4.23.
smp_boot_cpus() incorrectly assumes that Local APIC ID's are handed out
0,1,2...
But they're handed out 0,1,6,7 on your system.  #6 happens to be your
boot CPU, smp_boot_cpus() brings up #0 and #1, and never asks to boot #7
-- thus 3 logical processors.  If #0 happened to be your boot processor,
you'd get only 2 logical processors.
cheers,
