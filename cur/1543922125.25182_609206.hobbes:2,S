This true iff the protocol that this mythical network file
system uses the name of the file on the server to actually
identify the file on the server.
Clearly, this is broken on many levels.  It can't handle
situations as described nor can it handle different instances
of the same filename being used.
This is why NFS, a network file system, does not use the filename
as part of the file handle.
Wouldn't you be better off by attempting to implement an "open
by ino" operation and an operation to get the generation count
for the file and then modifying the network protocol of interest
to use these as identifiers for the file to be manipulated?
I agree with Christoph on this one.  It is the wrong path.
