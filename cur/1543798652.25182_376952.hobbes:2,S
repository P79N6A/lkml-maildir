Hmm, that's true. In that case it's probably best to wait until the
first wave of patches out of -mm have hit the git tree and then I
recreate the patch from our internal tree. The current patch dependecies
are starting to make my head ache.

Older versions of the code had an own registration function for a
callback pointer for the events. It only accepted one user and sort of
reinvented the notify functionality. I'd prefer notifiers compare to the
old solution. If you have a clever idea, we are listening.
On a side not, Arnd just told my about the bug in the dasd_eckd
discipline. We need to check the discipline in the eckd specific ioctls.
I'll tell the appropriate people (well in fact I already did because
they are on CC:). As for adding a per discipline .ioctl function, that
won't work because of cmb and eer. These modules do not implement a
discipline but still have to add ioctls.
