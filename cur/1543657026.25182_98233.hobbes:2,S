when I try to boot 2.5.53 with the 6.2.24 'new' aic7xxx driver I get an
error message
aic 7xxx PCI Device 0:10:0 failed memory mapped test useing PIO
and then the initial information block about the card, then nothing, it
never finishes downloading the firmware or detects the drives.
I am sucessfully useing 2.4.18 on this box, but have been unable to use
any of the recent 2.5 kernels, prior to .53 they were not detecting any of
the disks.
