Have you never wanted to improve any aspect of the software in your
cell phone?  In your TV, VCR, DVD player, anything?  In the microwave
oven, maybe?

I was not talking about installing another OS, I was talking about
making changes to the OS.  As in, improving one particular driver,
avoiding a blue screen, stuff like that.

Sure.  Such that I can watch shows while wasting time in public
transportation, in an airplane, whatever.

And the fact that TiVO can be, and has been modified remotely to add
restrictions on what users could do, means nothing you do with it is
safe.  You, and everything you've recorded with the TiVO, are at the
mercy of this one company.

What would their consuming GPL software buy us, if they won't respect
users' freedoms, which is the very reason behind the GPL?
Heck, if they don't want to play by the rules, that's up to them.  But
then they shouldn't use the software at all.
Yeah, I wish they'd rather play by the rules, but if they don't want
to, too bad, for us and for them.

Don't worry about parrotting here, he hasn't provided that explanation
yet ;-)  Please give it a try.
BTW, what license is Linux licensed under?  It's GPLv2 plus userland
exception, right?  (There's some additional module exception, right?)

Have you ever wondered *why* he doesn't like them?
Could it possibly be because they harm the goal of his life, which is
to enable people to live their digital lives in freedom?

No, no, you got it wrong.  Linux is the kernel.  GNU was the
nearly-complete operating system it fit in.  GNU+Linux is a complete
operating system.
And you don't have to believe me, believe Linus, the initial author of
Linux:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/Historic/old-versions/RELNOTES-0.01
  Although linux is a complete kernel
  Sadly, a kernel by itself gets you nowhere. To get a working system
  you need a shell, compilers, a library etc. These are separate parts
  and may be under a stricter (or even looser) copyright. Most of the
  tools used with linux are GNU software and are under the GNU
  copyleft.

Err...  Last I looked it was a bunch of general-purpose components,
packaged in a way that made it not look like a general-purpose
computer.  Who gets to decide?  And with what motivations?

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
  of it

So does the GPLv3.  It might be a bit narrower, to cut on other kinds
of abuses, but all constraints I'm aware of that are mandated by law
can still be achieved.  The point is to forbid disrespecting users'
freedoms to modify the software.  Configuration parameters for the
hardware, needed to comply with regulations, can be easily taken care
of without disrespecting users' freedoms.
