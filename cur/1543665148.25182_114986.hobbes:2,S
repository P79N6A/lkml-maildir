It should be possible to use the same approach that the other latency
testers use (ie contest&co), by just generating some specific background
load (say, different mixtures of X clients and plain compute-bound things 
like kernel compiles).
Ie measure directly exactly what we're interested in: the latency of some
general X request, under different loads.
