Could you fix up the mimetype, please?  It makes it hard for various email

Preferred coding style is actually
	for (i = 0; i < IPMI_MAX_CHANNELS; i++)
but we've kinda lost that fight in drivers :(

Are these all OK wrt compat handling?

Be aware that this function will use more stack space than it needs to: gcc
will create a separate stack slot for all the above locals.
Hence it would be better to declare them all at the start of the function. 
Faster, too - less dcache footprint.
Maybe not as nice from a purist point of view, but it does allow you to
lose those braces in the switch statement...
