Greetings,
I would like to thank Stephen, Laslo and Andreas for
the links and info about e2compr, but I already knew
about the patch.  If I understand the patch correcly,
it works by setting a permission bit to determine if a
file is to be compressed, and if the file is a
directory, then all new files are compressed (if I'm
wrong, let me know).  My intention is to mount a
filesystem where everything is compressed, except for
the files already compressed.  An example would be a
directory or file move and having it already
compressed without having to set additional bits or
remembering to set the compression bit each time I
mount a disk.  I'm not sure if that helps any.
Ciao
