The GPL enforced the view on free software, the BSD license does not.
The BSD license lets you do whatever you want pretty much.
If you want to make money from linux, you can do so by being better than
other people at solving problems and making enhancements.  With BSD all
it takes is keeping secrets.  So if you are very good at what you do,
you will be perfectly happy dealing with GPL code and making money
writing enhancements for people, while if you aren't very good, you
could just go write some software using BSD licensed code and sell that,
preferably taking out a software patent while you are at it to prevent
someone else from writing another implementation.
