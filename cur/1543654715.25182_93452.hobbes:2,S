linux-net@vger.kernel.org would be a more appropriate mailing list..

what are your sysctl settings, especially your buffer sizes? Increasing 
your default tcp buffer size is the single most useful thing you can do
to improve performance if your app doesnt set buffer sizes using 
setsockopt (and I dont believe it does). does it use TCP_NODELAY?  are
you using ipsec?
are you sure you have path mtu turned on? is fragmentation occuring?
netstat -s would show you the snmp and tcp extended stats - that would
be the first place to look for problems..

a tcpdump trace would be the next thing to look at - that should tell you
whats happening (although perhaps not why :))
