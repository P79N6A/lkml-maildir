I have done just that! (and ages (10 minutes) before I read your email).
Of course it would work and it saves us to free it in mount_root(). This
data is available in unparsed form in saved_comman_line[] of course, but
that is irrelevant for the present purpose. Have a look at this (tested)
patch:
http://www.ocston.org/~tigran/patches/rootfs-2.3.29-p1.patch
if I hear no objections it will be sent to Linus soon.
regards,
Tigran.
