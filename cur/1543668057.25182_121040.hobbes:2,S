You must have overlooked some of my questions:
How are these disks registered and how will the dev_t number look like?
How will the user know about these numbers?
Who creates these device entries (user or daemon)?

SCSI has multiple majors, disks 0-15 are at major 8, disks 16-31 are at 
65, ...., disks 112-127 are at major 71. Will this stay the same? Where 
are the disk 128-xxx?
Can I have now more than 15 partitions?
bye, Roman
