I can see the reasoning where the device just doesn't function properly 
with DMA at all (like on some Compact Flash-to-IDE adapters where the 
card claims to support DMA but the DMA lines aren't wired through in the 
adapter properly). In that case not disabling DMA would render it 
useless. The IDE layer could keep track of whether DMA was previously 
working on that device however, and not disable DMA on reset if it had 
previously been working.
