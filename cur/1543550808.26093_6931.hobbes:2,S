Firstly, I just spent 2 months trying to get the sd module
name reverted to "sd_mod.o" as it is in lk 2.2 and 2.0 .Now 
this patch seems to rename the sg module to "sg_mod.o"! 
Since the vast majority of distributions build sg as a module,
there could be a lot of irate SANE and cdrecord users out
there. Also devfsd and other module loading software would 
need to be changed. Hopefully this is an oversight.
Secondly, do we really need the scsi Makefile and directory
structure changed this close to the lk 2.4 release?
What does it gain us? Could changes of this dimension be
sent to Eric Youngdale or at least the linux-scsi list
rather than just sent to the linux-kernel list?
