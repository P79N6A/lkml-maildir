The implementation of "printk" does funky stuff like this so I'm assuming it's
sort of acceptable.
Some of those function bypass latency tracing and preemption violation checks.
Don't see a reason why you should be touching those functions unless you're
going to modify implementation of spinlocks directly. Just use
spinlock_t/raw_spinlock_t to take advantage of the type parametrics in Ingo's
spinlock code to determine which lock you're using and you should be fine.
