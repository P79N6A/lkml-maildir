I'm aware of it, but until someone actually produces a multicore which 
executes the same instruction set (386+P4?) I assume that all the cores 
used by the program will be the same.
I wrote for the DEC Rainbow (8086 and Z80, one did disk and video, one 
did serial+net), and IIRC the memory addresses were shared but the IO 
addresses weren't. Also something I can't easily name which had a 68010 
and 4 bit RISC in a single carrier. Early microcomputer days were fun, 
or at least I thought it was fun to cope with bizarre and unreliable 
hardware when I was young.
