You were just flaming? I'd heard that you provided suggestions.
PC Week will be running this. I don't look forward to reports of Linux
people wimping out. I see only two weak excuses left, the Ami MegaRAID
card and unassisted Apache server.
It is stupid to simply refuse, and perhaps stupid to simply accept.
The only safe option is to create a list of demands that would make
the benchmark acceptable.

That is quite silly. Consider these demands:
1. No more joint press release. They do theirs, we do a few dozen.
2. Zeus web server and/or (?) reverse squid proxy
3. Mylex or ICP-Vortex instead of Ami MegaRAID
Would that be enough for you? How about if VA Research Linux Solutions
was allowed to substitute an equal-cost Linux server? (good PR for them)
