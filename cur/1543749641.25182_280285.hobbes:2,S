The conservative line is to keep a consistent definition of the interface
following posix as closely as possible. The definition of the 4 clockids
CLOCK_*_CPUTIME_ID, CLOCK_REALTIME and CLOCK_MONOTONIC should stay
constant and be implemented in a consistent way by the kernel. That is
the case now and should not be changed by any future patches.
