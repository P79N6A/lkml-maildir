It would be easy work to add CLONE_PPID/CLONE_PARENT. There was a more
complex patch floating around on l-k too that added three bits for this
case too, but it always looked like overkill for me. 
Do you have any specific application in mind ? It was originally done for
gdb threads debugging [Randy Chapman's Microsoft gdb patch did use 
a similar hack], but that got obsolete with the OSF gdb changes that
used a different way.
