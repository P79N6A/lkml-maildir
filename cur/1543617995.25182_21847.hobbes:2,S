Agreed.  Conversely, however, writing code that introduces long
interrupt-off periods should be considered a BUG.
In other words, relying on short interrupt-off periods is bad form, but
so is writing gross code that rudely keeps them off.
I think we all considered the long off periods in VT switching and fbdev
a bug.
