Nice exposition and analysis, but see my wet-blanket comments below...

It's a conscious goal to try to unify all sources of memory.  The three
zones that are there now are only there because they absolutely have to be.

It becomes effectively useless.  The probability of all 8 pages of a given
8 page unit being free when only 1% of memory is free is (1/100)**8 =
1/(10**16).

Moving pages sounds scary.  We already know how to evict pages, but moving
pages is a whole new mechanism.  We probably would not care about the "good"
data lost through eviction as opposed to moving fraction of pages we'd have
to evict to do the required defragmentation is tiny.

I'm going to confess that I don't understand your solution in detail yet,
however, I can see this complaint coming: the changes are too intrusive on
the existing kernel, and if that's what we had to do it would probably be
easier to just eliminate all high order allocations from the kernel.  I
already have heard some sentiment that the 0 order allocation failure
problems do not have to be solved, that they are really the fault of those
coders that used the feature in the first place.  I don't know about that,
I'd like to hear from the maintainers.  But I'm pretty sure that whatever
solution we come up with, it has to be very simple in implementation, and
have roughly zero impact on the rest of the kernel.
