Now I have an "ip" that knows about metric but... :-)
  It seems metric is used as part of the key used to identify the
route. Is that right?
  e.g.:
	# ip route
	...
	default dev eth1
	# ip route replace default dev eth1 metric 1
	# ip route
	...
	default dev eth1
	default dev eth1 metric 1
  I was sort of hoping it would just change the metric since the
destination, device, gateway etc. all matched :-(.
