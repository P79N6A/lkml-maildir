The real problem, though, is that the high priority thread only needs
a total of a few percent worth of CPU time. The behaviour which I'm
reporting as a potential bug is that this process which needs very
little CPU time is effectively getting an entire CPU to itself,
despite the fact that other CPU-bound threads could benefit from
having time on that CPU.
One could argue that a thread with a high enough priority *should* get
a CPU all to itself even if it won't use that CPU- but that isn't the
behaviour I want. If this is in fact the intended effect of having a
high-priority thread wake very frequently, I should start a different
discussion about how to solve my specific problem without the use of
elevated priorities :)
I don't have any reason to believe, though, that this behaviour was
intentional. I just finished my "git bisect" run, and I found the
first commit after which I can reproduce the problem:
c9819f4593e8d052b41a89f47140f5c5e7e30582 is first bad commit

    [PATCH] sched: use softirq for load balancing
    Call rebalance_tick (renamed to run_rebalance_domains) from a newly introduced
    softirq.
    We calculate the earliest time for each layer of sched domains to be rescanned
    (this is the rescan time for idle) and use the earliest of those to schedule
    the softirq via a new field "next_balance" added to struct rq.

Thanks! I've also CC'ed Christoph.
For reference, the exact test I used with git-bisect is attached. The
C program (priosched) starts two busy-looping threads and a
high-priority high-frequency thread which uses relatively little
CPU. The Python program repeatedly starts the C program, runs it for a
half second, and measures the resulting imbalance in CPU usage. On
kernels prior to the above commit, this reports values within about
10% of 1.0. On later kernels, it crashes within a couple iterations
due to a divide-by-zero error :)
Thanks again,

/*
 * This is a demonstration of unwanted SMP scheduler side-effects
 * caused by high-priority threads.
 *
 * In this demo, we have three threads:
 *
 *   1. A busy-loop (CPU bound) at nice level 0.
 *
 *   2. Another busy-loop at nice level 0.
 *
 *   3. A high-priority thread (nice -10) which spends
 *      most of its time sleeping, but it wakes up
 *      frequently and spends a little bit of CPU each time.
 *
 * This is meant to model three of our threads in the vmware-vmx: a
 * VCPU thread, the MKS thread, and the main VMX thread. Ideally, the
 * VCPU and MKS would spend most of their time running on separate
 * CPUs on an SMP system. The VMX thread would wake up frequently,
 * interrupt an arbitrary cpu-bound thread, then go back to sleep.
 *
 * The actual behaviour I see on Linux 2.6 is that the system
 * oscillates between two states, with a period of a few seconds. In
 * the "good" state, the two busy-loop threads run on separate CPU. In
 * the "bad" state, both of the busy-loop threads run on the same
 * physical CPU and the other CPU sits idle.
 *
 * Taking a closer look at the kernel's scheduler debug output
 * (/proc/sched_debug and /proc/schedstat) the problem becomes
 * clearer: Even though the VMX thread spends very little time
 * running, its runtime is given extra weight according to its
 * priority. The "load" calculated by the scheduler for its CPU is
 * low, but the load average calculated via delta_exec and delta_fair
 * can become quite high. The result is that the physical CPU where
 * the VMX was running gets stuck with a high load average even after
 * the VMX thread is sleeping again. This high load average causes all
 * running tasks to be rebalanced onto the other CPU until the high
 * load subsides.
 *
 * This example requires a machine with exactly 2 CPUs.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   cc -o priosched priosched.c -lpthread
 *   sudo ./priosched
 *
 * Now observe the load on both CPUs. In the "good" state, both CPUs
 * will be busy. In the "bad" state, both of the busyThreads will be
 * stuck on the same CPU and the other CPU will be idle. 
 *
 * If you have a kernel with scheduler debugging compiled in, try "cat
 * /proc/sched_debug". In the "bad" state, one CPU will have an empty
 * runnable task list and a list of cpu_load[] averages around 9000.
