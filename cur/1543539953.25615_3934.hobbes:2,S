I _am_.
I agree with the CAP_SYS_RAWIO thing. Obviously. I think the current code
checks CAP_SYS_ADMIN, which is almost certainly just due to the fact that
that is what most of the old "super_user()" tests were changed into.
But you haven't followed the discussion: I disagree about the kernel
trying to parse the damn commands, because I don't think that the kernel
can (or should) know about all vendor-specific commands and whether they
are "evil" or not.
If somebody sends me a patch to change CAP_SYS_ADMIN into CAP_SYS_RAWIO,
I'll apply it in a jiffy.
