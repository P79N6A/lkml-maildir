At what stage?  If it's initramfs, then don't have one on initramfs.  (Not by 
default anyway, add a symlink when you're ready to start caring, or write the 
correct path to /proc/sys/heeeeeeere's_hotplog.)
Failure to exec 1000 times shouldn't take too long.  I have shell scripts that 
fork and exec 1000 times in under a second, and they're actually doing 
something.
