Interesting problem.....  Interesting because I'm having the EXACT

(pause)
.... well, almost.  Mine doesn't reboot, it just hangs at the exact
same point where yours reboots on ANY kernel 2.4.0 and later.
The closest thing I found was a reply to a post from 1999 where a person
was having the kernel (or boot loader?) hang right before it uncompresses.
The reply was:

Have you tried building for a generic i386 target processor?

Well, if it didn't work the first time....   :)

I'm inclined to think none of this ha anything to do with it, because
the kernel in which all of these items reside is never booting up...
My problem persisted despite my building a buck-naked 2.4.18 kernel.
It had no ANYTHING in it (not even module support) and was just 250K.
The results were the same.
I'm betting on a problem with the boot loader or bios incompatibility.
My machine has a PhoenixBios (4.06 I think-- I'll check tomorrow).
What does your machine have?
