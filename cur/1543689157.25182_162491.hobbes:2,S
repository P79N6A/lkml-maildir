If interrupts work with acpi=off, but otherwise don't, then:
--begin quote--
Please file a bug at 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/
Category: Power Management
Componenet: ACPI
Please attach the output from dmidecide, available in /usr/sbin/, or
here: 
http://www.nongnu.org/dmidecode/
Please attach the output from acpidmp, available in /usr/sbin/, or in
here
http://www.intel.com/technology/iapc/acpi/downloads/pmtools-20010730.tar
.gz
Please attach /proc/interrupts and the dmesg output showing the failure,
if possible.
--end quote--
This answer is the same no matter who built the system.
Thanks,
-Len
Ps. Needless to say, this is a hot issue and has become hotter as more
people are enabling ACPI.   There are a number of bugs open on this
topic already with fixes in the works -- so check for dupes.
