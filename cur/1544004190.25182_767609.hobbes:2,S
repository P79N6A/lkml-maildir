I love -tip testing :-)

Ok. Let's change into function_full, after all, I think that this tool
will be mostly used  with a parsing pass
of its traces with a script to produce statistics and hierarchical
representation like does draw_functrace.py
After that, the order of apparition of the functions in the trace will
not really matter.
