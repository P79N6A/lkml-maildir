  Fixed. Thanks for not stopping on the first parse error ;-)

   I assume by "platform" you mean CPU architecture. So, well... It
indeed must be very flexible, scalable, maintainable, and completely
not error-prone to let each platform reimplement wheel in its own
special way. For example, say, ASIC3 appears in both PXA and S3Cxxx
devices. Suppose driver which uses ASIC3 works well on PXA, but acts up
on S3Cxxx. Reason? Just because PXA uses "IDR" for its "gpio_to_yyy",
while S3Cxxx uses "whatever".
   But here's a point which made me to cleanup patches and resubmit
them again, and continue this discussion (because I really don't feel
like fighting against the tide) - I read "Re: Any possible to split
the pxa-regs.h?" thread, and see some fresh trend in it. So, let me
continue this and ask: how GPIO handling relates to CPU architecture
at all (and that's what I assume you mean by "platform")? The answer:
it does not.
   We for long time took for granted that the whole system world spins
around plastic package with label "CPU". Apparently, that's wrong, it
spins only around the CPU core which happens to be in that plastic.
Anything else in that plastic is just that - external devices. So sorry,
why do we need to define external device access in terms of what CPU
controls them? Maybe it makes sense to define that access just in the same
way as for any other external device - using a driver and a framework
a driver should follow? (And yes, plain vanilla LDM is not enough here,
a minuscule extension needs to be applied.)

  Why first N could be inlined? What if I need second N inlined?
Here, PXA GPIOs have really low-frequency stuff, while ASIC3 does
bitbanging, so that's what should be inlined. And on system X, GPIO
chips #1, #3, #4, #7 needs to be inlined, while the rest could be not.
  So, why don't we handle this in following way: have two different
levels of API: one which is concerned with inlinability (as noone
disagrees this is important feature), and another - with generality
and extensibility? That's why gpiodev API proposed to be on top of
gpio API.

  Yes, that's true. There're always some choices and compromises
among different requirements, but I and other handhelds.org developers
argue that the proposed "gpiodev" is more scalable.

  This is not correct presentation. Comparing your per-contoller
struct's with my per-gpio structs are comparing apples and oranges.
GPIODEV just uses structured id's instead of scalar, that's all.
And they have it because that allows to automagically solve many
issues your approach outlined above solves "manually".
> since that's not only less expensive but
  In GPIO API, GPIO id's are integers, 4 bytes on 32bit platform,
passed by value. In GPIODEV API, GPIO id's are fixed-size structures,
8 bytes, passed by reference, 4 bytes, so the same overhead.
  In GPIODEV API, to execute operation, you take one member of ID,
treat that as structure, take pointer from it, and call function by
that pointer, passing second member as is.
  With your approach above, you do lookups or even expensive linear
searches just to get idea of what code should process the operation,
then offset gpio id by some value before passing it to that code.
  Sorry, but what's less expensive here?
> it's also a direct match to what the underlying code needs.
  Apparently just the opposite - GPIODEV's data structures have what
the underlying code needs right away, while you need to do some magic
on it.
  So, the code you propose goes to strange, and as was shown,
superfluous things like first requiring adding some value to gpio#,
then looping/looking up value to subtract from it, etc., etc. Why?
There doesn't seem to be any technical reason for that. The reason it
seems to be doing that is paradigmatic: to pretend that the world is
flat, and that GPIO's stick not out of specific chips, but out of the
whole system, all lined up in a row. Proposal: let's leave such outlook
behind, accept that world is 3D, and have bunch of problems solved for
us automagically (and what's not less important, such new outlook can
be reused for few other problems too).

  Wonderful. It only means that patches for generic GPIODEV interface
can be done a bit later ;-).

  I of course have no intention to delay already existing patches, or
anything. I'd be glad if there was any runtime-extensible GPIO API at
all. I just happen to get a feeling that there can be gained momentum
to resolve some issues of ARM Linux (and few of Linux at all), so just
hope that discussion and proposed implementation can be found useful.
