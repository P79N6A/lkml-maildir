1. yes it recovers after about 20 seconds of machine stall, then does it 
again in a minute or two (using cdroms), or many minutes elsewise.
2. haven't had a chance to try with acpi=off, turning off acpi broke 
things for me a while back
3. haven't tested 2.4 (it didn't do this several kernels back), don't 
have any other operating systems
It's also worth noting that this timeout is severely aggravated by using 
my DVD and CD drives on hdc and hdd respectively.
