The problem I am trying to solve is the userspace PCI access methods 
accessing my config space when the adapter is not able to handle such an 
access. Today these accesses bypass the device driver altogether and 
there is no way to stop them. An alternative to this patch would be to 
only do these checks for the PCI config accesses initiated from the 
various userspace mechanisms, but I'm not sure the patch would then be 
usable for what benh wanted it for. Ben?
