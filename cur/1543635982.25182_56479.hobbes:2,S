One more thing - can I just make the comment that testing freshly formatted filesystems is not going to show up ext2's real weaknesses, that happen to old filesystems - particularly those where the filesystem has been allowed to fill up.
I timed *15 minutes* for a system I admin to unlink a single 1G file on a fairly old ext2 filesystem the other day (perhaps ext3 would have improved this, I'm not sure).  It took 30 minutes to scan a snort log directory log on ext2, but less than 2 minutes on reiser - and only 3 seconds once it was in the buffercache.
You are testing for a mail server - how many mailboxes are in your spool directory for the tests?  Try it with about five to ten thousand mailboxes and see how your results vary.
