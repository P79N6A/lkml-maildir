Right.  Add the option.  Default to "spew mode",
but make it easy for distributions to show people
a non-threatening boot process.  
Anyone who thinks that there aren't lots of people 
who simply freeze in terror at the thought of having
to understand and tweak their computers obviously
needs to spend more time socializing with non-gearheads.
For example, everytime I have tried to explain anything
to my mother-in-law about her computer, I might as well
be speaking Mongolian.  She gets confused if someone 
rearranges her desktop icons.  
Since, as Christophe mentions, the boot messages would
still be accessible via CTRL-ALT-F2, I don't see what 
the problem is with at least making this an option.
