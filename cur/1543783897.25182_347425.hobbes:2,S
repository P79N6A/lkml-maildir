-git5 has additional breakage:
	* s390 crypto is b0rken; removal of workqueue that doesn't exist
	* ppc44x missed s/u3/pm_message_t/
	* sparc64 Kconfig changes need to be compensated for in drivers/char
Plus m68k and uml stuff need updates.
I'll post the updated patchset in a few and start clean rebuild; then the
logs will go.
