Correct.
For msi-x, the driver does three disable_irq() calls to the correct 
vectors. ugly, but nevertheless correct.
The bug only affected msi: The driver did disable_irq(<old INTx irq 
num>) instead of disable_irq(<new msi-x irq num>).
The patch that I've attached to the bugzilla report 9047 seems to fix 
the crash, thus I would propose to apply it to 2.6.23 and 2.6.24. I'll 
send a seperate mail.
All other problem [reduce code duplication, less ugly locking, ...] 
should be fixed with independant patches.
