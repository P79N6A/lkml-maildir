Since there is always at least one freeable page in the system (or we're oom) then
we just have to find it and we know we can forcibly unmap it.  We do need to know
the total of pinned pages, I should have said locked/dirty/pinned.
Since GFP_KERNEL includes __GFP_WAIT, we are even allowed to wait for dirty page
writeout.
