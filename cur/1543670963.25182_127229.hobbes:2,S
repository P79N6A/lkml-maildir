| 1. How to set ES to this area? "movw $0xf000, %ax ; movw %ax, %es" will be 
| enough?
That should do it.
| 2. Is the are really starts from 0xf000? Or 0xe000?
Most current ones that I know of are 128 KB, so start at segment 0xe000:0
thru 0xf000:ffff.
Just boot DOS, run debug, and display those areas.  That will answer
it for you.  :)
| 3. I'm smart enough to correct "incb %bx" to "incw %bx" ;)
