Until you go to gcc 2.96 when the prologue code changes dramatically.
Interleaved instructions, plus "nice" constructs like
void foo(int bar)
{
	if (!bar)
		return;
	....
	return;
}
Could generate the test before doing anything on stack.
foo: cmpl  4(%esp),$0
     be    1f
     pushl %ebp
     movl  %esp,%ebp
     ...
     movl  %ebp,%esp
     popl  %ebp
1:   ret
