The reason we need to enforce the 400nS delay is because of what is 
going on on the other processor.  If the other processor is in ide_intr 
trying to grab the spinlock and we do not give the drive time to assert 
the busy bit and the other processor makes it to the call to 
drive_is_ready, then the drive could still return not busy and we could 
think the command is done.  This code path is probably less than 50 
instructions, so I don't think it's taken anywhere near 400ns for a long 
time.
DMA is slightly different.  We don't actually have to delay the 400ns if 
we call ide_dma_begin from inside the spinlock.
