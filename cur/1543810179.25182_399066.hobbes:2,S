So taking example with IPC, you propose the following:
- parent is able to setup limits on segments, sizes, messages etc.
- parent doesn't see child objects itself, i.e. it is unable to share 
segments with a child, send messages to child etc.
Am I correct?
Provided I got it correctly, how does this differ from the situation, 
when one container is granted rights to manage another container?
So where is hierarchy?
Moreover, granting/revoking rights is more fine grained I suppose. And 
it is more secure, since uses the model - allow only things which are 
safe, while heirarchy uses model "allow everything" to do with a child 
and leads to possible DoS.

Again, how does this differ from the situation when one container is 
granted to manage another one? In this case it grant some portion of 
it's resources to anyone he wishes.
Take a look at this from another angle:
You have a child container, which was granted 1/2 of your resources.
But since parent consumed 3/4 of it, child will never be able to get his 
1/2 portion. And child will be unable to find out the reason for 
resources allocation denies.

If you are talking about management, then see my prev paragraph. Rights 
can be granted. Can you provide some other example, what do you want 
from hierarchy?

it is tightly interconnected with unix sockets, proc, sysfs, ipc, and 
I'm sure something else :)
Herber, Eric, I'm not against namespaces. Actualy OpenVZ doesn't care 
whether we have single container or namespaces, I'm just trying to show 
you, that all of them are not that separate namespaces as you are trying 
to think of them.

only if we remove all these pid uses from fown, netlinks etc.

which one? give me an example please.

it needs virtualization, really. But being virtualized they are still 
tied to the subsystems they were.

So if you have a socket in TCP_FIN_WAIT1 state, which can live long 
time, what do you do with it?
Full example: the process dies, but network space is still alive due to 
such a socket. You won't be able to reuse the address:port until it died.
I'm curios about how do you propose to handle similar issues in separate 
namespaces?
Also as a continuation of this example, if all the processes exited, how 
can you manage namespaces which leaked? where should you go to see these 
sockets if /proc is tightly related to pspace on the task, but there are 
no tasks?

ha ha :) won't start flaming with you.

My question is the same! Why?

Yup. Would be nice to switch to networking, IPC or something like this.
