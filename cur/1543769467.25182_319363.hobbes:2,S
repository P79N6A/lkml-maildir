You will probably be able to address this by building psmouse and evdev
as modules and doing the following sequence:
1) chvt away from X
2) rmmod psmouse & evdev
3) suspend & resume as normal
4) modprobe psmouse & evdev
5) switch back
The hibernate script (see 
http://suspend2.net
) can make this less
painful if you want it.
In the case of USB mice, you will probably want to unload not just
psmouse & evdev, but the whole set of USB modules.
