Sorry for the second post, but I took a look at the .tar.gz issue in midnight commander. It doesn't appear to have anything to do with the executable permission, the problem is that the filesystem isn't writable. I get the same flood of errors on the console trying to tar xvzf the file as I do in mc...
"Could not create file: No such file or directory"
So it's not a problem with mc. There's no problem if I use the --directory switch with the tar command to specify a writable location to extract to. I also can copy the same file, to my home directory and retain the same permissions, and extract it using mc just fine.
