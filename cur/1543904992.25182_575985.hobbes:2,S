Hello everyone,
I've tossed out seekwatcher v0.3.  The major changes are using rolling
averages to smooth out the seek and throughput graphs, and it can
generate mpgs of the IO done by a given trace.
Here's a sample of the smoother graphs (creating 20 kernel trees):

There are details and sample movies of the kernel tree run at:
