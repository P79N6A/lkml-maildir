How does this creation of a thread pool work with respect to CPU
hotplug?  What happens if a CPU goes away?  How about if only one CPU
is running when the driver is loaded, and then 15 more are hot-added?

And it seems in the destroy function, you will possibly leak threads
or try to kill a non-existent thread if the set of online CPUs has
changed since the driver started...
