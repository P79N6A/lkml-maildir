So while digging on a strange OOM issue we were seeing (which actually
ended up being fixed by Steven's softirq patch), I noticed that the fix
above is incomplete. With only the patch above, we may no longer have
unscheduled tasklets added to the list, but we may end up with scheduled
tasklets that are not on the list (and will stay that way!).
The following additional patch should correct this issue. Although since
we weren't actually hitting it, the issue is a bit theoretical, so I've
not been able to prove it really fixes anything.
thanks
