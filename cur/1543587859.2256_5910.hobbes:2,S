(BTW, read the ACPI 2.0 spec - it's a lot better)
ACPI is meant to abstract the OS from all the "magic numbers". It's very
possible to do things in a platform-specific way, but if you want to handle
all platforms, you'd end up with something ACPI-like.

We're working on this. The major issue now is device power management.
