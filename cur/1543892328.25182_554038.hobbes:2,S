Just so there is no misunderstanding, I added the allocation bits.
No idea who added the direct usage of ->sysdata for NUMA info.

Patch leakage?  I thought I had removed this portion, as being specific
to PCI domains.
No objection, obviously, and it's obviously safe given that
CONFIG_PCI_DOMAINS is not defined on x86/x86-64.
Nonetheless, it appears "off-topic" for NUMA/Calgary purposes.
ACK everything, but IMO the pci_domain_nr() bits should be in a separate
patch.
