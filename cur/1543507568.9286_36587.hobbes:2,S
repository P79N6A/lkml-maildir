Hmmm...now is that triple-encrypt, or encrypt-decrypt-encrypt?
	ROT39(x) == ROT13(ROT-13(ROT13(x))) == ROT13(x)
How about ROT13 with double the number of key bits?  That would be...
	ROT169(x) == ROT(169%26)(x) == ROT13(x)
This encryption algorithm resists all attempts to strengthen it!  
It must be Clipper-ROT13!
