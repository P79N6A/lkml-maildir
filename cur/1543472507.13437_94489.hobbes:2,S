John Kennedy <jk@csuchico.edu> has been having problems with various
SMP kernels.
I just wanted to note that I've been running 2.1.131 (no ac patches)
on a Dual PII-450/Supermicro P6DBU system, with absolutely no
problems. I do parallel kernel builds a lot, a lot of other compiling,
CD roasting, and audio processing. Its completely stable. The only
problems I've had have been SCSI bus resets due to my CD-RW behaving
bizarrely when it has no disc in it. Full config at
