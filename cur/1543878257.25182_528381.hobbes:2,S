I am sorry but this wont help in the case you mentioned in an earlier mail :
If nf_conntrack_max  < nf_conntrack_htable_size, cnt will be set to 1.
Then in __early_drop() you endup in breaking the list_for_each_entry_reverse() 
loop after the first element was tested ! Not what you intended I'm afraid, 
because you wont event scan the whole chain as before your patch :(
I believe you should not test --cnt in __early_drop() but in the caller.
(That is not counting the number of found cells, but the number of hash chains 
you tried)
