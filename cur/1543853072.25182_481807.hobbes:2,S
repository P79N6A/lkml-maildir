yep, that is why physical mode doesn't hurt much.

Sorry, but everytime IPIs and all the other overhead etc. are involved even 10 BSFs 
would be completely  in the noise.  The relative cost is so much smaller.
I think you're barking up the wrong tree here regarding that loop.
There are surely inefficiencies in the code, but I don't think they're
related to cpu loops.
[BTW the code for the cpu loop is much worse than it could be [1], but 
that's a different story. But even with the worse code it doesn't matter much]
[1] I had an optimization patch for find_next_bit for that case once but gcc
didn't like it and fixing it completely (= getting rid of the bogus 
additional test) would require auditing all architectures. I didn't push
it very hard because I didn't have much evidence it is really performance
critical -- compared to cache misses and locks it is all small fries.

I don't think it's a bug -- it's inherent.

Yes agreed the magic macros are ugly. It has historical reasons from i386 (and I'm 
partly to blame). Essentially it comes out of the mess that i386 subarchs 
are and when moving genapic to x86-64 that particular ugliness wasn't cleaned up.

Help us with what exactly?

Yes that's a real risk.
Probably need a solution for your chipset. But currently as proposed by you it 
would be robbing Peter to pay Paul.

Ok assuming temporarily it's a bug, how would you want to fix it?
