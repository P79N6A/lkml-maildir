I switched to Linux RedHat 9, XFree 4.3.0, running with vanilla 2.4.20 
and my module.
I didn't change anything into my code, but the problem with X freezing 
while loading
with my module (called clgdtv ) insmoded into the kernel dissapeared.
Maybe someone can help me with a hint about what's going on, and how should
I handle interlocking between X and clgdtv.
