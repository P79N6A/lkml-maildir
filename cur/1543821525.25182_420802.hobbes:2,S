Subject: [PATCH] Fix the case of multiple HPT3xx chips present
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello.
    init_chipset_hpt366() modifies some fields of the ide_pci_device_t 
structure depending on the chip's revision, so pass it a copy of the structure 
to avoid issues when multiple different chips are present.
    Should apply on top of the hotswap fix.
MBR, Sergei
