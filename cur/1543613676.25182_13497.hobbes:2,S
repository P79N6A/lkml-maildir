One thing I noticed when doing the BSD cred patch for 2.5.x is that
somebody broke the process accounting in 2.[45].x at least for the
case of reparent_to_init():
If you just charge current->user without moving over the process from
the old uid to the new uid (such as is done in kernel/sys.c with the
set_user() routine) then you risk seriously corrupting the counters.
I'm not sure really what the point was of setting the user in
reparent_to_init() in the first place, since it doesn't setreuid().
Cheers,
