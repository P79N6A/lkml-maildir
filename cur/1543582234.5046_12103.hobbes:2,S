Some words from the Ural mountains...
I wouldn't suggest to use my code in a production environment today (that's
why it's labelled 'EXPERIMENTAL' :o) ):
- I'm bad at handling Receive Data Overflow events. Here I suffer
from the lack of ability to trigger it. Now that I'm sharing my flat
with a (decent) traffic analyzer, I should be able to fix that.
- there are issues with the upper layers (I must do some more test
and document the whole). 
- the current way to handle the 'DSCC4 sometime forgets events' failure is
really gross and sub-optimal.
I've found time to buy a brand new computer and it should *really* help for 
these two points.
So far, my driver hasn't the required reliability that one expects to 
build a 4 ports router. Etinc's one may be better at this now*.
Well, I'll fix it. No need to be a genius.
Dennis, thanks to your closed source vision, I found an opportunity to 
fill a gap. Now, some people are willing to make $$$ with me.
*but it's not that difficult to find a way to crash it. A "Don't do that"
section on Etincs site would nicely replace the "Mine is bigger than yours" 
pages.
