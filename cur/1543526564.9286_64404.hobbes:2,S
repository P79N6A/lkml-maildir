Hi all,
  I wanted to use VGA16 framebuffer on 2.3.x but couldn't. I've read
  some codes, and found the reason in arch/i386/kernel/setup.c:
  static struct resource vram_resource =
        { "Video RAM area", 0xa0000, 0xbffff, IORESOURCE_BUSY };
                                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  (This protects any other requests, even in drivers/video/vfa16fb.c.)
  Then, I changed it as:
  static struct resource vram_resource =
        { "Video RAM area", 0xa0000, 0xbffff, IORESOURCE_MEM | IORESOURCE_AUTO };
  and I met Tux penguin again. But, my box did hang up when loading
  pcmcia modules. Perhaps, my change might occur this problem.  So,
  tell me more smart fix.
  Thanks,
	A.Yoshiyama <yosshy@debian.or.jp>
