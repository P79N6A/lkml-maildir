perfctr0 is already programmed. You can just use rdpmc on it
Also my latest patchkit has a debugging patch for lost tries
ftp://ftp.firstfloor.org/pub/ak/x86_64/quilt/patches/lost-cli-debug
Can you test it with this patch? 
I'm still not quite convinced you're barking at the right tree
with these latency traces because it doesn't match the symptoms.
If some particular critical section would take too long the 
interrupt should occur at its STI or POPF or one instruction after it. 
But they happen on STIs that are not related to any critical section. 
This more looks like a lost CLI to me.

This is very long, but still less than a tick (assuming HZ=250) 
I guess it would be a good idea to add some code to split this up
though and enable interrupts more often, but that probably won't fix 
your problem.
