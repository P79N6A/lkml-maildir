The file in question is copyright UCB.
UCB has recently dropped the problematical clause (3) of the license,
and the BSD license without that does not conflict with the GPL. UCB
as the copyright holder can drop that. They did. So there is no problem.
The other few BSDed files are only a few include files that define
some constants for the sockets API (it is an interface, not actual
code). They are only a few lines anyways. 
The Linux Sockets code itself has no relation to BSD, except
that it tries to be bug-to-bug compatible.
