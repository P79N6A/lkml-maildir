Hi Jan Engelhardt,
My purpose is to provide serial interfaces for debugging. My real box
acts as remote host connecting to VMWare box by a *virtual* serial cable
so that I can set up a debugging environment.
There are several solutions for this problem but they could only run on
Windows. Eg:
- - 
http://www.mks.zp.ua/vspdxp.php
- - 
http://www.virtual-serial-port.com/virtual-serial-port-kit.html
I'll buy an USB-to-Serial cable and a Serial-Serial cable to solve this
problem but it's also interesting for me to write such device driver.
I'll try it later.
Mikado
