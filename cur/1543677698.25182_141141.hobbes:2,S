Yep, I have a patch to do the same thing.  Sorry, didn't realise you
were working on this too; I should've cc'd you.

Yes.  Some people felt my patch didn't go far enough (they wanted
_everything_ as its own little file, and damn the dentry/inode
consumption!), but it's resurrectable.
My personal feeling is that we should leave the resources file alone
(except for fixing its formatting; patch already with greg), expose the
config file and expose the contents of the resources.

I think we probably shouldn't since that requires additional testing &
fixing of stuff for those of us with multiple-domain boxes.

I actually eliminated pci_bus_exists() completely in my tree.
pci_find_bus() does the job just as well.

We're definitely moving in the same direction ;-)
Here's one place we differ...

I create them anyway, but put the domain on the front.  I bet that'll
break Alpha too (I've read further in the thread but need to reply from
here ..)

I'd prefer not to touch it.

Let's make slot_name a pointer to the struct device busid.
