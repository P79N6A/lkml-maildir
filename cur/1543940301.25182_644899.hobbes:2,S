Nearly 25% of the messages in my dmesg come from ACPI.
Plus many other messages that cover these generic resources stuff (e.g. 
BIOS map or ioport/iomem reservations).
All of these tend to be of great help when debugging driver regressions, 
since diff'ing the dmesg's often is enough for determining whether it's 
a driver problem or a PCI/ACPI/whatever problem.
