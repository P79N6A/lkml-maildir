Yes, I had noticed this yesterday aternoon as well, Andrew. Sorry about that.
Upon looking at it using unsigned long should be the superset of all the
definitions, so I'm working on a patch to align that, and am testing it on all
the arches I have available here (x86, x86_64, ia64, and perhaps ppc64 if I can
get hold of it).  I also have a few more bugs that need fixing in the
core_pattern/pipe code as well as one more feature enhancement (the ability to
pass an argv array).  I'll fix up the bugs first, and you can expect these
patches in the next day or two.
Thanks & Regards
