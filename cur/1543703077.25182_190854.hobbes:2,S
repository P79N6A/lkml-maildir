Unforch, that seems to shut down the opening of the error advisory 
window.  It just sits there showing a blank (data wise) screen. And 
extensive scrolling back thru about 5 megs of the output doesn't 
disclose a missing file that I can see.  How would I go about 
redirecting that output to grep, it seems to bypass an
 "strace -f ksysguard|grep open"
