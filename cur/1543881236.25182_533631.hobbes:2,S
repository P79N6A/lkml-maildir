On that note, what exactly is wanted for (assuming there was a maintainer) 
reiser4 to be suitable for inclusion in the kernel? To my knowledge (and 
I'll admit, I haven't looked in to it very far) the primary reason for 
rejection was that it broke coding standards.
If there was 1) a maintainer and 2) code that didn't break "coding 
standards", would it be included in the kernel?
