	This thread really belongs on either the ip-masq or the ipchains
list.  Please use one of those lists in the future or carry it to private
mail.
	Try adding the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local, changing
"172.16.0.0/255.255.255.0" to the appropriate network/netmask for your
internal network.  Make sure you have ip forwarding turned on (see the IP
Masquerade resource for instructions on how to do this, or see the
documentation for your distribution.
if [ -f /proc/net/ip_fwchains ]; then
	#Place the ipchains versions of your rules here
	#Masquerade from internal lan out
       /sbin/ipchains -A forward -s 172.16.0.0/255.255.255.0 -j MASQ
elif [ -f /proc/net/ip_input ]; then
	#Place the ipfwadm versions of your rules here.
	#Masquerade from internal lan out
       /sbin/ipfwadm -F -a accept -m -S 172.16.0.0/255.255.255.0
fi
	Cheers,
	- Bill
