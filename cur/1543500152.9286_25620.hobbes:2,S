Greetings.
Okay, I read the archives, I searched the Net and now I need to post.
I have posted before with MIPS questions and you can go here to see
what I am doing:

I am making progress on my bootloader to boot Linux under WinCE. I am
working from a bootloader that already boots NetBSD on a WinCE device.
In the NetBSD kernel code there is the ability to build a library
'libsa' which is essentially and stand alone library that can read UFS
filesystems. I have poked and prodded around in the Linux kernel
source tree, but have not really found a good way to approach this. I
am looking for ideas and just a little direction at this point. Thanks
in advance. Also, be patient with my little webserver. It is just a
SPARCstation IPC running RH 5.2 . Cheers.
