Brutal, but sensible enough: revert to how things looked before
we ever starting putting vm_pgoff to work on anonymous areas.
I slightly regret losing that visible clue to whether an anonymous
vma has ever been mremap moved.  But have I ever actually used that
info?  No, never.
I presume you test !vma->vm_file so the lines fit in, fair enough.
But I think you'll find checkpatch.pl protests at "(!vma->vm_file)?"
I dislike its decisions on the punctuation of the ternary operator
- perhaps even more than Andrew dislikes the operator itself!
Do we write a space before a question mark? no: nor before a colon;
but I also dislike getting into checkpatch.pl arguments!
While you're there, I'd also be inclined to make task_nommu.c
use the same loff_t cast as task_mmu.c is using.
