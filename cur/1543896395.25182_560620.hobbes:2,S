Agreed.  Credit card companies are failing very badly at preventing skimming. 
They definitely need to rethink their model of how the credit card system should 
work.

I agree as well, the model could be heavily abused.  I'm not sure what the 
solution is as far as fighting monopolies and corporate greed.  But I'd rather 
that it was fought through education of consumers and not with a license 
agreement that should be giving people freedom.  A balance of freedom to the 
licensee and the licenser.  It's my opinion that GPLv3 potentially shifts the 
balance too far to the licensee.
