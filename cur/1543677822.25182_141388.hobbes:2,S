Hi,
I've been doing some experiments with the 2.4.21 kernel, and the ptrace 
exploit: the result of which is that I've compiled a kernel with the 
processor set to i386.  I then ran this kernel on 2 computers, one is a Duron 
machine with SIS chipset, the other is a Pentium 4 machine with the Intel 845 
chipset. The exploit still gave me a root shell on the Pentium 4 machine, but 
didn't on the Duron one.
I've read the previous post about this, and in both cases I only logged in as 
an unprivileged user.  I didn't login as root and then su to an unprivileged 
use first. I checked to see that I was root by opening /etc/shadow.
The exploit used was:

The config file for the kernel I compiled is at:

Any ideas?
