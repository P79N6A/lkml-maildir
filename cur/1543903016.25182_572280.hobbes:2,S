Well, I didn't write the above, so it's more complex than it needs to
be.
For bitfields where the user can input any value we would usually add to
the header:
   #define AT91_SSC_STTDLY_(x)   ((x) << 16)
   #define AT91_SSC_PERIOD_(x)   ((x) << 24)
Then it can simply be re-written as:
rcmr = AT91_SSC_PERIOD(ssc_p->rcmr_period)
	| AT91_SSC_STTDLY(1)
	| AT91_SSC_START_FALLING_RF
	| AT91_SSC_CK_RISING
	| AT91_SSC_CKO_NONE
	| AT91_SSC_CKS_DIV;

But the user does then constantly have to refer to the datasheet to
determine what CKI = 1 or CKS = 0 means.
