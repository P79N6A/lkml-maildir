rusty you may want to review your rules before this gets in ;)
the "Trivial Patch Monkey" is neither documented in MAINTAINERS
nor was there a note in SubmittingPatches, i hope this helps
further recognition and easier catch
so let the monkey apply himself in re-transmission mode!
please apply

 Even if the maintainer did not respond in step #4, make sure to ALWAYS
 copy the maintainer when you change their code.
 
+For small patches you may want to CC Trivial Patch Monkey 
+trivial@rustcorp.com.au set up by Rusty Russel which collects "trivial" 
+patches. Trivial patches must qualify for one of the following rules:
+ Spelling fixes in documentation
+ Spelling fixes which could break grep(1).
+ Warning fixes (cluttering with useless warnings is bad)
+ Compilation fixes (only if they are actually correct)
+ Runtime fixes (only if they actually fix things)
+ Removing use of deprecated functions/macros (eg. check_region).
+ Contact detail and documentation fixes
+ Non-portable code replaced by portable code (even in arch-specific, 
+ since people copy, as long as it's trivial)
+ Any fix by the author/maintainer of the file. (ie. patch monkey 
+ in re-transmission mode)
