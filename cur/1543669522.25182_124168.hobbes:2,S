That would be the sources to the original 2.3.1 or 2.3.2 (depending).
That would -not- be the sources to
ftp://people.redhat.com/drepper/glibc/2.3.1-25/
*.rpm, which is a
derivative version.  Shall we play the GPL game? The bins were
distribute to me (they're sitting on the machine in question) with no
sources available.  
C'mon people, enough with the obvious/troll/etc .. if you don't have the
source or patches used to generate those bins (and you don't know where
to get them) then its a safe bet that I'm not talking to you....
(And fwiw, I did find parts of them by spending a few hours curled up
with the glibc cvs list archive, changelog, etc. But - as has been noted
in the various B*K* flamewars - cvs does a really horrid job of
changeset management.. its even more entertaining when you try to use
cvsweb to extact them..)
