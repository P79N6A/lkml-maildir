Yes, everything does the right there here.

No, not at all.  This sub-thread is all about tags/ dir updates.  Users 
should be able to do
	git pull-more rsync://...
and get ALL of .git/refs/tags/* that have appeared since their last update.
Concrete example:  I have a git tree on local disk.  I need to find out 
where, between 2.6.12-rc1 and 2.6.12, a driver broke.  This requires 
that I have -ALL- linux-2.6.git/refs/tags on disk already, so that I can 
bounce quickly and easily between tags.
It is valuable to have a local copy of -all- tags, -before- you need 
them.  That is why people like me and GregKH use rsync directly.  We 
want EVERYTHING in the kernel.org linux-2.6.git tree, not just what we 
know we need right now.
