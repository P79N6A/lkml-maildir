Well, that's what I'd like to know.
System Call Auditing just yielded a few google results but it doesn't seem to 
me like a well documented feature. More like people asking for it.

Indeed.
And just that made me hope there is something like an auditing or monitoring 
framework just like for instance a accessible struct with several function 
pointers where one could insert funtions to be processed whenever event x 
occurs. This kind of thing yould be maintained by the kernel developers who 
could put the hook just in the right place and the 'user' (which would be me 
in that case) could be sure that his function would be called in the right 
time and from the right place.
That would be nice.
