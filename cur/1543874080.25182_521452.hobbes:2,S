i have never seen Windows (or were you talking about Mac OSX ?) run 
smooth. Win2k (scheduler) is almost usable if your computer is very fast 
but on common hardware every version of windows for me was a joke. or
maybe you have a special version ;) [1]
I don't run KDE or Gnome in linux so ... maybe that's the problem ;)
[1] And no, i don't consider waiting 2-5-20-50 seconds for a program to 
start a feature. YMMV
