ELKS (
http://elks.sourceforge.net
) has it's own mailing list:
linux-8086@vger.kernel.org you can subscribe using majordomo. This
would be the best place to discuss this.
It's not a Linux port rather a subset and implementation for 8086.
Currently it is mostly set up to run off PC architecture, depending on
the board it may run out of the box, or may require some porting. If the
board supports floppy or an IDE hdd you probably can quickly check if
you can get a bootable system

ELKS is bootable - and there is a user space, without a closer look I
couldn't say if it would work out of the box on this board.  There are
stock boot images, as well as EDE which is designed to install ELKS onto
the HDD.  Some of the ELKS developers are working on other install
scripts.
I suggest you subscribe to linux-8086 and we'll see what we can do to
help you.  Some more details about the board might help us. There is
also a #elks channel on irc.freenode.net.
