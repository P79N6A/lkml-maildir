The question is rather how often it's really seen.
I've tested 4 different gcc versions and a couple of other versions
with cross compiling occasionally, and this warning doesn't appear on
any versions.

Well, did we get a consensus about this?  If yes, I'll follow it, of
course.
Adding uninitialized_var() essentially means to disable the check,
thus a new real bug in future might be overlooked.  This is a bigger
drawback if it's just a warning that appears in only one old buggy gcc
version.
That's why I wrote "adding it *unconditionally*".  If the warning
appears in many gcc versions, it's worth to hide.
thanks,
Takashi
