Of course it gets to use ARP, nothing prevents this.
If I know that IP X has my configuration information, I
have every right to send X a packet from zero-net to
ask for that information before I have any IP addresses
attached to the interface.
This is nothing wrong nor strange about this and we've
supported it for years.
Also, when one specifies a specific device in an output
address and we cannot find the IP part of the address
in the routing tables, we still procure a valid route for
the requester.
Besides normal IP addresses, multicast tools use these
facilities.
