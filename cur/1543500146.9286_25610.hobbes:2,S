Things like .so file in /usr/lib, icons in /usr/something/ will be automatically
skipped since this stuff is contained within the application or OS resource fork,
so the search space for a particular file under HFS is much smaller in MacOS
than with Win32/Unix since everything is treated as a file within those OSes. 
That's why a rather broken MacOS can search for a file name much faster than
Win32/Unix, because there aren't that many files to search in the first place.
All the libs/icons/sound file are not file within the FS.
Uh, maybe I'm speaking out of my butt.
Sorry, for the initial reaction.
Clear ?
