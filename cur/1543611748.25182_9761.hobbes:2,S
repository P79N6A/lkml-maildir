Semiconductor technology will push this way because it's no longer possible
to propagate a signal across the die in one clock cycle.  This means
pipeline
interlocking becomes vastly more complicated.  The simple solution puts
several CPU cores on the die, each able to interlock in one clock but
sharing
memory over several clocks.
