Subject: [PATCH] remove RPM_BUILD_ROOT from asm-offsets.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/24/27

No file in rpm binary package should have the RPM_BUILD_ROOT string in
it. To simplify building of external modules, our kernel-source package
contains some temp files from the Kbuild system.
asm/asm-offsets.h is one of the files that contains the absolute path if
make O=$O is used.
  * This file was generated by /var/tmp/kernel-source-2.6.14_rc4-build/usr/src/linux-2.6.14-rc4-2/Kbuild
Remove the $RPM_BUILD_ROOT string in the shipped tempfile.
