Thanks to everyone who has replied.
I just wanted to remark that I had earlier the same problem with
2.6.0-test4, so it seems strange to me that 2.6.0-test5 would work ok.
I upgraded pppoe to 3.5 in hope that it would help, but that was
probably pointless given that the same problem occurs in pure dialup
context.
I can also offer help with diagnosing, but I feel that I would need some
even more detailed guidance than Andrev (preferably in form of patches,
as I have zero experience with kernel debugging).
