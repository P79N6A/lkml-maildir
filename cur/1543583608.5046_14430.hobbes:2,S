You could always rename /dev to /devold, copy the rest of your
device files back, and run "mknod /dev/dsp c 14 3" to recreate
/dev/dsp.
You probably need to boot using a rescue floppy (tomsrtbt if
needed), and run debugfs to delete them.  It is strange
that you can't even delete these files.  Sometimes there is a
problem with files > 2GB in size, but there should be no
problems with block special or pipes.  What sort of errors do
you get, and is there anything in syslog?
Cheers, Andreas
