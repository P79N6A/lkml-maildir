Hi Robert,
This does not look symmetrical, add and sub and bitops...

And since it has to be zero to end up in the routine anyway...
asmlinkage void preempt_schedule(void)
 {
	BUG_ON(current_thread_info()->preempt_count != 0);
	do {
		/* Problem: suppose a new interrupt happens before we got to set
		 * preempt_count... then we will call this routine recursively.
		 * innermost will select the correct process, but wont it be scheduled
		 * away in enclosing preempt_schedule() - schedule() will be called
		 * with PREEMPT_ACTIVE but not TIF_NEED_RESCHED...
		 * (goto pick_next_task) */
		current_thread_info()->preempt_count = PREEMPT_ACTIVE;
		/* interrupts here might cause calls to preempt_schedule() but those will
		   bounce off above since preempt_count != 0 */
		schedule();
		current_thread_info()->preempt_count = 0;
		/* interrupt here will possibly preempt the right process - no problem */
		/* need to check if any interrupt happened during the preemption off time,
		 * this case is in fact unlikely  */
	while (unlikely(test_thread_flag(TIF_NEED_RESCHED)));
