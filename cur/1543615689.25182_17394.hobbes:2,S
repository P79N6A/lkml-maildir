something about 4 month ago I had a card like this one.
I put it in my desktop and couldn't load the module( no crash). 
I don't remember the error but I can get it back into my desktop and
have some test with it. I was problably using 2.4.7 at this time (
vanilla compiled by me , not the debian one ).
