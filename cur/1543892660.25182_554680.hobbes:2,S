I added a MODULE_AUTHOR("J. Ørsted <jorsted@foobar.com>") into the "raw" 
module:
# echo $LANG
C
# modinfo --version
module-init-tools version 3.3-pre11
# modinfo raw
filename:       /lib/modules/2.6.21.2/kernel/drivers/char/raw.ko
author:         J. Ã
                    ^ the cursor hangs here
So for implementing your proposal, we have to:
- get module-init-tools fixed and
- document that 2.6.23 (or whichever will be the first kernel to support 
  UTF-8 in MODULE_AUTHOR) will require updated module-init-tools.
Oh, and when you are anyway planning to break older userspace, can you 
remove the obsolete "raw" driver at the same time?  ;-)
