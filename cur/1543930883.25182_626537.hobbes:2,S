Hi, Ingo:
I guess it is a good news. I did patch 2.6.21.7 kernel using your cfs 
patch. The results of pthread_sync is the same as the non-patched 2.6.21 
kernel. This means the performance of is not related to the scheduler. 
As for overhead of the gettimeofday, there is no difference between 
2.6.21 and 2.6.24-rc4. The reference time is around 10.5 us for both 
kernel.
So what is changed between 2.6.21 and 2.6.22? Any hints :-). Thank you 
very much for all your help.
