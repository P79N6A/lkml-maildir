Okay! A little background: I've been having truly random lockups under my
SMP kernel. Usually it involves high levels of network activity (which for
me means X -- my box is a headless server).[1]
I thought this was solved, but it isn't obviously. The only kernel I can
run without problems is a patched IKD kernel with all the bells and
whistles turned on. Unfortunately, I cannot survive the 20% performance
drop due to the debugging code.
While running 2.2.6-arca1 today, I had my daily lockup, but got instead
some information instead of nothing.

wait_on_bh,  CPU 0
irq: 2 [0 2]
bh: 1 [0 1]

[<c0108b10>]
--end quote--
which resolves to:
Trace: c010a6e9 <synchronize_bh+3d/50>
Trace: c0118aef <do_getitimer+3f/bc>
Trace: c0118c4d <do_setitimer+31/104>
Trace: c0112da4 <sys_alarm+30/40>
Trace: c0128234 <sys_write+fc/120>
Trace: c0108b10 <system_call+34/38>
Please, let me know what I can do to help solve this. As it stands, I'm
going to replace my 2 x 233 with 1 500 just to have the stability I need.
As always, lotsa information available upon request. And you can always

recap :)
