Please note that this patch has a single purpose : to let proprietary
modules define markers to *export* information. The opposite (connect
callbacks to markers) is not allowed since the rest of the markers API
is EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL'd.
I would also be strongly against letting proprietary modules access the
information provided by the markers. However, I think it's only useful
for the end user to let proprietary modules open up a bit, considering
that proprierary module writers can use the markers as they want
in-house, but would have to leave them disabled on shipped kernels.
As far as I am concerned, I want to help the end user, not the
technology itself.
Unless I have a proof that markers in proprietary modules (information
*providers* only) would be a pain to maintain, I won't object against
supporting proprietary modules.
