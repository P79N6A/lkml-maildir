The Posix high-res timer stuff, I think.  Have you tried expressing
what you want user programs to do in terms of Posix high-res timers yet?

Yes; perhaps you could create a service provider interface
for the posix high-res timer stuff, then use that SPI
to plug your hardware in?
I may be way off base here, but it does seem like it's due dilligence
to verify that you're not reinventing an interface here.
