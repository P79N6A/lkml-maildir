Well, this is why the hard links were made, no?
FWIW, I believe that rename of an open file might also produce this problem.

The problem with NFS is that fileid isn't enough because the client doesn't
know about removes by other clients until it uses the stale filehandle.
Also, quite a few file systems are not keeping fileids unique (this triggered
