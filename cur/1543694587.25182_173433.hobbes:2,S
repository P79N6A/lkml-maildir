Hi,
Seems that something changed between test7 and test8 regarding initrd or romfs 
support. I'm using highly modularized 2.6.0 kernel which has all filesystems 
beside romfs compiled as modules (romfs is compiled inside of kernel).
Modules for my rootfs are loaded from initrd (which is image with romfs as 
filesystem) but starting from test8 kernel is not able to mount initrd 
filesystem - stops with typical message about not being able to mount rootfs.
cset test7 from 20031012_0407 is known to be ok so something was changed later
