Nope.  It's actually one of the amusing places where there *is* no rule.
Plurals that end in s always get just the apostrophe.  But for singular
nouns that end in s, while I tend to think of "'s" as the default, some
people like to drop the final s if the result ("Sophocles's") would
otherwise sound awkward spoken aloud.
If you really can't stand the ambiguity, go for "Mail from Linus
Torvalds on the canonical patch format:".
