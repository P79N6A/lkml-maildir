The system is not shipped yet.
Normally PNP0501 is coming with superio section in DSDT. So i think
late BIOS if have acpi there, that should be there already.
Problem is that some new design may get rid of superio, but SB could
have extra uart for serial port. at that case BIOS may not have that
PNP0501...
I don't think revert is reasonable.
or we can make legacy_serial.force=1 is default at this point.
