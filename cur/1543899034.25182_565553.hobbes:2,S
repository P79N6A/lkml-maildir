Yes, for some reason Kmail somethmes does this when cut-and-pasting
from another email. I don't think it does it when cutting and pasting
from anywhere else...

I was not... The copy I got from LKML looks fine in Kmail, Gmail and
MS Outlook.
The thing is I like Kmail because it never screwed up patches that I sent
out. I guess I will just stop cutting and pasting e-mails and just adjust
my script that generates changelog and diffstat. The issue may even be
already fixed in newer versions of Kmail, I am a little behind times with
my setup...
