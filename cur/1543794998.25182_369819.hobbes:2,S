I don't have access to my test environment for the rest of the week so I
can't actually try them out.
However, reading through the patches, they appear to duplicate a
significant amount of the existing drain_local_pages() functions and they
only drain the pages on the currently running CPU. On a system with a
number of CPUs, you will only be improving your chances slightly.
I think you would get more of what you need with this patch if;
1. Removed the compile time dependency on CONFIG_PM||CONFIG_HOTPLUG
2. Rechecked the usage of smp_processor_id() (although I don't think it's
    wrong because it's only called with local IRQs disabled)
3. Draining the CPUs after direct reclaim and the allocation still failing
This patch does everything you need including the draining of remove
per-cpus.
