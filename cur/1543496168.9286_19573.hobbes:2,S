Well, I just tried it with a different Zip drive.  I switched cables
around, too.  The zip drives both work fine.  I can mount, read, write,
whatever, zip disks.  But the pass-through refuses to work.  The
printer seems like it's not connected.  Then I unplug the Zip drive,
and plug the printer in, and voila!, the print queue starts spewing
forth in paper form.
It's definitely not a hardware problem.  I tested both on my NT box,
and printing, etc, works just fine through the pass-through.  My only
option left is to believe it's something messed up in the parport code.
 Has it changed since 2.1.x?  This same setup worked in 2.1.x (well,
 the 90s, anyhow).  I'll double-check the BIOS one more time to be sure
 the port is set up right.  Hopefully I will find something I've missed
 in there.
BTW, this happens on 2.2.6 - 2.2.9.
