What is "efficiently"?  No one really cares about milliseconds here,
seconds are even tollerable at least for small seconds :)

"proactive"?  udev is "reactive" in that it reacts to the number that
the kernel exports to userspace.  That's all.
Remember, devfs also uses those same, hardcoded numbers...
