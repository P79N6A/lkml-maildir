I focused on the MAX_ORDER allocations for two reasons. The first is
because they are very difficult to satisfy. If we can service MAX_ORDER
allocations, we can certainly service order 3. The second is that my very
long-term (and currently vapour-ware) aim is to transparently support
large pages which will require 4MiB blocks on the x86 at least.

That is what bench-stresshighalloc does with order-10 allocations. It
compiles 7 trees at -j4 for a few minutes and then tries to allocate 160
pages. It tends to manage about 50% of them comparised to 1-5% with the
standard allocator (which also kills everything).

With this allocator, we are still using a blunderbus approach but the
chances of big enough chunks been available are a lot better. I released a
proof-of-concept patch that freed pages by linearly scanning that worked
very well, but it needs a lot of work. Linearly scanning would help
guarantee high-order allocations but the penalty is that LRU-ordering
would be violated.
To test lower-order allocations, I ran a slightly different test where I
tried to allocate 6000 order-5 pages under heavy pressure. The standard
allocator repeatadly went OOM and allocated 5190 pages. The modified one
did not OOM and allocated 5961. The test is not very fair though because
it pins memory and the allocations are type GFP_KERNEL. For the gigabit
ethernet and network filesystem tests, I imagine we are dealing with
GFP_ATOMIC or GFP_NFS?
