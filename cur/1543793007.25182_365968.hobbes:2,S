I use the following on my device:
        mtd = do_map_probe(...);
        if (!mtd) { ...err... }
        
        mtd->owner = THIS_MODULE;
        
        mtd->unlock(mtd,0,mtd->size);

Yep, but you could modify the parameters to unlock to no do so.
Depending on you partitioning scheme you might be able to use that to
figure out what to unlock...
