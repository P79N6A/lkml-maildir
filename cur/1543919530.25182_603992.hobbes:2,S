I'm not absolutely sure of anything but I have merged our two git
trees quite a few times during the 2.6.23 cycle and I have not seen
any conflicts.  Unless you've added some more IB changes very recently
I don't think there should be any problem.

I'm not sure what you mean.  During the 2.6.23 cycle I've been sending
any patches that potentially could conflict with the net-2.6 tree to
you and Jeff so that you can merge them upstream via your tree.  Or do
you mean Jeff should become the maintainer of drivers/infiniband??
Can't you guys just keep the networking stuff contained in its little
box so it doesn't create maintenance problems for InfiniBand stuff?

I don't mind waiting but I guess it's up to Linus really.
