    Wrong.
    When I run 2.3.x kernels with the WE_HATE_AOUT nanny-code in, I
    get literally thousands of messages shovelling into my syslog if
    I run the kernel for any longer than just to boot the machine up
    to see if the e820 stuff works.
    If the grand scheme is to forbid a.out executables from a ``modern''
    linux system, binfmt_aout should simply be removed from the baseline
    kernel.

    When you say ``modern'', do you mean ``modern'' as in stuff that
    uses recent copies of the system programs, or stuff that uses the
    politically correct executable format?   Mastodon INST0050, which
    was built completely from current source (except for the kernel,
    because 2.3.x is somewhat broken, and the libc5 junk) last month
    makes 2.3.x vomit out scads of ABSOLUTELY USELESS, BECAUSE I'M
    NOT GOING TO SWITCH FROM USING A.OUT FOR MY USERLAND, error
    messages.

    If the grand scheme is to not allow a.out executables, then take
    the binfmt_aout module out of the baseline kernel.   I don't take
    kindly to the idea of 7 machines spitting out "a.out executables
    are evil" messages every 5 seconds to my log system.
