Well I expect once you start letting people easily build strings by
concatenation, you'll very shortly afterwards have people using them
in loops. And having hidden O(n^2) behavior in there is a little sad,
even though n will tend to be small and well-bounded. If we can do
something simple to avoid it, we should.
