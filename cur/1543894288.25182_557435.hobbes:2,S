Have you ever wondered *why* it limited the hardware?
Is it per chance such that I cannot modify the software that runs on
the hardware?
How is that respecting the freedoms?  How is this not imposing further
restrictions?
And, more importantly, how is it that permitting this makes for
*better* compliance with your tit-for-tat conceptions about the GPL?
I.e., if Tivoization is the only issue that you think makes GPLv3 a
worse license than GPLv2, and you like GPLv2 because of this
tit-for-tat, surely you should be able to explain why Tivoization
promotes this tit-for-tat notion better than GPLv3, right?
