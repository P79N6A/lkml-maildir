More or less, yes.  The basic problem is platforms that simply cannot
make this type of bus remote memory visible in the CPU page tables at
all (the IBM AS/400 apparently falls into that).  Then there are the
ones that could be persuaded to do this with great difficulty and a lot
of restrictions (sparc and parisc).

Yes, I think everyone has more or less a struct page backed allocator,
although we could first consult an exception table hanging off the
device somehow to get around this.

But we still need some sort of fallback where the platform really cannot
do this.  And that fallback is going to be ioremap and all the other
paraphenalia.  So, the thing that bothers me is that if we have to have
the fallback which is identical to what every other driver that uses
on-chip memory does anyway, is there any point to placing this in the
DMA API?
