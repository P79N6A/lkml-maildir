I have defined "*.* /dev/pty/1" in the /etc/syslogd.conf and the last 
line I saw before crash was
Dec  8 19:29:42 oracle-srv-03 modprobe: modprobe: Can't locate module 
char-major-30
Could these two things be related ?
What can cause such a crash ?
I have RH 9 with custom compiled kernel and it was working about 300 days
without any problems.
I'm using e100, ide, ext3, jfs and oracle 9i on this machine.
Regards,
Blizbor
