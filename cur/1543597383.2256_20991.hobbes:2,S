    sure, that's not a hard guarantee because, on average, you will

    happens once a year, your data should still be good when the
    warrantee on the sun expires.  :-)
the sun will probably last a tad longer than that even contuing to
burn hydrogen, if you allow for helium burning, you will probably get
errors to sneak by
    Surely it can't be that *all* IDE disks can fail in that way?  And
    it seems the jury is still out on SCSI, I'm interested to see
    where that discussion goes.
Alan said *ALL* disks appear to lie, and I'm not going to argue with
him :)
I only have SCSI disks to test with, but they are hot-plug, so I guess
I can write a whole bunch of blocks with different numbers on them,
all over the disk, if I can figure out how to place SCSI barriers and
then pull the drive and see what gives?
