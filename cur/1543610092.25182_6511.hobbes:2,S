Only vaguely.  The current size of the journal is mostly guesswork, because
we don't have any tools to measure if the journal is full or not anyways.

Correct.

No, neither does ext2resize.

Correct.

Like Mike says, there should be very minimal impact to the filesystem
operation, unless you are going from, say, a 16MB filesystem to a 500GB
filesystem.  You also have to watch out if you start with a filesystem
smaller than 500MB - you will get 1kB blocks, and you don't want to have
a large filesystem (10's of GB) with a 1kB blocksize.  There is nothing
that resize2fs or ext2resize can do about that, unfortunately.

It works just fine with ext2resize, and I'm pretty sure resize2fs also
works on ext3 filesystems.
