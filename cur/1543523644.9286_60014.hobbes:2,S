Matthew Wilcox has a patch for 2.2.14 that does this. In fact, a
"move-mount" is even a bit simpler than pivot_root, because you
have two directories instead of three.
Note that you don't really need to do any cleanup, because you never
do a real unmount. All you need to do is to grab the kernel lock in
order to prevent other processes from crossing the mount points while
you're changing them.
