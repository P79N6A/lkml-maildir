- Rewritten Artop host chip driver by Vojtech Pavlik. His log entries are:
   Cleanup whitespace.
   Remove superfluous chip entries in chip table.  Remove global variables to
   allow more than one controller.  Remove other forgotten stuff.
   This is a new driver for the Artop (Acard) controllers. It's completely
   untested, as I have never seen the hardware. However, I suspect it is much
   less broken than the previous one ...
   UDMA33 controller cannot detect 80-wire cable.
- Separate ioctl handling out from ide.c. It's big enough.
- Move atapi_read and atapi_write to the new atapi module.  Fix the declaration
   of those functions. The data buffer did have the void * type!
- Separate module handling code out from actual transfer handling code in to a
   new module called main.c. Slowly we are at the stage where the code indeed
   has to be organized logically and not just "sporadically" as was the case
   before.
- Apply patch by Adam Richter for the ide-scsi.c attach method implementation.
   This particular driver is still broken due to generic SCSI layer issues.
- Apply true modularization patch for qd65xx.c by Samuel Thibault. Here
   are his notes about it:
   Then, patch-modularize-2.[45] is a proposal for modularizing qd65xx.o. As a
   single module, one can choose to insmod it before being able to do some
   hdparm -p /dev/hd[a-d]. But one can't remove it while tuned, since selectproc
   may be needed.
   I am sorry I wasn't able to test it under 2.5 series, lacking a functionning
   kernel for my test computer, but it seemed to work perfectly under 2.4
   series, and patches are almost the same.
- Move PCI device id's to where they belong. Patch by Vojtech Pavlik.
- Don't use BH_Lock in ide-tape.c - somehow this driver scares me sometimes.
Scary big patch this time...
