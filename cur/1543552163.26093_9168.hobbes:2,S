Note that this is not what my patch really says at all.
My patch says "ok, we should invalidate this page, because somebody thinks
it may be bad. HOWEVER, we cannot reasonably do that, because we have
users of the page (which may be completely unrelated to pending writes),
and invalidating this page is _certain_ to cause corruption".
Basically think of the case of somebody having a shared mmap over NFS. He
has dirty data in his pages, and he expects those to be written out to the
server. There is NO QUESTION about this fact.
Imagine somebody (possibly even the same person) then releasing or getting
a file lock, possibly in some other part of the file. 
Without that added test, all those dirty local pages just got completely
thrown away. 
Now, you have a choice: you can KNOW that you're doing something horribly
and utterly wrong (throwing away data), or you can SUSPECT that you might
cause non-coherency between the client and the server. You cannot get
both.
I'm saying that we're much much better off guaranteeing local consistency
over knowingly breaking local consistency over a uncertain global
consistency issue. Especially as NFS has never guaranteed global
consistency in the first place, and was not designed to do that.
