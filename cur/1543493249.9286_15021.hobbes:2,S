not likely. solaris VM is like SVR4, right ?(or rather, the other way
round). their writes go through page cache. their buffer cache is usually
used only for filesystem metadata. so there's no reason to do a copy. but
they have other overheads like having to map the page into kernel space
before doing IO (unlike linux which maps all physical mem, so this step
is trivial).
