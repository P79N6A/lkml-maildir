That question doesn't parse.  There are multiple ways you can do it but 
once you do patches will no longer import cleanly from Linus.  The whole
point of the pristine tree is to give yourself a tree into which you can
import Linus patches.  If you start putting extra stuff in there you will
get patch rejects.
