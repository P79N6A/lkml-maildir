It is not alleged. It is real, but the badness is not universal. I was
afraid I'd have to add another category, but fortunately it seems bk
export matches qsbench: Major regressions neither between test2 and
test3 nor between 2.4 and 2.6.
I'm still interested to learn whether 2.5.39 is a major regression
(fixed later) for bk export, although that might have been due to the
qs specific reference patterns, I haven't looked into it. At least for
qsbench the spike is confirmed though, even with different parameters.
