Most suspend tools are depressingly stupid. That's not a good reason to
push functionality into the kernel. The vast majority of hardware won't
work with that approach at the moment.

Because, well, strictly it wasn't. The LED control functionality in the
IBM-acpi code exists because it exposes methods that are used by the
BIOS in normal usage. It gives some degree of extra flexibility -
there's no point in removing that for the sake of having one fewer line
of shell in a suspend script. I might want the LEDs to be in different
states depending on what triggered the suspend.
