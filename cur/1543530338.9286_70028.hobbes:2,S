Hi Keith,
Thanks for your response.
The SCSI driver is compiled in normally (not as a module) and it
seen without any problems with 2.2.x kernels.
There are 2 PCI buses on this system.  This message "scsi : 0 hosts"
reflects the PCI BUS 00.
I see the same message even with a 2.2.12 kernel and then it goes and finds
the ncr53c8xx on PCI bus 2 and then it's happy.
With a 2.2.12 kernel, the system boots just fine and here are the messages:

However, with a 2.3.29 kernel I get some PCI errors in the beginning
of the probe and I am suspecting that could be bad.
