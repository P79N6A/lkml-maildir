I'm only thinking about the current execution address, and am only
concerned with the handful of instructions between the dec and the
ret.  But I did miss something all right: I'd assumed we somehow
magically wrap all exported functions in inc/dec, which on closer
inspection, isn't the case.

That seems like a reasonable rule to make.  This, along with the
execution address inspection, would give us a way of declaring
certain modules 'remove clean'.  Module removal is just too nice a
feature to give up on so easily.
What else did I miss?
