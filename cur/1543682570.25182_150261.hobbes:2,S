Actually, SysV Streams do.
An ex, for openning a pty, on svr4:
fds = open(pts_name, O_RDWR)
ioctl(fds, I_PUSH, "ptem")
ioctl(fds, I_PUSH, "ldterm")
ioctl(fds, I_PUSH, "ttcompat")
Where ptem, ldterm, ttcompat work as independent modules converting the
stream, resulting in a pseudo-terminal implementation.
New programs should just use openpty directly, and let libc take care
of the actual implementation.
Also, BSD sockets were implemented using streams also, thus the compatibility
libraries.
Anyway, I see no point in caring wether streams are used or not in normal
programs.
