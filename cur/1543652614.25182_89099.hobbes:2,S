Hello,
we recently bougth a 2-year old Compaq HA/100 Cluster consisting of 2 Proliant
6500/550 Servers and a Fibre Channel U2 Storage (don't have the exact name right now).
I have some trouble getting the FC HBAs to work under Linux. The problem seems
to be that the cpqfc driver is only for the 64Bit adapters, but ours is aparently 32Bit.
It uses a HPFC-500c chip, lspci output ist atached.
Is there any way to get this working (including if necessary modifying the driver myself,
provided I can get all the information I need)?
If you need more informations, please tell me, and I will get them for you.
Thanks in advance for any help.
Nico Meyer
