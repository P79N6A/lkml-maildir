Sorry-- my patchbombing script blew up in the middle, and I didn't
restart quite correctly.  But I'm pretty sure all 16 patches did make
it out, although the numbering is screwy.  The correct series is:
    01/16, 02/16, 00/13, 01/13, ..., 13/13
I'm not going to spam everybody and resend to all the lists, but I'm
happy to resend privately to anyone who asks, or you can clone the
git tree to get the series

Thanks,
