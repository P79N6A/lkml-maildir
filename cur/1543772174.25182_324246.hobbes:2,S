How about muti-core?  Does each core also have its own run queue?  Does 
anyone know how multi-core would work with SMT?  Is it possible that they 
work together?  Is the following a possible scenario? :  A node has two 
processors, each processor has two cores, and each core has two "virtual 
cores". And there are 8 run queues in total.
