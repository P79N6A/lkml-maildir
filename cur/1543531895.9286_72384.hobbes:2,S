This does not work in general. In order to protect any given process, you
have to fix the stack allocation of ALL processes, not just the one you
care about. And what do you do in the case of recursion, when you don't
know in advance the number of times you will recurse?
This is also another example of solving the problem by defining all
current software to be broken.

Same problem as before...

Why not just keep overcommit, have malloc() always succeed, and then use a
signal anyway when memory is low? Unfortunately Linux doesn't have any
spare signals lying around -- especially if you use threads (linuxthreads
uses SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2).
4) if ignored, program is put to sleep waiting on free pages.
This leads to a deadlock.

Read my previous mail for some reasons.
