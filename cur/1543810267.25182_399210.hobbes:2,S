Never a victim. I stick my nose where I choose - in this case I stuck it in 
here because I had hoped to turn a discussion I saw descending into a 
flamewar into something productive.

Needlessly? Not true. It was missing from the layer, as all modern ATA devices 
do support some form of ATAPI, which is, as you've so frequently pointed out, 
a form of SCSI. So why is an unneeded thing to introduce the ability to use 
that full capacity?
And here I must parrot Martin Mares - you complain about problems when not 
using ide-scsi but almost all the bugs you've mentioned only occur when using 
ide-scsi. Now, I'll go and finish replying to all the other mails that have 
come into my inbox (on this thread) and not been sorted down because they 
were directly to me.
