That would be good for a new interface, but the existing code depends on
the single linked behavior. Many initializer's are pre-C99 style, and
more importantly there is no distinction between a list element and a
list head.  To work with list macros the head has to be initialized
correctly.  It is better not to worry about changing the interface and
avoid having to change all the calling code.
The only advantage to the doubly-linked list (besides std macros) is
that it is possible to unregister without knowing the head. There was a
patch several months ago to do singly-linked list macros but it looks
like it never got accepted.  If the obscurity of the macro's is desired
then maybe the way to go is creating a slist.h with RCU extensions.

The use of notifier today is limited to things that can't sleep. As far
as I can tell, it is intended for system events like reboot, panic;
where sleeping doesn't make sense.  I think that is why the original
notifier_call_chain did not grab the read_lock.
