There's been a short series of patches (plus a short doc from James) to
deal with code that's already doing uid/euid capable() checks w/out a
corresponding LSM hook.  IOW, it's already been recognized as security
sensitive and has DAC check w/out corresponding MAC check.  It's a small
issue with relatively minor security impacts, but is completing
mediation.
