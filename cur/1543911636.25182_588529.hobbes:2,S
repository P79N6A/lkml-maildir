Frankly, we should hoist the per-cpu state into generic paravirt code,
get rid of the FLUSH "state" and only call the lazy_mode hooks when
actually entering or exiting a lazy mode.
The only reason lguest doesn't use a per-cpu var is that guests are
currently UP only.  If that were fixed, we'd have identical VMI, Xen and
lguest lazy state handing.
Cheers,
Rusty.
