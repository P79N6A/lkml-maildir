Let me add my cry to the clamor.  It works, it doesn't cause my K6 to
crash; I've experience no oopses with it.  In short my computer runs
just as well as, if not better than, it did before.  It's just a matter
of applying the patch, as far as I can tell.  So is there a reason why
Linus continues to put it off?
