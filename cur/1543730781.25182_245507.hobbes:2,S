Yes, you are right, but I am not sure Viro will go along with that..... ;-)

I don't object to b), though I think b) should wait for 2.7 and reiser4 
should not.

Andrew, we need to compete with WinFS and Dominic Giampaolo's filesystem 
for Apple, and that means we need to put search engine and database 
functionality into the filesystem.  It takes 11 years of serious 
research to build a clean storage layer able to handle doing that.  
Reiser4 has done that, finally.  None of the other Linux filesystems 
have.  The next major release of ReiserFS is going to be bursting with 
semantic enhancements, because the prerequisites for them are in place 
now.  None of the other Linux filesystems have those prerequisites.  
They won't be able to keep up with the semantic enhancements.  This 
metafiles and file-directories stuff is actually fairly trivial stuff.
Look guys, in 1993 I anticipated the battle would be here, and I build 
the foundation for a defensive tower right at the spot MS and Apple are 
now maneuvering towards.  Help me get the next level on the tower before 
they get here.  It is one hell of a foundation, they won't be able to 
shake it, their trees are not as powerful.  Don't move reiser4 into vfs, 
use reiser4 as the vfs.  Don't write filesystems, write file plugins and 
disk format plugins and all the other kinds of plugins, and you won't be 
missing any expressive power that you really want....
Give Saveliev and I some credit.  10 years of hard work at an ivory 
tower nobody thought mattered.  Now the battle leaves the browser and 
swings our way.  Don't duplicate that infrastructure, use it. 
There is so much we could use help with if talented people like you 
chose to contribute.

Well, I agree that there is value in defining things in more detail than
