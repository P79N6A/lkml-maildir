Alas, it doesn't quite work as we'd like:
akpm-1:/home/akpm> cat a.c
int a;
main()
{}
akpm-1:/home/akpm> cat b.c
extern char a;
int b()
{return a;}
akpm-1:/home/akpm> gcc -fno-common -Wl,--warn-common a.c b.c
akpm-1:/home/akpm> 
No warnings emitted.  If b.c doesn't use `extern' it will fail
to link because of -fno-common.
What we'd *like* to happen is for the linker to determine that
the `extern char' and the `int' declarations are a mismatch.
Maybe the object file doesn't have the size info for `extern'
variables.   The compiler emits it though.
We can actually get what we want by disabling `-fno-common' and enabling
`--warn-common', but that's rather awkward. 
Perhaps HJ can suggest a solution?
