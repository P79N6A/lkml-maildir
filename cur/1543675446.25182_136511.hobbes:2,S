I have Asus A7N8X deluxe too, and I reported this issue with rc4.
I'm running one IBM vancouver2 180gxp drive on SIL3112A, and I always have
PIO on boot.
I can enable DMA manually and it works good, but I can bet if I connect
second hdd in RAID
with this I already have, I'll get all problems described above!!! My friend
also runs succesfully ONE
hdd in DMA on the same ASUS on sata, but connecting seconf drive blows
everything away..
