Nope.  For $12K you can get
	4x 1.9Ghz
	512MB
	No networking
	1 disk
	No operating system
That's as cheap as it gets.  And I don't know about you, but I have a
tough time believing that anyone buys a 4 CPU box without an OS, without
networking, with .5GB of ram, and with one disk.
If you think you are getting a realistic 4 CPU server for $9K from
a vendor, you're dreaming.
