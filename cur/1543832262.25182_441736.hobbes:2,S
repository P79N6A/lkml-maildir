This is _totally_ incorrect. Your "lock" functions are broken, because 
they do not introduce syncronization points or locked bus operations. Due 
to this huge failure, the compiler and/or processor is free to re-order 
your loads and stores, resulting in totally unpredictable runtime 
behavior.

...which indicates that your code is wrong.

Actually, it's not. It's never setting "mtx" to 1, and it's certainly not 
doing any sync or locked ops.

Yes, you got it wrong, and the current code gets it right. (Linus's patch 
of =m to +m, combined with -volatile, is best)

NO! It's not better. You're still not syncing or locking the bus! If you 
refer to the fact that the "movl $1" has magically appeared, that's 
because you've just PAPERED OVER THE PROBLEM WITH "volatile", which is 
_exactly_ what Linus is telling you NOT TO DO.

No.
