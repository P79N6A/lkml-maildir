Subject: [PATCH] 2.3.40: <linux/linkage.h> doesn't generate correct cache  alignments for 486 and above
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/1/27/3

On inspection <linux/linkage.h> handles the i686 incorrectly.
Cache line alignments are being set to 4 bytes as per the i386.
This is a bad bad thing for the i686.
However, it is much worse than this. __i386__ is always defined.
BTW, I am running gcc 2.95.1 and I don't have the stomach to
track down where, but __i386__ is always defined for x86.
The patch strips out dependancies on __i*86__ and uses a
combination of CONFIG_X86 and and CONFIG_M386.
I would *strongly* advocate cleansing the kernel of all uses of:
        __WorksWithMyCompilerTodayDoesItWorkWithYours__
And I don't want to hear about Linux being written in gcc.
It is one thing to use gcc as a compiler/code-generator, and
quite another to use it as a configuration management system.
