HDIO_GETGEO returns 4 fields.
There is unsigned long start; giving the starting cylinder
of a partition. It is valid, and there is some software that
uses it. It will work until the disks get larger than 2 TB
(that is, today).
And there are heads, sectors, cylinders.
This is mostly garbage. Naive use is not recommended.
Semantics in 2.0 / 2.2 / 2.4 / 2.6 all different.

Not recommended.
