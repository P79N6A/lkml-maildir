I have eepro100's on other systems and never had a problem.  They
never have been made to work as hard as the DELLs though.  I am
trying the same DELL with a 3C996-T 1000Bt card using the driver from
3COM (we plan on moving that system to a 1000Bt system but the switch
hasn't arrived yet) and it is running at 100Bt with the same
software.  If you don't hear form me assume it surrived.  Been up a
day so far, took the DELL like 3 days of heavy use to crash before.
