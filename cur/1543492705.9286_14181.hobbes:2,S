Doesn't work for me, though. Machine is an AlphaStation 250 4/266. xntpd
starts up fine, but very frequently loses sync. To make the problem
worse, running xntpd also has an impact on nanosleep(). "sleep 1" tends
to block for much more than a second, and icecast's "shout" frequently
produces gaps. Without xntpd all is fine.
