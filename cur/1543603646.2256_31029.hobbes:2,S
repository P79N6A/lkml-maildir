This happened with linux-2.4.11-pre3-xfs on a debian woody K6-III/500 with
512 MB RAM.
I was downloading a ISO image, md5summing another while browsing the web 
and md5sum core dumped. I started another and a top and then I saw kswapd 
being defunct. The box oopsed a little later and when I get home I will post
the oops.
This is my third oops this day. Before that I had linux-2.4.10-xfs with an
uptime of 6 days.
