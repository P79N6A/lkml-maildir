Check the documentation on the initrd (initial ramdisk) feature, it
allows a filesystem to be mounted at boot time, just before mounting the
'real' root, and do what you want with it.  (One place to find this is
the kernel: .../Documentation/initrd.txt)
Furthermore, you'll need to consult the documentation of your bootloader
(lilo, loadlin, syslinux, etc), to learn how it allows to specify this
"initrd" image.
Any more questions?
