>From your August 12, 2000 linuxdevices interview:
   RL: OK, so let's talk about the "infamous" RTLinux patent. What's up with 
   that patent?
   ...
   RL: Could that potentially be used to block RTAI from being LGPL?
   Yodaiken: RTLinux is released under the GPL. I have an agreement with 
   Linus that nobody who uses RTLinux with Linux will have to pay royalties.
My question: do you stand by this, at least?  If so, will you put that in 
writing for the rest of us?  Did you really mean what you said, or did you 
add conditions later, such as 'only unmodified RTLinux blessed by me'?  If 
not, then I should be able to backport most RTAI features to RTLinux and call 
the result RTLinux.  Would that be consistent with your agreement with Linus?
