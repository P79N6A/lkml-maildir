Well it should help a bad case application by about 2x by doing this.
It will very roughly change efficiency of a streaming IO vs other IO
from 80% to 60% which is going too far for a default IMO. A better
idea would be to do the exec prefaulting you had in your tree...
Oh, and the process scheduler can definitely be a contributing factor.
Even if it looks like your process is getting enough cpu, if your
process doesn't get woken in less than 5ms after its read completes,
then AS will give up waiting for it.

I did send one to you but not in patch form so I guess you were a
bit lazy with it! I guess I'll be doing this autotuning thing soon
so it is going to change.
