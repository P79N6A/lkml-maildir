it's not really the microbenchmarks that matter (although they obviously 
are part of the picture), but actual application performance. There are 
dozens of workloads that matter. Kernel compilation timings are an 
obvious priority :-), but there are other things like SPECsdet, STREAM, 
dbt3-pgsql, kernbench, AIM7, various Java benchmarks and more.
now that scheduler changes have calmed down somewhat, we are mainly 
looking for regressions, and are checking schedstats output to see how 
'healthy' a given workload behaves.
