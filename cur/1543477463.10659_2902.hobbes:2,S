Yes, very much so.
When paging in binaries, you often have locality of reference in both
directions --- a set of functions compiled from a single source file
will occupy adjacent pages in VM, but you are as likely to call a
function at the end of the region first as one at the beginning.  It
is very common to get backwards locality as a result.
The big advantage of doing aligned clusters for readin is twofold:
first, it means that you get as much of a readahead advantage for
these backwards access patterns as for forward accesses.  Secondly, it
means that you are reading in complete tiles which are guaranteed to
have no gaps between them, so any two accesses in adjacent tiles are
sufficient to read in the complete set of nearby pages without missing
any gaps between them: it avoids having to do yet another IO to fill
in the few pages missed by a strictly forward-looking readahead
function.

I think this is the wrong solution: far better to do the patch below,
which simply exempts reads from nr_async_pages altogether.  I
originally added nr_async_pages to serve two functions: to allow
kswapd to determine how much memory it was already in the process of
freeing, and to act as a throttle on the number of write IOs submitted
when swapping.
We don't need a similar throttling action for reads, because every
place where we do VM readahead, each readahead IO cluster is followed
by a synchronous read on one page.  We don't throttle the async
readaheads on normal file IO, for example.
