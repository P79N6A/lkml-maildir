Why is this in the USB tree, and WHY THE HELL DOES IT EXIST IN THE FIRST 
PLACE?
Not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with USB, it's totally 
bogus and incorrect. The commit log is also non-sensical, since it points 
to a commit that doesn't even exist in that tree.
It causes
	drivers/ide/pci/amd74xx.c:77: error: PCI_DEVICE_ID_AMD_CS5536_IDE undeclared here (not in a function)
Grr.
That hwmon thing didn't seem to have anything to do with usb either.
