Hi,
What was/is the purpose of __ARCH_WANT_SYS_GETHOSTNAME?
and why do a few arches not #define it?
If it is not #defined, should those arches supply their own
sys_gethostname() function?
21 arches #define __ARCH_WANT_SYS_GETHOSTNAME.
A few don't:  frv, ia64, & xtensa.
But all arches (except for um) #define __NR_gethostname.
Is __ARCH_WANT_SYS_GETHOSTNAME just crufty and doesn't matter
any more?
Thanks,
