This doesn't make sense to me.
If a task is to run on the CPUs in both sets A and B, then it has to be
in both those cpusets, which isn't allowed, or in some super set of both
A and B (that is, in this example, in the top cpuset), which doesn't
restrict the task to just A or B or their union.
I have no idea what distinction you are seeing between what _cpus_ a task
can run on, and what cpuset it belongs to.
