Hello.
I have a clean 2.4.20 kernel.
I run "make menuconfig" but I can't see the "Frame-buffer support" section in 
"Console drivers" menu.
I can only compile the kernel without famebuffer support.It runs okay in text 
mode, but you know why FB support is needed.
Yes, I copied all the sources from tarball. Tried several times.
I tried to insert the lines from a standard config that add framebuffer 
support, but "make bzImage" returned an error at framebuffer font support.
Where did the frame-buffer section go?
What should I do to bring it back into config menu?
Thanks for any advise.
Artemio.
