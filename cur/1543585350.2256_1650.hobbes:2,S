Marcelo and me have been looking at this issue too, and have
come to almost the same conclusion as you, with one small
change.
We -need- to have a way to trigger the writeout of dirty
inodes under memory pressure. Imagine doing 'chown -R' on
a huge tree on a low-memory box; you'd end up with zillions
of dirty inodes in memory with no way to free them.
Now if prune_icache would write all the dirty inodes without
data pages to disk automatically, we'd have this issue fixed
and we'll be able to make a much more efficient prune_icache.
Anybody willing to give it a shot ?
regards,
Rik
