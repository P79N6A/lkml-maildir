A 1.5TB reiserfs3 volume takes long to mount. That's because it build the 
some bitmaps at mount time. Which means it (the kernel fs) requires more 
ram as your partitions grow. I only have one blurry experience value which 
is approximately 128MB per 1.9TB. Then you also need RAM for fsck...
Note that fsck'ing ext* filesystems also take their time, even when the 
filesystem is otherwise clean (e.g. mount count reached).
