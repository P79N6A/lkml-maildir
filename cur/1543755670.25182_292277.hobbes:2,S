Well, it is ok because the proprietary FS in question does not
access anything in the IDE layer.  The VFS does not reexport
ide symbols and interfaces.  It is not a "workaround" for proprietary
fs'es - someone who writes proper GPL code cannot simply take a shortcut,
skip the VFS layer and have his GPL'ed fs drive the IDE layer directly.
He'd end up with a stupid fs this way, one with artifical limitations such
as being unable to work on SCSI too, and unable to cooperate
properly with the VFS.
If skipping some GPL glue layer is possible, technically convenient, 
better for
performance but unfortunately illegal, then that is a strong hint that
the glue layer itself may be an illegal circumvention device.  In some 
countries,
at least.  The VFS however, is not a mere glue layer, it is an important
subsystem of its own.  Sitting between block devices and filesystems
makes it a middle-man of course, but it is much more than that.

There is another alternative, which is to provide open drivers.  The 
money is
in pushing _hardware_, not drivers!  And linux users are more likely to buy
the hardware device with the open driver, rather than the device with the
proprietary driver.  So this is good for sales too.  See the recent thread
about a open hw graphichs card.  Lots of people got interested, because of
the "no secrets - *fully* documented" approach.
Nobody really needs to be a "binary vendor".
