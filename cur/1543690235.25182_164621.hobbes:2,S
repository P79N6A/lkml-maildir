Subject: 2.4.22: UP+ACPI breaks 8139too [SMP or APM work fine]

hi all,
until recently i have been running a 2.4 SMP kernel on my UP boxes and 
getting along very well.  but i decided to test a UP kernel, and found 
that i couldn't access the network unless i replaced acpi support with 
apm.  my rtl8139 nic, using the 8139too driver, would give me NETDEV 
WATCHDOG: eth0 timed out over and over in the syslog.
can anyone help me?  i would love to get acpi working again, but i can't 
afford to lose the NIC.
thanks!
joe
