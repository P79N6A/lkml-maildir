Maybe. Well sure of things could be maybe important. Or maybe not.
Doesn't seem like a particularly strong case to add a lot of ugly
code though.

I'm not convinced of this at all. Most of these things proposed so far
can be done much simpler with 90% of the functionality (e.g. just swapoff
per process for migration) , and I haven't seen a clear rationale except
for lots of maybes that the missing 10% are worth all the complexity
you seem to plan to add.
