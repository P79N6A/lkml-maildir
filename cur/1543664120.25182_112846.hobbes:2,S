Since you have eliminated a lot of the hardware, I would check whether
the PSU is working correctly, if necessary by swapping in a spare one
for a day or two.
The easiest way to exercise the machine is probably to do kernel
compiles in a loop.  Memtest will exercise the memory, but not
particularly exercise the CPU.
