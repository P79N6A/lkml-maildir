Okay, the machine has been running for a whole day and a half now and
there is not a single stuck ftpd! So I think it is likely that this patch
did something positive in my instance.

I am still getting massive numbers of that message. The tcp_data message I
have not seen anymore which is odd, it was very frequent two days ago.
With the extra print outs that Andi asked for:
sending pkt_too_big to self totlen=1500,pmtu=576
sending pkt_too_big to self totlen=796,pmtu=296
sending pkt_too_big to self totlen=1500,pmtu=296
Thanks,
Jason
