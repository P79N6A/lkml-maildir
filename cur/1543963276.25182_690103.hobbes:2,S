Hello,
I have made a setup with four servers, where each server is configured
as follows:
* Four Intel Xeon E5130 CPU cores.
* 8 GB RAM.
* SCSI storage controller: LSI Logic / Symbios Logic SAS1068E
PCI-Express Fusion-MPT SAS (rev 04),
* 16 disks in a RAID6 setup (md).
* Linux 2.6.24.6 kernel.
There is a lot of data being written to the RAID6 array: about 50 MB/s
on each server. There are two kinds of messages that appear:
(1)
[74887.117650] mptbase: ioc0: LogInfo(0x31120403): Originator={PL},
Code={Abort}, SubCode(0x0403)
(2)
[74917.081454] mptscsih: ioc0: attempting task abort! (sc=ffff8100a18a7180)
[74917.081461] sd 0:0:15:0: [sdp] CDB: Write(10): 2a 00 1c fe 61 93 00 00 20 00
[74918.409801] mptbase: ioc0: LogInfo(0x31140000): Originator={PL},
Code={IO Executed}, SubCode(0x0000)
[74918.639801] mptscsih: ioc0: task abort: SUCCESS (sc=ffff8100a18a7180)
These messages appear a few times per day. Anyone any idea what the
meaning is of these messages and what the cause of these messages is ?
Bart.
