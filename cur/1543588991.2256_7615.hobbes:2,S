So you:
1. broke security (OK, fine...)
2. didn't remove all the support for security
It would be far more interesting to rip out all trace of security.
That would include the kernel memory access checking, parts of the
task struct, filesystem and VFS code, and surely much more.
Then you can try to show a measurable performance difference.
