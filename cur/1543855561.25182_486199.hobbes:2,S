That is a problem because the ranges must be registered with 
add_active_range() to work out how much real RAM is present.

It's possible that the containers people are interested in the possibility 
of setting up fake nodes as part of a memory controller.

Yes, there is nothing stopping you altering the early_node_map[] before 
free_area_init_node() initialises the node_mem_map. If you do hit a 
problem, it'll be because x86_64 allocates it's own node_mem_map with 
CONFIG_FLAT_NODE_MEM_MAP is set. Is that set when setting up fake nodes?
