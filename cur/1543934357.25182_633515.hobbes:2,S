Do you mean the comment? I had this code in kprobe_handler earlier and
it consistently exceeded 80 columns in my case. Will fix it anyways.

As you've also pointed out in your previous reply, this case is
peculiar and therefore I believe it should be marked as a BUG(). I've
left the original case, if (kcb->kprobe_status==KPROBE_HIT_SS) &&
(*p->ainsn.insn == BREAKPOINT_INSTRUCTION), untouched and is handled
as it was before. However, if (kcb->kprobe_status==KPROBE_HIT_SS) &&
!(*p->ainsn.insn == BREAKPOINT_INSTRUCTION), then instead of
incrementing nmissed count like before, it should cry out a BUG. This
is not an ordinary recursive probe handling case which should update
the nmissed count.

It may not get hit at runtime but is quite informative.

Agreed. I'll address this in another thread, but for now it is safest
to check it for all cases right at the entry of kprobe_handler().

Will get rid of that.

Hmm...there the are no deeply nested if-elses nor overlapping paths
which need to be avoided. All the nested checks unroll cleanly too.
