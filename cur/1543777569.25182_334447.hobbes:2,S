I'm perfectly happy having Linux optimize itself for the hardware
that it is running on.  However, the (harsh, I know) reality is that
systems with a reliable LAPIC timer in the face of C3 do not exist
today, and probably never will.  (don't shoot me, it wasn't my design
decision, I'm just the messenger:-)  Further, I expect that power saving
features, such as C3, will become more important and deployed more
widely in the future, rather than less widely.
So, the 13-year-old design advice will continue to apply to
13-year-old systems, but newer systems with C3 and HPET
should be using them.
