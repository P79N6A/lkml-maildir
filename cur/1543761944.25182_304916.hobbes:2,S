Yes it is. The main management is done by application so, if several
applications are listening for fork events you need to choose which one
will turn off the fork connector. 
I want to keep this turn on/off mechanism simple but if it's needed I
can manage the variable "cn_fork_enable" as a counter. Thus the callback
could be something like:
static void cn_fork_callback(void *data)
{
  int start; 
  struct cn_msg *msg = (struct cn_msg *)data;
  if (cn_already_initialized && (msg->len == sizeof(cn_fork_enable))) {
    memcpy(&start, msg->data, sizeof(cn_fork_enable));
    if (start)
      cn_fork_enable++;
    else
      cn_fork_enable > 0 ? cn_fork_enable-- : 0;
  }
}
What do you think about this implementation?
