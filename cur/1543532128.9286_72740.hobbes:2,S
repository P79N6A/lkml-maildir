So  the nonmanager threads do
          sigaction(n,s)
              === save local copy of s,n,thread_id 
                  real_sigaction(realprocessid(myid));
                  if unblocked a signal that is user_space pending
                     kill self with that signal
Now the information about who blocks what is available in user space
          kill(gettpid(),n)  where gettpid has been fixed to get the 
                             root pid
                             ===  find someone who is not blocking and 
                                  kill(someone,n)
                                  if all threads block, then mark signal
                                  as pending
