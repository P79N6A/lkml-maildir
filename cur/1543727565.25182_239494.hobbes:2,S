Whatever Roger found, plus:
1. trs == text RESIDENT size
2. drs == data RESIDENT size
3. memory-mapped devices should be counted for only 1 file
   (use an old Linux box running X to see)
I'm not terribly concerned right now. I just don't think
it's OK to go ripping out statm over a few bugs.
If we ripped out every buggy piece of kernel code, we'd
have a 0-byte kernel.
There are far bigger issues elsewhere, like %CPU.
