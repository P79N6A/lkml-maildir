Sadly enough, there is a soft reset command in the PS/2 protocol, and
the PS/2 interface is designed for hotplug, and because of that Linux
2.6 can easily handle hotplugging of both PS/2 keyboards and mice,
including type detection, etc, BUT the KVM switches don't use that,
because Windows historically doesn't support unplugging a PS/2 mouse.
The most ugly part of the KVM switch in this play is that while the KVM
switch usually implements a virtual mouse for each of the machines, it
lets them all talk to the real one, and if they have different ideas
about what mode the mouse should be set to, well, then there goes the
road to madness.
