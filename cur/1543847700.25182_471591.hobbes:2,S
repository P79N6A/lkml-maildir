No, it was not shown to break a single machine, and since the SCI bit was 
supposed to be on, it's a no-op on any non-broken hardware.

No. That would be silly.
Having _conditional_ code is not only bigger, it's orders of magnitude 
more complex and likely to break. It's much better to say: "We know at 
least one machine needs this" than it is to say "We know machine X needs 
this", because the latter has extra complexity that just doesn't buy you 
anything.
It's much better to treat everybody the same, if that works. That way, you 
don't have different code-paths.
