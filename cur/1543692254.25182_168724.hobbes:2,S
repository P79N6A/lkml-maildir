ok.

this is a testsuite bug i think - anonmap.c mprotanon.c differ in nothing 
but the name string of the test.

these are 'vulnerable' by design. There can be legitimate reasons to
mprotect() any of these regions. And if an attacker has enough control
over the target to execute mprotect() with precise arguments then the game
is mostly over anyway. Does anyone know the rationale of these mprotect()
tests?

it needs gcc level changes to change the stackframe layout - out of the
scope of exec-shield.

this is a variant of the mprotect() tests too - so possible by design.
