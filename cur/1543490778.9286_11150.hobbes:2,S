This is just a simple question I just don't have enough experience with
low level device drivers to get this done.
I have done work with msdos interrupt handlers but know I am switching
over to linux.  The program will compile fine but then when I insert it into
the kernel it says it can't find ioperm or outb or anything dealing with
io.  It does find the interrupt stuff though like probe_irq_on and
probe_irq_off.  I just use a normal gcc -c fname.c to compile and insmod
fname.o to insert the module.  I am trying to do one of the snipets of
code from the linux device drivers book by oreilly.
Any help is appreciated sorry I had to ask such a simple question but I
have no where else to turn to.
