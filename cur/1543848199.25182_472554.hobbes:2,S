I found another bug that "changes" randomly the "startline" value. I
spent a _lot_ of time checking what would be the smallest way to have
the work done without any problem.
If you remove 1 of the 2 nops (after _address()), you will get some
flickering on one of the controllers, about 15 times per minute. If
you remove both, the "evil" controller do worse things.
Really, I have been trying a lot of ways to improve it and find the
explanation of that weird changes, and the best algorithm I found it
the one I have sent. Dirty, but it works safely. I also tried with
different timings and delays, but they didn't work. The only way I
found is to make the LCD do such "nop" operations.
