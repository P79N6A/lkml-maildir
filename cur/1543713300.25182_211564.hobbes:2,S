tx_left counts packets submitted by hard_xmit_start to the hardware. 
Initially OWNbit is set, the packet is owned by the nic. The OWNbit is 
cleared by the hardware after the packet was sent. A packet with OWNbit 
set means that the nic didn't send it yet to the wire. I think the "else 
break;" patch is correct, but someone with docs should confirm that.
Adam: did you see deadlocks that disappeared after applying your patch? 
It shouldn't deadlock - it should loop until the nic sends the packet to 
the wire. It might take a few msecs, but then it should continue. 
Perhaps gcc optimized away the reload from memory and loops on a 
register. Or there is another bug that is hidden by your patch.
