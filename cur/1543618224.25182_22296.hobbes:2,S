Hi,
[please send answers also per mail]
I've uploaded a new version of the patch (2.4.18-pre4.2) which basically
includes a change to the serial port code by Juergen Beisert. This patch
should fix problems with systems that use interrupt sharing UARTs.
Latest stuff is as usual on
  
http://www.pengutronix.de/software/elan_en.html
Please test this extensively and report about your success.
I have another patch from Sven Geggus in the pipeline which makes it
possible to change the CPU's clock frequency on the fly. I would like to
integrate it but do not have a more-than-33-MHz Elan system available for
testing. If someone has a contact to a hardware supplyer who wants to send
me a board please tell me - SSV seems not to be cooperative here.
Other stuff waiting for integration:
- watchdog driver
- support for systems with external timer 0 clock source
- CS8900 bug ("transmission underflow")
Robert
