      ... because of buffer_req() is set from previous I/O, but
      flushpage() cleared uptodate (and mapped), but not req.
To follow up myself, after doing this change:

\End of patch
my system works again. I installed 98MB of debian packages and it looks
like that filesystem is OK. I do not know, whether it is best - I do not
understand, what BH_Req should mean, as no-one except fsync_dev/set_blocksize
clears it, if I did not miss something... But if fsync_dev clears
BH_Req, should not dropping buffer clear this too?!  But I can say
that I still do not understand this...
                                                Best regards,
