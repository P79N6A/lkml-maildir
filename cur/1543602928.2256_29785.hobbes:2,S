Hi,
Just checked out why my pppd hangs on exit
when the device is connected through USB
and found out that the reason was that the
code tried to change the linediscipline back
to what it was before ppd and that the ioctl()
hangs if the device doesn't exist any more as
the USB device has disappeared at that point.
Shouldn't the ioctl(TIOCSETD) return a ENODEV 
instead of hanging ?
The previous tcflush() does indeed do that and the
problem was then avoidable, but I think I just
fixed the symptoms, not the disease....
