Not sure what caused the increase from 2.6.0-test5 to 2.6.0-test6.
One noticeable thing - I get a noticeable speed increase if I turn off
rendering to the screen, so that it only goes to a file. I don't get
that speed improvement in 2.5.65 - only in 2.6.0-test5 and 2.6.0-test6
test5 goes from 20 mins to about 15 mins (the same speed as 2.5.65 with
or without screen rendering)
test6 goes from 30 mins to 24 mins - still worse than test5 by a lot.
