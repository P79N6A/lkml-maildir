There should _not_ be other things in the patch aside from the
scheduler.  Those patches are based on Ingo's original 2.4 patches with
back-ported fixes from 2.4-ac and 2.5.  Unfortunately, at the moment the
patch is a bit out of sync.  The only 2.4 version of the scheduler I
have been able to keep up-to-date is 2.4-ac... but the patch is not too
bad.
I think the reason my patches differ from Ingo's is that Ingo includes
code that is not yet in mainline 2.5.  For example, last I checked his
patches had the SCHED_BATCH stuff, which is good, but I only want to put
code that is in 2.5 already and tested.
