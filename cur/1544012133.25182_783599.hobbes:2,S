You're still not getting it. Consider an implementation of the chained
interrupt handler like this:
static struct ipu_irq_bank irq_bank_fn[IPU_IRQ_NR_FN_BANKS] = {
        {
                .nr_irqs        = 1,	/* IDMAC EOF and NF irq */
        }, {
                .nr_irqs        = 24,	/* misc interrupts the IPU is not
					 * interested in, but clients drivers
					 * may be.
					 */
        },
};
static struct ipu_irq_bank irq_bank_err[IPU_IRQ_NR_ERR_BANKS] = {
        /* 2 groups of error interrupts */
        {
                .nr_irqs        = 1,	/* IDMAC channel error irq */
        }, {
                .nr_irqs        = 17,	/* misc interrupts the IPU is not
                                         * interested in, but clients drivers
                                         * may be.
                                         */
        },
};
/* Chained IRQ handler for IPU error interrupt */
static void ipu_irq_err(unsigned int irq, struct irq_desc *desc)
{
        struct ipu *ipu = get_irq_data(irq);
        u32 status;
        int i, line;
	/* These interrupts are handled exclusively by the IPU code */
	if (ipu_read_reg(ipu, IPU_INT_STAT_4))
		generic_handle_irq(IPU_IRQ);
	status = ipu_read_reg(ipu, IPU_INT_STAT_5);
        while ((line = ffs(status))) {
                status &= ~(1UL << (line - 1));
                generic_handle_irq(irq_bank_err[i].irq_base + line - 1);
        }
}
/* Chained IRQ handler for IPU function interrupt */
static void ipu_irq_fn(unsigned int irq, struct irq_desc *desc)
{
        struct ipu *ipu = get_irq_data(irq);
        u32 status;
        int i, line;
        /* These interrupts are handled exclusively by the IPU code */
        if (ipu_read_reg(ipu, IPU_INT_STAT_1) || ipu_read_reg(ipu, IPU_INT_STAT_2))
                generic_handle_irq(IPU_ERR_IRQ);
        status = ipu_read_reg(ipu, IPU_INT_STAT_3);
        while ((line = ffs(status))) {
                status &= ~(1UL << (line - 1));
                generic_handle_irq(irq_bank_err[i].irq_base + line - 1);
        }
}
and in ipu_idmac.c:
request_irq(IPU_ERR_IRQ, &ipu_err_handler);
request_irq(IPU_IRQ, &ipu_irq);
That said I'm not sure whether we need a chained interrupt handler at all.
Looking at the remaining interrupts it seems that for example the
CSI_EOF (IPU_INT_STAT3 bit 5) interrupt is redundant to the corresponding
channels interrupt. In the camera driver you already realized that it's
the dma end event you're interested in, not the CSI_EOF event. Not sure
if that holds for the other interrupts though.
