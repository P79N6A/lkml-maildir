OK! I didn't even expect you should consult this with me. I'm simply
not used to see such enumerating with ";", unless in separate lines.
This could be only my problem of course...

I could only guess (it's a magic to me) - so, if it doesn't matter
"A data ..." begins this paragraph...

It seems logical, but it's also quite unusual, so the reader (only me?) 
could be more interested in orthography than in the subject...

Sure. But on the other hand such long questions probably are broken
somewhere with pauses when reading...

OK. But it's strange - usually I see too much "the".

I cannot even remember when I've inserted it. I thought only about "#' here.

I thought the "next" isn't synonymous enough, but OK.

I'll try to resend this yesterday with only agreed changes.
