This patch is a bad solution as it requires people to manually select
the uncached allocator. It should be enabled automatically by MSPEC,
not the other way round.
Given that MSPEC is clearly marked as depending on IA64, it seems bogus
for i386 allmodconfig to barf over it and the problem should be fixed
there instead IMHO.
