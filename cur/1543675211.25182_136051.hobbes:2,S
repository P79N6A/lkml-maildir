Yeah, it's minor compared to what *could* be (and probably is) broken.
I've got "CONFIG_LOGO=y" and "CONFIG_LOGO_LINUX_CLUT224=y" with VESA
framebuffer -- the same setup I've used successfully for many moons.
On the positive side, whatever broke in the 2.5.6X series that affected
my DHCP server has been fixed: my HP network printer thanks you :-).
Overall, 2.5.70 seems to be working fine for me other than the minor
matter of the logo at boot time.
