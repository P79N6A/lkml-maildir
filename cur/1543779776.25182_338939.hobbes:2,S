Just a few numbers:
I tried it on a Laptop (Dell C810, P3m 1133 mhz) and measured the power
usage with an external device and it stayed with or without patch at
27W. (HZ was at about 28)
On a desktop with AthlonXP with STOP activated i got a power usage of
57W with and without patch (without STOP activated 94W).
(HZ was about at 50)
