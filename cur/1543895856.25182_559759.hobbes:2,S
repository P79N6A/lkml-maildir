Yes. It should depend on:
 - speed of the device(s) in question
 - seekiness of the workload
 - wishes of the user as per the latency of other operations.
However, nobody has ever found the required algorithm.
So "at most 10% of memory dirty" is a simple (and fairly _good_) 
heuristic. Nobody has actually ever ended up complaining about the change 
from 40% -> 10%, and as far as I know this was the first report (and it's 
not so much because the change was bad, but because it showed up on a 
benchmark - and I don't think that actually says anythign about anything 
else then the behaviour of the benchmark itself)
So are there better algorithms in theory? Probably lots of them.
