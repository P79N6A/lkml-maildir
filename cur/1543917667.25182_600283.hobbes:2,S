I didn't need the serial - it crashes during console work too.
I think a "make clean" was in progress at the time. There must be work 
going on
in order to crash.
This time 2.6.22rc4 died on me with a general protection fault
I got two reports, the first one scrolled partially off screen but
the whole trace was there:
shrink_dcache_memory
shrink_slab
kswapd
autoremove_wake_function
thread_return
trace_hardirqs_on
kswapd
kswapd
kthtread
child_rip
restore_args
kthread
child_rip
Then I got:
spinlock lockup on cpu #0, kswapd 0/212
_raw_spin_lock
shrink_dcache_parent
shrink_dcache_parent
proc_flush_task
release_task
do_exit
die
error_exit
prune_dcache
[From here on, it continues exactly like the first report:]
shrink_dcache_memory
shrink_slab
kswapd
autoremove_wake_function
thread_return
trace_hardirqs_on
kswapd
kswapd
kthtread
child_rip
restore_args
kthread
child_rip
sysrq P says:
cpu 0
pid 212 comm: kswapd0  not tainted 2.6.22-rc4 #18
RIP: __delay
I took a picture of the screen, in case the register dumps are interesting.
Wonder what this is - dcache trouble? swap trouble?
