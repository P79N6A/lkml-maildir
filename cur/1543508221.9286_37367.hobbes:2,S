I guess that the leak occurs/increases only faster on machines 
running INN because innd uses huge amounts of memory when crunching the
newsspool/history-database, I can also provoke it by using
gimp for extensive pictures/scans, e.g. .
I have not seen this behaviour before, using kernel <= 2.2.10,
although my system has not changed at all.
