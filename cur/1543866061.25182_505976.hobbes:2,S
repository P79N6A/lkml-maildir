That is what I was thinking.

Well this is in a user space context called from user space and it
exactly matches the semantics we have now.  If we make it an
interruptible sleep the user space process shouldn't block.
I guess the other thing to do is do it in a non-block fashion
and just call schedule_work from the interrupt context when the
irq is disabled.  For i386 with it's in kernel irq scheduler
that might be better.
I think the nasty case is probably what do we do when it is
the timer interrupt we are dealing with.
Hmm.  I think I should look up what the rules are for
calling local_irq_enable when in interrupt context.  That
might be another way to satisfy this problem.
If local irqs are enabled I don't have to worry about the irr
register.
You've got me brainstorming now.
