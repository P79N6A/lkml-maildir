There are lots and lots of systems where Linux works.  Encouraging users
to buy hardware that works with Linux, can only help.  Encouraging them
that it doesn't matter and that binary-only drivers are a good
alternative, can only hurt.

Lots of people can and do use Linux without ANY binary drivers.   There
are Wireless choices that don't require binary only drivers.

Nobody is stopping anyone from using what "currently works", there will be
lots of like minded people to provide crap kernels and shitty binary
drivers to people who don't know better.   So don't worry, your well
intentioned vision of the future will survive the removal of 8K stacks
from the kernel.
