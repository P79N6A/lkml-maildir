The general case requires self modifying code.  Where do you need this in the
kernel.  For most callbacks the kernel is already passing a fairly generic
parameter you can use.  So this trick should be unnecessary.  
In general it would be better to modify what the kernel is passing the function
than to build up an infrastructure to avoid fixing the code.  Especially
as runtime generated code tends to have a performance penalty.
