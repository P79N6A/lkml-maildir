yes. Wake-one functionality has to be added piece by piece, accept() being
the most obvious example. Some other candidates: SysV semaphores, flock(),
maybe even pipes/fifos. The point is that the basic infrastructure has
been added in 2.3 (doubly-linked and cleaned up waitqueues, TASK_EXCLUSIVE
and an example user of the infrastructure: accept()), so the rest can be
added incrementally.
