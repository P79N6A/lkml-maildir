Oh, gpart is great, but if we had a backup copy of the partition table on 
every partition location on disk, then this backup copy could easily be 
reused to reconstruct the original partition table without further 
searching.  Just like the NetWare approach, and in some respect like the 
ext2/3 superblock backups.
