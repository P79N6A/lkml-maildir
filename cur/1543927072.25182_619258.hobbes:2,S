Please could you try which patch from the dm-crypt series cause this ?
(agk-dm-dm-crypt* names.)
I suspect agk-dm-dm-crypt-move-bio-submission-to-thread.patch because
there is one work struct used subsequently in two threads...
(io thread already started while crypt thread is processing lockdep_map
after calling f(work)...)
(btw these patches prepare dm-crypt for next patchset introducing 
async cryptoapi, so there should be no functional changes yet.)
