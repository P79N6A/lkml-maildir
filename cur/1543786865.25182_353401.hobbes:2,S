Does the following patch by John Stultz fix the problem?

Subject: [PATCH] x86-64: Fix bad assumption that dualcore cpus have synced
    TSCs
Andrew,
	This patch should resolve the issue seen in bugme bug #5105, where it
is assumed that dualcore x86_64 systems have synced TSCs. This is not
the case, and alternate timesources should be used instead.
For more details, see:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5105
Please consider for inclusion in your tree.
thanks
