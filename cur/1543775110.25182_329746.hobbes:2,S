I think it would make sense in theory to write protect them
together with the kernel code and the modules
(just to make root kit writing slightly harder)
It is just that it is not practical on i386/x86-64 right now
without undue performance impact for the main kernel. TLB pressure is 
unfortunately quite performance critical and we cannot goof off on this.
Write protecting the modules would be possible right now because 
they're vmalloced, but might be a problem later if we move them to the 
direct mapping again (that was a beneficial 2.4 optimization), so I am not sure
it would be a good idea.
BTW the kernel actually needs to write to code once
to apply alternative(), but it would't be a problem to use
a temporary mapping for this.

Well, it's the overriding issue here. Just pretending it's readonly
when it isn't doesn't seem useful.
