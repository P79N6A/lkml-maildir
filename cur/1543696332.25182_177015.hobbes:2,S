Well, it would be nice again to give credit for people who did this.
In fact that SGI let code slip in that clearly wasn't theirs I think you should
really identidy who changed what instead of a hude 1.4MB patch.
Comments to the patch:
	- don't reintroduce pciba, it's a broken driver and I removed it
	for a reason.  Use the generic pci procfs and sysfs infrastructure.
	- please handle OOM situation instead of BUG()ing.
	- please don't introduce empty functions just for the sake of it
	(e.g. per_ice_init)
	- the ioc4 driver is a mess, please rewrite it as a proper linux
	driver using serial_core, etc.. instead of glueing an irix driver
	through a midlyer directly to the tty interface.
	- please don't kill xbridge support from pcibr, we want to reuse
	it for the ip27 port soon
	- please kill the crap under PCI_HOTPLUG - that wants implementing
	as a proper linux hotplug pci driver instead.
	- msi support should go into generic code, not sn2-specific.  See
	the patches in Andrew's tree.
	- please use the generic pci-to-pci bridge code instead of reiplenting
	it.  Guy you drive me nuts with your silly hack it up on irix and
	glue it into linux strategy!
	- __HAVE_NEW_SCHEDULER is always true for 2.6, but you don't appear
	to actually use it..
	- the ifdefs in the tio code are broken, you dma mapping has zero
	chance to work for generic kernels
	- snia_if adds back the snia_pciio interface that were killed for
	a reason, don't do that!
	- you back out all changes to xswitch.c in 2.6, why?
all in all this patch is a big mess and it looks like you just took the
code from your tree and diffed vs what's in 2.6.  Please provide a patch
per thing, properly explained and reviewd.
