There are two ways I2O gets used - the first is to drive motherboard devices
the second is for card private stuff - like raid controllers. So it should
work fine without that support - check with them. The idea is you would
have the I2O controller driving the ARO 1130.

Not that I know of but if there is an I2O device driver module for it then
you might be in luck 8)

USB is far from finished but the USB people had a (small number of) clues.
There are only two standard interfaces for USB chips on a PC

The lm78 driver can probably handle this
