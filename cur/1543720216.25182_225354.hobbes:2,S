So do it in the caller, e.g..
int copy_cpus_to_user32(const u32 __user *ubuf, cpumask_t cpus)
{
	int i, ret, len = ALIGN(NR_CPUS, 32)/(32/sizeof(u32));
	u32 *ary = kmalloc(sizeof(cpumask_t), GFP_KERNEL);
	if (!ary)
		return -ENOMEM;
	cpus_to_u32_array(ary, cpus);
	ret = copy_to_user(ubuf, ary, len);
	kfree(ary);
	return ret;
}
int copy_cpus_from_user32(cpumask_t *cpus, const u32 __user *ubuf)
{
	int i, ret, len = ALIGN(NR_CPUS, 32)/(32/sizeof(u32));
	u32 *ary = kmalloc(sizeof(cpumask_t), GFP_KERNEL);
	if (!ary)
		return -ENOMEM;
	if (!(ret = copy_from_user(ary, ubuf, len)))
		cpus_from_u32_array(cpus, ary);
	kfree(ary);
	return ret;
}
or some such nonsense, or whatever someone can be arsed to consider a
better idea. One should note such a reformatting, as a user ABI change
in a stable series, would be unfriendly to 64-bit userspace on BE boxen.
i.e. do this only for 32-bit target userspace on 64-bit kernels + boxen.
