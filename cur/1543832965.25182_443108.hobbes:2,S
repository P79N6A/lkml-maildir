Yes.
Previous postings have explained the rationale,

The delay accounting part of the code is quite small (just a few
lines of timestamping code place in core kernel code) and much of the
remaining size comes from the interface. Since the interface is designed
to be of generic use towards ANY per-task accounting needs, discussions and
code have been fairly involved. We went through a long discussion of
potential exploiters:

Its part of the patches in Documentation/accounting/getdelays.c
and the last-but-one version of it can be viewed at its location in the -mm
tree:
http://www.linux-m32r.org/lxr/http/source/Documentation/accounting/?a=generic
(The just accepted patches updates the documentation especially the parts
relating to cpumasks but the above should also suffice to give a flavor of
what userspace could do).
