And the performance gains are not as obvious as one would hope, as
 there is some overhead caused by the WSD switch software
that transparently maps connections onto standard IP networks and SAN
boards depending on who you are talking to.
For some performance comparisions comparing WSD/native VI/TCP, there's
a paper called "WSDLite: a Lightweight Alternative to Windows Sockets Direct
Path", there's a link to the paper at 
http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/388853.html
(seems you have to use the Cached: links)
Providing a wrapper library for use with Infiniband and the current
SAN boards like WSD would probably be a useful exercise, but to really get
good performance (especially latency-wise) you probably want to use
something like MPI. For many applications a wrapper will be enough, though.
