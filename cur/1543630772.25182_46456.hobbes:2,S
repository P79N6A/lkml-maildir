Along the same lines, we have James Bottomly attempting to 
get support for the NCR Voyager architecture added to the
kernel.  His original submission post was sent 2001-12-23:

The latest submission attempt was sent 2002-05-11:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=102115570805131&w=2
It seems to me that adding a new architecture probably doesn't
impact the rest of the kernel much, so I am not sure way 
acceptance would be so long delayed.  I have noticed that 
there has been minimal feedback to James, which he appears
to have responded to quickly and well.  I tend to think
that any tweaks needed could be accomplished as easily once
the code has been accepted into the kernel tree.
Is there some justification for the delay that I have somehow
overlooked?
