That was what it used to be, at least among the advocates of GGI.  But
let's drop that particular flame war before it escalates. 
I've actually been very happy that I have _not_ seen that kind of
mentality lately apart from a minor hickup where somebody claimed that fb
cannot work together with X, and I very much want it to never ever develop
again.  Which is why I want to make sure that the FB drivers and XFree86
will work peacefully together, because anything else is just ridiculous
and stupid in the extreme.
