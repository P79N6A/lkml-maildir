Actually, this is wrong.  The ext2 inode limit is 2^32 512-byte sectors,
not 2^32 blocksize blocks.  Yes this is a wart and Ted wants to fix it, as
soon as we have something else important enough to require an incompatible
change to ext2.  As it is, we are limited to 2TB files for now, which is no
loss because we only support 2TB devices in 2.4 anyways.  When we change to
2^32 filesystem blocks, we will again be limited by indirect blocks, except
for 8kB block filesystems on Alpha/ia64 at 32TB.

+static loff_t ext2_max_size(int bits)
+{
+	loff_t res = EXT2_NDIR_BLOCKS;
+	res += 1LL << (bits-2);
+	res += 1LL << (2*(bits-2));
