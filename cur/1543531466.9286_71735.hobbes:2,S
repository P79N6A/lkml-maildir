Faster than UFS, maybe, but ext2 is about as fast as mfs.
The biggest speed improvement we can get is by writing
lazy-allocate code for the page cache, so that file data
doesn't ever hit the FS code when the file is temporary
and there's not much memory pressure.
And when there is memory pressure, what's wrong with using
a filesystem as backing store for files?
