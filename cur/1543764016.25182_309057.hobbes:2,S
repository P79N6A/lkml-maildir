I really don't see the point you are trying to argue. I said, sure it is
possible to make it a separate module, that is what my initial
implementation was. Why do you want to pigeon-hole it with anything but
the existing firmware loading code?
It is _not_ usb-serial specific, in fact once the device is initialized
this isn't even needed. And the initialization as far as I can see uses
little or no usb-serial code.
It happens that many usb-serial devices are built around the ezusb
chipset, which in turn seems to be a 8051-based microcontroller. The
compilers for such microcontrollers seem to generate IHEX formatted
output possibly because eprom burners generally support the format.

What? I find the existing request_firmware fairly simple and
straightforward, it has a very KISS-like quality to it, it is nice and
small and even the userspace support is trivial. I only saw a mention
about 'replacing' it in the current thread which mostly involved
complaints but didn't actually see anyone volunteering to start working
on such a replacement.
If a driver wants to load 5 different chunks, just call request_firmware
5 times (i.e. drivers/bluetooth/bcm203x.c). If the data is a single
binary blob, just ask for the single binary blob. In this case there
seems to be some structure to the blob that I wanted to preserve, and
that would either be some custom binary format that contains
[<address><length><data>]... tuples, which ofcourse causes problems for
our big-endian brothers, or a similar ascii format, where the IHEX is
not only pretty much standardized, it is trivial to parse and even adds
checksum information.
The only thing that I see missing right now is a change to the makefiles
to have in-tree firmware files get installed in /lib/modules/`uname
-r`/firmware or some similar place. Ideally people would add a line
like,
    fw-$(CONFIG_FOO) = foo-firmware-blob.fw
And make install could drop it a place where hotplug can find it.
