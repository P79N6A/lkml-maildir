I don't know about that, but I had another version of this patch
that removed the use of __setup() and just used the module_param()
that is already there (but with the param renamed to "time" and
changed to a bool), so that the usage on the command line is:
  linux printk.time=<bool>
I like this alternate version pretty well, but it causes more
change and a usage that is not well-known.  Patch is below.
The __setup() declaration and its function helper are not removed
yet, but they could be, and just leave the value-setting job
to the module_param() code.  All tested.

Allow printk_time to be enabled or disabled at boot time.
Previously it could be enabled only, but not disabled.
Change printk_time from an int to a bool since that's what it is.
Make its logical (exposed) name just be "time".
Note:  Changes kernel boot option syntax from "time" to "time=value".
Since printk_time is declared as a module_param, it can also be
changed at run-time by modifying
  /sys/module/printk/parameters/time
to a value of 1/Y/y to enabled it or 0/N/n to disable it.
Since printk_time is declared as a module_param, its value can also
be set at boot-time by using
  linux printk.time=<bool>
If we are willing to drop the shorter "time=value" syntax, we could
also drop the entire printk_time_setup() function and the __setup()
for it.
