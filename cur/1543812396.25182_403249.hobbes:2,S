I suspect you have some bug in your implementation. I think Dekker's 
algorithm depends on the reads and writes being ordered, and you don't 
seem to do that.
The thing is, you pretty much _have_ to be wrong, because the x86-64 
memory ordering rules are _exactly_ the same as for x86, and we've had 
that simple store as an unlock for a long long time.
