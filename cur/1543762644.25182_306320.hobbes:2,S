FWIW, I see the same thing here on some Dell Poweredge boxes:
serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
Serial: 8250/16550 driver $Revision: 1.90 $ 8 ports, IRQ sharing disabled
ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a NS16550A
ttyS1 at I/O 0x2f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
<garbage>
But intererstingly, on identical boxes, the garbage only appears on
those hooked up to a PortMaster device - those using a Cyclades never
display this problem. (???)
