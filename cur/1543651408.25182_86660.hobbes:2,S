This could be an argument _for_ doing it this way. As a sysadmin myself,
this makes a lot of sense to me, and being able to catch it by looking
in a 'mount' command is certainly a sweet proposal-- That way you can
constantly monitor anything that needs extra capabilities very simply.
And if mount supported an argument to ONLY show capability remounts,
there's a quick 'showcap' for you.
