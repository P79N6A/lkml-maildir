I thought your preference was to not do things differently from real 
hardware?  I guess this case you are okay with since you'd like to see 
the real hardware case follow eventually?
In any case, in paravirt the costs of reading timers and doing system 
call transitions are a bit different than on native, so we'll need to 
figure out what makes sense given those costs.

I think S390 maybe too.
