Arg --- typo in my reply.  I _meant_ to write "The block device layer
has a hard upper limit of 2GB.  It doesn't matter which block device you
use."  The point still stands: just using an LVM or MD device does
nothing to increase the maximum size of a block device, because all you
end up doing is creating another virtual block device.  If I have a RAID
cabinet pretending to be a single big SCSI device, then LVM cannot
possibly increase the upper limit on that device's size.

Because 2.2.1 was for critical bugfixes only; I'm queueing it for 2.2.2.
