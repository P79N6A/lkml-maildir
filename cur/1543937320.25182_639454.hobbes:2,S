It's very hard to do a per-thread counter in the VDSO, since threads
in the same process see the same memory, by definition.  You'd have to
have an array of counters and have some way for each thread to know
which entry to read.  Also you'd have to find space for tens or
hundreds of thousands of counters, since there can be that many
threads in a process sometimes.
