I strongly recommend running in UTC.
1. the system can then move between time zones without additional complexity
2. conversion errors during localtime -> system time don't occur
3. your clock doesn't get blown during system->localtime during shutdown
   (assuming you save system time...)
4. if you operate in a daylight saving time area, you won't get your clock
   blowin by variations in time depending on when you reboot.
