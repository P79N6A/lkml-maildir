Oh be real, there's no real difference between them and you know it.
It's all about where the bits are stored and what they tend to do in a
system design that makes the difference.  
This entire arguement is meaningless until someone posts the patches
to move firmware out of the kernel, and until I see that, it's not
worth re-hashing.   And no, I don't have the time or knowledge to do
this.
