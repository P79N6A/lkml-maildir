That's what I meant about working with existing modutils.  I can't think 
that anybody is excited about the extra work involved in supporting two 
modutils packages for years to come.
The backward compat thing is really a hack, and not system software done 
right :(  modutils should not need to rename all its binaries *.old -- 
and have that be the default that users see when installing the rpm.  No 
company worth its shareholders would release a package full of "*.old" 
binaries.  Come on...
If its politics that is preventing you from submitting modutils 
packages, then I encourage you to publicly post modutils patches, so 
that the early adopters, distros, and others can use those and have 
their existing systems continue to work seamlessly between 2.4 and 2.5. 
  Please?
foo.old is not a solution we want with us long-term... and booting into 
older kernels will be with us long-term.

Well, that more than satisfies my objection here, then.  Thanks.  I only 
saw ia32 modifications go into the kernel... I'm glad others have been 
tested, or at least played with, on multiple architectures.  I'm sure if 
rth doesn't tackle alpha module loading, Ivan or I will have it done :)
