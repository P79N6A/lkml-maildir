In linux (and most (all) unices) pending signals are checked
for on exit from the kernel so the order of operation is:
wake up (end of sleep) still in kernel
on exit from kernel, find signal, and deliver it, i.e. call
handler if there is one
on return from the handler, continue with the exit from the
system.
