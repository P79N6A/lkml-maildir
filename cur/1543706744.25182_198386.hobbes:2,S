I see the confusion - .devfsd gets created in the directory that is
/dev at the time devfs starts up.  However, after pivot_root, that directory
has a new name, and that's where we need to check for .devfsd.
It gets even more confusing in some configurations where we end up unmounting
/initrd/dev and then re-mounting /dev just to get it into the right place..
