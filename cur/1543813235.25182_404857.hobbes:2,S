I'll work it out.
Are we all happy with this patch now?
<looks at it>
Cosmetically, I don't think wait_on_prunes() should be concerned about
whether or not it "slept".  That action is not significant and preemptible
kernels can "sleep" at just about any stage.  So I think the concept of
"slept" in there should be replaced with, say, "prunes_remaining" or
something like that.  Consequently the all-important comment over
wait_on_prunes() should be updated to provide a bit more information about
the significance of its return value, please.
Also I think there should be some explanation somewhere which describes why
we can continue to assume that there aren't any prunes left to do after
wait_on_prunes() has dropped dcache_lock.  I mean, once you've dropped the
lock it's usually the case that anything which you examined while holding
that lock now becomes out-of-date and invalid.  I assume the thinking is
that because there's an unmount in progress, nothing can come in and add
new dentries?
IOW: why isn't there a race between wait_on_prunes() and prune_one_dentry()?
