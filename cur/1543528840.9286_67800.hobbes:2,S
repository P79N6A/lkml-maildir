(2.3.x ppp is probably not SMP safe anyway - it has bugs in it that are
 fixed in 2.2.15pre but not yet 2.3.x)

Take a look at the transmit interrupt handling in the serial.c code. The
irq code polls the THRE bit and if it indicates room it stuffs bytes down
the pipe
If the internal buffer is empty it wakes up a task queue on tq_serial. The
bh context code calls the ldisc wakeup
