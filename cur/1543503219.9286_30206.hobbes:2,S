i understand why a little readbehind can be effective in the random case,
and even have some experimental evidence that this is true. have you
measured this or do you have a study on it?  i'm not convinced that
significant amounts of readbehind are effective -- diminishing returns and
all that.  that's why i think quarter-cluster alignment is much better
than cluster-alignment.
plus, libraries aren't the only thing that are mapped.  what would the
best readaround strategy be for a mapped randomly accessed sleepycat index
file, for instance?

yes, i've considered that.  but i'd like some discussion about what you
and everyone else here thinks would be interesting to try.  i know what
i'd like to try, but i'm a new kid.
