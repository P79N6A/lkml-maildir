When I'm porting win32 programs to linux i constantly run into thread
problems.
I can't use the same code for an massive threaded server that uses blocking
IO, the processes simply run out of resources. Even if I modify the count
with ulimit, I still run out of resources...
Is there some kind of patch for this?
