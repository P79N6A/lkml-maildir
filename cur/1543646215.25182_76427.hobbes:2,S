Not sure about that; DLT tapes are pretty bulky themselves; I think the
difference between say a set of 4 DLT tapes and a single Maxtor 320 in
caddy would be minimal. As for stored media, I think Maxtor are quoting
1M hours MTTF - (I hate to think how you measure such a figure) - for
the 320G, and that is probably longer than I'd trust either the tape or
the drive to survive.

Well to me there are two questions:
  1) Price with caddy/drive - especially when you need to have
	multiple backup sets.
	2) Linux serial/ata working reliably with hot swapping.
If both those came out on the right side then I'd happily swap to discs.
