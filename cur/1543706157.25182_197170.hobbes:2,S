Yes, this highlights a recent problem with CONFIG_HOTPLUG.  These 
markers were removed when the "add PCI ids to your table dynamically" 
patch was added in 2.5.x.  The patch didn't require CONFIG_HOTPLUG, and 
fun ensued.  This got fixed (IIRC), but also many drivers had their 
__devinitdata markers removed.  This is a fuzzy area where Greg loves to 
make the case for removing  CONFIG_HOTPLUG completely :)
