It is possible, you only have to remember that the file foo.c doesn't have 
to be called foo.c,v in the repository. SVN should be able to handle this, 
it's just lacking important merging mechanisms.
This is actually a key feature I want to see in a SCM system - the ability 
to keep multiple developments within the same repository. I want to pull 
other source tress into a branch and compare them with other branches and 
merge them into new branches.

I agree, what I was trying to say is that the SCCS format makes a few 
things more complex than they had to be.
