Well, frankly, recovery time of the DLM mostly will depend on the speed
of the membership algorithm and timings used. My gut feeling is that DLM
recovery time is small compared to membership event detection and the
necessary fencing operation.
But yes, scalability, at least roughly O(foo) guesstimates, for numbers
of locks and/or number of nodes would be helpful, both for a) speed, but
also b) number of network messages involved, for recovery and lock
acquisition.
Mark, do you have the data you ask for for OCFS2's DLM?
(BTW, trimming quotes is considered polite on LKML.)
