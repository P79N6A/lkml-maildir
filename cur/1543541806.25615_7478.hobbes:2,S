Subject: 384MB RAM don't work on VIA MVP3

I have a Tyan Trinity 100AT with VIA MVP3. It has an AMD K6-II and 384MB
(3x128) ECC SDRAM and have _never_ failed with Windows-95. Linux
2.4.0-test6 detects memory size correct (2.0.38 and 2.2.16 fails
detection), the system comes up appearently as it shall, but after some
use it locks up responding to nothing but hardware reset. With only 128
or 256 MB physically installed it appears to work, the earlier kernels
failed even with the reduced memory.
Maybe this can give any lead: Wndows 3.11 refuses to boot, complainging
over 'PageOverCommit' that it says shall be set to 4 or less.
The memory is Samsung PC100 running at 66MHz and the CPU is a 500MHz
running at 400MHz (66*6). Graphic card is a Matrox Millennium G400 max. 
 Thanks in advance for any assistance, best regards /Haakan
