I'm struggling to understand what your card does then.  From this, it sounds 
like a standard network card that just happens to use IB physicals.  Do you just 
send raw packets?  How is the LRH formatted by your card?  I.e. what's setting 
up the dlid, slid, vl, etc.?  Can your card interoperate with other IB devices 
on the network when running in this mode?
