That depends on what we would like to support.  For example, we may need to use
the same kernel for the suspend-to-disk-and-RAM feature.

We can write to a swap file and Nigel can write to a nonswap file too.
Plus if we use swap for hibernation, we need to know which swap pages have been
allocated for normal use by the kernel.

Well, my experience shows that you need to do everything yourself up to a
certain point.

I don't agree.  You need to think of many limitations in advance, because
they need to be taken into consideration in the design.
Otherwise we'll end up with something that will need to be bandaided like the
freezer. :-)
