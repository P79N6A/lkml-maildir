don't care really.  If we're allocating a page for an address_space, we
should be using its allocation mask.  As I said, we might add more things in
the future.
If in so doing the user pointlessly wastes some CPU cycles in one weird
case, it doesn't matter a lot.

ug.  That's special-casing the blockdev pagecache peculiarity when someone
mmaps it.  It'd be better to stick with the existing interfaces and
conventions: the address_space gets to dictate how is pages are allocated.

mapping_gfp_mask if a pretty foul thing.  Adding
	struct page (*alloc_page)(struct address_space *mapping);
to address_space_operations would be a quite nice cleanup.
But I ain't taking cleanups at present.
