This is an unfortunate side-effect. Following snippet from
scripts/Makfile.build explains it:
# We would rather have a list of rules like
# 	foo.o: $(foo-objs)
# but that's not so easy, so we rather make all composite objects depend
# on the set of all their parts
$(multi-used-y) : %.o: $(multi-objs-y) FORCE
	$(call if_changed,link_multi-y)
The problem is that we have no easy way to say that this specific
module depends on this list of .o files.
With make 3.81 this would be possible utilising $(eval ...),
but the benefit is too low to introduce such a dependency.

You could do:
make drivers/media/video/zr36067.ko
to avoid linking the others.
But kbuild will unfortunately link to much modules for a normal build.
One day I may try to generate one big Makefile and then it could
be addressed but I have yet to find 'the' reason to invest time in that
task.
