  Besides of the referral to domestic cleaning agent..
  The "mrproper" tag is being used all over the place
  to remove most of configuration and compilation related
  files.
  "distclean" calls at first "mrproper", and then does some
  additional cleanups, like various editor backup files.
  Thus "distclean" does more than "mrproper".
  Deeper understanding is available to those who read the top-level
  "Makefile" file.  ;-)   (Presuming they understand  makefile.)
