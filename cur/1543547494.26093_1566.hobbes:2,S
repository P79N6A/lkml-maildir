Can hundreds of people write Linux kernel code without significant
difficulty? YES. Can Jeff Merkey be forced out of the pool without
pissing in it first? Apparently not.
If your company lacks the skill set needed to do Linux programming, then
it's good that you are refocusing. However, I think it's shameful that
your organization is completely incapable of behaving maturely, and not
burning it's bridges. The tone of your statements makes it obvious you are
trying to slander Linux to draw attention away from your own failings.
When I read your announcement, I was shocked. I thought you had learned
not to drink-and-post and you'd stopped being such a jerk on l-k,
apparently I was just not paying attention. I highly doubt the world needs
another Netware, and I doubt a group with the level of maturity
you've demonstrated could even pull it off, but I wish you luck.
