Andrew - please use time based rate limits for this sort of thing, that
way you actually get to see who is actually using it. Probably doesn't
matter for the FUTEX_FD case as nobody does, but in general the 'ten
times during boot' approach is not as good as ratelimit(): Perhaps
net_ratelimit() ought to become more general ?
