I really would like all volatile users to go away and be replaced
by explicit barriers. It makes things nicer and more explicit... for
atomic_t type there probably aren't many optimisations that can be
made which volatile would disallow (in actual kernel code), but for
others (eg. bitops, maybe atomic ops in UP kernels), there would be.
Maybe it is the safe way to go, but it does obscure cases where there
is a real need for barriers.
Many atomic operations are allowed to be reordered between CPUs, so
I don't have a good idea for the rationale to order them within the
CPU (also loads and stores to long and ptr types are not ordered like
this, although we do consider those to be atomic operations too).
barrier() in a way is like enforcing sequential memory ordering
between process and interrupt context, wheras volatile is just
enforcing coherency of a single memory location (and as such is
cheaper).
What do you think of this crazy idea?
/* Enforce a compiler barrier for only operations to location X.
  * Call multiple times to provide an ordering between multiple
  * memory locations. Other memory operations can be assumed by
  * the compiler to remain unchanged and may be reordered
  */
#define order(x) asm volatile("" : "+m" (x))
