According to the Single UNIX Specification:
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/poll.html
POLLIN means "Data other than high-priority data may be read without 
blocking. For STREAMS, this flag is set in revents even if the message 
is of zero length." The way I read it, all this is telling you is that a 
read on that file descriptor will not block at that particular moment. 
It doesn't mean there is actually any data to be read. On a device like 
a socket, read returning 0 tells you that the connection's been closed.
POLLHUP means "The device has been disconnected." This would obviously 
be appropriate for a device such as a serial line or TTY, etc. but for a 
socket it is less obvious that this return value is appropriate.

If you want nonblocking behavior, you should set the socket to 
nonblocking. This is a bit strange though, unless the data was stolen by 
another thread or something. Are you sure you've seen this?
