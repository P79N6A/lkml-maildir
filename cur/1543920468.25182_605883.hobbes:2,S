It looks like you misunderstood why a static lock protects open counts.
This is done so you do not need to worry about in-structure lock which
can be freed together with the structure. Look at this:

The dev->sem is entirely unnecessary here. Every time you use
open_count, it's protected by minor_table_mutex. The name is a litte
unfortunate, feel free to rename it.
This is probably a problem in 2.6 as well. I don't know why people keep
writing these things. Someone at Ontrak needs to look into it.
