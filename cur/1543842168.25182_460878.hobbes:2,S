Generally I don't think this is the right approach, as what you really
want to do is let the driver say "I want intelligent scheduling" or not.
The type of scheduler is policy that is left with the user, not the
driver.
And this patch seems to do two things, and you don't explain what the
pinning is useful for at all.
So that's 2 for 2 currently, NAK from me.
