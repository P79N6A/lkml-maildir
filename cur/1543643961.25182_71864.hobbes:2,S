I'm not so sure, but I'm not a developer,
just looking to the number:
> > 2.5.34.results:Average throughput : 62941 messages per second
> > 2.5.36.results:Average throughput : 60858 messages per second
2.5.34 and 2.5.36 have more or less the same performances... (2.5.34 is preemption ON, 2.5.36 is OFF)
There is an improovement in throughput in 2.5.3* against 2.4.*, and this is _good_ ;-)
