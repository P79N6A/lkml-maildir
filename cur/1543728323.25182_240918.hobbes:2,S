cdrtools do not have the problem as they do not include everything you need in 
order to copy CSS DVDs. Cdrtools however allow you to create UDF images from
DVD file trees and to write the UDF images to a DVD.
If ever, I believe that deCSS could be problematic although I believe that it 
may still be distributed from European sites.
