would be nice to base this on the GTOD patchset - that way you'll only 
have to modify kernel/time/*.c, not a gazillion of architectures...
i agree with your analysis - there is no reason calc_load() should be 
under xtime_lock. I guess no-one noticed this so far because calc_load() 
iterating over hundreds of CPUs isnt too common.
