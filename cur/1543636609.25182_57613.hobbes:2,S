I finally googled up a couple of threads that shed some light ...
Seems that page_address() will return 0 when used on a high mem entry
in the kiobuf maplist.
Looks like three (?) options: go back to copying to a kernel DMA
buffer for all cases (swell for performance), split the code path into
map_user and copy_user branches (not that fond of spaghetti),
or - in the highmem case - copy to a local buffer and populate the
kiobuf with those pages and feed that to pci_map_sg().
The last is my preference, as it keeps the code cleaner, and since
my hardware is scatter-gather, I can either build the local buffer out
of discrete pages (at load time) or allocate a (possibly) non-
contiguous kernel buffer.  I would prefer to not use kmalloc if
possible, since I don't really need contiguous pages, and would
like to keep the chances of allocation success as high as possible.
I haven't yet figured out how to allocate a (possibly) non-contiguous
buffer, since vmalloc is frowned on, or how to populate the kiobuf
with its pages.
Any advice gratefully accepted,
Bill
