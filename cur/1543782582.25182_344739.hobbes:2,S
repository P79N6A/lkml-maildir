Yes please, I don't understand why you would want a 0/1 interface
instead, when the timer-seconds method gives you the exact same ability
plus a way to control when to unfreeze...

Each drive has its own queue.

That includes things like the timer as well, reuse the queue plugging
timer as I described in my initial posting on how to implement this.

I fully agree with Bart here. The only stuff that should be ide special
is the actual command setup and completion check, since that is a
hardware property. libata will get a few little helpers for that as
well. The rest should be block layer implementation.

As per my previous mail, I will ack that bit.
