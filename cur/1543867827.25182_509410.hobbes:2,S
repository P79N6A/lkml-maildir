Why do you need four disks? Data and meda-data devices of DualFS can be on 
different disks, can be two partitions of the same disk, or can be two 
areas of the same partition. The important thing is that data and 
meta-data blocks are separated and that they are managed in different 
ways. Please, take a look at the presentation (see below).

No, we win for a wide range of common workloads. See the results in the

I think that the results sent by Sorin answer your question :-)
