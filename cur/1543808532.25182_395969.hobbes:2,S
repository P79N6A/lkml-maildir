Hrm BUG..
This version appears to work fine with the pages being added to the tail of 
the LRU, however there's a problem with the custom lru_cache_add_tail 
function. I end up hitting a bug at:
	if (!TestClearPageLRU(page))
		BUG();
in isolate_lru_pages called from shrink_zone, find_busiest_group, 
shrink_slab... ultimately from kswapd.
Just looking at the lru_cache_add function I note that my lru_cache_add_tail 
function is missing a page_cache_get on the page before adding it to the LRU. 
I'm guessing this is wrong.
Cheers,
Con
P.S. Sorry if this thread is getting long winded; there's a record amount of 
noise on lkml already :(
