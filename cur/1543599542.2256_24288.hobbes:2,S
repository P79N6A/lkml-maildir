Subject: [PATCH] blkgetsize64 ioctl

Hello,
The patch below reserves an ioctl for getting the size in blocks of a
device as a long long instead of long as the old ioctl did.  The patch for
this to e2fsprogs sneaked in a bit too early.  There is a conflict with
the ia64 get/set sector ioctls, but I that's less common than e2fsprogs.
