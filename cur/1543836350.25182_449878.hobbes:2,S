Subject: Userspace visible of 3 include/asm/ headers

Could anyone help me regarding the desired userspace visibility of the 
following three headers under include/asm/?
Header        : cpufeature.h
Architectures : i386, x86_64
Is there any reason why this header is exported to userspace?
Header        : setup.h
Architectures : i386, ia64, x86_64
Contents:
- COMMAND_LINE_SIZE on ia64, x86_64
- much more on i386
Should COMMAND_LINE_SIZE be visible to userspace?
Anything else from the i386 setup.h?
Header        : timex.h
Architectures : all architectures
Offers CLOCK_TICK_RATE on all architectures, but on some architectures
(like i386) this depends on the kernel configuration.
-> not a userspace header?
TIA
Adrian
