Someone posted a patch recently that showed that the cdrom layer
does it. Might be more. It is hard to audit a few million lines
of driver code.

It might be a subtle failure.
Maybe sparse could be taught to check for this if it happens
in a single function? (cc'ing Al who might have some thoughts
on this). Of course if it happens spread out over multiple
functions sparse wouldn't help neither.
