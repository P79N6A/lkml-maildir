That's the joy of free software: you're free to patch in any hack you
and your clients need.
The goal of the official 2.4.x kernel however should IMO be to follow
the specs which is what we do now.
If current Linux servers are broken w.r.t. NFS specs then a hack to
the Linux client won't fix them, and they will continue to break on
non-Linux clients.
NFS has a mechanism for solving this problem, and it is a mechanism
that most (if not all) non-linux servers implement. That is what we
need to implement too if we're serious about conforming to the
standard.
I'm quite willing to help fix the server (something I indeed think
should be done), but to further obscure the code in the client with
yet another bandaid for broken servers is not something I personally
will help do.
Perhaps Linus will indeed accept such a patch, in which case you (or
anybody else) are quite free to construct it and pass it on to him.
Cheers,
  Trond
