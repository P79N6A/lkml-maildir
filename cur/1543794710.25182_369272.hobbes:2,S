That's correct.

No, I'm not running with idle=poll right now.

Well, I could try but it is not a solution I could use. It would turn
all my machines into space heaters 24x7, no sense in doing that :-)
I got an answer off the list from John (Stultz) in response to the dmesg
output I sent him and he suggested I try idle=poll (which I briefly did
last week) and also changing:
  /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/clocksource
to acpi_pm, which I just did. It is too early to tell re: keyboard
repeats and screensaver false triggers, but it did fix the problems I
was seeing with a hacked Jack that is using gettimeofday instead of tsc
reads. Meaning, Jack with gettimeofday + tsc timing source has problems,
Jack with gettimeofday + acpi_pm does not. It would seem gettimeofday is
not working correctly with tsc.

I will and report back.
Thanks.
