So we would already have something that could be extended.
BTW, my IRQ statement was misplaced since this is the very thing we're
caring about: de-idle activation latency right after hardware IRQ occurred.
IOW, an idle callback really could be useful, since it does
positively work against the buffer servicing IRQ wakeup latency issue.
Another question is how one would do callback processing in idle handler:
one could figure out the idle mode (latency) in advance and *then* call
only all those idle callbacks that have more stringent requirements
than the currently calculated idle mode's latency (and then calculate
the idle mode again based on the current time after all those callbacks??),
or one could just unconditionally call all idle handlers and then figure out
idle length and go to sleep. Which one is better?
