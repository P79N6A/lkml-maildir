Subject: PROBLEM: blank boot screen on linux-2.6.0-test4 (with workaround)

I upgraded a working Redhat 9 installation (linux-2.4.20) to
linux-2.6.0-test4. When I boot, I see the "Uncompressing Linux..." message,
but then the screen goes blank. I know the system did not crash because I
can blindly login and shutdown.
My previous kernel boot parameters included "vga=773" to give me 50 lines on
my laptop display (a Dell Latitude C400). If I remove "vga=773" and add
"video=vga16:off", then everything works correctly! If I include both
"vga=773 video=vga16:off", then I get the blank boot screen again.
Why does "vga=773" work with linux-2.4.20, but not linux-2.60-test4? Why
does linux-2.6.0-test4 require "video=vga16:off", but linux-2.4.20 does not?
thanks,
chris
