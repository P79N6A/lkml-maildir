It is possible to make it a bit of a snooping effort. For example,
encrypt individual files FYEO with a public key, then require a
viewer application with which to read them.  The viewer needs the
private key. Root has to snoop the session to find it. 
Do it remotely and you're OK. I.e. encrypt a file (in which there
is a file system) and export it by NBD to a viewing machine, which
mounts the decrypted system. This is 100% secure. I think I can do
that ..
