Subject: [patch v2 1/1] md: Software Raid autodetect dev list not array
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Michael J. Evans <mjevans1983@gmail.com>
In current release kernels the md module (Software RAID) uses a static array
 (dev_t[128]) to store partition/device info temporarily for autostart.
This patch replaces that static array with a list.

Version 2: Following Neil Brown's requests...
using list_add_tail, and corrected missing i_passed++;.
removed sections of code that would never be reached.
- -
The data/structures are only used within md.c, and very close together.
However I wonder if the structural information shouldn't go in to...
../../include/linux/raid/md_k.h instead.
I discovered this (and that the devices are added as disks/partitions are
discovered at boot) while I was debugging why only one of my MD arrays would
come up whole, while all the others were short a disk.
I eventually discovered that it was enumerating through all of 9 of my 11 hds
(2 had only 4 partitions apiece) while the other 9 have 15 partitions
(I wanted 64 per drive...). The last partition of the 8th drive in my 9 drive
raid 5 sets wasn't added, thus making the final md array short both a parity
and data disk, and it was started later, elsewhere.

12: Has been tested with CONFIG_PREEMPT, CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT,
    CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB, CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC, CONFIG_DEBUG_MUTEXES,
    CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK, CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP all simultaneously
    enabled.
It has been tested with CONFIG_SMP set and unset (Different x86_64 systems).
It has been tested with CONFIG_PREEMPT set and unset (same system).
CONFIG_LBD isn't even an option in my .config file.
Note: between 2.6.22 and 2.6.23-rc3-git5
                rdev = md_import_device(dev,0, 0);
became
                rdev = md_import_device(dev,0, 90);
So the patch has been edited to patch around that line. (might be fuzzy)
