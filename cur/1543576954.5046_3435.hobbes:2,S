Subject: 2.4.0-testX fails to compile on my Athlon
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I've looked for answers to this question before, but all I could find was
someone asking a similar question and no replies...
I'm having great trouble getting 2.4.0-testX to compile on my system when
I select Athlon/K7 as the Processor Family....
I've attached below the error's I'm getting.... the kernel DOES compile if
I select anything else... but I don't have anything else :)
gcc version = 2.95.2
GNU Make version 3.79.1
GNU ld version 2.9.1 (with BFD 2.9.1.0.25)
fdformat from util-linux-2.10o
insmod version 2.3.21
I'd hope someone has an answer on how to fix this
Matt Wright
