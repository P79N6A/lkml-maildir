Understood.  The only dangerous change I know of in the VP patches is
the one Alan took issue with, the aforementioned removal of lock_kernel
in the tty code.  IIRC this only produced a latency of about 300 usecs,
and only when switching VT's from a console to X and back.  My point was
that it's quite possible that we can get OSX-like results without the
more dangerous changes.
Ingo, if you want to send me a patch set without the more controversial
changes, I can compare the performance.  A diff against the latest VP
patch would be OK.
