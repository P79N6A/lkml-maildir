As a bonus, even genuine serial ports may be in undefined state after
resume. I'm unfortunate enough to have a brand new notebook with
serial port, but the serial console code will print garbage after
resume until I do a
echo foo >/dev/ttyS0
I've already sent mail to linux-serial for that problem, but the
list appears to be dead. Any pointers to the right contact would
be appreciated.
