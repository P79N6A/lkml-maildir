Hy there,
	hey guys, look:
here I got an mother with onboard sound, it has an essolo-1, which is
gret supported in the 2.3 kernel version (even 2.2.13 doesn't do it
well). So I got the 2.3.25 kernel (I'm getting .27 now.....) and
compiled it. I could compile everything fine, but I've noticed that my
/lib/modules/2.3.25 does not have all modules (2.2.12 has all. it is
about 7mb). I has just compile the modules I've asked (from fs, vfat and
msdos, and from net, ppp_generic and stuff).
But and if I want to load some other modules later? I would I do? I
couldn't find also anything about moduling my ethernet board, its an
ne2000 (but ISA). There's just how to compile for ne2k-pci (which is
also auto-detected, but which I don't have.....)
