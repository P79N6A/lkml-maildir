Well firstly you should think very hard before trying this because most
operations will be filled from cache and many file systems dont have
constant block numbering - NFS for example. Block numbers may also be in
a logical not physical space so not relate to the media.
To answer the detail question. Several parts of the linux system do 
insufficient checking for FIBMAP currently to be user accessible.
