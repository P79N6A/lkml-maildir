	It seems to fix it on my setup.  It did introduce problems booting
(complete hang after the uncompressing kernel... line) that can
temporarily be worked around by specifying    mem=XXm on the LILO command
line, where XX is the largest multiple of 2 or 4 that fits in your actual
memory.  You may not see this problem if your memory already is an even
multiple of 4M.
	I've been using 2.3.28+K4 for 2 days without anything more than
the usual 2.3.x cosmetics nits.  I can deal with those; even this old P100
flies.
	Cheers,
	- Bill
