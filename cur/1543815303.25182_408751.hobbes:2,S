I read all the other messages, and still felt I needed to reply :).
This patch is correct. If a name ends in an s, the possessive form simply gets 
an apostrophe.
Plurals are irrelevant to the discussion, but I'll answer another part of the 
thread too. If you wanted to say that something belonged to Linus and his 
family, you'd still do Torvalds', and get the fact that Torvalds was in the 
plural from other words in the context (if possible).

Nigel
