You want to use rep movs for horizontals too as later x86 cpus will burst
those transfers. Its a win on non PC's in general to do equivalent writes
to screen over copies on screen because you dont stall the CPU waiting for
main memory reads (video memory is rarely in cache)

I think nanogui because it can be swapped (dropped out and repaged from flash
etc) and because the code can be shared that a user mode setup will be as
fast, more reliable and have a similar memory footprint to doing some of it
kernel side

Go for it. Several bits of Linux today exist because someone took twenty years
of "official wisdom" and decided it was crap.
