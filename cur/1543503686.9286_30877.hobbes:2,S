I have an Intel Xpress server based on 486dx2 (using a pentium chip replacement
from Kingston) and bugged Ingo Molnar once about smp not detecting anything.
After sending him some information he concluded Intel didn't keep to it's
own specification, and we gave up on it.
But this was some time ago. (also, my system doesn't have two cpu's anyway,
I was just chekcing to see if it was worth finding a cpu board for that thing)
I did notice weird things happen when you don't "certify" the bios data
with the EISA manager though. And in my bios there is an option to enable or
disable the io-apic.

      seem to run on 100mhz :( )
