Your memory is better than mine, not sure about the test program, but
there was at one point a scenario like that on Irix, and I quite
probably did mention it to you. That was certainly not PC hardware,
but more likely a large Irix system with multiple power busses spread
around a large amount of hardware. I presume you are saying that the fact
that ext3 journals complete inode blocks rather that subsections of inodes
means that, should a similar trashing of metadata occur during power down,
a journal replay would fix it?
I see no way short of hardware fixes of avoiding the general problem of
a system failing in an ugly manner like this. Unless you write everything
to disk twice (i.e. journal all data), you can still end up with a
legitimate set of metadata, and the master copy of your employee
database full of nasty little bits of corruption.
