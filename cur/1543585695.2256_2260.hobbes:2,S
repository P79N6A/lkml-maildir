Good idea, we should do this for 2.4.  I cannot remember
reading an email from you about this, it's quite possible
I just missed it and didn't answer because I never read

This can be considered a bug and should be fixed...

This could indeed be a problem, though I cannot really see any
case where a task would be in TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE permanently.
OTOH, a 1GB read() will take a (much) too long time to finish.
Your ideas sound really good, would you have the time to implement
them for 2.4 ?
