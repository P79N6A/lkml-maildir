The characteristics of the bus are not known. It could be anything
between 6 and about 16MHz. The way you read the bus clock is system
dependant.
The underlying problem is really that over time some of the hardware has
moved from the ISA world into the chipsets. That is why I sent Ingo the
patches for inb_pit/inb_pic and to split ISA 8390 and non ISA 8390
support. Someone has to tackle the CMOS but we are then in a position to
relegant port 0x80 timing use to ISA systems where it is fine.
