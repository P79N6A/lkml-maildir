Subject: [PATCH] smbfs: fix calculation of kernel_recvmsg size parameter in smb_receive
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/6/94

smb_receive calls kernel_recvmsg with a size that's the minimum of the
amount of buffer space in the kvec passed in or req->rq_rlen (which
represents the length of the response). This does not take into account
any response data that was read in an earlier pass through smb_receive.
If the first pass through smb_receive receives some but not all of the
response, then the next pass can call kernel_recvmsg with a size field
that's too big. kernel_recvmsg can overrun into the next response,
throwing off the alignment and making it unrecognizable.
This causes messages like this to pop up in the ring buffer:
smb_get_length: Invalid NBT packet, code=69
as well as other errors indicating that the response is unrecognizable.
Typically this is seen on a smbfs mount under heavy I/O.
This patch changes the code to use (req->rq_rlen - req->rq_bytes_recvd)
instead instead of just req->rq_rlen, since that should represent the
amount of unread data in the response.
