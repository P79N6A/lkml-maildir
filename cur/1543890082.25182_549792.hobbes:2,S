Uwe, you are an arrogant idiot and I think it's best
for everybody to just ignore all your mails, regardless
of their technical merits.
Even if your mail reports a real bug, added shitload of insults
to developers far outweights any possible useful info.
Developers can save a lot of time and nerver by just waiting for
someone else to hit the same bug, if it exists, and then debug it
as usual.
