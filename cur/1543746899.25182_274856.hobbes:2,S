    Me too, and a friend of mine too in a different server. I'm from
Spain, if that matters (just in case that the problem only affected
Europe or something like that).
    In fact, I thought I was unsubscribed due to a bounce, and tried
to resubscribe: Majordomo didn't answered until this morning, almost
24 hours after I requested it.
