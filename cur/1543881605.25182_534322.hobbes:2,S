I guess you will have to make sure that cancel_delayed_work() is always
followed by a flush of the workqueue, otherwise you might get this situation:
	CPU 0				CPU 1
	===============================	=======================
					<timer expires>
	cancel_delayed_work(x) == 0	-->delayed_work_timer_fn(x)
	kfree(x);			-->do_IRQ()
	y = kmalloc(); // reuses x
					<--do_IRQ()
					__queue_work(x)
	--- OOPS ---
That's my main concern.  If you are certain that can't happen, then fair
enough.
Note that although you can call cancel_delayed_work() from within a work item
handler, you can't then follow it up with a flush as it's very likely to
deadlock.

I suppose that's true.  As previously stated, my main objection to del_timer()
is the fact that it doesn't tell you if the timer expiry function is still
running.
Can you show me a patch illustrating exactly how you want to change
cancel_delayed_work()?  I can't remember whether you've done so already, but
if you have, I can't find it.  Is it basically this?:
 static inline int cancel_delayed_work(struct delayed_work *work)
 {
 	int ret;
-	ret = del_timer_sync(&work->timer);
+	ret = del_timer(&work->timer);
 	if (ret)
 		work_release(&work->work);
 	return ret;
 }
I was thinking this situation might be a problem:
	CPU 0				CPU 1
	===============================	=======================
					<timer expires>
	cancel_delayed_work(x) == 0	-->delayed_work_timer_fn(x)
	schedule_delayed_work(x,0)	-->do_IRQ()
	<keventd scheduled>
	x->work()
					<--do_IRQ()
					__queue_work(x)
But it won't, will it?

Good point.  I don't think that's a problem because cancel_delayed_work()
won't clear the pending flag if it didn't remove a timer.

Yeah, I guess so.
Okay, you've convinced me, I think - provided you consider the case I
outlinded at the top of this email.
If you give me a patch to alter cancel_delayed_work(), I'll substitute it for
mine and use that that instead.  Dave Miller will just have to live with that
patch being there:-)
