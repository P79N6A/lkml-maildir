The generic interrupt handlers in Linux _do_ know all that.  They
need to, to mask the interrupt :)
The driver would not need to know: a global per-cpu variable can keep
track of where the most recent interrupt came from.

Yes, but that doesn't explain the masking.  It explains why there are
generic interrupt handlers (which know about the 8259, various APIC
etc.) and the driver interrupt handlers.

No, there is no problem.  But there is a performance impact.  Masking
and unmasking the 8259 is an I/O operation which may be quite slow.
If we don't need it, why do we take the performance hit?

Thanks.  That was very informative.
