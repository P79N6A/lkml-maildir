That would be great! The fix looks good -- what you want to add in
addition is checking that this is a rw request. So before your switch,
do something ala
	/*
	 * we don't support special requests
	 */
	if (!(CURRENT->flags & REQ_CMD)) {
		blkdev_dequeue_request(CURRENT);
		end_that_request_first(CURRENT, 0, CURRENT->nr_sectors);
		end_that_request_last(CURRENT);
		continue;
	}
