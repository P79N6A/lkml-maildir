Hi,
I'm having some problems using SCSI-generic (sg loaded as module) to
access my scanner on linux 2.4 (using SANE).
I've been using 2.2.0 - 2.2.19pre17 without any problems, but when I
changed to 2.4 the problems started. 2.4.1 gave the following entries in
my kernel log file (id 7 = scsi card, id 6 = scanner, id 0 = hd):
Mar 10 20:06:15 palpatine kernel: scsi : aborting command due to timeout
: pid 0, scsi0, channel 0, id 6, 
lun 0 Read (6) 00 00 5e 8d 00 
Mar 10 20:06:17 palpatine kernel: SCSI host 0 abort (pid 0) timed out -
resetting
Mar 10 20:06:17 palpatine kernel: SCSI bus is being reset for host 0
channel 0.
Mar 10 20:06:28 palpatine kernel: (scsi0:0:0:0) Synchronous at 80.0
Mbyte/sec, offset 15
I saw that the Adaptec driver was changed in the latest prereleases so i
tried 2.4.3pre4 which gave me:
Mar 14 15:48:10 palpatine kernel: scsi0:0:6:0: Attempting to queue an
ABORT message
Mar 14 15:48:10 palpatine kernel: (scsi0:A:6:0): Queuing a recovery SCB
Mar 14 15:48:10 palpatine kernel: scsi0:0:6:0: Device is disconnected,
re-queuing SCB
Mar 14 15:48:10 palpatine kernel: Recovery code sleeping
Mar 14 15:48:10 palpatine kernel: Recovery SCB completes
Mar 14 15:48:10 palpatine kernel: Recovery code awake
Mar 14 15:48:10 palpatine kernel: aic7xxx_abort returns 8194
Mar 14 15:48:11 palpatine kernel: scsi0:0:6:0: Attempting to queue a
TARGET RESET message
Mar 14 15:48:11 palpatine kernel: scsi0:0:6:0: Command not found
Mar 14 15:48:11 palpatine kernel: aic7xxx_dev_reset returns 819
If you need more info just mail me and I'll provide it...
Thanks,
David
