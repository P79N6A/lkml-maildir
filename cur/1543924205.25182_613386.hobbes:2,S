Subject: [PATCH 0/4] Blackfin I2C/TWI driver updates and bug fixing according to Jean's review

Still remain in old I2C driver interface. I plan to move to new style I2C API recently.
Also intend to using new TWI register accessor functions as Jean's suggestions.
Then move that static pin_req setting to our Blackfin board files.
But currently version is OK and tested on Blackfin board with I2C devices.
