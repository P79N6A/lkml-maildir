Joerg, that is the problem. It was 10 years ago. USB was not existant,
Firewire wasn't there, FC, etc. You could rely on your naming then.
But it was last millenium, now dev= parameters are anything but
stable. It just does not cut anymore, while using device node to
specify device you want to work with is natural. And I am willing to
bet if you give this oprion to users of other Unix-like OSes they
would not complain either.
