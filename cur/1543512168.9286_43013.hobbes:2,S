I'm trying to find out if this is my NIC
or the ne2kpci driver.
It's a Magitronic I-E32-COMBOPNP-1
from lspci -vv
00:0a.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. 8029
        Subsystem: Unknown device 10ec:8029
        Control: I/O+ Mem+ BusMaster- SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop-
ParErr- Stepping- SERR- FastB2B-
        Status: Cap- 66Mhz- UDF- FastB2B- ParErr- DEVSEL=medium
>TAbort- <TAbort- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR-
        Interrupt: pin A routed to IRQ 10
        Region 0: I/O ports at e400
This currently a RedHat kernel  2.2.12-20
on a K7-550 and a MSI board.
but the speed was slow with all kernels since 2.2.5
and My K6-III 400 and FIC-2013 as well.
A FTP test showed this:
rlogin $SRC
ftp $DEST
DEST\SRC  |  SUN  |   HP   | LINUX  |
------------------------------------
SUN       |  --   | 655.02 | 32.97  |
HP        | 787.8 |  --    | 23.41  |
LINUX     | 750   | 800    |  --    |
------------------------------------
results in Kbytes/s as reported by the ftp client
SUN   = SunOS 5.6
HP    = HP-UX 10.20
LINUX = 2.2.10-ac5 
This is for the same 22746572 byte file
On an unloaded system.
Notice the big slowdown for outgoing data.
Why? I use NFS alot and this is a real problem.
(Solaris and HP-UX use supplied ftp server/client.
Linux uses wu-2.5.0(1) from wu-ftpd-2.5.0-9.i386.rpm)
