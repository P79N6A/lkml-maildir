Sure, tie yourself to a Linux-specific mechanism that may or may not work
over things like NFS. That's much worse.

Right, tie yourself to process-shared mutexes which historically weren't
available on Linux. That's much better than an option that's been stable for
a decade.

How is that better? There is literally no improvement, since the first check
will (almost) always fail.

The evidence is that more than half the time, this avoids the sleep. That
means it has zero cost, since the yield is no heavier than a sleep would be,
and has a possible benefit, since the first sleep may be too long.

The problem is that if the estimate is too short, pre-emption will result in
a huge performance drop. If the estimate is too long, there will be some
wasted CPU. What was the claimed benefit of doing this again?

Your standards for "optimal" are totally unrealistic. In his case, it was
optimal. Using platform-specific optimizations would have meant more
development and test time for minimal benefit. Sleeping first would have had
some performance cost and no benefit. In his case, sched_yield was optimal.
Really.
