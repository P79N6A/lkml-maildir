Right...

How do you feel about the flag that I've been proposing that a driver 
that needs to probe for its hardware could set and that says "if we 
return an error (or specifically -ENODEV I guess) the hardware's 
reallyreally not present and the device should not register"?
Greg, and how do you feel about such a flag?
As an alternative to the flag, how would either of you feel about either
1) adding a .discover method to struct device_driver that noone other 
than drivers for this old non generically discoverable hardware would 
set but which would make a registration fail if set and returning < 0?
2) adding that method only to platform_driver?
3) ... and after a few months when people aren't paying attention 
anymore rename .probe to .init and .discover back to .probe? ;-)

Yes, I know about the -ENODEV / -ENXIO thing. I asked for comment on 
that as well, but haven't gotten any.
Anyways, the additional method would, I feel, be the conceptually 
cleanest approach. Practically speaking though, simply doing a manual 
probe and only calling platform_register() after everything is found to 
be present and accounted for is not much of a problem either.
Takashi, how would you feel about a setup for ALSA going like:
static struct platform_device *devices[SNDRV_CARDS];
static int __devinit snd_foo_probe(int i)
{
	struct snd_card *card;
         if (port[i] == SNDRV_AUTO_PORT) {
                 snd_printk(KERN_ERR "specify port\n");
		return -EINVAL;
         }
	card = snd_card_new(index[i], id[i], THIS_MODULE, 0);
         if (!card) {
                 snd_printk(KERN_ERR "could not create card\n");
                 return -EWHATEVER;
         }
	/* all the other things the probe method does */
         if (snd_card_register(card) < 0) {
                 snd_printk(KERN_ERR "could not register card\n");
                 return -EWHATEVERSNDCARDREGISTERRETURNED;
         }
         devices[i] = platform_device_register_simple(NAME, i, NULL, 0);
         if (IS_ERR(devices[i])) {
                 snd_printk(KERN_ERR "could not register device\n");
		snd_card_free(card);
                 return PTR_ERR(devices[i]);
         }
         platform_set_drvdata(devices[i], card);
         return 0;
}
Then deleting the .probe method from the foo_platform_driver struct and 
in the module init simply do a manual probe, using:
         if (platform_driver_register(&snd_foo_driver) < 0) {
                 snd_printk(KERN_ERR "could not register driver\n");
                 return -EARGHH;
         }
         for (cards = 0, i = 0; i < SNDRV_CARDS; i++)
                 if (enable[i] && snd_foo_probe(i) >= 0)
                         cards++
         if (!cards) {
                 printk(KERN_ER "foo not found or device busy\n");
                 platform_driver_unregister(&snd_foo_driver);
                 return -ENODEV;
         }
Also attached as a patch against adlib.c (it's the simplest driver by 
far, so using that one as an example. it's present in 2.6.17-rc1).
The platform_device registration could also stay in the init loop, but 
since we want the free the card again if it fails same as with all the 
other failures it's best off at the end of probe() I feel. You 
introduced all these nonpnp_probe() methods for platform devices so we 
do have a nice place to put this...
Would you feel this would be an okay setup, assuming we're not getting 
that .discover method?
Rene.
