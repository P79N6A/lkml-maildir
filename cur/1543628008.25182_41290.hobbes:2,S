and in fact this is why IRQ handlers in the irqbalance patch stay affine
to a single CPU for at least 10 msecs. So for most practical purposes when
there is no direct affinity between tasks and IRQs, this brings us very
close the highest possible affinity that can be achieved.
/proc/irq/*/smp_affinity is still preserved for those workloads when some
direct relationship can be established between process activity and IRQ
load. (such as perfectly partitioned server workloads.)

yes, this is why the irqbalance patch goes to great lengths to assure that
distribution of IRQs is as random as possible, with the following
variation: idle CPUs are more likely to be used by the IRQ balancing
mechanism than busy CPUs.
