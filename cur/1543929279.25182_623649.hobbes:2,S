If the device/server/... takes more than 2 minutes to recover, how does this
imply the error path "does not work well" ? Or is your goal to handle all 
possible errors in less than two minutes? [That might be a worthy goal,
but is probably far from easy and likely impossible in some cases]

From the user perspective a kernel randomly throwing backtraces is 
a broken kernel.

iirc TASK_KILLABLE fixed NFS only. While that's a good thing there are
unfortunately a lot more subsystems that would need the same treatment.

Yes let's break things first instead of looking at the implications closely.
