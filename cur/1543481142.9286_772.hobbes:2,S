Doesn't matter: it's the only usable indication of recent behaviour that
we have, and in any case, the goodness is tuned so that CPU bound
process always have goodness lower than interactive processes of the
same priority, regardless of the current counter.
Using the last known goodness on that CPU is still good enough.
