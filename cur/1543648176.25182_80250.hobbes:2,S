aio_nbytes is clamped to disallow negative values at present.

Okay, if it is documented, that makes sense.  I just wasn't sure if it 
happened to be an oversight.

That's a possibility.  I don't like the idea of splitting things out too 
much, as special cases look ugly.  The io_submit interface really does 
assume that the file descriptor exists, and removing that doesn't really 
make sense -- non-file descriptor consuming operations should most likely 
be their own syscalls (imho).  But if you're okay with requiring an fd 
for the NOOP, then that seems alright.  Does anyone else have any thoughts 
on the matter?
