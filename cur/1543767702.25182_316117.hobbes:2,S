Libor,
When you say "older", what exactly do you mean?  I have different test that normally fails 
with just get_user_pages(), but it works with 2.6.9 and above.  I haven't been able to get 
any kernel earlier than 2.6.9 to compile or boot properly, so I'm having a hard time 
narrowing down the actual point when get_user_pages() started working.
