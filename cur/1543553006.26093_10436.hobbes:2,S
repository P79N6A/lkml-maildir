I don't see your point.
I'm saying that EVERYTHING should be order-critical.
It is NEVER acceptable to change the order of object files.
If the Makefile said that the ordering should be
	obj-y = usb.o usbcore.o third.o last.o
then the fact that usbcore.o is a multi-part object file SHOULD NOT
MATTER.
We should just link it in the order specified:
	ld -r usbdrv.o $(obj-y)
No re-ordering. No expansion of multi-objs. No games. Do what the Makefile
author expected.
In short, we should _remove_ all traces of stuff like
	O_OBJS = $(filter-out $(export-objs), $(obj-y))
It's wrong.
We should just have
	O_OBJS = $(obj-y)
which is always right.
Then we change the meaning of OX_OBJS, and instead of saying
	ALL_O = $(OX_OBJS) $(O_OBJS)
we just say
	ALL_O = $(O_OBJS)
and the meaning of $OX_OBJS is the _subset_ of object file that have
SYMTAB objects.
This should all work pretty much as-is, with som every simple
modifications to existing old-style Makefiles, and with some even simpler
modifications to the new-style ones. In fact, it should remove pretty much
all the ugly games that new-style files do.
And it should make all this FIRST/LAST object file mockery a total
non-issue, because the whole concept turns out to be completely
unnecessary.
Is there anything that makes this more complex than what I've outlined
above?
