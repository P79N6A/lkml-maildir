OK... found finally time to re-test, I ran today the 10/30 smsc-ircc2 driver
 under RedHat 8.0, kernel 2.5.45 and the 115200 limit (after patching the
 few remaining uses of __FUNCTION__ in smsc-ircc.c), and the GPRS
 link stays up instead of going down after < 3 minutes. Speed is definitely
 slower (using the GPRS link) than the current 2.4.20-rc1 / smc-ircc combo
 but given the record of GPRS performance 'round here I do know it's not
 meaningful yet - I'll repost with irdadump logs if performance stays on the
 low end (my "fast" transfers peak at 3.9KB/s, the slowness of today's
 tests was about 0.2KB/s).
Under 2.5 I keep being spammed by
