I wasn't aware that I was supposed to post this as a regression, so 
changed the subject, hoping that someone will pick this up and run with 
it. Primary issue being that link is not seen on this chipset under 
2.6.20-rc5 via in-tree e1000 driver, despite multiple cycles of ifconfig 
$eth up && ethtool $eth | grep link && ifconfig $eth down. Tested on 2 
machines with identical hardware.
