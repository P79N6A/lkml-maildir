OK, it looks like:
David Woodhouse added this functionality 5 May 2005:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=075d6eb16d273dab7b7b4b83fcee8bce4ee387ed
and then Jon Loeliger removed everything in this section 17 Sep 2005
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=6c45ab992e4299c869fb26427944a8f8ea177024
David/Jon:
Is this section still used on PPC, or can the entire support for extratext be removed?
Thanks
