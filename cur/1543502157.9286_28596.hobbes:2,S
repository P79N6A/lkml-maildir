Hi!
I'm running 2.2.10-ac8 (2.2.10 wasn't bootable here) (compiled with gcc
2.8.1), distribution is Stampede 0.89... I'm also using a aha-2940 card
with one cd-rom toaster and a harddrive. If I start cdda2wav and press
ctrl-c I'll get a kernel panic.
This is 100% reproducable. I haven't been able to fetch the output from
the kernel panic since I haven't set things up correct yet =)
Anyway, if anyone wants the output I could fetch it. 
The problem doesn't exist when running cdparanoia, so it's not really an
important issue for me. =)
Ideas? questions? etc? mail me =)
