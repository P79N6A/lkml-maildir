The german support of Fujitsu sent me a diagnostic tool and this
states that my drive has an hardware-failure or at least does not
behave like it should.
They said that I can send the drive to their support and they will
fix it with no extra charge because it still has warranty.
After all we can see that Linux can even handle "evil" drives...
