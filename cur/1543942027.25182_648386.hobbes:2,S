yup.

I used kgdb continuously for 4-5 years until it broke.  I don't think I
ever used it much for "debugging" as such.  I used it more for general
observation of what's going on in the kernel.  And for _confirmation_ of
what's going on (ie: testing that the actual state matches the expected
state).
I'd end up doing my development with the assumption that kgdb was present. 
One example: rather than putting printks all over the place to ensure that
the right thing was happening at the right time I'd instead add code like
void foo(void)
{
}
	...
	if (expr)
		foo();
then, when the testcase was up and running and in steady state, break in
and put a breakpoint on foo().  Continue, wait for the breakpoint then go
in and observe locals, globals, data structures, etc.
It's hard to describe (and remember!).  But the presence of the debugger as
a development (not debugging) tool changes the way you do development a bit.
