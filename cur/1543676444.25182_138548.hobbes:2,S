I'm not totally sure about the status of the SATA on the Intel right
now. I was under the impression it was very similar to the PATA.
For some of the others its a bit variable:
	HPT some people report work some dont
	Promise 20376 - Promise have a GPL driver but there are integration
things to resolve (mostly our end not theirs)
	SI 3112 - Now works well with almost all drives. 
	3Ware SATA raid - works
