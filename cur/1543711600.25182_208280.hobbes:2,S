I think it DOES confuse people. If they see that, they think the kernel
has (got) a graphics subsystem (now). That is simply not true, since it
is not even the lowest layer of the graphics subsystem in Linux, except
on a few special cases. It is just an basic accelerated 2D framebuffer. 
No more, no less.
When we have all devices in that class, that are needed to run fully
accelerated 3D graphics, without any direct hardware access, then we
could call it "graphics class" without any confusion.
So PLEASE consider this confusion or people will start argueing with me
whether Linux has an in kernel graphics subsystem (like KGI once) and
not all people can be convinced by code, because not all are coders
anymore ;-)
Thanks & regards
