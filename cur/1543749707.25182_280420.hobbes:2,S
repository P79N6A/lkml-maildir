At severe risk of starting a flame war all over again, here goes.
In other words, that $50 million offer was also just so much
vaporware.  Thats not a question, its a statement, because you
personally sure as h--- don't have $50 million to back it up and I
have serious doubts the council would have backed you.  $50 million is
a decent sum of money, even if they do have their own casino that may
be quite profitable.
Really now, are *you* doing the Cherokee Nation any good at all? 
Or are you just another promoter trying to take advantage of a
re-organization as they bring their government into the 21st century
and learn to cope with the effects of having their own casino and
(in your opinion) money to burn from it.  Maybe they see the
advantages of getting technical, in fact I'm sure they do, and can
probably do that far better for them without your kind of help.
I have visited the web site, as I'm sure some of the other
commentators here have also done, and viewed what I saw while keeping
in mind some of the many fine Cherokee people I've had the
pleasure of knowing in my 70 years.  Make no mistake, some of them
have been my mental superiors, and they will catch you up at some
point, if not this one.  Wilma would have run you off long ago, if she
were still President.
That said, I personally applaud them for the future direction they
seem to have chosen, but will not pass judgement on this new license
until the legal beagles have had a chance to disect the proposed
license when its finally published, and the chances of its being held
as valid in the courts of the rest of the world.  Believe me, I've
seen fine Cherokees screwed in the courts of this (great?) nation
several times, just because they were of Original American 
bloodlines.   Now I'd like them to be treated as equals for a change.
The feds say they are sovereign, but lets see if the acts match the
words.
The only other such setup within our borders is the Navajo Nation,
much larger in totall real estate, but they have not managed nearly
so well. Their main claim to fame is all the coal burning power plants
in the 4 corners area that feed LA with lots of electricity, but
renders large parts of the San Juan River basin uninhabitable with
its pollution because it is not federally emissions regulated. The
air gets pretty damned thick when mother nature puts a lid on it
preventing the dissipation of what was then, in 1979, of some 23
Gigawatts worth of coal burnt per hour, with another 40 some under
construction then.  NDI whats happened since.
Until then Jeff, the GPL is a damned fine license.  And I would like
to see it kept.
