Stephen's point of view is correct.  RAID0 fails
in the same manner with the large pagecache BIOs
which I'm feeding it.  It fails in the same manner
with O_DIRECT on ext2.
Neil knows about it, and will get to it.  mkp has
a 2.4 request splitter which he will turn into a
2.5 BIO splitter.
As you said - it's being worked on.
