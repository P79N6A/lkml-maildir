I fixed the take-3 patch according to your and Paul's suggestions.
The attached take-4 patches replace the avc_lock in security/selinux/avc.c
by the lock-less read access with RCU.
The patches consist of three parts as follows:
[1] selinux.rcu-2.6.8.1-take4.patch
     removed the spinlock (avc_lock) from security/selinux/avc.c,
     and applied RCU-approach for the lock-less read access to the AVC.
[2] list_replace_rcu-2.6.8.1.patch
     added list_replace_rcu() to include/linux/list.h for the atomic updating
     operations according to RCU-model.
[3] atomic_inc_return-2.6.8.1.patch
     added atomic_inc_return() and atomic_dec_return() to i386, x86_64 and ARM
     architectures. It's necessary for the [1] patch.
[Changes by these patches from original implementation]
- Some of the data structures are re-defined.
  (struct avc_entry/struct avc_node/struct avc_cache)
- The direct references from security-private member in inode, task_struct and so on
  were removed, since these references prevent from applying RCU.
  Currently, avc_entry_ref is not used.
- The pre-allocation semantics of avc_node structure was replaced by kmalloc()
  on demand, since it's necessary for applying RCU.
  (The number of nodes is adjusted by AVC_CACHE_THRESHOLD, but it's not a hard limit.)
- avc_update_node() can return -ENOMEM when kmalloc() returns NULL.
  But this is not a significant problem, since the function is actually called
  by only avc_has_perm_noaudit() for the control of the flood of audit-logs.
