Maybe we shouldn't be using these helper macros in exported-to-userspace
headers.  Do you know which headers are affected?  Did you consider jsut
expanding the macros in situ for thse cases?

Seems relatively harmless.
But I'd have thought that if we're going to do this, we should create a
standard naming convention for types which the kernel exports to userspace.
Say, kern_*.
In which case the change becomes:
#define kern_aligned_u64 unsigned long long __attribute__((aligned(8)))
#define kern_aligned_be64 __be64 __attribute__((aligned(8)))
#define kern_aligned_le64 __le64 __attribute__((aligned(8)))
(exported to userspace)
and, inside __KERNEL__:
#define aligned_u64 kern_aligned_u64
etc.  And, of course, all those bit of kernel headers which are presently
using aligned_u64 in exposed-to-userspace places should be switched to
kern_aligned_u4.
What thinkest thou?
If _that_ is all sane then we should do it all in a singe header file, say
kern_types_for_userspace.h.  include/linux/types.h would then do:
#include <linux/kern_types_for_userspace.h>
#ifdef __KERNEL__
#define aligned_u64 kern_aligned_u64
etc...
(all approximate, you-get-what-I-mean)
Duno if it'd be worth the effort, but it is The Right Thing To Do.
