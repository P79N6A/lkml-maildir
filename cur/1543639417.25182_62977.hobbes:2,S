i have been tuning the performance of eepro100 these days. we tested linux router with smartbits. our router has two PIII800 CPU,512M ram. 
kernel version is 2.4.19-pre1. the driver is e100.
in the test,we found that the throughput of 64bytes frames is 61%. that's about 90kpps. then we tuned almost all the parameters the e100 driver applied, but could not get higher results.
so i think the limit is at the eepro100 card. is there any way to improve the throughput? or someone got a higher throughput then that?
the eepro100 chip is 82559.
please cc. thanks.
