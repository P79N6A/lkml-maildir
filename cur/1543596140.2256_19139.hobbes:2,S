That's a direct consequence of the policy quoted in paragraph (3) and
NOT an error in the logic. It's why I'm against the current policy.

You're not thinking clearly. Try the following simple fix to that:
 Q> dep_arch_tristate '  AM79C961A support' CONFIG_ARM_AM79C961A \
 Q>	"$CONFIG_ARCH_ACORN" $CONFIG_NET_ETHERNET
That adds only two extra characters, neither conspicuous, and PASSES
my code.
Best wishes from Riley.
