Hi Alexey,
On embedded systems, the tradeoff is not the same. The immediate values
trade a little bit of system memory (to keep the pointers to the
variable and instruction as well as the size of the variable, only used
when the variable is updated) in order to remove cache line hot paths.
Also, embedded systems with physically read-only memory clearly does not
want to enable this.
Mathieu
