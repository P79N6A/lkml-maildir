Sorry, screwed up with my patchbomb script...

| No, please, if you are going to convert anything like this, use the
| dev_dbg(), dev_warn(), and assorted macros instead.  Or if nothing else,
| the usb subsystem has it's own dbg(), err() and warn() macros that
| should be gotten rid of, but that's a lot of changes...
|
Okay.  A bit more work, but it makes sense.
| These comments pretty much go for all of your patches in this series,
| please rework them all.
|
Any other tips on how the usb printk()s should be formatted to maintain
consistency?  Or some driver that I could use as an example?
| thanks,
