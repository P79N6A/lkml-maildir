I just switched from 2.2.19pre7 to 2.4.10-ac11.
I had this line before appended to lilo
append="ether=11,0x300,eth1"
Which worked ok, on 2.4.10 this isn't picked up. So I added
append="ether=15,0xb000,eth0 ether=11,0x300,eth1"
Now it works again, not exactly a bug but I guess it's worth mentioning.
