hi!
consider the following:
p1 flocks file /nfs/a , opens it for update, reads record # 100, modifies
it and writes it to disk.
p2 does the same as p1, but is started after the read of p1.
i did read in "distributed systems" that it *** can *** take up to 3
seconds for the client to receive update information (nfs cache latency).
i guess the upper system will work anyway (consider the update as "add 10
to value") without losing counts?
kind regards,
