It's silly to treat financial risk as being a one dimensional quantity.
It could easily be that Red Hat decided that the mp3 patent owners would
be going after people with deep pockets.  If this is the risk model,
Red Hat's risk would be much much higher than Debian's.

Sure, if you have several plausible interpretations, you pick the one
you feel is likely to be the most important, and if all of them seem
likely you pick the one that seems worst.
But, ultimately, you can't treat software patents consistently.
There's no reasonable way to do so.

Anything to do with software patents is silly.  Being liberal about
software patents is silly.  Being conservative about software patents
is silly.
Copyright, while far from perfect, can at least be reasoned about.

What makes you think I'm sure about what's being patented in 22 of
those patents?
I should probably have said "As for patent claims applying to mp3,
...", but the issue is thorny enough that even that might not have been
accurate enough.
But, treating "this particular patent" as a meta-syntactic variable
should be adequate for you to understand what I was saying.
Bottom line, though: softare patents generally make very little sense.
