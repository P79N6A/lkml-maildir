He has booted with bootmem debugging output.  Given that the bdebug()
describing the request wasn't hit yet, it must be one of the BUG_ON()s
(or bdata is NULL).
If you can find out the line with gdb, this would be great.
Besides that it might be useful to move the bdebug() before the
BUG_ON()s.  With the line info available, the expressions that trigger
a bug are pretty unambiguous, but since we would print the parameters
anyway we can as well do so before a possible panic to quickly deduce
what went wrong without decoding.

Subject: bootmem: print request details before BUG_ON(them)
Moving the request details print-out before the sanity checks that
might panic() enables us to analyse invalid requests without having
access to the line information of the stack dump.
