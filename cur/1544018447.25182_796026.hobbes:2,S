It's functionally speaking the same thing... the advantage with starting 
out with the call and then patch in the native code as opposed to the 
other way around is to be able to handle things properly before we're 
ready to run the patching code.
Right now a number of the call sites contain a huge push/pop sequence 
followed by an indirect call.  We can patch in the native code to avoid 
the branch overhead, but the register constraints and icache footprint 
is unchanged.
