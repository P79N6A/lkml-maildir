AFAIK, Linus has permitted to make available binary-only modules, provided
that they use available kernel interfaces. With kind of painware as
losemodems, it is probably possible to deal with the hardware in some
module or driver supplied in object form. For the rest, users like me that
are not going to use binary only stuff, will just ignore such random set
of bits.
And if available kernel interfaces are not enough, a patch in source form 
that provides the needed interfaces will do the trick.
