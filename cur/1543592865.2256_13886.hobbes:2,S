I wouldn't go so far as to say totally broken (mostly because I've tried
like _hell_ to find a better way, and [despite minor successes] I've not
been able to come up with something which covers all cases that even _I_
[hw tech] can think of well).  Hard numbers are just plain bad, see below.
I _will_ say that it is entirely too easy to break for comfort ;-)

No, I don't think that's the case at all.  The individual zone balancing
logic (or individual page [content] type logic) hasn't been inplimented
yet (content type handling I don't think we want), but doesn't look like
it'll be any trouble to do with the structures in place.  That's just a
fleshing out thing.  The variations in aging rate is the most difficult
problem I can see.  IMHO, it needs to be either decoupled and done by an
impartial bystander (tried that, ran into info flow troubles because of
scheduling) or integrated tightly into the allocator proper (tried that..
interesting results but has problems of it's own wrt the massive changes
in general strategy needed to make it work.. approaches rewrite)

IMHO, the only thing of interest you can do with clocks is set your state
sample rate.  If state is changing rapidly, you must sample rapidly.  As
far as corrections go, you can only insert a corrective vector into the
mix and then see if the sum induced the desired change in direction.  The
correct magnitude of this vector is not even possible to know.. that's
what makes it so darn hard [defining numerical goals is utterly bogus].

With much interest :)
