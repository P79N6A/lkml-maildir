Can anyone provide a hint for an easy way I can cause a process to
enter into and exit from an iowait (uninterruptible sleep) state
at will, without tinkering with the hardware, and without doing
something that will adversely affect other running processes?
This is not a kernel development question, but I'm betting some
kernel hacker knows how I can exploit a syscall to do this somehow.
Thanks,
