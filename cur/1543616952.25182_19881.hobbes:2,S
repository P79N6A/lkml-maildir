Subject: PROBLEM: kernel 2.4.17 unable to mount root fs when initial  ram disk size set to 0 with LILO

Hi,
I have detected a problem. When kernel 2.4.17 is configured with a 4096K 
initial ram disk, but the ramsize = 0 parameter is specified in lilo.conf, 
the system is unable to boot due to the following set of events:
    a) In routine rd_load_image, line 660 of file linux/drivers/block/rd.c, 
nblocks is 0 at
       line 710. Next, the call to crd_load returns 0 and control transfers 
to label
       successful_load, where ROOT_DEV is changed to 01:00 from the initial 
value (03:03 on
       my system).
    b) In routine mount_root in file linux/fs/super.c, control proceeds to 
the "for (p =
       fs_names" loop at line 1039. Of course, none of the configured file 
types has a
       root fs at 01:00, and the loop falls through to the panic statement 
at line 1049 with
       the message "VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 01:00".
    c) If lilo.conf contains the statement "ramdisk = 100" rather than 
"ramdisk = 0", the system
       boots normally.
Kernel version 2.4.16, with the same configuration, boots normally with 
"ramdisk = 0".
Thank you,
Larry
