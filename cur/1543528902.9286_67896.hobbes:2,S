Please read my response to Ulrich.  The patch results in correct
behaviour and is binary compatible in all combinations, even with libc4
and libc5, without a new syscall.
A one line change to Glibc is sufficient.  New Glibcs work correctly
with older kernels, and old Glibcs work correctly with newer kernels.
Applications always see either DT_UNKNOWN or, with up to date Glibc and
kernel, the correct type.
There are other reasons why another syscall may be desirable, but the
reason you give is not one of them.
