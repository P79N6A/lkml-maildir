Note I said "developer", not "kernel developer".  If the audience for a
feature is kernel developers, userspace developers and perhaps the most
sophisticated sysadmins then that's a small audience.  It's certainly an
_important_ audience, but the feature is not as important as those
codepaths which Uncle Tillie needs to run his applications.

To me, an "end user" is one who is capable of identifying the power switch
and the ANY key, not an application programmer!

Fair enough.

Nope, kprobes allows a kernel module to patch hooks into the running
binary.  That's all it does, really.   See
