I did mix them up, my apologies til Magallon. As always you should just
use -dev=/dev/hdX and it will work the best, there's no need to give ATA
or ATAPI. They are too easy to mix up as the names don't really give you
any hints on what access method they will utilize. Using -dev also means
there's no reason to run -scanbus at all, since you know where the
device is. If you don't, then you probably should be using k3b or some
other helper to work out things for you.
