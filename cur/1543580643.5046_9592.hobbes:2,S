A kiobuf is 124 bytes, a buffer_head 96.  And a buffer_head is additionally
used for caching data, a kiobuf not.

You could still embed it into a surrounding structure, even if there are cases
where an additional memory allocation is needed, yes.

array_len, io_count, the presence of wait_queue AND end_io, and the lack of
scatter gather in one kiobuf struct (you always need an array), and AFAICS
that is what the networking guys dislike.
They often just want multiple buffers in one physical page, and and array of
those.
Now one could say: just let the networkers use their own kind of buffers
(and that's exactly what is done in the zerocopy patches), but that again leds
to inefficient buffer passing and ungeneric IO handling.
S.th. like:
struct kiovec {
	struct page *           kv_page;        /* physical page        */
	u_short                 kv_offset;      /* offset into page     */
	u_short                 kv_length;      /* data length          */
};
			 
enum kio_flags {
	KIO_LOANED,     /* the calling subsystem wants this buf back    */
	KIO_GIFTED,     /* thanks for the buffer, man!                  */
	KIO_COW         /* copy on write (XXX: not yet)                 */
};
struct kio {
	struct kiovec *         kio_data;       /* our kiovecs          */
	int                     kio_ndata;      /* # of kiovecs         */
	int                     kio_flags;      /* loaned or giftet?    */
	void *                  kio_priv;       /* caller private data  */
	wait_queue_head_t       kio_wait;	/* wait queue           */
};
makes it a lot simpler for the subsytems to integrate.

Of course it doesn't work. We've performed a software upgrade.
