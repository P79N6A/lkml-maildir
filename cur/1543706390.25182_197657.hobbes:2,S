Why is that a bad thing? Why should I want to see dev entries for firewire
drives on my 486 or LPT1 on my legacy-free laptop?

It does as well as udev does. You say it yourself, "if the kernel switches to
dynamic major/minor". The same is true of devfs. It was designed for dynamic
major/minors, and the static ones were for backward compatibility with static
/devs.

How is that a problem?

Not true at all. If you don't like the naming scheme, run devfsd. Just
like running udev, only unlike udev at least you have device files even
if the daemon's not running.

No, but the userspace daemon attached to it could do so, just like udev.
