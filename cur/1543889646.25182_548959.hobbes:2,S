No.  The page-exciser ends (cancels) PG_writeback, not waits for it (something
has to clear the flag).  The problem is that the truncation routines may be
sat there holding a lock on the page whilst waiting for PG_writeback to go
away - so we have to clear PG_writeback before we can think about getting
PG_lock:-(

Possibly, though I'd rather they didn't see such a page.
