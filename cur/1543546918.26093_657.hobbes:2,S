What I meant is that any module could need to implement a functionality of
the kind of schedule_timeout() for whatever reason. In an usage like
process_timeout() the use of wake_up_process() is the obviously right one,
thus I thought that it made sense to export wake_up_process() to a module
too. It must not be misused of course, but I don't exclude there could be
a legitimate case where it's more appropriate than using a waitqueue.
