Thanks to your tests I am really sure that its no network-code problem anymore. But what I THINK it 
is: The network is allocating buffers dynamically and if the vm doesnt provide that buffers fast 
enough, it locks as well. Addendum: If I throttle to 100 MBit it doesnt slow-down even with 5000 
sockets. What do you think? I think its about having to free cache more quicker than possible. But 
then, why is CPU still at 30%? Might there be some limit per cyclus? For example if that "cleaner" 
wakes up every 10 ms and cleans max XXXXX pages, it would explain an artificial limit.
