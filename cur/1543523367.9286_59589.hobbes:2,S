If the output comes from an array lookup, 16 bits in and 8 out, then there's
a fairly obvious way they could optimise it. Kaisa Nyberg's Crypto 91 paper
"Perfect Nonlinear S-Boxes" has details.

If there's at least 8 bits of entropy in the input 16 bits to one of Nyberg's
perfect s-boxes, the output is provably unbiased in a fairly strong sense.
On the other hand, random s-boxes with 8-bit inputs are used in ciphers like
Blowfish and Twofish. Small random s-boxes are problematic, but they get
better as the inout size grows. Intel's 16-bit-input box should be fine,
even if its random.
Also, building a 16 by 8 Nyberg s-box would be horrendously expensive
using any method that occurs to me.
