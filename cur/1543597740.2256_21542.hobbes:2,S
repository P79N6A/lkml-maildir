Hello!
First I'm sorry if my question is offtopic, or it is not 
for this list, but I need a fast help. (I'm really out of 
time)
I want to write a module, which communicates through 
the /proc fs, but I don't know which kernel function to use 
in 2.4.x kernel instead of proc_register(), that was used 
with 2.0.x and 2.2.x kernel.
I searched for the answer for days on net, and in headers, 
but I didn't find anything (it is certainly because I'm new 
in Linux Community).
I would also be happy, if you redirect me to where I could 
find answers for such questions...
(sorry because of my English..)
Thank you
Akos
