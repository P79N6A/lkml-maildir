I'm not sure what you mean by $(objdir); I just got something to work
which creates the /dev/null symlink in a (newly created if necessary)
directory named
$(firstword $(obj-dirs) $(M))/.tmp
which seems to be a good place for both normal kernel builds and
external modules. External module builds seem not to set $(obj-dirs)...
Objections?
Kind regards,
 Horst
