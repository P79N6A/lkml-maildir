Or written a perl script to reprocess them into something saner for that
matter. The licensing does look problematic - perhaps Atmel will be
happy to dual license them (see the many BSD bits of code that are in
kernel and say
things like "or at your option you may use the GNU Public License
version 2 or
later" and similar.
