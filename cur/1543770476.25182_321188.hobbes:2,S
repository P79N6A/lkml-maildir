Hi,  I'm not sure if there's a posix way of doing this, but wanted to 
check if there is a way in linux.
I want to have a daemon that fork/execs a new process, but don't want 
(for various reasons) the responsibility for cleaning up those process 
with the wait() function family.   I'm assuming that if the init process 
became the parent of one of these forked processes, then it would clean 
them up for me (is this assumption true?).    Besides the daemon process 
exiting, is there a way to disown the process on purpose so that init 
inherits it?
Thanks,
   Davy
