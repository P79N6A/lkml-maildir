A little old lady was going up and down the halls in a nursing home.
As she walked, she would flip up the hem of her nightgown and say
"Supersex! Supersex!"
She walked up to an elderly man in a wheelchair.  Flipping her gown at
him, she again said, "Supersex."
He sat silently for a moment or two looking up at her.  He finally
answered, "I'll take the soup."
