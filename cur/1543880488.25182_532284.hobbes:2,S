The major difference is that the implementation in scx200_i2c is
hardware-specific, while the i2c-gpio driver is a generic one, so it's
a lot better.
What this means is that i2c-gpio obsoletes scx200_i2c, so I am inclined
to delete scx200_i2c right away. I'm not even sure anyone still uses it
now that scx200_acb has been fixed and is reported to work very well.
If anyone really needs to do I2C over GPIO pins on SCx200, this should
be reimplemented on top of i2c-gpio.
It also looks to me like i2c-ixp2000 and i2c-ixp4xx are obsoleted by
i2c-gpio. Deepak, can you please try using i2c-gpio instead and confirm
that i2c-ixp2000 and i2c-ixp4xx can be deleted?
Thanks,
