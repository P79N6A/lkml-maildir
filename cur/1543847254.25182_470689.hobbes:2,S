I remembered the use I had for it - for interrupt controllers that
want to save away an old cpu priority value or similar.  The ones that
need to do that (xics and cell) either don't do it (xics :) or use a
per-cpu array (cell).  Also, we call get_irq from an interrupt handler
for cascaded interrupts in some cases.  So I have applied your patch
and fixed the rejects.
Thanks,
Paul.
