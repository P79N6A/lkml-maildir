Hello
Sorry I had to send this to the whole developer list - there wasn't much in
the output of ksymoops that told me who to send it to. Here's the background
in case this is useful:
I have a background process that plays mp3's through amp. After one finished
and another tried to start, I got the oops and the mp3 never played (it went
on to the next one). The mp3 was on a UDF CD-RW, and the next one it played
was on the hard drive. Soon thereafter I noticed that all mp3's had stopped
and that any process that tried to read anything from /cdrom (including ls
/cdrom) went into daemon state and refused to die, even with kill -9. I'm
guessing that this means the problem is in either the CD-ROM code or the UDF
code, but it might be unrelated.
I've attached the output from ksymoops.
B4N
Bruce

ksymoops 2.3.4 on i686 2.4.0-test8.  Options used
     -V (default)
     -k /proc/ksyms (default)
     -l /proc/modules (default)
     -o /lib/modules/2.4.0-test8/ (default)
     -m /usr/src/linux/System.map (default)
Warning: You did not tell me where to find symbol information.  I will
assume that the log matches the kernel and modules that are running
right now and I'll use the default options above for symbol resolution.
If the current kernel and/or modules do not match the log, you can get
more accurate output by telling me the kernel version and where to find
map, modules, ksyms etc.  ksymoops -h explains the options.
