Maybe not.  If we do this, we lose the pretty CPUn columns in
/proc/interrupts.  That /proc/interrupts display requires that we maintain
NR_CPUS*NR_IRQS counters.
Given that a large NR_IRQs space will be sparsely populated, we should
dynamically allocate the NR_CPUS storage for each active IRQ, as you say.
That involves putting it into the irq_desc (as good a place as any).  And a
rather large number of trivial edits.  I guess we do this only for genirq?
