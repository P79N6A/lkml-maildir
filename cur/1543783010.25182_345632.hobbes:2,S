Its 2^wordsize - areas used for other purposes. 1-3GB on i386. A couple of

You can likely map a 512 M section starting at 6GB into your 
address space.

That depends on the architecture. Certainly no problem on Itanium.

Yes. I am not sure why one would have to use LFS. This should work on any 
filesystem.

Kernel gets a fault if the page pointed to is not present and reads it in 
from the file. And yes its faster because I/O is aligned and the page does 
not need to be copied from kernel to user space.
