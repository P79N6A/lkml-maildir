You are right that the code itself is not broken -- I did not read it 
properly at first. The stack frame gets small if I compile for s390x
with -fno-schedule-insn, so I suppose that optimization does
not work to well on this particular code. I'll try a different compiler
tomorrow.
I can verify the 32 bytes on i386 with both gcc-3.2 and gcc-3.3-snapshot.
However, when compiling i386 twofish with gcc-2.95, I get an 804 bytes
stack frame. Other architectures are probably somewhere in between
i386 and s390x here, so there should be done something about this.
