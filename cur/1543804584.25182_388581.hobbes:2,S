Ok this is on x86.  I think I see how it breaks, but I thought
Harald's patch would have the same problem.
I just ran a test program, and indeed __alignof__() gives 8
for "long long" and 4 for a struct containing a "long long"
on x86.  Yikes...
Linus is likely about to be on his way to the airport so I'll
push the fix in New Zealand.
