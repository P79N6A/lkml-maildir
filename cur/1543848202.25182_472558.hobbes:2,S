Thank you for the hint. However, poking /etc/init.d/nfsserver to use
the -p option is probably just as bad as adding "mountd 49500/tcp" to
/etc/services I am currently doing -- both get reverted on a distro
upgrade. Switching to CIFS will probably solve it all - one port
instead of three/four (and a fixed one), much more firewall- and
initscript-friendly.
