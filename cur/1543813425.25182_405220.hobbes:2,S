The patch works okay on my machine (ICH7R) although the patch didn't
apply to #upstream.  I'm not very sure about this change though.
1. Why apply it only to ATAPI devices?  ATA devices can benefit to.
   If it's because this bit shouldn't be turned on for NCQ, we can
   turn it on conditionally.  We'll probably need similar condition
   for ATAPI devices too if we support FIS-based PM switching.
2. I'm a bit skeptical whether this change will bring any noticeable
   performance improvement.  OTOH, this seems to be a good source for
   obscure problems on some controllers which might not implement/test
   this feature properly.  As more controllers implement AHCI spec,
   the possibility grows.
Anyways, here's the patch regenerated against #upstream.
