Forgot to mention, I've seen message:
	fbcon_setup: No support for fontwidth 8
in /var/log/dmesg. 
I found this printk() in fbcon_setup(), but i can't even imagine 
why it happens.
Sorry for not providing full info, but when i wrote first letter 
my head was full of gory thoughts about visws legacy irq handling :(
I can post complete log tomorrow.

I understand this situation perfectly, looks like it's almost common for
