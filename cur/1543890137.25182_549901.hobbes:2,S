Hmm, the comment above grow_dev_buffers indicates this should
not happen. But contrary to the comment, it doesn't go BUG
unless you're attaching dirty buffers to a page with dirty
buffers.
I suspect this happens more frequently with rd.c, because unlike
block_dev.c, it does not create dirty buffers in prepare_write.
However it could still happen in block_dev.c via mmaped memory,
as I said earlier.
I'm not saying this patch 1/3 is wrong, but we would at least
need to revise some comments. The grow_dev_buffers comment looks
like one of Andrew's. Maybe he can shed some more light on this?
