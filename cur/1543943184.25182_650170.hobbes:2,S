Heh. I just took it directly then.
I think it's more of a VM patch than a SCSI patch anyway, so I don't think 
you really should even have tried to push it through the SCSI tree.
It's not like we ever do the low-level FS changes for VFS issues through 
the FS maintainers anyway (ie you sent me all those iget/read_inode things 
directly rather than trying to go through each filesystem). I don't think 
this is any different, really.
