That's not the situation --- the problem is what to do if you have two
foreground tasks running on two cpus, and one sleeps.  You don't have
the option of scheduling the background task on the other CPU at this
point --- at least, not without forcing a CPU switch on the other
foreground task, which rather defeats the purpose of the exercise.  So
you either have to run it on the local CPU, which may not have been the
last one to run the background task, or you have to just leave the local
CPU idle in the hope that the background task will soon be able to get a
shot at its "home" CPU.
That's why if you have a background task and two interactive tasks on a
2-CPU machine, you really cannot avoid the background task jumping
between CPUs unless you are willing to leave a CPU idle at times (and
that, in general, is a very bad thing to do.)
