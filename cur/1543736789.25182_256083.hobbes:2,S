The alternative is to implement a flow control
mechanism between the flip buffer layer and
the tty drivers to (at the very least)
enable/disable receive interrupts.
Since the flip buffer implementation is probably
going to need rework anyways (eventually) along
with the other tty locking issues, this may not
be a trivial task.
Dropping the bytes is a simple, local fix that
will be more sane than the current
behavior of locking the machine.
A more optimized solution is likely to take a while.
