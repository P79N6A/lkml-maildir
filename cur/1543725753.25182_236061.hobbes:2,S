Right.  Aaaand if I remember correctly you may download the source
for, say, a RHEL kernel for gratis from Redhat (or a whitebox distro)
and make menuconfig it and compile it the same way you do vanilla
kernels.
In fact, a single tree is far better for stable development in general.
Vanilla things that break get spotted sooner, we avoid 2.x.0 the
syndrome, and distro kernels in general may get more eyes from clueful
people that otherwise would ignore them and leave the problems to
less resourceful users.
