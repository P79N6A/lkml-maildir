If I add a (completely bogus) IP6 address to an interface:
	# ip addr add 1234::/16 dev tap0
the route appears in /proc/net/ipv6_route. If I then delete the
address from the interface (change add to del) the route doesn't
disappear. If I add it to a different interface (say tap1) I then
have routes through both tap0 and tap1. Needless to say packets
seem to take the wrong one (Murphy's Law). I don't claim to
know anything about IPv6 routing but this *seems* wrong?
