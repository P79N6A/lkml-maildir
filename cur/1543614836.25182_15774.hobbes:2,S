This will get rid of the warning but it doesn't solve the underlying
problem of discarding the potentially useful const information. In C++,
you'd define a pair of functions to deal with this, one with and one
without const.

The ext3 macros are rather revolting, simply because they assume the
variable name. A parameterized macro might be the best compromise:
#define EXT2_I(i) (&(i->u.ext2_inode_info))
