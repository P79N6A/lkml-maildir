Subject: [regression] hp-wmi: hangs system on boot

When I first booted .29-rc2 my HP 2510p notebook hung while loading
hp-wmi, which I have listed in /etc/modules. Hard poweroff was needed.
The last line on the console was:
input: HP WMI hotkeys as /class/input/input11
After commenting out hp-wmi in /etc/modules the system booted correctly.
After the successful boot I tried loading the module manually using
modprobe, which resulted in:
input: HP WMI hotkeys as /class/input/input11
iwlagn: Radio Frequency Kill Switch is On:
Kill switch must be turned off for wireless networking to work.
wlan0: No ProbeResp from current AP 00:14:c1:38:e5:15 - assume out of range
iwlagn: Error sending REPLY_ADD_STA: enqueue_hcmd failed: -5
mac80211-phy0: failed to remove key (0, 00:14:c1:38:e5:15) from hardware (-5)
iwlagn: Error sending REPLY_ADD_STA: enqueue_hcmd failed: -5
mac80211-phy0: failed to remove key (1, ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff) from hardware (-5)
I also noticed that /sys/bus/platform/devices/hp-wmi/dock is missing.
And I lost my wireless connection.
Difference between loading hp-wmi from /etc/modules and manually could be
that normally wlan is started _after_ /etc/modules is processed. So with
the hang wlan was not yet active, while for the manual modprobe wlan was
active.
With 2.6.28 hp-wmi works perfectly.
System is running x84_64, Debian Lenny.
