I just noticed that you are *right*. I'm going over the whole recognized
PCI device list anyway, so I will just add a flag field to the struct 
ide_pci_device_s. There are at least fortunately not more then 32
different quirk types ;-).
And then the whole she-bag can be really pushed down to the
particular chipset setup file indeed.
