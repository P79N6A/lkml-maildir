Subject: [PATCH 000 of 2] knfsd: Don't allow bad file handles to cause extX to go readonly

Currently, and file handle with a bad inode number in it can cause
ext2 to go to readonly (as it looks like a corrupted filesystem)
and could allow remote access to ext3 special files like the journal.
These patches give ext2/3 their own get_dentry method which checks the
inode number early before other bits of the code can be freaked out by
it.
These are revised versions of earlier patches.  Rather than exporting
export_iget, we open code it and simplify it slightly.  This avoids
and extra module dependancy.
