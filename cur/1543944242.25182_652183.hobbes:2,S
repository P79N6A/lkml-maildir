I doubt it.  See David's previous post about constantly rebasing his
tree over the lifetime of development during a -rc series.  I do the
same thing, dropping things in the middle, re-arranging stuff, handling
merge issues that came into Linus's tree, etc.
I wouldn't want to change our current development flow to force such a
thing on Linus, or us right now.
My main point in all of this was just that you are going to have to help
with some of these merges by hand, adding patches to get things to
build, and not just blindly dropping trees when things go wrong, as you
originally stated.  After that, we can continue doing what we have been
doing in the merges with Linus, as that is working very well (see our
rate of change metrics for proof of that.)
