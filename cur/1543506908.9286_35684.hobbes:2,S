What does tcpdump show during this situation, when run on the Linux end.
Losing just a specific machine is very odd and can often point to a problem
with a switch/bridge in the middle. Its just you normally lose them when
the net is idle in that case

Look with tcpdump (you can tell it to watch one ip address only) see if
you are getting packets from the PC. If you have a sniffer for the PC client
end see if you are getting the replies. Basically you firstly need to know
where the packet disappeared
