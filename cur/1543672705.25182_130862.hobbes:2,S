This reminds me of some howto I saw somewhere of someway to
use the MTD drivers to access the unused video RAM and turn
it into swap (maybe with blkmtd?) ... probably it can be done
with that too.
I'd really love it ... I don't know if I can blame it on highmem
or not, but since I enabled it, my system 'feels' slower.
