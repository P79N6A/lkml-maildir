That's a misrepresentation. It is well-known that Linux is used in 
a wide range of embedded devices. The embedded space is very fragmented,
with lots of home-grown Linux platforms. And, I would speculate that
many of them (as well as commercial distros catering to the embedded 
market) often enable preemption (including using non-mainlined kernel 
preemption patches for 2.4 kernels).
