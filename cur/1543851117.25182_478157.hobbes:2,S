I double-checked, and of course you are right - the issues resurfaced after some
more use, even with the patch reverted.  I've written some scripts that do some
compiles from scratch, and suspend/resume several times.  Plan to try bi-secting
with that and see what that will come up with.
OTOH, from the discussion it seems just randomly pointing a finger at a patch
has uncovered some bugs - so maybe we should do this a bit more :)
