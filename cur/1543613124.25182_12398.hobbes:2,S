Well, that actually could work with things like /proc, which actually
has meaningful inode numbers. They may not be stable across reboots, of
course, nor even really stable in general, but in _theory_ there's
nothing to keep us from exporting /proc files and potentially other
virtual filesystems.
In practice I suspect there are tons of other problems, not the least of
which is that /proc doesn't give a proper filesize. 
Other not-so-kosher filesystems (ie tmpfs) might be easier than /proc in
those respects.
