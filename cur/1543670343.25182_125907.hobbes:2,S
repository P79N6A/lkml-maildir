OK, here be the fix.
I'm a bit peeved that this wasn't discovered until it hit Linus's tree. 
Weren't these patches in -mjb as well?
In the interests of SMP scalability the ext2 free blocks and free inodes
counters are "approximate".  But there is a piece of code in the Orlov
allocator which fails due to boundary conditions on really small
filesystems.
Fix that up via a final allocation pass which simply uses first-fit for
allocation of a directory inode.
