Ok, that's the first essential piece of information which is *not*
evident from the prompt "make oldconfig" presents me with:
  Ethernet (1000 Mbit) (NETDEV_1000) [Y/n] (NEW)
contains *no* indication that this is the start of a menu.

Another essential piece of information. I seem to remember other
menus which, when disabled, kept the selection status of the
options inside and just hid them from view.

That's because it's so incomplete and mentions only the facts
which where obvious in the first place. (Except for the "this
menu" part which might appear rather cryptic to users of the
curses based interface who don't see any menu.)
Have a look at the entry "config NET_ETHERNET" for an impression
of what others felt worth mentioning in similar circumstances.
And no, that is not funny, even though much of it is of course
fundamentally basic for most of us. It does actually help people
confronted with the question.

Point is, without grepping through the Kconfig the user has no
way of knowing that the question comes from a menuconfig in the
first place, at least with "make menuconfig" and friends, and
without grepping through the Makefile (and, à la limite, source
files) s/he cannot be sure the option doesn't directly affect
code generation.
Thanks,
