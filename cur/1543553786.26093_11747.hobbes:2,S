I'm running 2.2.17 vanilla on a UP x86 box, and getting occasionally a
couple of 'VM: do_try_to_free_pages failed' messages.
The system appears to be running perfectly. It's almost out of real RAM,
but has about 100M swap unused.
I can't figure out how this happens. Specifically, how come the call to
swap_out in do_try_to_free_pages didn't swap something out, return true,
and avoid that message being printed?
kswapd is not acting up in any way; the system doesn't appear to be OOM.
If this isn't a bug then can we remove this printk'd message?
If it does seem to be a bug and someone'll give me a crash course on this
area of the VM I'll investigate further. I notice do_try_to_free_pages can
be called either from kswapd, or under what look like memory-pressure
conditions elsewhere.
I'm not on lkml, so please cc me on any replies.
