Subject: [PATCH v2 0/6] SystemACE: rework and of_platform bus binding patches
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here is a set of rework patches on the Xilinx SystemACE driver which ends
in the addition of an of_platform bus binding.  The of_platform bus binding
is needed to use the driver from arch/powerpc.  SystemACE is most commonly
used in Xilinx Virtex system (ppc405).
Jens, I'm hoping I can get these changes in for 2.6.24.  Assuming nobody
raises any issues, can you please merge these into your tree?
Thanks,
g.
