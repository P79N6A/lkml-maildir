Mine is quite recent:

Indeed, both are confusing (the other way is having permission that you
do not see). But which one is the most dangerous from a security point
of view? For me it is believing that you're protected while you're not.

I've read that 64 bit processors have an execute bit at the page level
while 32 bit ones do not (only at the segment level). I didn't know that
newer 31 bit CPUs did have this bit.

I'd be happy to know how to enable it.
Thanks for your help.
