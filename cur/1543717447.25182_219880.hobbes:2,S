Question?  Is fsck specified to be able to be crashed? I'm not
sure you could ever make a repair-tool that could do that unless
there was some "guaranteed to save device" on an independent power
source during the repair. Fsck can't commit partial fixes of some
stuff because it would leave the file-system in an unrecoverable
state. It needs to complete.
Judging by the number of Stanford people being copied, I would
guess that this is a troll-probe?
Cheers,
