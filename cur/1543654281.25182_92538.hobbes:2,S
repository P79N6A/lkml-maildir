Not good! Not good!
Booted fine with no oops or DRI init errors while starting X.
and the quake3 test, alas:
- went into 640x480 correctly but would not display the opening movie;
- keyboard stopped responding and I had to hard-shutdown.
- i was wearing headphones too and I got some big static from my sound card :X
Looked okay, but it seems to not work all the way.
Compiling the driver gave me lots of warnings which I am not entirely sure appear in the kernels before those affected:
