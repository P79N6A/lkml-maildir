I think we agreed, that there seem to be no alternatives.
Tytso said, that fuse_allow_task() thing is basically OK, but there
should be some method to make certain tasks excempt from this
limitation.  I agree, with this, but I think there should be at least
one (preferably more) users who actually need this, before I start
thinking about implementing it.
Making a mount be excepmt is already possible with the 'allow_other'
(privileged by default) mount option.
