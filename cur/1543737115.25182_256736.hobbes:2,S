Subject: USB storage crash report in 2.6 SMP

Copying a large amount of datas (several gigabytes) between two USB 2.0 attached
disks will crash any Linux 2.6 SMP kernel, including 2.6.9-rc3.
The stack report is:
qh_completions 0x7B/0x118 [ehci_hcd]
scan_async
ehci_work
echi_irq
handle_IRQ_event
commnon_interrupt
default_idle
default_idle
cpu_idle
The crash will append on any attempt to copy something like 100 GB.
Copying something like 1 GB or less works nicely.
Switching to an UP kernel solves the problem.
Switching to a 2.4 kernel solves the problem.
I tested it on two different machines, with two different disks sets.
