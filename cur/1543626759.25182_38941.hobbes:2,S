Using any ide related bootprompt causes the dreaded
	Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the kernel.  *[HANG]*
with a *non-PCI* based kernel.  I traced it down to the early call to
ide_init_default_hwifs that a bootprompt causes to happen, but I sort
of lost interest once I tracked it down to the IDE code :)  Happens 
with 2.5.8pre2, 2.5.7 and possibly earlier kernels as well.
Paul.
