Are you sure? AFAICS, the intermezzo code assumes that ngroups/groups
won't change while you inside the intermezzo layer itself. Look at the
way they stuff current->ngroups into the record 'size', then do the
actual copy in journal_log_prefix()...

It doesn't have to be fatal in order to be a security risk. The kernel
simply does not know whether or not formula A (random combination of
uid/gid/groups) will be secure as opposed to the before/after states.

spinlocking is designed so as to invalidate the processor caches.
