the previous non-Rik VM kernel (other then the current linus tree) is the
2.2 kernels, and they are lacking a LOT of features that are in 2.4
it's not a case of wanting to run 2.4.latest on production, it's a matter
of wanting to run 2.4.anything on production. currently this is a serious
problem to do becouse the VM system has not been stable and predictable
enough to be trusted. there have been to many cases of people putting 2.4
on a production system and it slowing to a crawl when the real production
load hits.
when 2.4 works it is FAR better then 2.2 and it has features not available
on 2.2, but with the Rik VM (versions that were in the linus kernels up
through 2.4.9) it has not reliably worked. running 2.4 is not supposed to
be bleading edge, it's supposed to be the stable kernel series (although
you do have to wait a few days after a kernel is released to avoid paper
bag bugs :-)
if we want a kernel series that should not be used in production servers
we need to get 2.4 stable enough to be used there and then we can open the
2.5 series
