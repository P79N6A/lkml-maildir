they work only if you specify a device. Which is logical if you have more
than one device, it is less so, if you have only one.

you need to give -I eth1 like it is decribed in the ping6 manpage:
     -I interface address
              Set source address to specified interface  address.  Argu­
              ment  may  be  numeric  IP address or name of device. When
              pinging IPv6 link-local address this option is required.
