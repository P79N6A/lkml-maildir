Minor correction, it is compatible with it... Otherwise, you seem to grasp
the
fundamentals and have an idea of the problem at hand.
Your concern is addressed thusly with defvs:
	- The driver supporting the hot-plug hw sees the *thing* you just
plugged in...
	- Registers a device node{s} into the namespace by *NAME* & it gets
	  backwards compatible maj/mins if needed/desired.
	- *poof* is is in the /dev implicitely
If the bus has to be probed periodically, it can be triggered in userspace.
I am not aware how this currently happens. USB/PCMCIA folks help here?
