Hi,
> vgacon. How do I choose mdacon?
   You can choose in kernel configuration, but mdacon works only for
MDA used as a secondary display.
   Anyway, can you try putting return at the start of the vgacon_cursor()
function in drivers/video/vgacon.c and check if it fixes your cursor
problems?
				Have a nice fortnight
