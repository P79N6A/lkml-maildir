Subject: [PATCH] Store the relevant miscdevice in file->private_data in misc_open()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Currently it's not easy to share file_operations between multiple
instances of a miscdevice. In order to do this, the device code needs to
store a list of all it's miscdevice instances, and when fops->open() is
called, search the list and find the right device based on the minor
number.
However the generic miscdevice code already has a list of miscdevices,
and uses this to find the right device in misc_open(). If misc_open()
would store the miscdevice it found in file->private_data, then the
device code wouldn't need to worry about storing it's own separate list
and searching that as well.
The rest of the miscdevice code does not use file->private_data, so the
device code is still free to use file->private_data for something else
if it wants to.

I'm not all that across VFS or driver core stuff, but this looks safe to
me, lots of other devices use file->private_data and this should be no
different AFAICT.
