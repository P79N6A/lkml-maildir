please send me your current sched-clock.c, i'll redo any remaining 
cleanups.
But ... i find your approach curious, why didnt you just apply the 
cleanups i sent? You clearly started working on this as a reaction to my 
cleanup patches and to the bugfixes i sent ontop of the cleanup patches. 
Your "I'll do this differently" approach is totally unnecessary from a 
commit management point of view (this is new code after all and 
will/should go upstream in a single clean chunk anyway), the only effect 
this has is that that you are discouraging contributors like me from 
contributing cleanups to the x86_64 tree.
To further underline this feeling i got, none of your reactions to any 
of my patches showed even a single positive thought that you are happy 
about people fixing code you are introducing (in fact you didnt even 
indicate which patch you took, only at my repeated prodding did you say 
anything about the cleanup patch i sent!), so to me the impression is 
that deep in yourself you are (subconsciously) not happy about others 
contributing to the x86_64 tree. Please tell me that i'm wrong :-(
