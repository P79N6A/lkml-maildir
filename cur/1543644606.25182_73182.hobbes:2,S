It is obvious that in high end systems you MUST have per user scheduling 
since users will rob each other of cycles.... If Linux is to be a general 
purpose operation system it MUST have this feature (otherwise it will only be 
considered fit for lower end systems) and trusting your users at this no 
better than trusting your users when they promise you they will not seg fault 
or peek into memory pages which are not theirs. It simply isn't done. 
Besides, using the CPU in an abusive manner could happen as a result of a bug 
as much as a result of malicious intent (exactly like a segfault).
Ok. Here's an idea. Why not have both ?!?
There is no real reason why I should have per user scheduling on my machine 
at home (I don't really need a just devision of labour between the root user 
and myself which are almost the only users to use my system). Why not have 
the deault compilation of the kernel be without per user scheduling and 
enable it for high end systems (like a university machine where all the 
students are at each others throats for a few CPU cycles...) ? So how about 
making this a compile option and let the users decide what they like ?
