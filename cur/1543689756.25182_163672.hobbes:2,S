I was wondering when/how often do updates take place to this driver?
I have an Intel i875 chipset and was wondering when it would be possible
to use AGPGART/etc (to use GLX/3D stuff).
CONFIG_AGP_INTEL:
This option gives you AGP support for the GLX component of the
XFree86 4.x on Intel 440LX/BX/GX, 815, 820, 830, 840, 845, 850 and 860
chipsets.
You should say Y here if you use XFree86 3.3.6 or 4.x and want to
use GLX or DRI.  If unsure, say N.
