Subject: [PATCH]: minor bug at schedule()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi
        I have found that we run botton handlers (in schedule()) when
we are in the middle of an interrupt.  I think that is illegal, and
moved the test to the beginning of the function.  In the case that the
running of the bottom handlers before the test is on purpose, could
somebody put a comment there, please.
I also remove an unneeded return.
Later, Juan.
