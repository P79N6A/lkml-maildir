Sparse has a notion of "integer constant expression" already, which it
uses to validate expressions used for things like bitfield widths or
array sizes.  I could easily have Sparse warn on any use of an integer
constant expression as an operand of || or &&.  However, I can imagine
that that might lead to some false positives when intentionally using
an integer constant expression in a condition and expecting the
compiler to optimize it out at compile time.
