Ok, looks good too. It would be interesting to convert the media-bay
stuff to use hotplug now too :) But that mean some serious work on swim3
and ide-pmac to make them more hotplug friendly... Not sure it's worth
the pain. The current mecanism actually works, even if it's not pretty,
and mediabay-based machines are a thing of the past.
