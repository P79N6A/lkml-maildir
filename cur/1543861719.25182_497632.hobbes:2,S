Yup. it's the freeze_bdev/thaw_bdev use of the bd_mount_mutex()
that's the problem. I fail to see _why_ we need to hold a lock
across the freeze/thaw - the only reason i can think of is to
hold out new calls to sget() (via get_sb_bdev()) while the
filesystem is frozen though I'm not sure why you'd need to
do that. Can someone explain why we are holding the lock from
freeze to thaw?
FWIW, the comment in get_sb_bdev() seems to imply s_umount is supposed
to ensure that we don't get unmounted while frozen.
Indeed, in the comment above freeze_bdev:
 * If a superblock is found on this device, we take the s_umount semaphore
 * on it to make sure nobody unmounts until the snapshot creation is done.
implies this as well, but freeze_bdev does not take the s_umount
semaphore, nor does any filesystem that implements ->write_super_lockfs()
So the code is clearly at odds with the comments here.
IMO, you should be able to unmount a frozen filesystem - behaviour
should be the same as crashing while frozen, so i think the comments
about "snapshots" are pretty dodgy as well.

Userspace knows nothing about that lock, so we can change that without
changing the the userspace API.
Cheers,
Dave.
