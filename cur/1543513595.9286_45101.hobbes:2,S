No. Your source tree or your include symlinks are hosed. 
Do 
rm /usr/include/linux 
ln -s ../src/linux/include/linux /usr/include/linux 
then retry. If that does not help, reinstall the linux source tree. 
PLUS: your current Linux source directory MUST be named /usr/src/linux (or this
needs to be a symlink to your Linux source directory)!
