Hi,
maybe a newbie question, but I don't know how to interpret.
I have a local lan, 3 machines connected. On all three I run LinuxPPC5
but with different kernels.
Machine1: kernel 2.2.6 24MB
Machine2: kernel 2.2.13pre4 80MB
Machine3: kernel 2.2.12 96MB
I saw that machine2 got very slow on X, so I exited X an pressed the
mystic shift+scr-lock key. I saw there that I had about 343848 network
buffer allocations. On the other machines I didn't run X only console.
There I had number about 1000 nba's. 
So my question, is this the total number of allocations ever made during
uptime or do I have to worry about?
And how can I get a the shift-scr-lock output into a file?
Sorry if this is basics
Andreas
