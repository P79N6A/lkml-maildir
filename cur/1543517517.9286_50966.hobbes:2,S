I have to write a device driver for a machine which does not have
hardware enforced 
cache coherency between bus master devices and the CPU caches.  Is there
a way to allocate certain buffers in uncached memory.  I know this 
would lower performance, but it would also solve certain problems which
seem to be cropping up.
Please reply to
