Entropy is gathered from interrupt timing in the kernel because
interrupts are handled in the kernel.  It would be quite difficult for
a user space process to get accurate information about interrupt
timing.
However, the i8xx RNG and audio entropy daemons work perfectly well
from user space.  What is gained by moving that code into the kernel?
Best,
