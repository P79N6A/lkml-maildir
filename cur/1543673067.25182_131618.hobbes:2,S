That is interesting. Someone sent a SCSI command the it really didn't
like. This isn't a dell 8100 or similar laptop is it btw ?

I guess people with raw drive access should learn to program as well. You
could play with drive->quiet I guess (I think its drive->quiet) but right
now the IDE layer has no notion of how severe an error is although it has
some idea who caused it. For 2.5.x passing quiet/loud in the taskfile is
a viable extension for 2.4 its not so clear how you would do it nicely.
