The main problem Linux clone has over LWPs is the extensive memory resource
usage (~8.5K on x86, 16+somethingK on 64bit for the kernel stacks)
To solve that it would be very nice to have Mach like continuations in 
Linux (multiple kernel threads sharing a kernel stack) 
Also the LinuxThreads library does horrible things at pthread_create time,
like doing a full context switch to the manager thread and cloning from
there (mostly to work around signal/waitpid() problems in the kernel)
