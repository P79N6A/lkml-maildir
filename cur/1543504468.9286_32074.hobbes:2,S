Hi folks, again news 
as Roger Larrson suspected, there are some parts in the kernel
which have a too long execution path:
On his PPro with 512MB RAM, d_lookup takes up to 80ms to execute !
(I put Roger's latency profiling patch on my page)
I tested this on my PII400 (UP box) + 256MB RAM:
The test-kernel was 2.2.10 + a buffer.c patch (from Andrea) + uaccess.h 
(from Mingo) patch, which insert additional schedule() calls. 
I made 3 tests, booting with mem=64m ,  mem=128m and mem=256m
the audio buffer was 4.35ms ( 3x256 bytes)
the results are very interesting: (look at the diagrams !)
mem=64m  :
 /proc stress  3.5ms latency  0 overruns  (this is VERY good !)
 disk write:  12.5ms latency 18 overruns
 disk copy:   11.1ms latency 14 overruns
 disk read:    6.3ms latency 16 overruns  (quite nice :-) )

mem=128m  :
 /proc stress  5.4ms latency  102 overruns  
 disk write:  14.5ms latency   20 overruns
 disk copy:   11.4ms latency   43 overruns
 disk read:   10.5ms latency    7 overruns

+patch+128mb/3x256.html
mem=256m  :
 /proc stress  9.2ms latency  101 overruns  
 disk write:  48.7ms latency   13 overruns
 disk copy:   31.6ms latency   24 overruns
 disk read:   11.9ms latency    4 overruns

IMHO having less memory , leads to  less mem for disk buffering, 
and less pages to process, so the kernel routines take less time
go through lists, inodes etc.
I hope that the delay of the release of Mingo's patch is related to
the fact that he tries to shorten these paths, which is not always a trivial
task.
Mingo, can you confirm this ?
comments ?
ciao,
Benno.
