I'm afraid there is no linux driver for that card.
Agilent calls HPFC-5000C as "Classic Tachyon".
"drivers/net/fc" is a driver that controls Classic Tachyon.
But I don't know whether it works as SCSI driver.
(I'm afraid it doesn't.)
Basically, it's a driver for Interphase 5526 PCI FC card.
Classic Tachyon has a TSI(Tachyon System Interface) bus.
So every Classic Tachyon based PCI-HBA has its own bus bridge chip.
Interphase's bridge chip was called as i-chip.
If HHBA-5000A uses a i-chip as a bridge, you might be able to use
that driver.
Are there any Interphase logo on HHBA-5000A?

cpqfc is a driver for Tachyon TL/TS(HPFC-51xx), XL2(HPFC-5200) and
DX2(HPFC-5400).
