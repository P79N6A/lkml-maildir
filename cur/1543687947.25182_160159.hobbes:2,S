There are two reasons while it shouldn't have a NULL check. One,
persistency: the other str*() functions don't do this sort of check.
Two, for general uses like that:
     new_name = strdup(name);
     if (!new_name)
         goto allocation_failed;
	 
With this check, NULL would be returning from strdup() either because 
name == NULL or when the allocation fails. You cannot simply pass that 
information through its return value and the caller would need to 
check whether name == NULL by itself which should have been done anyway.
Passing NULL to strdup() is a bug, which would have NOT show as an
Oops if you add this check, and that is bad. Maybe it would be worth 
to add a BUG_ON(s == NULL) instead, and perhaps also add this to the 
other str*() functions, but that is a different patch.
