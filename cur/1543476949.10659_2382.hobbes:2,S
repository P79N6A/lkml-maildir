There are one or two version of the VIA chipsets on FIC mainboards
that has a history of eating the BIOS.  Yes, that is exactly what I said,
too.  So I asked the system builder/techie again, repeat that one more
time.
I will have to ask him what the exact board model and application of the
the chipset revision for a possible candidate for the quirk list.
Hey Jim,
What is the model of that FIC VIA board that eats the BIOS and is fuzzy
with the IDE-controller?
