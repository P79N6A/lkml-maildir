Looks like this API was added in Aug03. A quick grep through the tree
shows only <10 users. Are there patches pending to convert others, or
are you just having new stuff do this? I know of at least one sysfs
driver (edd) that uses snprintf() that could be converted. I'll send an
updated patch shortly for smbios.c, just curious.
