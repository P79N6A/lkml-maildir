Well, I think there is probably some arch code that uses 16-bit
that might use a null pointer, or at least a struct that starts
at the 0 address, which would have problems.  I think it would
be better to avoid that issue just in case, especially since
this optimization does not save anything in the case of properly
written code.

If we could turn off the optimization and add a warning, I
would support that.  Even if we could only add the warning, then
at least people would know.
