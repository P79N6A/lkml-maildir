Actually, if you guys would design something a littler newer than circa
1973 for your buffer cache design, things would be easier.  The buffer
cache acts this way becuase it is based on a PRIMITIVE design that's not
far off from the textbook description found in "UNIX:  a practical
implementation."  Novell was doing mirroring and distributed mirroring
since about 1984.  We are just trying to get linux closer to the 1990's.
