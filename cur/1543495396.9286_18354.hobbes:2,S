   I'm pretty sure it's a hardware problem -- the lowest bit of the base
address register (which says whether it's a memory region or an I/O
region) must be hard-wired and thus not changeable by the software.
[PCI specs, section 6.2.5.1]
   So it's either the card having the region type bit erroneously writeable
or some hardware glitch causing the bit to be misread (highly improbable).
You could try `setpci -H1 -s 02:09.0 18.l=f0000000 18.l' to test the
first possibility.
				Have a nice fortnight
