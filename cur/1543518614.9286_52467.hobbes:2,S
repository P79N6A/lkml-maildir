well, this is perfectly possible with the current zone allocator (check
out how build_zonelists() builds dynamic allocation paths). I dont see
much point in it though, it might prevent fragmentation to a certain
degree, but i dont think it is a fair use of memory resources. (i'm pretty
sure the atomic zone would stay unused most of the time) But you might
want to try it out - just pass many small zones in free_area_init_core()
and modify build_zonelists() to have private and isolated zones for
GFP_ATOMIC, etc.
the SLAB is completely different as it has micro-units of a few pages. A
zoned allocator must work on a larger scale, and cannot afford wasting
memory on the order of those larger units.
