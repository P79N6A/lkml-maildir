The "LRU" bits there don't actually describe the homebrew algorithm.

I'm looking at 2.6.12-rc6-mm1.
As far as I can tell new active pages are added to the ->next component
of the head of the active list in lru_cache_add_active() and the ->next
component of the head of the inactive list in lru_cache_add(). Then
isolate_lru_pages() dequeues from ->prev of the head of the inactive
list in shrink_cache() and isolate_lru_pages() dequeues from the ->prev
of the active list in refill_inactive_zone().
