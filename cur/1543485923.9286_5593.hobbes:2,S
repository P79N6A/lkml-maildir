You mean you changed the contents of a shared library while it was being
used?  It's not surprising that this broke things!  FWIW, I suspect it
would have worked if it unlinked/renamed the old libs and then placed the
new, but it's hard to make this an atomic operation.
This isn't an ld.so bug.  If you modified the image of any program while it
was running (say, by moving the entry point to fputs 16 bytes earlier)
you would expect it to run erratically.  Or just limp.  If it ran at all.
