True.  Somebody had just said something quite similar, which undoubtedly
is what brought the thought to mind.  However, it is a stupid problem,
and all of the arguments have already been done to death.  Nothing
remains to be said, and the sensible strategy now is just to work around
the stupid blocks and ignore any fools who care to howl.  Also, working
around the blocks serves as a useful object lesson to everybody who has
forgotten that the point of the GPL is to provide freedom to innovate
and change, not to restrict it.
Just do it.
