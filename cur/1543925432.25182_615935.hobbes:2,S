If you do that, then things like randconfigs will randomly break if you
happen to use a toolchain targetted specifically at i386 or so.
randconfigs are pretty useful for testing, it would be nice to have a
facility to keep these working without having to have a script grep the
.config to figure out which toolchain prefix to use.
This is one of the things I've been wondering about with an sh/sh64
unification, as we have no option but having completely different
toolchains, and CONFIG_64BIT=y won't work there when they are both
using a 32-bit ABI.
