Ok, this seems feature complete. Both nonlinear swapping and prio_tree
are available now. I believe objrmap-core+anon-vma+prio_tree can be
merged into mainline after a bit more of testing, certainly they looks
good enough for -mm.
As usual this work wouldn't been possible without the efforts of Hugh
Dickins, Dave McCracken, and last but not the least Rajesh
Venkatasubramanian.
As usual I'm writing this on my desktop while running this kernel and it
swaps fine (uptime still 10 minutes though ;).
after some misc swapping (desktop like load) this is the profiling:
724627 total                                      0.2810
613729 default_idle                             9589.5156

  3986 do_no_page                                 2.1853
  2679 unmap_page_range                           3.4171

   720 probe_irq_on                               2.2500
the prio_tree funcs are at the end, this is expected since I have normal
load:
    14 prio_tree_insert                           0.0203
     8 prio_tree_first                            0.0185
     6 prio_tree_remove                           0.0179
     4 __vma_prio_tree_insert                     0.0139
     4 prio_tree_next                             0.0081
     2 __vma_prio_tree_remove                     0.0054
the db simulator is running fine on the test box too.

Files 2.6.5-rc2-aa2/extraversion and 2.6.5-rc2-aa3/extraversion differ
Files 2.6.5-rc2-aa2/objrmap-core.gz and 2.6.5-rc2-aa3/objrmap-core.gz differ
	Fixup locking in swapoff, and microscalability optimization
	in do_munmap. Both from the original objrmap patch from Dave McCracken.
Only in 2.6.5-rc2-aa3: prio-tree.gz
	Drop computational complexity of swapping using objrmap, using
	a prio tree for efficient search of the vma-ranges mapping
	any given page in an inode. From Rajesh Venkatasubramanian.
