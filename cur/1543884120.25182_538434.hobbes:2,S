        There problem here is the same - our target chips are not
just ASICs. It just happens that the one we start with called such,
but we have different ones too. It's still important that they contain
blocks with different functionality, and drivers we propose deal with
basic, common functionality of chips. Now that it was pointed out that
there's place in the tree for such drivers, it would be not wise to
try to create another one.
