A lot of USB drivers implement sysfs attributes and then to something like this:
static ssize_t show_tabletProductId(struct device *dev, char *buf)
{
        struct aiptek *aiptek = dev_get_drvdata(dev);
        if (aiptek == NULL)
                return 0;
        return snprintf(buf, PAGE_SIZE, "0x%04x\n",
                        aiptek->inputdev->id.product);
}
aiptek structure is freed in aiptek_disconnect. It is possible that
CPU1 just passed that aiptek==NULL check and the task gets
rescheduled. Second CPU will do disconnect and kfree(aiptek).
You really need a semaphore in USB driver core to make sure that
device is not taken from you and that the driver that is bound to the
device is still the same.
