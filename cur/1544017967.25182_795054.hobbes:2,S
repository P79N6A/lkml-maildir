Subject: [PATCH] ieee1394: ohci1394: increase AT req. retries, fix ack_busy_X from Panasonic camcorders and others
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Camcorders have a tendency to fail read requests to their config ROM and
write request to their FCP command register with ack_busy_X.  This has
become a problem with newer kernels and especially Panasonic camcorders,
causing AV/C in dvgrab and kino to fail.  Dvgrab for example frequently
logs "send oops"; kino reports loss of AV/C control.  I suspect that
lower CPU scheduling latencies in newer kernels made this issue more
prominent in current kernels.
According to
https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=114103&aid=2492640&group_id=14103
this can be fixed by configuring the FireWire controller for more
hardware retries for request transmission; these retries are evidently
more successful than libavc1394's own retry loop (typically 3 tries on
top of hardware retries).
Presumably the same issue has been reported at
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=449252
 and
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=477279
 .
