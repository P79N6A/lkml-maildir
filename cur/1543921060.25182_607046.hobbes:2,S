It actually never went away, some of the wronger reports went away such
as counting a commented statement as a single statement.  The check for
length didn't make the cut for 0.11, as I was still thinking about
whether we wanted a subjective check on statements over and above the
"real" check for lines.

Yes and the comment in there actually counts as a statement for counting
statement purposes.  
The plan is to move to counting lines and only winge on exactly one
line.  I have half a mind to make a subjective check on statements and a
full check on lines.  But probabally it will just move to lines.

Indeed.  We should probabally do more on the indentation checks in
general.  The current direct check for:
	if (foo);
		bar();
Could probabally be generalised to look for this kind of error:
	if (foo)
		bar();
		baz();
	one();
