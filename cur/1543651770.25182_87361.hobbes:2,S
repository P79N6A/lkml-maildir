Before 2.4, the NMI watchdog was only available for SMP boxes,
since it used the I/O APIC to send NMIs to the CPUs. Then the
ability to use the *local* APIC on UP machines was introduced,
and with it the ability to drive the NMI watchdog from the CPU
itself, via performance counter overflow interrupts.
The NMI watchdog still supports both these modes of operation.
Typically, the performance counter + local APIC mode kicks in
when (a) you asked for it, or (b) you asked for the I/O APIC
mode but it wasn't available.
