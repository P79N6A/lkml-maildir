Where is the linux ata web site. I am looking to get a Western Digital
HD #WD200BB and want to know if their are any issues with this drive
especially DMA. This drive is for an old Pentium 133 box with I think a
ata/66 controller onboard while this drive is ata/100, any problems? 
This box is only a firewall/NAT.
