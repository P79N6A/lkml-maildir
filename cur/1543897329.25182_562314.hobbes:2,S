It did occur to me that someone might be doing something crazy like
branching to code that's not in the kernel/module text - but I was
hoping that wouldn't be the case. I'm not sure what ITCM is?

There's jprobe code in net/ipv4/tcp_probe.c and net/dccp/probe.c that
can be builtin or modular, so I think kernel_text_address() is right.
