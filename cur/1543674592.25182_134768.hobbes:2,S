Well, I Don't think this really is a fix, it's just a workaround for a problen 
introduced with ChangeSet@1.1167.
With that the definition of SET_MODULE_OWNER was removed from the file 
include/linux/module.h and an empty one was added to the file 
include/linux/netdevice.h.
This was done because the 'owner' field was removed from the 'struct 
net_device'. This broke all other places where SET_MODULE_OWNER was also 
used...
I made the attached patch against 2.5.69-mm8 that adds the original definition 
back to include/linux/module.h and removes all the places where it must not 
be called anymore due to the missing owner field...
I hope this was the real intention of the ChangeSet mentioned above, and I did 
not miss any false occurrence. (The most SET_MODULE_OWNER calls are now in 
the isdn subtree)
For me it compiles and works fine... ;-)

Best regards, too...

P.S.: Sorry that I had to GZIP the patch, but else it would have been too 
large...
