What you're missing is this:
/dev/random's entropy counting scheme sole reason to exist is to
defend against theoretical future attacks against its cryptographic
primitives. Thus _any_ discussion of its correctness must perforce be
theoretical.
By substituting CRC-16 for SHA1, I've simply brought the future 
attack we're concerned about to today.
As I said at the beginning of this thread, I'm perfectly happy to
continue taking samples from network devices. My concerns are entirely
with how we account their entropy, which is strictly in the realm of
theory to start with.
I will instead change the entropy estimator to be more conservative
and to note the presence of high resolution clocks so that we can feed
it garbage more safely.
