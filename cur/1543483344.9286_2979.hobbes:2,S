Um, this is difficult, given that the same virtual->physical mapping
may be present in multiple processes.  Which pid do I use?
I think that assigning a colour to the vm_area_struct would be better.
You *would* have essentially random relationships between the colour offsets
of the various vm_area_structs in a process (text, data, stack).
Erm, I just thought of COW issues.  which arise because the data
segment is mapped COW from the backing file.  Do the cow-copied pages
have different colour offsets then the pages htey're copied from?
I can see disadvnatages to both possible answers.
