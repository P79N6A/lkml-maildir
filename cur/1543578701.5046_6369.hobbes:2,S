Yes corruption verses deadlock that can wack superblock....hummm
Two evils, mame or kill one or leave both active...

Linus we are talking about blacklisting every PIIX4 that is 440BX/GX/LX/NX 
in this case and that is a major list.  VIA has its own problems and that
need special cases attention by one person work on always, thus the
poor^H^H^H^H bold sucker^H^H^H^H^H^H guy known as Vojtech Pavlik from SuSE
is having to much fun....
