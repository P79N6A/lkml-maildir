I have reviewed my logs and I find the following repeated over and over
just before a system crash:
Mar 18 02:41:08 growler kernel: EXT2-fs error (device 08:13):
ext2_check_blocks_bitmap: Wrong free blocks count for group 366, stored
= 7921, counted = 3304
Then at the end of these I see:
Mar 18 02:41:08 growler kernel: EXT2-fs error (device 08:13):
ext2_check_inodes_bitmap: Wrong free inodes count in super block, stored
= 718670, counted = 699273

Mar 18 02:41:08 growler kernel: CD-ROM I/O error: dev 0b:00, sector 64
Mar 18 02:41:08 growler kernel: isofs_read_super: bread failed,
dev=0b:00, iso_blknum=16, block=32
Mar 18 02:41:08 growler kernel: Unable to identify CD-ROM format.
This happened with an audio CD in the drive. SCSI device id 1 is the
CDROM drive.  I don't understand why EXT2-fs is complaining about a CD. 
Even if this were a data CD, EXT2-fs shouldn't even be involved (iso9660
filesystem).
These errors caused me to lose two partitions on my SCSI disk (fsck
fscked them to lost+found).  Anyone have ideas as to what is happening
here?
