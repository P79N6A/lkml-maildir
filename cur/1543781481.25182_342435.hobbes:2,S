Ingo,
I just compiled it and got a bunch of uninitialized variable warnings.
Are you sure you want this?  Here's the problem.
In something like _trace_cmdline we have:
static void notrace _trace_cmdline(int cpu, struct cpu_trace *tr)
{
	unsigned long flags;
	raw_local_save_flags(flags);
	____trace(cpu, TRACE_CMDLINE, tr, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, flags);
}
Now the raw_local_save_flags is defined as:
do { typecheck(unsigned long,flags); \
    if (raw_irqs_disabled_flags(flags)) \
        trace_irqs_off(); else trace_irqs_on(); \
        __raw_local_save_flags(flags); } while (0)
The test of raw_irqs_disabled_flags is checking an uninitialized
variable.  I haven't tried to run it yet since this just doesn't look
good.
I changed it for now to the following, but it still desn't make sense to
me.  With a local_save_flags, which doesn't disable or restore the
interrupts, why bother with the trace at all?
