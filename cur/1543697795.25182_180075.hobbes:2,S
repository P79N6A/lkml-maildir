Dan,
 not sure about the group. Maybe it is just that nobody has a good
answer. I was having similar problems with regard to another Tachyon
[XL2]based HP card.Lack of Linux support prevented basically a working
dual-boot solution (HP-UX vs. Linux) on couple of rx5670 boxes.
 At that time a nice folk at HP basically told me that: "it could be
done, but we are looking for funding one or two consultants".
 One of the problems involved seems to be documentation on the Tachyon
chips. As usual.  Another reason (for those liking conspiracy theories)
might be market(ing) segmentation by HP. But I'm just being paranoid
here :-)

PS: have a look at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/cpqfc
 - but I fear
it is not very actively maintained :-(
