I think it is better to not change the default behaviour. You risk
breaking programs and there are much more that use ptrace than just gdb.

I think it would be better to just define a new ptrace singlestep command
with the new semantics instead of adding options.

Have you actually seen this in practice?

Sounds like a bug. Can you submit a change for that separately?
