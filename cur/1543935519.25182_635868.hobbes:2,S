You can pretty much generalize this to many patches on many mailing
lists.. Someone submits a patch that they didn't think about, and ..
It's at least a learning experience for the person submitting the patch.
It does however seem a lot less likely someone will screw up a change
when checkpatch.pl actually tells you the line where the style problem
is, and what it is .. Even with "WARNING" and "ERROR" classifications.

There is a maintainer involved in all this .. The maintainer needs to
accept the patch prior to it "... screwing up other developers." Given a
sane maintainer, and a sane list review then why wouldn't a pure clean
up be accepted?
The warning message is actually an end run around the maintainer.. The
clean up never gets created, and the maintainer doesn't have the choice
to include it or not..
