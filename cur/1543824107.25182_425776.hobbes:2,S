Some feedback claims this is not the case and that "it's unmaintained,
rarely well-tested, and may still need changes for some forthcoming
JVM stuff. and the tools aren't yet at 1.0".
Given that it should probably stay EXPERIMENTAL for now.  I wonder if
left unmaintained for much longer if it should be potentially marked
BROKEN and/or scheduled for removal?
MAINTAINERS claims it is maintained, if that is not long the case I'm
happy post a trivial patch to change that.  Or perhaps we can find a
new maintainer?
