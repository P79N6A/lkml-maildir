See boot.msg attached, see .config file attached.
I intended to boot with vga16fb to see the nice penguin and later try to load
clgenfb since my Videochip (CL GD 7543) isn't supposed to work with it yet.
However I deactivated clgenfb and the problem persisted.

I don't know since I need PCMCIA. If you want me to try exactly this, please
tell me.
(Constantly Rebooting my poor Terminal isn't a nice option at work)
I suspect the enabled 'text mode console' disables vga16fb ... but that used
to work some time ago ... (2.3.16 or so).
However (to Alan):
- the pcmcia_core module doesn't know about versioning (it asks for
__check_region), hmm that is not totally true, at the same time it asks for
__release_region_Rd49501d4 and __release_region.
CardServices_Re4eef0a4 is defined, CardServices is undefined. Looks like
symbol versioning is screwed up.
- I experienced a full lockup while examining the output of
/sbin/init.d/pcmcia start (missing symbols).
Magic Key non functional. I have no clue. And that I unplugged the Laptop to
heat tea-water (same plug) shouldn't have caused that - I do that several
times a day (though with 2.2 and APM enabled).
Well,
    Lets see how it handles next release
