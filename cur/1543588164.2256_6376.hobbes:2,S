Just alone the fact that you as number one submitter of LVM-bugfixes since
at least 0.8 do not get CVS write access is a sign of closedness for me.
But we discussed that on the sistina list.

100% True.  A few days ago I looke at the LVM patches to see what parts
of it could be fed to Linus in small pieces - but it's such a _huge_
mixture of bugfixes, cleanups and move-arounds that it looks pretty
much impossible.

IMHO wou should just put _your_ tree on a sever and submit it (in pieces)
to Linus.  AFAIK all serious users of LVM have used you're patched versions.
Maybe openlvm is a good hood for such a project?

Yes - when looking at what code they produces it looks a _lot_ cleaner than
Linux-LVM and while the papers had serious signs of Overengeering the
actual code looks very good to me - it could just get a little better
integrated with the main kernel, but that's a 2.5 issue.

Of course it doesn't work. We've performed a software upgrade.
