If you don't go away from linux, OK.
Really:
char = 8bit
long int = 32 or 64, depending on arch
long long = 64 bits
int = ??? almost anything, depending on arch and compiler.
Run DOS on your P4, with an old compiler, and int defaults to 16 bits.
I think the same also happens for Win16.
int is defined ad the native word size of the hardware+OS.
