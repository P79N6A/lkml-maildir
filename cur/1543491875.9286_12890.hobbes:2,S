I think I seen this before.
I just built 2.2.5 without CONFIG_PACKET.
I understand CONFIG_PACKET is necessary for DHCP
(the help message should mention this, most people won't
equate tcpdump with dhcpcd).
Anyway, after the ethernet wasn't initialized, I did an
ifconfig on the machine by hand...
I noticed I couldn't ping in to the box when I tried it.
Then I pinged out on the box.
Then everything worked fine...
Is this expected?  (I using Linksys ISA Ne2000 cards).
