Certainly I have no objections, I'm glad it was useful.

You don't keep this promise - bet you thought we wouldn't notice...
Actually I guess you do, in the "creating simple kobjects" section.
When you get to that point, you should mention that this is a situation
where standalone kobjects make sense.
Given that there are quite a few standalone kobjects created by this
patch set (kernel_kobj, security_kobj, s390_kobj, etc.), the "(even
unknown)" should probably come out.

Is setting the name mandatory now, or are there still places where
kobjects (which do not appear in sysfs) do have - and do not need - a
name?

So just how should severely should we mock kobject maintainers who can't
spell "mercilessly"?  :)

Can we try that one again?
 - A kset can provide a set of default attributes for all kobjects which
   belong to it.

Presumably the latter way is not recommended; I would either say so or
not mention this possibility at all.
