Hi,
In the latest 2.2.20-pre, the dmfe driver (davicom ethernet cards) is
only at version 1.28.
On my system, this version has a severe bug triggered by heavy file
transfers (the card hangs till dmfe.o is removed then loaded again).  On
Davicom's website, there's Sten Wang's driver 1.36 that corrects it (at
least for me :).

I've just "codingstyle"'d it, fixed a few typos and removed the
compatibility #define's.
