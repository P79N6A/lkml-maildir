Subject: [RFC][PATCH 1/3] PM: Introduce new top level suspend and hibernation callbacks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/16/130

From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl>
Introduce 'struct pm_ops' representing a set of suspend and
hibernation operations for bus types, device classes and device
types.
Modify the PM core to use 'struct pm_ops' objects, if defined, instead
of the ->suspend(), ->resume(), ->suspend_late(), ->resume_early()
callbacks that will be considered as legacy and gradually phased out.

  *
+ * The externally visible transitions are handled with the help of the following
+ * callbacks included in this structure:
+ *
+ * @prepare: Prepare the device for the upcoming transition, but do NOT change
+ *	its hardware state.  Prevent new children of the device from being
+ *	registered and prevent new calls to the probe method from being made
+ *	after @prepare() returns.  Also, if a concurrent child registration
+ *	or a call to the probe method already in progress is detected by
+ *	@prepare(), it may return -EAGAIN, so that the PM core can execute it
+ *	once again (e.g. after suspending the newly registered child) to recover
+ *	from the race condition. This method is executed for all kinds of
+ *	suspend transitions and is immediately followed by one of the suspend
+ *	callbacks: @suspend(), @freeze(), @poweroff(), or @quiesce().
+ *
+ * @complete: Undo the changes made by @prepare().  This method is executed for
+ *	all kinds of resume transitions, immediately following one of the resume
+ *	callbacks: @resume(), @thaw(), @restore(), or @recover().  Also executed
+ *	if a suspend callback (@suspend(), @freeze(), @poweroff(), @quiesce())
+ *	immediately following a successful @prepare() fails OR if a new child
+ *	of the device has been registered during @prepare().
+ *
+ * @suspend: Executed before putting the system into a sleep state in which the
+ *	contents of main memory are preserved.  Quiesce the device, put it into
+ *	a low power state appropriate for the upcoming system state (such as
+ *	PCI_D3hot), and enable wakeup events as appropriate.
+ *
+ * @resume: Executed after waking the system up from a sleep state in which the
+ *	contents of main memory were preserved.  Put the device into the
+ *	appropriate state, according to the information saved in memory by the
+ *	preceding @suspend().  The driver starts working again, responding to
+ *	hardware events and software requests.  The hardware may have gone
+ *	through a power-off reset, or it may have maintained state from the
+ *	previous suspend() which the driver may rely on while resuming.  On most
+ *	platforms, there are no restrictions on availability of resources like
+ *	clocks during @resume().
+ *
+ * @freeze: Hibernation-specific, executed before creating a hibernation image.
+ *	Quiesce operations so that a consistent image can be created, but do NOT
+ *	otherwise put the device into a low power device state and do NOT emit
+ *	system wakeup events.  Save in main memory the device settings to be
+ *	used by @restore() during the subsequent resume from hibernation.
+ *
+ * @thaw: Hibernation-specific, executed after creating a hibernation image.
+ *	Undo the changes made by the preceding @freeze(), so the device can be
+ *	operated in the same way as immediately before the call to @freeze().
+ *
+ * @poweroff: Hibernation-specific, executed after saving a hibernation image.
+ *	Quiesce the device, put it into a low power state appropriate for the
+ *	upcoming system state (such as PCI_D3hot), and enable wakeup events as
+ *	appropriate.
+ *
+ * @quiesce: Hibernation-specific, executed after loading a hibernation image
+ *	and before restoring the contents of main memory from it.  Quiesce
+ *	operations so that the contents of main memory can be restored from the
+ *	image in a consistent way, but do NOT otherwise put the device into a
+ *	low power state and do NOT emit system wakeup events.  Do NOT save any
+ *	device settings in main memory.
+ *
+ * @restore: Hibernation-specific, executed after restoring the contents of main
+ *	memory from a hibernation image.  Driver starts working again,
+ *	responding to hardware events and software requests.  Do NOT make ANY
+ *	assumptions about the hardware state right prior to @restore().  On most
+ *	platforms, there are no restrictions on availability of resources like
+ *	clocks during @restore().
+ *
+ * @recover: Hibernation-specific, executed after a failing creation of a
+ *	hibernation image OR after a failing attempt to restore the contents of
+ *	main memory from such an image.  Undo the changes made by the preceding
+ *	@freeze() or @quiesce(), so the device can be operated in the same way
+ *	as immediately before the failing transition.
+ *
+ * struct pm_ops is also used for defining driver PM operations to be carried
+ * out with interrupts disabled.  In this case, however, there is only one
+ * active CPU while the operations are being performed, so they are executed by
+ * the PM core in a more straightforward way.  In particular, the failure of
+ * @prepare() carried out with interrupts disabled causes the entire PM
+ * transition to fail, regardless of the error code returned by it.
+ *
+ * All of the above callbacks, except for @complete(), return error codes.
+ * However, the error codes returned by resume operations, @resume(), @thaw(),
+ * @restore(), and @recover(), are only printed in the system logs, since the
+ * PM core cannot do anything else about them.
