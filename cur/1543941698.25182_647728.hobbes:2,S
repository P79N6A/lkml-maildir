Applied, thanks.
I found myself having to grep through include/linux to figure out what
this _AC macro was really all about, so I added this to the description:
    PAGE_SIZE is used both from assembly and C code. We want to have type
    specifiers when using it from C, but this will make the assembler
    confused, so we need to make it conditional.
    This is exactly what the _AC macro is for, so using it allows us to
    get rid of a few lines of cpp noise.
My first thought was "Autoconf", and it sent shivers down my spine ;-)
