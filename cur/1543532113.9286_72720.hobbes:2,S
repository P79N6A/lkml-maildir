There is no penalty.  What is being reserved is available swap space,
not ram.  You will have the same system operational characteristics as
at present.  It's just that on a machine with up to 256 processes
available, you will have to provide 2GB of swap (which will never be
used in normal practice).
As to which processes are secure, that's up to you to decide. You are
being given the choice under this scheme, with guaranteed no OOM
for your secure processes, and no behavioural penalty. Just 2GB of
total backing swap required, just in case, and only to be able to give
you the guarantee you asked for.

It's possible to provide a similar scheme in which Virt = Ram + Swap1,
Swap = Swap1 + Swap2, and one maintains sufficient reserve in Swap2.
I didn't put it up here, largely because I wasn't confident of
getting it right first time in front of an audience.

It can't, or shouldn't.  But I'll give you it as a hypothetical
possibility.  Note that a 60MB stack is very unusual and only root can
do it.  So it's root's shoot yourself in the foot idea, and all
disclaimers apply.

OK.

OK.

OK.

Well, yes it has to page out 56MB of A's pages. But that's fine.
It has to do that anyway, and it is paging in (notionally) 60MB
of B's pages.

Yes.

??. No it has to page out 4MB of A's pages and page in 4MB of B's, etc
etc. etc., until finished.
> OOS. You should check free *swap* space, not free VM.
Why? I don't follow. Is this a performance issue? You had to page out
A and page in B, and vice versa. It was unavoidable. The limit imposed
by the accounting I proposed only prevents you launching MORE processes
now (process C, for example). It doesn't at all affect the behaviour of the
two processes A and B that you are considering.

This is a distinct approach. As I said, I wasn't confident of getting
the accounting rationale correct in public, so I put up a simpler rule,
which also clearly works, and whose only effect is to tell the system
when it can launch a process "securely". It doesn't affect the
processes behaviour if they are launched.
