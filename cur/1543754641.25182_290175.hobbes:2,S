That would be a MAP_FIXED call, so not affected by this change.

All MAP_FIXED, too.

Obviously having malloc() return NULL for a successful allocation would
be a bad thing, no?  That's precisely what could happen if an anonymous
allocation got mapped at 0x0.

Any particular thoughts as to how large a window should be reserved?
SHLIB_BASE is a bit more than 1MB, which is fairly small in the grand
scheme of things, but I guess I don't see why you'd reserve more than
PAGE_SIZE (or maybe PAGE_SIZE*2, though I can't actually articulate why
that seems like a good idea).
FWIW, mmap(2) also will return NULL if length==0.  That sure did confuse
me the first time I noticed.
