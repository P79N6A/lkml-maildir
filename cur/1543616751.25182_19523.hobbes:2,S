Subject: netlink sockets in 2.4.17

I am looking for what happened to the netlink sockets in the 2.4 series 
kernels (I'm screwing around with 2.4.17) As far as I can tell I need 
these to run Zebra (bgpd)
My query is this, when and why were netlink sockets removed from 2.4,
while netlink devices were left in there? and why was this not included
in a Changelog at any point?
Thanks for your time,
Jonathan Steinert
