This actual example helped to focus my mind a lot, thank you.

Yup, it ought to decide at the beginning of free_pgd_range
that it simply has no work to do.

And now we've gone wrong, yes.

At first that just looked like a hack to me.  But on reflection,
no, you're doing exactly what I had to do with addr above: in the
case where we arrive at 0 from non-0 value, have to get out quick
to avoid confusion with the "other" 0.  These wrap issues are hard.
And in other mail I see you found more such checks were needed.
I believe you've got it, thank you so much!
Though frankly, by now, I'm sure of nothing:
will review in the morning.

Well, it's trying to decide in reasonably few steps that it's not
worth wasting time going down to the deeper levels.  Lots of
"return"s as it eliminates cases, yes.
