mmm - that seems a reasonable trade-off.

We do have a way of guaranteeing no 'holes' get created unless the process
is interrupted for a *very* long time or killed (which could happen) during
the logging of an event.  The code is a little more complicated and does
require an atomic operation that may be more or less equivalent to the cli
cost.  In K42, and other OSes I worked on, we wanted very efficient logging
from user space as well.  I think there might be a place for understanding
libc, database, jvm, performance, for examples, but if we really only do
log events in kernel space then the cli/sti approach is simpler and roughly 
equivalent performance.

Yes! and we also have a scheme to allowed such a packed buffer stream to be
randomaly accessed on disk (useful if you have 100Ms or Gs of data).
