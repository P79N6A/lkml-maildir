fantasio:~/tmp/linux-2.6.20$ fgrep CONFIG_LBD .config
# CONFIG_LBD is not set

Yes I said that. At least I did not notice it happen:) 
Reproduction seems easy. So I will try. 
I have some problem: I am not sufficiently familar with git!
I found 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/howto/isolate-bugs-with-bisect.txt
Is this the way to do a git-bisect?
From where do I get the 'labels' for good(2.6.17) and bad(2.6.20)?
regards
