not sure, I'm not the one dealing with the testing, but most relevant
data is public on the official websites. the limit reached is around 5k
users with 8cpus 32G and I don't recall that limit to be zone-normal
bound.  With 2.6 and bio and remap_file_pages we may reduce the
zone-normal usage as well (after dropping rmap).
But I definitely agree going past that with 3:1 is not feasible.
Overall we may argue about the 32G (especially a 32-way would be more
problematic due the 4 times higher per-cpu memory reservation in
zone-normal, I mean 48M of zone-normal are just wasted in the page
allocator per-cpu logic, without counting the other per-cpu stuff, all
would be easily fixable by limiting the per-cpu sizes, though for 2.4 it
probably doesn't worth it), but I'm quite confortable to say that up to
16G (included) 4:4 is worthless unless you've to deal with the rmap
waste IMHO. And <= 16G probably counts for 99% of machines out there
which are handled optimally by 3:1.
