Sorry, I was unclear.  I want to know the dependency semantics:
If B exports S, should depmod believe A needs B, or not?  Your patch
leaves that semantic (all it does is suppress the errors).
I'm not sure what semantics are "right", since I don't know what
you're trying to do, or what is wrong with get_symbol().
Hope that clarifies?
Rusty.
