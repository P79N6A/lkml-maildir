Running slackware with kernel 2.2.13pre15 and I am getting the following:
 NET: 1 messages suppressed.
And I am also seeing this:
Oct  5 15:51:31 ve1drg modprobe: can't locate module char-major-6
Not sure they are related in any way. But was wondering about why that
'NET: 1 messages suppressed' error/message.
