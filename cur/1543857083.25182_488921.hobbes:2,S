At first glance, this looks reasonable.
It also looks like it should be used to replace a lot of the
cancel_delayed_work() calls that attempt to cancel _undelayed_ work items.
That would allow a number of work items to be downgraded from delayed_work to
work_struct.
Also, the name "run_scheduled_work" sort of suggests that the work *will* be
run regardless of whether it was pending or not.  Given the confusion over
cancel_delayed_work(), I imagine this will rain confusion too.

I wonder if those can be combined, perhaps:
+	if ((work->management & ~WORK_STRUCT_NOAUTOREL) ==
+	    ((unsigned long) cwq | (1 << WORK_STRUCT_PENDING))
Otherwise for i386 the compiler can't combine them because test_bit() is done
with inline asm.
And:
+		if (!test_bit(WORK_STRUCT_PENDING, &work->management))
Should possibly be:
+		if (!work_pending(work))
