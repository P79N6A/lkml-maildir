Subject: [PATCH] move the related code from exit_notify() to exit_signals()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/6/170

The previous bugfix was not optimal, we shouldn't care about group stop when
we are the only thread or the group stop is in progress. In that case nothing
special is needed, just set PF_EXITING and return.
Also, take the related "TIF_SIGPENDING re-targeting" code from exit_notify().
So, from the performance POV the only difference is that we don't trust
!signal_pending() until we take ->siglock. But this in fact fixes another
___pure___ theoretical minor race. __group_complete_signal() finds the task
without PF_EXITING and chooses it as the target for signal_wake_up(). But
nothing prevents this task from exiting in between without noticing the
pending signal and thus unpredictably delaying the actual delivery.
