Unfortunately I couldn't get it to work when I tried last
time and now I've too many machines running on the good ol'
double hit tftp scheme to make a switch quite cumbersome.
But you're right, I should definitely try it. I've two questions
regarding it though:
- Right now I've several machines having etherboot on flash, how
  can I use pxelinux (or similar) with them? I don't want to have
  two quite different ways to deal with.
- Are there any kind of constraints which annoy me right now
  with etherboot/mknbi like maximum kernel size < 1M?
