Maybe this could fix it in 2.6.20? (went into 2.6.21)

    Revert "e1000: fix NAPI performance on 4-port adapters"
    
    This reverts commit 60cba200f11b6f90f35634c5cd608773ae3721b7.  It's been
    linked to lockups of the e1000 hardware, see for example
    
    	
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=229603
    
    but it's likely that the commit itself is not really introducing the
    bug, but just allowing an unrelated problem to rear its ugly head (ie
    one current working theory is that the code exposes us to a hardware
    race condition by decreasing the amount of time we spend in each NAPI
    poll cycle).
    
    We'll revert it until root cause is known.  Intel has a repeatable
    reproduction on two different machines and bus traces of the hardware
    doing something bad.
