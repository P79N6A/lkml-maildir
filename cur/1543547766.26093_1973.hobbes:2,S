There is a nice discussion about the online-debugging vers. the
"doing it the hard way" approach in some software engineering books out
there.
(Sorry I don't have them here at hand, so I can't give an exact
refference - it was either
the famous "Mythical Man Month" or "Warum is Software so Teuer und
andere Mythen
der Informationstechnologie" by some other guy whose name I don't
remember ;-).
However I'm quite sure someone here will remember it well...
Basically in the book I have in mind the author was describing the
result's of a spinoff
company from IBM which was trying to make some money on the added
facility of
"heart surgery" to some early IBM OS. (IBM did release them just for the
price of a symbolic 1$)/ Basically after some time they have
realized that yes casual debugging was easier and more productive, but
after long the
statistical view showed that the code quality was rather degrading by 
using on the fly debuggers instead of improving. --- Sometimes the
obvious isn't
the RIGHT THING becouse most of the time the easy fixes are just band
aids
hiding the trough problems. Therefore I would rather like to back-up the
position of Ingo.
And finally I would like to emphasize that every singe additional
facility doesn't
come free - It's adding complexity which is a source of possible
problems in itself.
