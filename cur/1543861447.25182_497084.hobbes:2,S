(and you know what charset the file is thought to have with all 1000
lines in it.)
All on a system with LANG set to en_GB (iow ISO-8859-1).

The same thing actually happens when I look at it via:
  $ git log | head -n 1000 | less
but in this case the output is always interpreted by the terminal to be
in its character set.

I'm not - I'm running a pure ISO-8859-1 system:
$ echo $LANG
en_GB
$ locale -k LC_CTYPE | grep charmap
charmap="ISO-8859-1"

$ LANG=en_GB.UTF-8 file -i o
o: text/x-c; charset=iso-8859-1
$ git version
git version 1.4.4.2
Looks like the output is iso-8859-1 even with UTF-8!

Git may store its text internally in UTF-8 (I don't know but I have no
evidence to suggest it does - in fact I have some evidence in this test
that it doesn't care about charsets.)  git log output on a non-UTF-8
system certainly is not in the hosts character set.  For example:
$ LANG=en_GB.UTF-8 git log | head -n 1000 > o
$ LANG=en_GB git log | head -n 1000 > o2
$ diff -u o o2
That includes the UTF-8 encoded part of Leonard name.  It also includes
Rafa? Bilski's name which is non-UTF-8 encoded.
So, in both cases, exactly the same output bytestream was created
independent of the character set _actually_ being used, which both
includes untranslated UTF-8 and non-UTF-8 sequences.
There is obviously no character set translation going on with the output.
So we can add 'git' to my list of charset-broken programs.
Also, since we have recent data in the git repository which is non-UTF-8
as well, it is clear that there is no character set translation going on
at input time either.
Looking at the git-commit script, there appears to be no character set
conversion going on in there either.
So, I think you'll find that the contents of git _is_ an ad-hoc collection
of character sets which people happen to have in use on their machines.

I'm not talking about a mixed charset environment.  I'm talking about
non-UTF-8 single charset environments being broken by programs which
universally think the universe is UTF-8 only.
