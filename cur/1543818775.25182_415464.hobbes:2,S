Ok, I see the problem. It happened because the zone boundary between DMA 
and NORMAL was in a hole.
When I am working out the size of a hole, I check the zone for the end_pfn 
of one active range is the same zone as the start_pfn in the next range. 
In this case, the end of area 1 is 131020 in DMA and the start of area 2 
is 393216 in NORMAL so the hole does not get accounted for.
