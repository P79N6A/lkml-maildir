pfn_to_nid() on most x86_64 machines access one cache line (struct memnode).
Node 0 MemBase 0000000000000000 Limit 0000000280000000
Node 1 MemBase 0000000280000000 Limit 0000000480000000
NUMA: Using 31 for the hash shift.
On this example, we use only 8 bytes of memnode.embedded_map[] to find nid of 
all 16 GB of ram. On profiles I have, memnode is always hot (no cache miss on it).
While virt_to_slab() has to access :
1) struct page -> page_get_slab() (page->lru.prev) (one cache miss)
2) struct slab -> nodeid (one other cache miss)
So using pfn_to_nid() would avoid 2 cache misses.
I understand we want to do special things (fallback and such tricks) at 
allocation time, but I believe that we can just trust the real nid of memory 
at free time.
