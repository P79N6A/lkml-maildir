Yess!!
Something like that had to be done eventually about the inefficient
current_thread_info() mechanism, but I wasn't sure what exactly.

This is interesting, since even by doing a non-elegant
current->... --> struct task_struct *tsk = current;
replacement for excessive uses of current, I was able to gain almost 10kB
within a single file already!
I guess it's due to having tried that on an older installation with gcc 3.2,
which probably does less efficient opcode merging of current_thread_info()
requests compared to a current gcc version.
IOW, .text segment reduction could be quite a bit higher for older gcc:s.

Not a problem for more daring user-space apps (i.e. Wine), I hope?
