Sounds reasonable.  What I care about is that we have the goals straight at least.

It sounds like we may have been getting lucky on that one.  I guess an explicit
align directive fixes that.

Interesting, so reading this and skimming your patch the voyager BIOS is a
descendant of the XT & AT BIOS.  But it is a very weird one.
What was the gate a20 issue, you fixed in setup.S?

That could be it.  But there have been enough systems with that
problem I would have thought the various bootloaders would have
already handled it.  syslinux especially.

Certainly a different one.  I find it interesting how none of these
maps reserve the bios interrupt table, or the BIOS data area.  Basically
the first 1280 bytes of memory...  And they just assume everyone will
know better and not touch them :)
