    Once the ULI code has taken over a CPU, it should not be rescheduable
until the ULI completes.  The goal is a very fast jump in and out of user
space.  Primitives are provided for the waking of another thread / process
if the applications needs to do a lot of work.
    If I've left open the possibility of a reschedule, then it was a design
error.  As I think about it though everything should still work fine, but
it's purely by accident. :)
    If you have test code for hotplug I'd be happy to test it for you.
