Ah and more bad there was also a bug in my patch ;)...
I tried to find a case in the current code that would race with the
trivial fix applyed, but I can' t, but _only_ because _now_ it' s
completly illegal to do an enable_irq() if there' s not been a
disable_irq() a bit before.  Otherwise do_ioapic_edge_IRQ()  would race
easily with the old code since the enable_irq() would allow two irq
handlers to run at the same time since it would cleanup the IRQ_INPROGRESS
flag in the irq_desc struct allowing a new shared irq handler to run at
the same time. 
The reason I fixed the bug (and in pre-2.1.132-4 there' s really a bug) in
my way is because I consider it the right one. I was aware that clearing
out IRQ_INPROGRESS in enable_irq() was fixing the thing, it' s the first
thing I done some seconds I noticed that the ethernet card was not getting
irqs anymore.
I think my fix is more correct and make more sense to me, because I think
it's the natural way to handle IRQ_INPROGRESS. When there's an irq running
IRQ_INPROGRESS it' s set and when there aren' t it's clear. And it's
set/unset from the irqhandler itself. I see this way more clean. So far
the updated patch runs fine here. 
I repost the fixed patch in the case you'll eventually agree with my
arguments.
