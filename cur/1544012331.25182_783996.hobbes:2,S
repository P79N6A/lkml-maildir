Subject: [PATCH 22/35] ocfs2: Don't hand-code xor in ocfs2_hamming_encode().
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Joel Becker <joel.becker@oracle.com>
When I wrote ocfs2_hamming_encode(), I was following documentation of
the algorithm and didn't have quite the (possibly still imperfect) grasp
of it I do now.  As part of this, I literally hand-coded xor.  I would
test a bit, and then add that bit via xor to the parity word.
I can, of course, just do a single xor of the parity word and the source
word (the code buffer bit offset).  This cuts CPU usage by 53% on a
mostly populated buffer (an inode containing utmp.h inline).
