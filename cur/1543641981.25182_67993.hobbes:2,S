Skb may have some pages in its skb_shared_info as frags, but each
page may not have extra space in it while csum_partial() is used
to compute checksum against each page.
We can see skb_checksum() calls csum_partial() againt each page in skb.
No one knows whether the next page exits or not as it may be mapped
in kmap space.
Hmmm...
Only the implematation for x86 may have the problem that csum_partial()
may access beyond end of the page.
