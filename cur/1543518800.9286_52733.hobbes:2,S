That's basically what happens here - people report that their connection
seems to be broken, or just that they cannot load, e.g., one WWW page in one
run - two or three reloads are needed. Also, getting ANYTHING long with POP3
or IMAP also tends to break. Personally, I think that not only SACK is to be
blamed for those problems, but also the window scaling option - when I
turned BOTH of them off, the problems disappeared. When only SACK was off,
the problems were much less frequent, but nevertheless still existent.
