Well, the thing is, I suspect we have created way more bugs by having that 
stupid "you must check the return value even if you don't care", than by 
just letting it go.

If the only valid reason to fail is a kernel bug, it damn well should be 
that sysfs function itself that should complain. It's the only thing that 
knows and cares.

Here's a question: do you always check the return value of "printf()"?
Nobody does. It's not worth it. Trying to do so just creates messy code, 
and MORE BUGS.
So yes, I think we should ignore return values when they have absolutely 
zero interest level to us.
