Take FPU state: memory copies and RAID xor functions use MMX/SSE and 
require that the full task state be saved and restored.
Task priority is another.  POSIX AIO lets you specify request priority, and 
it really is needed for realtime workloads where things like keepalive 
must be processed at a higher priority.  This is especially important on 
embedded systems which don't have a surplus of CPU cycles.
