I don't think you've interpreted what I've said correctly.  I'm not
arguing at all about SERIO itself.  In fact, I completely agree that
selecting KEYBOARD_ATKBD should automatically select SERIO since
atkbd.c uses serio.c.
The information I received today from James Bottomley, who is also
seeing this issue, is that the following construct resulted in
I8042 being unconditionally selected:
config KEYBOARD_ATKBD
	...
	select SERIO
	select SERIO_I8042 if X86
However, I've just decided to try it myself, and it does indeed work
as expected.  Here's a (tested on non-x86) patch which fixes this issue
and gives us the correct behaviour for non-x86 platforms, and should
also give the desired behaviour for x86 and embedded platforms.
