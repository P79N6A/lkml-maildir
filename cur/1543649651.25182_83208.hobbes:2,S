I'm not allowing you to put a hack special ARP header type into
the kernel when the real fix is to clean up the 802.11 handling
in the entire tree.
If that means every ethernet driver has to be aware of variable length
headers potentially, so be it.
This is the second time I'm saying this.
I'm not going to address the compression bits until you resolve this
and fix the problem properly instead of proposing hacks.
