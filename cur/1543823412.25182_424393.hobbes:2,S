You noted the comment, didn't you. This really should use user_mode(), but it can't as the unwind annotations don't
cover selector registers. Hence the initial CS/SS will always remain in place no matter how many unwinds you do.
But it's harmless for this function to return 'kernel mode' when in fact it might be user mode - nothing would crash
because of that, it might only lead to ill trailing entries on a stack dump.
