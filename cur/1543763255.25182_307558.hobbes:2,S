    The fact is that, in the past, I've used kernel headers older
than my running kernel for building glibc and my system worked
seamlessly (although I don't use bleeding edge features, you know),
but I don't want to take risks.
    I don't know which set of headers will work, and in fact I don't
know if I must follow 'Linux From Scratch' advice and use raw kernel
headers for building glibc and LLH headers for any other thing. I
think I probably will use the LLH headers (including scsi) for
everything since glibc passes the 'make check' doing that... If I
screw my system badly, I have lotsa backups at hand.
    Thanks for your advice :)
