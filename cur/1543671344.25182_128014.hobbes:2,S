Considering that your process space is 4gig, and that that 128Mb doesn't 
really exist anywhere (no RAM, no page table entries, nothing), it's 
really not excessive.  If you're so strapped for process space that you 
need that extra 128Mb, then you probably shouldn't be using a 32-bit 
processor.
I understand that the stack exists somewhere high up in the address 
space.  And there's some other things up there (mmap space, etc).  What 
happens if the heap grows so much that it collides with one of those 
upper address spaces?  Out of memory?
