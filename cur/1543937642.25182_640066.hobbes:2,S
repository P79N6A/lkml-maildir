Subject: [PATCH] x86: make clflush a required feature on x86_64
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/17/597

Hopefully nobody will be stupid enough to implement a cpu without
it. Frankly, it seems safe enough given we already require SSE2.
This means the compiler can optimise away "if (!cpu_has_clflush)"
blocks.
