this may be obvious... apologies.
don't use the TOD directly -- it can go backwards if ntpd or an admin
sets it back.  better to use a monotonically increasing number that
you completely control yourself.
also, if your timer resolution isn't good enough, a window opens 
where two generated "uniquifiers" can be the same for all intents
and purposes.
if there's nothing else we've learned from NFS, it's that using
timestamps is a lousy way of managing cache coherency and file
identity.  ;-)
