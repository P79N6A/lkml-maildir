Well, it is. But it'll cause it to enable something that has been broken for a while.
FWIW, I think having the stack protector reenabled in -stable is a worthwhile goal,
but only once it's stabilised for a while in the development tree.
My fear by just reenabling this for -stable is that when distros push out updates
based on the latest -stable, we'll see more systems like James' problematic system.
