It isnt compensating for that. If you have 4Gig of memory and a high performance
I/O controller the constant cost per page for VM management begins to dominate
the equation. Its also a win for other CPU related reasons (reduced tlb
misses and the like), and with 4Gig of RAM the argument is a larger page
size isnt a problem.
