Last time this came up, I asked you to enable debugging in the driver to
see the data flow through it and find out if it really is the driver at
fault here.
Did you do this?  Did anything happen that was "odd"?
Can you do a 'git bisect' of Linus's tree to try to track down the
issue?

That's always been the case, ever since the 2.2 kernel releases.  Please
use udev if you want persistent device names for your tty USB devices.
