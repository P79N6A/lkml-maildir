Andrew,
Here are the mmap read-around related patches initiated by Linus.
They are for linux-2.6.24-rc4-mm1.  The one major new feature -
auto detection and early readahead for mmap sequential reads - runs
as expected on my desktop :-)
[PATCH 1/9] readahead: simplify readahead call scheme
[PATCH 2/9] readahead: clean up and simplify the code for filemap page fault readahead
[PATCH 3/9] readahead: auto detection of sequential mmap reads
[PATCH 4/9] readahead: quick startup on sequential mmap readahead
[PATCH 5/9] readahead: make ra_submit() non-static
[PATCH 6/9] readahead: save mmap read-around states in file_ra_state
[PATCH 7/9] readahead: remove unused do_page_cache_readahead()
[PATCH 8/9] readahead: move max_sane_readahead() calls into force_page_cache_readahead()
[PATCH 9/9] readahead: call max_sane_readahead() in ondemand_readahead()
Thank you,
Fengguang
