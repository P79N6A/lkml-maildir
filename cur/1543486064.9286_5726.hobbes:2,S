Yes. The install does `mv library library.sav` ; `cp new_library library`.
So, In principle, this should work. However it doesn't, apparently
because one can only perform one operation at a time so at some instant,
there is a new ld-linux.so and an old libc.n.n.so. And `mv`, `install`,
'cp`, etc. all use these libraries. This would not happen if the library
version numbers were different because 'mv'. etc., would always use
the library.n.n.so it was linked against.
