It may be completely unrelated, but we had similar problems in one
server after installing a new gigabit ethernet card. The server ran fine
for several days, and then the disk became unreachable. After a reboot
all was fine for a few days, and then the problem showed up again.
We 'solved' the problem by moving the ethernet card to a different pci
slot where it didn't share it's interrupt with the ide controler.
The mainboard was an asus a7v-133, and the NIC uses the tg3 driver.
