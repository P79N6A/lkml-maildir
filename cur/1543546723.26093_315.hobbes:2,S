I think, as you have already observed, is the implicit behavior.

I don't know. I think there may be some confusion about how Linux/Unix
operates.
In VAX/VMS, you have the problem Chris cited because every interrupt
causes a context-switch. The task that was interrupted is simply put
into the queue of runnable tasks. Also, any time some task makes a
system-call, it also loses out because it is also put into the queue
and won't get the CPU again until the kernel has completed whatever
function the user requested.
This was a nice scheduling idea for slow I/O bound processes like
in the old VAXen days.  This was before RAM cache, prefetch buffers,
etc. Also, you didn't have two or more CPUs ready to pounce at any
instant.
Unix, and Unix variants perform kernel functions on behalf of, and
in the context of, the caller. You don't lose the CPU just because
you called getpid(). However, when the kernel can't do something
right away (it's I/O bound), you sleep and somebody else gets the
CPU. Things done in the kernel are done with kernel privs, but
they are done in the context of a caller.
Interrupts just save the caller's registers, load kernel registers,
execute an ISR with kernel privs, reload caller's registers, then
return to the interrupted task.
