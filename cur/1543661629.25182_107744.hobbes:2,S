  Summary: Wildcards in RTC alarm settings failed to work
  
  Description:
   The RTC has provision for wildcards when setting the alarm; to
   use them you have to write a value higher than 0xc0 to the
   appropriate hr/min/sec entry.  The driver used 0xff, which is
   fine, but it mistakenly fed the 0xff through BIN_TO_BCD before
   writing them (which is < 0xc0) and so wildcards didn't work.
   (Thanks to Gerhard Kurz for reporting the bug.)
