+How to deal with bad memory e.g. reported by memtest86+ ?
+#########################################################
+
+There are three possibilities I know of:
+
+1) Reinsert/swap the memory modules
+
+2) Buy new modules (best!) or try to exchange the memory
+   if you have spare-parts
+
+3) Use BadRAM or memmap
+
+This Howto is about number 3) .
+
+
+BadRAM
+######
+BadRAM is the actively developed and available as kernel-patch
+here:  
http://rick.vanrein.org/linux/badram/
+
+It takes the patterns of memtest86+ as arguments to exclude the defective
+areas of the memory.
+
+Example: memtest86+ reported here errors at address 0x18691458, 0x18698424 and
+         some others. All had 0x1869xxxx in common, so I chose a pattern of
+         0x18690000,0xffff0000.
+         This means exclusion of the area from 0x18690000 to 0x1869ffff
+         (which is a block of 64k).
+         My kernel-cmdline was:  badram=0x18690000,0xffff0000
+
+There are efforts to bring BadRAM into mainline in some way, possibly using
+memmap internally (maybe 2.6.26 ?).
+Thread on lkml: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/2/42
+
+For more details see the BadRAM documentation.
+
+
+memmap
+######
+memmap is already in the kernel and usable as kernel-parameter at boot-time.
+Its syntax is different and you may need to calculate the values by yourself!
+
+Syntax to exclude a memory area (see kernel-parameters.txt for details):
+memmap=<size>$<address>
+
+With the numbers of the example above:
+memmap=64K$0x18690000
+ or
+memmap=0x10000$0x18690000
+
+TODO: Multiple areas to exclude using memmap ?
+
Add example of usage to memmap - evolved from thread about BadRAM inclusion.
