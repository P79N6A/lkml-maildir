Hello,
at least two teams work upon it here in Germany
references:
http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/index.xml.de
http://i30www.ira.uka.de
A branch of stable kernels upon L4/Fiasco is maintained at TU Dresden
and available at:
http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/L4/LinuxOnL4/.
 
Though Mr. Torvalds seems not to be amused about micro kernel aproach,
this work is not done in vein due to the inherent technical superiority
in certain applications mostly regarding distributed systems including
NUMA architectures.
best, Hans Adams
