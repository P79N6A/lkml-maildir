I don't think that's necessary as I believe the desktops handle the
mount/unmount using eject (at least Gnome does on my Ubuntu system).
After using Ben's fix (suggested by Jens I believe) for the eject

modifications (ends up the ALLOW_DEVICE_REMOVAL is already on the
safe_for_write list, just under a different name).
