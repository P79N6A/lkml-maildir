- Add sys_new_call to the syscall table
- Create a stub thunk:
asmlinkage long sys_old_call(long parm1, long parm2, long parm3)
{
	return sys_new_call(parm1, parm2, parm3, 0);
}
We have 2^n examples on this in the kernel already.
Or, if the new syscall requires more than 6 parameters (with the current 
convention):
asmlinkage long sys_new_call6(long parm1, long parm2, long parm3,
			      long parm4, long parm5,
			      long __user *additional)
{
	long xparm[3];	/* 8 parameters, total */
	if (copy_from_user(xparm, additional, sizeof xparm)
	    != sizeof xparm)
		return -EFAULT;
	return sys_new_call(parm1, parm2, parm3, parm4, parm5,
			    xparm[0], xparm[1], xparm[2]);
}
This is a fixed-size copy from userspace, which obviously cannot be avoided.
The C version isn't optimal, obviously, hence my mentioning the 
possibility of doing it in the arch layer.
