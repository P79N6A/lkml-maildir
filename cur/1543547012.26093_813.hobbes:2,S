This almost seems like a troll.  We who write GPLed software don't claim
ownership of other's work--we just specify the conditions under which the
others can use *our* work.  What's wrong with that?  Are you saying we should
just give our work away to you with compensation at all?  You Communist!  ;-)
Regarding Microsoft, I suppose that's true.  Microsoft is about taking control
away from users and giving it to vendors, and the GPL is, to a degree, the
reverse.  The smart user will gravitate towards GPLed software, and in a fair
and competitive marketplace, the smart vendors will follow.
