This message means pretty much what it says: noise or something else 
caused the connection to be disabled.  In theory this could be caused by a 
problem with the host controller, the cable, or the printer.  Does this 
happen consistently with 2.6.13-mm1?  Did it happen with 2.6.12?

If it's not already in 2.6.13-mm1, this patch may help with the 
reinitialization:
