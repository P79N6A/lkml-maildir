        Linux-2.5.19 with acpi runs fine on every machine that I
have tried it on, as does Linux-2.5.21 without acpi.  However,
Linux-2.5.21 with acpi hangs at boot time before the kernel
prints any output on one of these computers, and reboots at boot
time before printing any output that I could see on another.
I suspect that something is wrong with the way the kernel gets
                                        2.5.19  2.5.21  2.5.21
                                        + ACPI  + ACPI  no ACPI
VIA VT82C691 [Apollo PRO] (rev c4)	ok	ok	ok
VIA VT82C691 [Apollo PRO] (rev 44)	ok	hangs	ok
Intel 440GX - 82443GX Host bridge	ok	reboots	ok
	There were substantial acpi changes in 2.5.20, and
almost acpi changes in 2.5.21.
	Anyhow, I hope this information is useful.
