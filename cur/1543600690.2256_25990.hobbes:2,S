I recall invalidate_device for that reason before starting the update
(this is indipendent from the blkdev-pagecache patch though, the problem
with the higher level caches applies to mainline as well at the last
blkdev close).
That's meant to give a better chance to the ro-mounted fs to notice the
modifications done by userspace. Probably invalidate_device should also
recall shrink_dcache_sb before running invalidate_inodes though...
