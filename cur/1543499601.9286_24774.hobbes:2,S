The OOM patch seems very logical.
Previous OOM posts from ages ago point for an additional need for custom exception and kill-first lists..
/etc/oom.ignore
   PROCESS=ncftpd
   PROCESS=ironlung_controller
   USER=root,rc.user
/etc/oom.kill1st
   PROCESS=/usr/cai/uni
   USER=sleepy,dopey,cottonball,peter
   AGE=<3600
PROCESS would be a process name to kill.
USER would be all users.
AGE would be the age in seconds of processes.
Now what do you do if you have a process matching both files ?
What if you want a specific process by a specific user...
Not sure.
