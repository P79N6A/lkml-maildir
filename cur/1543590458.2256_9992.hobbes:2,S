I was looking at the new patch, and I saw something that puzzles me.
Why do you set the EXT2_INDEX_FL on a new (empty) directory, rather
than only setting it when the dx_root index is created?
Setting the flag earlier than that makes it mostly useless, since it
will be set on basically every directory.  Not setting it would also
make your is_dx() check simply a check for the EXT2_INDEX_FL bit (no
need to also check size).
Also no need to set EXT2_COMPAT_DIR_INDEX until such a time that we have
a (real) directory with an index, to avoid gratuitous incompatibility
with e2fsck.
Cheers, Andreas
