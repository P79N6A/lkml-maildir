I'd be glad to make NUMA the default config. That allows us to completely 
get rid of zones. Just keep nodes around. Then we have a DMA node and a 
DMA32 node (working like a headless memory node) and a highmem node.
This would simplify the VM. But please do not have multiple nodes and 
multiple zones. If we do not like the term nodes then lets call them 
zones and get rid of the nodes.
