Reminds me of the Klingon programming language:
http://tinyurl.com/4rjco
7 : "Klingon function calls do not have 'parameters' -- they have
'arguments' -- and they ALWAYS WIN THEM."
8 : "What is this talk of 'release'? Klingons do not make software
'releases.' Our software 'escapes' leaving a bloody trail of designers and
quality assurance people in its wake."
9 : "Indentation?! - I will show you how to indent when I indent your
skull!"
