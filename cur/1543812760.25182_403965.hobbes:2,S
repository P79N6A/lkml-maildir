Yep, the gory details are at:
http://oss.oracle.com/~mfasheh/lock_distribution.csv
This measure was taken about 18,000 locks into a kernel untar. The only
change was that I switched things to only hash the last 18 characters of
lock resource names.
In short things aren't so bad that a larger hash table wouldn't help. We've
definitely got some peaks however. Our in-house laboratory of mathematicians
(read: Bill Irwin) is checking out methods by which we can smooth things out
a bit more :)
