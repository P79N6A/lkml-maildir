I go to great lengths to try and avoid that. People often get very
short replies but I try to make sure if the patch isnt queued to apply
they get a reply. Sometimes I have to sit on them for a week until I
understand why I don't like them.
The things I happily drop are people arguing about why I dropped their patch
