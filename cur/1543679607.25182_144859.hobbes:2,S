You'll note that loop.c goes from (page/offset/len) to (addr/len), and this
transfer function then immediately goes from (addr,len) to
(page/offset/len).
That's rather silly, and it forces the loop driver to play games pushing
pages into lowmem.
Can we keep everything using (page/offset/len) end-to-end?
