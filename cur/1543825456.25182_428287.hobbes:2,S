Simon, I suspect here you actually have unsynced ITCs, as the
check_monotonic_clock values are all locked w/ spinlocks.
You should probably add a cmpxchg in clocksource_itc_read() where you
currently do the if (last_itc < now), or you'll race on setting
last_itc. Let me know if you still see the issue w/ that fix.

It would be nice to do so sooner or later. There will probably be a few
regressions as the bits in -mm are more stripped down then the older
code in -rt, but I'd work to fill those holes as they appeared.
Thomas, did you have any thought about the hrt code I sent you?
 
thanks
