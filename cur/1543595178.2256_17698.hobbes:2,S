Hi,
Since I switched to the kernel nfsd I have troubles exporting my
filesystems. I think in kernel 2.2.x there was no problem, neither was
it with the userspace nfsd. Currently I run kernel 2.4.5pre1 on the
server.
1. When I try to boot one of my diskless clients (kernel 2.0.34), it mounts
its root fs from /opt/boot/client which is on an ext2 fs. But apparently
it hangs when it tries to access lib/ld-linux.so.1 (seen with a network
sniffer). This is a symbolic link pointing to lib/ld-linux.so.1.9.2.
In the kernel log I find:
nfsd Security: lib/ld-linux.so.1 bad export.
2. I cannot any longer mount the server's /usr on certain workstations.
It works on my main workstation which currently runs kernel 2.4.5.
On other workstations I get "permission denied by server". I tried various
kernels (2.0.36, 2.2.3, 2.3.52) and various versions of mount (2.7l, 2.10o).
My /etc/exports contains the line
/usr            *.hjb.de(rw,no_root_squash)
and all my clients are in my local DNS. The syslog shows
rpc.mountd: getfh failed: Operation not permitted
Any help? More info on request.
Thanks,
hjb
