What "security concern" are you talking about? Someone asked a
question about how copying to a file works, and I answered that. It
was separate to the discussion, though, and has nothing to do with
security.
Note that static binaries don't matter. They will just exhibit the
existing behaviour (delete). No security problem there.
There is simply no need for an undelete/move-to-garbage-area feature
in the kernel. It can all be done perfectly fine in userspace.
