Under what conditions were you seeing incorrect IRQ settings for the PAS
16?  I've never noticed a problem with the kernel detecting and using
the card with the correct settings, including the Soundblaster
emulation. Of course, the card was set up in its current configuration a
long time ago under DOS and I've never had an occasion to change it.
That may have something to do with it.
I'll have to try your patch though, since I had noticed the problem with
undloading modules when compiled and installed that way.  Since I mostly
compile and use the card monolithicaly, I haven't felt compelled to look
into the code closely.
