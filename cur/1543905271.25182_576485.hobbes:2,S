I regularly test native Linux games on CFS, and they all behave well. 
While waiting for more detailed data from Kasper i was looking for 
atypical stuff in Kasper's description about what his workload involves, 
and what looked a bit atypical was that Kasper's workload also involved 
gaming under Wine:

and Wine is a more complex server/client scenario instead of a single 
(and simple) standalone Quake3 binary that the Linux binary does. So it 
looked more interesting from a scheduler workload (and scheduler 
regression) POV. In any case i'll need more info from Kasper.
