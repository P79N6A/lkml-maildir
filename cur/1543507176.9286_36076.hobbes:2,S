From looking at some old code I wrote, what you need to change is the poll
hook, of file_operations. I had some working code who used both this
approach and a wait-on-read approach, and it works quite fine.
(You actually don't need read() and write() if you don't want them. And if
you want to get data from the device just use read() - you don't
need select(), unless you wish to enjoy the timeout option).
By the way, why are you calling this an 'async event'? This is very much a
synchronous event. A signal is an asynchronous one.
Unless I'm missing some terminology here.
