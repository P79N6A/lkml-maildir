At OLS Linus suggested it should distinguish between sync and async
events for locking reasons.
	if(dma_async_commit(foo) == SYNC_COMPLETE) {
		finalise_stuff();
	}
	else		/* will call foo->callback(foo->dev_id) */
because otherwise you have locking complexities - the callback wants to
take locks to guard the object it works on but if it is called
synchronously - eg if hardware is busy and we fall back - it might
deadlock with the caller of dmaa_async_foo() who also needs to hold the
lock.
