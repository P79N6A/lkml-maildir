This patch doesn't account for sigqueue bits properly.  The allocations
aren't always made in task context.  So, it's trivial to illegitimately
drain off the new signal_pending counter, leaving the potential for the
original DoS unfixed.  And the setuid issues still seem to be there,
right?
Couple other nits below:
Some bits need to be converted to tabs from spaces.

Missed this one.

Won't compile.

Besides right below, is this really used anymore?

and here, but max_queued_signals is no longer really relevant, right?
Should we removed both nr_queued_signals and max_queued_signals and the
associated sysctl's?  Or leave it, and give CAP_SYS_RESOURCE the ability
to do a full override?  I chose the latter, although I'm inclined to
drop that bit.

I have a diff between your patch and what I'm testing, but it's
cluttered a bit by the fact that I've also merged it up to 2.6.6-rc3
I can send you the full patch if that's easier.
thanks,
