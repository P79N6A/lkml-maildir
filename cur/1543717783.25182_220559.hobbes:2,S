Right.  At present you need to enable the second SATA  port in the
BIOS.  Disabling it also disables the first port from being
recognized by the driver.  It's a figment of the "compatability mode"
that the PE750 runs in.  I believe Stuart Hayes sent Jeff a patch to
address this, but I can't find it handy...
