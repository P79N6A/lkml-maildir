It's the unix semantics of readdir(); e.g. specified in Single Unix:
``   The type DIR, which is defined in the header <dirent.h>, represents
     a directory stream, which is an ordered sequence of all the
     directory entries in a particular directory. Directory entries
     represent files; files may be removed from a directory or added to
     a directory asynchronously to the operation of readdir(). ''
An ordered sequence does not include cycles.

What happens with new entries added is unspecified; but old entries removed
in parallel should never cause a violation of the rule above.
A simple index into a rebalancing btree unfortunately doesn't fulfil this;
but there are ways to add additional layers to fix it.
The easiest test for it is rm -rf.
