It's also very practical...I have _only_ KDE 3 installed, not KDE 4 ;-)
I have both Qt4 and Qt3 development (shared) libraries installed and
there is absolutely no compatibility problem, the only thing you have
to remember is when running
qmake qgit.pro
the first time, you need to be sure is the Qt4 qmake, not the Qt3.
Because I have Qt3 qmake in path, not the Qt4 one, I need to
explicitly give the whole path the first time I configure the sources,
something like
/usr/lib/qt4/bin/qmake qgit.pro
Then no other settings are needed, when you call make, the Makefiles
are already built by qmake to search for the correct libraries.
Hope this helps...
