Right.

The reason I didn't post it is that it has already scrolled off the top of
my console by the time I can read anything :-(   I can see the hex values
for the registers and hex values for the stack trace, but nothing earlier
than that.  I looked in /var/log/messages but I see that kjournald doesn't
start until well after the oops.
I thought about compiling in support for console on serial-or-parallel
port but I've never been clear on just what to plug into the serial-or-
parallel port after I've done that.  Can you give me a hint how I can
get the whole oops message for you?
