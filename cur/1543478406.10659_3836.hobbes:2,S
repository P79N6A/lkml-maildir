Hi,
I have a raid0 array of 2 disks, both of which can do ~6.5Mb/sec.
With chunksize = 4k (default), the md0 device can shift ~11.5Mb/sec. Not
bad.
However bumping up the chunksize to 64k _decreases_ performance on the
array to ~6Mb/sec. This is slower than either individual disk!
I would have thought increasing chunksize would increase performance due
to decreased overhead?
Performance measurements are taken using "hdparm"
Cheers
Chris
