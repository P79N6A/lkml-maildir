Must say I did concentrate on VGA, but the [...] bit in the quote above was 
about how everything I encountered put up a bootsplash hiding _everything_ 
and about booting into X immediately, not about FB...
I saw you remark on FB console in a reply to Alan just now and I quite agree 
with you. The (current) FB console is slow and I'll add "dumb" myself. When 
you have a 1280x1024 screen available, you get to do cool things like put up 
nice little windows and exclamation mark icons on errors, not just pretend 
you're really 132x50 (or whatever).
Alan's sketched more generic markup/unification would be The Way Forward it 
seems. Given that TWF is mostly defined as "That Which Is Not" (and how it 
seems to have a tendency to defend that status vigorously) telling me/us to 
shelve that objection for 10 years might be okay -- but generally I'm having 
a fairly hard time getting excited about printk colourizing.
Rene.
