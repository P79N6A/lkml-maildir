This patch just went to Linus.  Summary, there is a problem, their
patch makes it worse, but original problem only happens with rmmod
--wait.
BTW, "forced unloading of xxx causes yyy" reports pretty much have
to be ignored.
Cheers,
Rusty.

Subject: [PATCH 1] Set mod->waiter Before Calling stop_machine
Name: Set mod->waiter Before Calling stop_machine
Status: Tested on 2.6.5-rc1-bk4
mod->waiter needs to be set before we try to stop the module: setting
it in __try_stop_module means it gets set to the kthread, not rmmod.
Spotted by someone else, but I can't find the mail... 8(
