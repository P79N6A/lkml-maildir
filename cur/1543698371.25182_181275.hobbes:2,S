Yes and no. This is a kernel bug that trips up libproc.
The first number in a /proc/*/stat file should match
the Tgid number in the /proc/*/status file it goes with.
This is the POSIX PID. (note: NOT the "Pid" value)
Early 2.4.xx kernels didn't try to report this in
the /proc/*/status files at all, so libproc would
use the /proc/*/stat data instead. Recent 2.4.xx
kernels report the data. It seems that the data is
left uninitialized for the built-in kernel tasks.
Though there will be a work-around in future libproc
code, the 2.4.xx kernel ought to get fixed anyway.

I don't think so.

Boot from CD-ROM and reinstall the OS.
