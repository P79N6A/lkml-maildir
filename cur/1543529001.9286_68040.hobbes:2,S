Hi,
I want to debug a kernel 2.2.7 in a linux machine with Redhat 5.2.
So, i installed gdb-4.17.0.4 and the kdb-v0.6-2.2.13. I know that also i 
need gdbstub, but i don´t know what version of the gdstub is appropriate
to this versions than i have installed.
What version of gdbstub must i to install?
Where can i to get this?
I would appreciate if you could give me some help.
Thanks in advance
