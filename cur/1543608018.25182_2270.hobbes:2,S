I have a similar problem - see recent thread "Any stable 2.4 kernel?"
I received some useful suggestions:
1) For real stability, consider using 2.2
2) I'm better off then you since my machine stays up for days/weeks.
I had the best luck with 2.4.3 so far (weeks of uptime).
However, when it locks up not even power-off button works.
I have to unplug the power.
3) Default eepro100 driver can be problematic, and some comercial 
distros use Intel's driver. I don't know if it can cause such hard 
lockups (anybody comment, please?) but it seems like the next candidate
to consider (after mboard and highmem).
