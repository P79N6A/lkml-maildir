The Coverity checker spotted the following:
<--  snip  -->
...
static __inline__ struct svc_fh *
fh_copy(struct svc_fh *dst, struct svc_fh *src)
{
        if (src->fh_dentry || src->fh_locked) {
                struct dentry *dentry = src->fh_dentry;
                printk(KERN_ERR "fh_copy: copying %s/%s, already verified!\n",
                        dentry->d_parent->d_name.name, dentry->d_name.name);
        }
                        
        *dst = *src;
        return dst;
}
...
<--  snip  -->
src->fh_dentry is being dereferenced when we discover it's NULL...
