You're a few years too late for that line to work ;)

I fail to see how holding my entire directory structure in memory (well,
not the entire thing -- the second find went just as slow) for 15 days is
useful... especially when I'm attempting to run programs and watching them
get killed because there's no more memory left..

Right.  But pressure did demand so, and give back it did not.  The memory
is lost until a reboot... processes are never given a chance to use it. 
Somehow, I don't think this is the way it should be.
