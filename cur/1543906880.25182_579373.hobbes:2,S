Subject: [BUG  RT] - rcupreempt.c:133 on 2.6.23-rc1-rt7

Why is it, that every time I go to write examples for my chapter in a
book, that I hit a bug!
I got this on bootup of my Thinkpad G41 running SMP.
Installing knfsd (copyright (C) 1996 okir@monad.swb.de).

 =======================
I don't have time to look further now, and it's something that isn't
easily reproducible (Well, it happened once out of two boots). If you
need me to look further, or need a config or dmesg (I have both), then
just give me a holler.
