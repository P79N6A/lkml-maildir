Hello,
I have an older machine that fails to find the AT keyboard.   The machine is
based
on an Intel 7501 chipset.
Under the default fedora core 4 kernel, it found the keyboard and that
keyboard
worked in UP mode, in SMP mode the machine crashed, but that is a different
issue.
Under 2.6.13.1 the machine boots under SMP and does not crash, dmesg does
not report
the keyboard being found, and the keyboard fails to work.  The .config file
does have
CONFIG_KEYBOARD_ATKBD set to Y.   The keyboard was being found was seen on
the default
fedora core 4 kernel.   There are no extra options on the boot cmdline.
The important messages seem to be:
Fedora Core 4 default UP kernel boot:
Sep 15 19:55:12 node001 kernel: serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
Sep 15 19:55:12 node001 kernel: serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
Sep 15 19:55:12 node001 kernel: input: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard on
isa0060/serio0
New boot (2.6.13.1 smp boot)
Sep 15 21:12:35 node001 kernel: i8042.c: Can't read CTR while initializing
i8042.
The i8042 is of course missing out of /proc/interrupts on the new boot.
The .config file is copied from the original non-working smp fedora core 4
kernel, 
and then "make oldconfig".
Any ideas where to look?   Any patches in the git kernels that might address
this
issue?
                 Roger
