this mechanizm is already part of the scheduler and is not affected by my
patch. Interactive tasks get their '->counter' value increased gradually
via the recalculate code in the scheduler, which after some time gives
them effective priority above that of CPU-intensive processes.
To see this mechanizm working, just boot into the stock kernel or try a
kernel with the patch applied, start a few CPU-intensive processes, eg.
a couple of subshells doing an infinite loop:
	while N=1; do N=1; done &
	while N=1; do N=1; done &
	while N=1; do N=1; done &
	while N=1; do N=1; done &
and see how the interactive shell is still responding instantaneously in
such a mixed workload, despite having the same static priority as the
subshells.
