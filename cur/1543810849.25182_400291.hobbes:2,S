So that was the point not the rescheduling under lock? Or both?
BTW since it touches your area of work you could comment what
you think about not using voluntary preempt points for fast sleep locks
like I later proposed.

Great we agree then.

Sorry, but I don't think that's true. Mean spirited would be
"we don't care, go away".  When I think that I generally don't 
answer the email.
I could have perhaps worded it a bit nicer, agreed, but I think
the core of my reply - we need more analysis for that - was
quite constructive. At least for one of the subproblems I even
proposed a better solution. If there is more analysis of the
problem maybe I can help even for more of it.
Also it's probably quite clear that added lots of special purpose caches
to task_struct for narrow purpose isn't a good way to do optimization.
The mail was perhaps a bit harsher than it should have been
because I think Arjan should have really known better...

I must say I'm feeling a bit unfairly attacked here because I think I generally
try to help new patch submitters (at least if their basic ideas are sound even
if some details are wrong)
e.g. you might notice that a lot of patches from new contributors
go smoother into x86-64 than into i386.
