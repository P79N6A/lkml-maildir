Hi all,
I only just noticed this, but been building kernel source for a long time.  On 
my 233 over ssh, it is a bit slow, and I just noticed this output when doing 
a 'make menuconfig':
make[1]: `scripts/fixdep' is up to date.
scripts/kconfig/mconf arch/i386/Kconfig
optimize  &&  ?
optimize  &&  ?
optimize  &&  ?
optimize  &&  ?
Are the  optimize  &&  ? lines normal?  I investigated, but can't work it out.  
This is from a current tree that has an uptime of > 50 days - I just needed 
to change one option in the build, so the existing .config is good.
Thanks,
Nick
