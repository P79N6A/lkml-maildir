XFS always has the XFS i_lock around accessing it.  Either in read mode
or in write mode for updates (the lock is a so-called mrlock which
basically as a rwsem with a few subtile differences).
Anyway most acceses i_size in the new code are done by the generic
code now as XFS calls it internally.  Take a look at the update I sent
you a few seconds ago :)
