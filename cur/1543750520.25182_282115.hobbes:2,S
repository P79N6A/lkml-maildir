I think you missed the point. I'll reexplain:
what do you is
syscall_wrapper()
{
	original_syscall_that_copies_the_numbers_to_userspace();
	kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL); <-- can sleep
	copy_numbers_back_from_userspace();
}
it is REALLY easy for another thread of the userspace program that did
the syscall to change IT'S OWN MEMORY where the 2 FD numbers are stored
between the moment the original syscall copies them there, and the
moment you *recopy* them back.
