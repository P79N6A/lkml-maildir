Hypocrisy, Jeff.  In your previous mail you complained that kbuild 2.5
was not ready to go in.  When I point out that not only is it ready but
it can go in without breaking the existing code, then you complain that
I am not breaking anything.  Make up your mind.

The old code does not live on indefinitely, it gets removed as soon as
kbuild 2.5 is deemed stable.  Four weeks, tops.

Only for as long as it takes to prove that kbuild 2.5 is ready.

I have given up trying to get patches into 2.5.  The Linus black hole
swallows them all.
