Or else keep track separately in cpusets of
- cpus that the cpuset can run on
- cpus that the admin has specified for the cpu to run on
hotplug/hotunplug events would only affect the former; userspace would
only see/modify the latter. Then when hibernate is over and the CPUs
are hotplugged back in, things would be back as before.
