Dammit, Eric, you spend a lot of time using words like "insane" where
you mean we didn't do everything all at once.
It's *not* clear that using %esi is sane, but nothing in the current
code prevents that.
I was trying to get Xen to use this entry point rather than their own: I
failed, and only lguest now uses it.
Fortunately, this also means it's trivial to change.
Rusty.
