Your driver's write method looks like:
mutex_lock();
poke_some_hardware();
wait_event_uninterruptible(); //for result
res = evaluate_result();
mutex_unlock();
return res;
If you put a task into the refrigerator at wait_event_interruptible()
you will deadlock if you need this lock for the driver to go to suspend.
The suspend method then must not take the lock _and_ it must be
aware that there may be an ongoing operation.
