the goals of resource isolation and optimal overall
performance are often in conflict, and there are
definitely cases when one really needs performance
isolation across processes inspite of the slight
performance hit this may entail.

I agree thats an issue -- how to treat shared pages is
a policy decision which may vary with the exact
requirements, but the general mechanism to be able to
monitor resident sets on a per process basis seems to
be useful.  How to treat shared pages could be a
user-specified parameter.

I am concerned about reasonably long running processes
-- in those cases, limiting cpu usage need not
necessarily lead to bounds on resident set size --
what about a process that reads in a large file abt
the size of main memory ? it doesnt need much cpu, but
can fill up your memory.

again, I disagree.  Though it may be true in certain
cases, there are situations when a user knows better
about the relative importance of the processes he
runs. Wherever one desires performance isolation,
having per-process control over resource usage is
definitely a useful mechanism.
