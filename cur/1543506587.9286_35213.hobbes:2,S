I have a new RH6.0 system and everythng seems to be working great on it,
but I am getting a thing that is causing me a little concern and I want to
see if it is anything to be worried about.
THE SPECS:
	Dual PII-400
	256MB ECC PC100 memory
	Adaptec 7980 SCSI Controller on motherboard
	1 9.1GB Ultra2 SCSI Drive (Quantum)
	1 Host Independent RAID Controller  (UWSCSI)
		w/ 1 18GB RAID5 Array  (3x 9.1GB)
	Kernel 2.2.10

I notice when I execute a "time <command>"m I end up seeing a lot of
pagefaults in my output.  It doesn't seem to be  causing any problems but
before I write it off as nothing I wanted to get an opinion here.
Here's the output from a kernel compile to give you an example:
[/usr/src/linux] # time make
266.88user 20.66system 4:47.87elapsed 99%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (-495975500major+15152975minor)pagefaults 0swaps
[/usr/src/linux] # time make -j 2 
261.12user 19.01system 2:27.53elapsed 189%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (1538887856major+-51006598minor)pagefaults 0swaps

Anything that I need to concern myself with?  I'd obviously rather not go
down the road of returning memory or CPU if I can help it.
