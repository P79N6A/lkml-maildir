Hi and Merry Xmas everyone!
I just have a little question, is there a way to turn on IGMP support in 
the kernel?, I removed
multicast support but is that enugh?
They said that you could see if you are vulnerable by looking at these 
files:
/proc/net/igmp
/proc/net/mcfilter
and if both existed and were non-emptu you were vulnerable.
On a defualt installation on Slackware 10 the files mcfilter
is empty but on other servers with various kernel versions
both files contains some data.
The slackware machine is running 2.4.24. As i said i removed
multicast support in the kernel but when i compiled it i saw
that it created igmp.o anyway.
Any advice about how people can patch this security issue?
Thnx!
//David
