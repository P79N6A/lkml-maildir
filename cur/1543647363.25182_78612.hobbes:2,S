That would be wonderful -- except those asm-*/fcntl.h values are
also duplicated in arch specific include/bits/fcntl.h files in
glibc, uClibc, etc and are compiled into zillions of existing
binaries.  Change it and you break binary compatibility...
So if your going to have a flag day, you will need to coordinate
that change with a bunch of non-kernel people as well.
