Yes, that is the problem.  I'll wait for a future release.

I tried that, but the Symbios SCSI controller freaks out with noapic.
I can be more detailed if that would be useful.  I can also try a
non-smp kernel and run the machine with 1 processor and 8GB, if you
think that would be useful in solving the problem.
I appreciate your help in this, as yes, the problem is indeed a nice
one...
