Hi,
I found that Linux 2.4.x got locking with apm.o and yenta_socket.o
since yenta driver was there. But, someone has reported another apm.o
related locking. I don't know about why this problem causes and who
works for this. 
So, I want more infomations, i.e. situation, position, timing and so on.
Tell me these if you know.
I know a locking situation:
* apm.o and yenta_socket.o are loaded and scan devices.
* `cat /proc/apm` or something that causes calling apm_bios_call().
-> hardware locking. Nothing except turn off with the power switch.
Any infos welcome. Thanks.
