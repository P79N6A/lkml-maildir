In this patch, io_request_lock and queue_lock are both acquired in  
generic_unplug_device, so request_fn invocations protect request queue 
integrity.  __make_request acquires queue_lock instead of io_request_lock 
thus protecting queue integrity while allowing greater concurrency.
Nevertheless, I understand your unwillingness to change locking as 
pervasive as io_request_lock.  Such changes would of course involve 
risk.  I am simply trying to improve 2.4 i/o performance, since 2.4
could have a long time left to live.

Yes, calling out of subsystem scope with locks held can cause problems.
Thanks for your feedback.
