You are assuming that the ondisk representation is a binary blob.  If
you store a string representation as your security label, then your
userspace tools can operate on it cleanly without caring what it
actually means.  SELinux includes patched versions of many of the user
utilities that can get or set file security labels, and it doesn't
matter whether the security label consists of a MLS range or a TE domain
or a RBAC role or any combination of them.
For MAC, you want to preserve meaningful security information on the
filesystem partition itself (and in any backups), not some arbitrary
integer that might be remapped at any time to a completely different
meaning or that might mean something quite different if you mount the
disk on some other system.  A human-readable string representation is
preferable here.

Again, if you are using a string representation, then most of your
userland can simply display it or take input from the user and pass it
down without caring about the meaning of the string.
