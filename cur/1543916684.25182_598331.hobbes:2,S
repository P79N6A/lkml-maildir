No, i did not manage to improve (it should NOT be a dangerous error BTW).
I simply think that this issue is because of buggy firmware, so i
posted to linux-ide a patch to blacklist this hard disk from using NCQ
(because it is triggering spurious completions).
I don't know what the "blacklisting policy" is for linux kernel
developers, i think that, since there probably are a lot of buggy
drives for NCQ and so, a module parameter to disable NCQ while loading
libata could be useful.
Best regards.
