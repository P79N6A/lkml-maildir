Thanks, I'll give it a try!
I was just playing with varmon.
It's OK.  It seems to do the same set of things
that I can do through the /proc/rd/c0/user_command
interface.  I can take drives offline, put them
back online, make drives standby, do consistency
checks.
But, I can't delete or create logical devices,
I'm forced to do that through the Mylex BIOS during
system boot.
I've not given a lot of thought to where those
restrictions come from.  Certainly part of the
problem is a lack of specifications for Mylex.
It'd be really nice of global array manager could
do these things.
I'll give it a try.
