Hello, out there.
I already sent a mail to the maintainer chaffee@cs.berkeley.edu, but did not
receive a reply for a week, so I'm not sure if he received my mail.
I have encountered a FAT32 partition created by Windoze98 that Linux cannot
mount.
 # fdisk -l /dev/hdaI have encountered a FAT32 partition created by Windoze98
 # that Linux cannot
 mount.
 # fdisk -l /dev/hda
 Disk /dev/hda: 255 heads, 63 sectors, 2482 cylinders

# mount -o debug -t vfat /dev/hda3 /mnt/DOS_hda3
fatfs: bogus cluster size
 The other partitions give no trouble at all. I tried 3.2.14 and
 several 2.3 releases up to 2.3.99-pre1.
 All the Windoze partitions work fine in Windoze98, and all except the big
 /dev/hda3 are mountable under every version of Linux I tried.
 I have no idea about filesystems, so I cannot fix the problem myself. If
 anybody cares to look at it, I will try to help.
 Thank you. Andreas
