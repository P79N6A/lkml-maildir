That has always seemed unnatural to me.  By keeping everything
in the one tree you can easily:
- collapse patches together:
	pushpatch first-patch
	for i in $(cat pc/second-patch.pc)
		fpatch $i
	done
	patch -p1 < patches/second-patch.patch
	refpatch
- Reorder patches (edit series file, poppatch 10; pushpatch 10)
- Remove a patch which is partway down the stack:
	rpatch patch-7-out-of-10
- make changes to a not-topmost patch without having to do
  anything special.
Dunno.  There are probably ways of doing all these things with a
whole-tree copy, but I haven't tried to plot it all out.
Changelog tracking is fairly important to me also.
