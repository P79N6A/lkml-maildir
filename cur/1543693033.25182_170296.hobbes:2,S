I am working with a pc system that has no swap space and no hard disk.
I have direct control over 3 processes on this system and need to
guarantee that they never use more than 190 MB of memory.  I have been
getting the information about memory usage from /proc/*pid*/status but can
not seem to make exact sense of what it is reporting.  Here are the values
I am getting:

I have read in many places that VmSize is the total in-memory size of the
running process, but does this include memory that is being shared?  I
thought about adding VmRSS, VmData, and VmStk, but that is greater than
VmSize?   Can anyone tell me what is the amount of memory solely used by a
process?  It's my understanding that my system should crash if these three
processes exceed 190 MB, but using /proc/*pid* values does not confirm
this...
please CC me on any responses:  kkahley@cs.uic.edu
Thank you much in advance.
