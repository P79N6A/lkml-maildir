Then for each struct page making up that huge page, clear all the flags
(see how the flags are cleared in mm/page_alloc.c#bad_page()), set the
count to 1 (set_page_count(page, 1)) and free it as an order 0 page
(__free_page(page, 0)). Some will end up on the per-cpu lists and if the
lists are full, they will end up on the zone free lists as expected. This
is similar to what happens when the buddy allocator is being setup so look
at mm/bootmem.c#free_all_bootmem_core(pg_data_t) to get an idea of what
has to happen.
