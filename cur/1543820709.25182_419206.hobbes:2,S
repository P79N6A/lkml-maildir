Yes, on AMD processors, speculative execution is allowed to install TLB translations. Assuming you are not in 64-bit mode, and can not use
mmx or sse instructions to zero out the naturally aligned 64-bit pte,
then what is being suggested makes sense: clear out the valid bit
first by writing the low 32-bits. No invalid translations are ever 
installed in the TLB.

Maybe the barrier is needed for other architectures, but two writes
to WB memory are not going to happen out of order and so no
barrier is needed on x86 to the best of my knowledge.
