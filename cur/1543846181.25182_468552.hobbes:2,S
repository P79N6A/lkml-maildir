[multiple hierarchies]  I'd say let's pretend we don't know how to
do them, until we have good reason otherwise.  Having just a single
resource hierarchy simplifies the thinking of these things.  If doing
so fits 90% of the needs, and can be stretched to get most of the
remaining needs, then that simplification is well worth it.  It might
mean that a reasonable number of people can actually understand this
stuff, which is always a nice property.
