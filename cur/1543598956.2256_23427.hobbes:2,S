Couldn't the bonding code be made to distribute pkts to one interface or
another based on a hash of the sending IP port or something?  Seems like that
would fix the reordering problem for IP packets....  It wouldn't help for
a single stream, but I'm guessing the real world problem involves many streams,
which on average should hash such that the load is balanced...
