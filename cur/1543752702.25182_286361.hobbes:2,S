I guess it depends on how you look at it. In fact, thinking again, I think
it gives the same time to the bad and good guys in each case. So it seems
there is no benefit to having a closed list or an open list in this regard
after all. And if this is not an issue, what might be the reason for having
the closed list? The lust for glory as you've said earlier?

Indeed, but what does have it to do with a closed disclosure list? With open
disclosure list you provide a set of fixes right away, the admins take them
and apply. With closed list you do the same, but with a delay (which gives
an opportunity for a "race condition" with the bad guys, one could argue).
So, what's the advantage of the delayed disclosure?
