    Yes if it is stuck in that state forever, but I've suffered
processes stuck in 'D' state due to, for example, my CD recorder
frozen... It can last more than 600 seconds, and it's not a kernel
bug, just a 'long-lasting' transient state ;)
    Anyway, last time I had a process stuck in 'D' state was back in
2.2 kernel, more than a year ago.
