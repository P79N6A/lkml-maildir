What can we do reasonably sanely? I think we can drive about 16GB of
highmem per 1GB of normal fairly well. So on your 1TB system, you
should be able to unplug 960GB RAM.
Lower the ratio to taste if you happen to be doing something
particularly zone normal intensive - remember in that case the frag
patches won't buy you anything more because a zone normal intensive
workload is going to cause unreclaimable regions by definition.

Perhaps. Perhaps it wouldn't be required to get a solution that is
"good enough" though.
But if you can reclaim your ZONE_RECLAIMABLE, then you could reclaim
it all and expand your normal zones into it, bottom up.

We didn't get it right, but there are fairly simple things we can do
(http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=113082256231168&w=2)
to improve things remarkably, and having yet more users should result
in even more improvements.
We still have ZONE_DMA and ZONE_DMA32, so we can't just afford to
abandon zones because they're crap ;)

I think this would defeat the purpose if we really want to set limits,
but we could have a sysctl perhaps to turn it on or off, or say, only
allow it if the alternative is going OOM.
