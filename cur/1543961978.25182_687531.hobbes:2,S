"simple"?  What I had was a lot simpler.
So, I want to set gpio 5 on a pcf9557 extender.
cat 1 > /sys/class/gpio/pcf9557-0:0
But now I can't do this anymore, it has to be harder.  So how do I do it?  It
doesn't seem very considerate to ignore the real use cases of the person who
wrote the code to begin with.

I have a JTAG interface implemented via GPIOs.  With my system, one can see
the gpios used in sysfs with the proper labels (TCK, TDO, TDI, etc.).  This is
very helpful for people connecting something to the interface to know they
have the write gpio lines connected.  What's the point of allowing
one to label gpio lines if it's not going to be easy to see?
It also means that if they have trouble getting what their connecting to work,
they can always control the line via sysfs and see with a probe that it
changes.  They can raise TRST (which they know is the right line from the
label) and see the system reset.
Adding gpio_export() calls to the kernel source and recompiling and
re-flashing just isn't going to happen for a large portion of users.
Why can't the gpio lines just show up when something requests them?

So if a driver is already using gpio 23, then there is no way to see it in
sysfs, since the gpio_request() will fail?

So if a driver was already using gpio 23 and you wanted to look at it from
userspace, you'll free it from both sysfs and the driver that was using it
when you're done?

You could say the same about 90% of the writable files in sysfs.
