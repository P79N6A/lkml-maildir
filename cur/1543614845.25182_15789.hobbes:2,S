To the best of my recollection, the line bit (symbol) rate is fixed
at, ideally, 2048000 bps.  At least with HDB3 line coding, a
sequence of 4 consecutive zeroes is replaced with three midscale
values one the line, and a mark that violates the normal mark
alternation scheme.  I.e. 1,0,0,0,0 might be replaced with +,0,0,0,+
Thus, the "payload" data rate of 2048000 equals the line symbol
rate of 2048000 symbols/sec.  (Of course, this isn't really the
"payload" data, since it includes the framing slots and all that,
but...)
