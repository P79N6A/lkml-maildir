First of all, /proc/bus/usb/* is not a proc filesystem, usbfs is mounted
in that location :)
The main reason is this information is no longer available to the USB
core.  It isn't keeping a list of registered drivers anymore, only the
driver core is.  So there's no way that usbfs can get to that
information.  As the info is available in driverfs, duplication of it in
usbfs would be bloat.
