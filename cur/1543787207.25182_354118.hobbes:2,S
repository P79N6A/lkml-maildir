Just reproduced the exact same message with a vanilla 2.6.13.2.
Checking the just-untarred sources, it _is_ in aix79xx_osm.c, in
ahd_linux_abort.  You must have typoed "Attempting" in your grep :-)
Want be to try to BUG() it or something to get a stack trace?  The
crash happens a handful of seconds after the card dumping, time enough
for a well-placed dmesg in an xterm.
Incidentally, how can one get a backtrace without crashing the kernel
in the operation?
  OG.
