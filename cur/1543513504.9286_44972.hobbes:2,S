Donald, read my emails.
They have NOT been rejected.
The haven't even been CONSIDERED. There's a bug difference there.
And the reason they haven't even been considered is that you have not sent
in any patches to me. I have not seen the patches, I have only seen the
results of Alan applying the patches to the ac tree and various
bug-reports. 
And I will repeat my rule: I do not apply large patches with many separate
changes. I apply patches that do one thing (like implement a PCI search
function).
