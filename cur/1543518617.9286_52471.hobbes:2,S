clone()ing costs go up immediately, from the current 10 usecs cost to
create a process to 50-100 usecs, plus MM handling gets more complicated.
Plus in PAE mode this would be even more complicated (because two levels
need to be private to the thread). I dont think this brings any good.
what you propose is not possible without destroying true threads.
