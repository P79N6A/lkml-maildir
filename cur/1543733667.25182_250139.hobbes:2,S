That is correct. The current definition is to ensure that previously
sent writes are on disk. I hope to tie a range to it in the future, for
devices that can optimize the flush in that case. So for ide with write
back caching, it's currently a FLUSH_CACHE command. Ditto for SCSI. SCSI
with write through cache can make it a noop as well.

Right on.

Not necessarily, if you have write caching enabled.

How would md know? The lower level driver knows what to do (if anything)
to ensure the data is safe.

Yes and no. Currently it's used to fsync(), but can be used for
anything where you want to insert a flush point without having a piece
of data to tie it to.
