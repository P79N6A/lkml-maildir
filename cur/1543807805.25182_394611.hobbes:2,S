All you've explained is that using SCSI ID for device names is the way
you want cdrecord to work, not why it's infinitely better than using real
device names like every other userland program on every OS in existance.
And please name a case where 'cdrecord dev=/dev/cdrom file.iso' won't work
reliably because I, and it would seem many others, haven't run into it.
there was the case where recording audio doesn't do DMA, but that's a bug
in ide-scsi and I AFAIK it doesn't matter whether you use dev=/scd0 or
dev=1,0,0 to address the drive.  And also, I believe dev=/dev/scd0 will
work with ide-scsi in 2.4, but I don't have a machine to test that on.
The people replying here are your users, if you don't want to listen to
them pretty much any conversation with you will be a waste of time.
Jim.
