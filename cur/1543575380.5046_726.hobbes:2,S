Subject: 2.2.18-25 has serious sickness with Xconfigurator

Use of Xconfigurator with the 2.2.18-25 pre-patch causes hard hangs
and lockups on a 4 x PPro server.  I am using it with frame buffer 
support enabled, AGP enabled, and with the /dev/agpgart device
at maj 10 min 175 set to crw-rw-rw-.
XF86Setup runs fine provided you know what card or chipset you're on.
Whatever changed has broken the auto-probing in Xconfigurator.  During 
hardware probe, it just sits there and hangs.
The PS/2 mouse problems are gone, however.
