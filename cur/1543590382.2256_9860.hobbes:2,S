Well, you can select '(586/K5/5x86/6x86/6x86MX) Processor family '
in the  'Processor type and features ' menu of menuconfig.
That's what I do for a Geode GXLv,
and it works with 2.2 and 2.4 kernels.
There is one version (maybe more ?),
I think 2.4.1, which cannot boot on Cyrix,
but others works well...
Regards.
