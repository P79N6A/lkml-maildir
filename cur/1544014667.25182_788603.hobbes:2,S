A key fact which may not have stood out, since I didn't comment on it
explicitly in the code, is that the disqualification tests inserted by
the __sock_sendmsg() and unix_dgram_sendmsg hunks contain additional
conditions like
__sock_sendmsg():
+               && (msg->msg_name != NULL || msg->msg_namelen != 0))
unix_dgram_sendmsg():
+                       && !sunaddr->sun_path[0])
which return us to the usual codepaths whenever we're dealing with an
already-connected socket. Since my tests pass, can you post an example
of a failing send() call which you think should work?

As far as I can tell, sendfile() and splice(), which operate solely on
fds, cannot be used to send messages via a disconnected socket.
Therefore, I /believe/ that they require no modification. Am I terribly
mistaken about this?
Thanks,
