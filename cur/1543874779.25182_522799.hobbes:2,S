Hi again Eric,
	Unfortunately not.  It probably should, though: people ignore printks.
I was probably thinking that large alignment constraints were only for
performance when I wrote this code, but a page-aligned requirement for
hypervisors changes that.

Um, yes, always good to remember.  I wrote the per-cpu infrastructure,
and I haven't forgotten 8)

It should Just Work.  My only hesitation is that I obviously thought
different when I wrote this code, so am I smarter now, or then?

This makes a lot of sense.  A fixed constant seemed sensible at the
time, but now we know that the majority of per-cpu vars are in code
which can never be a module.  Reasons are obvious, and seem unlikely to
change.

But it doesn't get called on UP.  Don't know if that matters, but it
wasn't immediately obvious.
Thanks,
Rusty.
