That's right.

Yes, this should be the first thing to be fixed.

Since ieee1394 doesn't create chained s/g lists, we might even get away
with ieee1394's existing iterators.
(The other place where the 1394 stack deals with s/g lists is sbp2 where
we have to deal with what comes from the SCSI stack or the block layer.
But sbp2's s/g list handling is entirely unrelated to ieee1394's own
code for isochronous I/O and async streams, which eth1394 needs and
caused the bug.)
