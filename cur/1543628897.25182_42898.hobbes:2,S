OK, I'll add this link, but I'd feel more comfortable adding this if
there was a URL I could quote for the opposing view, and hence be more
balanced. But I guess no-one has bothered to write a manifesto. If
someone has or does, let me know.
The purpose of the FAQ entry isn't to support a particular view, but
to serve as a "State of the Community" notice.

Adding a URL is good. Fortunately, some other people have sent me the
URL, so I can include that as well now.
