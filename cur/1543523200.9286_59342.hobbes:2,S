libc has absolutely nothing to do with a kernel patch which does
"s/printk/printf/"
However, I don't think the change is worth the hassle...  Having code
which is common code between userspace and kernelspace is nice when
possible, but I don't believe in bending over backwards to support such
scenarios...
