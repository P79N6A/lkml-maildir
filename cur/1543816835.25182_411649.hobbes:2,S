Fair, I need to think on that a little more.

I don't consider it speculative.  The patch is for a generic DMA  
engine interface.  That interface should encompass all users.  I have  
a security/crypto DMA engine that I'd like to front with the generic  
DMA interface today.  Also, I believe there is another Intel group  
with an XOR engine that had a similar concept called ADMA posted a  
while ago.

Can you explain what the semantics are.
It's been a little while since I posted so my thoughts on the subject  
are going to take a little while to come back to me :)
