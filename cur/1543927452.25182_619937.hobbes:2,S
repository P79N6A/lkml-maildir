Hi,
I'm looking at the linux uvc driver, and noticed after resuming my
notebook it deadlocks at usb_set_interface.
The linux kernel version on that notebook is 2.6.21.4, I searched
around and haven't found any such bugreports.
I wonder if anyone has ever heard about such a problem?
I'm digging closer into that issue now..
thanks,
Markus
