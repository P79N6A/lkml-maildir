All the machines have Forerunner LE ATM NICs and use LAN
Emulation. I made an attempt to check whether the problems also occur
with ethernet, but for some reason the ethernet card also
didn't seem to work with 2.4.22. Maybe I should give this another
try ...
As mentioned, Adrian's patch for "CONFIG_X86_L1_CACHE_SHIFT"
seems to fix my current networking problems, but maybe the real
cause is something else.
Since somebody here mentioned "memory corruption": Already for
years I have been plagued by a bug somewhere in the ATM/LANE code
that causes the machines to crash from time to time (see
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=445059&group_id=7812&atid=107812
)
I could not discover any pattern, when and under which
circumstances these crashes happen (usually, they occur with
several months in between) Several times, I managed to get at
least a stack trace, but the actual crashes occured at different
places in the code (which, I guess, could mean that the real
problem is somebody overwriting somebody elses memory). Could
there be any connection?
If somebody has any good idea how to find out, what is going on,
I'll be glad to investigate this further. At least, with my
current networking problems (see the thread "2.4.22 with
CONFIG_M686: networking broken") I have a test case ...
