[Please CC me on replies, thx]
I use usbfs, but normally have only a single USB device connected, a
generic mouse.  When usbfs is unmounted on shutdown, I see "BUG at
inode.c:1034" in between 5% and 50% of all cases, the backtrace being
iput(), free_inode(), usbdevfs_put_super(), kill_super(), __mntput(),
etc.
I believe this to be a long standing problem, I remember seeing this
in 2.2.x as well, more than a year ago.  Then I moved the mouse to a
2.4.x system, and I've seen the problem ever since.  As a workaround,
I have moved the "umount /proc/bus/usb" after all disk umounts, but I
believe I've now finally tracked down the cause.
drivers/usb/inode.c says that all calls of its inode-list-manipulating
functions must occur with the kernel lock held.  usbdevfs_read_super()
does _not_ do this, however, and I strongly suspect that my mouse is
auto-detected (occasionally) exactly while usbfs is being mounted.
The result is that the same inode ends up twice in usbfs's lists,
hence the "BUG in inode.c:1034" when it is iput() twice on shutdown.
The appended patch has fixed the problem for me, although I've only
done a few boot cycles with it.
Regards,
Wolfram.
