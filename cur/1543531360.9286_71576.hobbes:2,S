As long as most servers decide to use our default uid/gid this should
not be necessary.

The Sun RPC scheme which lies beneath NFS, relies on the client being
able to identify itself in some way. The most common (but by no means
the only) is to use UNIX uid/gid + 16 groups. Normally the server will
do something like an setfsuid() setfsgid() to the values of the
uid/gid passed for RPC authentication before treating our NFS request.

See 
http://nfs.sourceforge.net
, you'll find a full FAQ.

By all means do if you think it is needed. I've only gone as far as
making it a compile option.
