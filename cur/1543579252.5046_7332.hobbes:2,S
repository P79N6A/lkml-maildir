Agreed. However since TCP_CORK logic is more generic than MSG_MORE and so it
still makes sense for some usage I think it worth to optimize the TCP_CORK
logic too and this new functionality _may_ be useful not just for TCP_CORK.

Doing PUSH from setsockopt(TCP_CORK) looked obviously wrong because it isn't
setting any socket state, and also because the SIOCPUSH has nothing specific
with TCP_CORK, as said it can be useful also to flush the last fragment of data
pending in the send queue without having to wait all the unacknowledged data to
be acknowledged from the receiver when TCP_NODELAY isn't set.
Changing the semantics of setsockopt(TCP_CORK, 2) would also break backwards
compatibility with all 2.[24].x kernels out there.
