All of my testing has been on desktop machines, although in most cases 
they were really loaded desktops which had load avg 10..100 from time to 
time, and none were low memory machines. Up to CFS v3 I thought 
nicksched was my winner, now CFSv3 looks better, by not having stumbles 
under stupid loads.
I have not tested:
   1 - server loads, nntp, smtp, etc
   2 - low memory machines
   3 - uniprocessor systems
I think this should be done before drawing conclusions. Or if someone 
has tried this, perhaps they would report what they saw. People are 
talking about smoothness, but not how many pages per second come out of 
their overloaded web server.
