My bad sorry I'm addicted to a graphical MUA. The best I can do is inline the 
attachment. I could probably cut and paste but I'm afraid of mangling the 
patch.

Yeah I like that idea.

Hmm got any ideas?

Do you mean not pass the irq variables and just check for if (in_irq()) ?

Well ioapic_edge_type_irq0 doesn't exist on !CONFIG_NO_IDLE_HZ and this was a 
way of avoiding ifdefs in this .c file. I'll think about it again.

Might or is certain to? I don't really have hardware to test this hypothesis 
(nor do I know how) so I'd like to know how likely you think it is, and if 
there is some obvious way to improve this?
Thanks very much for your comments!
