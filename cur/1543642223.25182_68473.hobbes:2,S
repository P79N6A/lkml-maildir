Please explain. I don't think that matters here:
Both _bits and _size are unsigned int, same amount of stuff to load. 
The one single per-packet-path use is in hash_conntrack(), where
the _bits thing can be used without touching the _size thing.
All other places where the patch now uses _bits, really need _size,
and do the ugly computation by shifting. And all those other places
are called very rarely.
So, I don't see how your (abstractly true) observation is relevant, here.
best regards
