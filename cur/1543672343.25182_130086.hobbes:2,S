So what ?
You just find the right address (in this case by getting the addresses of
exported syscalls and finding a list in memory, containing them in the
right order), and cast it to be the syscall table.  If you want it to work
with a binary-only driver, you can even insmod a small module that does
that and adds the result to the symbol table for other modules to use.
We've been doing that for years on closed-source systems like AIX.  The
above is just one way to locate a struct in memory.  A faster way is to
find some exported structs which are known to point to the unexported
symbol from some offset, extract the symbol's address, and "re-export" it.
In fact, in linux which is opensource, you can probably write a script
that extracts any unexported symbol from the source code, find a path to
it from some exported symbol, and automagically create a module that
re-exports this symbol for your legacy driver to use.
If you write the script, don't forget to GPL it :)
