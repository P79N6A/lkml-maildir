Granted that this is possible, yet how likely is it that two people
would come up with the same problem, when they don't even know each
other. 2nd, this was a fresh tree, i.e. 2.4.0 from tar.bz2, patch to
2.4.1, then patch to 2.4.1-ac20, therefore there likely must be
something else. Maybe a similarly corrupted (shouldn't be possible w/
bz2, let alone gz) 2.4.1 patch, or some such. Still, given that it was a
d/l from zeus.kernel.org, it should be ok (short of somebody hacking the
server. I rarely check the sigs)
