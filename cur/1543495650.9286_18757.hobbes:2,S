Hello!
   This is followup to my prev post.
   I found where div by zero occurs, in linux/include/net/tcp.h: 
extern __inline__ __u32 tcp_recalc_ssthresh(struct tcp_opt *tp)
{
       __u32 snd_wnd_packets = tp->snd_wnd / tp->mss_cache;
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                  Here.
                                 Ain't we can have mss_cache == 0???
Bye,
    Oleg
