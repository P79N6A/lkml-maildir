Contrary to popular misconceptions, PEOPLE DON'T CARE!
The fact that our forefathers were Pascal-programmers, and started
counting from one does not mean that we have to continue that mistake
forever.  We've since moved on to C, and the change from 1999->2000 is a
lot more interesting in a base-10 system than the change from
2000->2001. 
The reference point of our timekeeping is based on an event where the
uncertainty about the timing is much more than a year, and was made up
several hundred years AFTER the fact.  As such, if you want to be a
stickler, you might as well say that the next millenium may have started
several years ago. 
So please stop sending me email.  You don't have to celebrate if you
don't want to.  But let the rest of the world who doesn't care about
silly irrelevant details (what's a millenium to you anyway) just go on
with our life.

PS. NEXT year I may agree with you. I'll join the ranks of people with
no life but the ability to count in another 360 days or so. But that's
mainly in order to have an excuse to go out to town.
