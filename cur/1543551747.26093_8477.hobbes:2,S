Correct. But the problem is that the page won't stay in physical memory after
we finished the I/O because swap cache with page count 1 will be freed by the
VM.  And even it stays in physical memory because a read fault happened on the
swap cache before we freed it, we could have swap cache that isn't coherent
with the on-disk data (that could lead to the same problem but later).
And anyways from a design standpoint it looks much better to really pin the
page in the pte too (just like kernel reserved pages are pinend after a
remap_page_range).

I see your point but if you want to allow that we should simply check if the
page that we can't lock is just locked in the earlier part of the kiobuf (just
browsing backwards the iobuf->maplist). I just don't think that not locking the
page is the right way to provide that feature.
I think it's not horribly wrong if people can't do map_user_kiobuf on virtual
pages pointing to the same physical page because that functionality is quite
special, just like rawio is quite special in requiring people to use
hardblocksize aligned buffers. And yes, we could also allow people to do
rawio without that userspace alignment constraint but with that constraint
we force them to do zero copy.

I'm not sure which are those apps but if we need we can easily handle that case
by browsing backwards the maplist in the TryLockPage == 1 slow path.

Yep, that looks ok.

Replacing the get_user/put_user with handle_mm_fault _after_ changing
follow_page to check the dirty bit too in the write case should be ok.
If you want I can do this change plus the backwards maplist check for allowing
mapping the same physical page multiple times in a kiobuf (the unmap_kiobuf
will unlock the same physical page multiple times but that's ok).

access_one_page is missing the pagetable lock too, but that seems the only
problem. I'm not convinced mixing the internal of access_one_page and
map_user_kiobuf is a good thing since they needs to do a very different thing
in the critical section.
