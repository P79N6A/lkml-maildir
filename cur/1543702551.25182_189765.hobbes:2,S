I would argue even stronger: allowing the administrator to umount
directories manually is a hard requirement.  This means that partial
hierarchies *will* occur.  Thus, relying on the hierarchy being
atomically destructed in inherently broken.
This means that constructing the hierarchy with direct-mount automount
triggers in between the filesystems is mandatory; you get lazy mounting
for free, then -- it's a userspace policy decision whether or not to
release the waiting processes before the hierarchy is complete or not.
Now, once you recognize that the administrator needs to be able to do
umounts, expiry in userspace becomes quite trivial, since expiry is
inherently probabilistic: it can simply mimic an administrator preening
the trees, and if it fails, stop (or re-mount the submounts, policy
decision.)  Having a simple kernel-assist to avoid needless umount
operations is a good thing if (and only if!) it's cheap, but it doesn't
have to be foolproof.
Again, the atomicity constraint that umounting a filesystem needs to
destroy the mount traps above it derives from the need to cleanly deal
with nonatomic destruction.

You probably don't want to do that -- you could end up with some really
odd timing-related bugs if you then re-mount the filesystem.  It's also
unnecessary, since expiry is not a triggered event and therefore doesn't
keep anything that needs to happen from happening.
