Hi *,
On my 64MB notebook I get the following message, when going swsusp:
..
swsusp: Need to copy 15526 pages
swsusp: Not enough free memory
Error -12 suspending
..
# free
             total     used     free   shared    buffers   cached
Mem:         62760    59884     2876        0       3828    16052
-/+ buffers/cache:    40004    22756
Swap:       200804    30316   170488
If I end all apps but the XServer it works. I've allready added some
more swapspace, but that didn't help. So, how much memory will I need
for a successful suspend or better (since i can't stuff any more into 
it) is there a way to minimize the amount needed?
