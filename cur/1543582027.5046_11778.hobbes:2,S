Well, the situation is improving, I suppose ...
Under kernel 2.4.0 and 2.4.1, a dd of about 10000 4k blocks would cause
the system to go technicolor and lock up.
Now, under 2.4.1-ac13, at about 11000 blocks, it goes technicolor, but
doesn't lock up until somewhere between 13000 and 20000.
*wry shrug*
