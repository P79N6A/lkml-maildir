The Gimp has this problem with GIF compression.  I believe the feature
is disabled by default.
My plan is to get V42bis, V90 and the others in there, disabled by
default.  It is up to the user to determine if they are permitted to use
these features, or to obtain the necessary patent licenses.
You must say "I bought a modem and it claims K56 and V.90 support, so I
am permitted to use the --enable-k56 --enable-v90 flags".
We must rely on users to be ethical about how they use the software.
I will not be dictating those ethics.
