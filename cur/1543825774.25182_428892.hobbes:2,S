I'll be working with Tony on a lot of the fbdev side of things. Hopefully we 
won't run into problems providing for backwards compatability.

I've been talking with Tony and this seems to be the direction he'd like to 
take the Kernel. While I'd like to keep the full complement of fbdev drivers 
in the kernel for the embedded people to use (or not) as they please, this 
might not be a good idea.

I was thinking that the dri? nodes could redirect fb specific IOCTL's 
internally and still maintain the two device nodes. This is actually part of 
not breaking anything, since a lot of legacy apps will look for the dri* or 
fb* nodes.
And yes, providing a device per head is something that needs to happen, if 
just to make things like a multi-head Radeon easier to configure and bring up 
both heads on under X.
As to having seperate devices per user - the only cases this would be really 
required are:
1) Multiple users logged onto different VT's
2) Remote users doing server-side acceleration of graphics
For #1 there is no need for seperate devices, since both users are using the 
same display and input methods (unless configured different - say with 
multiple heads and input devices, in which case the second head would already 
have a node available for it).
For #2 I have no real solution. Personally I think that most of the drawing 
commands that can be accelerated should be left to the remote client. As far 
as a remote client wanting sever side rendering and acceleration... This can 
use the same device node and a seperate rendering buffer.The driver itself 
*should* be able to handle accelerating offscreen and oinscreen rendering at 
the same time.
