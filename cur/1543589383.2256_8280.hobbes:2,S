You can look at the kernel boot messages for a line like:
scsi0 : Adaptec AIC7XXX EISA/VLB/PCI SCSI HBA DRIVER, Rev 6.1.12
After boot, you car look at them with 'dmesg'.
And you can also do a 'head -1 /proc/scsi/aic7xxx/*'

Yes, vanilla 2.4.4 uses 6.1.5.

No, i was answering what you quoted, did not see the original message.
The 6.1.11 driver solved problems about the 'abort' messages. Dunno
about the build. I use the driver but built-in.
