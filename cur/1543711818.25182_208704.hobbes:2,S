(Reported to Ingo Molnar who told me to send it here too.)
I've just put a new computer together with an AMD Athlon 64 3200+ and a
Chaintech ZNF3-150 motherboard.  This has the Nvidia NForce 3 chipset.
Booting 2.6.4, from the debian kernel-image-2.6.4-1-k7 package, I get
reproducible errors from the onboard BCM5788 NIC and a Realtek 8139 NIC
when under load.
When the disk is under load, I get reproducible DMA errors from any IDE
disk that is under load.
When I boot with "noapic", these problems go away.
I'm happy to help debug this any way necessary.
Thanks,
Doug.
