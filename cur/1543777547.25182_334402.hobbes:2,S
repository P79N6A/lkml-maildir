Sorry. I thought it was a generic cleanup function and since nothing was
allocated in the register function I didn't think it needed to do
anything. I tried to find some documentation about how classes were
handled but eventually had to resort to looking at other code. Perhaps I
should look at the documentation about kernel objects instead?

The name field cannot be initialised since it isn't generated until
registration. And I avoided filling in the other stuff at allocation so
that I could keep knowledge of mmc_host_class in mmc_sysfs.c.

With the remove function you mean the .release in the class struct?

I'll read up on kernel objects and sysfs and put together a new patch then.
