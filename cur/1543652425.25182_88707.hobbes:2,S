I will have to take a look next time a snapshot is uploaded.  bk and I have
not yet become friends.

Hmm. I wonder what is doing that.  Do you have the semaphore problem on a normal reboot?

Yep it works until it runs into your apics that are not shutdown.
That looks like one of the next things to tackle.

That is what my test machine said as well.  But the confirmation is nice. 
And it definitely means I uploaded a working sample user space.

The .47 version is pretty much just a forward port.  It is uploaded now.
My apologies for not getting to it earlier.
The challenge is with the apic shutdown is that currently the apics are not
in the device tree so that needs to happen before I can submit a good version
for 2.5.x

I would not worry about it to much.  I'm just happy my tools are good enough
that with a little thinking I can figure out what the problem is.
Getting there was hard.
