I changed the values when:
- I've checked what seemed right, getting back to the system call.
  drm_ioctl(), through a call to func().
  That's the case for:
  - the EFAULT value in i915_emit_box
  - two EINVAL values in drm_setversion
- the return value wasn't used. That was the case for
  drm_set_busid return values, I felt having returned values negative
  from the start was more consistent.
Is there a particular change that looked suspicious to you?
Thanks,
Frederik
