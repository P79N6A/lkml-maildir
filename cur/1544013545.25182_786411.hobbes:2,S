No, I didn't realise I had to do that...in fact I didn't even realise SATA 
disks *had* write caches, I thought the cache was for reading only...

Will do, thanks for the advice!  Is there any standard way to disable write 
caching on a SATA disk?  hdparm -W seems to do the trick, but then I can't run 
that until the system is up and running, leaving a small window of opportunity 
for something to go wrong.
Thanks again,
Adam.
