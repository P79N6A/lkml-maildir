Hello
Brief description of the problem: airo driver (Aironet 350 card) works
with 2.5.6 and doesn't work with 2.4.13 on a StrongARM (Trizeps) board.
Details: Loading the modules (airo.o and airo_cs.o) works fine, the
packets get transmitted, ping host&; tcpdump host host shows packets
transmitted and received, but ping reports all packets lost. Same if I
ping the board - tcpdump only sees packets received, none are transmitted.
In /var/log/messages the IO-address, reported by airo looks like a PC
(ix86) address - 0xf6000000-0xf600003f. With 2.5.6 everything works and
the address-range is 0xc2872000-0xc287203f. Any ideas?
Thanks
Guennadi
