Let me be a little blunt here: that is just so much bullshit.
Yes, I understand the problem that 32-bit userspace on a 64-bit kernel has.
Mea culpa - I didn't forsee this years ago, and none of my many reviewers
caught it either.  It was designed for 32/32 and 64/64, not 32/64.
However, this is trivially fixed by adding a union to the structure, as
pointed out earlier on this list.  Code would still be source compatible
with any kqueue apps, which is what counts.  Even NetBSD and FreeBSD have
differing definitions of the kq constants, and nobody notices.
I really have no stake in this matter, so if you want to go invent a 
better mousetrap, more power to you.  But don't claim that "kqueue can
not be used on Linux"; this just makes you look foolish - I have code
running on x86_64 that trivially disproves your statement.
