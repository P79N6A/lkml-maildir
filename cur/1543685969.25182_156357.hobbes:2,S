	yes, this is what I want to use.
About the 07c4:a109 CF+SM Apacer LC1 reader:
I just checked status in 2.4.21.
The CF half words if you select CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_DATAFAB.
The SM hals works is you select CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_SDDR55
and apply a tiny patch to unusual devices:
diff -u --recursive --new-file -X /linux/dontdiff a/drivers/usb/storage/unusual_devs.h b/drivers/usb/storage/unusual_devs.h

[Note: the vanilla kernel setup still does not handle
composite devices like these - you need the twoluns
setup from the URL I gave if you want to use both CF and SM.
But if you are satisfied with having one, then you have it.]
[Note: if you select both CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_DATAFAB and
CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_SDDR55 then the order of the items in
unusual_devs.h will determine which is found first, so
whether you get CF or SM. That is why I put the entry "too early"
in the above.]
