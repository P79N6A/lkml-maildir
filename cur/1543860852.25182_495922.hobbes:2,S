Yes I "get it", thank you.  I don't see it as an insurmountable
problem though, even if it exists at all.

Yes.

Nothing _precludes_ doing that of course.  And it is good
to have an in-kernel tree obviously, you pretty much need
one to make the connection between the OF device tree and
the kernel notion of devices.  I'm just saying that you
shouldn't consider the kernel copy the "master", unless of
course you killed OF.

On more events than just hot-plug, but yes.  Now consider the
consequences: no part of the kernel can hang on to a reference
to a property, or a device node, while any such event can happen
(at least if it requires the data in there to still be valid ;-) )
This means that anything that uses the device tree always should
go over some accessor functions and get all the info they need
at once, not wait until later.

Heh.  I guess I look at the problem more from the OF side, and
you more from the SPARC kernel side, and Ben of course more from
the PowerPC kernel side.  That doesn't make me a "dissenter", we
all have (mostly) the same goal in the end.
