Hi
I was wondering if the patch for sata_nv to hanlde the lost interrupts
has been submitted for inclussion in the kernel.
I have sort of been  following this thread, were it seems that the
interrupt problem has been fixed, but they were also going to fix the
adma problem as well.
I did a quick check of 2.6.16 changelog and see no mention for sata_nv.
I seem to suffere from this issue quite often - doing dvd burns across a
network.....
Thanks
