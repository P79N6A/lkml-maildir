I realize that assembly is platform-specific. Being that I use the IA32 class
machine, that's what I would write for. Others who use other platforms could
do the deed for their native language. As for the algorithm, I'm sure that
whatever method is used to handle page swapping, it has to comply with
the kernel's memory management scheme already in place. That's why I would
need the details so that I wouldn't create more problems than already present.
Being that most users are on the IA32 platform, I'm sure they wouldn't reject
an assembly solution to this problem. As for kernel acceptance, that's an
issue for the political eggheads. Not my forte. :-)
