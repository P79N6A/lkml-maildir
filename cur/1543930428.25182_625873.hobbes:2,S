I *do* have CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ set.  Anyone care to bet whether my
machine starts working again if I disable it?  Sheesh...  The "kernel
alignment issue" theory is making sense...  We change the size of an
initialized variable with the patch, and the problem shows up.  We
shift starting addresses a different way by tweaking kernel options,
and two wrongs make a right?  I've seen it happen, and tracking this
down isn't going to be easy.  Anyone want to wade through the different
System.map files and hazard a guess where we're leaving the rails?
Here's a very brief diff excerpt between the System.map files corresponding
to "sysctl_check patch reverted" (the -dirty version) and "with sysctl_check patch".
At least they agree up to line 10870 :-) ...

I don't get the errors that Michael is seeing, and udevtrigger seems to
be exiting without errors (return code 0).  The last part is the same:
the missing /dev/* entries do not appear.
