Thanks.  I put the dmesg-diff up at 
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/3.txt.
 
That's 2.6.19-rc4 -> 2.6.19-rc4-mm2.
The relevant bits are here:
 libata version 2.00 loaded.
 ahci 0000:00:1f.2: version 2.0
 ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:1f.2[B] -> GSI 17 (level, low) -> IRQ 18
-ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:00:1f.2 disabled
-ahci: probe of 0000:00:1f.2 failed with error -12
-ata_piix 0000:00:1f.2: version 2.00ac6
+PCI: Unable to reserve I/O region #1:8@1f0 for device 0000:00:1f.2
+ahci: probe of 0000:00:1f.2 failed with error -16
+ata_piix 0000:00:1f.2: version 2.00ac7
 So previously ahci failed with -ENOMEM and in -mm2 it failed with EBUSY. 
 because in -mm2 AHCI wasn't able to reserve an IO region.  I don't know
 why this changed.
 And there's no indication what it it conflicting _with_.  Perhaps piix,
 but piix doesn't appear to have started up yet.
 Greg, perhaps when we get a resource reservation conflict we should print
 what it's conflicting _with_?  Optionally, at least - via a kernel boot
 parameter.
 ata_piix 0000:00:1f.2: MAP [ P0 P2 IDE IDE ]
-PCI: Enabling device 0000:00:1f.2 (0000 -> 0001)

-ata: 0x170 IDE port busy
-ata: conflict with ide1

-ata1: SATA max UDMA/133 cmd 0x1F0 ctl 0x3F6 bmdma 0xBFA0 irq 14

-ata1.00: ata1: dev 0 multi count 8
-ata1.00: applying bridge limits
-ata1.00: configured for UDMA/100
-scsi1 : ata_piix
 So in -rc4 ata-piix was kinda-happy, although that "conflict with ide1"
 is a bit ugly.
 What is this warning telling us?

 And here piix failed because it cannot grab the IO regions.
I dunno.
It _looks_ like one of the various IDE/PATA/SATA drivers is getting in the
way of another one.  But why is this happening in rc4-mm2 and not in -rc4?
I'd suggest that you experiment with the .config: disable ahci for a start.
 Also try disabling the IDE driver.  Maybe try disabling CONFIG_PATA_MPIIX
too.
