Oh, _llc_ references/misses? Ouch.
You have, what 32K L1I, 32K L1D, and 4MB L2? And even this microbenchmark
is seeing increased L2 misses by nearly 3%. Hmm, I wonder where that is
coming from? Instruction fetches?
It would be interesting to see how "the oltp" benchmark fares with
CONFIG_PARAVIRT turned on. That workload lives and dies by the cache :)
