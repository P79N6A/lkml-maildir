Agreed. However, I think the easier solution is to move the
"mark_buffer_clean()" code into the early write case (search for the
comment "Hmmph! Nothing to write" ;)

We can. We have to do it _before_ rather than later, though - just in case
we race with somebody else marking it dirty (it's ok to do the IO twice,
but it's not ok to not do it at all).

Oops, right you are, I was going to change the rules but ended up
reverting those changes (except for this one case I missed). Thanks,
