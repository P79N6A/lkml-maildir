No, rsync uses a much weaker hash.  The paper on the rsync alg is
interesting and has all the details, so you should read if if you
want to be sure.  But from my memory rsync uses a combination of
a weak 16 bit hash which it rolls through the data, and a strong
32 bit hash which it uses to check the 16 bit hash.
