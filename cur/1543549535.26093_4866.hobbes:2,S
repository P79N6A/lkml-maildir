Thanx for the answer.

Oh, now I see why I found so many references to 
remap_page_range() in sound cards code. But there is still 
something that seems odd to me:
1) Why using the remap_page_range() to perform the mmap() of 
/dev/mem ?
In this way, as I happened to find out, you can mmap() only the 
reserved pages of physical memory, when theoretically /dev/mem 
should grant you access to the whole physical memory in the 
system; and performing a read() or write() system call on /dev/mem 
affects even non-reserved pages (I tested the read(), and the code 
of write() seems to me to behave in the same way).
Is there any theoretical reason that suggests that mmap() should 
not be able to read pages accessible with read() and write()?
2) Wouldn't it be a good idea to change the comment about the 
remap_page_range()? It states:
> maps a range of physical memory into the requested pages. the
> old mappings are removed. any references to nonexistent pages
> results in null mappings (currently treated as "copy-on-access")
There is no reference to the fact that only the reserved pages in 
physical memory can be mapped. No mention of I/O addresses is 
present, as well. And no mention that references to non-reserved 
physical pages will result in null mappings.
just my 2c, of course.
