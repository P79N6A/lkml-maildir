2.3.24 fails the same way as 2.3.23, it immediately reboots after
displaying "ok, now booting the kernel"

I've upgraded binutils since 2.3.23.
This is an Intel Pentium 233MMX on an Abit AX5 with 64M ram. All power
management feature are turned off in the BIOS. I've successfully run
development kernels up to 2.3.22 (which died a horrible death at
shutdown).
