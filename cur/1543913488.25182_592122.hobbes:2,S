Not only that. With x?x:z, x is evaluated twice,
while with x?:z, x is only evaluated once. That's for stuff when you 
want to, say [dumb example follows],
size_t my_read(..) {
    return read(..) ? : -1
}
and the only other way would be to use a temporary,
size_t my_read(..) {
	size_t x = read(..);
	return x ? x : -1;
}
gcc should be smart enough to also do optimization in the second case..
