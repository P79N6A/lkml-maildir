i tend to be of the opinion that the details in C source code should be 
visually obvious and should be heavily simplified down from what is 
'possible' language-wise - with most deviations and complications that 
depart from convention considered an error. I'd consider "!fn1() & 
!fn2()" a borderline coding style violation in any case - and it costs 
nothing to change it to "!fn1() && !fn2()".
