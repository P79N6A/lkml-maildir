From experience, DOS varies in the interleave it uses depending on the
type of drive, the capacity of the disk, and whether it's a generic or
OEM release.
I've met all of the following:
 1. Interleave 4 with Compaq OEM releases, and with 5.25" 1200k
    drives formatting 720k floppies.
 2. Interleave 3 with 5.25" 1200k drives formatting 360k or 1200k
    floppies, and with 1440k 3.5" drives formatting 1440k floppies.
 3. Interleave 2 with 5.25" 720k or 1200k drives formatting 720k
    (80 track 9 sector) floppies, and with 3.5" drives formatting
    720k floppies.
 4. Interleave 1 with 2880k 3.5" drives formatting 1440k or 2880k
    floppies.
Note especially the last one - it means that 1440k floppies formatted
on a 2880k drive are considerably slower to read in a 1440k drive than
the same disk formatted in a 1440k drive.
However, with that exception, Dos doesn't use an interleave of 1, as
you state.
Best wishes from Riley.
