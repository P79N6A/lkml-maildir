You have a very strange 2.6.17 kernel there. The include/linux/sched.h is so 
incompatible that the patching (with fuzz) places "unsigned char fpu_counter;" 
in a totally unrelated struct, and not in "struct task_struct  {".
Here's a working rebase of that part - sorry about mangling by this webmail 
client... Btw, the whole thing has no measurable effect on real world stuff 
like rendering through blender - on my machine, at least.
