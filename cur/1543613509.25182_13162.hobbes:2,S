yes, it's a valid configuration. Eg. distribution makers are frequently
using highmem-enabled kernels - and it's a natural thing that they boot &
work just fine on non-highmem boxes as well. Also, even a highmem box
could have a RAM failure anytime that forces a temporary removal of RAM,
causing the box to have no highmem RAM anymore, in which situation it
would be pretty awkward if the highmem-enabled kernel failed.
