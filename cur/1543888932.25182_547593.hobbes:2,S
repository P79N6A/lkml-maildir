Unfortunately, it doesn't :(
I tried this on one of our internal drivers, which is based on FC 3 (or
4, can look this up). With s390 defconfig, it is unable to open the
root device /dev/dasda1 (which is unsurprising, considering udev (063)
decided to create /dev/dasda(1) as a character node instead of a block
node). The only udev rule I found which could affect the dasd device
nodes is
SUBSYSTEM=="block",             GROUP="disk", MODE="0640"
When I look at the system, /sys/block/ and /sys/class/block/ look sane
at first glance (working on a 3270 console is usally PITA...)
Even more surprisingly, the system comes up fine (once I added ptmx to
makedev.d/) with CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED not set. /sys/block/
and /sys/class/block/ look just like expected. (Unfortunately, our
lsdasd tool breaks with this...)
I'll see if I can find out more.
