No. You cannot test for SMM. Full stop. That's the whole _point_ of SMM. 
It's hidden away.
Why do you care? If you have a machine with this problem, just use the
"lapic" command line. We do NOT default to unsafe values.

We don't punish good hardware.
We punish _bad_ hardware. The kind of hardware that has a BIOS that has 
disabled the local APIC. 
Try to get your BIOS updated if you want to consider your hardware "good". 
And if the hw vendor doesn't have a fixed BIOS, then don't call it good, 
and use "lapic".
