Hi, I'm trying to compile the Kernel 0.0.1 on my Slackware 7 machine (I
know it's a little bit old, but for a little research at school is
alright) and when I type 'make' the system returns the following:
as -c -o boot/head.o boot/head.s
as: unrecognized option `-c'
make: *** [boot/head.o] Error 1
Is there any way to compile this kernel without MINIX? Can you suggest
another version to me?
Sorry for this stupid question, I'm a newbie on this... Thanks for all
Hector Facundo Arena
