With your kernel config and my lguest+busybox setup, I get:
SLUB:

SLOB with two lists:

MemFree:         24260 kB
MemFree:         24260 kB

Not sure why this result is so different from yours.
Hacked this up to three lists to experiment and we now have:
MemFree:         24348 kB
MemFree:         24372 kB
MemFree:         24372 kB
MemFree:         24372 kB
MemFree:         24372 kB
MemFree:         24380 kB
MemFree:         24384 kB
MemFree:         24404 kB
MemFree:         24404 kB
MemFree:         24408 kB
avg:             24344.4
Even the last version is still using about 250 pages of storage for 209
pages of data, so it's got about 20% overhead still.
