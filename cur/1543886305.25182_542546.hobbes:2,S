working 3D/DRI intel-agp.ko resume for i815 chip cleanup patch:
- revert register define name change to ease backporting etc.
- shorten resume issues warning message to two lines while still preserving
  all required information (use many shorter words)
I'm not ultimately sure about the register define names, since there's
a general inconsistency in naming here which perhaps would be a good idea
to resolve (my original renaming happened to decrease inconsistency but didn't
quite get rid of it, so it was kind of useless to do it...).
The warning message, while definitely ugly (and that's its job ;), IMHO is
very important to make knowledgeable people see where the problem is.
Those people, if they experience issues, WILL look at kernel logs...
Splitting the remember_state function in two parts isn't very useful given
that it's supposed to be a temporary, "make it work at all" measure only
until there's generic save/restore support (I want to keep this "debug"
code at a minimum). Once there's further chipset data and/or information
how to implement this cleanly, I'm definitely interested in continuing that.
Run-tested on 2.6.21-mm2, resumes fine.
