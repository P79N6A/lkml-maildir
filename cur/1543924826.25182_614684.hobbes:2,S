The old setup.S had that 16-byte jump in there.
We actually goofed when we added the relocatable bzImage support and
moved the 16bit jump.

I have a hard time believing in discipline when I see the amount of
not invented here and various oddball mistakes (cause by overlooking
things) that seems to go on when extending the format.  We never
needed to change the way the command line was passed, and we should
have kept the longer jump where we had it.
If we are going to through and add an additional pointer to a notes section
let's please put a jump in there so we can make the header longer as
we choose.
Pointers really, really, really suck for maintenance of binary formats.
Offsets against a known base are better, but better still is if you can
avoid them entirely.  For what we are doing allocating a contiguous piece
of memory or file is not at all unreasonable.
