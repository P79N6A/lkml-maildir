They never wake up, and it happens every time.

As I said above, it happens every time we encounter this, ie. it's a bug
that easy to reproduce (since I added nfs@lists.sourceforge.net to the
CC-list, I'm going to write some of what's already said in this thread).
Problem:
Processes entering D-state is unkillable. We have a problem with this 
everytime we restart autofs (which automounts quite a few NFS-shares
on campus), ie. on our samba-boxes smbd hangs forever after this
(in D-state). Samba still works, it's just that all the D-state processes
is unkillable and will remain that way untill we reboot the computer.
Every D-state process increases the load on the machine, and one of our
2-CPU intel-boxes currently remains at 430 (which extremly high for such
a box).
Solution:
? :)
