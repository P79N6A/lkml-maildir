Nah...don't think it's only Cyrix-related. It might be some unlucky hardware
configuration.
I've been running Linux on my 6x86 P166+ since RedHat 5.0 with no problem at
all...
Compiled 2.2.2 here the other day....still no prob.....
But that damn Diamond Netcommander ISDN/EC card won't run under
Linux...2.2.2 Plug'n Play-detected it, but there is no driver for this card.
The card has an exactly identical chipset as the SkyRacer NC card from
Acotec GmbH.
Is there ANYONE who might be able to help me out here....I will take on an
unofficial/developer driver for testing if it exists...
Please Please...

It sounds as if Redhat is doing something screwy with your system, perhaps
as part of their hardware detection programs.  If it was the kernel I'd
suspect you wouldn't even get to the second level setup message.  Try out a
Slackware boot/root disk combo.  (available at
ftp.cdrom.com/pub/linux/slackware-3.6)  The boot disk bare.i should work for
your system if you are using IDE.  If this disk combo works then you could
take the kernel off that boot floppy.  If it still doesn't work then its a
Redhat problem, try a different distribution.
