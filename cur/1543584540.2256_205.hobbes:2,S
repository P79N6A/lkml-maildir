I don't see any other way how the ZIP could have impact on the IDE HDD
on a different IDE interface.
If you wonder why /proc/ide/via reports slower DMA rates for the HDD
when the ZIP is connected is because the auto slowdown code kicks in and
lowers the transfer rate when too many CRC errors happen.
