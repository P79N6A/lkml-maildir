I'm not on this list, followups set to my email address.
Trying to compile 2.4.5 with gcc-3.0 gives me this:
,----
| gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.4.5/include -Wall \
|   -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer \
|   -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe \
|   -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=athlon \
|   -c -o timer.o timer.c
| 
| timer.c:35: conflicting types for `xtime'
| 
| /usr/src/linux-2.4.5/include/linux/sched.h:540: \
|   previous declaration of `xtime'
| 
| make[2]: *** [timer.o] Error 1
| make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.5/kernel'
| make[1]: *** [first_rule] Error 2
| make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.5/kernel'
| make: *** [_dir_kernel] Error 2
`----
Has anyone else seen this?  Is it a problem with the kernel or gcc?
Have I just stuffed up the gcc installation?
I don't see this with gcc-2.95.2
Thanks very much for any light you can shed of this for me.
