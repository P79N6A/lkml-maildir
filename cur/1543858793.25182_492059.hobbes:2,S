I saw Val at OSDI right before this HotDep talk and sure, I have seen the
paper :-)

I also have this feeling.  RAIF0 is similar to chunkfs and allows more
flexibility.  Not only RAIF can stripe the data on many small local file
systems (possibly located on multiple drives) but also can stripe the data
on remote file systems.  In addition, it can keep the parity, use
per-file-type storage policies etc.  However, such a configuration would
mean lots and lots of lower file systems ( = branches = chunks).  I am
afraid that in this case RAIF's performance would be not so great due to
VFS API restrictions for operations like lookup.
