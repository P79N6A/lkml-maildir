Hi Roger and all.
RAO> Oh, and just in case someone tries to compile with my config; to get the

I have same problem with it. Somebody miss this fact when striped out
snd prefix in this driver. I've send patch to kernel list, but it was
skiped.
But with solving this problem you don't have CSP enabled because it's
disabled by default and you must use bootparams to enable it:
#ifdef CONFIG_SND_SB16_CSP
static int csp[SNDRV_CARDS] = {[0 ... (SNDRV_CARDS - 1)] = 0};
#endif
Here is my TRIVIAL patch.
