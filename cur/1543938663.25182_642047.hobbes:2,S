In this case the problem is that drivers ask for different caching mode
on overlapping IO mappings. That only gets resolved by the underlying
MTRRs, but PAT aware code has to fail.

That's true, but the problem is that they give different conflicting 
requests (cached and uncached).

Well if they ask for conflicting requirements what can you do?

Does it?

ioremap as an ABI is robust I believe, but still it has some basic 
requirements like nobody passing in conflicting requests.
Are you saying the underlying ioremap() interface should silently
change the caching mode if the driver passes in a conflicting one?
I have my doubts that would be a good strategy. Better probably 
to fail and complain and fix the drivers after some code review.

Point of that being? I added a separate stress tester instead
that actually tests far more cases and actually verifies that it 
works.
My take is rather that with my changes DEBUG_PAGEALLOC is significantly
cheaper than it was before (e.g. it runs lockless now) so actually
more people can use it for debugging.
And after all we have millions of lines of code who can benefit
from DEBUG_PAGEALLOC and will benefit from it being cheaper, while cpa 
is just a few hundred lines of code that we will hopefully eventually
get right anyways.
