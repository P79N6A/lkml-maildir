Prebuilt for Ubuntu 7.04:
http://landley.net/code/firmware/downloads/cross-compiler/host-i686/cross-compiler-sparc.tar.bz2
Source code:
Or 
http://landley.net/code/firmware/downloads/firmware-0.2.2.tar.bz2
For the second one, extract it, cd into it, "./build.sh sparc", and when it 
finishes your sparc-gcc should be in "build/cross-compiler-sparc/bin".
You can move the cross-compiler-sparc directory anywhere you want in the 
filesystem, and it should still work.  Just add the "bin" subdirectory of it 
to $PATH and CROSS_COMPILE=sparc-
