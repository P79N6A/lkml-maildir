But I said we DO want to use FS operations. Just nowhere near as often
as we want to treat the data streaming through the file system (i.e.
"strawman"), so the speed of metadata operations on the FS is not
apparently an issue.

My experiments with the current lvm have convinced me that it is a
horror show with no way sometimes of rediscovering its own consistent
state even on one node. I'd personally prefer there to be no lvm, right
now!

The point is not to choose a file system, but to be able to use
whichever one is preferable _at the time_. This is important.
Different FSs have different properties, and if one is 10% faster than
another for a different data load, then the faster FS can be put
in and 10% more data can be collected in the time slot allocated (and
these time slots cost "the earth" :-).
