And there is the root exploit found by Coverity this week too:
http://news.yahoo.com/s/zd/20060502/tc_zd/177195
X is multiple megabytes of code needlessly running as root. If we
could convince X to use device drivers to talk to the hardware it
wouldn't need to run as root.  This is part of why I am against this
patch, it is another crutch to let X keep on running as root instead
of fixing the underlying problem.
