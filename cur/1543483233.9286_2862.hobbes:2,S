OK.  It seems that a prominant companies field rep has read some of the
linux FUD and believed it:
> My limited understanding of Linux is:
> 
> A.	The kernel doesn't implement kernel-mode threads.  
> B.	With Linux, the scheduler can't preempt the kernel, which is
> needed for the scheduler to divide CPU time among the threads.  
> C.	Lastly, with Linux, the kernel is not reentrant.  In other
> words, no matter how many processors are in a system, only one processor 
> can execute code at a time.
I know that these are certainly not true for 2.2.X.  I seem to remember
that there was a nice rebuttal of these points posted somewhere, anyone
remember where?
