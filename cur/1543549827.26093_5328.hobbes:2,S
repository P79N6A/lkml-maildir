Hi,
  2.4.0-test9-pre6 just blew on me :-( OOps typed by hand...
I have no idea how CPUs are numbered now, but couple of months ago
they were numbered CPU0 and CPU1 ;-) I have only two CPUs...

Ideas? I'm under impression that it happened to me already on friday
with 2.4.0-test9-pre5, but as it was in the middle of some presentation,
I had no time to write oops down (for sure some NMI watchdog... occured, but
I'm not sure that this one).
At time of oops I was reading 'fbtv' manpage...
