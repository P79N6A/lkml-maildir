Here are the ARM results:
Requested PROT | ---    R--    -W-    RW-    --X    R-X    -WX    RWX
========================================================================
MAP_SHARED     | ---    r-x    !w!    rwx    r-x    r-x    rwx    rwx
MAP_PRIVATE    | ---    r-x    !w!    rwx    r-x    r-x    rwx    rwx
As expected, the same as x86 since we have the same situation there -
we can not represent the write-only page permission in hardware.
