ethtool has been made current with kernel 2.4.15/2.5.0.
Only the natsemi driver in the kernel fully supports all capabilities at
this time, but patches are available in gkernel cvs to implement ethtool
support in many more drivers.
Kudos to Tim Hockin @ Sun for most of the implementation work, both in
natsemi and in userspace ethtool.
