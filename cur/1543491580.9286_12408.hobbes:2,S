All all `Sun NFS Emulation' switch does is let you look in
directories using NFS that have a filesystem mounted on the
on the local machine.   You mount /tmp from a different
filesystem than /.  If you export / and then mount / on /mnt
if you do ls /mnt/tmp and have Sun NFS Emulation off you
will see nothing where if you have Sun NFS Emulation on you
will see any file that are in the tmp directory on the /
filesystem.

P.S. Do you have portmap running?
