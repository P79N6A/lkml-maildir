I was only pointing out a corner case where your argument doesn't
hold. I completely agree that it is rather unlikely to happen with
real world data.
There is one exception, though: data that has already been compressed
before on a higher level; by the user, for example. However, in
that case you could say that what you're trying to accomplish has already
happened before during the original compression run.
