I tested this patch, and it works.
But I was not seeing any problems before the patch,
other than the 'sleeping in illegal context message'
There seems to be agreement that the cause of the
message is that individual PCMCIA drivers need to be
modified to call the release function directly
instead of from a timer context.
I modified my synclink_cs driver to do this and it
works and eliminates the error message.
Which brings up a question:
The include/pcmcia/ds.h file defines the dev_link_t
structure that contains the release timer_list member.
Should I continue to initialize this member in
my driver or will this member be eliminated requiring
that all references to this member be removed from
the individual PCMCIA drivers?
