Hi!
I'm having awfull interactivity problems. While lingvistic application
(slm from nltools.sf.net) is running, machine is unusable. I still can
read text in most, but can't login, can't run links, can't... For
minutes.
slm does a lot of computation over ~250MB dataset, but during stall
disk was not active.
