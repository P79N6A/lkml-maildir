I like to see this.

Actually most chips I encounter these days already have 128KiB.  And
some people seem to do some kind of raid-0 in the drivers to increase
bandwidth.  FS-visible blocksize is also increased by that.

Bummer.  Can this change in the future?

"only 1 Gig" :)
With my LogFS hat on, I don't care too much whether data is cached in
terms of pages or blocks.  What matters to me most is to get fed
blocksize chunk on writeback and be able to read blocksize'd chunks.
Compressing 64KiB at a time gives somewhere around 10% (don't remember
exact number) better compression when compared to 4KiB.  JFFS2 can
benefit from this as well.
That should also be sufficient for cross-platform compatibility,
shouldn't it?
Better performance for the pagecache is also nice to have, no doubt.
But if system stability remains an issue, I'd rather keep slow and
stable.
