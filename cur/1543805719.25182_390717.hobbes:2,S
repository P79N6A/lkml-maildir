What cruft? This?
# grep -r WIRELESS_EXT .
./pci.c:                ndev->name, WIRELESS_EXT, UTS_RELEASE);
./common.c:             "Wireless extension version:\t" STRING(WIRELESS_EXT) "\n"
./acx_struct.h:#ifdef WIRELESS_EXT
./acx_struct.h:#if WIRELESS_EXT > 15
./ioctl.c:      range->we_version_compiled = WIRELESS_EXT;
I consider this to be a really modest amount of compat code
which makes driver users happy (that fraction of it which is not
willing to run -mm).
However, I would remove even that at Jeff's or Andrew's request,
or without anyone's request if acx will be merged to Linus tree.
