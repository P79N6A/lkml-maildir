I'm not sure that I do, actually.
You seem to be opposed to all static probe markers in general, but I
think that they'd be useful for big abstract things like "new thread
created" (which would encompass fork/vfork/clone and probably consist of
a single marker in do_fork) or for similar things that happen all over
the kernel (for example, I imagine that all filesystems would want to
use the same set of probe names just to make I/O tracing easier for
userspace).
