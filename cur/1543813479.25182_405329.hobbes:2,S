I can no longer trigger it, at least not with the usual procedure.  I
doubt that it goes away (i.e. that it is solved), only that it
slithers into hiding, like bugs that disappear when compiling a C
program with -g but show up when compiling without -g.

Oh, I always have more info turned on in my sleep.sh script
(debug_layer = 0xFFFF3FFF to begin with, and the script sets
debug_level to 0x1F).  I'll attach the slightly trimmed log file to
the bugme report.  If it's too much information, let me know and I'll
retest with just the above settings.
