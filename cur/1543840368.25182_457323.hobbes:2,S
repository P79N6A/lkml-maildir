Sorry about that - my explanation was unclear.
What I was trying to say was that I agreed that revocation was not 
safe, and that we should block any access request that would cause
demotion/promotion if it would also cause revocation. This would
close the revocation hole for malicious code/data.
We could still safely demote/promote processes in the other cases
which would not trigger revocation, and the security model would
be not only safer from the removal of revocation, but would still be
useful, as in practice we found that many/most demotions/promotions do
not have anything to revoke.
