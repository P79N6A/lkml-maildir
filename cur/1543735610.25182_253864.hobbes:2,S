The patchset was against 2.6.8(.1), the rejects come from the janitor 
cleanups for msleep() in the saa7146 driver and from the 
sys_read()/errno mess in the frontend drivers, which loaded the firmware 
directly.

I'll send you a new patchset against 2.6.9-rc2-mm1 in private right now. 
  The patches have been adopted or re-generated to fit against your 
latest tree, so I don't post them in public any more.
