I don't understand enough about the kernel to do this so I'm asking here..
In 2.0.36 when writing to a scsi tape, it would accept all data sizes
(mainly sending the output of gzip to the tape).  In 2.2.1, it'll send all
out except for the last block (which is less than 4096, and I'm assuming
it's not the blocksize that the driver is expecting).
What I'm looking for is a patch that will pad the block being written to the
next higher block size with NULLs.
