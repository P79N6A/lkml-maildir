It sounds as if Redhat is doing something screwy with your system, perhaps
as part of their hardware detection programs.  If it was the kernel I'd
suspect you wouldn't even get to the second level setup message.  Try out a
Slackware boot/root disk combo.  (available at
ftp.cdrom.com/pub/linux/slackware-3.6)  The boot disk bare.i should work for
your system if you are using IDE.  If this disk combo works then you could
take the kernel off that boot floppy.  If it still doesn't work then its a
Redhat problem, try a different distribution.
