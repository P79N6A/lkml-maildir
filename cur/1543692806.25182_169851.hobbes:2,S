Hi there!
I know my machine as a rockstable P4 Computer, since
linux-2.6.0-test5-mm4 it freezes once a day. Not here and then, it
happened after long usage from 17:00 or 18:00 around midnight two times
yesterday and before yesterday. Don't laugh, is it possible that a day
change triggers a bug which freezes system? The second time I looked at
my screens at realized, that I saw this picture the day before: Irssi's
last message was "Day changed to ...". I was in heavy chatting, there
was no message even a second after that. Reading that I would laugh, but
it happened two times...
linux-2.6.0-test5-mm3 and older never freezed.
I have the state dump, catched via serial line at
http://ludenkalle.de/capture-2003-09-30-linux-2.6.0-test5-mm4.log
for who is interested, but the Kernel ist tainted by the nvidia module
:(
But this time it is different. Normally, ehen this module is involved,
sound hangs, but keeps on playing in a half a second long loop.
This times all was silent...
Well, if the tainting is not acceptable tell me even if an clock/time
bug in kernel on day change could cause a complete system freeze :)
