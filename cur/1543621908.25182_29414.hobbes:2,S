Right you are. The 3125000 Hz number does not divide well for the faster
standard rates. Here's where the number came from. The oscillator value on
my 16PCI954 based card is 50.0 MHz, which is not a clean multiple of
anything. The UART is in x16 async clock mode so (without the prescaler) the
highest possible baud rate (divisor = 1) is 50.0 MHz / 16 = 3125000 Hz. 
To get the standard rates above 115.2k with a 50.0 MHz clock, we must use
the 16950's CPR register (prescaler) which supports fractional scale
factors. See today's patch from fabrizio.gennari@philips.com, "[PATCH]
Kernel support for 16C950's CPR register". This is a better solution than
what I was using which was to initialize the CPR to create a more benign
base rate close to 921600 Hz, which is the other number I mentioned.
Thanks for noticing. I had published the version of my serial driver patch
without the CPR register initialization. oops.
