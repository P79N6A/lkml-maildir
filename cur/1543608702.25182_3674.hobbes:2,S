	Hi,
	<I'm not suscribed on the mailing list>
	I've made a patch to the serial driver (and setserial) to
extend support of 16C950 UARTs and enable to use the higher speed of
the Brainboxes Pcmcia BlueTooth card.
	I've sent my patch to Theodore Ts'o and on the sourceforge
mailing list, but it seems that nobody is actively maintaining the
serial driver.
	Well... What next ?
	Have fun...
	Jean
