Subject: [RFC][patch 00/44] Consolidate irq_action flags
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The recent interrupt rework introduced bit value conflicts with sparc.
Instead of introducing new architecture flags mess, move the interrupt
SA_ flags out of the signal namespace and replace them by interrupt
related flags.
This allows to remove the obsolete SA_INTERRUPT flag and clean up
the bit field values.
The patch was mostly created by a script, manually fixed up and reviewed.
Compile tested on various platforms. Boot tested on i386/x86_64
