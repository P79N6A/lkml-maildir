Hmm, I thought I saw those changes in 2.2.1... Maybe I was mistaken.  I
believe I am up to date with eerything. I will check one more time.  I
do not know what it would be then because it is just recently (2.2.x
maybe in pre but not in 2.1.x) that bash stopped working properly.
I will check and report.
