I don't know.

Maybe I've told you before :-)
I also don't like to put bus into the names of those directories,
because I think the names of those directories are used as physical
slot identifier, not logical identifier, and neither PCI-to-PCI
Bridge Architecture spec, PCI Hot-Plug spec, SHPC spec nor PCI
Express spec allow putting bus number into physical slot identifier.
Removing bus number from the names of those directories would fix
the problem in a short term. But I think it is only a band-aid
because all of those specifications allow using chassis number
in the physical slot identifier. If any hotplug driver will put
chassis number into slot names, the same problem will happen.
I think it's the right direction to use combination of chassis and
slot number as a slot name if we try to unify slot names among
drivers, though there will be some challenges as follows.
- how to handle the names of vendor specific hotplug drivers?
- SHPC spec allows vendor specific names, IIRC. how to handle it?
- and so on.

Maybe the reason is very simple. The SHPCHP driver was loaded first,
and then ACPI PCI slot detection driver was loaded. Both are loaded
automatically at boot time. If we changed the order, we would get
another result.
