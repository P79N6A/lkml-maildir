After writing this, I see...
KCONFIG
P:      Roman Zippel
M:      zippel@linux-m68k.org
L:      linux-kbuild@vger.kernel.org
S:      Maintained
[...]
KERNEL BUILD (kbuild: Makefile, scripts/Makefile.*)
P:      Sam Ravnborg
M:      sam@ravnborg.org
T:      git kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sam/kbuild-next.git
T:      git kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sam/kbuild-fixes.git
L:      linux-kbuild@vger.kernel.org
S:      Maintained
