Here's the latest version of my patch to avoid recompiling your kernel when you
add a smart Stallion IO card to your system.
A previous version of this patch went into the kernel about 2.1.90 but was soon
wiped out by a new version from Stallion.  Can someone who is maintaining a CVS
tree (Linus? Alan? Dave?) please include this for 2.2.0?
This patch has been tested quite a bit and works well for my clients.  I would
like to do a patch for the intelligent cards too if someone is willing to test
it for me (I haven't got access to such a card).

 If using EasyIO or EasyConnection 8/32 ISA or MCA boards, do:
-   vi /usr/src/linux/drivers/char/stallion.c
-      - find the definition of the stl_brdconf array (of structures)
-        near the top of the file
-      - modify this to match the boards you are going to install

-      - save and exit
+modprobe stallion brdtype=BOARD io=ADDR secio=ADDR irq=IRQ
+Where BOARD is one of "easyio", "ech", "echmc", and "echpci".  These represent
+EasyIO, EasyConnection, EasyConnection MCA, and EasyConnection PCI (should be
+autodetected and should never be needed as a parameter but included just in
+case of broken hardware).  The "io" and "secio" parameters take the usual port
+address as you'd expect (NB the "secio" can be omitted if your card doesn't
+have a secondary IO address).  The irq is set by this parameter (io addresses
+are set by DIP switches).  Make sure that you use an irq that nothing else
+does.  If you know of a good way of determining a free IRQ from kernel space
+then let me know and I'll make this parameter optional too.
+I'll write a similar patch for the intelligent Stallion cards if someone is
+willing to test it.
