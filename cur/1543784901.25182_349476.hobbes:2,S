Putting in less effort than someone else is hardly an excuse for
anything.  Much less for personal attacks.
Can you please cut it off and offer technical arguments?  Even if the
maintainer had a personal problem with you, technical arguments tend
to win and good code will go in.  Everything else is just mailing list
noise and increased hart rates for some people.
