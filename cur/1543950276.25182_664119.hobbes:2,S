Feel free to start pulling in:
git://git.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net-2.6.26.git#master
I just did a test pull into the current linux-next.
There was one conflict, net/tipc/socket.c, which has been converted
from semaphores to mutexes.  It conflicts with the generic semaphores
change, and essentially you can simply remove the generic semaphore
modifications to this file when you build the next tree since the
net-2.6.26 tree changes these TIPC bits to not use semaphores any
more.
The result builds cleanly allmodconfig on sparc64.
