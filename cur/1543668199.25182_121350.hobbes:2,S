Hi!
Kernels after 2.5.63 don't work well for me.
I get these IDE messages:
hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x24
hda: lost interrupt
hda: dma_intr: bad DMA status (dma_stat=30)
hda: dma_intr: status=0x50 { DriveReady SeekComplete }
regularly (didn't happen with previous kernels) and the scheduler
appears to be unfair now.  As soon as I start one big CPU task (like
mencoder, oggenc or lame), the other tasks rarely if ever get to run at
all.
Felix
