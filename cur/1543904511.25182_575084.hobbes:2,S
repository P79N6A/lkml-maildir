THE STAIR AND THE FAIR
There once was some code
That scheduled all loads
Then came what they call
The staircase that rolled
"But wait", said the fair
who came without flair
Let's see how they play
Then choose who would stay
The staircase seemed naught
But some agreed not
The fair then moved on
As others got drawn
They say life's not fair
But that, you should bear
The challenge, the draw
seemed endless, I saw
But one day, the other
said no more for yonder
So now there is peace
And silence there is
But camps would not rest
'Til they see the best
And what is the best?
The stair or the fair?
I wouldn't just say
Else flames won't abate
You judge by the art
The elegant part
The order, not linear
"But log!" said the fair
The stair, said "one"
"My order is one"
Now both are just one
But someone said "done"
The fair and the stair
An exciting affair!
I hope there is more
Discussions on fore
O, Linux!  Your ways!
Some drool but some praise.
For me, I am simple
I cannot just mingle
But seeing what's there
I read all with care
Lest I be confused
With just what to use
Just what do I use?
I wouldn't dare muse
Please tell me, you'd say
My darling, I pray
That's one for the guess
for he who knows best
