I have a system with a LSI Logic/Symbios Logic 53c810 SCSI device with 
an external Iomega Zip drive and an internal Iomega Jaz drive attached 
both of which appear to be operating normally.  However, I am also 
getting the following message:
Jun 29 13:15:04 mudlark kernel: sd 0:0:6:0: phase change 6-7 9@37caa7a0 
resid=7.
every 2 seconds (approximately).  Does it indicate some hardware problem 
that I should be concerned about or can I ignore it?  If it's just 
informative does it have to be repeated so frequently?
