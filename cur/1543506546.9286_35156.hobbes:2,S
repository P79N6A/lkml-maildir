I have found that diald works fine with pppd 2.3.9.  The problem is that
diald does *not* seem to work with kernel version 2.3.1[34].
pppd 2.3.9 works for me with kernels 2.3.1[14], and diald+pppd 2.3.9
works with 2.2.x, but diald+pppd 2.3.9 with kernels 2.3.1[34] seems to
time out before completing the connection.
This has been tested with diald 0.16 and 0.99.1.
