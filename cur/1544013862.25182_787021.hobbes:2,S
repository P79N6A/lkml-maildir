Careful: This seems to be *exactly* the intent of the
maintainers of the UTC definition: some days really
will have 86401 seconds in them.  That's why there's
all this talk of 'solar time' (see e.g. the wikipedia article)

Now, this is the first proposal that I've heard that makes
sense.  I believe that the Linux kernel/userspace
infrastructure already " accurately models international
timekeeping standards", so we're good.
Changing the kernel to track TAI instead of UTC seems
like an excellent idea -- but not one without a significant
amount of work -- maybe new syscalls are needed, as
well as new monkeying-about in glibc, maybe in ntpd, etc.

Yes, this really does seem like the right solution.

Lets be clear on what "control files" means.  This does
*NOT* mean some config file shipped by some distro
for some package. That would be a horrid solution.
People don't install updates, patches, etc.  Distros
ship them late, or never, if the distro is old enough.
A more appropriate solution would be to have
either the kernel or ntpd track the leap seconds
automatically.  First, the ntp protocol already provides
the needed notification of a leap second to anyone
who cares about it (i.e. there is no point in getting a
Linux distro involved in this -- a distribution mechanism
already exists, and works *better* than having a distro
do it).
If the kernel needs to track leap seconds, it could do
so using a mechanism similar to the "random pool"
that is saved across reboots.  Alternately, ntpd already
stores slew rates &etc. in files, and could track leap
seconds likewise.

Well, 'man 2 time' is as clear as mud. It talks about leap seconds,
but I can't figure out what its saying.  I rather
doubt that time() is doing what POSIX.1 seems to want
it to do (which is to ignore leap seconds?)
The reason I'm guessing that time() is wrong, is because
it seems that POSIX wants time() to use TAI time, and
we don't have that handy anywhere (because we've lost
track of those leap seconds)
