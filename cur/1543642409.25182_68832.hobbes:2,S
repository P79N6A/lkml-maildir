I do run 2.4 on most of my systems.  Thing is see, console code was
changed in 2.5 and so speakup doesn't work with it anymore.  I can't
very well rewrite speakup to work again on 2.5.x kernels if I'm
running 2.4.
I don't even mind providing error reports and the like but I have to
find someway to make bug reports consistant and reliable enough to be
useful to folks.
