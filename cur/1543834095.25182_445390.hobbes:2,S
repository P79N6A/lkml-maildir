Just out of interest, I've got a few XFS volumes that were created 24 months 
ago on a machine that I upgraded to 2.6.17 about a month ago. I haven't seen 
any crashes so far.
Assuming I get the newest XFS repair tools on there, what's the disadvantage 
of repairing versus creating a new filesystem? What special circumstances are 
required to cause a crash?
