The notion would be that we could have one i2c bitbanger using
the CONFIG_GENERIC_GPIO <asm/gpio.h> interfaces that could work
on most platforms, using that struct for platform_data and the
usual convention for platform device naming.
I'd expect that struct would be merged as part of such a generic
GPIO bitbang driver, and would only be used by that one driver.
SPI could use such a generic bitbanger too.  Until 2.6.21 it's
been missing that last step:  it's needed platform-specific
GPIO calls, so the bitbangers were generic except for those
lowest-level hooks.
