Yup. Okay, so it's definitely NOT an option.

It isn't, apparently. Or not with my test, anyway. Either way, it's
probably better not to make those assumptions about or rely too much
on the smartness of the compiler (we don't have *any* guarantees).
The best solution for now is probably to pass the log-level into each
line, as Dick Streefland suggested, though it would lead to a hairier
syntax, or just skip the whole interface for now, as Jan Engelhardt
suggested. Thanks.
