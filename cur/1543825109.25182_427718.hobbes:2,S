Subject: [BUG] Link problem on drivers/acpi/processor_idle.c

In 2.6.17-rc5, the GNU linker gives me this message:
WARNING: drivers/acpi/processor.o - Section mismatch: reference to .init.data: from .text between 'acpi_processor_power_init' (at offset 0xec7) and 'acpi_processor_cst_has_changed'
It is basically pointing out a potential bug on from processor_idle.c,
on this line of code:
     dmi_check_system(processor_power_dmi_table);
The problem here, is that processor_power_dmi_table is declared as __cpuinitdata,
and is not guaranteed to exist when invoked from code other than __init code.
The acpi_processor_power_init() routine is NOT marked as __init code.
Cheers
