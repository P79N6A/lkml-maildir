Actually, isn't the clear page function capable of doing
some magic, when it writes all zeroes into the page, that
causes the zeroes to just live in CPU cache without the old
data ever being loaded from RAM?
That would sure be faster than touching RAM.  Not sure if
we use/trigger that kind of magic, though :)
