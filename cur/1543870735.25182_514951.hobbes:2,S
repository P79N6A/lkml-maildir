Even with only 4 banks per CPU, and 2-way interleaving, we could still
power off half the DIMMs in the system. That's a huge impact on the
power budget for a large cluster.
No, it's not ideal, but what was that quote again ... "perfect is the
enemy of good"? Something like that ;-)

Batch jobs across clusters have spikes at different times of the day,
etc that are fairly predictable in many cases.
