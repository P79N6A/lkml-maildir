1247*255*63 == 20033055 sectors.
= 10.256924 * 10^9 bytes 
They could have called it 10.3 Gig...
Of course we count in 1024's, so it's 10,016,527 KB or 9,781.7 MB
or even 9.552 GB.
255*63 sectors are 7.844 MB per cylinder, so perhaps the true
capacity of the disk is really a bit larger  (9789 instead of 9781)
