Well one question is "does it make sense to make a keyring session a part
of the call_usermodehelper() API?".  As it appears that only one caller
will ever want to do that then I'd say no, and that it should be some
specialised thing private to the key code and the call_usermodehelper()
implementation.
So unless you think that a significant number of callers will appear who
are actually using the new capability then it would be better to keep the
existing call_usermodehelper() API.
