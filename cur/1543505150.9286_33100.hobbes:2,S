Can a 1.3meg bzImage boot off floppy? Or do you mean boot code including
that in a bzImage itself?
There's something vaguely related to open source issues here, although not
directly pertinent.. How come floppy drives aren't bigger these days? I
took apart a 2.88 meg floppy drive the other day. The head positioning
stuff is rather simple. The 2.88 meg drive was probably built around 1991
or 2. A 20 meg floppy drive would be a good open hardware project. 20 meg
is a lot of linux/GNU/unix. Most of what I use fits in 12 meg.
