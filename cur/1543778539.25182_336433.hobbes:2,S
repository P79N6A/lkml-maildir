I think you may have misunderstood me here.  v4l didnt make the 
patches... You (akpm) did... We included them in our cvs when you merged 
them into -mm:
add-type-checking-to-pm_message_t-bttv-fix.patch added to -mm tree
add-type-checking-to-pm_message_t-tuner-core-fix.patch added to -mm tree
add-type-checking-to-pm_message_t-msp-fix.patch added to -mm tree
add-type-checking-to-pm_message_t-tda9887-fix.patch added to -mm tree
Trust me, nobody did anything wrong here, and everything that needs to 
be done with regards to this is already done, AFAIK.
I'm just saying it would be handy for the cvs to be able to compile 
separately with both -mm and -linus trees automatically.  I just sent 
you a patch that solves the issue.
