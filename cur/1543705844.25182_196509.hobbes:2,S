I think what started the discussion was that
if anyone wanted to look at the code and start to comment 
before we have a 2.6 patch ready they can download it from bitkeeper at
http://infiniband.bkbits.net/iba
or if you want, I could post a tar ball of the latest BK change set on
sourceforge,
or you can wait till we make all the changes to the makefiles, etc, to
allow it to 
easily integrate into the 2.6 build environment.
Any preference ?

Christoph, he didn't say merged.  Let them submit it for review... and
then comment on it.
