And you thought I was kidding when I said it was mostly working :)

Wow. 10 minutes is a pain.  That certainly explains your interest...

I suspect the hardware shutdown and start up logic for NUMAQ cpus needs some
special handling.   Does kexec_test not print anything, or were you not patient
enough?

Small steps.   When I bypass the BIOS I need to get all of the information
the kernel normally would get from the BIOS from someplace else.  Currently
you can use the "mem= " kernel command line parameters.  Of you can dig the
/proc/iomem and /proc/meminfo and other places and get the BIOS's memory map.
There isn't a really good source, so I started with something that would work,
and I will work the user space tools up to something that works well.
I will happily accept patches :)
