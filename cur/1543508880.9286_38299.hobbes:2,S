Alan, you've got the ALS120 listed on your supported soundcards page, but
I've broken my back over one for the whole day. Mine returns a DSP major 3
minor 2, which is in theory an old SBPro, but even forcing major 4 in the
driver won't make it work. I'd write it off as WSS junk and chuck the $10
card, but since you're the authority on the matter, I'm left wondering if
you've ever seen it working.
