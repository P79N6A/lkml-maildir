In megaraid.c IO_LOCK_IRQ and IO_UNLOCK_IRQ are only defined for >= 2.4
(they are present since 2.5.1-pre2) and the since Al Viro's
kdev_t -> block_device * conversion you get a compile error when trying 
to use megaraid.{c,h} in 2.2.23.
If it's intended that this file is still used in kernels < 2.4 some
changes are needed.
