Ah, excuse me, please. I think missed the original subject of this message - I
also subscribed this morning to the list and did not get the first one of this
mails.
Of course, new hardware drivers could be best tested within a new kernel. I
think, this differences the dev-kernels form the stable ones and of course it
makes no sense to include very new drivers into an existing stable kernel
release... it maybe rather complicated to difference a kernel breakdown from a
driver breakdown, but this might only be a complicated thing to me ;-)
By the way: are my messages in HTML- or plaintext-format? I don't know, which
format is used by this browser based notes mailing system, so excuse any
HTML-messages - I will correct this if needed.
