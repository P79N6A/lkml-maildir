Subject: 2.6.14-rt1: oprofile doesn't work anymore

Several months ago oprofile just stopped working on my system.  All I
have changed on the system was updating the kernel.  This used to work
perfectly.  I figured it was something I overlooked but recently I
double checked everything and I can't for the life of me figure out
what's wrong.
I am using the simple "profile" script that Andrew Morton posted several
months ago.  But no matter what I do, all I get is:
opreport error: No sample file found: try running opcontrol --dump
or specify a session containing sample files
(Of course I have tried running opcontrol --dump, it has absolutely no
effect)
Examining the log files I see that it does not collect any samples.

Is there something in the -rt tree that's known to break oprofile?  Or
did the userspace interface change in an incompatible way?
