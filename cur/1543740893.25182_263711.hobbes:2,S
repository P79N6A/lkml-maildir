Once group_exit is set, it should never be cleared and group_exit_code
should never be changed.  It's set at the beginning of do_coredump.  If
do_coredump returned nonzero, there should be no way group_exit_code could
have changed from the value do_coredump set.  If you hit one of those
BUG_ON checks, there is a problem I don't understand.  I would like to know
how to reproduce it.
Thanks,
Roland
