Hi!
After patching & recompiling the kernel/modules the system cannot find the
3com NIC (3c509). The init_module() tells, that such a card cannot be found.
I played a little bit with several parameters (irq, xcvr), but it didn't
help. The driver refuses simple to reconize the card. 
It goes without saying that former versions did reconize the card.
ThanX
