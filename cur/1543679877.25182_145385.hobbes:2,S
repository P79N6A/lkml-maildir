Which is the whole point of it.

So some application has it's signal handler on the signal stack and
instead of returning to the kernel, it detect where it left off before
the signal, mangles the last two stack frames, and goes back directly?
If this is correct, it definitely saves a lot of time, but it also
means that the kernel has no way to ever detect a broken signal
handler, if it operates from the signal stack.
What is the point of the seperate signal stack anyway.  I like it,
because it allows me to handle signals, even when the normal stack is
broken for some reason.  So the point is robustness, not performance.
If that is the only point, I don't mind making the signal stack a bit
slower, but even more robust.
