Subject: [PATCH] Update udf documentation to reflect current state of read/write support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch changes Documentation/filesystems/udf.txt from saying that
read/write mounts on cd media are not supported to instead state the
current level of support.  Specifically that it works fine on dvd+rw
media and can be made to work on cd-rw media via the pktcdvd device.

-Write support requires a block driver which supports writing. The current
-scsi and ide cdrom drivers do not support writing.
+Write support requires a block driver which supports writing.  Currently
+dvd+rw drives and media support true random sector writes, and so a udf
+filesystem on such devices can be directly mounted read/write.  CD-RW
+media however, does not support this.  Instead the media can be formatted
+for packet mode using the utility cdrwtool, then the pktcdvd driver can
+be bound to the underlying cd device to provide the required buffering
+and read-modify-write cycles to allow the filesystem random sector writes
+while providing the hardware with only full packet writes.  While not
+required for dvd+rw media, use of the pktcdvd driver often enhances
+performance due to very poor read-modify-write support supplied internally
+by drive firmware.
