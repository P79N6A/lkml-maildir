  Several aspects of this;
  1) Programs will need to actually be coded against this shared
  library which probably will be more advanced that just usning normal
  file access code.
  2) Then we redo it all again to fit in the kernel, as a kernel
  plugin or user-level plugin.

  I am not saying that there should not be any thought behind
  implementing something. But from many hear I just hear a big no,
  without any thought about it either.
  Named streams and meta files are just one example of a general
  access to extra data that belongs to files. It seem to me as a much
  simpler way for program to use those than to link in several various
  libraries to do the same thing. 
  Plugins were just another thing that could extend the functionality
  of these streams and meta data. Reiser4 has a plugin architecture,
  although not yet any run-time support for loading them. Is this so
  bad that we have to prevent it?
  No one has to use them. maybe at some point it would be possible to
  specify which classes of plugins that could be loaded by a user and
  his files.
  What are the complaints about. The technical challenge to make
  things like this secure, or the concept to have this functionality
  at all. I do not think that because something is hard to do, it
  should be dismissed.
