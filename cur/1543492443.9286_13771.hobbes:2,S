Great, but only if existing kernels check the version.
If not, there would be a huge security hole.
I expect that the header must be mangled, unless you have some other
way to stop old (unpatched) kernels from running the executable.

As you may have guessed (by the tack-it-on-the-end hack), ELF format
knowledge is surprisingly hard to find. Help is welcome. I and several
other people will be abusing the format this weekend.
Q: What is the easiest way to modify an ELF section, adding it if it
does not already exist? Are there naming or ordering rules?

I hope that is on the web somewhere.
