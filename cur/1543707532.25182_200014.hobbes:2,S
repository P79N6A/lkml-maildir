No, because it can come back at any time 8(

Um, the code was taken from sched.c to kthread:
2.6.3 migration_thread():
	set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
	schedule();
2.6.3 migration_call():
		kernel_thread(migration_thread, &startup, CLONE_KERNEL);
		wait_for_completion(&startup.startup_done);
		wait_task_inactive(startup.task);
		startup.task->thread_info->cpu = cpu;
		startup.task->cpus_allowed = cpumask_of_cpu(cpu);
So, if the migration thread has been preempted immediately before
schedule(), wait_task_inactive returns, but it can come back from
preempt while we're messing with startup.task->thread_info->cpu.
Now, the latter part is wrapped in kthread_bind(), which should really
be doing the wait_task_inactive itself (doing it in kthread_create is
overzealous).  But the race is still there.
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
