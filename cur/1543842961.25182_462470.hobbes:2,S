SIG_CHLD is the only case where I think we will be sending a signal
from the child pid namespace.
Reading pids from the status files in /proc, from a parent namespace,
is another example where we need to deal with the pid of children.

I don't see the list getting longer until we get into a nested pid namespaces.
As long as the interface is well defined for the container in a container
case I don't mind having additional restrictions.
I will note that you can get some extremely weird interactions if
you do things like open a file descriptor in the parent pid namespace.
Fork two children each child in a different  pid_namespaces.
fcntl(F_SETOWN) is called in one child, and fcntl(F_GETOWN) is called
in the other child.
So we can't just call BUG_ON, if we have can't find the namespace.
But returning 0 from pid_nr should be fine.
