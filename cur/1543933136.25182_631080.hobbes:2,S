Looks much nicer, good job.
However I changed the kobject api again, so some minor changes will need
to happen (kobject_init() and kobject_add() parameters have changed),
and you don't need to call kobject_del() right before kobject_put().
Hm, that last one was always true, so that wasn't needed before...
Do you want me to add this to my driver/ tree and fix up the kobject
issues there so it all builds properly, and it gets sent to Linus for
2.6.25?
thanks,
