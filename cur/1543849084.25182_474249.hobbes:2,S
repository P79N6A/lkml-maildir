Just out of interest. Why does anyone actually _want_ to keep
mount/umounting to the point where they run out of ports? That is going
to kill performance in all sorts of unhealthy ways, not least by
completely screwing over any caching.
Note also that you _can_ change the range of ports used by the NFS
client itself at least. Just edit /proc/sys/sunrpc/{min,max}_resvport.
On the server side, you can use the 'insecure' option in order to allow
mounts that originate from non-privileged ports (i.e. port > 1024).
If you are using strong authentication (for instance RPCSEC_GSS/krb5)
then that actually makes a lot of sense, since the only reason for the
privileged port requirement was to disallow unprivileged NFS clients.
Cheers,
