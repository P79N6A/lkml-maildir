  Digital Hinote II will hang on kernals 2.4.X if ps2 mouse ( built in 
trackball is used ), not present in 2.0.38-39 kernels .... this will 
hapen after a bit of use, but is repeatable.
  Due to writing to the status register before it's ready as far as I 
can se.
  fix: change all mdelay(1) in pc_keyb.c to mdelay(2)'s .. ( mdelay(1) 
will be on the timing limit.
( /usr/src/linux/drivers/char/pc_keyb.c )
  Might also be present during high load on machines running GL on AGP 
video cards, not 100 % sure same symptoms, above seem's to fix ???? ( 
strange ).
  / best regards, Lars Segerlund.
