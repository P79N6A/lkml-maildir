Unfortunately, my manager has reminded me of an essential deliverable
that I have for another project, due in two weeks.  I'm going to need
every one of those days.  So I will have to take a two week sabbatical
from this design work.
It might make sense to reconvene this work on a new thread, with a last
message on this monster thread inviting all interested parties to come
on over.  I suspect a few folks will be happy to see this thread wind
down.
I'd guess lse-tech (my preference) or ckrm-tech would be a suitable
forum for this new thread.
Carry on.
