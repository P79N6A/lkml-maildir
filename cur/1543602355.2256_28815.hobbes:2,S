Subject: 2.4.10 data corruption ?

hello,
two machines (both athlon) did strange things after i upgraded to 2.4.10 
(started to crash at random, i got errors loading shared libs after upgrading 
them and a reinstall of the same .deb's fixed it)
both are athlons, non-overclocked. On one of them i always ran 2.4, the other 
is new so it could be a hardware failure ...
I didn't find (if there is) the actual corruption yet, i'll do md5sums on the 
broken and the correct machines tomorrow.
Someone got similar problems ?
greetings,
Frank
