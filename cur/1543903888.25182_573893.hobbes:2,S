Are you sure? I doubt it. It would need a full asm parser to do this
properly and then even it could be wrong 
(e.g. when the sections are switched like Linux does extensively)  
gcc doesn't have such a parser.
Also on x86 gcc doesn't need to care about long/short anyways because
the assembler takes care of this and the other instructions who cared
about this (loop) isn't generated anymore.
You're probably confusing it with some other compiler, who sometimes
do this. e.g. the Microsoft inline asm syntax requires assembler parsing
in the compiler.

AFAIK it counts like one operand.
