Wrong attitude. They exist, and we should think of how to take advantage
of their efforts. If you ask them to stop development, they won't stop,
they'll just go on in another direction, the wrong one.
Of course I agree Linus should NOT go in the wrong direction
just to support them...
You should not ask what you can do from them, but what they can do
for you B-)
  [a bit off-topic]
  BTW, you suggested that it's done this way to force people into the
  bug-fixing step, instead of letting them develope new stuff before
  they're finished with the old one. If you give them the freedom
  of doing that they want (no penalty), the same "invisible hand" will
  keep them from making the mistake (al least twice). No kernel
  developer likes to be known for producing buggy code... And even if
  some developer abandons a piece of code of its own, somebody who's
  interested in *using* it will pick it up and start maintaing it.
  As the basic axiom is "if you really want it, code it!", what's wrong
  with "here's the alpha version: if you want it stable, debug it!"?
  What's the whole purpose of releasing under GPL if not for letting
  people freely improve each-other code?

You don't encourage people to work on the frozen branch by making life
difficult to those who have no interest in the frozen branch, since
they have no code to stabilize, just new one to write.

I like a stable kernel too: having two releases instead of one
makes half of the changes go into one, half into the other.
The fewer the changes, the fewer the bugs, the fewer the work to get
it stable.

The real trouble is that even if I start -tm, i won't be 2.5. I can't
put the changes Linus wants to put into it, and most of all, i can't
do it the way he likes. So it won't be a real 2.5, and noone will be
interested on it.

I can always say he's wrong about that. Maybe he won't change his mind,
but I've done all I can. B-)

OK for me. After all, i can't make it clearer... and yet noone seems to
agree with me. Going back to lurker mode... B-)
