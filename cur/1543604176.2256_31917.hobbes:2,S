Oh, you are right.
I meant MP vs XP part, sorry.  From what I gather, MP is no different
from XP, although perhaps "certified for SMP" -- despite costing more

Completely Agreed.  I am thinking of getting a dual AMD system for doing
more kernel work (tackle AMD and SMP).  My main machine is a P3 now.
