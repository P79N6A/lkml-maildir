I've been working with Hubertus Franke on a patch based on Simon
Winwood's original MPSS code with some design influence from Shimizu's
code. Shimizu Naohiko has also been involved in the effort, primarily
2.4.x-based patches. Also, Ingo Molnar (and possibly other redhat.com
contributors) deserve priority as theirs was the first patch to provide
such functionality. Rohit Seth has also provided some large page
functionality already included in 2.5.x mainline.
Others may yet become involved.
Thanks,
Bill
