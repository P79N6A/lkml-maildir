on the other hand, this ioctl works perfectly with 2.6.10:
    bash-2.05# ./sg_simple /dev/sr0
    v30527
    Some of the INQUIRY command's response:
        PLEXTOR   CD-R   PX-W124TS  1.00
    INQUIRY duration=1 millisecs, resid=40
unfortunately, I cannot switch to 2.6 easily. one reason
is that the pcnet32 driver does not work. at least, with
2.6.10, it does not crash the machine anymore (as it did with
2.6.7), however
NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth1: transmit timed out
eth1: transmit timed out, status 03f3, resetting.
and I do *not* want to buy a new network card just because
I switch kernels.
