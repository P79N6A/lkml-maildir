Hi, Andrew,
Sorry, I sent a patch with wrong title.
On m32r, ACE is an acronym of not "access error", but "access exception".
Please drop the previous patch entitled "[PATCH 2.6.19] m32r: Fix access
error handler to pass full 32-bit address".
I will resend a correct patch again.
Thanks,
From: Hirokazu Takata <takata@linux-m32r.org>
