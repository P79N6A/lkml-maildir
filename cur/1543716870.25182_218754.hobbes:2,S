In this particular case you did not include the header file that defines the
file_operations struct.
May I suggest you read "Linux Device drivers" by Jonathan Corbet.
It's available somewhere on the net, but I can recommend the paper version.
On lwn.net there is also a nice series of articles refelcting the changes
from 2.4 -> 2.6, also made by said Jonathan Corbet.
