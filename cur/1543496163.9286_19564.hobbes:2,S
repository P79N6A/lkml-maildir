Guys, this is all convoluted ways of fighting symptoms. The cause of
"rm taking a long time" is that the indirect blocks are scattered all
over the disk.
Now that can be fixed in two ways. 
One is to allocate the indirect blocks in a way that they are
clustered together a bit more. On a 1k filesystem, we can speed up
"rm" a factor of 10 by allocating 10 indirect blocks near eachother.
That means that the delay of removing a 1G file is still measureable,
but on the order of 3 to 6 seconds, which is acceptable for handling
LARGE files.
Another would be to make ext2fs use "extents". I believe I've heard
that work is already on its way to do this. 
If we have extents, then a single "indirect" block will most likely
give us 10 to 100 times more data-blocks that need freeing. Clearing
the bitmaps might become the bottleneck in that case.
