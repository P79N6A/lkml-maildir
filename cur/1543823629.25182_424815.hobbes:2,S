Much as I'd love to side with Jeff against you and Adrian ;)
I think you're right.
I see no reference to page_mapping() in the unionfs source (and at
present there's no other justifiable modular use of swapper_space);
but my guess would be that Jeff is being more conscientious than is
called for in getting it to sync up with the kernel -
The unionfs source does contain its own inline "sync_page" which
comments that it "is copied verbatim from mm/filemap.c".  I'm
guessing Jeff has noticed that it's no longer a verbatim copy,
has made it so, and is thereby involving page_mapping().
No need for that here (nor for the smp_mb nor for the io_schedule):
unionfs's sync_page is working on a locked pagecache page of the
lower-level filesystem, that's not going to be a PageSwapCache page
nor a PageAnon page (nor even a truncated page with NULL mapping:
page lock is held).  Just use page->mapping as before.
(But I notice that unionfs better not have a tmpfs in its union:
the unionfs use of grab_cache_page is not strictly compatible with
the way tmpfs pages are swapped out under memory pressure.)
