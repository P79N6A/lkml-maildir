Subject: [PATCH][TRIVIAL] Fix comments in 2.6.16-rc6: s/granuality/granularity/
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi there,
I was grepping through the code and some `grep ganularity -R .` didn't
catch what I thought. Then looking closer I saw the term "granuality"
used in only four places (in comments) and granularity in many more
places describing the same idea. Some other facts:
dictionary.com does not know such a word
define:granuality on google is not found (and pages for granuality are
mostly related to patches to the kernel)
it has not been discussed as a term on LKML, AFAICS (=Can Search)
To be consistent, I think granularity should be used everywhere.
Here is the patch for the latest 2.6.16-rc6.
All trivial, all comments only, not "affecting kernel stability".
If somebody can take care to push it for rc7, if not for later.
I reading LKML, but please CC me if you decide to to (not) accept it.
Kalin.
