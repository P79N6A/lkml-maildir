Nice report, thanks.
I can reproduce the problem here.  Simple testcase:
main()
{
	int fd;
	fd = open("a", O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666);
	if (fd < 0)
		perror("open");
	exit(0);
}
The same happens with CONFIG_NFS_ACL=y.
Binary searching shwos that the bug was introduced by
nfsacl-acl-umask-handling-workaround-in-nfs-client.patch
