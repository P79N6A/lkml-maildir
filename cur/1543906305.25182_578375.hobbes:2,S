Ok, so even Intel has problems with the handoff.

This would be solution too, but what if someone uses the uhci controller
and don't want the
ehci. So a single Kconfig flag wouldn't be enough, we have to add 3
flags for uchi, ohci and
ehci. I think this maybe a little bit difficult when configuring the kernel.
The best solution would be when we could use the CONFIG_USB_xxxx_HCD
flag, but it
seems that some hardware has problems when we disable the handoff and
let the BIOS
control the usb controller. Do you know any of this hardware?
Thanks
