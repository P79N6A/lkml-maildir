The only thing i want to see it's the difference between the behaviour 
of the different schedulers on the same test setup. In my test -ck2 was 
a bit better, not 200% worse as in Bill's measurements. I don't compare 
absolute values on different test setups.

No i'm not, i'm running only one instance of glxgears inside the GNOME's 
environment.
