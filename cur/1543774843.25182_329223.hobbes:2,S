Sorry seem to have lost track of this thread of thought.
These are optimizations that try to avoid false aliasing as
a result of the linker placing hot spots into the same cacheline. These
are not predictable per se. Some future patch may rearrange variables that 
then produce another case of false aliasing.
In order to demonstrate the effect, I would need to be allowed to put 
some hot variables into the same cacheline. And that seem to be pointless 
because we all know the outcome.
