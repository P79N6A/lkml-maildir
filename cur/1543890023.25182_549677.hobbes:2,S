Fedora scripts for hibernation are supposed to tell GRUB to set the 
default kernel on the next boot to be the current one before suspending 
to disk, so that it comes up with the same version it was running and 
the resume can succeed. If the way you're triggering the suspend 
bypasses this mechanism, you'll see this problem.
