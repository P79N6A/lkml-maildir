A little problem which I haven't got when I use 2.6 without mm patch :
gcc -v :
version gcc 3.3.2 (Debian)
cat /proc/version :
Linux version 2.6.0-test9 (root@mzh) (version gcc 3.3.2 (Debian)) #1 Sat 
Nov 1 16:28:07 CET 2003
instead of :
Linux version 2.6.0-test9 (root@mzh) (gcc version 3.3.2 (Debian)) #1 Sat 
Nov 1 16:28:07 CET 2003
I don't know why "gcc" and "version" are inverse with mm patch, but it 
causes a little problem when I compile
nvidia driver. (IGNORE_CC_MISMATCH).
This problem doesn't occur without mm patch.
