Hi Len, I'm sending this email to remind others who may also have had a
problem when shutting down their IBM Thinkpads.
Shutting down the laptop turns off LCD but the machine remains on still.
This happens on a T42 (and others?)
I have tried some of your other patches on k.o that are in testing phase,
but they don't appear to fix this issue.
Thanks
Shawn.
