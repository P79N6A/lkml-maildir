If we just went with "whoever asks first" then clearly one of the 
blocked threads asked before the unlocker made its new request. You're 
arguing for my point, then.
Other ambiguities aside, one thing is clear - a decision is triggered by 
the unlock. What you seem to be arguing is the equivalent of saying that 
the decision is made based on the next lock operation. The spec doesn't 
say that mutex_lock is to behave this way. Why do you suppose that is? 
Perhaps you should raise this question with the Open Group.
