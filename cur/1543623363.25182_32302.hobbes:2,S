Well, our MIPS-based platform (whose changes haven't been submitted
yet). We have some broken PCMCIA hardware that requires us to actually
simulate interrupts with a hi-res timer (by calling ide_intr() directly).
Yes, it's ugly, but it's our only solution. This change would enable us
to put our device-specific interrupt "simulation" code into the ide_*
routines only.
It's not a must right now, but it looked like something that was left
out, since the rest of the ide code uses the ide_* generic #defines...
Thanks,
Will Jhun
