Actually, this sounds pretty sane and IMHO is somehow the biggest common
denominator concerning linux users and their kernel configuration
recreational activities :); but seriously, going all over the menus of Kbuild
and turning everything off is a lot of work compared to turning on the
several things I need on my system. "default m" is also not a good thing
since compiling of unnecessary modules is simply dumb for a system
that's just not going to use them.
