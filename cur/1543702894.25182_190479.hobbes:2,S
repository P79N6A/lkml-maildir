Version 2.6.4 of perfctr, the Linux performance
monitoring counters driver, is now available at the usual
place: 
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/perfctr/
Three architectures are now supported: x86, AMD64, and PPC32.
Since I only have a PPC750, I'm looking for testers with 74xx
or 604 processors. Even if you don't intend to use the driver,
booting a kernel configured with CONFIG_PERFCTR_INIT_TESTS=y,
loading the driver module (if not built-in), and emailing me the
PERFCTR INIT kernel log messages would be helpful.
Version 2.6.4, 2004-01-12
- Added support for PowerPC 604/7xx/74xx processors.
  * Overflow interrupts are not yet supported due to a hardware
    erratum affecting many 7xx and early 74xx processors.
  * The user-space components support PowerPC, but CPU detection
    and event set descriptions are not yet implemented.
  * Supported in 2.6.1 and 2.4.23 and newer 2.4 kernels.
- Updated kernel support: 2.6.1, 2.4.25-pre4, 2.4.22-1.2140.nptl
  (FC1 update), 2.4.21-4.0.2.EL (RHEL update), and 2.4.20-28.x
  (RH 7.x/8.0/9 update).
