I am trying to configure my slip login , is it possible to have slip
server and client same IP, I mean with slip server assigned IP
192.168.1.1 can I use the same IP to connect to the SLIP
server..Whenever I try to login I get a message like
Lat login on......
starting normal SLIP for user XXX
Your Ip is 192.168.1.1 and your server is 192.168.1.1
The login gets killed immidiately..Before this I am just doing the
following steps..
1> slattach -p slip /dev/ttyS0 &
2>slattach -p slip /dev/ttyS1 &
3>connecting both the serial port with a cable
4>ifconfig sl0 192.168.1.1 pointopoint 192.168.1.1 up
can anyone tell me whether this will work or not....
thanx
