I now agree, that disc passed fsck and mount well enough to make the ls
failure interesting.
What to try next after fsck passes, I do not know, ouch, sorry.
Offline I'm working to comment the fs/udf/ source.  Even me finishing
that might not do you much good, unless we can figure out how to
reproduce your trouble at my desk.

P.S. Five postscripts:
1)
> even with ide-scsi, though.
Whoa.  You weren't engaging in the taboo act of running ide-scsi in 2.6
back when ls failed, were you?  (If you are, then please remove
ide-scsi, substitute ide-cd, and confirm or deny that exercise actually
made no difference.)
2)
The disc didn't actually pass the phgfsck without complaint:  The
standard phgfsck egrep is:
$ egrep -i '(info|warning|error):' 
http://web.tiscali.it/kronoz/ucf_test.log
        PVD  72  Warning: Volume Set Identifier: "040420_0906",
        PVD  72  Warning: Volume Set Identifier: "040420_0906",
        Error: Number of AVDPs less than 2: 1, AVDP at 256
$
Non-compliance!
All the same, I'm guessing these complaints do Not explain the ls
failure, since to my newbie ear these sound like mount issues and we
know you can mount.
3)
I can't now rapidly reproduce the collection of file lengths you report,
because sparse files in UDF, even when the underlying volume is not
sparse, as yet crash my Linux-2.6.5.

Yes phgfsck trouble like that is normal, thanks for asking.

I agree your conclusion is reasonable, I do not myself yet know the
udf.ko code well enough to firmly confirm or deny your conclusion.

Any chance this link will still work, a year from now?  (I ask because
I'm hoping to see a collection of observed UDF non-compliance come into
being.)
