They are altogether used by RedHat compatible startup scripts, and should 
not be necessary on embedded systems if your interfaces are ifconfig'ed. 
Is your routing table (route -n) set up correctly?
Try tracerouting from ref host A to ref host B while running tcpdump on 
the embedded penguin.
However, I don't believe this is an issue to linux-kernel, we should 
consider private talks...

You're expecting files to be applied.
