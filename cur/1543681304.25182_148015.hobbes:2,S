Sure - I'm trying it on Mandrake 9.1
I've already had fun with the module_init_tools from 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rusty/modules/
Basically after doing the ./configure --prefix=/ && make moveold, I was left 
with a bunch of dangling symlinks in /sbin
I've since grabed the src.rpm from here: 
http://people.redhat.com/arjanv/2.5/SRPMS/
and that seems to be behaving a bit more (although I haven't rebooted yet :)
Everything else is from a standard Mandrake 9.1 install, so I'm using gcc 
3.2.2 and associated gubbins.
