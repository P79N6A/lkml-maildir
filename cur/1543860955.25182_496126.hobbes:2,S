A bit of a niche area, but as long as this driver doesn't look like high maintenance then it could be enough.

These sound like they would be nicer in the block layer, to cover other devices where you know there is flash at the bottom.

No, as we don't give a rats ass about them. I don't know why they stuck a FAT requirement into the spec. Perhaps Microsoft wanted a chance at the extortio^Wlicense money for any patent issues.

Probably. I haven't really put that much time into the wiki lately. It turned out to be a one man show, so I'm doubting its usefulness.

There is some relation, yes, but I don't remember the details right now. More important is that the card can only be set to one block size at any given time (both read and write). So unless you want
terrible latency by switching block size back and forth I'd suggest selecting one size and sticking with it.
As the newer cards only support a block size of 512 bytes, the most future proof would be to use that.

Yes. On my rather slow ISA device, the speedup was over 100% for writes.
