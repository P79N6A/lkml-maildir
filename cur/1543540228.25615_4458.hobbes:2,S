Hi,
Please see 
http://technocrat.net/964824712/
 . Is there any good
reason that we can not run Linux executables with the execute permission
turned off, by default, on all stack and data pages? Wouldn't this stop
buffer-overflow security exploits that try to inject executable code onto
the stack or into function tables? i386 won't support it, but other
architectures do.
	Thanks
	Bruce Perens
