<SOAPBOX ON>
I've been programming for 8 years now, and have been working on/with linux
since the 1.xx series.  I KNOW the differeince between ELF, A.OUT, and
C/C++ source code.  I know the difference between the 340 or so MB of
programs that come from my home-rolled distribution and the 48MB of free
space that is available to compile a kernel in.
I'm not an idiot like so many of you assumed.  Many of you had helpful
responses, while you did miss the point, they were helpful.  But several of
you were quite rude in your responses, especially Mr. Buell (whose name I'm
not sure if I spelled correctly)
Now I'm remembering why I decided I was going to NEVER EVER develop
anything for the Linux kernel (at least nothing that I'm releasing
publicly...  I've done some neat magic w/ MP3 and the SB16 sound card as
well as 'midi-font' technology on same HW), and I think this will stay true
forever.
In any event I'm very disappointed.  If this is how many of you still are
it's no wonder scoop (for freshemat.net) was going to call it quits.  This
is BS you guys.  If you rip on people you don't know, who could possibly
HELP YOU LATER then you, and many others will LOSE OUT.
