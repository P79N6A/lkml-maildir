Would it not be rather more readable as something along the lines of:
static inline int pfn_valid (int pfn) {
        int nid = pfn_to_nid(pfn);
        pg_data_t *pgdat;
        if (nid >= MAX_NUMNODES)
                return 0;		/* node invalid */
        pgdat = NODE_DATA(nid);
        if (!pgdat)
                return 0;		/* pgdat invalid */
        if (pfn < pgdat->node_start_pfn)
                return 0;		/* before start of node */
        if (pfn - pgdat->node_start_pfn >= pgdat->node_spanned_pages)
                return 0;		/* past end of node */
        return 1;
}
However, I'm curious as to why this crashes X, as I don't see how this
code change makes a difference in practice. I didn't think we had any i386
NUMA with memory holes between nodes at the moment, though perhaps the x440
does.

PS. No, I haven't tested my rephrasing of your patch either.
