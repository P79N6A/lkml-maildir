I do think you've hit upon something interesting here.  Though it's
not quite as you describe.  We don't have to wait for the flush_tlb_mm
to sort it out: the flush_tlb_page in ptep_establish in break_cow in
do_wp_page resolves the discrepancy much sooner.  But your point is,
that's already too late: T2 inserts a "smudged" copy of the page which
T3 was working on, it does not contain all the data T3 had written there.

I don't get your pte to 0 suggestion.  What we seem to need is to
flush the TLB sooner (as well as in ptep_establish).  A first guess
is that do_wp_page needs (in these circumstances) to flush_tlb_page
before copying the page.
But this stuff is subtle, and TLB flushes shouldn't be added lightly.
I'm certainly not going to rush to propose the fix (and I could easily
be wrong in seeing the problem).  But perhaps others will be surer.
