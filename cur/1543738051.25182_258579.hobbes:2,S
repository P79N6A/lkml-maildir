The issue is caching.
We have to do a pass over the data to copy it to userspace.  If we do the 
checksum verification then, it's basically free since its already in the cache.
If we do it at select() time, we end up having to do two passes over every 
packet, one to verify the checksum, and one to pass it to userspace.
I agree with you though, it'd be nice to have select() change behaviour based on 
whether the socket is blocking or not.
