The one functionality I miss way too much in linux (comparing to win32) is
FindFirstChangeNotification and ReadDirectoryChangesW thing.
These functions have one nice purpose: we can watch a directory hierarchy
for changes an efficient way. e.g. AFAIK via dnotify I can only see that
directory was changed, but cannot actually get all the changes. If I will
re-read all directory, I can miss some changes (if other process is
tampering with this dir too).
With ReadDirectoryChangesW I can read all changes happened with watched
hierarchy by doing sequence of, probably blocking, reads from some handle,
and each read will return some action/event "description" (e.g. "created file
a; renamed file a to file b; etc")
I was thinking about the way of implementing this functionality in linux. By
adding my own syscalls with semantics similar to sigfd.
And, thus, not only signals can be delivered through the same way. Maybe it
worth generalizing into some other "abstraction" ?

P.S. Kernel already have an almost similar thing for different purpose -
rtnetlink.
