Translate and store them in utf-8 at kernel level same as VFAT mounted
with iocharset option.

There are far more programmes than only iconv. First of all readline
library is kind of broken because it counts (or at least it did a year
ago) bytes instead of characters. I won't use UTF-8 nor force anybody
else to do so until readline will handle it properly.

And it is good in a way, however, i think kernel level translation
should be also possible. Either done by a code in each filsystem or by
some layer above it.

It depend's on what it is used for. It is very good fs for removable
media. None of linux native filesystems is good for this because of
different uids on different machines. Since VFAT uses unicode it is
possible to see the filenames properly on systems using different
codepages for the same language (1:1 is possible).
