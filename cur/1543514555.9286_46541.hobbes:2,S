MIPS II instruction set and better and the Alpha don't have an xchg
equivalent but ll / sc instructions, which are more universal.  Using
them to implement an xchg-like implementation however ends up as a
a loop of at least five instructions which we'de prefarably want to avoid.
The MIPS I (R2000, R3000, embedded toys) situation is worse, they don't
have atomic operations at all.  Historical side note - external hardware
was being used to implement atomic operations on such systems for SMP. I
don't know the details but what I know looks bad enough that I probably
will refuse to add R3000 SMP support.  Performance is even worse, I've
been told that atomic implementations were taking a number of microseconds
in the range of three to four digits.  Imagine, *miliseconds*.
Currently we have two types of atomic operations in the kernel, atomic
with respect to interrupts including bottom half handlers and atomic with
respect to other processors in a MP system.  We however only have a
single implementation of all atomic operations.
