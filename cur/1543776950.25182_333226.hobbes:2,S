Except that relayfs contains files that all behave in a very specific
way: as relayfs buffers, while debugfs may contain a variety of different
types of files.
I kind'a see what you're trying to say, and I fully understand that some
debugfs users may indeed use the relayfs fileops to add an entry in
debugfs which serves as a buffer, and that's the very reason we exported
them to boot. But there's something to be said about having a single
filesystem (and therefore tree somewhere in /) which contains entries
dedicated to a single purpose: dump huge amounts of data out of the
kernel and into userspace whether or not the system is being debuged.
From a user point of view, it sounds awfully weird if they're using
"debugfs" on a production system ...

Here's from 2.6.13-rc2-mm1 fs/relayfs/inode.c

It's been there ever since you've asked for it earlier this year :)
