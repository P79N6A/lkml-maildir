Using a consistent agglutination policy results in more easily
understandable conversations.  You've done a good job advocating top
posting, but until recently the linux-kernel norm was bottom posting.
The mix of the two is what is being objected to.  Standards exist for
good reasons, and Tomas pointed out RFC 1855 and the lkml FAQ.
Please reply at the bottom.  Thanks.
Steven
