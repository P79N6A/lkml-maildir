Additionally, look at who tested the 'fix' up to now: Probably only
people who had a problem before. And for all of them, the problem got
fixed. But do we know what happens if we use this 'fix' on a computer
that is not broken? No. Perhaps it breaks when we apply the 'fix'?
OTOH, I think there are only two ways to find out: Either we put the
'fix' into a mainline kernel (linux -pre kernel or -ac kernel should
be enough) as a default and look if somebody starts complaining, or
we convince VIA to tell us what the register in question really does.
