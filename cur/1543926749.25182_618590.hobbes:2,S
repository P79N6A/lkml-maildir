While testing a kernel based upon ecd744eec3aa8bbc949ec04ed3fbf7ecb2958a0e
(with wrong boot arguments), I got the following bad page state entry while
NFS was trying to mount it's rootfs:

This seems to be caused by use of an uninitialised structure due to NULL
options being passed to nfs_validate_mount_data().  Ensure that the
parsed mount data is always initialised.
