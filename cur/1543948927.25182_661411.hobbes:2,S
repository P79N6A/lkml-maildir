Ok, now I understand your question - thanks.
I think your question arises from misreading what I wrote.
I did not say that I wasn't "aware of any problems that could arise"
I did say, as you quoted, from Thu, 28 Feb 2008 11:37:28 -0600:

 - This does not say no (none whatsoever) problem could (ever in the future) arise.
 - This does say not much (just a little) problem had arisen (so far in the past).
Apparently, you thought I was trying to reject the patch on the grounds
that no such problem could ever occur, and you were showing how such a
problem could occur.  I wasn't trying to reject the patch, and I agree
that the check made sense, and I agree that such a problem could occur,
as your example shows.
