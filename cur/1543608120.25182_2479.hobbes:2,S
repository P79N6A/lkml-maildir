No, the ioctl numbers are correct, it's ESD that's fscked.
    /* set the sound driver audio format for playback */
#if defined(__powerpc__)
    value = test = ( (esd_audio_format & ESD_MASK_BITS) == ESD_BITS16 )
        ? /* 16 bit */ AFMT_S16_NE : /* 8 bit */ AFMT_U8;
#else /* #if !defined(__powerpc__) */
    value = test = ( (esd_audio_format & ESD_MASK_BITS) == ESD_BITS16 )
        ? /* 16 bit */ AFMT_S16_LE : /* 8 bit */ AFMT_U8;
#endif /* #if !defined(__powerpc__) */
<sarcasm>
This is such a lovely piece of code!
<sarcasm>
Anyway, I can fix it now by adding the appropriate AFMT_S16_BE statement
guarded by a #ifdef but this sucks. Thanks to Peter Jones who spotted this
one.
