  Oh, come on guys!  Not "everyone" is using glibc, not even close.
Perhaps most of the kernel-hackers are using glibc, but the public at
large probably isn't.  I know of plenty of people using the older
distributions which are libc5 based (myself included). 
  The move to glibc2 is very painful, especially if you have a lot of
apps you've built yourself that you'd have to re-build as a result.  So,
don't go thinking glibc is the greatest thing since sliced-white-bread,
because it isn't.

  And as for RedHat being the "industry leader", no offense, but, boy I
sure hope not!  If you start promoting one distribution way above the
others, then you effectively kill the acceptance of the other
distributions in the market place.  I, for one, don't really like RedHats
environment.  It caters too much to the Windows(tm) crowd.  Not that
that's a bad thing, mind you.  If you prefer hand-holding and a graphic
desktop with lots of whiz-bang that resembles another popular desktop
operating system, then more power to you!  I don't.
  Personally I want to know about the details and have complete control
over every exacting detail of the setup.  And I want my desktop to look
and feel the way I want it to, from the ground up, not someone elses
pre-conceived notion of a desktop.  There are plenty of us who prefer the
other distributions and will not stand for having any one particular
distribution shoved into our faces.
