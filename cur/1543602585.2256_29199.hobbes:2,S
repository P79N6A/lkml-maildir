It hit me as well and I found the culprit, the crash happens in
usb-uhci.c:process_iso, where the following code used to be 'safe'
	for (i = 0; p != &urb_priv->desc_list; i++) {
...
	    list_del (p);
	    p = p->next;
	    delete_desc (s, desc);
	}
However, some infidel sneaked the following change into 2.4.10, late in
the testcycle, which is deadly. This patch needs to be reverted. If the
behaviour is wanted all uses of list_del in the kernel need to be looked
at very closely.
