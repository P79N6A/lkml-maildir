Dear Alan,
I want the contents of A, B, C, D registers of CMOS mapped registers.
But instead the driver gives the details about the bit masks of few of register A, B only.
The others are NOT available. 
I would also require to retrieve the day of the week info in RTC information. 
I tried the /dev/rtc but I don't get it there.
at the same time, I am able to get the entire CMOS information using the application attached which does not use any driver interface and instead use the ports directly.
But, the application tried to disable the interrupts on the processor. 
Suggest me the pros & cons of using this application.
Regards,
Mukund Jampala

Then you'll need to enhance the nvram or rtc driver to support the extra
bits you need. What doesn't it provide access to that you require >
