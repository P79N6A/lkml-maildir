+	 * 1. floppy_open() triggers a call to submit_bio(), but

+	 *    after floppy_open() has returned. Prior to 2.5.18, NULL
+	 *    queues were initialised when needed.
+	 * 2. fs/block_dev.c:do_open() changes bdev's block size
+	 *    after floppy_open() has returned. For some reason, this
+	 *    causes data corruption durings writes.
+	 * 3. fs/block_dev.c:do_open() sets bdev->bd_inode->i_size to 0
+	 *    after floppy_open() has returned. This cases ENOSPC errors
+	 *    on writes.
+	 * Workarounds:
+	 * 1. bdev->bd_queue is initialised here.
+	 * 2. Set bdev block size equal to the hardsect/queue size.
+	 *    This seems to cure the data corruption problem for raw
+	 *    accesses. VFS accesses to mounted floppies still cause
+	 *    data corruption for unknown reasons.
+	 * 3. Set i_size to 1.44M and bd_offset to 0.
+	 * 2&3. ++bdev->bd_openers to bypass do_open()'s changes.
+	 *    floppy_release() does a --bdev->bd_openers.
