The problem we face is that gcc in some cases mark the
destination section READ-ONLY and in other cases not.
So if we annotate two variables to go into the same
section and gcc only annotate one of them READ-ONLY them
we will have a section type conflict.
gcc is not consistent across architectures what to mark
READ-ONLY and not. And what we saw here was a combination
where on x86 the destinatin section were marked equal
(READ-ONLY or not READ-ONLY) but on powerpc were marked
different. One was marked READ-ONLY the other was not.
So when playing with const it is improtant to try out with
a 64 bit gcc for powerpc to see if it causes any section
type conflict. Note: 32 bit gcc does not have this
issue.
