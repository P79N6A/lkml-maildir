That's right to be done also in a 2.2.x stable trunk according to me.

Yes I've seen.

The point is that checking only rmem is half of the work done from my
point of view. For a rcvbuf too small the fast-path is the normal-path.

The user _can't_ predict which is the truesize of the bigger packet
involved in the transmission of data. Should he also take into account the
16bit alignment of truesize and the 16bit reserved by the hardware layer?
BTW why we are allocing in the skbuff data a atomic_t of space more?

Ok but for handle that you can instead simply use instead a special value
for rcvbuf (== 0) that will mean -> dropall incoming packets.
