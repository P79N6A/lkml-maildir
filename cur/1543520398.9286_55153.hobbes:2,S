 If the fd you are sending from or to is O_NONBLOCK then it isn't a
blocking syscall (AFAIK -- and looking at the source if
file_send_actor() used in sys_sendfile() returns 0 then
do_generic_file_read() finishes). Obviously assuming
file->f_op->write doesn't always block, but I think that's a fair assumption.
 Maybe you mean that _currently_ the kernel only allows you to
call sendfile() with a from_fd of an on actual file and files don't
honour O_NONBLOCK, but that isn't the same thing. IMO it's like saying
write() is always blocking because it will always page in the buffer.

I am always an optimist, but frankly there is no hope.
