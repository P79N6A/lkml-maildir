Apparently it broke with the commits that came in between 2.6.12 and 
2.6.13-rc1.
I can't get any closer than that, and someone else has also commented 
that this is when it died.  I hadn't needed it between may-june of last 
year and now, so I hadn't dug out the camera and tested it until the 
missus asked if I could make dvd's of some of her vhs stuff since the 
vhs player is on its last legs, not from head wear, but something on 
the board requires a healthy slap in the chops to make it work after 
its been off for a few weeks.
I was going to use the camera as a transcoder between the sloppily timed 
ntsc, and the firewire port.  Now it locks kino up tighter than a drum 
the minute you select the capture screen.  You have to click on the 
close button, and wait for the x server to ask you if you want to stop 
the process since it isn't responding.  But that once done, seems to 
clean up the mess nicely.

stupid bounce rules.  I do use spamassassin too. :-)
