Exactly. ONLY FILE* has ANY meaning. You CAN use it ONLY as opaque pointer.
FILE can be even typedef for void - it's perfectly legal thing to do.

You CAN use FILE pointer just fine. What you CAN NOT is to create it with
malloc, to use sizeof(FILE), etc.

Documentation does not states it. Happy now ?

And it's pretty legal thing to do. There are NO standards where stated that
you can assign to stdin or stderr. GLibC allows this but it's still
non-portable.

Sorry. EBADF is NOT specified to be returned from EBADF if you are trying
to call it for garbage.

Sorry once more. There are NO documetation for fclose in linux. Not at all.
fclose is NOT system call. It's library function so it's userspace issue.
And GLibC documentation does not have such info as well.
