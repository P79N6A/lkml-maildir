In Linux 2.2 SYN_RECV sockets are represented as open_requests (smaller
structures). Only after the ack in the three way handshake comes in a new
socket is created, directly in ESTABLISHED state. 
open_requests are associated with a listen socket. You're probably
looking at the listen socket. tcp_ipv4.c does the open_request check.
your ack is probably wrong in some way and thus never matches an
open_request, and it ends up being rejected by the LISTEN socket.
BTW, why aren't you doing that from user space via a packet socket?
