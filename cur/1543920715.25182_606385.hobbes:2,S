I hit the same thing, and fixed it with mrproper as well.  I assume this
is a result of the x86 merge.
Andi, is there a way we can detect the old include directories, and
error out?  Otherwise, we're going to get a ton more of these reports
when people do incremental patching up to 2.6.24.  I've been doing
nightly incremental builds for a year or two, and I think this is the
first time it has actually required manual intervention.
