Not exactly.
The front side bus of SLOTA only runs at 100MHz.  However, unlike SLOT1, it
syncs on the both the rising and trailing edges so it is effectively the same
speed as a SLOT1 bus running at 200Mhz.

and AMD expects the bus speed will scale nicely to 133Mhz then 200Mhz in the
near future :)
