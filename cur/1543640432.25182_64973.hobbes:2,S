Oh, ok. I've asked only because some time ago I wrote a small tool set
to get random bits from /dev/audio and feed them to /dev/random 
(ala audio-entropyd, but it does FIPS 140-2). You can configure how
many bits to account via RNDADDTOENTCNT every N bits you write to
/dev/random (I use 1/80). Since in principle it can take random data
from any source, I'd wondered if someone had an esteem of the parameter
for HRNGs. Thanks anyway.
