I am having problems with ipw2200. It does not connect to my WPA access
point unless I help it (for instance by setting the ESSID with
iwconfig). It seems to be related to driver version 1.1.2. I had the
same problem when 1.1.2 was the latest external tarball.
I have been using 1.1.3 and 1.1.4 external tarballs without problems for
a while. Zhu Yi pushed 1.1.4 to netdev-2.6/wireless last week. Is there
any chance it could be pulled before 2.6.18?
Sorry for notifying so late in the release cycle...
Regards,
Brice
