	No....  255 is illegal only for a /24.  255.255 is illegal for
a /16.  0.255 is perfectly legal for a /20 or bigger.  0.127 is illegal
for a /25.

	It will work just fine if the network mask is bigger than a /24.
130.205.1.0 is perfectly fine if it's a /16 but illegal if it's masked down
to a /24.
	Stop thinking in octets.  This stuff is binary.
