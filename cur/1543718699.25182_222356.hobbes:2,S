Eh, not if I read the numbers right:
2.6.7-p1: 24.86user 51.77system 2:58.87elapsed 42%CPU
24.86 + 51.77 = 76.63 seconds on CPU, 102.24 seconds of waiting
2.4.21: 28.68user 34.98system 1:12.34elapsed 87%CPU
28.68 + 34.98 = 63.66 seconds on CPU, 8.68 seconds of waiting
So, 2.6.7-p1 spends 16.79 seconds more in the kernel as you observed,
but it spends 93.56 seconds more waiting for I/O (or whatever).
Unless I'm totally missing something, the wait seems to be the
regression.
