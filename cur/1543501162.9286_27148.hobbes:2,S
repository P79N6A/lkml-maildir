I have come across a problem compiling 2.2.11pre1.  I'm using a 486 
with RedHat 6.0.  Everything seems to be going OK until I do the make 
bzImage.  I am using egcs-2.91.66, if that helps.
Here is the output of make bzImage:
gcc -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -o
scripts/split-include scripts/split-include.c In file included from
/usr/include/errno.h:36,
                 from scripts/split-include.c:26:
/usr/include/bits/errno.h:25: linux/errno.h: No such file or directory
make: *** [scripts/split-include] Error 1
