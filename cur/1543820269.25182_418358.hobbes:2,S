Yes, EDAC should not have existed without first working more closely
with the BIOS folks.  It's too bad we (Intel) didn't catch this.  The
BIOS folks where not in the loop with the driver folks making
contributions to EDAC previously.

I think what I'm saying is pretty clear and I don't think it is related
to whatever workarounds where done earlier.

I don't know of any technote.  It took me working with Soo Keong for a
few weeks to chase this issue down to the level I have.  The short
answer is that the BIOS assumes the payload OS would not be fighting it
for hidden device access and the EDAC driver violates this assumption.

It was just a screw up not to have identified this issue sooner.

I would place the warning in the probe or init code.
Attached is a test patch I'm testing now.  I don't like it, but it seems
to be working so far.  It basically fails the probe call leaving the
driver loaded.  I'm going to move the test to e752x_int so the driver
fails at init this am at restart my tests.

Unknown.  Also the BOIS teams for various platforms can modify the base
AMI functionality.  I know that at least one Intel e7520 based system
with AMI based bios seems to not expose this issue.  The point is that
without working out a handshake between the OS and the platform / BIOS
for this type of thing, loading EDAC without a patch like mine is
equivalent to playing Russian roulette.  You can't know which platform /
bios will blow up on you if you load the thing.
