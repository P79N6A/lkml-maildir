wow ! 2.3.18ac8 seems to be OK.
Another story but I realized with 2.3.18 that my apache-ssl can't
run with generating crazy growing error file :
[Fri Sep 24 14:08:18 1999] [notice] Apache/1.3.9 Ben-SSL/1.37 (Unix) Debian/GNU
PHP/3.0.12 configured -- resuming normal operations
[Fri Sep 24 14:08:18 1999] gcache started
[Fri Sep 24 14:08:18 1999] gcache: accept failed, error=107
[Fri Sep 24 14:08:18 1999] gcache: accept failed, error=107
It got size of 100Mb in some seconds :-(
