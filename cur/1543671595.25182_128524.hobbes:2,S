Since the Jensen is the only non-PCI alpha, I'd really prefer to
keep existing pci_* functions as is and make dma_* ones just
wrappers.
Actually what we need is a single function, for now just
struct pci_dev *
pci_dev_to_pci(struct device *dev)
{
	if (dev && dev->bus == &pci_bus_type)
		return = to_pci_dev(dev);
	/* Some day we'll be able to play nicely with "isa_bridge",
	   device parents and dma masks here (hopefully). */
	return NULL;
}
Then the rest would be
static inline dma_addr_t
dma_map_single(struct device *dev, void *cpu_addr, size_t size,
	       enum dma_data_direction dir)
{
	return pci_map_single(pci_dev_to_pci(dev), cpu_addr, size, dir);
}
and so on.
Though it's perfectly ok to have Jensen-specific dma_* stuff.
Ivan.
