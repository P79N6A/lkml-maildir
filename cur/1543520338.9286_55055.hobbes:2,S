phttpd used to be available from Signum Systems, Linkoeping
(*1), Sweden (
http://www.signum.se/phttpd/
). The company offered
professional support for free software.
Signum has been bought out by a company named Cendio Systems
(
http://www.cenido.se
). phttpd is now being maintained by Roland
Kaltefleiter of NetUSE GmbH, Germany (for which I happen to
work).
From 
ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/unix/phttpd/README
:
------
Phttpd is a lightweight and fast World Wide Web server that uses
techniquies like multithreading, dynamic linking and mmap() for
machines running Sun's Solaris 2 operating system.
(Preferrable Solaris 2.4 or newer).
Written by: Peter Eriksson <pen@signum.se>
It is currently being maintained by Roland Kaltefleiter, and the
latest version can be downloaded from:

Kristian
(*1) Linkoeping is also the home of another popular, free
     software webserver, Roxen (
http://www.roxen.com
). Not
bad for a small scandinavian town. Who says that it must be
Operating Systems all the time?
