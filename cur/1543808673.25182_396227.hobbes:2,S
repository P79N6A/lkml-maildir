Subject: [PATCH 0/5] new dasd ioctl patchkit

Here's a new patchkit to fix the dasd ioctl mess, against
2.6.16-rc2-mm1.  I've built an s390 crosscompiler to compile-test them and
I've booted the resulting kernel with a debian image in hercules (not that
this excercises the ioctl path a whole lot, but I didn't find tools that
actually used any of these ioctls).
The patches are also split more fine-grained than last time.
