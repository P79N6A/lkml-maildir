Why would you want such placement?
Potential problems: header files would have to be moved to
include/asm-arm = headers pollution.
All 4 drivers are, in fact, network (related) drivers.
drivers/net/arm would probably make (some) sense if it was
a single (or not so single) Ethernet driver.

It wouldn't make sense without the directory, no doubt.

Actually, that's exactly what this patch do.

Why exactly? They are network devices, who would expect them there?
How about the dependency mess (NET_ETHERNET etc.) that would be
created?
