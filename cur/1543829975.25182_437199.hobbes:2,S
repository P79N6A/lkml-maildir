Andrew,
I'm maintaining per-task delay accouting and taskstats interface patches 
so I'll take the liberty to reply :-)

The main problems identified are:
1. extra sending of per-tgid stats on every thread exit
2. unnecessary send of per-tgid stats when there are no listeners
3. unnecessary linkage of delayacct accumalation into per-tgid stats 
with sending out of taskstats
All three have an acceptable solution.
1. & 3. are going to be addressed in a patch I'm sending out shortly.
2. in a separate patch also being sent out shortly.

The rework will affect the number of per-tgid records that userspace 
sees (fewer), not the format or any of the
other details regarding the genetlink interface.
Will that be a problem for userspace ?
