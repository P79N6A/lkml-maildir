Any plans to fix 'hdparm -I /dev/atapi-cdrom-device' I reported to
you and Bartolomiej at the end of June? ide_*_taskfile
sets REQ_SPECIAL, but ide-cd calls cdrom_end_request(drive, rq, 1) 
on all such requests without looking at them or without trying to
execute them. This forces hdparm -I to think that ATA identify
suceeded and returned all zeroes:
/dev/hdd:
removable ATA device, with non-removable media
Standards:
        Likely used: 1
Configuration:
        Logical               max current
        cylinders             0   0
        heads                 0   0
        ...
Capabilities:
        no IORDY
        Cannot perform double-word IO
        r/w/ multiple sector transfer: not supported
        DMA: not supported
        PIO: pio0        
while 'hdparm -i' correctly reports that it is Toshiba DVD device
supporting IORDY, pio0-4, sdma0-2, mdma0-2, udma0-2, according
to ATA2-ATA5.
                                                Thanks,
                                                    Petr Vandrovec
