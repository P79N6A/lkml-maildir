I have succeeded in getting a program to hide itself from a 'ps -ax'
listing simply by zeroing out the argument table. 
--cut--
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
        int i;
        /* destroy the argument table */
        for(i = 0; i < argc; i++)
                memset(argv[i], 0, strlen(argv[i]));
        while(1); /* hang around, just kill me with ctrl-c */
}
--cut--
I think this is a potential security problem as someone might easily
misuse this to hide a 'malicious' program, and you would not be able to
identify it so easily using ps. 
Cheers, 
Alex
