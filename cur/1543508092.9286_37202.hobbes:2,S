Well sort of.  Linus always planned to do threads this way, but its only
been relatively recently that working pthread libraries have appeared to
take advantage of it.  For a long time linux'es pthread implementation was
implemented in user space and all threads ran inside of 1 process.  I think
this was still the case when we switched from a.out to ELF libraries.  At
some point Xavier Leroy wrote a clone() based pthread implementation that
is the basis of what we use today.  I do not think that it was a part of
libc5, but you could patch up a libc5 system to use it.  Xavier's package
is a standard part of glibc, so you have a reasonable pthreads implementation
on all newer Linux distributions.
