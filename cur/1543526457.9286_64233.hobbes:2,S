Linus accepted the gcc version of the patch.

It is... of the places that were using named initializrs, they were
using gcc syntax (this making the gcc patch a smaller one, which may
have helped its chances).  The perl script I posted can still convert
them to C99, so if Linus ever changes his mind, switching between the
two will be a quick procedure :)
