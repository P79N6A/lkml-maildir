Yes, you are right, it is something else.
The problem is, that in_interrupt() is true if local_bh_count()
is != 0, which basically sounds correct, but if we are in
spin_lock_bh(), local_bh_count() is also != 0.
This means, in_interrupt() is always true when called inside
spin_[un]lock_bh() region.
So, it is not allowed to call create_proc_entry after
spin_lock_bh(), because sub-function proc_create()
calles kmalloc() with GFP_KERNEL and then in_interrupt()
is tested again, which gives the wrong status and
causes BUG() in kmem_cache_grow().
Was this done on purpose ?
