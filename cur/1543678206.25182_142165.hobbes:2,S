Hello Willy, hello Marcelo,
in fact I noticed that doing multiple verify cycles the so-called corruption
happens rarely (read _very_ rarely) on the same files. So it is indeed very
likely that the read case is a problem.
Another thing to note is that I did not manage to produce a failed verify on a
dataset tar'ed to the 3ware raid and not to tape. I did not test that very
intensively, but from the tests I did I would have expected a corruption to
happen based on the cycles I did on tape.

Well, in fact I am a bit lost in the case, because of the shere data volume, I
have space for several sets on disk, but it takes a damn long time to produce
one cycle write/verify. Anyway I will do if that helps. The big problem with
tar is that I have (to my knowledge) no chance to let it somewhere save the
verify-failing data parts. I guess this could help a lot, because we could then
see what the corruption looks like, how long (in bytes) it is and so on.
If anybody has an idea how to achieve this goal let me know.
I am not 100% confident that the tests would look the same if I simply read the
whole tape onto the disks again and then verify via file compare, but anyway I
should try this too several times to complete the picture. 
Ok, weekend is here, I see what can be done.
Regards,
Stephan
