I did some testing to check that vmalloc is OK.  
First, boot and do a kernel build on COWed devices, which uses vmalloc space
for the block bitmaps.
Second, modprobed all modules, and made sure that one of them actually worked.
Ran a kernel build to induce lots of context switches, made sure it still 
worked.
It sure seems OK to me.
