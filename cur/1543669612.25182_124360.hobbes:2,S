You don't want to do that :)  You're starving other GFP_ATOMIC
processes, and will increase system failures due to lack of memory...
even though there may be plenty outside the emergency pools.
One option is to create a background kernel thread (via schedule_task or
schedule_work, depending on your kernel version) that allocates memory
which your tasklet then takes.
