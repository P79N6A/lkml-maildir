They do two different things, and people interact with them in two
different ways.  So, they should be two different file systems.

Will a user ever see the word "attribute"?  Also, these files represent
attributes of the main object in which they are attached to.  Hence the
name.

Doesn't it currently work the same way as sysfs with the backing store
being created on the fly?  If not, it should be pretty simple to convert
over if people are really worried about memory consumption, but again,
why don't we see how many nodes are really used on most systems (don't
want to add more complexity and kernel code if you never really need
it.)
