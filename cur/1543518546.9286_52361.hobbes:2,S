I have already stated many times why this is not a reasonalbe apporach!
Just that much: Take a S3Virge for example: check how many card
manufacturers use it! Check how many different hw environments they
use (memory etc). The bios rom is the safest to store this information.
Besides if you have a modularized kernel you could run a boot utility
and then load you driver. Where is the problem?
