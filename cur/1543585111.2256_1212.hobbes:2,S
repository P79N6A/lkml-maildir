I'd be surprised if dbench was anything other than disk-bound on most
systems.  On any of my machines, the standard error of a single dbench
run is *way* larger than 1%, and I'd expect to have to run the
benchmark a dozen times to get a confidence interval small enough to
detect a 1% performance change: are your runs repeatable enough to be
this sensitive to the effect of the allocator?
Cheers,
 Stephen
