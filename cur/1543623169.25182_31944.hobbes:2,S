Well thats up to you on how you implement it. mmap will tell you the truth
in overcommit mode 2 or 3. Nothing will get killed off when you try and
mmap too much or dirty pages you have.

Nothing of the sort. Sitting in a gnome desktop I'm showing a 41200Kb worst
case swap requirement, but it appears under half of that is used.

Like randomly killing another process off ? If you want to dirty the pages
pray and catch the sigbus then see memset(3). If you want to be told "sorry
you can't have that" and write a simple loop to pick a good memory size,
you need the address space accounting.
