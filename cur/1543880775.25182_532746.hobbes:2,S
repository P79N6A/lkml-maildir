I don't really follow why the drivers need a way to unbind even while
waiting to acquire the mutex.  Care to enlighten me?

I think we both agree that's not a good idea.  :-)

It all depends on how a particular subsystem is shaped but having such
thing would definitely help.

Yeah, exactly.  My argument is that that impedance matching between
lifetime rules must happen at some place and it's better if we can do in
the higher layer where we can afford more effort and thus complexity.
We're currently pushing that down to each drivers and not too many are
getting it right.  I think it's just unrealistic to expect every and
each driver subsystems to get it right, so some overhead at higher layer
is acceptable and we can definitely afford much more optimization at
higher layer.
Thanks.
