I'd be more inclined to blame it on the card driver, Hugo. I have a 
nightly rsync session that scans and updates a mirror of several 
partitions on my firewall box to a disk in this box, and it hasn't 
generated any error messages yet, over about 20 2.6.x kernels, 
currently running 2.6.5.  I get an 100% normal email from rsync every 
night, but no errors are being logged.  Its a 100base T network, 
driver 8139too on this end, an 8129 based card on the other end, and 
with an old (I think, its been 6 years) dlink FA-310 (ne2k-pci) on 
the other card serveing the dsl connection.
The firewall itself is connected to the dsl thru a second 10-baseT 
card and a router with the firewall connecting the 2 cards.
