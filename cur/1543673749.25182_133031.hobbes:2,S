Hi, a newbie question for kernel module programming ...
In my kernel module function, I want to call directly
sys_newstat(), sys_link() etc. Which header file I should
include? Other kernel functions I need to call are
namei() and kernel_lock(). Which header files are
relevant to those functions?
Generally, where can I get a documentation for this?
(or which directory in the linux source distribution)
thanks,
