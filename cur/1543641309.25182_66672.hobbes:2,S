What I found when I ran ram18.gz and ram24.gz was ...
ram18.gz has 18MB filled of available 28MB [6MB gzipped]
ram24.gz has 24MB filled of available 28MB [8MB gzipped]
in the case of ram24.gz, "inflate_stored" from lib/inflate.c was called,
but ram18.gz never called this function ... meaning the gzipped was
corrupted during boot up for ram24.gz. Where ... I don't know.
