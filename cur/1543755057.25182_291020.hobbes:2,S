Subject: [PATCH 0/3] - Three more input fixes for 2.6.11
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi!
The previous set introduced one bug, mostly harmless, but pretty
annoying - the hid-input driver fills the logs with the 'event field not
found' message. I'm sorry for that, I just tested that the patch does
what it should and didn't check the logs.
The last of these three patches fixes that.
The first fixes the MUX disabling routine in i8042 to really do
something on reboot, and the second patch from Andries adds a
documentation entry for atkbd.softraw.
Please include them before 2.6.11, as the bug described above would
cause a lot of e-mails to be sent to me.
The patches are available at
