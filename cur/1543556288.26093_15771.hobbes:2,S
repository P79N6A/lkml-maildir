My gut feeling on this is that when you mount a filesystem readonly
you mean "I don't want the filesystem to be modifiable".  Opening a
device for write never modifies the filesystem directly.  Devices are
gateways to resources external to the filesystem, the write permission
means something different for them.
Same is for sockets/pipes btw.
And I really wonder how you plan to fsck / if it has been uncleanly
unmounted and includes /dev.
  OG.
