With this change depmod require the precense of modules.order.
Could we make it optional so depmod are backward compatible?
It would also simplify the kbuild integration if depmod
could read the modules as a space separated list where
duplicates are allowed.
If we do so then the is no reason to escape to the shell
in Makeilfe.build and we do not have to remove duplicates either.
