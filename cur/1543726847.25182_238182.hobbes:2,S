Radeons need this quirk for broken VBIOS's that leave the ROM decoding
disabled.
   unsigned int temp;
   temp = DRM_READ32(mmio, RADEON_MPP_TB_CONFIG);
   temp &= 0x00ffffffu;
   temp |= 0x04 << 24;
   DRM_WRITE32(mmio, RADEON_MPP_TB_CONFIG, temp);
   temp = DRM_READ32(mmio, RADEON_MPP_TB_CONFIG);
Shouldn't this go into the radeon driver so that it will work with
hotplug? Or should it go in both places, a _devinit pci_quirk and the
radeon driver?
