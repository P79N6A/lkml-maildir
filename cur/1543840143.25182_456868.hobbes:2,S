I remember now why I decided to use the assembler macro rather than 
cpp.  The macro names the section after the note name (".note.NAME"), 
and it needs to be quoted so that the name can have spaces and other 
characters which would otherwise upset the assembler.  I couldn't work 
out a clean way to do this with the C preprocessor, since "as" doesn't 
support string concatenation like C does.

Isn't it enough that each entry start have the alignment?  But you need 
some kind of end marker to get the size of the desc field regardless.

Yes, I think having each note contain its own .pushsection/popsection is 
the cleaner way of doing it.
