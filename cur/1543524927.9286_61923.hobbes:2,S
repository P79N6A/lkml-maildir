Hi there,
I installed the kernel 2.3.39 a couple of weeks ago, apparently with no
problem.
I am interested in dealing with files larger than 2GB, that's why I
updated the kernel.
However, when I run the program which generates such file, once it gets
bigger than 
2GB, this is what I see with
ls -l
-rw-r--r--   1 pobmelat users    18446744071562253456 Jan 31 14:4
/scratch/pobmelat/cim.F16
Is this file size ok? are the unit changed? 
The program continues and It dies with a segmentation fault, could be
that error related with the >2GB file?
Note that the same program with smaller calculation (i.e. does not
create such a large files)
works ok.
Thank you all,
