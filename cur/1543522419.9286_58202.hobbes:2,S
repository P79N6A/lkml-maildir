  One thing that is not specified by Intel, as far as I can tell, is
whether or not global and non-global TLB entries compete fairly/equally
for normal TLB replacement.  Although my assumption is that they compete
fairly, given how little memory the TLB's actually map, I have always
taken the approach of using _PAGE_GLOBAL sparingly.  Clearly interrupt
and trap handlers, the scheduler, etc. should be global, but infrequently
executed kernel code need not be global.
  It would be worthwhile to benchmark all global versus judicious global
to see if any gain could be had.  If so, perhaps another kernel segment
could be created (i.e., "__global", like "__init" now).  Just a thought...
Thanks,
Mark
