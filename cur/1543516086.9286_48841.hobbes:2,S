I got abnormal kernel log messages this morning.  
Is it pretty serious ?

Nov 14 04:40:02 localhost kernel: EXT2-fs error (device ide0(3,2)): ext2_readdir: bad entry in 
directory #22: rec_len % 4 != 0 - offset=0, inode=1377843815, rec_len=16723, name_len=32

I try to use fsck to fix it, and looks like bunches of files (something
like #35) filled in my lost+found directory.  thanks,
ps. this is not from a power failure or improper shutdown, but just
    appears unexpectfully.
