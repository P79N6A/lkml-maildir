From a first review only, it looks like this patch prevents the chipset
drivers from disabling DMA mode on initialisation.  This is Really Bad(tm)
since some revisions of some chipsets must _never_ be placed into DMA
mode due to hardware bugs.  Even if the user selects CONFIG_IDEDMA_AUTO.
The code in sl82c105.c knows about the chipset revisions that this is
required for, and it looks like the code in ide-pci.c will override the
chipset if CONFIG_IDEDMA_AUTO is enabled.
