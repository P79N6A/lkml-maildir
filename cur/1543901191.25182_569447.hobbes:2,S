I don't think this analogy is good; what is the "peer" in this 
situation?
IMO, A better analogy is: signalfd() should provide 
similar semantics to sigwaitinfo()/sigtimedwait() (and/or
handling signals with a signal handler).

Yes, but in this case why has the '"virtual connection" with the 
signal source' been dropped?  
Why shouldn't one be allowed to continue reading signals from
the signalfd file descriptor after the execve()?  
After all, I can still fetch those signals with sigwaitinfo() 
after the execve().  Not being able to also dothat with signalfd 
just isn't consistent.
Cheers,
Michael
