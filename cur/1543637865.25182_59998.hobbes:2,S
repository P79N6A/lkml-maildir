Above is just a hack to get it working, I only moved it one level up,
instead of spending too much time on figuring out the complete
dependencies.

I think we should separate module initialization from this, as these can
be automatically ordered, what the posted patch demonstrates.
The initcall mechanism would then only be needed to initialize core kernel
services, which can't be build as module.
I'm only interrested to get the module initialization right, because
otherwise I get problems with the new module interface. I want to avoid
to include an explicit ordering, but currently some modules make use of
that *_initcall is mapped to module_init if compiled as module (e.g. usb
or pcmcia).
bye, Roman
