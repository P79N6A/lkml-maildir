With due regard to Alan, repeating the BS does not make it true.  Eric is in 
fact very wellknown in the kernel world, just not as a kernel hacker.  I'm 
perfectly content with his level of contribution, I think he's more than 
earned the right to spout.
And by the way, the wait for CML2+kbuild 2.5 is painful, I detest the old 
creaking cruft so much, I feel like I got something on me every time I change 
an option.  It hates me too, and retaliates by breaking itself in as many 
creative ways as it can.
