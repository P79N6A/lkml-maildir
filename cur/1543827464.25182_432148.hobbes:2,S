Yes, this was what I meant.

This I disagree with you.  The view that an operation should be totally
done 100% within the kernel is very utopic.  We already have features that
require both the kernel and userspace for them to work. The nearest example
is suspend/resume. It's good if you can make suspend/resume work without
additional effort, but that's not the case. Majority of users still need
utilities such as vbetool.

This is very ugly. Drivers should not care whether it's safe to load or
unload, unbind or bind, or whether a specific application is open or not.
This is not their job, this should be the job of the higher layer or an
arbiter.  And yes, the state of graphics is currently ugly, witness the
very long threads on how to to make everything work together.
Right now, the only thing I can claim is that trying to do an fbdev
operation while inside X will result in undefined, if not fatal behavior.
Don't do it. And no matter how many ugly hacks and workarounds we add
for the framebuffer layer, this will always be true.
