I have NF7-S too (and Seagate sata 120), and it works for me with :
- 2.4.23 and libata 
(
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jgarzik/libata/2.4.23-libata2.patch.bz2
)
- 2.6.0 and libata (CONFIG_SCSI_SATA=m and CONFIG_SCSI_SATA_SIL=m)
But it doesn't work with the siimage driver (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SIIMAGE=m) 
under 2.4.23 (didn't try it under 2.6, since it worked with libata...)
Question (for Jeff ?) :
Why is my drive (with 2.4.23 and libata2) on /dev/sda ? Why isn't it on 
/dev/hde, like (afaik) everybody else ? I'd like to run hdparm to 
improve performance (hdparm -tT gives ~ 20 Mb/s)
Thanks
