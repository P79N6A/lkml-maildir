Nobody should *ever* walk the list to find the length. Does anybody really 
do that? Yes, we pass the thing down, but do people *need* it?
[ Side note: some of the users of that length currently would seem to be 
  buggy in the presense of continuation entries, and seem to assume that 
  the "list" is just a contiguous array. In fatc, that's almost the only 
  valid use for the "count" thing, since any other use _has_ to walk it 
  entry by entry anyway, no? ]
The thing is, nobody should care. You walk the list to fill things in, or 
to write it out to some HW-specific DMA table, you should never care about 
the length. However, you *do* care about the "where does it end" part: to 
be able to detect overflows (which should never happen, but from a 
debugging standpoint it needs to be detectable rather than just silently 
use or corrupt memory).
But if people really want/need the length, then we damn well should have a 
"header" thing, not two independent "list + length" parameters.
