Subject: [PATCH 2.6] cciss: CCISS_GETLUNINFO fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/11/29/205

This patch addresses a problem with reading the partition table struct.
The last time this was submitted it was rejected on the grounds that the driver
has no business reading the partition table. I don't disagree with that, but
we have legacy apps to consider. Changing the ioctl would break those apps
already in customers hands.
Please consider this for inclusion.
