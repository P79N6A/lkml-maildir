The disk isn't using DMA.
Check your IDE config settings, make sure that the right chipset support is
turned on, that "Generic PCI bus-master DMA support" is enabled, check
"Force enable legacy 2.0.X HOSTS to use DMA", "Use PCI DMA by default when
available", "Enable DMA only for disks", etc.
If none of that gets it into DMA mode then we might have broken the IDE
driver.
