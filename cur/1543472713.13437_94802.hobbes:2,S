I know that many of the programs fall under the GNU license... this is
often a choice of the the author to make the software free, and GNU is a
good license to do so.  In many cases the author does not support the
FSF and is not a "GNU solder".
I believe that GNU's importantace is extreamly overstated in the free
software industry... it is not a religion or a cult.  It is a handly
license if you want to release free software.
Yes, I understand it might be difficult to run a linux system with no
GNU software... But GNU is not linux, and linux is not GNU.
There is way too many power tripping people around right now push free
software down people's throats, and pushing up their social standing and
ego by doing it.  I don't like it.  Free software is great, and I
release most of what I write as free software...  But I don't make it
into a cult.
