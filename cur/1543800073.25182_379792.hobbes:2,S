Intel is pleased to announce the launch of an open source project to
extend the current Intel PRO/Wireless 2200BG Driver project (IPW2200) to
support Master (Access Point) mode. The project site is up and in the
coming weeks you can expect initial source to become available providing
the limited access point functionality. This will be a point release, and
the code is intended to be used as it however any bug fixes and patches
are welcome.
