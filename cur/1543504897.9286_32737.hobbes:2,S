Hi Linus and others,
  sorry for bothering you, but I have some problems with understanding
latest changes (2.3.13-pre5) - so if you (or someone else) can answer
these my questions, I'll be very happy.
  (1) There is something wrong with /proc/iomem on my kernel :-(
readdir shows it, but open/stat says ENOENT :-( I did not find any change
which could cause this; but it is side issue for me currently
  (2) What should I do with this resource? From your code it seems that
     (a) resource is already plugged into resource tree, so no
         {request,release}_resource should be in driver
     (b) start contain base, end end address and flags some ids (maybe
         there should be some additional macros - it is not clear whether
         MMIO region is detected as !(flags & PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_SPACE_IO) or
         by something else.
         Probably IS_PCI_SPACE_IO() & IS_PCI_SPACE_MMIO() should be invented
         (otherwise I'll ignore these flags - hardware manual says, that
         region 0 for my matrox is always MMIO, so why bother with check)
  (3) check_region currently returns already allocated (so I have to comment
      out check_region checks from ide-dma.c & de4x5.c). And (2a) implies
      that there is no way to tell kernel that device (or resource) is
      allocated now. Did I oversight something or is there planned
      {request,release,check}_pci_dev(struct pci_dev*) for 2.3.13-pre6?
                                            Thanks,
                                                    Petr Vandrovec
                                                    vandrove@vc.cvut.cz
