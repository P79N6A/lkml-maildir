Ok, I've booted without the parameter, and without the jumper on clipping
mode (I'll do it tommorow, it's 1AM now) got something similiar to what
you've written, and everything looks ok.
BTW, I have created the paratition table and all paratitions when the
drive reported 90069840 sectors. Now it reports 90069839 - one sector
less. Any damage risk to my filesystems?
dmesg:
hdc: host protected area => 1
hdc: checking for max native LBA...
hdc: max native LBA is 90069839
hdc: (un)clipping max LBA...
hdc: max LBA (un)clipped to 90069839
hdc: lba = 1, cap = 90069839
