Are you talking a list that if I wanted to know what hardware I
should go out and buy for my next Linux box kinda questions?
It is a good idea but people come to the linux-kernel &&
linux-smp lists bcause they know that the driver writers are
usually 'listening' here. As well as this list probably has more
listeners here than any other list. To start a linux-hardware
list you may not get your email to the right people. 
This list is the only list that people will tell you where to go
find the info you want.
Just my .02 cents
Joe..cc me .. not on list..
