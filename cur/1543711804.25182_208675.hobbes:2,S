There are serveral dozen such formats as DDF, should those be put in too?
And then the next step is built in multipathing or stacking or .. or .... 
And pretty soon you're back at the EVMS 1.0 situation. I see the general 
kernel direction be to move such autodetection to early userland (there's 
a reason DM and not EVMS1.0 is in the kernel, afaics even the EVMS guys now 
agree that this was the right move); EMD is a step in the opposite direction.
