Hi Andrew,
in broekn-out-2007-04-28 I get:
(`make allnoconfig; make menuconfig` on i386...)
drivers/net/Kconfig:2327:warning: 'select' used by config symbol 
'UCC_GETH' refer to undefined symbol 'UCC_FAST'
grepping for it in the patches points me to git-powerpc.patch. Now that 
is a big one patch for git-side changes, which makes it a little harder 
to find out who put in that UCC_FAST. Please Cc the appropriate person, 
thanks!
Jan
