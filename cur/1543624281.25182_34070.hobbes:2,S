Yes, sorry. I had a dim moment... You are of course right.

Has worked well for a couple of times... (the extended tests anyway, the 
basic test always succeeds for me). DFT was detecting problems (and I was 
running it as I was having problems in Linux), then I upgraded the firmware 
and it no longer detected problems (and the drives have worked happily ever 
after). So I guess it just not perfect but it certainly worked for me.
