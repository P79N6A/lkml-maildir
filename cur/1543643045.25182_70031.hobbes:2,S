Yup, Fibre channel disks. So we know we can push at least that.

Nope, it's operating totally out of pagecache, there's no real disk 
IO to speak of.

Two 32bit buses (or maybe it was just one) and two 64bit buses,
all at 66MHz. Yes, the PCI buses can push more than the backplane,
but things are never perfectly balanced in reality, so I'd prefer
it that way around ... it's not a perfect system, but hey, it's
Intel hardware - this is high volume market, not real high end ;-)

Memory controllers are hung off the interconnect, slightly difficult
to describe. Look for docs on the Intel profusion chipset, or I can
send you a powerpoint (yeah, yeah) presentation when I get into work
later today if you can't find it. Theoretical mem bandwidth should
be 1600MB/s if you're balanced across the CPUs, in practice I'd
expect to be able to push somewhat over 800Mb/s.
