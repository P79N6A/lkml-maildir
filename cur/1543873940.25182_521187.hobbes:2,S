I guess I wonder what is wrong with the current scheduler? I am running 
2.6.20.2 on a whitebook
laptop with a core 2 duo 1.86ghz 2gb of mem with an intel 945 shared 
memory graphics processor.
I am currently running X with beryl have vncserver connected to my main 
system, which I am
using to write this email, I am running also firefox and both of ingo 
test programs. I also am running
a make -j4 on a kernel rebuild without having any pauses or any problem 
doing anything interactively.
So again what does this new scheduler fix?
