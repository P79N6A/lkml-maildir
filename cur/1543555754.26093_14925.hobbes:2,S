Jeff,
  I am also VERY interested in this, particularly on getting modems to work
with Linux at all.  I'm not reading the list right now, but I'd appreciate
any feedback you can throw my way on this.   Esp. if you DO get it setup and
working.  It sure would be nice to see Linux FINALLY support more modems out
there.  Hell, my Internal USR ISA modem is not even supported, but FreeBSD
had had support for it for a long time now.  :-(  Please let me know what
you find out, and I'm VERY interested in your RPM - hope there will be a
straight tarball for us Slackware Dinosaurs too.  :-)
Scott
