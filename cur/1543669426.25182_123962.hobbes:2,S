These examples were intended to show problems of the current dynamic and 
static numbering. I use examples like these to evaluate how a new 
numbering scheme helps to manage devices.

Why do we need majors at all? There is no perfect way to partition the 
device number, it will always be some compromise. This partitioning 
creates more problems than it solves.
Simply start allocating from 0x10000 and you can have (2^32-2^16)/partnr 
block devices.
The sg nodes problem is also easy to solve, but it requires the character 
device hash Andries removed.

So let's "taste" a few ideas. I don't want any decision, I want to get a 
discussion started, which explores some of the possibilities, so that we 
have _some_ idea of what we need.

I'd love to see this implemented and I would certainly like to help, but 
I'm mostly interested in the kernel side of this.
I haven't found much information about this, so it's difficult to comment 
on this.

These "enterprise device demands" certainly shouldn't break existing 
setups? The patches I've seen from Andries so far do exactly this.
What I'm mostly trying to get out of this discussion is how this large 
dev_t will be used during 2.6, as this requires decisions now, I'd like 
to know and talk about the possible consequences.
In this mail 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=104928874409158&w=2
I demonstrated how new device numbers can be generated, without breaking 
backwards compatibility, it's quite trivial to complete this patch.
