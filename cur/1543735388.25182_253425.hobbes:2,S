Florian,
I was unable to apply your patch #3 (phy-less-mode) and patch #4 
(bcm47xx support).
Could you please resend these two patches, diff'd against the attached 
b44 driver (my current version in netdev-2.6)?
Please send one patch per email, as per 
http://linux.yyz.us/patch-format.html,
 even when resending patches.
	Jeff
