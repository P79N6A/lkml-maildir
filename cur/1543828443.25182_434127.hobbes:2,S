==> Regarding [autofs] [RFC:VFS] autofs4 needs to force fail return revalidate; Ian Kent <raven@themaw.net> adds:
raven> Hi all,
raven> For a long time now I have had a problem with not being able to
raven> return a lookup failure on an existsing directory. In autofs this
raven> corresponds to a mount failure on a autofs managed mount entry that
raven> is browsable (and so the mount point directory exists).
raven> While this problem has been present for a long time I've avoided
raven> resolving it because it was not very visible. But now that autofs v5
raven> has "mount and expire on demand" of nested multiple mounts, such as
raven> is found when mounting an export list from a server, solving the
raven> problem cannot be avoided any longer.
raven> I've tried very hard to find a way to do this entirely within the
raven> autofs4 module but have not been able to find a satisfactory way to
raven> achieve it.
raven> So, I need to propose a change to the VFS.
raven> Please offer comments and suggestions or if anyone has an idea how
raven> this could be done within the autofs4 filesystem then I'm all ears.

This looks like the right approach to me.  I'd ack it.
