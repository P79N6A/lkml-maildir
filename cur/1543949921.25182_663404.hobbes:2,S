Subject: [PATCH 1/3] handle_stop_signal: unify partial/full stop handling
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/4/364

(on top of "[RFC,PATCH 1/2] signals: re-assign CLD_CONTINUED notification from the sender to reciever")
Now that handle_stop_signal() doesn't drop ->siglock, we can't see both
->group_stop_count && SIGNAL_STOP_STOPPED. Merge two "if" branches.
As Roland pointed out, we never actually needed 2 do_notify_parent_cldstop()
calls.
