I get this when trying to apply the patch (using 'patch'), but I don't
see why (yet):
|diff --git a/Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt b/Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt
|index 334ef2f..0a9c66a 100644
|--- a/Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt
|+++ b/Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt
--------------------------
Patching file Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt using Plan A...
Hunk #1 succeeded at 5.
Hunk #2 succeeded at 1373.
Hmm...  The next patch looks like a unified diff to me...
The text leading up to this was:
--------------------------
|diff --git a/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt b/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt
|index e9a5c28..9c97c68 100644
|--- a/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt
|+++ b/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt
--------------------------
Patching file Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt using Plan A...
Hunk #1 succeeded at 1.
Hunk #2 FAILED at 17.
1 out of 2 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt.rej
Hmm...missing header for unified diff at line 603 of patch
  The next patch looks like a unified diff to me...
can't find file to patch at input line 603
Perhaps you used the wrong -p or --strip option?
