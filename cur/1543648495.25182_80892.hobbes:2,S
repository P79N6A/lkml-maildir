I have a DELL Latitude CPi D233SP. With kernels from 2.5.40 to 2.5.43 using 
neofb during shutdown I get an Oops:
Danger danger! Oopsen imminent
MTRR setting reg 2
This is the second time I'm reporting this, the first time I CC'ed the 
mantainer too without results. Here is the link to my previous posting:
http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/linux/linux-kernel/2002-39/1108.html
With the 2.4.19/20-pre-last kernels scrolling up in the console is very slow 
using the neofb driver as I've wrote in my previous posting.
For more info please CC me.
