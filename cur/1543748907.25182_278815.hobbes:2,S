I'm not too sure about the relationship between the different types of
TPM chip you seem to be coping with and the PCI id's associated with
them. I think the normal way would be to have a separate self-contained
driver encapsulating the complete hardware specific bits for each
possible type of pci hardware device, or indeed i2c device rather than
mixing support for multiple different chips in a single driver.
I think often you would have tpm_atmel's module_init contain a call to
pci_register_driver to register the device id's associated with the
Atmel parts. Then the probe call does tpm_<specific>_init and registers
the tpm h/w device with the hardware independent bit using
tpm_register_hardware().
I would then be able to support the i2c variant of the atmel part by
registering an i2c part instead of a PCI one and calling
tpm_register_hardware from the equivalent i2c probe function.
Ian.
