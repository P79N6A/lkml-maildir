Small nit here, the Posix draft I have says that the definition shall be
omitted from the <limits.h> header on specific implementation where the
corresponding value is equal or greater than the stated minimum, but
where the value can vary depending on the file to which it is applied.
Please don't ever rely on PATH_MAX existing.  pathconf() is a better
tool.  We spend a lot of time chasing authors to explain to them why it
really is okay for the Hurd (i386-pc-gnu)'s libc to omit this
definition.
