It would appear to me that you haven't spent any time trying to deploy
a package on the various Linux systems.  Suse doesn't use glibc yet,
but they are RPM based.  Furthermore, their init layout is different
than RedHat's layout (and that's just where the problems start).

Don't be silly.  Approximation != correct.  To call it GNU is not correct
unless it is 100% GNU.  And it isn't even close.  Go do a wc on the X11
tree some day.  You don't see Gettys in here arguing that it should be
called X11-Linux, now do you?

Yes, but I try and ship software that runs on all platforms.  Unless you
are trying to do the same thing, your opinion isn't as important as
mine because you are just voicing a silly opinion for no technical or
business reason.

Once again you are proving that you haven't tried to do what you are
telling other people is trivial.  Please consider that the point of 
config.guess is to give installation scripts some useful information
and Stallman isn't helping one bit.  He's behaving like a two year old
instead.

Such as?  The only substantial chunk is gcc and that isn't part of the
operating system.

Yeah, right.  Have you actually tried this for any real application?  
Sure, it's true for simple stuff but it is far from true for anything
real.
