Heres some code I wrote for Stargames to do a CRC tracking of every
module loaded, it may have a race condition on module unload, but it
works perfectly for what they want to use it for....
It just runs a kthread doing the CRCing of the kernel test and modules
every so often...
I also have similiar code to do the same for shared objects loaded in
userspace, but it requires a daemon in userspace to the CRCing whose
license I'm not entirely sure of..
