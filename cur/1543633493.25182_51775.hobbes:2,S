hi list,
i was wondering if if it's reasonable to disable root write access
for procfs,driverfs files (which have file permissions set to read
only)
looking at the variables exported to sysctl: if those have read-only
permission, they are intended to be read-only, even for root.
did i miss the point here? any comments?
thanks,
	tm
