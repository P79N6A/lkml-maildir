    The design question is whether it's worth it to force programmers to
    wait through the extra recursion, or simply ask programmers to re-run
    "make depend" manually.
I agree, this is the question.
The current CONFIG_MODVERSIONS has race conditions.  It has bugs.
I believe correctness trumps efficiency.  I hate the current state of
the Makefiles, where there's a lot of "you must run make depend manually"
[if any number of undocumented changes occur in the source or the
configuration].
