The ENETDOWN path you're seeing only applies to queueless devices (like
loopback or a tunnel device). These should only set the queued stopped
flag when something is terrible wrong. 
All real network devices have a queue and go through the qdisc.

The qdisc queue acts like an IP network and deletes unnecessary packets. 
There is no provision to block when it fills because that would have
many sideeffects and complicate the stack a lot. There is an return
code though that is passed up when the queue fills (NET_XMIT_DROP or
NET_XMIT_CN), but it's currently only used by TCP but not passed to 
user space for UPD/RAW. It could be probably done with a special
socket option if there is a clear need.
