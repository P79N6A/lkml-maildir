Likewise, there's a race condition with any other concurrent use
of SIGSTOP.
Perhaps one could introduce a PTRACE_ATTACH2 that uses "addr" to
indicate the signal that should be used to sychronize attaching.
That way, programs that use STOP/CONT for their own purposes could
be attached to with ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH2,pid,SIGTRAP,0), or such.
If the process is already stopped, the debugger would be notified
with WSTOPSIG set to that signal instead of SIGTRAP.
