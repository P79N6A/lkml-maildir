There were a number of somewhat ugly softirq limiting patches that
Robert tried out (not spitting them to scheduler-aware context) and some 
combination of that worked well in Robert's setup. I will see if I can 
revive that. That said, we would need to find out how badly we affect network
performance with that thing.

Not necessarily, we can do a call_rcu_bh() just for softirqs with 
softirq handler completion as a quiescent state. That will likely
help with the route cache overflow problem atleast.
