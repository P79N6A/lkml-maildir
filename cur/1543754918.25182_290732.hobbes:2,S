Having looked at a lot of disks, I think that it is definitely worth 
forcing a write to try and invoke the remap.  With large drives, you 
usually several bad sectors in the normal case (drive vendors allocate 
up to a couple thousand spare sectors just for remapping).
Depending on the type of drive error, the act of writing is likely to 
clean the questionable sector and leave you with a perfectly fine disk.
