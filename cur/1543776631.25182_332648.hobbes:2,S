Since we (SUSE, many thanks to Andi Kleen and Andrea Arcangeli) have
already fixed most of the breakage "usb-handoff" causes on certain
(nvidia, etc) boxes, because of unusual memory layouts and iounmap()
that can't cope with that, I believe it'd be a good idea to enable
"usb-handoff" on vanilla kernels by default as well - SUSE already has
it enabled for more than a year.
