Subject: [PATCH] FM Synthesizer support configuration for 2.3.18
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/9/19/1

While mucking about with FM Synthesizer support configuration I noticed
there were two choices, CONFIG_SOUND_ADLIB and CONFIG_SOUND_YM3812.
Since both choices ended up adding the same two source files
(adlib_card.c and opl3.c) I believe one to be redundant.  The attached
patch against the base 2.3.18 kernel deletes the CONFIG_SOUND_ADLIB
choice and makes a few appropriate changes elsewhere.
Hopefully this will reduce confusion (at least on my part) when adding
FM Synthesizer support.  Please consider for inclusion in 2.3.  It
compiles and works on my system with a PAS16 soundcard.  Feedback
welcome, but be gentle; this is my first attempt at a kernel patch.
Alan, this is the same patch I previously sent you in private email.
