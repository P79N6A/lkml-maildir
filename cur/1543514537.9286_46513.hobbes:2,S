The compatibility entries are the "old" names, such as /dev/mixer,
/dev/sg0 and so on. Basically all that crud which sits right in /dev.
If your configuration depends on these names, then you'll need to
install the latest devfsd, which maintains those names.
BTW: I'm happy to see your From: address is now valid.
