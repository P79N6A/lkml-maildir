1) Try normal NFS tuning, such as rsize/wsize tuning.
2) You're entering synchronous writeback mode, so you can delay the problem by 
raising dirty_ratio to 100, or reduce the size of the problem by lowering 
dirty_ratio to 1.  Either one could help.
3) It sounds like the bottleneck is the vxfs filesystem.  It only *appears* on 
the client side because writes up until dirty_ratio get buffered on the client. 
  If you can confirm that the server is actually writing stuff to disk slower 
when the client is in writeback mode, then it's possible the Linux NFS client is 
doing something inefficient in writeback mode.
