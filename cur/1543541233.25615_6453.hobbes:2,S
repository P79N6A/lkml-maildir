Every CDROM drive placed in a PC supports 512 byte sectoring (usually right
out of the factory.)  The rarer find is a 2048 byte sectored drive common
to old Sun hardware -- infact, most Sun's cannot boot from a CDROM that
doesn't power up in 2k mode.  (All of my plextor drives have a jumper for
setting the block size.)
Personally, I wouldn't blame the drive.  The biggest problem is the limit in
the HFS driver.
