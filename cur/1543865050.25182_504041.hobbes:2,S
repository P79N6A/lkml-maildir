BTW another comment: I was told that at least one of the big databases
wants ms resolution here. So to make your scheme work
would require a HZ=1024 regular interrupt. But that would also make
everything slower again due to CPU overhead as it was learned in the 2.4->2.6 HZ 
transition. 
So it might not actually be worth it.
