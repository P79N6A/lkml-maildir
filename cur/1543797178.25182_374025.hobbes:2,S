could you send your .config and gcc version please ? I've checked the
code and it's not easy to find what data is accessed in your oopses.

could you please also tell us what partition tar reads data from ? I've
understood that you have some disks on your adaptec card and some software
RAID, so if you could roughly explain the setup, it would be great.

It may be doable with a few more info. Please also confirm that your
System.map really matches your kernel (for the oops report).
