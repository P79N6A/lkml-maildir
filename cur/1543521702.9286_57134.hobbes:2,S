    Apparently this is also the same on the Abit BP6.  Since I don't use USB
at all (and I'm not even running 2.3.x), I can't say for sure, but I do know
that people can't use USB properly on the BP6 under Windows 2000 if they set
the MPS version to 1.4.  It works perfectly on 1.1.
    Has anybody actually got USB working on MPS 1.4?  (On Linux?  Don't care
about Win2k, funnily enough 8).
