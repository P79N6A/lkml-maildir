Hi Alan!
do you know that there is a source code of driver for HPT370 raid at the
manufacturer web?
http://www.highpoint-tech.com/370drivers_down.htm
http://www.highpoint-tech.com/hpt3xx-opensource-v13.tgz
Maybe that this can be added to the kernel, there are many motherboards on the
market with such controller onboard. Is there any poblem with this driver?
As I know, hpt370 is supported only in IDE mode by kernel 2.4.18.
With regards,
Petr
