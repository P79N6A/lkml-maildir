Hi,
I have this problem when running 2.5.22, make can't run itself inside a
Makefile.
Let's say I have this Makefile:
test:
	( make -v )
It fails saying this:
( make -v )
make: *** [test] Error 139
I don't have any idea about what can be causing this error, might be something
to do with reiserfs...
Any ideas?
