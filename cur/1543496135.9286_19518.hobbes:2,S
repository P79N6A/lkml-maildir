   I've asked in the suggested places in the FAQ, but no one seems
   able to answer this question.
   I'm receiving this message, and want to know what's going on:
   May 17 07:59:15 acacia kernel: neighbour table overflow
   I apologize if it's off-topic, but I don't know where else to
   ask...
Something on your system had brought the ethernet interface up, yet
the loopback interface has not been brought up as well.  A system
without it's loopback interface up and functional is not a networking
host.
The message is otherwise harmless.
