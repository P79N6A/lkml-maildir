This particular one has cropped up a multitude of times, i can assure you 
that you're not the first. Try searching the archives for 
__free_pages_ok, nvidia and a few other keywords. I've seen that 
particular bug first hand and its definitely the work of the nvidia 
driver. Try their 2314 driver, i can't recall seeing it with that 
particular version.
