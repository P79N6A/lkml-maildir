Hello Marcelo,
I tried plain rc6 now and have to tell you it does not survive a single day of
my usual tests. It freezes during tar from 3ware-driven IDE to aic-driven SDLT.
This is identical to all previous rc (and some pre) releases of 2.4.21. So far
I can tell you that the only thing that has recently cured this problem is
replacing the aic-driver with latest of justins' releases.
As plain rc6 does definitely not work I will now switch over to
rc6+aic-20030523. Remember that rc3+aic-20030523 already worked quite ok (4
days test survived).
My personal opinion is a known-to-be-broken 2.4.21 should not be released, as a
lot of people only try/use the releases and therefore an immediately released
2.4.22-pre1 with justins driver will not be a good solution.
Regards,
Stephan
