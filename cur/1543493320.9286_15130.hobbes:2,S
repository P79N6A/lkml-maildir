With NFS you do not have true permission checking. Thus you need some
form of synchronization between 2 different tasks writing to the same
inode. If they are writing to the same page, then you want to flush
the write of task 1 before copying the stuff from task 2 in order to
prevent task 2 from riding on the credentials of task 1. "This is not
bug, but a feature" 8-) (see below).

It is: The user's credentials want to be checked by the server. The
client does not have all the necessary information to make absolutely
sure that the user is authorized to write. This is specially true of
NFSv2 which has no 'ACCESS' call for checking permissions upon opening
the file. Permission checks are only really made during the actual
write. (Yes, this is a 'bug/feature' of NFSv2).
Imagine user A is allowed to write: he fills a page. User B who is not
allowed to write by the server ('cos /etc/group is desynchronized
between client/server or something like that) modifies the page before
it is flushed asynchronously. Since user A set up the write request,
his credentials are used, and the write is accepted. Security
problem...

In the write gathering code, PG_lock is set while the page is actually
being written (during the RPC call). That should avoid the above
problem.
You're probably right about PG_updatepage. I don't think that would be
a problem, but IMHO, copy_from_user in 'generic_file_write' is
definitely the wrong thing to do...
