Ok, this should be fixed in current -bk (snapshots will be built at 4AM 
PST as usual, so they should show up reasonably soon).
I also merged/updated the old kallsyms fixups from Rusty, so together with
the updated module loader we should be back to "working order" both
without and with modules and not missing any features.
Please test,
