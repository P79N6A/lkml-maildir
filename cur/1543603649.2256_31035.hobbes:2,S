I like the two box strategy and have written a detailed description of
how to set it up (right down to the wiring diagram for the serial

http://www.kernelhacking.org/docs/2boxdebugging.txt
This will become part of the forthcoming kernelhacking-HOWTO...
Feedback on this document from anyone would be very much appreciated

happy hacking,
Andy
