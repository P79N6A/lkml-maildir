ISTR I used to (want to?) do this a lot when I had to use boxen I didn't have
root on, especially Solaris boxen which had nothing useful installed by
default.
If someone had already compiled for themselves a copy of whatever program I 
wanted, I prefer to hard link it than symlink it because that way it doesn't 
disappear when they have finished with it, or when their account is removed.
