This is a configuration error: check modprobe.conf for the options for snd and 
remove the 'device_mode' part. Looks like the debian alsa stuff has this small 
incompatibility with the 0.9.6 kernel modules. BTW, I had the problem with 
-test3 already.
I am by no means an ALSA expert, but this solved the problem for me.
