Though this worked for me before, it appears to have stopped working
and I don't think I reverted the code (sigh). Are you by any chance
using something with apm in, or using it as a module and removing
the module? The only difference here between working and non-working
is that I've suspended and resumed the machine (/without/ power
management / apm compiled in).

I am informed by someone who really should know that this /does/ work.
