Hope this helps.
(NOTE: this is general privilege set mathematics, may not apply
to linux yet.)
P being process permitted set
E being process effective set
I being process inheritable set
S being process saved set
A being files allowed set
F being files forced set
0 being the empty privilege set
P=E=(I[parent process] unioned with F[program] restricted by A[program])
I[child process] = I[parent process]
S=(I[parent process] intersected by A[program])
When effective UID is changed from the original:
S=E and then E = 0
When/if effective UID is changed back to original:
E = S
