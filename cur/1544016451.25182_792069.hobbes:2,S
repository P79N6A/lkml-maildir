Hey alright.(I finally got around to  trying netlabelctl out!).
The two systems I have for this are: Dell latitude x200
running ubuntu jaunty, kernel is 2.6.29-rc1.
with netlabel_tools_0.18 which was an rpm packaged
that I converted to .deb.(can't remember the repository where I grabbed 
it from);
The wireless card for the dell is a dell 1350
using bcmxx(b43-phy0); works great.
The results when using netlabelctl with the dell is nice, i.g. like I said
as soon as I issue netlabelctl unlbl accept off, those addresses not defined
are simply not allowed.(the problem with the dell is I'm not seeing
any allow rules being generated: i.g.
allow netlabel_peer_t netif_t:netif ingress;
allow netlabel_peer_t node_t:node recvfrom;
allow unlabeled_t netif_t:netif ingress;
allow unlabeled_t node_t:node recvfrom;
The next is a macbookpro ati chipset the kernel is 2.6.29-rc1
the o.s. is ubuntu jaunty, the netlabel_tools is the same as above.
the only results I see out of this is the avc's it's generating
(the allow rules above are from the macbook);
some reason the dell doesn't generate any avc's,
which makes me wonder is this a module issue.
Also I've gone through thinking, well maybe this is avc's driven,
i.g. each address once added by netlabelctl receives a certain allow rule
(like the allow rules above),
if not either no allow rule is given to it,resulting in a denial you 
can't see in dmesg,
or a denial that just won't be allowed by checkpolicy.
So after seeing if this was the case I was left with  an address defined by
netlabel(allowed) and defined the allow rules that it had created.
unfortunately after all of that I still was able to turn on another radio
station  that had  no  address  in netlabelctl's  unlbl database.(and no 
allow rule
with SELinux);
leading me to believe that the netlabel area or driver isn't working
properly. or just told to not enforce the netlabel accept off option.
As for the list, I have linux-wireless in my address book(not sure which 
is right);
