This is in the series of "don't do that" ...
Request originator had edited "From:" address to list address,
and there was no "To:" or "Cc:" header at all.
Overall, any request needing approval from listowner is likely to be
_ignored_.   You do see the amount of traffic in these lists.
From that you can have a vague idea of how much admin junk listowners 
get...
See  
http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html
   for futher guidance.
