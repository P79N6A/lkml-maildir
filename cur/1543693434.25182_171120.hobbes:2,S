It seems that we have a bit of misunderstanding here.
I just don't want to go back to /dev being actually placed on
real, on-disk fs.
I won't mind if naming scheme will change as long
as device names start with '/dev/' and appear
there (semi-)automagically. That's what I call devfs.
If udev can do this, I am all for that.
