I've also lost track of why we don't return -ENODEV from the
arch_init().
We should set -ENODEV after setting ->backtrace as appropriate. Then the
code should do what it used to do:
    138         int err = oprofile_arch_init(&oprofile_ops);
    139
    140         if (err == -ENODEV || timer) {
    141                 timer_init(&oprofile_ops);
    142                 err = 0;
    143         } else if (err) {
    144                 goto out;
    145         }
