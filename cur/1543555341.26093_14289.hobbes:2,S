 It's not legal -- the MPS is very explicit the MP-table must reflect a
real configuration.

 OK, but how does it handle the 82489DX?  There are valid configurations
using this kind of APIC, including Pentium P54C ones...

 Hmm, the only solution I can see is to check the APIC version in the
MP-table and only if an integrated version is reported then check
capabilities.  But can we trust the version reported given that amount of
brokenness out there?
