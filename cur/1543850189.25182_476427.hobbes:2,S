What about current and power? These change very quickly.
BTW, your patch doesn't address the instantaneous vs. average readout
issue in the Smart Battery Data Specification and ThinkPads. Nor a
number of other issues I brought up earlier.

Agreed.

You can't do this conversion, since the voltage is not constant.
Typically the voltage drops when the charge goes down, so you'll be
grossly overestimating the available energy it. And the effect varies
with battery chemistry and condition.
So there's no choice, you must use a generic term + units (and I
suggest following the Smart Battery Data Specification's term
"capacity"). This also takes care of the inevitable hardware that
reports in other units, such as normalized percent.

Then please make space-separated rather than comma-separated. That's
easier to parse in shell and C.
