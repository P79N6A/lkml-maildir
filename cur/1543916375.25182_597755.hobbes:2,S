Yes, you have an 80x34 screen (normal VGA is 80x25). I have received
several reports about this problem (if the kernel boots with an initial
screen which is not 80x25 and the init scripts attempts to set an 8x16
font, the user gets a display that does not fit the screen). Your
problem though is probably unrelated.
