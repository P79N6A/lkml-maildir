No, it's not the root filesystem, but I usually check it while it's
mounted r/o, because the check takes nearly an hour and I want to give
the users at least read access to their files.
But because I assumed that this may cause problems, I did try it with a
completly unmonted filesystem once, without success.
Can you explain how a r/o mounted file system can cause problems?
Perhaps there is still some connection to my problem.
