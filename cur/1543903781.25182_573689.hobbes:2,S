add 'notrace' to the definition of read_tsc in arch/i386/kernel/tsc.c. 
(check recent -rt's read_tsc() definition) (or do echo 1 > 
/proc/sys/kernel/trace_use_raw_cycles - if you are using recent enough 
-rt)

there should be, once you fix read_tsc().

it's not the prctl calls that matter but the fact that every kernel 
function will be traced if you have FUNCTION_TRACING on. It mask any 
races - but latencies are usually not masked (they are enlarged).
