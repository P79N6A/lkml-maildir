I fixed it in slightly different way in ide-dev-2.6 - by calling
ide_end_request() instead of ->end_request().

This change makes *all* taskfile registers to be read on completion
of *any* command.  Currently this is done only for flagged taskfiles
and commands using no-data protocol.
With all your changes it will be also done for:
* HDIO_DRIVE_[TASKFILE,CMD] ioctls
* /proc/ide/hd?/{identify,smart_thresholds,smart_values}
but reading back all registers is not always needed.
It is already bad enough (and we can't fix it cause it is exported
to user-space through HDIO_DRIVE_TASKFILE), we shouldn't
make it worse.
