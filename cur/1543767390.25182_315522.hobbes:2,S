this drive is connected using an adapter that converts an LC/LV (is this 
correct, off the top of my head) interface into a standard SCSI (narrow) 
interface. Could this be HELPING me here?
Probably the opposite, but thats what you meant anyway, right :-
I saw this on two Intel 440LX dual pIII 500/550 mobos, a bit different 
in age and scsi composition.
I didn't install on either, but neither mobos wouldn't recognize _any_ 
disks to better than 20MB/s, if at all, using some unnamed converter.
Same disks (IBM 18G DDYS 10K + 9G DNES 7200) worked just fine with same 
converter and a 29160 controller.
