The locking became finer-grained.
Up to 2.5.31 or thereabouts, invalidate_inode_pages was grabbing
the global pagemap_lru_lock and walking all the inodes pages inside
that lock.  This basically shuts down the entire VM for the whole
operation.
In 2.5.33, that lock is per-zone, and invalidate takes it on a 
much more fine-grained basis.
That all assumes SMP/preempt.  If you're seeing these problems on
uniproc/non-preempt then something fishy may be happening.
But be aware that invalidate_inode_pages has always been best-effort.
If someone is reading, or writing one of those pages then it
certainly will not be removed.  If you need assurances that the
pagecache has been taken down then we'll need something stronger
in there.
