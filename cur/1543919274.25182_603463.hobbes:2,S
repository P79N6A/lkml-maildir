a new Kconfig entry was made CONFIG_SCSI_LOWLEVEL for 2.6.23 (since 
2.6.23-rc7)
Which turns OFF by default all the SCSI drivers, including MEGARAID_SAS.
This was not present previous to 2.6.23-rc9. As a result
a "make oldconfig" will nuke the scsi driver tree.
The default for this Kconfig
in drivers/scsi/Kconfig is wrong. it should default to on.
menuconfig SCSI_LOWLEVEL
        bool "SCSI low-level drivers"
        depends on SCSI!=n
