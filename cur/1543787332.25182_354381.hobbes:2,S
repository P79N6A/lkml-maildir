Just updated my KHGtG to include the latest goodies available in 
git-core, the Linux kernel standard SCM tool:
	
http://linux.yyz.us/git-howto.html
Several changes in git-core have made working with git a lot easier, so 
be sure to re-familiarize yourself with the development process.
Comments, corrections, and notes of omission welcome.  This document 
mainly reflects my typical day-to-day git activities, and may not be 
very applicable outside of kernel work.
