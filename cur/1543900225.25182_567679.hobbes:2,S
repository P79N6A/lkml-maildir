It's FUD. Freezing of tasks normally takes next to no time. I've never 
understood the rediculously long timeout it has. If freezing succeeds, all 
processes are frozen within 1/2 a second tops. If it fails, nothing is going 
to change in the following 19.5 seconds (or whatever it is if I don't 
remember the value properly).
