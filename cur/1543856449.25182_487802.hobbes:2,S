Yes, most filesystems have their own scheme for managing i_ino 
assignment, so this is primarily for "pseudo-filesystems". Stuff like 
pipefs, sockfs, /proc, etc...

I have no problem with someone writing, selling and supporting 
proprietary modules. Knock yourself out. I just don't see a reason why I 
should contribute code to such an effort.
Still though, this was coded in part on company time. I certainly don't 
want to go against Red Hat's policy in such a matter, so I'll do some 
due diligence internally as to how this should be done.
In the meantime, does anyone have objections or comments on this 
approach on technical grounds?
Thanks,
Jeff
