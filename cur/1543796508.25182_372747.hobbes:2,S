Hmm, yes, this will allow some info to be gathered - I'm now running
this, thanks for the pointer.
But, forcing users to install python, twistd, zope interface etc is
not exactely making it simple for people to run (and they have to know
about it first as well).
If this was instead implemented in C and distributed with the kernel
source I think a lot more people would run it and the data gathered
would be a lot more useful.
