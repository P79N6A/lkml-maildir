Yes, you're right, from a stability point of view I was being a bit
impractical.  Any idea how many developers are actually regularly
testing code on 386s these days, by the way?

Yeah, breaking existing code can wait until 2.7 :-).  Putting the
hooks in for future code removal is all we need to do - until somebody
actually feels the need to trim something, it might as well stay.
