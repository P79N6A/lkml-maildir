Hello,
	I've been having some trouble with a starfire I have in that it seems
	to drop packets every once in a while for a little bit and then start
	up again.  Also getting strange kernel messages:
----

	This happens on other interfaces, not just this one.  The kernel being
	used is stock 2.4.6-ac2.  Would the patches you've posted to lkml help?
	If so I can give them a shot...
		Thanks!
