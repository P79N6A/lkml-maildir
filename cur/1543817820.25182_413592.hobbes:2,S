hi all,
i m studying linux-kernel-2.6.16.
i m trying to understand basically how /proc/kcore works. for tht i hv
written a small c code & i hv added printk statments in open_kcore() ,
kclist_add(), get_kcore_size() and in read_kcore() in /proc/kcore.c
file...but after executing my c program it's not printing all printk
statments... after execution it is printing only statment tht i hv
written in kclist_add() function.
please any one can tell why it's not printing all statments in printk???
this the c program tht i hv written for reading /proc/kcore:
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
        FILE *fp;
        char array[10];
        int i=0;
        fp = fopen("/proc/kcore","r");
        if(!fp)
                return 1;
        while(i<10)
        {
                fgets(array,10,fp);
                printf("%s",array);
                i++;
        }
        fclose(fp);
        return 0;
}
thanks,
Priyanka
