 I'm getting it in 2.6.0-test3(-mm1) too. The problem (I think) is 
that the ''if'' is aways true because ''value'' never will be > than
''SIZE(func_table)''.
 
 The cast does not solve the problem, because ''value'' have just
8 bits (unsigned char) used, in other words, with the cast
the ''if'' will continue to be true.
