Wrong.
The "somebody" strongly felt that ide-scsi was not just ugly but _evil_, 
and that the syntax and usage of "cdrecord" was absolutely stupid.
That somebody was me.
ide-scsi has always been broken. You should not use it, and indeed there 
was never any good reason for it existing AT ALL. But because of a broken 
interface to cdrecord, cdrecord historically only wanted to touch SCSI 
devices. Ergo, a silly emulation layer that wasn't really worth it.
The fact that nobody has bothered to fix ide-scsi seems to be a result of 
nobody _wanting_ to really fix it. 
So don't use it. Or if you do use it, send the fixes over.
