Question: how will the extra overhead of checking this configuration
compare with just doing it anyway?
If the code ends up as:
if (stats_enabled)
  counter++;
then you'd be better off keeping stats enabled all the time...
Obviously it'll be a bit more complex, but will the stats code be able to
remove itself completely when disabled, even at runtime??
Might be possible with IBM's dprobes, perhaps...?

NT allows boot-time (en|dis)abling of stats; they quote a percentage for
the performance hit caused - 4%, or something like that?? Of course, they
don't say whether that's a 486 on a RAID array or a quad Xeon on IDE, so
the accuracy of that figure is a bit questionable...
