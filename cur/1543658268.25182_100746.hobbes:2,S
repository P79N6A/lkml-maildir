Ok.  I did some looking into the usb and midi stuff, but it requires 
quite some work for me to find
out what's happening here, so I guess that I will not get very far in 
the near future.
So I installed ALSA, and used the USB/MIDI stuff from within there, and 
everything works fine, it seems, at least with uhci.o.
So I guess there may be something with usb-midi which causes the problem.
Thanks for your reply, anyway.
