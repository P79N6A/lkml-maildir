Thanks for your quick reply, Cristoph.
One more question arises though...

Why would __copy_to_user be a good choice? AFAIK, __copy_to_user does no
validy checks (as opposed to copy_to_user which does access_ok()) so,
considering verify_area() does only some checks, one could argue that
there's even less checking done if using __copy_to_user. Where am I
interpreting this wrong (as I certainly am) ?
Thanks again,
