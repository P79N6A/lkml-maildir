Andrew,
Success :)
I've attached the patches used vs 2.6.17-rc4 (stock) and 2.6.17-rc6-mm2 
(as the VIA include lists were different). I simply made the change 
manually, based on your and others' inputs (it seemed the simpler option).
Both kernels now boot, and all USB devices are recognised correctly.
Sergio, you can find attached lspci -n output as requested, and indeed, 
I run in XT_PIC mode for interrupts.
I did NOT run the setpci command as requested by Sergey, let me know if 
that helps anyone considering the fix sorted this out.
Where to from here I'll leave with you guys, an entry in the quirks.c 
file certainly is warranted for my motherboard...
I'm happy to test further patches if required on this, for now I'm on 
rc6-mm2 with my attached patch to have both ACX111 networking and USB 
working good :)
Cheers!
:)Johny
