SATA controller SII 3512 not recognized by driver. It looks like SII 
3512 is almost identical to 3112 interface. I copy/paste/alterred all 
code in ide/pci/siimage.[ch] with "3112" in it to "3512". It seems about 
95% functional. Need help with remaining 5%, related to very, very, slow 
controller comms during init with occational "Interrupt Lost" messages. 
Seems like comms are out of sync and then resync over and over. Other 
than that all drive info comes over. Ryan Earl's patch may fix, I would 
be suprised if it was that simple though. I will try later today.
