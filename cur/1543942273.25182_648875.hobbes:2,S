Hi all,
Can we be a bit more careful with the ordering of commits, please?
Commit d22a6966b8029913fac37d078ab2403898d94c63 (iommu sg merging: add
accessors for segment_boundary_mask in device_dma_parameters())
introduces the dma_get_seg_boundary accessor which is used in the
*preceding* commits fb3475e9b6bfa666107512fbd6006c26014f04b8 (for
powerpc), and 1b39b077789955c8389488d53d075518fdcd582e and
fde9a1094ddf2892188a8a0eccda527de47cba8e (for x86).
Thus we have another set of commits that will break bisection.  This one
was easily avoidable.
A little more care is needed.
