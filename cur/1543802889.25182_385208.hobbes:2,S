You make a very good point. We have not agreed on the heirarchy and file 
contents, and  we need to do so before continuing.
Some _very rough_ ideas include
/sys/xen/version/{major minor extra version build}
/sys/xen/domain/{dom0 dom1 ... domn} (each domain could be a dir. with 
attributes)
/sys/xen/hypervisor/{scheduler cpu memory}
/sys/xen/migrate/{hosts_to, hosts_from}
These will be text files with simple attrributes. Most will be 
read-only. It is kind of fun to think about creating a domain by doing 
something like
cat $domain_config > /sys/xen/domain/new
but there are some ugly aspects of doing so. Likewise it would be good 
to add a potential migration host by writing an ip address to
/sys/xen/migrate/hosts_to
Again, we need to get this solidified before going further.

Excellent, we will work on doing so.

Make that two of us :)
