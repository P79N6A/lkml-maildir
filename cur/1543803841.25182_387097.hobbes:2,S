Right, but there should be actually no use case where this happens.
For now I prefer to add a 
BUG_ON(base->curr_timer == timer); 
into hrtimer_start to find the real reason.

I don't see how this should happen.
sys_timer_settime()
	timr = lock_timer(timer_id, flag);
Now the k_itimer, which is the container of the hrtimer is locked.
common_timer_set()
	if (hrtimer_try_to_cancel() < 0)
		return TIMER_RETRY;
	....
	hrtimer_start();
	return;
back in sys_timer_settime()
	unlock_timer(timr);
So how gets this timer added back, when the container lock is held
across the complete operation ?

The posix timer code does already the Right Thing, as it uses
hrtimer_try_to_cancel() and reacts on the return value. This is
necessary to prevent a dead lock with the k_itimer lock. 
I try to reproduce this with your test program on my test boxes.
