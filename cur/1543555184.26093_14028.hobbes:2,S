Booting with noapic did not improve anything.
The processor is not supposed to be overclocked. How can I be sure of
that ?
Further investigations showed that the problem will occur only when
Xfree 4.0.1 is running with an smp kenel . Xfree 3.3.6 is ok. Could this
be a bug in X ?  I thought that the kernel should prevent such a bug
from locking the computer.
Thank you again for your help.
