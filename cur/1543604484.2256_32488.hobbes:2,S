I looked a bit deeper. In linux-2.4.10-ac11/drivers/net/eepro100.c:
line 802:
       if ((pdev->device=0x2449) || ( (pdev->device > 0x1030) &&
(pdev->device < 0x1039) )) 
               sp->chip_id = 1;
line 1358:
        /* workaround for hardware bug on 10 mbit half duplex */
        if ((sp->partner==0) && (sp->chip_id==1)) {
                wait_for_cmd_done(ioaddr + SCBCmd);
                outb(0 , ioaddr + SCBCmd);
        }
Maybe we need another device id at line 802? The work-around seems to
stay untriggered this way.
 
My device's id is: 	8086:1229 - Intel, 82557 [Ethernet Pro 100]
The present ids are: 	8086:1030 - 82559 InBusiness 10/100
				8086:1031-1039 - are not listed in my db
				8086:2449 - 82820 820 (Camino 2) Chipset
Ethernet
For one thing, in Linus' 2.4.12 the if condition at line 802 isn't
present at all, so that sure isn't gonna work.
