Subject: Kernel facilities for tracking file accesses

	Does any facility exist in the 2.4 and up kernels for logging *every* open, 
read, write, seek, close, etc call?  I'm trying to debug a problem in a 
package I don't have source to, and I'm trying to prove that it's not 
applying a configuration path option to files it's opening.  
	Ideally, I'd like a kernel module I can load that I can apply a regexp or 
limited pattern matchng to, and will log a selected group of operations as 
defined by a bitmask or other configuration option.  I would prefer something 
that monitors the entire system, rather than trying to sandbox this 
particular program (it runs as a daemon).
	Do the kernels have facilties for such tracking?
