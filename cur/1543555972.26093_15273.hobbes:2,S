Right on! Do you think it would be too big a performance hit if OUT_BYTE
actually was an hwif function call instead of a macro ? OUT_BYTE has more
to do with the specific hw interface than the system architecture, really. 
Actually the entire hwif_unregister function should be handled by the hwif
itself I guess (haven't noticed that yet since I never unregister my
drivers :) 
My "hack" right now involves putting "magic" values in the io_ports array
so that OUT_BYTE separate them correctly (my controller has ONE address
where a 32-bit write does the commands, with a bitfield controlling the
IDE bus address instead of splitting into 7 + 1 separate addresses).
BTW can ide_register_hw be called from the automatic "module_init" chains
during bootup, or is that too early or too late ? It would be nice if that
was the case because otherwise we need to add to the long list in
probe_for_hwifs with initialization calls.
