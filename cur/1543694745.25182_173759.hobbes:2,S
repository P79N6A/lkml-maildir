I meant the interrupt problem, because if that problem exists
there doesn't seem to be a reasonable way to figure out what
is the reason for the filesystem corruption.

Ok, so if I understood you correctly, the interrupt problem
persists _only_ if you leave the multiple sector setting on
its default setting ? If you explicitly disable it, or set
it to maximum it works fine ? Does it work with any value ?

I'd really like to see the stable series working properly
before jumping into the 2.6-series test kernels ... Although,
I'm still wondering how come TCQ is known to work with 370-chip
as Jens said, but not with 374-chip ...
