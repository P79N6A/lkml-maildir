Sorry Frank to write it again to you, but I forgot to echo it to the ml.

Steffen's arguments on that have conviced me. He does not say that
zImage is 'safe', because it runs always everywhere (what it does not),
but that it is 'safe', because you can tell 100% that zImage failed at
compile time.
You can have the output of make zImage piped through grep "kernel too
big" or whatevr it says and then promt the user:
Hi $USER!
I've just encountered that my first attempt to compile your kernel
failed, because I thought it not to be so big. This is nothing to worry
about, in fact, with recent kernels this is quite normal. I'll rerun the
compilation for you.
Have patience :-)
                   Yours, $0.
