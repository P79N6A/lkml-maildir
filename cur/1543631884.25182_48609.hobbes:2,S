Well, as i read the ide .c i see that preconfigureation (if you can call
it that, more like what drives/interfaces do we assume is there), i only
see that for ide0-3. Now ide0-1 is onboard and ide1-2 is the first ide
card but nothing is made with ide4-5 which is the second ide card and i
think that the problem.
It would realy be nice to find a way to force transfer mode on boot up but
i cant see to find any way.
