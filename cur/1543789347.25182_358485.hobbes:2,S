Can you try it with rcupdate.maxbatch set to 10000 in boot
command line ?
FWIW, the open/close test problem goes away if I set maxbatch to
10000. I had introduced this limit some time ago to curtail
the effect long running softirq handlers have on scheduling
latencies, which now conflicts with OOM avoidance requirements.
