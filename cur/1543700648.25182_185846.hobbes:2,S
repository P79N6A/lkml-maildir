Testing ACPI sleep under 2.6, I noticed the following issues
(Thinkpad T40, i855PM chipset):
- USB fails on resume (sent to linux-usb-devel)
- DRI being loaded at all causes X to fail on resume
- MCE on resume:
 MCE: The hardware reports a non fatal, correctable incident occurred on CPU 0.
 Bank 1: f200000000000175
 
Are these known issues, or 'features' of suspend on this ACPI
bios?
