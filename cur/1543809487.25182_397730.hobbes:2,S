We actually do honor a max_pid > 32K but only if we are 64bit.
We need to fix /proc and resolve the issue that 32K pids takes about 320M
of RAM.  Which is 1/2 to 1/3 of all of low memory, on a 32bit box, if
we want a hight max_pid than 32K.  Of course 32K is also a very nice
number for the pid bitmap allocator as it is only 1 page.
With about 80K task structures+stack the machine goes 00M, because you
have exhausted all of low memory.
