Yes. Though it might need a few more primitives to fully realize its
usefulness. My tinkering to make it more flexible isn't getting anywhere -
I wrote a find_resource to either find a resource or find its tree
insertion point, which is now the core of __request_resource. However,
because the list of siblings is singly-linked, it ended up taking a struct
resource ***. Too sick to live.
Linus, would you consider a patch to make resource siblings doubly-linked?
We could then use the list macros and avoid the pointer to a pointer stuff
in the current code. Alternately, a tree.h might not be a bad idea.

No, they remain the same. My patch makes those two thin wrappers around a
generic register_dev function just like your patch does. All my new
functions take a kdev_t and a device type (block/char). I'd like a future
kdev_t to include a bit indicating type, which would make this even
cleaner. Block and char devices work more or less identically from the pov
of most of the kernel.
