I thought that later generation CPUs were supposed to have lower
memory bandwidth relative to the CPU core, so CPU operations are
better than copying.  Hence all the fancy special memory instructions,
to work around that.
Not that it matters.  I think the 366 Celeron is typical of a lot of
computers being used today.  I still use it every day, after all.
