I tend to agree. OTOH, I use exactly such setups... ;->

I checked, it was in fact during the lockless loopback
optimizations.

Let me first check and see how the locking can be done at best, it
doesn't match the principles in sch_generic.c anyway at the moment
so once we know how to do the locking efficient and how to remove the
error proneess we can see if the optimization fits in without problems
and make a call.
