I've respun the non sas_ata patches from last week against scsi-misc:
http://sweaglesw.net/~djwong/docs/libsas-patches/
 .  The *jejb*patch
files are pulled from aic94xx-sas, so I suppose it's not quite a pure
rebasing; however, some of those patches don't really make any sense
without those three included.
