Replying to myself....  Anyway, I realized that even my idea above is
wrong.  I don't see _any_ safe way to share a cache line between a DMA
buffer and other data.  Access to the cache line might pull the cache
line back in and write it back at any time, which could corrupt the
DMA'ed data.  I don't see a way to hide the existence of cache lines
etc. from the driver.
Best,
  Roland
