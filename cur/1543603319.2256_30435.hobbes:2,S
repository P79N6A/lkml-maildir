Well, it's an error, but it's an error in that LVM invalidates the block
devices a bit too much, and the message really tells you that the code
refused to invalidate stuff that must not be invalidated.
It's harmless, although I hope that the LVM people will become a bit
less invalidation-happy as a result of the warning (it's always happened
before, it just hasn't warned about it in earlier kernels).
