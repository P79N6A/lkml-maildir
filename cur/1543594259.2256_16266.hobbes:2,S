Yup, fbcon is what I have in mind here

Well... that would work for VGA itself (note that this semaphore
you are talking about should be shared some way with the /proc
interface so XFree can be properly sync'ed as well).
But I still think it may be useful to generalize the idea to 
all kind of legacy IO & PIOs. I definitely agree that VGA is a kind
of special case, mostly because of the necessary exclusion on
the VGA IO response.
But what about all those legacy drivers that will issue inx/outx
calls without an ioremap ? Should they call ioremap with hard-coded
legacy addresses ? There are chipsets containing things like legacy
timers, legacy keyboard controllers, etc... and in some (rare I admit)
cases, those may be scattered (or multiplied) on various domains. 
If we decide we don't handle those, then well, I won't argue more
(it's mostly an estethic rant on my side ;), but the problem of
wether they should call ioremap or not is there, and since the
ISA bus can be "mapped" anywhere in the bus space by the host bridge,
there need to be a way to retreive the ISA resources in general for
a given domain.
That's why I'd suggest something like 
pci_get_isa_mem(struct resource* isa_mem);
pci_get_isa_io(struct resource* isa_io);
(I prefer 2 different functions as some platforms like powermac just
don't provide the ISA mem space at all, there's no way to generate
a memory cycle in the low-address range on the PCI bus of those and
they don't have a PCI<->ISA bridge), so I like having the ability of
one of the functions returning an error and not the other.
Also, having the same ioremap() call for both mem IO and PIO means
that things like 0xc0000 cannot be interpreted. It's a valid ISA-mem
address in the VGA space and a valid PIO address on a PCI bus that
supports >64k of PIO space.
I beleive it would make things clearer (and probably implementation
simpler) to separate ioremap and pioremap.
Ben.
