OEM vs Compatible vs Remanufactured
************************************************
OEM Cartridges
=============
New OEM cartridges carry the brand name of your printer manufacturer and are sold new cartridges. But read the fine print on their box and you will see that your toner cartridge was made with new and recycled parts. And then take a peek at the price tag for your OEM cartridge!
Compatible Cartridges
=================
Our new compatible cartridges are sold as new cartridges and are produced by a manufacturer other than your printer manufacturer and like the OEM, are manufactured with new and recycled parts. Our new premium compatibles are produced under stringent quality controls and are built to meet or exceed your OEM's specifications. This means simply that our new compatibles deliver the highest quality print as well as the longest possible life and at a fraction of the cost of an OEM.
Remanufactured Cartridges
======================
Our factory remanufactured cartridges are produced using only cartridges that have never been refilled. They are filled to capacity with the same high quality inks the OEM's use. These cartridges are produced with confidence and are strictly monitored for quality control. Our premium cartridges deliver the highest quality prints and the longest possible life due to being refilled to capacity. And check out our savings!
