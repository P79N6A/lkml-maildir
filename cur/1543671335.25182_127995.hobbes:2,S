Sorry, again me :-(
Playing aroung with the mouse, I've got the following error:
usb 1-1: USB disconnect, address 2
drivers/usb/host/uhci-hcd.c: 8800: host controller halted. very bad
                                                           ^^^^^^^^
hub 1-0:0: debounce: port 1: delay 100ms stable 4 status 0x301
...
The USB didn't wok anymore, then I stopped hotplug and the system died 
just after the message "Stopping hotplug subsystem" appeared in the 
konsole.
It's the same Dell Latitude X200.
BTW, the usb mouse doesn't work with ohci, altough the modules are loaded.
Also, the previously reported "psmouse.c: Lost synchronization" errors 
disappear by using /dev/input/mouse[01] instead of /dev/psaux and 
/dev/input/mice.
