Sure, it'll be there either way ;)

Grin, when the pain of typing cd subvol is btrfs' biggest worry, I'll be
doing very well.

Right about here is where I would insert a long story about ecryptfs, or
encryption solutions that happen all in userland.  At any rate, it is
outside the scope of v1.0, even though I definitely agree it is an
important problem for some people.

This would be a snapshot, which has to be done on a subvolume right now.
It is not as nice as being able to pick a random directory, but I've
only been able to get this far by limiting the feature scope
significantly.  What I did do was make subvolumes very cheap...just make
a bunch of them.
Keep in mind that if you implement a cow directory tree without a
snapshot, and you don't want to duplicate any blocks in the cow, you're
going to have fun with inode numbers.
