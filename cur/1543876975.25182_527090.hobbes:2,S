Yes, I love this approach too.

Some things will go faster (no longer needing a separate COW fault
on the read-protected ZERO_PAGE), some things will go slower and use
more memory.  The open question is whether anyone will notice those
regressions: I'm hoping they won't, I'm afraid they will.  And though
we'll see each as a program doing "something stupid", as in the Altix
case Robin showed to drive us here, we cannot just ignore it.

I'd like you to: I didn't study the fragment below, it's really all
uses of the ZERO_PAGE that I'd like to see go, then we see who shouts.
It's quite likely that the patch would have to be reverted: don't
bother to remove the allocations of ZERO_PAGE in each architecture
at this stage, too much nuisance going back and forth on those.
Leave ZERO_PAGE as configurable, default off for testing, buried
somewhere like under EMBEDDED?  It's much more attractive just to
remove the old code, and reintroduce it if there's a demand; but
leaving it under config would make it easy to restore, and if
there's trouble with removing ZERO_PAGE, we might later choose
to disable it at the high end but enable it at the low.  What
would you prefer?
