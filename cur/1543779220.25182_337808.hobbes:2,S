> It would be nice to set MAX_LINKS to 64 and close this issue for now,
James and Dmitry, increasing MAX_LINKS does't work, did you actually
try to open a netlink socket with a protocol number larger than 32?
It will not work.  Don't you think I'd implement such a simple fix to
expand the protocol number space if it was that easy? :-)
You can't increase MAX_LINKS past 32 because this is also the value of
NPROTO.  It is impossible to create a new socket with a protocol value
larger than NPROTO, and this value is exported into userspace as well.
