Someone has a "/" in their device name string (sound/pci/emu10k1/emu10k1.c):
static struct pci_driver driver = {
        .name = "EMU10K1/Audigy",
        .id_table = snd_emu10k1_ids,
        .probe = snd_card_emu10k1_probe,
        .remove = __devexit_p(snd_card_emu10k1_remove),
};
and "/" is, of course, the path separator.  Change the "/" to "_" or some
other character and it'll work.
