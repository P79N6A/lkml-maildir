Well, it is probably not going into -mm before your changes are in
mainline. That means 2.6.17 earliest.

Of course I'm going to fix up breakage before the merge. At least all
the kernel parts and enough userland to test that it still works.

Well, I'm trying to gently push you. I'd like to get some solution in
1-2 months timeframe, so that work on userland parts can start.
