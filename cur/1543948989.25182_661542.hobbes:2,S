I was thinking like Alan when I was writing pcim_request_regions() but I
agree reserving all the regions does avoid certain problems.  Especially
true for controller which duals as native SATA and compatible SFF
controller like ICH AHCIs.  ata_generic or ide generic might attach to a
controller which is already being driven by ahci under certain
configurations.
Please note that pcim_request_regions() is a helper to do
pci_request_region() calls and pcim_iomap() in one go.  Drivers which
have different requirements can just open code pci_request_regions() and
pcim_iomap().  pcim_request_regions() should provide sensible default
behavior for common cases.
I think the best solution is to allow duplicate request regions for
managed devices which is okay as we know we're holding the resource and
let drivers which need to reserve all regions call pci_request_regions()
before calling pcim_request_regions().
How does it sound?
Thanks.
