In the kernel build area a few possible projects exists.
Increase speed for a build with no updates
==========================================
On a resonably fast machine with a decent config it takes
roughly 10 seconds to do a make where nothing is updated.
Generating one single Makefile is assumed to speed up things
and will in addition allow a simpler syntax as what is used today
for some of the uglier constructs.

Difficulty: 5
Language: Perl or C
Increase speed for a build wich updates a single file
=====================================================
We often edit a single file and then do a build.
And the result is that we spend 80% of the time linking
the kernel.
So an obvious improvement for the kernel community would
be to improve the speed of the linker (and decrease memory footprint).

Difficulty: ?
Language: C
Update menuconfig to a modern ncurses look&feel
===============================================
htop, aptitude, tig and other ncurses based programs has
a more modern and effective look&feel than current menuconfig.
Rip out all the lxdialog stuff and replace it with a ncurses
based frontend that looks better and has more functionality.

They are independent but challenging and would be very much appreciated
by the kernel community.
I could come up with more projects but these are the ones that are most
straightforward to start with.
