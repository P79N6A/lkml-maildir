Agreed.  One thought that occurred to me as I was tucking in my kids
(yeah, sick that I think about this crap that much) was that both Richard
and I are very convinced that what we are doing is good for the community.
We have opposing views on how to do it (in this case) but it is worth
remembering that we are both trying to help as best we are able.
The flame wars are inevitable when you get two strong willed people both
trying to do the right thing in opposite ways, it's no surprise, or it
shouldn't be.  But the thought I had was that it was worth remembering
that Richard is trying to do the right thing for you and so am I.
He's not the enemy, he's a friend.  
We really ought to be able to be a lot more reasonable about all this
stuff, we all have the same goals, we are all trying to make the world a
better place (swell of violin music as I puke on myself for throwing out
cliches :)  More seriously, my view is that if we're fighting amongst
ourselves, we blew it.  We should be fighting Microsoft, they are the
real problem, Richard isn't, the GPL isn't, BK isn't.  Let's keep our
eye on the ball.
I'm off to watch some hockey, which is even more fun than this, amazingly
enough...  You can take the boy out of Wisconsin, but you can't take
Wisconsin out of the boy.
