It's almost impossible to get READA to do anything.  For example, in
current 2.5, if a READA attempt is actually aborted, end_buffer_io_sync
reports a "buffer I/O error".  Every time. And nobody has reported this.
It _is_ possible to hit this in 2.5, because of ext2_preread_inode().
Probably, also it's possible to hit it in 2.4 with hundreds of processes
all issuing ext3 directory readahead.  But it's pretty remote.
