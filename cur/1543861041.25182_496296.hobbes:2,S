Ordinarily I'd say no wucking fay, but that's effectively what we've been
doing in there for ages, and it seems to work.
I'd be a bit worried if any of these functions were returning pointers,
because one could certainly conceive of an arch+compiler combo which
returns pointers in a different register from integers (680x0?) but that's
not happening here.

Yeah, that should all be OK.
