i think Lee is well aware of that - nevertheless his data point shows
that even the relatively low number of latency fixes that went into
2.6.10 (compared to what is pending in -mm and in -RT) are a step in the
right direction. I'd guess the biggest win was the ACPI related latency
fix, and maybe the softirq fixes.
