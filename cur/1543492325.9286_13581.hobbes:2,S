Summary:
Complete and sudden lockup while running 2.2.5, after relatively little uptime.
Symptoms:
As I was moving the mouse in X11, the system froze completely at 1999-04-08
18:23:28 Eastern Time.  There was no disk activity at or after the freeze. I
was unable to switch to any other console.  Keyboard lights did not respond.
On rebooting, fsck found no inconsistencies in any filesystems (probably the
first time I've ever seen that happen).  There was nothing in
/var/log/messages immediately preceding the crash.  The system had been up
since 02:51:37 the same day.  (15 hours, 31 minutes, 51 seconds.)
