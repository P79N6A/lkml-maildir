How so? The XAPIC version check should work there.
The problem on AMD happens because it reports an old APIC version.

it has been suggested to merge it with bigsmp because the setup
should work on Intel too.

I fixed that in the 64bit version already, but not in 32bit yet.
Yes, the value of the APIC IDs must be used as indicator.
