I have a patch dated Jan 14 17:09:06 2001. Does that match any of
yours?
  diff -rNu --exclude-from=exclude linux-2.4.vanilla/drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c linux-2.4/drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c
  --- linux-2.4.vanilla/drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c     Sun Jan 14 17:09:06

Let me have your patch anyway. I want to examine the supermount
patches. I'll send you the one I have if you want it.
