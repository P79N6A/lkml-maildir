Damn. I should reread my mail before sending them.

This one is wrong.
do_pollfd calls f_ops->poll() [yes to the first part], but the driver
should not call schedule() [no to the second part], it should avoid it
whereever possible. It might happen that it sleeps, but the
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE has nothing to do with that sleeping.
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE is required for the Linux wait queue implementation,
as explained in Alan's mouse driver article.
If the driver must sleep, then someone must reset current->state to
TASK_RUNNING before sleeping: a driver calls
poll_wait()->__pollwait()->kmalloc()->...->try_to_free_pages()
and try_to_free_pages will resets current->state.
Sorry for the confusion,
	Manfred
