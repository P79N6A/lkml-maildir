    Thank you!  I've been wanting this for ever so long.  I was about to
    complain that I'd never seen it documented, but man 1 mount does indeed
    document -L and -U switches for these.
    However, man fstab doesn't show any such options, and still claims to be
    for Linux 0.99 from 1993.  Where do I get the updated page?
Ask and thou shalt receive.

       The  first  field,  (fs_spec), describes the block special
       device or remote filesystem to be mounted.
       For ordinary mounts it will hold (a link to) a block  spe-
       cial  device  node (as created by mknod(8)) for the device
       to be mounted, like `/dev/cdrom' or `/dev/sdb7'.  For  NFS
       mounts one will have <host>:<dir>, e.g., `knuth.aeb.nl:/'.
       For procfs, use `proc'.
       Instead of giving the device explicitly, one may  indicate
       the (ext2) filesystem that is to be mounted by its UUID or
       volume label (cf.  e2label(8)), writing  LABEL=<label>  or
       UUID=<uuid>,  e.g.,  `LABEL=Boot'  or `UUID=3e6be9de-8139-
       -11d1-9106-a43f08d823a6'.  This will make the system  more
       robust:  adding  or  removing a SCSI disk changes the disk
       device name but not the filesystem volume label.
...
(fstab.5 from the not-yet-released util-linux-2.9t).
    The addition of these features should have been announced with much
    fanfare.  Did I miss something?
Well, when I added it to 2.1.116 this was just some development
kernel that not so many people used. And these kernels had all
kinds of obscure problems - not the right time to tell everybody
to start using them. Now with 2.2 this is an option that is
available. Still, only mount knows about it - it will have to be
integrated more fully before we can be completely happy.
