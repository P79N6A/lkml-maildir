Whether this a problem in light of Xen spurious faults depends on whether
NMI handlers touch dynamically-allocated data. And if they do, it still
depends on the exact scenario. If it is likely to be a problem, a Xen pv_op
can flush the TLB on NMI entry, or we could have Xen do that implicitly
before invoking the guest NMI handler.
Currently Xen guests do not use NMI for watchdog or oprofile, so that rather
limits the scope for problems.
