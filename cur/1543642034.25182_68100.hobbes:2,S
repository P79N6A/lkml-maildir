The thing is that the patch in question wants to print a "sector_t",
not a "__u64".
sector_t can be u32 (on 32 bit machines that don't need big devices
and don't want the performance hit) or can be u64 (elsewhere).  
And isn't saying "long long is 64bits" just as bad as all the
pre-alpha code that thought "long" was 32 bits, or the PDP code that
knew that "int" was 16 bits?
