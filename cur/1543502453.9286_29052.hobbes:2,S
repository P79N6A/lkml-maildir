Hi there.
Apparently, the drivers for the IOMEGA ZipDrive do not compile in
kernel 2.3.10 - here's the report I get...
make -C scsi modules
make[2]: Entering directory `/usr/src/linux-2.3.10/drivers/scsi'
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.3.10/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -fno-strength-reduce -DCPU=586 -DMODULE -DMODVERSIONS -include /usr/src/linux-2.3.10/include/linux/modversions.h   -c -o imm.o imm.c
imm.c: In function `imm_detect':
imm.c:169: `PARPORT_MODE_PCPS2' undeclared (first use in this function)
imm.c:169: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
imm.c:169: for each function it appears in.)
imm.c:172: `PARPORT_MODE_PCECPPS2' undeclared (first use in this function)
imm.c:176: `PARPORT_MODE_PCECPEPP' undeclared (first use in this function)
make[2]: *** [imm.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.3.10/drivers/scsi'
make[1]: *** [_modsubdir_scsi] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.3.10/drivers'
make: *** [_mod_drivers] Error 2
Is this connected with the changes that broke the FAT filesystem,
amongst others?
Best wishes from Riley.
