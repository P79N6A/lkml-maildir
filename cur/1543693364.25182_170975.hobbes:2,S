What about shared mappings (that test should be VM_MAYSHARE)?
My inclination would be to not dump them if they are backed by a file, 
even if the mmap is writable.
Also, the VM_WRITE test should possibly be VM_MAYWRITE, since the thing
could have been mprotect()'ed. Alternatively, we could really add a "this
mapping has been writable" flag (a kind of "sticky VM_WRITE" bit). It's
only mprotect that can do this, anyway.
Ehh?
Which would make the logic be something like
	/* Do not dump I/O mapped devices! -DaveM */
	if (vma->vm_flags & VM_IO)
		return 0;
	/* file-backed mapping? */
	if (vma->vm_file) {
		if (vma->vm_flags & VM_MAYSHARE)
			return 0;
		if (!(vma->vm_flags & VM_MAYWRITE))
			return 0;
	}
	return 1;
Hmm?
