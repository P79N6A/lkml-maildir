Subject: sg.c/IrDA in 2.3.43: compile fails

I get this while compiling the 2.3.43 kernel (2.3.42 compiled fine):
-----------

I notice that CONFIG_SD_EXTRA_DEVS is the broken #define, and I need it
for my cd writer (via SCSI emulation). linux/drivers/scsi/Config.in seems
to define this only when the SCSI disk support is set to Yes or Module,
even though I got no SCSI disk inside my computer.
Actually, sg.c DOES compile when SCSI Disk support is activated.
The IrDA subsystem seems to be a source of compile failures too:

-----------
It seems a major rewrite is in the works here.
