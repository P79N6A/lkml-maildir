I was under the impression ntp type of thing was stuffed for the
present under linux anyhow...
I have several machines here, most 2.0.36 and some 2.1.x and _none_
of them stay in sync. for more than a couple of days (a week at
most), many loose sync. three times a days...
Am I doing something silly?
(Almost all UP boxes, xntp3-5.91.tar.gz on some machines,
xntp3-doc_5.93-2.deb on the rest).
