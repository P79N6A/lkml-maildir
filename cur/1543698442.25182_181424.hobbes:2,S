 says so.
Yes, but 'make bzdisk' was reimplemented to use a proper bootloader:
syslinux. You'll need mtools and syslinux-2.06 or later.
I'm also using this approach with 2.4 kernels now, since it eliminates
the annoying kernel size limitation of the old built-in loader.

Straight copy won't work any more, that's a README bug.
