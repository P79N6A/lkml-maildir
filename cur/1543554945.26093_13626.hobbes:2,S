Yes.  I've taken out the detection heuristics for bt848 cards.  The code
is very old, from the days where only 2-3 different bt848 cards where
available.  It simply did'nt work correctly and often used to misdetect
random bt848 cards as either MIRO or Hauppauge (which where the first
available cards).

Only bt878 chips have a subsystem ID.  The bt848 has not.  That's why
there is simply no _reliable_ way to detect bt848 based cards.
