It's still maintained in a sporadic sort of way --- I update it when
either I need it for something, or someone's downloaded it and asks
why it doesn't work agains kernel X.Y.Z.  I see a few downloads a
month.
My microstate accounting patch overlaps the delay accounting patch quite a
lot in functionality, (but I thnk mine is cleaner except for interrupt
time accounting... which the delay accounting patch doesn't do.  I
wanted to know how much time a thread *really* had on the processor,
subtracting off the time spent in interrupt handlers for some other
process).
