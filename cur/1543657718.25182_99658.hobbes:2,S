Another Christmas present. I'd just like to thank you for the work you
have done on making the options make sense.
I haven't tried the mods to PCMCIA yet, but I certainly would like to stop
chasing through other menus to turn on the drivers I need. Repeat thought
for USB.
Now if there was a way to symbolic link to required options, so instead of
being told you can't config USB this-n-that because you didn't find human
interface whatever, you could click into the menu to turn on the whatever
and pop back to what you really wanted to do. Yes, this is definitely 2.7
material (if at all) because someone will create either a loop or
recursion, but I can dream, right?
