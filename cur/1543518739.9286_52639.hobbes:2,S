I use Linux 2.2.12 and keep getting "hdc: lost interrupt" when I use
`cdda2wav' _after_ first having used my CD-ROM-drive for audio-CD
playback.
Even if I exit all other CD-ROM-accessing processes and also open and
close the tray (for the purpose of possibly resetting some kernel IDE
registers) prior to starting up cdda2wav, the same thing happens.
* cdda2wav "hangs" immediately after startup as soon as the drive
  has spun up.
* "hdc: lost interrupt" occurs and repeats with a 10 sec. interval on
  active console and in log.
* The HDD-activity-LED stays illuminated.
* The CD-ROM-drive keeps spinning, with its tray locked (no response on
  eject-button), but its activity-LED is not illuminated.
* The cdda2wav process sleeps uninterruptibly in "down_failed", as
  do other CD-ROM-accessing processes (either started up before or
  after the malfunction). None of these processes die on SIGKILL.
* System load stabilizes around 1 when the system is otherwise idle,
  or 2 or more if other processes are sleeping uninterruptibly as
  well. CPU-utilization remains normal (~98% idle as reported by top).
I have no problem using cdda2wav as long as I have not done audio-CD
playback first. Doing audio-CD playback after successful use of
cdda2wav is neither a problem (but then again cdda2wav does not work
after that).
I also tried 2.2.13 in the hope that the patches in
drivers/block/ide-cd.[ch] and drivers/block/ide.c (some 200 lines away
from where the "lost interrupt" message is produced) would do the
thing, but it did not help.
My machine is a Pentium 200 MMX with 64 MB RAM, a SAMSUNG "24XMax"
CD-ROM-drive, and Creative SB AWE64 soundcard.
cdda2wav is version 1.0-i686-pc-linux-gnu

Reading /proc/ide/ide1/hdc/identify caused another uninterruptible
sleep, and now (after having performed yet another boot) I realize
that it is probably uninteresting anyway.
I guess I could do some more testing with different parameters, but it
is a bit annoying having to boot (and fsck /home which is not
unmounted on shutdown due to (I guess) unkillable processes having
locks on it) between every test.
It seems to me as if this malfunction is partly caused by the specific
behavior of my CD-ROM-drive as this does not happen on my sister's
machine with a pretty modern DVD-capable drive. But unless my drive is
irreconcilably strange or I have somehow misconfigured my kernel (or
BIOS) severely, I guess this is something that should be looked into.
Hope someone has a clue as to how this could be fixed.
Sincerely,
Knut Aksel Røysland
