Thank you all for your suggestions, i found this very entertaining, lot
of laughs i must say. Also the ammount of 'shit' and 'fuck' words totally
blew me off :)
I think i'll put on my t-shirt:
- panic()
- risc logos (on the sides)
- printer "on fire" line (btw. 2.4.20 doesn't have "on fire", just:
  "unknown error", 2.5.54 has it in drivers/usb/class/usblp.c)
- the elegant idle routine - also nice to have. maybe on the back
I'll look also through William's suggestions.
Thank you all very much.
Have a really nice day.
