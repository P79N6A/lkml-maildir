Sorry for the delay!
I run two rounds of oprofile on the context based method, which is the user of
radix_tree_lookup_{head,tail}, which take advantage of the look-aside cache.
This is the diffprofile grep output(disable vs. enable cache):
radixtree-lookaside-cache.diffprofile1:        -8   -53.3% radix_tree_lookup_head
radixtree-lookaside-cache.diffprofile1:       -30    -7.8% radix_tree_lookup_node
radixtree-lookaside-cache.diffprofile1:       -34   -18.9% radix_tree_insert
radixtree-lookaside-cache.diffprofile2:        16    10.9% radix_tree_insert
radixtree-lookaside-cache.diffprofile2:        12    18.8% radix_tree_preload
radixtree-lookaside-cache.diffprofile2:         6    42.9% radix_tree_lookup_tail
radixtree-lookaside-cache.diffprofile2:        -7   -63.6% radix_tree_lookup_head
radixtree-lookaside-cache.diffprofile2:       -23   -10.5% radix_tree_delete
radixtree-lookaside-cache.diffprofile2:       -29    -6.9% radix_tree_lookup_node

Wu
