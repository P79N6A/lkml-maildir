Actually the *predefines line is special.  The driver program will go through
and any -D<name> options will also do -D__<name>__ and -D__<name>.  The ISO C
rules require that no name in the user's namespace be defined at the time of
compilation, so if you use -ansi, the -D<name> is not passed to the
preprocessor.  Thus it is never a good idea to use:
	#ifdef linux
You should instead use:
	#ifdef __linux__

GCC provides stddef.h.  Look in:
	/usr/lib/gcc-lib/*/*/include/
