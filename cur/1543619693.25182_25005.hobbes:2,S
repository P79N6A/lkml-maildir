This is really perverse, but here is why that doesn't work:
module not loaded
      INCREF(module); /* this fails, no module loaded*/
interrupt, blah, blah, blah
now module is loaded by insmod or something
      module = ieee1394_chardevs[blocknum].module;
module now set, but no refcnt bump has been done because it's newly loaded.
module removed
try to set something which went with the module
*BAM*
So, instead, we used try_mod_inc_count() instead of the local INCREF()
#define and return failure if try_mod_inc_count() fails.  Thanks to
Keith Ownens for pointing me to try_mod_inc_count().
