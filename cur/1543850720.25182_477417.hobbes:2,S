 What's the intent of this; just to allow tickless? Or is it also to
make the i8042 driver less racy? I ask because I've applied this over
(a modified) 2.6.18 on my Compaq Presario X1010us laptop which has
been driving me crazy w/ Synaptics problems and keyboard problems
(intermittent, but   frequent enough lately that I finally figured I
needed to do something about it).
If removing raciness is part of the goal, isn't the window in
i8042_aux_write still a problem?
	if (port->mux == -1)
		retval = i8042_command(&c, I8042_CMD_AUX_SEND);
	else
		retval = i8042_command(&c, I8042_CMD_MUX_SEND + port->mux);
        /* i8042_command has re-enabled interrupts;
           what happens if real interrupt happens here, before we call
the ISR ourselves? */
	i8042_interrupt(0, NULL, NULL);
	return retval;
}
I don't really know if or how much the races in this driver are
contributing to my problems (keyboard getting stuck repeating last
key, or ignoring interrupts, or synaptics touchpad freezing, last of
which requires cold boot to fix). Maybe more likely an ACPI thing?
Anyway, thought I'd point this out and see if this patch is actually
going in someone's queue. I think I'll keep running w/ the patch since
w/ the polling in there and HZ set to 1000, it seemed like there were
an awful lot of opportunities for the driver to get confused, and even
if it's not causing my problems it doesn't seem like it could be
helping.
