I duplicated this on 2.5.37-bk as well as 2.5.38-bk.  Maybe we have an 
off-by-one error?  I see the following under 2.5.38-bk:
[tmolina@dad boot]$ dd if=bzImage of=/dev/fd0
dd: writing to `/dev/fd0': No space left on device
5+0 records in
4+0 records out
If I repeate the command I get lines of the 
blk: request botched messages with the following flashed briefly on the 
screen (I wouldn't have seen it if I weren't looking for it):
dd: writing to `/dev/fd0': No space left on device
1441+0 records in
1440+0 records out
