	In case you've missed it: I *don't* change the namespace stuff in
VFAT anymore ;-) 'Nuff. If somebody wants to control the shortnames - may
them care about it.

	Puhlease. First of all, AFFS is broken by design even worse than FAT.
Ditto for HFS, BTW. If you are reluctant to use VFAT as root - great. It
shouldn't be used that way. It is not case-sensitive, it has all sorts of
braindead limitations on names, doesn't support UIDs, lacks file permissions,
etc. What's the point? You can't have the whole thing on VFAT anyway. And
loopback mounting is going to suck, *especially* over *FAT - slow random
access is a bitch. It may be good for feature list, but for anything else?
Unlikely... For what I care *FAT, AFFS, HFS and probably HPFS and NTFS are
compatibility-only beasts. I.e. you may want to use them if you must share
data. You can't use them to keep the whole tree - case-sensitivity is a
must-have for any UNIX. As soon as you need the separate partition you may
use it for root too. initrd works fine for booting, so... what's the
point?
