I agree it'd be a lot simpler to handle 32bit user on 64bit kernel if we
can clear it unconditionally (otherwise we've to trap getfl with a
ia32 wrapper) but I'm afraid the api may break if we clear that bit
unconditionally. I can't tell you for sure by memory though because the
last time I worked on this was one year and half ago and this is really
a matter of API. We should ask the glibc people for another confirmation
before choosing if to clear it only in 64bit archs or in 32bit too.
