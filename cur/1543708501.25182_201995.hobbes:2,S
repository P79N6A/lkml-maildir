No, I think you are confused.  The only thing that has to be unique in
the kobject/device name is it must be unique for the bus it is on.
So for PCI we encode the domain and bus id into .bus_id as we know it
will be unique on this system.  There is no "coincidence" involved at
all.  Same thing with USB, and all other busses.  You only have to be
unique for your specific bus.
So for this bus, that is all that is needed.  You don't have to worry
about the PCI/USB/FooBUS namespace at all.

Why not?  We do it for every other bus type.

Exactly, it is redundant.  That's why you don't need the "vio:" portion.
Does this help out?
