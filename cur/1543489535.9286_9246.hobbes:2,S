This is perhaps not a kernel issue. It may well be related to other
things, but I have run out of places to look.
I upgraded a RH5.2 installation on an HP Omnibook 800CT (which was working
fine with 2.0.36). I decided to upgrade to kernel version 2.2.2 (then I
tried 2.2.1 and at last, 2.2.3).
I have tried using kernels with and _without_ APM in all cases.
The following problem occurs _after_ the machine boots. I.e. when the
login: prompt appears.
The keyboard goes dead (seemingly), but the machine is alive and in
multi-user mode (i.e. it is possible to log in to the machine from the
network).
Typing anything on the keyboard doesn't disappear, however. It buffers the
input, and after hitting the On/Off button (suspend/resume), all the
characters are flushed to the console, and appear on the screen.
If anyone else knows about this problem (some of you might, because I've
been mumbling about it on LinuxNet for a few days now ... sorry), and can
give me some pointers, I'd be most appreciative.
Thanks,
Tor.
