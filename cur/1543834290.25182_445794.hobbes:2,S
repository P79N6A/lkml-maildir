You are right. Will remove it.
Just remembered one of reasons I had version-check before, how about linux 2.4?
What I understand, they have the same drivers as 2.6 but they have not commited
to use gcc >= 3. Can anyone confirm or deny this? Otherwise the discussion about
alternetiv bool-type is off no relevence anymore.
