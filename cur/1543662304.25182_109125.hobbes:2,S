Hi,
I'm the leader of a project, developping a sandbox (processes confinement environment) for Linux based on LSM.
Our approach is dedicated for peer-to-peer global computing environments. I totally agree with Makan about the
diversity of developpement : we dont have the same goals than SELinux. The LSM project followed two phases :
in a first one, everybody was thinking about what could be good to integrate in LSM and now (the second phase),
a few people think about what they can remove because they dont use it. We need a flexible and reasonably complete
framework to implement solutions. I recall that it was the original request from Linus : a generic framework to decide
which kind of security solutions are the best. If LSM fits only one or two policy requirements, the choice does not
exist. For finishing : PLEASE, stop reducing LSM possibilities : it cost a lot to develop things for a hook and then
redevelopping it for a classical syscall interposition.
