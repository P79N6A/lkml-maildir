Admittedly, the machine's load was not high when I took this sample. 
However, creating a great deal of load does not change these statistics 
at all.  Being that there are patches available for 2.4.x kernels to fix 
this, I don't think this at all by design, but what do I know? =)
2.6.0 running on a non-HT SMP machine I have (old Compaq proliant 
2xPentium2) does interrupt on all CPU's with "noirqbalance" bootparam.
Regarding the keyboard, I noticed something interesting
2.6.1-rc1 shows the i8042 in /proc/interrupts:
   1:       1871          0          0          0    IO-APIC-edge  i8042
(keyboard still does not work, though..)
2.6.1 final does not show this at all, and [kseriod] eats a constant 5% 
  CPU.  Something's awry =)
