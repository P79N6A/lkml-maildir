Well, you don't need to wait, I think.
All Jeremy and Becky need is adding highmem support to swiotlb. How we
support it doesn't matter. We can choose better one.
We all (including Jeremy) agreed that Becky's physical address scheme
is better (simpler) than Jeremy's struct page and offset
scheme. Surely, Becky's scheme works for Xen and him (Jeremy said that
he tested it lightly).
One remaining issue is how to support map_page/unmap_page. As we
discussed, we can add some workarounds for it but it's better to unify
dma_mapping_ops. I send patches to do it after testing them on an IA64
box tomorrow.
