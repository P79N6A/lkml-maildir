Hang on, it returned 32? It should not return more than 16, since that
is what we have room for and asked for. Using ->dead_key when ->key is
NULL is correct btw, since that is the correct location in the tree once
the process has exited. But that should not happen until AFTER the
func() call, so I still think the list patch is safer.

It boots here, so at least it passes normal sanity tests. It should
solve your problem as well, hopefully.
