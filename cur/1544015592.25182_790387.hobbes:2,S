So I took it for a test drive, using my currently-working .config, which has
CONFIG_TIGON3=y
CONFIG_FIRMWARE_IN_KERNEL=y
In the dmesg I see during early bootup:
[    0.694230] loop: module loaded

but once we get to userspace, 'ifconfig' or 'ip link show' have *zero*
about an eth0 device.
For comparison, the dmesg if I revert your patch:
[    0.696638] loop: module loaded

So it looks like the patch is failing to finish initialization of the card.
Damned if *I* can see what's breaking it, the conversion to use a helper
function tg3_request_firmware seems sane enough....
