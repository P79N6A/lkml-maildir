Ok - I see no problem that the simple handler doesn't mask the IRQ by
default like the level irq handler does.
However if I use disable_irq(irq) I would expect that the irq is somehow
disabled afterwards.
Our internal system IRQs doesn't need to be acked on the System
Interrupt Controller Level and we have simply just mask and unmask.
So I think I have two alternatives.
1) Bypass the delayed disable feature by implementing chip->disable and
chip->enable (simply map to mask and unmask)
2) Use level irq
