  PnP Card Serivice Revisions
  
  This set of changes addresses the following issues with the existing card 
  service implementation:
  
  1.) Only one driver can be bound to a card.
  2.) repetive code is required for pnp_request_card_device and other 
  functions
  
  This patch will make the card services usable by ALSA.
