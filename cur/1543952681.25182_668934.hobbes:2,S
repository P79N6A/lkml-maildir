found a build bug on 32-bit & PAE - pud_populate() assumed too much 
about types:
In file included from arch/x86/mm/pgtable.c:3:
include/asm/pgalloc.h: In function 'pud_populate':
include/asm/pgalloc.h:93: error: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type
i've uninlined it and has trickled that through your series.
