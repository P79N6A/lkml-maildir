What about creating symlinks with the old device names? That shouldn't give
rise to any collisions, as it only works in the /sys/class/firmware/ namespace
(correct me if I'm wrong, I haven't actually taken the time to investigate the
problem properly and have no experience with the firmware driver).
I've created the simple patch below. I have no idea if it actually works,
though, as I don't appear to have any hardware for which a linux driver
supports firmware loading. Please comment.
Oh, and I almost forgot to ask about __FUNCTION__, which is gcc-specific;
wouldn't it be a good idea to simply replace all occurrences in the kernel
source with __func__?
