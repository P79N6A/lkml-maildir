I've got kiobuf diffs which allow you to (a) map any kernel memory
(including vmalloced areas) into a kiobuf, and then (b) mmap any
kiobuf into user space using sane, faulting vmas (with the option of
prefaulting for performance if you want it).  Nobody is using it right
now so I wasn't planning on resending it to you until 2.5, but if you
want to give people a chance to start using it earlier I can send it
in.
