Thanks :-)
Kai and Roman have taken the big steps here!

The recursive Makefile invocations are still present. But just
working better than before.
I would like to write a small parser to generate one Makefile
for the kernel stuff but dunno when I will find time for it.
Main driver would be to increase speed when building a single
file. But it will also simplify building modules avoiding
the synchronization point we have before entering modpost stage.
