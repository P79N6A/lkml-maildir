I don't have any report like "no _STA on memory device" so far.
Current code assume each memory device has _STA.
I suppose each memory device should have _STA method. For example,
if a memory device is broken, its _STA should return disable status. 
So, basically checking _STA of only memory device should be ok now.
However I'm not sure that every vendor will do it in the future.
If there is no _STA on memory device, parents, grand-parents or
more ancestor might have _STA for it.
(See acpi_get_pxm() in driver/acpi/numa.c. It searches ancestor's _PXM.
 If insane vendor make like it, it will be good reference.)
Bye.
