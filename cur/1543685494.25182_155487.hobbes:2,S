Ingo's scheduler patch requires that the architecture provide a
sched_clock() function which returns nanoseconds.  We only have ia32, ia64,
ppc and ppc64 versions thus far.
A lame version is to just add
unsigned long long sched_clock(void)
{
	return (unsigned long long)jiffies * (1000000000 / HZ);
}
to arch/<foo>/kernel/timer.c
