sure, it's fine this way. Thanks!
We've already been discussing and playing with a cleaner alternative to
mremap that works too (mmap'ing a file on tmpfs, perhaps via
shm_open()). It's just that it's difficult to explain to users why DOSEMU
worked on 2.6.0 and suddenly stopped working with the same configuration
on 2.6.1.
-- the consensus amongst DOSEMU developers seems to be that you should
feel free to disallow this funny old_len==0 case in 2.7 if you like.
