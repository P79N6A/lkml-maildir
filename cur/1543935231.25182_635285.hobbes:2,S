That's odd.  afacit the only kmalloc in dmi_id_init() is
        dmi_dev = kzalloc(sizeof(*dmi_dev), GFP_KERNEL);
and even gcc-3.2.3 should be able to get that right.
Could you please a) verify that simply removing that line fixes the build
error and then b) try to find some way of fixing it?
Try replacing `sizeof(*dmi_dev)' with `sizeof(struct dmi_device_attribute)'
and any other tricks you can think of to try to make the compiler process
the code differently.
