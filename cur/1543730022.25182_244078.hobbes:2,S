Nvidia.  AFAIK all nvidia Linux drivers are either binary-only or
reverse-engineered.
To add insult to injury they have a stupid 20+page 'Nvidia Linux
Advantage' whitepaper on their site that conveniently fails to mention
the above.  They probably spent more money for some marketroid to put
that together than they ever spent on actually supporting Linux.
