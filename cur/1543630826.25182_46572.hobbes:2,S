I've got the same laptop with one battery, but I'm using ACPI. None of the
current user-space utilities parse this stuff particularly well (the
filenames in /proc/acpi have changed), but the data all look reasonable.
#cat /proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/*

present:                 yes

last full capacity:      57420 mWh
battery technology:      rechargeable
