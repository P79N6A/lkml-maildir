Hi.
I'm having some problems with getting my cd-writer working in the 2.2
kernels.
When I try to mount a cd in the kernel it says that it doesn't recognize
/dev/sr0 as being a block device. When I try to load the file atp870u.o
with insmod I get the following in /var/log/messages, and the load average
of the machine goes to 1. (The insmod process never stops)
---------Outout in /var/log/messages ---------------------------------->

I've tried with several different kernels (from the 2.2 series) including
2.2.5, 2.2.10, patch 2.2.10_ikd1, and Alan Coxes patches. Everything gives
the same result.
I'm using Redhat 6.0 with egcs version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux
(egcs-1.1.2 release)
I can inform that the device worked in kernel 2.0.35.
Can anyone help me, please?
Kind regards Jesper.
