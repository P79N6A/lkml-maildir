No. Check out irq.c, line 446. The interrupts are turned back on
only if the flag did not have SA_INTERRUPT set. Certainly most
requests for interrupt services within drivers have SA_INTERRUPT
set.
This is linux-2.4.18 or 2.4.19. If the current code, 2.5+ enables
by default, it's broken and should be fixed.
