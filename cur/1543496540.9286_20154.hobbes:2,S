Why should I think so ? ;)

Just a question, since I didn't even find the invisible ;-)  compiler
barrier and/or ordering rule that prooves this code will always behave 
as expected: 
	tsk->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE;
	run_task_queue(&tq_disk);
	if (buffer_locked(bh)) {
		schedule();
		goto repeat;
	}
run_task_queue() in inlined and calls macros and buffer_locked() is also a
macro. Nothing obvious in the code, even looking into run_task_queue() 
code seems to enforce the order we expect at compilation step for 
these 2 ones:
	tsk->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE;
	if (buffer_locked(bh)) {
Imagine it would be ever possible and correct for a clever compiler to
generate: 
	if (buffer_locked(bh)) {
		tsk->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE;
You may want to let me know if we may ever deserve ;-) this race on not ?
Regards,
   Gérard.
