It sounds like you added the EVMS common-files patch but not the actual EVMS 
code. This will cause the kernel config to break, since it can't find the 
file drivers/evms/Config.in.
If you want to build the latest EVMS kernel code from CVS, please see 
http://evms.sf.net/install.html
 (last section).

This doesn't make much sense. When I reproduce the above situation, all I get 
is an error from awk, and then make quits with an error. I can't imagine why 
it would cause your X server to blow up.
