I didn't try iostat, I did look at vmstat, and there the numbers look even 
worse, the bo column is ~500 for the resync by itself, but with the DD 
it's ~50,000. when I get access to the box again I'll try iostat to get 
more details

~30% of one cpu for the raid 6 thread, ~5% of one cpu for the resync 
thread
