Hmm, what has changed is that secondary CPUs haven't got
need_resched set in their idle routines. Whether or not it
is possible to a task on their runqueue at that stage, I
didn't bother looking - I assume you did.
However, Ingo - instead of calling schedule() at the end of
rest_init(), why not just set need_resched instead?
