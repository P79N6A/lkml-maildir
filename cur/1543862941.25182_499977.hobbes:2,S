Those interfaces could be supported on other platforms (iirc benh has 
been planning to add legacy_* support to ppc for awhile).  It would be 
great if they were supported everywhere to provide userspace with a 
fairly sane way to get at this stuff on all Linux systems...
Should be trivial on i386 I think.
