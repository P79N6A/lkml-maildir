Hi,
I have a problem with small program that connects a pty with a modem
accessed through TCP/IP.
The program dies with a SIGKILL in select() . An strace shows
select(16, [5 7], [], [], NULL)         = 1 (in [5])
read(5, "A^H ^H", 512)                  = 6
select(16, [7], [7], [], NULL)          = 1 (out [7])
write(7, "A^H ^H", 6)                   = 6
select(16, [5 7], [], [], NULL)         = ? ERESTARTNOHAND (To be
restarted)
+++ killed by SIGKILL +++
My kernel is 2.2.5
Can anyone give me a hint on what is going on here  ?
