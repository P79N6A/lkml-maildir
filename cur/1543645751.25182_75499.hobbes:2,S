I'm getting this while trying to access the alsa sound section in 2.5.40:
---------------------------------------------------------------
Menuconfig has encountered a possible error in one of the kernel's
configuration files and is unable to continue.  Here is the error
report:
 Q> ./scripts/Menuconfig: line 823: MCmenu74: command not found
Please report this to the maintainer <mec@shout.net>.  You may also
send a problem report to <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>.
Please indicate the kernel version you are trying to configure and
which menu you were trying to enter when this error occurred.
make: *** [menuconfig] Error 1
---------------------------------------------------------------
If I redirect stderr to a file I also see this in that file:
./scripts/Menuconfig: ./MCmenu74: line 56: syntax error near unexpected token `fi'
./scripts/Menuconfig: ./MCmenu74: line 56: `fi'
make: *** [menuconfig] Error 1
Thanks!
