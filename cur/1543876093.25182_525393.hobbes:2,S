turns out that NETIF_F_TSO6 is defined even if CONFIG_IPV6 is turned off, which 
is what broke e1000. That in itself might be a problem. Perhaps this should be 
fixed in netdevice.h (gratuitous bad inline patch below) but I'm not sure if 
people would appreciate this, as it's rather ugly, and it gets all horrible when 
people disable TCP protocol support...
In any case, I was not suspecting this at all. The patch to e1000 is fine with me.
