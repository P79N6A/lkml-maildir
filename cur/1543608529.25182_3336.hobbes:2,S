<Sigh> I don't read all of the LK list and the mail was not cc'd
to me, so I did not see this thread.

*Please stop editing things*.  I need the actual boot messages from
the detection of the aic7xxx card.  It would also be nice to see
the output of /proc/scsi/aic7xxx/<card #>

Dmesg please.

I'll run some tests tomorrow at work.  I'm sure the results will
be dependent on the cdrom in question but they may show something.

Isn't there a systat or vmstat equivalent under Linux that gives you
interrupt rates?  I'll poke around tomorrow when I'm in front of a Linux
box.

The driver may not be seeing the same things as SCSI-Select for some
strange reason.  Again, just email me a full dmesg after a successful
boot along with the /proc/scsi/aic7xxx/ output.

It really looks like a bug in the driver's round-robin code or perhaps
a difference in how many transactions we allow to be queued in the
untagged case.
Can you re-run your tests with the output directed to /dev/null for cdrom
reads and also perform some benchmarks against your disk?  The benchmarks
should operate on one device only at a time with as little I/O to any other
device during the test.
