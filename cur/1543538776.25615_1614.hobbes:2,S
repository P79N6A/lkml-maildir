See above.

Yup.  And one principle of Free software is "don't tell other people
what to do".
I'm sorry, Victor but this one gets under my skin.  If people want to
write kernel code in C++ well good for them.  All it requires of the
kernel developers is to take the darn C++ keywords out of the headers. 
About an hour's work for someone who has a license for /bin/vi.
This is an ideological language war masquerading as a technical and
supportability issue.
grrr...
