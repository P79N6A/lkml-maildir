 Well, the IDE hardware works, and conform to the ATA specs.
 Gujin is using those ATA command for quite a long time.
 I just have a problem with SATA chipset not being ATA1-7 compatible.

  The main problem for BIOS manufacturer is the keyboard mapping
 recognition to enter the password. And there is no real point
 in freezing the password system of a locked drive.
  Gujin try to solve most of those problems, but because it is
 located on the hard disk itself limit the choice - it would be
 so nice to have a big enough BIOS FLASH and put Gujin there.
 Second best choice is having two hard disks (compact flash as
 first HD with compact flash <-> IDE adapter).

  Well the ATA specs are quite old, Gujin still work with the BIOS hard disk
 so still act as a bootloader, but it can not protecting you against a
 1 milisecond attack setting password.
 By the way the SATA specs are not free.

  Oh yes, Gujin has some strange code to make things work at the end,
 look for ATAPI stuff - I can and do ignore the specs to make the software
 work on real hardware.
  Cheers,
  Etienne.
