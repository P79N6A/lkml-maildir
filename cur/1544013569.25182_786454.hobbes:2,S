Something to keep in mind is that the Posix standard does *NOT* say anything
about leap seconds - poke around in a 'struct tm' sometime.
That's why /usr/share/zoneinfo has separate 'posix' and 'right' subdirectories.
The fun starts when software using the 'right' rules tries to interact with
other software using the Posix rules (quite possibly running on a non-Unixy
system that doesn't even *use* zoneinfo).
Repeat after me: Not all the world is Linux.
