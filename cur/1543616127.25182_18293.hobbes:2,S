It is a convention used to reduce the risk of deadlock between the two
processes. If you are reading from a fd, you can't be writing to the
other (the pipe syscall returns two fds). If both processes attempt read
simultaneously, both sleep forever (unless using select/poll with a timeout).
Pipes were designed for creating one-way communication paths between processes.
It is better to use a domain socket which has better semantics for just
this occurance. Then you can use the accept/send/recv... network functions
which are much better at bi-directional communication.
