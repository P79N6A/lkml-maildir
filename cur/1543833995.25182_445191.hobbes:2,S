In fact, that's a very good reason why this shouldn't be in netfront.
Indeed, it shouldn't be in the guest at all.  The reason is that the
guest has no idea whether the physical carrier is present.
It's much better for the host to send the ARP packet on behalf of the
guest since the host knows the carrier status and the guest's MAC
address.
Cheers,
