I explained this one in the comment above the declaration of
struct pte_chain ;)
 * A singly linked list should be fine for most, if not all, workloads.
 * On fork-after-exec the mapping we'll be removing will still be near
 * the start of the list, on mixed application systems the short-lived
 * processes will have their mappings near the start of the list and
 * in systems with long-lived applications the relative overhead of
 * exit() will be lower since the applications are long-lived.
cheers,
Rik
