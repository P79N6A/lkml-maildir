Quick test, both problems seem fixed now with both patches applied, thanks
for fast response (something one does not get from commercial UNIX vendors).
Funny thing in this was that it totally smashed the Solaris in the other end

some networking buffers or something had eaten all memory (guessing from
seeing some error messages on console).
