But the implementation doesn't.
This is the same argument which we heard against a capability
bounding set, and I consider it thoroughly bogus in both cases.

I see no evidence of that.  The last patch I saw (admittedly,
I haven't been looking hard for one) was against 2.1.xx, and
used reserved space in the ext2 inode which has since been
used for other things.  Linux has available a pair of __u32s
in the on-disk inode which is not sufficient, I believe[0].
reiserfs has no inode space reserved for future expansion.
I am not saying that these are good things but merely that I
can't see filesystem-format inducing changes arriving in a
great hurry for so little direct gain.

Don't claim that this is complexity.  A(n untested) patch to
implement it is appended to this email.  It really is that
easy.

The all-powerful-root legacy is so great that the additional
hassle of rooting out problems caused by this change are far,
far outweighed by its usefulness, IMHO.
Matthew.
[0] My thinking is somewhat slow today, but as I recall the
    fs caps implementation wants to include all three sets,
    yes?
