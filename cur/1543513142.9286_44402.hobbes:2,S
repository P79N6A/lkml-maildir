Hi,
Please reply by eMail as this is not really for the list.
how far / efficient is the SMP support in Linux? I am planning to get a new
mainboard soon and wonder whether a dual Celeron board will be worth it.
	ABit BP6BX + 2x Celeron A 400 = about DM 600.-
	some other mainboard + Athlon 500 = about DM 600.-
I am using heavy multitasking so actually using the two CPUs won't be a
problem. (developing, graphics, database, rc5des :) I'm just unsure whether
2 Celerons will beat an Athlon.
