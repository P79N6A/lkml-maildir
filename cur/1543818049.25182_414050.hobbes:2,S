Hi,
I've just had a nasty oops on an amd64 server.  Sadly I wasn't able  
to capture the entire stack trace, but I did get :
   
http://elvis.nosignal.org/~andy/opteron_panic.jpg
Nothing was logged to syslog at the point of the panic, immediately  
before the server fell over there was this logged :
Apr  6 01:03:40 freezer kernel: dpti0: Trying to Abort cmd=61901448
Apr  6 01:03:51 freezer kernel: dpti0: Abort cmd not supported
Apr  6 01:03:51 freezer kernel: dpti0: Trying to reset device
Apr  6 01:03:51 freezer kernel: dpti0: Device reset not supported
Apr  6 01:03:51 freezer kernel: dpti0: Bus reset: SCSI Bus 0: tid: 9
Apr  6 01:03:51 freezer kernel: dpti0: Bus reset success.
I understand why a soft lockup might cause the kernel to oops.  What  
I don't understand is whether the above dpt flap could have caused  
the lockup ?  I've just upgraded to 2.6.16.1.
Anyone seen this before ?  Any more clues ?
cpu is dual AMD Opteron Processor 246.

Using dpt_i2o as had problems with machines of the same hardware  
build (Adaptec SR V) when trying i2o_block on opteron around six  
months ago.
