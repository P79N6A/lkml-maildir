	Oh yeah, forgot to mention -- the code snippet you mention is
executed during bootup by the kernel before the filesystems are even
mounted -- so the kernel flips into one of the protection modes before
anything else happens.
	As you mention, SGI has worked to open source even more of
their code -- in the above case, a "reference" implementation of a B1
system.  Our eventual hope is to have Linux security upgraded to meet
the needs of our C2 and B1 customers.  Currently, Irix is being 
officially evaluated for B1 compliance.  Our Open Source System (oss)
contains about everything we could release that wasn't encumbered by
license or copyright restrictions that we couldn't waive.
