hmm.. Main reason why Andrew posted this for stable series is because of
the memory leak issue mentioned in the patch changeset comments...
We have not seen any stability issues because of this patch so far(its been
there for more than a month in -mm series). Lack of this patch is actually 
causing us more troubles (DOS/app failures/..).
