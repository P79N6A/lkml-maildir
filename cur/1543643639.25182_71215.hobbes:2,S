Easy fix. Will do. The original version you had to tell it which kernel you were
running so I can add that as optional.

Perfectly reasonable. Be aware though that reducing mem will also change the
write size of io loads in contest. Although this will test the VM's response to
half and full size writes it will also decrease the size of IO load.
