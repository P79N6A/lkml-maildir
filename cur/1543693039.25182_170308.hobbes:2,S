I don't quite see how they belong in the kernel source tree,
although I don't mind...  That's not where I would expect to find
the list, though.  I would expect it more on kernel.org e.g.

One editor if it's in a "file" vs. being in a wiki.

| If it ends up going into a source tree, I can be the editor / maintainer.
of only must-fix and not should-fix??
I wouldn't want to see should-fix abandoned.
