In my not so humble opinion, throwing OSS away will be a big mistake,
as long as there are people willing to maintain it. Keep it there and
let the users (or distributions) choose what to use. I've seen
multiple bug reports of cards that work with OSS and don't work with
ALSA (and vice versa), so keeping both seems the proper thing to
do. Personally, I maintain one OSS driver, and fix bugs in others
occasionally.
