Hi Greg,
68328serial is the last driver to call pm_register and thus using and
keeping alive the really old PM scheme.  Any chance to convert it over
to platform devices (which would also clean up a lot of the ifdef
mess in the driver), or simply rip out that rudimentary PM support?
On a less urgent basis, is there any chance to convert the driver
to use serial_core, which it doesn't despite living in drivers/serial?
