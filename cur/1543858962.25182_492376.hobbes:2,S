How about '# CONFIG_IEEE1394_DV1394 is not set'?
Hand edited the .config and fired off my makeit script, which does it all 
& rebooted.
[root@coyote ~]# lsmod|grep 1394
raw1394                32264  0
ohci1394               39088  0
ieee1394              305624  2 raw1394,ohci1394
The camera has been turned back off, but yes, it works absolutely normally 
now.  With no dv1394 in memory!
Then with the camera on and kino controlling it:
[root@coyote ~]# lsmod|grep 1394
raw1394                32264  4
ohci1394               39088  0
ieee1394              305624  2 raw1394,ohci1394
So we still don't appear to have any use of/for ohci1394.  What the heck 
is it supposed to be doing?
Now, do I need dv1394 to do the export if I were to want to re-write the 
edited video back to the tape in the camera?  This is something I believe 
I'm supposed to be able to do, but never have yet as I consider the tape 
a capture only medium due to incompatibilities with the vcr Joe Sixpack 
has.  Just about everyone has a dvd player these days, so that is what I 
export to.
