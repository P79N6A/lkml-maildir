Checked your patch, but there are several problems with it.
For one, it only takes into account one OHCI1394 card being installed.
You'd be better of iterating over a list of all cards rather than
hardcoding one card, but that's moot given point 2.
Secondly, it seems that the problem doesn't really lie in ohci1394, but
that it actually has to do with the disk layer. From other usages of the
pmu interface, it seems that your best example is in drivers/scsi/mesh.c
and the change should be applied to sbp2.c.
If you need further help, you may want to talk to BenH (ppc maintainer).
