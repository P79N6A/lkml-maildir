	Looking at sys_remap_file_pages() it appears that the shared flag must
be set in order to remap. Executable mappings are always MAP_PRIVATE and
hence lack the shared flag so that any modifications to those areas
don't get written back to the executable. I don't think userspace can
change this flag -- even using plain mremap. So, unless there's a way to
change that flag, I don't think there's anything related to
VM_EXECUTABLE vmas that needs to be done here.
Cc'ing linux-mm.
