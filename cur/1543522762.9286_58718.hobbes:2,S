Jes, I've discussed this topic with Andreas Schwab and he told me that
my patch is ok for m68k.
Please reread the discussion: struct siginfo (and not signal handling
in general!) is completly broken with glibc 2.x on m68k - on every
kernel.  With my patch to the kernel I bring glibc and kernel in synch
- and remove a lot of uneccessary stuff.
Andreas
