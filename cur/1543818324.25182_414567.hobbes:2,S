Actually, it ate more than 1.6G -- that was just the resident size, and
it likes to allocate more memory in between you closing the window and
it finally exiting (or, you killing it before it OOMs the box, whichever
comes first).
qgit has absolutely no problem with the grafted full history, though,
and those previously mentioned rev-list changes by Linus should fix
git-whatchanged.
Unfortunately, this does nothing to fix the disturbing lack of useless
Simpsons trivia knowledge in the git community. Keith Packard made the
same mistake last week.
