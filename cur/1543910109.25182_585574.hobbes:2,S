I agree that (1) one risks overdoing comments and (2) one should minimize
comments inside a function body.
But I read your earlier statement:
  Please do not add comments inside functions.
as simply requesting no comments inside function bodies, without
exception.  That seems to me to be too strong a statement.
The "try to avoid" in the CodingStyle I read as meaning roughly
"minimize" which is consistent with what it further states, allowing
for "small comments" in certain cases.
Admittedly, I probably agree with you that the command that Anand
added in his patch was one of those comments that didn't add enough
value to be justified.
I was just quibbling over the wording of your objections to it.
 ... I'll shut up now.
