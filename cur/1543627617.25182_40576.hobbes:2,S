I noticed a dbench regression in 2.5.8 too.  The light at 
the end of the tunnel looks bright and close though. :)
(reference to near-death experience - not a train. :)
Running dbench 128 on ext2 mounted with delalloc and Andrew's
patches from 
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/2.5/2.5.8/
was 7.5x faster than 2.5.8 vanilla and 1.5x faster than 
2.4.19pre6aa1.
It will be fun to see what the other i/o benchmarks
and OSDB do with Andrew's delalloc patches.
