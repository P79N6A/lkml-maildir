You're right.  It'll have to be conditional: if output chain,
don't print mac address.
Jens, this means passing the chain arg through ip_fw_domatch to
dump_packet, and having it dump source mac address iff chain !=
IP_FW_OUTPUT_CHAIN (if !testing, chain must be a built-in, and
dump_packet only gets called if !testing, so must be INPUT or
FORWARD).
Rusty.
