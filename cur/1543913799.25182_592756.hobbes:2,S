Hi,
Please use kernel-doc notation here:
(see Documentation/kernel-doc-nano-HOWTO.txt or source file examples
or ask)
easy fix:
 /*
+ * Account guest cpu time to a process.
/**
 * account_guest_time - Account guest cpu time to a process.
+ * @p: the process that the cpu time gets accounted to
+ * @cputime: the cpu time spent in virtual machine since the last update
+ */
+void account_guest_time(struct task_struct *p, cputime_t cputime)
+{
Thanks.
