The former, I think. I turned on "3rd level pagetables in high memory". Presumably that's still just highpte.
larry:~/linux/2.5.73-mm3# grep HIGH .config
# CONFIG_NOHIGHMEM is not set
# CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G is not set
CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G=y
CONFIG_HIGHMEM=y
CONFIG_HIGHPTE=y
# CONFIG_DEBUG_HIGHMEM is not set
But yes, it's probably coincidence.
