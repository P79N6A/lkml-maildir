There shouldn't, if things were perfect.

-O3 at least.

Not really.
But -O3 creates faster code w/ some strange flaws like failing nfs-boot.
Maybe that's fixed in the latest gcc, but gcc-3.2.2 was exhibiting this bug.
So this doesn't really help a developer to be confident about compiler 
optimization, thus taking the safe route for performance sensitive 
code-paths.
Thanks!
