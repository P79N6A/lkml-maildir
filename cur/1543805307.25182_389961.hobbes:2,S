Well, cdrecord relies on libscg, so in effect most of the portability code
that is affected is in libscg; some of the real-time code however is
specific to cdrecord.

/dev/sd* for CD writing? I think you're off track here. AFAICS cdrecord uses
/dev/sg* to access the writer.

This, and if the code can then be used on other platforms, then there is
little point in calling the Linux /dev/hd* device "badly designed", unless
there were problems with it that prevented cdrecord (or libscg, for pxupdate
or something like that) from working properly.
So I'll repeat my question: is there anything that SG_IO to /dev/hd* (via
ide-cd) cannot do that it can do via /dev/sg*? Device enumeration doesn't count.
The numbers we get from ide-scsi for ATAPI writers are skewed anyhow, I'm
getting 1,0,0 for a SATA hard disk, 2,0,0 for secondary master
DVD-RAM/±R[W], 3,0,0 for secondary slave CD-RW... I wonder why these could
be desirable, and if they are really as static as they pretend to be. I
doubt that, their numbers depend on the order of driver loading.
