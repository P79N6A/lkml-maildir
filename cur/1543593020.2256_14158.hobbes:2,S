Andre,
Attached is a patch for hpt366.c for the following:
	better support for multiple controllers
	better /proc output
	66 MHz PCI timings
	implement the HDIO_GET/SET_BUSSTATE ioctls (see previous patch)
This patch does rely on the PCI busspeed patch (sent to lkml earlier).
Please let me know if you have any problems with this for general
inclusion.
Tim
