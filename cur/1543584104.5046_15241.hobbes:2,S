Yes. On a uniprocessor system, a simple fallback is to just use a semaphore
instead of a spinlock, since you can guarantee that there's no point in
scheduling the current task until the holder of the "lock" releases it.
Otherwise, the spin calling sched_yield() each iteration isn't too horrible.

It would be if it were generally available. The implementation on DYNIX/ptx
requires a privilege (PRIV_SCHED IIRC), to be able to use it. It was added
for a database to prevent preemption during critical sections.

Hmmm.. depends what you mean by sleep i.e sleep(3) vs. making a system call
that sleeps. I would have thought the latter, and use semaphores again.

That's basically a weaker version of the no-preempt. Not a bad idea, but
less than optimal :-)
