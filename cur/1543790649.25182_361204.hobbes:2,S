I tend to agree with that, in theory.
But the cpu_online_map reference had broken some (driver, module, ...?)
that had wasted a bit of Andrew's time, which was worth something to me
as well.  I was more than happy to make a one-line change if it removed
a small pothole on Andrew's road.
We've got a couple of schools of thought here ... at least.
I tend to prefer having the source code express the general case, and
then using header file magic to optimize the generated code for the uni-
processor systems.  I guess this would be Rusty-style source code,
Andrew-style machine code, and esoteric style headers.

Yeah.  Not worth messing with, in my book.
