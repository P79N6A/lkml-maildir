It seems to work with AT91SAM9260, but unfortunately not without
problems. I occasionally get TX underrun errors, mostly while
transferring some large files. The same thing happens with driver
provided by TimeSys in their AT91SAM9260-enabled Linux distribution
recommended by Atmel (both drivers share the codebase). Is there
anything I can check by myself (without an ICE) to see what's wrong?
Some printk() in macb_tx() maybe?
