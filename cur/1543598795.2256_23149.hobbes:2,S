Reading the PVR is probably faster in this case, since you avoid a
potential cache miss. As I said in an earlier message the __USE_RTC macro
should be made dependent on whether the kernel supports 601 or not.

No, this is not what they are trying to capture. Furthermore the 7 LSB of
the decrementer on a 601 are not random (but they don't seem to be 0
always despite the documentation) so you would have to shift the result
right by 7. Because you need this test, it's better taking the time base
or RTC and adding some salt from the upper half while we are at it.
