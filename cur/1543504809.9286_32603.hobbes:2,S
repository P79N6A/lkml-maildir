2.2.10 has known fs-corrupting bugs.  You can try 2.2.11pre4 which has at
least most of the bugs fixed (I believe there are a couple of networking
bugs left which Alan & davem need to merge).  2.2.11pre4 can be found at
ftp://ftp.XX.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/alan/;
 you will need to apply
pre2 to clean 2.2.10 then apply pre3 and pre4 on top of that.
