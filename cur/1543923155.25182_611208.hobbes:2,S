You should try and get some output from dmesg and not from the messages 
log, as the log daemon seems to have a nasty habit of discarding 
critical output from these errors. In this case the failing command is 
missing and the message ordering even seems off.

There should be more than this at the very least.. As above, please try 
to get output from dmesg itself.

I don't think that is the case, more like the drives have not been 
detected at all. If this happens after a reboot when they were working 
before, that sounds like some kind of a hardware issue most likely..
