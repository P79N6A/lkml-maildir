You're thinking of after the VFs are created the VF drivers (which may or may 
not be part of the PF driver) may not be able to communicate back to the PF 
driver that something else needs to be done (I remember seeing this in the 
earlier thread, should have included it in my post, sorry)?  I'm not sure if 
it makes sense to add an interface like that to the core until we have feel 
for what the PF/VF drivers are going to want... Or do you have something 
specific in mind right now?  If/until we have something in the core, it seems 
like this could be done on a per PF/VF driver basis for now.

That's a good point, Yu?
