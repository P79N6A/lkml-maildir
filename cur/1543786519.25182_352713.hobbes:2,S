Sam,
I was wondering if anyone else is seeing the following error/warning  
when building a recent kernel.  This error seems to have been  
introduced between 2.6.13 and 2.6.14-rc1:
   CHK     include/linux/version.h
   CHK     include/linux/compile.h
   CHK     usr/initramfs_list
/bin/sh: line 1: +@: command not found
   CHK     include/linux/compile.h
   UPD     include/linux/compile.h
   CC      init/version.o
   LD      init/built-in.o
   LD      vmlinux
   SYSMAP  System.map
I'm building a cross compiled ARCH ppc kernel on an x86 host.  I  
tried using git bisect to track down the error but for some reason it  
ended up referencing a change before 2.6.13 which I really dont  
understand.
Anyways, let me know if you need more info on this.
thanks
