Something I just noticed, which I missed during the initial devres review...
The vast majority of my ATA drivers originally called 
pci_request_regions(), to reserve all regions attached to a device.
In converting to pcim_iomap_regions(), we no longer reserve /all/ 
regions, only the ones requested.
This is actually a bug:  it was intentional to call 
pci_request_regions(), because that ensures that no other software will 
use our resources -- even if we are not actively using the resource in 
question.
Or IOW, I wanted to ensure that there would be no device sharing... 
which this devres conversion accidentally enabled.
The simple fix is obviously to replace pci_request_region() call with 
pci_request_regions() in lib/devres.c, but I wonder if that will break 
any existing driver?
