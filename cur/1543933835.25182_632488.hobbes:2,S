I'm dropping out from this one.
I worked for a good while, and I really see no way of improving what
the usage information (slabinfo -h) already provides. It's a good
description, and I'm starting to think that adding a man page is
overkill. If I am misunderstanding something and what is desired is in
fact usage information in the man page format, I can provide such a
page, no problem.
At least now I know how to write man pages.
