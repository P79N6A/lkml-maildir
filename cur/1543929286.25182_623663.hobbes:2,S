maybe: if the user does a Ctrl-C (or a kill -9), the kernel should try 
to honor it, instead of staying there stuck for a very long time 
(possibly forever)?
I think you are somehow confusing two issues: this patch in no way 
declares that "long waits are bad" - if the user _choses_ to wait for 
the NFS server (after phoning IT quickly or whatever), he can wait an 
hour. This patch only declares that "long waits _that the user has no 
way to stop_ are quite likely bad".
Do you see the important distinction between the two cases? Please 
reconsider your position (or re-state it differently), it just makes no 
rational sense to me so far.
