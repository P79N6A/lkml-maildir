Not sure what ate my original reply, so here I go again.
Yes, it will be visible in free(1) and dmesg. The amount of available
physical memory will be increased. For the most part because of the
ability of the stock bootmem to merge sub-page allocations while
otherwise tracking things at page granularity (using bdata->last_offset)
is limited. On the other hand, I track things at address granularity and
so achieve a "tightest packing" regardless of the order in which
allocations are done.
Cheers,
Bill
