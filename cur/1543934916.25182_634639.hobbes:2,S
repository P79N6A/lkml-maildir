FWIW, people moaning about the lack of entry-level kernel work would
do well by decoding those to the level of "this place in this function,
called from <here>, with so-and-so variable being <this>" and posting
the results.  As skills go, it's far more useful than "how to trim
the trailing whitespace" and the rest of checkpatch.pl-inspired crap
that got so popular lately...
