The scsi error handler is also used to retrieve sense data for
adapters/drivers that do not auto retrieve it. In such cases, it should
not issue any aborts, resets etc.
Your change effectively disables that support - we never hit the code in
scsi_eh_get_sense() to request sense. It would be very nice if we could
fix (or audit) all the scsi drivers, apply your change and remove
scsi_eh_get_sense, but AFAIK that has not and is not happening.
I don't know if your adapter/driver has auto sense retrieval (imm.c?).
I would guess a change in scsi_error.c related to sense (scsi_eh_get_sense)
handling is causing problems, and if your driver has auto sense then
something is wrong with the scmd->sense_buffer.
It would still be useful to see the console log output with scsi_logging=1
for your failure case.
