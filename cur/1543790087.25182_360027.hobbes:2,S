Hi Mark,
Yeah, I saw this too, and it went through to Thomas Gleixner and then to
John Stultz, where he said that he may have fixed this in his latest
version.  So we are now waiting on Thomas to pull John's work into the
ktimers code, and then onto Ingo's RT base.
So, until then, you may just ignore the messages.  It should only happen
when the tsc clocksource changes.
Unless, of course -rt5 already has this (I just got back from Germany,
so I've been out of the loop).
Thomas, this hasn't been done yet, has it?
