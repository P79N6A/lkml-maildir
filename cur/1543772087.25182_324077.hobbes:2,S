Thanks, however, without CONFIG_CHELSIO_T1_OFFLOAD card is not detected (no
wonder, driver enables T110 card only if offload is used). I do not need TCP
offload engine. With T1 Offload it cannot be compiled - it reject
cxgbtoe-2.1.1-linux-2.6.6-toe_api.patch
So, do I really need Offloading in kernel or should it work with just enableing
card in sources even without Offloading?
