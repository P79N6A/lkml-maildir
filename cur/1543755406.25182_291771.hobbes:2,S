I was following Rusty Russell's approach. Also, I believe this is more 
intuitive because the standard libc strdup function is declared in string.h.
However, I really don't have strong feelings either way, so if the 
majority agrees that this should be in mm/slab, its fine by me.

Unfortunately my email client messes up inline patches and wordwraps / 
mangles white space, so I resort to attaching them until I have time to 
look into fixing that :(
