That's a good question.  The answer is that we don't have enough EROS
applications to know for sure, but that the extent-based allocation strategy for
space appears to get you all of the locality you need for file systems.  For
applications that really care, there are mechanisms architected (but not yet
implemented) to guarantee contiguous allocation.  The disk arm behavior of EROS
differs significantly from that of Linux, so it's not clear that the locality
issues play out in exactly the same way.

This is a good idea, but you don't want to do it while your customers are on
hold waiting for the computer to reboot.
