This is possible with WCCPv2 using direct routing avoiding the need of
GRE/WCCP tunneling. WCCPv2 patches do exists for Squid-2.5, but may be a
little hard to find.. (no official maintainer of the WCCPv2 support for
Squid at the moment)

Please note that this module is by no means clean, and lacks a lot in 
security.
There is also a WCCP patch available to the GRE driver. This approach 
provides a little more security but is also more complex to set up for the 
same reasons and is not used very much..

The GRE patch is very simplistic and would do good of being properly 
implemented and integrated with the "ip tunnel" command for 
configuration of the GRE protocol (normal GRE / WCCPv1 / WCCPv2 / 
whatever...).

I think approach 1 (decapsulation within GRE) is most suitable. It also 
provides an adequate level of control on security and permissions which 
may be hard to accomplish if separating the two.
