It seems that a process blocked in a write to an xfs filesystem due to
xfs_freeze cannot be frozen by the freezer.
I see this if I suspend my laptop while doing something xfs-filesystem
intensive, like a kernel build.  My suspend scripts freeze the XFS
filesystem (as Dave said I should), which presumably blocks some writer,
and then the freezer times out and fails to complete.
Here's part of the process dump the freezer does when it times out:

 =======================
I haven't looked at how to fix this yet.  I only just worked out why I
was getting suspend failures.
