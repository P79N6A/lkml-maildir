No need to renumber.  You remove TIF_SYSCALL_EMU which is six,
so the newly added TIF_FORCED_TF could reuse that bit.

Not really that much.  Prefered would be just a normal comment which

Thanks.  If you need some help ping me or Randy.

That's the normal approach.  If it's big enough it might even make
sense to give it a file of it's own to have the compat code totally
separate.  But IIRC there wasn't a whole lot of compat code in utrace.

Current gcc (since 3.<something>) can optimize away code under if-branches
that are determinable at compile time, so having each architecture
define a (possible trivial) arch_has_single_step() should be fine.
Btw, is there a fundamental reason why an architecture would not support
single-stepping except for a transition period of porting, i.e. are there
real hardware limitation in any of our ports?

It's used pretty consistant in core code not written by you, which
looks similarly horrible.  Please try to fit a consistant style.

Needs comments in the code explaining it.

It's just a few uses and expands to two lines of code, so avoiding
the macro probably is a good idea.

Yeah, the latter probably makes sense.
