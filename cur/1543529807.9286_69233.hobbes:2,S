I'm sorry, but that is exactly what I was trying to do.  Show that I
can become any user other than root.  Here is the same command
working on a system without these problems:
gerf,  3:02PM Mon 13> sudo -u man bash
Password:
bash-2.03$ id
uid=6(man) gid=100(users) groups=100(users)
But thanks for trying to help.
Ciao!
