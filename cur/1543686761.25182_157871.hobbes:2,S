No, and I doubt there will be in a big hurry, unless I come up with an
easy way to make lvm-over-raid0 break instantly instead of eventually.
I think that for now you should assume tat lvm over raid0 (or raid0
over lvm) simply isn't supported.  As lvm (aka dm) supports striping,
it shouldn't be needed.
