My understanding is that it's a mask, which just happens to be treated
as an upper address limit on sane platforms.
However, we have a case where it's a real mask (no surprises there!)
Intel decided not to fix a bug in a chip which means that an address
line (normally A20) must never be asserted during DMA cycles, although
it can address more than 1MB of memory.  The effect of this is that
even MB are dma-able and odd MB aren't.  Not nice.
