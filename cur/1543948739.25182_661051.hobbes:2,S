I forgot to CC Matt on the posting of the patch set (I figured he was on
fsdevel or lkml) so I asked him about this and here is the response.
"The allocation flag used depends on where the call is made.
In some cases allocation is not permitted to wait, etc."
I'm assuming he felt that the sections marked NOWAIT could not wait for
memory allocation. If people want to review them, and find to the
contrary we can figure out what the correct ones are.
