Yes. You are right. I actually mentioned this on a different thread: I 
eventually found out that the kernel was compiled with -mregparam=3, and 
the module was not. This option seems to have been added to the default 
config and/or Red Hat's build setup sometime before the current kernel 
release, but after the start of the 2.6 series...
