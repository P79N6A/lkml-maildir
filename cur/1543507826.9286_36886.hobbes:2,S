Hello all,
There are several jobs at the Lab that Linux people might be interested in, 
but at least one is more for the low-level kernel developers.  For more info 
see job number 990119 at the "Employment at Fermilab" page:
http://fnalpubs.fnal.gov/employ/jobs.html
From what I gather from Don Holmgren, they're working on porting Linux to VME 
PowerPC based boards and extending it's real-time capabilities so we can get 
away from VxWorks, but don't quote me on that.
Cheers,
Dan
