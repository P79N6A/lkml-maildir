ftape fails on SMP due to sti/save_flags/restore_flags removal.
My .config:
CONFIG_SMP=y
...
CONFIG_FTAPE=m
CONFIG_ZFTAPE=m
...
# CONFIG_FT_STD_FDC is not set
# CONFIG_FT_MACH2 is not set
# CONFIG_FT_PROBE_FC10 is not set
CONFIG_FT_ALT_FDC=y
#
# Consult the manuals of your tape drive for the correct settings!
#
CONFIG_FT_FDC_BASE=0x360
CONFIG_FT_FDC_IRQ=6
CONFIG_FT_FDC_DMA=2
CONFIG_FT_ALPHA_CLOCK=0
And the warnings:

I have the HW so I can test patches if someone feels like fixing this.
