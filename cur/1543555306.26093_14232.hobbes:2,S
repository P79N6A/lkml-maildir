that is obtainable by fingering @finger.kernel.org (I only ever use/report
bugs on the latest kernel).

that is the tricky question -- i.e. the bugs do not point to those modules
but I need them to produce enough stress on the MM and io subsystem to
trigger the bugs (but then again, I may be wrong and the bugs _do_ point
to those). But yes, I understand this concern and try to reproduce it on
as clean/plain kernel as possible.
