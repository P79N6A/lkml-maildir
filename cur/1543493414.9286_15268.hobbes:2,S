Don't know but you could try changing MAX_HWIFS in include/asm/ide.h to a
bigger value from 6 to 8. then in driver/block/ide.c make some changes
like to ide_hwif_to_major and copy more entries for stuff like
do_ide[0-7]_request etc. I'd think that it should work.

I don't have the cards so I can't test that out.

MAX_HWIFS for starters, maybe there are other limitations that I don't
know about. But yes you have to assign new major numbers to those new
devices and then run mknod as needed to create the entries in your /dev .
Good Luck.
