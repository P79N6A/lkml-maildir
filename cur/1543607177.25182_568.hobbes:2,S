Sounds like Linux is slowly crawling towards the WHQL perspective on
drivers from Microsoft.  If they aren't qualified:
	Microsoft == WHQL
	Linux == ((!tainted) + EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() + ...)
... then they aren't supportable or acceptable for distribution by
anyone other than the creators.
I wouldn't be surprised if someone creates a LHQL process or
business to qualify binary drivers on supportable kernels from
distributions.  I'd give it about a year.
