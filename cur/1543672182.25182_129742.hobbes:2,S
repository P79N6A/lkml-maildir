Hello list,
Today I've tried to get my infrared synchronisation to my palm pilot working. 
Unfortunately, it doesn't work - I get nothing at all. It worked fine under 
2.4.20.
The modules in question are irda, ircomm and ircomm_tty.
Upon load of the modules, this is shown in the logs:
IrCOMM protocol (Dag Brattli)
Module ircomm_tty cannot be unloaded due to unsafe usage in 
include/linux/module.h:457
ircomm_tty_attach_cable()
ircomm_tty_ias_register()
ircomm_tty_close()
ircomm_tty_shutdown()
ircomm_tty_detach_cable()
ircomm_close()
And that's all. I cannot open /dev/ircomm0 or ircomm1, which are:
laptop:/usr/src/linux/net/irda/ircomm# ls -l /dev/ircomm*
crw-rw----    1 root     dialout  161,   0 Dec 16 14:34 /dev/ircomm0
crw-rw----    1 root     dialout  161,   1 Dec 16 14:34 /dev/ircomm1
Any ideas what i can try?
Thanks!
Jan
