This is bad -- 'c' requests an address constant (CONSTANT_ADDRESS_P
if you're playing from home), and as defined this constant must be
valid in an instruction.
Such things are by nature target specific.  On ia64, for instance,
there are *no* valid address constants, since all valid memory
addresses are simple registers.
You can do what you want here with just "%0".
