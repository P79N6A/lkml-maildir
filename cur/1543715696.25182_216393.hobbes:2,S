Thanks for explaining.
I remember separately I saw the famous Ben F guess that the unamerican
chars were at issue: maybe the truthful or slanderous rumours of UDF in
2004 tripping over unamerican chars as often as other software does have
substance.
I imagine to experiment we may need to bring both Windows and Linux
together: either alone might convert between bytes and chars in a
lossless consistent way that only happened not to be standard.

Lost me, help?
"No problem at all"?!?
We're discussing NON COMPLIANCE ... are we not?
That is, we're discussing a plain failure to meet the requirement,
tolerated because, by design, less than all actual UDF implementations
actually require all the published requirements.
Indeed, we know some programmers prefer to write code to comply only
with the de jure theory of the merely public specifications ... rather
than writing code that consciously quietly tolerates and thereby
encourages continuing violations of those specifications.
How then can we flatly say no UDF implementation should refuse to mount
because of a missing redundant AVDP?
Why can't someone reasonably choose to make their UDF more trustworthy
and simultaneously less friendly by requiring the redundant AVDP to be
present and in agreement?
Why must everyone trust the failure model that says the missing AVDP
doesn't matter?
Indeed, someone could reasonably require the Philips UDF Verifier to
bless a disc before automounting that disc.  No?

All that said, then yes for this specific case of Linux UDF, I agree
with you, Linux by design interoperates well with Windows, both as
delivered from Microsoft and as commonly patched, so here the de facto
standard of:
UDF IUVD LVInfo1: "!roxioUDF!n>2173136!s>0!d>286!"
wins over the de jure theory of a requirement for two redundant AVDP.

Again the de jure theory of conformant VSID loses to the de facto
interoperability of tolerating such abuse?

I hope I did right by deleting the linux_udf-owner from the cc.
