The buttons sort of work. The video however, does not turn on with X loaded
or without. I get a blank screen. You can tell the machine is powered back
on because you can log into it still (and run find command to see hard disk
activity).
Something else I noticed, when ACPI fails to shut the machine down fully,
and I hold the power button to shut it off completely, I hear a buzzing
sound from the back, if I remove the battery and plug it back in the laptop
becomes completely silent. I'm not sure what this is though (?).
That issue I don't think is connected to ACPI.
