No, I saw that epoll_data_t was a union (although, it kind of makes the 
ptr useless as a user data pointer.. but I'm not using it for that)
When I mean that pointers are getting corrupted, I just mean in other 
parts of the code (actually it's some C++ STL container's data and is 
completely unrelated to the epoll specific code)  Something, somewhere 
seems to be writing to memory that it's not supposed to be writing to.  
And as far as I can tell, it happens when I use epoll and doesn't when I 
use select  :-/
