I'd do this, unless you have dozens of them.
E.g. drivers/net/sunhme.c.

That's nonsense, IMHO.

I think this is only done if API is different. Often these
directories cannot be processed by a build process on other
architectures, so they are kept outside to have Makefiles smaller.
See also drivers/sbus, which could be called "drivers/sun" just
as well. But really, it's separate because of sparc_alloc_io().
I appreciate a lot that drivers/acpi is so easy to exclude
from builds - it breaks on anything but Intel stuff.

See #3. The ia64 uses standard APIs.

Yeah, lessee what penguins say, and also I think DaveM may
lend some good expirience here.
