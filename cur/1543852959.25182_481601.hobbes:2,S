Hi,
I think  the program which is called by
call_usermodehelper() will not  be executed at
privilege level zero on IA-32 machines. 
Am I right?
How to run a program which has been compiled by a
compiler(say gcc) at privilege level zero?
Indeed I  want to compare time taken in executing two
programs. If we run them at privilege level zero by
calling them in a kernel module, processor will not
switch to other processors. So that we can find out
time taken to execute a program more accurately.
What you say??
Thanks in advance.
