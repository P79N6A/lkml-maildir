You are confusing two entirely different things.
First of all, there is the problem of making sure that data is on the
floppy as soon as possible so that it is safe to remove the disk.
Secondly, there is the problem about what to do if the user removes
the disk in the middle of IO.
Even when we are flushing everything to disk immediately, it is still
possible for the user to remove the disk, and it is what happens here
that I was talking about.  You were suggesting that we need a daemon
to pop up and tell the user to reinsert the disk.  That's far more
complexity than we need.

Supermount already does this, so your entire argument is void.  If you
are running supermount, it makes an absolute guarantee that a close()
of the last file open for write on the filesystem will cause all dirty
buffers to be flushed immediately _before_ the close() is allowed to
complete, and therefore before the user is told that the save
operation has finished.  With supermount, if you write a new file to
the floppy the disk light goes on immediately while the full contents
are saved, and the disk is safe to eject as soon as the disk light
goes off.

Sorry, you are simply wrong here.  Supermount was initially written
for use in a cybercafe where random users off the street would come
in, save stuff and expect to be able to remove the disk immediately.
It worked.
