The kind of thing Linus was talking about would limit you (as swsusp and 
uswsusp do now) to only half the amount of memory. I suppose you could lzf 
compress as you did the snapshot. That would generally get you up to 2/3rds, 
but then again you can't know what compression ratio you'll get until you 
try, so reliability would suffer or it would take longer because of retrying.
I/O from swsusp and suspend2 use bios directly, so the page cache isn't an 
issue for them (apart from the fact that Suspend2 saves the page cache 
separately so it can get a full image). Not sure about uswsusp.
Only having half the amount of memory doesn't sound like a big limitation for 
modern desktops & laptops, but don't forget that there are embedded guys 
wanting to hbernate too :)
Regards,
Nigel
