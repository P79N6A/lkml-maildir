Hi,
as far as I understand nothing prevents a scheduled tasklet to have
Linux jump to its routine, when the routine is in a module being
rmmod'd. How should I take care of this?
Are timers safe regarding this (I mean, we can consider the timer
function won't be called as soon as del_timer() has returned)?
Sincerely yours,
