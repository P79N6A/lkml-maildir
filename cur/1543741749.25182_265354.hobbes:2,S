Yes, we tried those, but floating point calculations completely kill the 
performance on those boards.
Even at 25% speed a P4 2.8GHz gives a 700MHz clock which completely 
toasts a 600MHz (or even a 1GHz) C3 in floating point calculations... :(
Even more, I can get a Asus mainboard with integrated VGA, LAN, USB, 
Audio, for half the price of a VIA EPIA mini-ITX with comparable integer 
performance. As we always have to buy these things in quantities of 5, 
this can make some difference.
