Subject: [BK PATCH] PCI update for 2.6.3-rc1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Here are some PCI and PCI hotplug patches for 2.6.3-rc1.
The majority of this is the dmapool code that has been moved from the
pci core to the driver core to enable platforms that do not have pci
support to still use dma pools.  There are a number of other minor PCI
hotplug fixups, and I cleaned up the PCI MSI code a bit.
All of these changes have been in the last few -mm trees with no
problems (not including the UML build, which the UML people need to fix
in their own...)
Please pull from:
	bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/pci-2.6
thanks,
greg k-h
p.s. I'll send these as patches in response to this email to lkml for
those who want to see them.
