I think this is nonsense. The block layer will not accept commands
that it cannot handle in one go, what would the point of that be?
There's no way for us to break down a single command into pieces,
we have no idea how to do that. max_sectors _is_ the natural
constraint, it's the hardware limit not something I impose through
policy. For SCSI it could be bigger in some cases, that's up to the
lldd to set though.

ide-scsi bug.

It breaks existing applications too, which is at least a very
good reason in my book. I think your position is naive. The
driver explicitly asked not to get request bigger than a certain
size, and know you want to rely on the correct handling of that
case? Won't happen.
BTW, if you want me to read emails somewhat reliably, cc me.
