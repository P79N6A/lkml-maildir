If you do
    DEFINE_PER_CPU(int, foo);
then this ends up defining per_cpu__foo in .data.percpu.  Since 
.data.percpu is part of the init data section, it starts at some address 
X (not 0), so the real offset into the actual per-cpu memory is actually 
(per_cpu__foo - __per_cpu_start).  setup_per_cpu_areas() builds this 
delta into the __per_cpu_offset[], and so it means that the base of your 
%gs segment is at -__per_cpu_start from the actual start of the CPU's 
per-cpu memory, and the limit has to be correspondingly larger.  Which 
is a bit ugly.  Especially since "__per_cpu_start" is actually very 
large, and so this scheme pretty much relies on being able to wrap 
around the segment limit, and will be very bad for Xen.
An alternative is to put the "-__per_cpu_start" into the addressing mode 
when constructing the address of the per-cpu variable.
