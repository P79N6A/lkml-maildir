Hi,
I've been looking into this problem aswell, with lots of help from
Gerald. And it definitely it's due to a funny core_pyxis.c change.
we now map 2GB - 4GB PCI address space to 0 to 2GB
memory address space, and 0-2GB pci space to 2-4GB memory space...
(strange i think).
ie all of the PCI address space is now mapped to memory by the
pyxis chipset, but "cut in 2 and flipped over" rather than
contigiously.
Before we only mapped 1-2GB pci space to 0-1GB memory space.
I noticed that virt_to_phys and phys_to_virt weren't updated. Could
this be the cause? The new mapping doesn't seem 'backwards
compatible' with the old mapping to me.
Best thing to do is back out the changes to
include/asm-alpha/core_pyxis.h and arch/alpha/kernelcore_pyxis.c.

  when the errors began to happen.  
  It could that there is a 164SX specific error.  I might try compiling the
  kernel as a 'generic' kernel.  If that does fix the error then something
  with the 164SX specific code is wack.
  Anyway Gerard has done a lot of work and I thank him!
  Take it easy,
