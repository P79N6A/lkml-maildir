Yes. Although, potentially more clever things could happen in
userspace in the future.

For example.

You /could/ just build every driver into the initrd too, and every
firmware, and... but it might be nice if it was possible to know what
should be where. Right now, we've lost that because decoupling
firmware from the kernel means that tools outside of the kernel can't
tell what firmware files should be around.

I've also repeatedly said that I don't think this really helps with
things like speedtouch since you can't distribute that firmware
anyway. This patch does help people who play nicely with the kernel
who are migrating away from shoving blobs into the kernel (quite
rightly) and who supply redistributable firmware. One example might be
the QLogic driver in my RFC.

You're assuming firmware is always on some random vendor website under
a questionable license and can't be redistributed. That wasn't my
first consideration - this doesn't really help much there, except you
get to know what you don't have :-)
