Ashok,
I did initial testing of Zwane's IA-32 vector sharing patch, which
worked beautifully for the test case I mentioned. Here is the IRQ
snapshot on the same system booted as IA-32 with Zwane's patch applied:

After I applied my patch on top of his patch, the picture became:

So, there is no conflict between the two, and when it's fully
implemented, tested, and incorporated into the source (and into x86_64),
well, we still will have IRQs numbers utilized better per node.

I actually tested the code I'm offering with Zwane's IA-32 vector
sharing patch. By the way, I tested hi
