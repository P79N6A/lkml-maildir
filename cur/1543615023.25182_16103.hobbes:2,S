Yeah... currently. But the sisfb code won't mess up the console any
longer if you use my new driver available at
http://linux-sis630.decode.info
 (eventually with "mode=none").
Together with my patch for the SiS-DRM module (available at the same
place) DRI runs perfectly.
I proposed the driver and the patch to be included in the kernel - yet
unsuccessfully...
