Let's see, on a recent kernel and recent udev I have as directories
under /dev:
- disk, a pure udev creation, so no conflict there
- loop, devices names under that are numeric.  mount has /dev/loop%d
  and /dev/loop/%d hardcoded
- bus/usb, this one collides with itself if flattened
- snd/sound, names except for seq and timer are pretty much line
  noise.  "timer" is scary though.
- net with tun and (I think) tap.
- pktcdvd with "control", not sure what tool uses it
- misc is ok (they're all ex-/dev/xx devices)
- video1394, dv1394, i2c with '0' as device name
- dri with card%d
- cpu which self-collides too
- input with a potentially dangerous event%d
So, well, I think you're going to need directories for usb and cpu
without doubt, and some of the rest is potentially risky, long-term
wise.
  OG.
