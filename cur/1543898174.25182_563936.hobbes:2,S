Other than the fact that "configuration" means something very specific
in USB terms, so there would be three of them ... yes.  That's what the
PXA2[156]x UDC hardware does.

There's not much point in merging a driver that only works with one
of what are currently six gadget drivers ... others are on the way.
Yes, the point of working more like PXA2[156]x hardware is that we
know that kind of hardware setup works with everything ... while we
know that every attempt to use the PXA27x magic has failed on some
of those drivers.  (By all reports, because of hardware bugs.)
