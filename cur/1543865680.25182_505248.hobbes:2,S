Disagree.  The UI app should handle this and ask the user if it's okay
to proceed to enable that option along with the others.
All we should be doing in the Kconfig files is describing the
dependencies for user-visible symbols.  If we want to allow the
user to enable something, it's up to the UI _itself_ to sort out the
dependencies.
Principle of least surprise.  Principle of giving the user control.
As I say at the moment throwing "select" is just moving the bloody
problem around.  It's not actually _solving_ anything, and anyone
who thinks otherwise is a nutcase!
