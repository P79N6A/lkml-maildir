'ethereal' *is* a damned intelligent parser that understands RPC/NFS/... ;-)
You should be able to use its read filtering capabilities to cherry-pick 
exactly the information that interests you.

If you are going to insist on logging using printks, you might as well just 
use the existing RPC debugging code. Just rewrite your printks to the format
dfprintk(BITMASK, format,...)
The value of BITMASK can be whatever you want, although the masks between 
0x0001 and 0x0200 are already used by the existing nfsd debugging code (see 
include/linux/nfsd/debug.h).
Then just 'echo BITMASK >/proc/sys/sunrpc/nfsd_debug' in order to begin 
logging.
