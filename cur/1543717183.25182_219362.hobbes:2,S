Matt and I had discussed this privately sometime ago and I will
send him somewhat cleaned up patches that introduces call_rcu_direct()
which, in UP kernel, invokes the callback directly. The corresponding
read-side critical section will have to protect itself with
rcu_read_lock_bh() or rcu_read_lock_irq() if an update can happen
from softirq or irq context.
