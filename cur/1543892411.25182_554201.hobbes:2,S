When I was doing my stuff, I intended for it to be parsed by a script or
simple command line tools like sort/grep piped through less. I also though
it might be interesting to output the text into either a python or ruby
syntax collect so that it can go through a more extensive sorting using
those languages.
There are roughly about 400 locks in a normal kernel for a desktop. The
list is rather cumbersome anyways so, IMO, it really should be handled
by parsing tools, etc... There could be more properties attached to each
lock especially if you intend to get this to work on -rt which need more
things reported.
