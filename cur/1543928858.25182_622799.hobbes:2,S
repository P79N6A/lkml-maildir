Right. I'm just saying reading a single page out of context (no pun
intended) is not going to be very useful. They need to scan the entire
file, which means that there are limited ways this is practical - it's
not practical to do that on every write into a shared mapping, hence a
solution that scans on open, etc. is probably the best there is.
