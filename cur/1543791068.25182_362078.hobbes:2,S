Maybe you should first pay attention to what I pointed out:  that
the problem reports I've seen have ONLY been on PPC systems.
Like the powerbook in $SUBJECT ... people without PPCs are unlikely
to hit such issues, judging by the evidence so far.  (Though of course
it'd be possible...)

I guess one point to be made is that although x86 gets the most testing
right away, PPC lately isn't far behind.  Latent bugs in usb-handoff
logic got surfaced by this patch ... there could be others.  I suspect
nobody except x86 users have been running that code much at all.
