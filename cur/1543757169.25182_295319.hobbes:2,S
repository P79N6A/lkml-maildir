Audit is being handled by a separate audit framework, not by LSM.  There
is already support in the Linux 2.6 kernel for auditing at syscall exit
(thereby guaranteeing that you capture the final return value in all
cases), with the ability of an LSM to enable such auditing for a
particular event from its hook functions.  Further, there is ongoing
work (see the linux-audit mailing list) for a set of audit-related hooks
that will allow auditing based on object identity and the requested mode
separate from any particular LSM.
