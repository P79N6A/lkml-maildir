I have been bitten by this as well; I have tracked it down to defining
CONFIG_KALLSYMS:
define rule_vmlinux__
        :
        $(if $(CONFIG_KALLSYMS),,+$(call cmd,vmlinux_version))
quiet_cmd_vmlinux_version = GEN     .version
      cmd_vmlinux_version = set -e;                     \
        if [ ! -r .version ]; then                      \
          rm -f .version;                               \
          echo 1 >.version;                             \
        else                                            \
          mv .version .old_version;                     \
          expr 0$$(cat .old_version) + 1 >.version;     \
        fi;                                             \
        $(MAKE) $(build)=init
 Pondering about it, this may be a feature not a bug. Let's assume you have
changed a single function name anywhere - you need to rebuild kallsyms
(ergo vmlinux) for that.
OTOH I do not know if kallsyms include also symbols from modules; if no,
this is indeed a bug.
