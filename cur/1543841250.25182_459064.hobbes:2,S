Sorry, actually gdev is kzalloc()'d (which works exactly kcalloc()
without the check for n*size integer overflows). I was looking at a
much older version of the code.
I still think, however, that memset()'ing to zero is still something
to consider, in the cases where the structure is passed to the routine
(as opposed to when it's _created by_ the routine). The code shouldn't
rely on the awareness of future developers when adding other calls to
these functions.
