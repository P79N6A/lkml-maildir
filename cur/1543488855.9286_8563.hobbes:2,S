The important difference here, IMHO, is that the NDA is limited to the  
time period where the hardware isn't available.
That's extremely different from the typical flame case where the hardware  
has been available for a while, but information is still available only  
under NDA and there's no hope the NDA will *ever* be lifted.
Now, obviously, no NDA would be even better. But remember, by the time  
this stuff gets usable (because you can buy the hardware), the NDA *will*  
have gone away.
