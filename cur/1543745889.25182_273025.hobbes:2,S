ksymoops-2.4.10.tar.gz           Source tarball, includes RPM spec file
ksymoops-2.4.10-1.src.rpm        As above, in SRPM format

patch-ksymoops-2.4.10.gz         Patch from ksymoops 2.4.9 to 2.4.10.
Changelog extract
        * Fix typo in man page.
        * Unlike syslogd, syslog-ng does not prefix lines with ' kernel:'.
          Handle both formats.  Reported by gentoo.
        * Explictly pass --target on calls to nm and objdump.  Resolves
          cases where objdump/nm complain 'File format is ambiguous'.

Some people have reported problems building ksymoops, with unresolved
references in libbfd (htab_create, htab_find_slot_with_hash).  Try
http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/linux/linux-kernel/2002-13/0196.html
 first,
if that does not work, contact the binutils maintainers.  This is not a
ksymoops problem, ksymoops only uses libbfd.  Any unresolved references
from libbfd are a binutils problem.
