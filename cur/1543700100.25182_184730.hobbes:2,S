As in, "ubuf is NOW a dma address ... it wasn't one before that patch,
it was a regular kernel mappped address.  Otherwise memcpy() would
never have worked.  Changing it would break more typical kernels, with
no need for bounce buffering.
The right fix is just to bypass the DMA mapping for root hubs,
as in that 2.6 patch from Russell that I mentioned.  It's the
unmap that was causing trouble, since it clobbered the data
which memcpy() had just stored into that buffer.
