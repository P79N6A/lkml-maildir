I'm confused. What is the consensus on MODVERSIONS around here?
How many people share your views?
I was under the impression MODVERSIONS was a good thing(TM).
If I don't enable CONFIG_MODVERSIONS, then I'll have to recompile my 
out-of-tree modules every time I upgrade the kernel, even if I'm just 
upgrading from 2.6.20.7 to 2.6.20.8, unless I force the insertion.
I also have a few binary modules. If I force the insertion, I won't know 
they have become binary incompatible until they blow up later, or, 
worse, lead to silent corruption.
Please correct any and all misconceptions.
Regards.
