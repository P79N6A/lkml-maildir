Subject: Deadlock with Promise Driver, still in 2.6.9-rc1

This has already been reported I think, but here it is again. In some
bugzilla somewhere this has been incorrectly reported as a software Raid
vs. Promise driver incompatibility; in fact, it appears to be a problem
when both SATA channels are being used at the same time (which obviously
happens a lot with raid!)
How to trigger it:
# cat /dev/sda > /dev/null &
# hdparm -t /dev/sdb &
# hdparm -t /dev/sda &
Now any disk access to either disks is blocked, and in my case, incoming
mail (using qmail) starts piling up processes, and this ends up in lock
up.
