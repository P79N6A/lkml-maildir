- This is the same as 2.6.21-rc3-mm1, except Con's CPU scheduler changes
  were dropped.
  This is for A/B comparison purposes, and because those changes crashed on
  one test setup.
Changes since 2.6.21-rc3-mm1:
-lists-add-list-splice-tail.patch
-sched-remove-sleepavg-from-proc.patch
-sched-remove-noninteractive-flag.patch
-sched-implement-180-bit-sched-bitmap.patch
-sched-implement-rsdl-cpu-scheduler.patch
-sched-document-rsdl-cpu-scheduler.patch
 Removed.
