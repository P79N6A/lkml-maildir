drivers/scsi/scsidrv.o: In function `BusLogic_InterruptHandler':
drivers/scsi/scsidrv.o(.text+0x80f7): undefined reference to
`scsi_mark_host_reset'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
According to a note in the scsi_obsolete.c file, "Once the last
driver uses the new code this *ENTIRE* file will be nuked."
It seems that scsi_obsolete.c has been "nuked" prematurely :)
