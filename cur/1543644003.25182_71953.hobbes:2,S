The weird thing is that it looks like the 16654 loses data on the 
TRANSMIT side.  A FIFO underrun on transmit should never loose data.  A 
16550 works perfectly.  I don't think that this is a over/under run 
problem.  
The problem seems to be related to the RTS/CTS flow control handling.  
The 16654 handles flow control in hardware, but the 16550 does it in 
software (I've verified this with a digital oscilloscope).  I don't 
currently have the equipment to compare when the lines drop and which 
characters are lost.
