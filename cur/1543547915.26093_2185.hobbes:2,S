I have an older Creative Sound Blaster awe32 soundcard, which has worked
fine under many different kernels in the past.  It is one of the older 
models with jumpers, before the ISAPnP models became available.  In the
past, I always set the io, irq, and dma in the menuconfig setup.  
However, I haven't been able to get it to work since that option was 
taken out of menuconfig/xconfig.  I also haven't been able to get it to work
by loading the module by hand, passing it the correct io, irq, and dma
values on the command line.  
With test7, things got odder.  If I 
insmod uart401
insmod sb_lib
insmod sb io=0x220 irq=5 dma=1
I get a "No such device" error.  However, if I cat /proc/interrupts, 
the Soundblaster shows up as using irq 5.  If I subsequently unload
the sb_lib module and try to cat /proc/interrupts, I get this:
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address c983f474

If I play with the modules more, I can usually make it so I can cat
/proc/interrupts again, but irq 5 shows up as used but sometimes instead of
showing as used by soundblaster, it has a blank where it would normally give
the device name.
The one thing that I suspect might be related to this is that I have had
some problems with odd APIC stuff on this motherboard (Abit bp6 with 2 
celeron 533's).  However, my soundcard does work in this machine using 
kernel 2.2.16.
I'm not currently subscribed to lkml, but I'm curious to know if 
other people have seen similar problems with the older sb/awe32 cards.  Also,
why was the option to set the card up in the menuconfig/xconfig taken out?
Something to do with the driver re-organization?
I'm running modutils 2.3.14, kernel was compiled with gcc 2.95.2, the rest
is a fairly up-to-date debian woody system.  If anyone else has seen this, 
or solved this problem, I'd love to hear from them.  Thanks.
