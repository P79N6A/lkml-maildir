Hi,
I have been having problems with the ncr53c8xx SCSI device driver
since kernel 2.2.0 and it has finally got to the point that I can
no longer stand not having a CD-ROM drive in Linux.
(At the moment, I am forced to load 'doze in order to use my
CD-ROMS for anything more than 2 minutes or so.
Which is annoying in the major)
Anyway, here's what is wrong...
Any time I try to use my SCSI cd-roms under linux (currently 2.2.4 vanilla)
they work for around 300-600Mb of transfers before they stop and the
entire SCSIbus resets.
Here is the excerpt from /var/log/messages for the last time I tried
dd if=/dev/sr0 of=test.imagefile
(Which failed with /dev/sr0:Input/Output Error)

Umm, any more information needed? If so, e-mail me.
If anyone has any idea why since 2.2.x the ncr support no longer works,
I would appreciate some pointers as to how to fix it.
I need my linux control over the SCSI as I want to use a cdwriter, and
having to burn CD's under 'doze will be unbearable
Many thanks in advance
Daniel Silverstone
