   We have a patch floating around that enables unlimited group membership at
   the kernel level, too.  We've never submitted it because it was suggested
   that we were crazy and should just bugger off.   If I thought it might be
   useful and acceptable, we could perhaps make it available in a cleanish
   form.
How do it handle userland backwards compatibility with the existing
stuff?
