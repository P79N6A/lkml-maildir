Subject: IDE Auto-Geometry Resizing support missing in 2.6.7?

Hello Kernel Developers,
I have just updated from 2.6.6 to 2.6.7. I need to use the IDE 
Auto-Geometry Resizing support on my system (CONFIG_IDEDISK_STROKE). The 
corresponding configuration option however was removed in 2.6.7 along 
with the define in the .config file. Thus when booting my hard disks are 
not properly detected (only with the clipped capacity).
Was the removal of this option intentional? Was the option renamed or moved?
