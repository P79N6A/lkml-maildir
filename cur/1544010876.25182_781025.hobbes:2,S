Hi!
What is the physical memory limit for 64-bit Linux? I read about 40 bit 
address bus for AMD Athlon X2 (1 TB) and 48 bit for Barcelona X4 (256 TB).
Is 64-bit linux able to use that amount - provided that one would manage to 
build it into a machine? Or does it have a lower limit?
Looking into the Google crystal ball gives unclear pictures... I tend to 
assume that Linux would handle it, but I am not sure.
Ciao,
