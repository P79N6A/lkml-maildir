This issue has been through a couple of iterations and the current scheme
where if you have SELinux enabled, it is on by default, is aimed at being
more secure by default.  On some platforms, boot parameters are not
feasible.  To allow SELinux to be disable for these, the /selinux/disable
node was implemented, which allows SELinux to be unregistered during boot.  
I suggest you investigate using this; look at what Fedora does.
