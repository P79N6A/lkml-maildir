How broken is the driver than ? What are the implication's if the driver is 
left as it is for now ?

This driver was initially intended only for i386 arch. Furthermore at that 
time when this driver was finalized amd64 wasn't available.

If you have happen to have a list of issues with this current driver 
together with supporting information to back up those claims, please 
forward them to so that I can escalate those issues into Adaptec via the 
appropriate communication channel. I happen to have a number of contact's 
within Adaptec myself.
By the way I've hack the script file to make Adaptec I2O Option to appear 
in Linux 2.6.0 Kernel Configuration tool. Currently I'm now in the middle 
of recompiling the kernel using current dpti2o driver support but haven't 
got to the dpti2o driver yet.
