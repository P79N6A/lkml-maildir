Oh, Alexander your patch conflicts (well, not strictly but causes
patch(1) to spew warnings) with the one I just wanted to send to Linus 10
minutes ago... maybe you could merge it into yours and re-send to Linus?
Mine is obvious, see below (vfs_permission does have enough to fail with
EROFS on a readonly fs for files/directories/symlinks and truncate(2) is
undefined beyond them):
