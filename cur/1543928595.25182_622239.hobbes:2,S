No, it does not match this:
	/* Bit used for the pseudo-hwcap for non-negative segments.  We use
	   bit 1 to avoid bugs in some versions of glibc when bit 0 is
	   used; the choice is otherwise arbitrary. */
	#define VDSO_NOTE_NONEGSEG_BIT	1
You really want "hwcap 1 nosegneg" given that.
Yes, we've been over this several times already.
Thanks,
Roland
