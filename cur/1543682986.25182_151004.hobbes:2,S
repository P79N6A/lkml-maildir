    Just curious.
    Is there any way to guess inline from inline?
    I mean 'inline' which means 'this has to be inlined or it will 
break' and 'inline' which means 'inline this please - it adds only 10k 
of code bloat and improve performance in my suppa-puppa-bench by 0.000001%!'
    Strictly speaking - separate 'inline' to 'require_inline' and 
'better_inline'.
    So people who really care about image size - can turn 
'better_inline' into void, without harm to functionality.
    Actually I saw real performance improvements on my Pentium MMX 133 
(it has $i16k+$d16k of caches I beleive) when I was cutting some of 
inlines out. and I'm not talking about (cache poor) embedded systems...
