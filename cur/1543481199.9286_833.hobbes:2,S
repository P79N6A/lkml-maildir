I don't believe anyone was suggesting that.  I'm guessing that Linus will
choose to release whatever he wants.  I was under the impression that the
purpose of this process was to bring ideas to the table so Linus could make his
own decision.

"NTFS-format hard disks"?  Ugh.  Why not NTFS partitions or NTFS disks?

"Technical users" still bothers me.  I like Peter's suggestion of "This update
is available from <blah>" better.

I missed something here. =)

I still have problems with Y2K crap, but if that's what people wanna hear....

Definte "internet group" for me.

This is very awkward sounding.  I've heard statements like it before, but
I don't necessarily think this is the best way to do it.  How about "25 percent
of all web sites run on Linux servers" or something to that effect.

Ugh... too many "mission critical"'s.  And get rid of "He or his coauther
[sic]."  Besides spelling "author" in a nonstandard way, this sounds really
awkward.  I would simply get rid of the first quote entirely.
When two people write an article, you refer to _both_ of them as having written
it, not either.  Both are responsible for the entire article, so you assume
they collaborated on every word.

I like this a lot.
I'm nitpicking, but you can only make a press release once.  Better for it to
be perfect, if such a thing can be achieved. =)
