Subject: PROBLEM: booting from 3w-9000 RAID array

1. Cannot boot from /dev/sda2 and /dev/sda3 with 3w-9xxx driver from 2.6  
kernel series. Booting from /dev/sda1 looks to work.
2. I have a 3w-9000 and the following partitions:
/dev/sda1 on /boot type ext3 (rw)
/dev/sda2 on / type ext3 (rw)
/dev/sda3 on /mnt/debian type ext3 (rw)
/dev/sda4 on /homes/hirst/dsk1 type ext3 (rw,noatime,data=writeback)
/dev/sdb1 on /homes/hirst/dsk2 type ext3 (rw,noatime,data=writeback)
On WhiteBox Linux 3.0. Bootloader is grub (GNU GRUB 0.93) installed in  
/dev/sda.
The 2.4 drivers that 3ware provides work fine (both with custom and pre  
compiled redhat kernels).
But if i use a 2.6 kernel with a builtin driver i get a:
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(8,2)
The strange thing is that if i use sda1 as root (801) it's able to mount  
root fs (but obviously fails,
because it doesn't find init). If i try the same using the driver as  
module and initrd the error is in:
pivot_root: no such file or directory.
I tried both stock kernel from kernel.org (2.6.9) and debian  
2.6.8-1smp(precompiled with module driver).
It looks like the driver recognizes the disks during boot (i get some  
output about 3w-9xxx founding sda and sdb),
but not the partitions inside the drives (i don't get any output about the  
sda1, sda2, etc...).
3. Keywords - 2.6, boot, 3w-9xxx
4. Kernel version - 2.6.9 and 2.6.8-1smp from debian
