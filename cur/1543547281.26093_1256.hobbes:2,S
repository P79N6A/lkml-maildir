In combination with the new release of the X Windows System, Linux includes drivers to take full advantage of your accelerated video card (nVidia and 3Dfx cards among those supported) to get maximum video performance for gaming, graphics, etc.

support 2.2.x kernels.  If updated drivers do exist, I would definitely
love to hear about them.
