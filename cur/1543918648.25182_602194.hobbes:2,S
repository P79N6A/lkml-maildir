one of the characteristics of the application in use is the following:
all cores submit IO (which means they allocate various scsi and block
structures on all cpus).. but only 1 will free it (the one the IRQ is
bound to). SO it's allocate-on-one-free-on-another at a high rate.
That is assuming this is the IO slab; that's a bit of an assumption
obviously (it's one of the slab things that are hot, but it's a complex
workload, there could be others)
