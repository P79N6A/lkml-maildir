The magic is for C2- and C3-_type_ sleep, and C4 is of type C3... I know,
this numbering is very confusing, but that's the way it is... However, the
sepcially added "magic" for dyntick still needs some tweaking; I'll try to
improve (and hopefully streamline) it a bit. As a first test, could you
remove the "Fast-path demotion" case and re-test?
Thanks,
