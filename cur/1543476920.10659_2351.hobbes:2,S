-COSA/SRP sync serial boards support
-CONFIG_COSA
-  This is a driver for COSA and SRP synchronous serial boards.
-  These boards enable to connect synchronous serial devices (for
-  example base-band modems, or any other device with the X.21, V.24,
-  V.35 or V.36 interface) to your Linux box. The cards can work
-  as the character device, synchronous PPP network device, or the Cisco
-  HDLC network device.
-
-  To actually use the COSA or SRP board, you will need user-space
-  utilities for downloading the firmware to the cards and to set 
-  them up. Look at the 
http://www.fi.muni.cz/~kas/cosa/
 for more
-  information about the cards (including the pointer to the user-space
-  utilities). You can also read the comment at the top of the
-  drivers/net/cosa.c for details about the cards and the driver itself.
-
-  The driver will be compiled as a module ( = code which can be
-  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
-  The module will be called cosa.o. For general information about
-  modules read Documentation/modules.txt.
