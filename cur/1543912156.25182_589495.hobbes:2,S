Your patch switched the nmi from PERFEVTSEL0 to PERFEVTSEL1  (right?)..
So 0 works, 1 does not , for me anyway ..

As far as I can tell the check_nmi_watchdog() doesn't take locks, and it
can't safely share a lock with the NMI .. 
The patch below fixes the hang (not the stuck NMI) .. Not totally sure
why, but the cpus are stuck in a loop waiting for the endflag which
never comes .. This also plays with the nmi hz which might do
something.. /proc/interrupt doesn't show any nmi's either..
