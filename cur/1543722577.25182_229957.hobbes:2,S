Hello there
I'm having 2 problems with nfs atm, I'll first describe the problem of 
the mysterious deadlocks.
On the client that has deadlocked I see these (tcpdump host servername -n)
11:37:31.272353 IP 137.215.40.16.3750658894 > 137.215.98.25.2049: 140 
read [|nfs]
11:37:32.671933 IP 137.215.40.16.3717104462 > 137.215.98.25.2049: 140

read [|nfs]
On the server I get lots and lots of these (tcpdump host clientname -n)
11:39:23.239369 IP 137.215.40.16.3733881678 > 137.215.98.25.2049: 140

The port numbers are *obviously* wrong, but I suspect this is a tcpdump 
problem.  What worries me is that it doesn't look like the packets from 
the server reaches the client.  Now unless there is someone playing 
around on the routers (which might well be the case) or the routers is 
just messed up, then this means that there is a problem in the 
networking code - unlikely since all other services are still 
functioning, or I'm doing something wrong.  My fstab line looks like:
phugeet.cs.up.ac.za:/home/ /home/phugeet        nfs     defaults,sync   0 0
Whilst my exports file contains:
/home 137.215.40.19(no_root_squash,rw,sync)
My question then is this - why can't tcpdump get the port numbers on 
those latter packets?  Then also, shouldn't the source port numbers for 
these also be 2049?  Once this starts happening I can't fix anything 
without rebooting - or I haven't figured out how to yet.  Also, I cannot 
umount the mount, not even with -f (k, correction, at least doing a 
umount -f causes all "deadlocked" processes to be shot down, after which 
a second umount -f actually umounts the mount).
Right, now for the disappearing directory entries:
(client):
oasis home # mount
/dev/rd/host0/target0/part1 on / type ext3 (rw,noatime)
none on /dev type devfs (rw)
none on /proc type proc (rw)
none on /sys type sysfs (rw)
none on /dev/pts type devpts (rw)
/dev/rd/host0/target0/part3 on /usr type reiserfs (rw,noatime)
/dev/rd/host0/target0/part5 on /tmp type reiserfs (rw,noatime)
/dev/rd/host0/target0/part6 on /var type reiserfs (rw,noatime)
/dev/rd/host0/target0/part7 on /home type reiserfs (rw,noatime)
none on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw)
phugeet.cs.up.ac.za:/home/ on /home/phugeet type nfs 
(rw,sync,addr=137.215.98.25)
oasis home # ll /home/phugeet/courses
total 0
(server):
phugeet home # mount
/dev/hda2 on / type ext3 (rw,noatime)
none on /proc type proc (rw)
none on /sys type sysfs (rw)
none on /dev/pts type devpts (rw)
none on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw)
none on /proc/bus/usb type usbfs (rw)
phugeet home # ls /home/courses

The options are the same as above.
Any help, or any other pointers will be much appreciated thanks.
