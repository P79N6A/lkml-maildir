It's the 'single node' part that concerns me.  As long as that node is 
ensuring there is consensus behind the scenes before handing out said 
signature.  Otherwise you can't be sure you're not getting an old 
signature for old data..
This is more or less what I ended up doing.  Since the workload is 
mostly-read, the paxos leader gives non-leaders leases to process reads in 
parallel, and new elections or state changes wait if necessary to ensure 
old leases are revoked or expire before any new leases on new values are 
issued.
