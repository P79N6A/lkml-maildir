Where would I increase the hash size if I wanted to increase the number
of bindings by an order of magnitude or so?  I'm very interested in
pursuing this possibility, because when combined with the procedure I
described earlier, plus a little bit of extra work with capabilities 
and such
it's very easy to build incredibly flexible and basically indestructible
chroot environments with not much code.
