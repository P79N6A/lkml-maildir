Hi,
I just upgraded from test7 to test9, now the pppoe (to be precise, pppox on 
which pppoe depends)  module segfaults when loaded with modprobe the first 
time, a second attempt causes lots of disk activity and eats up all processor 
time, eventually locking me out of my system (no oops, though, so I guess 
it's actually modprobe that crashes).
I use modutils 2.3.14, and I got pppox device nodes in my /dev on major 144 
from a different pppox module, a third-party pppoe implementation that was 
partly user and partly kernel based as opposed to the all-kernel 2.4.0 
solution. As everything works fine with test7 I wonder what has changed in 
test9. What could be wrong here? Any ideas?
Thanks,
Mirko
