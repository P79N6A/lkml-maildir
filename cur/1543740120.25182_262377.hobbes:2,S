This is running at system resume, so it is not normal boot. Some ASUS
Athlon 900MHz machine needed this; I'm no longer using this one.

Ok, this one is bad... ... In case of just one vga adapter, we should
be able to store its parameters in some well-known place. For more
than one adapter, we'll definitely need to run BIOS in emulator.
