What is that parameter?  The size, I assume.   To do that you'd
need to create different pools for different allocation sizes.
Bear in mind that mempool only makes sense with memory objects
which have the special characteristic that "if you wait long enough,
someone will free one".  ie: BIOs, nfs requests, etc.   Probably,
DMA buffers fit into that picture as well.
If anything comes out of this discussion, please let it be the 
removal of the hard-wired GFP_ATOMIC in dma_alloc_coherent.  That's
quite broken - the interface should (always) be designed so that the
caller can pass in the gfp flags (__GFP_WAIT,__GFP_IO,__GFP_FS, at least)
