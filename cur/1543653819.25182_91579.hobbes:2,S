Hello,
I have an ASUS CUV266-DLS motherboard, with an agp-bridge which I think
is supposed to be supported. But it isn't. This is with 2.4.20-rc1, but
I've tried 2.5.47 as well, and haven't seen anything that should have
changed in 2.4.20-rc2 or 2.5.48. 
Based on agpgart interface v0.99 (c) Jeff Hartmann
agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 439M
agpgart: Unsupported Via chipset (device id: 3091), you might want to
try agp_try_unsupported=1.
agpgart: no supported devices found.
I have tried with agp_try_unsupported=1, but no luck. I have seen that
in pci_ids.h this device id is defined to vt8633, so I suppose it should
work. I would really like to know why it doesn't...
Regards,
Stian Jordet
