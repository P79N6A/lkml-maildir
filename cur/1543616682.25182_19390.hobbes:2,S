I have changed almost all of the instances of if(blah) BUG(); in 2.5.2-pre11 
to use if(unlikely(blah)) BUG(); or the macro BUG_ON(blah); if anyone would 
like this I can give you your portion.  It actually does make a difference, 
if there is a gcc op likely(blah) then for the remaining if(blah) digahole; 
else BUG(); will be chainged soon as well.
I hope that this makes sense as it was a fairly trivial change, it just took 
a while as everyone writes the BUG(); stuff differently.
Craig.
