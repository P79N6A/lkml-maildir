it might be possible to use ordered writes on one side and ordered reads
on the other side to fix this instead of spinlock. I suggested to use my
spinlock-by-hand idea to fix it in 2.4 (like I previously did with
mod_timer), but we might try to do something more efficient in 2.6 if
you've some idea. I don't think it matters much anyways since the
cacheline wouldn't be exlusive anyways if we get into the above path,
and the above isn't the common path, but maybe it does. I think the
unified way of locking with mod_timer/add_timer/del_timer I'm currently
used is simple and clean, but if you see any significant performance
advantage we can change it of course.
If my last email where I analyzed the problem in more detail is not
clear or you see fault please let me know of course.
thanks,
Andrea
