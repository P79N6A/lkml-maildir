After I commented out the "append hdc=ide-scsi" line in /etc/lilo.conf 
and rebooted,
the /dev/hdc device does show up.  I was able to begin burning a CD with 
cdrecord using
cdrecord -v dev=/dev/hdc -audio -pad filename.wav.   However, in the 
middle of the burning
process, I experienced a hard lock up in which the machine did not 
respond to switching virtual consoles with
CTRL+ALT+F2.      This lockup has happened to me twice now, and I am 
still testing to determine if this
is a problem in cdrecord or a linux kernel issue with 2.6.9.
