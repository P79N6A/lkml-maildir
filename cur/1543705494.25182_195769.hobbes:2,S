Ok,
Im sorry for misinformation ... I better just keep on reading not 
writing :).
But anyway. The thing that mislead me is that I would expect to get 
"already mounted" message if  I tried to mount the drive to the same 
mountpoint again.(at least i get it if i try to do it with read-only 
mounted xfs. i cant try it with iso9660 on cdr).
