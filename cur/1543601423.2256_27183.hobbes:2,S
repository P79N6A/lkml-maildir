Well, seeing that I had added ->host in the first place... yes, they were
intended to be cookies rather than inode pointers.  Precisely because of
block device applications.  Overridden by Linus several months down the road
and yes, I still think that it was bogus.
Anyway, _if_ we have to have an inode somewhere, we'd better make sure
that it's not a reuse of inode passed by open().  Otherwise we are in for
a lot of fun.
I could live with something similar to the net/socket.c and fs/pipe.c schemes
- minimal superblock and inodes allocated on it.  But then we'd better be
consistent and do that for _all_ uses of blkdev_get().
