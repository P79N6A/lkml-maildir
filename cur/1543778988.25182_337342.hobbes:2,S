The advantages are:
- reducing the number of supported gcc versions from 8 to 4 [1]
  allows the removal of several #ifdef's and workarounds
- my impression is that the older compilers are only rarely
  used, so miscompilations of a driver with an old gcc might
  not be detected for a longer amount of time
My personal opinion about the time and space a compilation requires is 
that this is no longer that much of a problem for modern hardware, and 
in the worst case you can compile the kernels for older machines on more 
recent machines.
