In fact MOST Linux systems out there works as unattended servers or as
desktop system which is VERY similar to unattended server: person in front
of terminal usually just does not have deep enough knowleadge to play with
top, ps or whatever.

Security exploits can be fixed remotely and hdd/fan/whatever do not crash
every day as well.

Most sysadmins I've seen here are "partial sysadmins": they setuped some
system and it should work for months without attention. If something goes
wrong they will be called (by phone: systems are NOT connected to internet
by persistent basis). Of course there are exist banks and such where
maintaining goes on 24x7 sysadmin basis but it's other story: Linux is not
used there at all (Solaris or AS-400) so it's not relevant to discussion.
P.S. Do you really want to babysit your web-enabled toaster with web interface ?
Software exploits are rare (VERY limited set of software), hardware failure
is even more rare but apache CAN go nuts. Linux going on such devics as well...
Let 0.1% minority who CAN babysit server to patch kernel and remove OOM-handler,
not other way around...
