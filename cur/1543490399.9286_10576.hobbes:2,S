Ik, it seems that the machine was running fine for about 4 days and now
I'm looking at it today and their are 54 stuck connections :<
I don't know if your patch helped at all or if some network/user condition
mearly shifted to hide the problem for 4 days.
It is odd, according to my mrtg graphs I'd say that most of these appeared
in the last 20 hours, outbound traffic levels steadally decreased as the
ftp user limit filled with inactive ftpds
Sorry,
Jason
