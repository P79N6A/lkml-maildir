Ahh, yeah I guess that would be the more common case. I was just
thinking of just randomly reading past the end of the file - in
that case it *would* fall through to ->readpage if the page wasn't
in cache.
But anyway, I think we agree my (our) version should cover that.

OK - maybe that can go for a spin in the next -mm. Andrew did you

Yeah I guess it is a case of doing the minimum that is really
needed.
Although considering page_cache_readahead call can do an i_size_read,
it might be nicer to probably change the interface to have it passed down
instead
