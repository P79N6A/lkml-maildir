The issue might be that these people are using
	hdparm -S xxx
	or
	hdparm -y / -Y
while a much better way to do
	hdparm -B 63
The -S option should in theory be safe, but I remember some drives did
behave unpredictably if this was used. -y/-Y is much tougher and some
drives will not work reliably unless first woken up manually before
issuing a read/write request.
On the other hand, -B is pretty safe on drives that support it, and all
IBM notebook drives do.
