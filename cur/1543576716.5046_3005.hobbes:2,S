Is it possible you compiled the kernel with gcc 2.95.2?  I've been having
a similar problem, but I'm having trouble tracking it down.  Because I
normally use a very heavily modified 2.2.18 kernel, I'm trying to isolate
just where the problem is - I have no problems with a stock 2.2.18 kernel.
If I compile with gcc 2.7.2.3 it works fine.
Cheers, Andreas
