do you know you don't have to operate in OOM-slaughter mode?
"vm.overcommit_memory = 2" in your /etc/sysctl.conf puts you 
into a mode where the kernel tracks your "committed" memory 
needs, and will eventually cause some allocations to fail.
this is often much nicer than the default random OOM slaughter.
(you probably also need to adjust vm.overcommit_ratio with 
some knowlege of your MemTotal and SwapTotal.)
