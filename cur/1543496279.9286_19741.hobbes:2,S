Subject: [2.2.9] performance problem on 100MBit network

Hello,
using 2.2.9 on my server or my client brings down the performance
on my local network. I'm using SMC Etherpower II on both machines
which are connected via a 100MBit hub.
Using ftp the transferrates drop to ~200 k/s (>6 M/s with 2.2.8).
If I revert the following part of patch-2.2.9 the network runs at
full speed again:
diff -u --recursive --new-file v2.2.8/linux/include/net/tcp.h linux/include/net/tcp.h

 {
-       __u32 snd_wnd_packets = tp->snd_wnd / tp->mss_cache;
+       __u32 snd_wnd_packets = tp->snd_wnd / max(tp->mss_cache, 1);
 
        return max(min(snd_wnd_packets, tp->snd_cwnd) >> 1, 2);
 }
What is the reason behind this patch or can I tune my system
using /proc/sys/net ?
Regards,
   Jogi

Well, yeah ... I suppose there's no point in getting greedy, is there?
