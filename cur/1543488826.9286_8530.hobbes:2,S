Erm, yes and no.

Well, yes, but not in the way you describe.

No, you have 4 main partitions, which may be either "primary" or
"extended". They are numbered 1 to 4. Changing a primary to an
extended does not change the partition numbers for the main
partitions.
The subpartitions within extended partitions are called logical
partitions, and they start counting from 5. There is the potential for
these to be renumbered, if you change a primary partition to an
extended partition (where there is another extended partition after
it). The logical partitions in the second extended partition will be
renumbered.
So, the only problem you should have is if you create *two* extended
partitions and populate them both. While this is a potential problem,
I don't think it really matters because there isn't much point to
having multiple extended partitions. A single extended partition can
hold plenty of logical partitions.
