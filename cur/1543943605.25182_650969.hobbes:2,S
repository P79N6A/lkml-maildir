to be honest, I doubt idea of generic reservation framework.
end up, we hope drop the application cache, not also dataless memory.
but, automatically drop mechanism only able to drop dataless memory.
and, many application have own memory management subsystem.
I afraid to nobody use too complex framework.
What do you think it?
I hope see your API. please post it.
Thanks!
