Well, that's what the _comments_ in <linux/kdev_t.h> say:
| However, for the time being we let kdev_t be almost the same as dev_t:
|
| typedef struct { unsigned short major, minor; } kdev_t;
But the actual definition is
| typedef unsigned short kdev_t;
Which is incompatible with taking the address of a kdev_t object and assuming
it has the same size as an int, which doesn't equal to any of the `admissible
operations on an object of type kdev_t', as per <linux/kdev_t.h>.

So what do you suggest to fix the bug related to sysctl of real_root_dev?
Just disable it completely?
