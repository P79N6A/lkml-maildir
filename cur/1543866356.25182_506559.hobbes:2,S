We should only export kernel interfaces and ufs_fs.h isn't one.  silo
wants it because it defines the ufs format - but the linux structs for
that can and do change, e.g. adding unions when we add support for the
gazillion+1st ufs format variant.  silo should just grab a copy of it
that it's happy with it and update it when it needs to support another
format variant (which I think is a rather theoretical issue as silo
only supports the solaris/sparc format IIR)
