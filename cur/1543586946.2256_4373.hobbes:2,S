Andi, thank you for the background!  More comments interspersed...

I see your point here, but need to think about it.  One question:
isn't it the case that the alternative to using synchronize_kernel()
is to protect the read side with explicit locks, which will themselves
suppress preemption?  If so, why not just suppress preemption on the read
side in preemptible kernels, and thus gain the simpler implementation
of synchronize_kernel()?  You are not losing any preemption latency
compared to a kernel that uses traditional locks, in fact, you should
improve latency a bit since the lock operations are more expensive than
are simple increments and decrements.  As usual, what am I missing
here?  ;-)

Another approach would be to define a "really low" priority that noone
other than synchronize_kernel() was allowed to use.  Then the UP
implementation of synchronize_kernel() could drop its priority to
this level, yield the CPU, and know that all preempted tasks must
have obtained and voluntarily yielded the CPU before synchronize_kernel()
gets it back again.
I still prefer suppressing preemption on the read side, though I
suppose one could claim that this is only because I am -really-
used to it.  ;-)
                              Thanx, Paul
