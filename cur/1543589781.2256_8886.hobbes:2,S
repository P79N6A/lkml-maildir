Possibly .. if so that's the answer. But the man page doesn't say so:
          tained in the descriptor sets, which may be zero if the
          timeout expires before anything interesting happens.  On
          error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately;
I assumed that "error" is something like trying to  watch for a
negative number or zero descriptors, or having a fd_set that doesn't
contain open fd's. The reason I assumed that is because EINTR is not
listed as a possible:
ERRORS
       EBADF   An invalid file descriptor was given in one of the
               sets.
       EINTR   A non blocked signal was caught.
       EINVAL  n is negative.
       ENOMEM  select was unable to allocate memory for  internal
               tables.
But I'm willing to give it a try! Thanks!
Now back to your regularly scheduled programs ...
