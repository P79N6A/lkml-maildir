I forgot to mention: while I agree with some/many of these points,
especially with regards to recovery, I'd also like to note that the 
patch was mailed in two independent parts:  
-- a number of generic infrastructure routines, all in a ppc64 patch, and
-- the code that actually performs the recovery, as a patch to 
   the drivers/pci/hotplug subsystem.
While the actual recovery code is controversial (e.g. no support of 
scsi recovery), I'd like to at least get in the the generic 
infrastructure pieces.
