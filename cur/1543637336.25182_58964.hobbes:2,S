It works in my system and `umount` is version 2.10o
umount: umount-2.10o
It works because (strace output), umount does the LOOP_CLR_FD ioctl().
munmap(0x400aa000, 4096)                = 0
oldumount("/mnt")                       = 0
open("/dev/loop0", O_RDONLY)            = 3
ioctl(3, LOOP_CLR_FD, 0)                = 0
close(3)                                = 0
If you don't have such an `umount`, loop will remain active, preventing
the module from being unloaded.
