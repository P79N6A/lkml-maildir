I'm working on porting a hibernation patch from 2.4.9-34 (RH) to 2.4.22 
for toshiba laptops - which is based on pnpbios code.  Thus i'm pretty 
much interested in any pnpbios patch which a) works b) can be aplied with 
little fuss to 2.4.22 and c) doesn't contain extra frills (ie just 
pnpbios).  Unfortunately the latest RH kernels seem to have dropped 
pnpbios support and it's not present in the mainstream kernels, the best 
I've found so far is 2.4.22-ac - i'll probably strip it and see if it 
works (the stripping is done, will it work? we'll see tomorrow...)
Cheers,
MaZe.
