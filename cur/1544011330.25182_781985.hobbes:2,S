Have you looked at the number of ENTRY uses for code vs for data?
If all you're after is separating the two uses, then it might be a
smaller patch to change the ENTRY use for data rather than changing
all the ENTRY uses for code.
There are 589 uses of ENTRY in arch/arm/*/*.S.  Of those about 50
aren't called code.
