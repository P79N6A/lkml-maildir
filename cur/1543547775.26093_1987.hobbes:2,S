   They've got some newer stuff.  The best way to get the latest numbers
   would be to call Craig Miller 801-861-7000 (cmiller@novell.com), Dana
   Henriksen (dhenriks@novell.com), same # or Drew Major, Darren's brother,
   same # (rdmajor@novell.com).
This was an amusing progression:
1) Novell has the best web benchmark numbers
2) Oops, I didn't say that, Novell is, go see www.novell.com
3) Oops, that's from nearly 2 years ago, go talk to the engineers
   they have the latest numbers certainly.
I have to be honest and say that I can't take you seriously anymore.
As usual, numbers talk bullshit walks, and when Novell makes some
more up to date specweb submissions, I'll have a look, but until
then it's hot air as far as I'm concerned.
Later,
