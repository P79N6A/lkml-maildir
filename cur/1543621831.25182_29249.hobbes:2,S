But it doesn't seem to have an argument by which you
can tell it to install in for example:
	/somedisk/workdir/cdbuildroot/boot/
instead of:
	/boot
I've got my own equivalent of lk btw... but I don't
use it to install on the *build* machine. I'm building
for CDROM's and into directories that will be tar'd
up and scp'd to other machines that do not have
compilers installed.
