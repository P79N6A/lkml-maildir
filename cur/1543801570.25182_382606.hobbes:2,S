With the three additional patches I've just posted, this leaves:
	ccw_driver
	css_driver
	pcie_port_service_driver
	scsi_driver
using the generic device_driver probe/remove/shutdown/suspend/resume
methods.
I'm not sure what's going on with the PCIE code - my attempts to
contact the PCIE folk about their suspend/resume implementation has
been met by silence.
The scsi_driver business looks like being a pig to solve - so can
SCSI folk please look at what's required to unuse these fields.
Could the s390 folk also look at what's required for ccw_driver and
css_driver please?
