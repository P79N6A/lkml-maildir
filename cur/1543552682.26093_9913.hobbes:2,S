The page sizes are determined by the architecture.
For common Intel chips: 4 kB, 2 MB, 4 MB.
(some restrictions may apply -- Ingo Molnar would know)
For ia64, you get about a dozen different sizes ranging from
the old 4 kB pages up to something like 256 MB.
For the PowerPC you have BAT registers that override page tables.
You get 4 for code and 4 for data, so you can map all physical
memory for the kernel w/o using page table entries or TLB slots.
The SPARC code, if I recall correctly, does not maintain page
tables for normal kernel code. If the virtual address is within
the direct mapped region, a software TLB loader just adds an
offset to get the physical address.
So your modules suffer by being unable to take advantage of
more efficent virtual-to-physical mapping mechanisms.

What, wasted memory is not overhead?
Also, consider the cache effects. To keep things simple, assume
you have a highly modular kernel and that modules are 2 kB.
Also, you have separate 4-way 16 kB L1 caches for code and data.
Well, you now have an 8 kB cache for code, along with 8 kB of
useless transistors.
Of course this is bad, even if you don't have modules that are
exactly 2 kB.

Somebody else posted their numbers: you waste about 15% of memory.
