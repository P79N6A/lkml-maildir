MS's attempts to have their cake and eat it in the security area, are
breathtaking.  On the one hand they tout NT as a nice secure desktop
environment, with zero-administration kits etc etc.  On the other hand,
whenever someone discovers yet another security hole allowing user X to
become an administrator, they wheel out a marketroid to say (this happened
two weeks ago, wish I'd kept the URL) "well, since most desktop users are
local admins of their workstation anyway, it's an academic point".
Hell, on our site, the _only_ reason people are admins of their local PC is
so they can install patches to Office 97, which needs (duhhhh) admin
privileges to install or update.
