You can't select libata drivers without the SCSI core. However, you can 
select libata drivers without the SCSI disk (sd) or the SCSI CD (sr) 
drivers. However, that's a legitimate configuration as you may have only 
hard disks, only CD drives, etc. and there would be no need to build the 
other module. This isn't a major problem for most standard 
configurations as those drivers are needed to handle things like USB and 
FireWire flash drives, external HDs/optical drives, etc. anyway.
