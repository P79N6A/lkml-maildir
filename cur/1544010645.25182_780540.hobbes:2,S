I notice the timer interrupts is quit high on the 2.6.28-rc8 kernel in my Nehalem machine. 
A, 180+/second timer interrupts in my Nehalem machine with tickless enable. 
B, the timer interrupts reduce to 10-/second with tickless and highres enable. 
On 2.6.27 kernel, the timer interrupts can keep low with tickless kernel whenever the highres feature is enable or not. 
So it is timer bug on my machine?
