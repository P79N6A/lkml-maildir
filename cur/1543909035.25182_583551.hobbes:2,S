Err, ok this is the second fix for this patch. I hope it is the last. It
doesn't make any sense to have hash_size be defined as sector_t. Same goes for
max_buckets.

This patch removes the special round_down() to next power of 2 implementation
used only at one place in the snapshot target. It is replaced by an equivalent
1 << fls() which might use an architecture specific implementation.
