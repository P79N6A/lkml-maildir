Parted gives you a lot more than pass/fail.  (Have you read doc/API?

Why?  EVMS's messaging system allows interactive error handling.
Why not use it?

Ah, ok.

Still just defaults... I plan to do an evms-like parameters interface
soonish.  Anyway, implementing it shouldn't present any special problems.
It is orthogonal to the way libparted and libreiserfs interface themselves.

Well, libparted is quite limited and immature, I agree.  But it has
ideas that EVMS doesn't have (and vice versa), so it's useful
("interesting") for us to be looking at each other's code.
I think the way libparted and libreiserfs work together should be
interesting to you... it only enables full reiserfs support when
libreiserfs is installed.  I don't think it's the Final Solution TM...
I think we have a problem of how to handle multiple implementions
of the same thing.  (Which can be useful: for example, reconstructive
vs incremental file system resizers, etc.)  Anyway, I'd like you to
tell me how crap the current libparted <-> libreiserfs thing is,
so I can make it better ;)
