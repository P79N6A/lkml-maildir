you are right, i based my comments on observed behavior, not on the 
code's intentions.
I havent actually traced the behavior of semaphores (being mostly 
interested in mutexes ;-), but fairness algorithms always show up as 
heavy context-switchers on SMP (because other CPUs queue themselves as 
waiters, and wakeups go across CPUs all the time), and i'm quite sure 
that contended scenarios with the current semaphore implementation never 
overscheduled. Hence current semaphores are very likely not fair, and 
sleepers roundrobin back to the queue quite often.
but i've got some measurements of how fairness plays out in practice.  
The mutex based ops go:
 mars:~> ./test-mutex V 16 10
 8 CPUs, running 16 parallel test-tasks.
 checking VFS performance.
 avg ops/sec:               85130
 average cost per op:       206.59 usecs
 average deviance per op:   319.08 usecs
note the 'average latency of an op' (in absolute time), and the standard 
deviation (which has been measured by summing up the deltas between 
subsequent latencies, and divided by the total number of ops).
With semaphores the results go like this:
 mars:~> ./test-mutex V 16 10
 8 CPUs, running 16 parallel test-tasks.
 checking VFS performance.
 avg ops/sec:               34381
 average cost per op:       512.13 usecs
 average deviance per op:   573.10 usecs
look that even though the ratio between the per op cost and the standard 
deviance looks to be a bit better for semaphores, the pure fact that it 
was much slower lengthened its standard deviance to well above that of 
the mutex's.
So even if they are fairer, if the system ends up being slower, fairness 
(==observed fluctuations, and resulting injustices) suffers more as a 
result than due to the queueing logic. I'd chose this 200 +/- 150 usecs 
behavior over 500 +/- 280 usecs behavior - even though the latter has 
smaller relative fluctuations.
(although i'm still unsure which one is fairer, because i couldnt create 
a scenario that is comparable in terms of fairness comparisons: the 
mutex based workloads are always more efficient, and as a result they 
schedule into the idle thread more often, which creates additional noise 
and may be a reason why its standard deviation is higher. The semaphore 
workloads are more saturated, which may flatten its standard deviation.)

hm, removing that wakeup quickly causes hung test-tasks. (i booted an 
all-mutexes kernel, and did the testing on arch_semaphores, using the 
modified semaphore-sleepers.c code. The test ran for a few seconds, so 
semaphores werent _totally_ broken, but there's some clear race in terms 
of not waking up a sleeper.)
and even considering that the current semaphore implementation may have 
a fairness bug, i cannot imagine that making it more fair would also 
speed it up. So it could end up having an even larger performance gap to 
the mutex implementation. But in any case, it should be an interesting 
comparison! I personally find the semaphore implementation clever but 
too complex, maybe that's a reason why such bugs might be hiding there.  
(possibly for many years already ...)
In any case, i concur with you that the fairness design of the two is 
not comparable, and that semaphores _should_ be fairer.
