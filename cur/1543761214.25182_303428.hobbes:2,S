The manpage for read(2) that I've got says
       EFAULT buf is outside your accessible address space.
which is exactly what it would appear
        if (unlikely(!access_ok(VERIFY_WRITE, buf, count)))
                return -EFAULT;
checks for. Assuming this is the check you are bitching about -- you
could be a little more precise if you are going to complain about stuff.
