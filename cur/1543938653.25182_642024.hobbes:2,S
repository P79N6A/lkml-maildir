Dear all,
since some 2.6.24rc version I suddenly experience such messages on
console when trying to shutdown a vpn connection:
unregister_netdevice: waiting for tun0 to become free. Usage count = 1
or when removing an usb wlan dongle (although it was ifconfig wlan0
down'd before)
unregister_netdevice: waiting for wlan0 to become free. Usage count = 1
Then only when all potential connections going over that iface are gone
these messages disappear (sometimes this does not happen and the kernel
then hangs on reboot...)
Is this intended?
