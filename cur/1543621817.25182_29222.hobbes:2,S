hello sir,
I'm new to linux.I'm trying network booting of linux
system.System Conf.(intel 815 chipset ,PXE
bios,3com905c-ethernet card)
In that i'm facing problem with kernel image and it's
file system.
In that when i get the kernel image and filesystem.
It gives me error as
kernel panic : unable to mount root fs on 01:00
Is it necessary to use NFS or is it possible without
that? Any special specification while creating kernel
image and filesystem?
If any body can tell me any doc available on net,i'll
very thankful.
Thanks in Advance..
nimeesh patel
