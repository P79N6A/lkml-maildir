Ah...it looks I should explation why I found this more.
A user (who is migrated from Solaris) met following situation.
==(single threaded program.)
pid1 = fork();
if (!pid1) {
	do_something_forever();
}
....set SIGCHLD handler here to catch pid1's error-exit....
if (!pid2) {
	do_something_in_shortterm();
}
Block SIGCHLD
ret = waitpid(pid2, hoge, hoge); // wait for pid2
UNBlock SIGCHLD
==
And SIGCHLD handler didn't use WNOHANG. 
I asked him to fix his program. He agreed.(So, no problem now.)
While our problem was fixed, it seems Linux doesn't meet spec.(SUSv3)
So I posted. 
But this is rare situation and this fix makes codes ugly....
Thanks,
