Ditto for net drivers... this is my last 'bk pull' request for you,
before we both (presumably) switch to git.
Please do a
	bk pull bk://gkernel.bkbits.net/net-drivers-2.4

   [PATCH] bonding fix
   
   It fixes a stack dump when unloading the bonding module in 802.3ad mode
   if spinlock debugging is turned on, and it was already merged in 2.6.

   [PATCH] pcnet32: 79C975 fiber fix
   
   From: "HARDY, Steven" <steven.hardy@astrium.eads.net>
   
   I have found a bug in the pcnet32 driver (drivers/net/pcnet32.c)
   affecting all ethernet cards based on the AMD79C975 chip, using the
   fiber interface.
   
   It's a one line fix, where some config registers get corrupted during
   initialisation (which stops the Fiber interface working with this chip)
   
   This bug was introduced somewhere betweeen 2.4.17 and 2.6.x (noticed
   whilst upgrading to 2.6), and it may affect other chips too.  I have
   checked all versions up to 2.6.11-bk6 and they are all broken.
