Yes, I forgoht to mention that im running 2.4.18. 
Here is a lsmod of all the relevent stuff I have loaded
root@neptune:~# lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by    Tainted: P
usb-storage            20820   0  (unused)
sr_mod                 11792   0  (autoclean) (unused)

usbview doesnt show mutch more than /proc/bus/usb/devices. The cammera
does show up in red in the left pane though. And I dont have any
/dev/sd* devices. Are you useing the camera in "Normal" usb mode?
somewhere in the setup they have an alternate mode, but dont know what
the difference is.
