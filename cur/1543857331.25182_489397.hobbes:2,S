Out of curiosity: what's the rational of mounting multiple diskless nodes on 
one rw nfs root filesystem [with locking in place]? 
In my experience, this results in a big mess. I depend heavily on diskless 
setups, where I spent significant time to provide sharing as much data as 
possible between the clients _without_ further interference. The best setup 
I found to get there is using unionfs (which still has issues, mostly due 
to missing/broken mmap support).
