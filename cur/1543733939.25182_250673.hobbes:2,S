Well.  That's why I'm keeping the patch alive-but-unmerged.  Waiting to see
who wants it.
There are people who have large machines which are automounting hundreds of
different NFS servers.  I'd certainly expect such a machine to experience
ongoing umount glitches.  But no reports have yet been sighted by this
little black duck.

Could be.  We would give each superblock its own shrinker callback and
everything should balance out nicely (hah).
