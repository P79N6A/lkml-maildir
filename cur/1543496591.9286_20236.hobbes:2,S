Yes. The proc file-system can be mounted multably. You can check this
out if you have a ftp server installed. Presume it's home directory
is /home/ftp. As root do:
cd /home/ftp
mkdir proc
mount proc proc -t proc
Now execute anonymous ftp. You can `chdir` to what now looks like `/proc`
in the chrooted environment and get the directory.
I was able to download `get` cpuinfo even though the ftp message 
said it was 0 bytes. The correct size (on my system) of 722 bytes
was received okay.
Cheers,
