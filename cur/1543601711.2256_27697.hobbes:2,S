ptrace doesn't use down_read_recursive, nor /proc/<>/mem, nor fork.
for /proc/<pid>/maps this check takes care of it of course (or it could
get unfair again: only when we're faulting on our vm we're allowed to go
through):
	if (task == current)
		down_read_recursive(&mm->mmap_sem, &current->mm_recursor);
	else
		down_read(&mm->mmap_sem);
