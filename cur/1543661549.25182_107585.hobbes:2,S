[BUG] Only possible if the argument len == 0.
/u1/acc/linux/2.5.48/fs/xfs/pagebuf/page_buf.c:966:pagebuf_get_no_daddr: ERROR:LEAK:966:966:Memory leak [Allocated from: /u1/acc/linux/2.5.48/fs/xfs/pagebuf/page_buf.c:966:kmalloc]
This function is never called with len == 0
[BUG] Not sure.  Code path is complicated.
/u1/acc/linux/2.5.48/fs/xfs/xfs_da_btree.c:2221:xfs_da_do_buf: ERROR:LEAK:2179:2221:Memory leak [Allocated from: /u1/acc/linux/2.5.48/fs/xfs/xfs_da_btree.c:2179:xfs_da_buf_make]
The code makes me shudder, but there is no leak in here, I chased it
around and all the callers use the right set of arguments to not leak.
[BUG]
/u1/acc/linux/2.5.48/fs/xfs/xfs_dir_leaf.c:651:xfs_dir_leaf_to_shortform: ERROR:LEAK:645:651:Memory leak [Allocated from: /u1/acc/linux/2.5.48/fs/xfs/xfs_dir_leaf.c:645:kmem_alloc]
yep, that's a bug, only happens in forced shutdown of the filesystem.
[BUG]
/u1/acc/linux/2.5.48/fs/xfs/xfs_log_recover.c:1304:xlog_recover_add_to_trans: ERROR:LEAK:1294:1304:Memory leak [Allocated from: /u1/acc/linux/2.5.48/fs/xfs/xfs_log_recover.c:1294:kmem_zalloc]
Also a bug, and we don't need to zero the memory either. 
Fixes for the last two will be in the pipeline with other xfs fixes to
Linus.
Thanks
  Steve
