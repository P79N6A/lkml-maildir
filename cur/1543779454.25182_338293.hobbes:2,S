Would have to disagree with you here. Jens' ATA7 parking code is a great 
start but we still have a couple of issues to address before it's usable 
for this purpose. (1) it only works on a subset of the devices that the 
Windows driver works for, and (2) we need a way to freeze the device for 
a short period so that the next I/O request doesn't wake it up before it 
hits the floor...

If there really are devices with resting values of 20 then I would agree 
we have a problem. I've tried on a few different Thinkpads and have 
always seen resting values of several hundreds. If this is true for all, 
I would like to think we could estimate a sensible value that works for 
everyone...

Jon.
