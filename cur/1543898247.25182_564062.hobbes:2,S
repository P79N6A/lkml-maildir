hm, i tried your test-app and it causes no problems here. (which is not 
a surprise - your app starts a nice +19 busy loop, which is one of the 
common tests i do here too.)
To further debug this, could you try to create a 'high priority shell' 
on a text console (i.e. not under X) that is SCHED_FIFO prio 98? 
Something like:
  chrt -f -p 98 $$
should do the trick. And then run this script:
  
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/cfs-scheduler/tools/cfs-debug-info.sh
before the test, during the test and after the test, from the high-prio 
shell session. (the shell runs at SCHED_FIFO, so the expectation would 
be for that it will be able to run during the test too) Then please send 
me the resulting 3 debug files. Thanks,
	Ingo
