I wonder if this problem can be solved with a generic multi-path layer.
Every time a new Device shows up, it is tested for known volumnes and
re-attached. That way the USB layer can still generate new devices, and the
filesystem layer will not lose the connection to the devices. 
(with the addtional benefit that it also works cleaner for real multipath
server environments)
