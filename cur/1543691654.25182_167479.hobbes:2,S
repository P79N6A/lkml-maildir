But in this case not only will I have to specify the event device Synaptics
is connected to but also explicitly specify _every other_ input device I use
(besides the touchpad I have a track-stick as a separate device and an USB
mouse in my docking station). I will also loose hot-plug capabilities I have 
now for free. 
All in all it just doesn't fly... I wonder if we could declare evdev the master
handler and do not propagate events to the secondary handlers if some process
has appropriate event device opened.
