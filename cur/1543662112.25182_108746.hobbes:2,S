DMA can occur almost anywhere.  If you restrict the area of DMA, that
means you have to copy the contents to the final destination.  I don't think
we want to do that in many cases.

Unless you have some way to mark pages as current DMA targets, you,
you won't be able to do this.  And the problem Ken and I are seeing is
happening after the new kernel has booted. An old DMA operation is
occuring after the new kernel has booted.  That means two kernels would
have to choose the same DMA target areas, and that's fairly unreasonable
to ask, IMHO.
The only reasonable way I can think of to do this is to quiesce the devices
before dumping memory or doing a kexec.  It's not that hard to do, it's just
that a lot of DMA capable device drivers exist that don't do this.
