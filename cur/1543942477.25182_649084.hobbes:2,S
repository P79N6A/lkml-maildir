I refer to this part of documentation:
"The USART behavior when hardware handshaking is enabled is the same as 
the behavior in
standard synchronous or asynchronous mode, except that the receiver 
drives the RTS pin as
described below and the level on the CTS pin modifies the behavior of 
the transmitter as
described below. Using this mode requires using the PDC channel for 
reception. The transmitter
can handle hardware handshaking in any case."
