Subject: initrd code broken in 2.3.33?

Hi All,
I'm trying to compile 2.3.33 with initrd support, since I'd like to load
my SCSI modules ahead of the mount requests. So, after enabling, I can't
compile the kernel anymore:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.3.31/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -fno-strength-reduce  -DCPU=686 -march=i686  -c -o init/main.o init/main.c
init/main.c: In function `start_kernel':
init/main.c:489: `memory_start' undeclared (first use in this function)
init/main.c:489: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
init/main.c:489: for each function it appears in.)
make: *** [init/main.o] Error 1
It seems there is a 'FIXME' comment, which suggests to me that something
new was done to handle discontiguous kernel memory, and this bit (initrd) was
overlooked?
