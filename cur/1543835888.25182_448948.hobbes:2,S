Yes. reiser4 writeouts atoms. Most of pages get into atoms via
sys_write. But pages dirtied via shared mapping do not. They get into
atoms in reiser4's writepages address space operation. That is why
reiser4_sync_inodes has two steps: on first one it calls
generic_sync_sb_inodes to call writepages for dirty inodes to capture
pages dirtied via shared mapping into atoms. Second step flushes atoms.

xattrs is really a problem.
