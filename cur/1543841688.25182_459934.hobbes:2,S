This patch makes do_gettimeoffset() orphan and a resolution of
gettimeofday() will be downgraded to jiffies, unless you add more code
for clocksource infrastructure to MIPS.
If you just wanted to fix the "undefined reference problem", replacing
"tickadj" with 500 (max ntp adjustment time) would be enough.
