Ok, there are two different problems here.  The patch you posted to l-k is
a generic NFS fix for 2.4.5.  ext2 would need this too.
If you are serving NFS from your reiserfs disk, you need an additional
patch on the server only (this is the one I was talking about).  Checkout
the FAQ on www.namesys.com for all the details.
