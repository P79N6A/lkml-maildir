Hmm...I'm actually curious why you called it "backboosting".  In academia
this approach first described in the paper here:
L. Sha, R. Rajkumar, and J. P. Lehoczky. Priority Inheritance Protocols: An
Approach to Real-Time Synchronization. In IEEE Transactions on Computers,
vol. 39, pp. 1175-1185, Sep. 1990.
is referred to as priority inheritance.  Is there significant difference
between your implementation and priority inheritance schemes implemented in
other OSes?  If so, why backboosting?
I was under the impression that pipes and IPC in general are synchronized
using some sort of semaphores/mutex...or does Linux use a different
mechanism for IPC and does away with user space synchronization all together
(e.g. flip-flop buffers with the kernel arbitrating all contention)?  IIRC
processes don't write to X directly and has to send data to X via IPC.  If
some futex derivative is used to synchronize the producers with X, then
making priority inheritable futexes would solve the problem.

Okay enough said, you and Con should get your patches merged into that tree
ASAP if they're ready.
