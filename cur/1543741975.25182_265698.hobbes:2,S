Nope.  The only significant difference between copy_from_user() and
__put_user() here is that copy_from_user() checks that the address is not
in the 0xc0000000-0xffffffff range.  __put_user() skips that check.
So
	if (copy_from_user(kaddr, addr, n))
		fail();
	__put_user(42, addr);
is safe.  We know that the address is in the 0x00000000-0xbfffffff range by
the time we call __put_user().  And if the page at *addr it not writeable
the kernel will take a fault.
So I see no hole.  But I wouldn't have coded it that way...
