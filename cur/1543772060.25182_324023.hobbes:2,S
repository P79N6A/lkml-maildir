One thing to keep in mind is that since now we have support for CPU hotplug
we need to factor in cases when cpu is removed, the per-cpu vectors would
require migrating to a new cpu far interrupt target. Which would 
possibly require vector-sharing support as well in case the vector is used 
in all other cpus.
Possibly irq balancer might need to be revisited as well, and potentially
might trigger some sharing needs.

 - per-cpu vector tables (long back i remember seeing some post from sgi
   on the topic, possibly under intr domains etc.. not too sure)
 - vector sharing
