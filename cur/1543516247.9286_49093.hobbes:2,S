Hi,
I investigated what would be needed to set the RTC when the system 
time changes. First the inverse function for mktime() is needed (i.e. 
convert UNIX time to days, hours, months, etc.) Then the function to 
set the RTC would have to be extended to set _all_ the values, not 
just minute and second.
Should I take the date conversion routine from the C library (i.e. 
copy the code)?
I'm not subscribed here, but I'd like to be CC:'d for replies...
Regards,
Ulrich
