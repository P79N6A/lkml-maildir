I previously had problems with the 2.2.x series of kernels with 'wait_on_bh'
lockups.  Someone tried the acX patch and found that it seemed to fix the
problem, so I applied the 2.2.2-ac7 patch.
Now that I'm running 2.2.2-ac7 it seems that, for no apparent reason, the
system reboots itself (twice a day).  Before the ac7 patch, the system would
run for approximately 5-6 days and then crash with the wait_on_bh message,
but now, it doesn't even last 12 hours without rebooting.  There are no log
messages as to why it reboots .. just the last syslog'd event (which is
different each time), and then the kernel startup messages.
The system is a dual-ppro 200, 512mb ram, aic7xxx ( i believe its the 3940),
AMI megaraid controller, and intel eepro 100 (and running 'vanilla'
2.2.2-ac7)
Any ideas?
Thanks,
  Terry
