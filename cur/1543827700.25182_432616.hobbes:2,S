Wow, this really has helped it seems!
I gave the card to a friend who flashed a different BIOS version into it
 (BIOS 1.4.1.6). This BIOS is old, but even newer than the one which was
 installed before. I had to recreate the RAID array and now dmesg shows me:
hde: Integrated Technology Express Inc, ATA DISK drive
hde: IT8212 Bootable RAID 1 volume.
... and no hdg anymore. I guess that was what i wanted :)
Thank you!
Yours sincerely,
