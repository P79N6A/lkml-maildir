Subject: 2.6.16-mm1 leaks in dvb playback

I've had this problem for a little while (probably since 2.6.14/15
era) but I've only recently spent some time to figure out what's been
going wrong.
There is a patch in the -mm series which causes leaks in both
sock_inode_cache and dentry_cache for me during DVB playback (thanks
to slabtop). 
2.6.16 is fine (no leakage), 2.6.16-mm1 has this problem (~ 2MB/s in
each cache).
I'm using dvbstream and sending the output to /dev/null,  dvb modules
loaded are dvb_usb_vp7045, dvb_usb, dvb_core, dvb_pll.  It's an EHCI USB
device running on a Dell D600 latitude.
turning on some debugging and looking at /proc/slab_allocators and
/proc/page_owners shows that the most prevalent page owners are:
(5363 out of 5631)
Page allocated via order 0, mask 0xd0

I don't normally read LKML so best to Cc me in case I forget :-)  
Many thanks,
