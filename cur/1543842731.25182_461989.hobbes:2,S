Together with stacktrace the infrastructure needed is quite
considerable.

Or the instrumentation patches just always need to check
some global variable. Maybe system_state could be extended or something.

Sorry but moving it into assembler would be just crazy.

Ok I guess it would make sense to add a i386_start_kernel to i386 and
initialize the boot PDA there. I would also move early_cpu_init
into there because that also avoids quite some mess later.
