I'm getting the occasional
Feb  1 13:17:08 yendi kernel: NAT: 0 dropping untracked packet
c3ea4da0 1 146.188.249.73 -> 209.220.232.240
syslog message.  What exactly does it mean?  146.188.249.73 isn't my
machine at all, and 209.220.232.240 is my firewall.  I assume I'm
dropping someone's packets on the floor, but what can cause a packet
to get dropped like that?
