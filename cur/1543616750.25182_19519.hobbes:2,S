	Has anyone out there tried to use linux-2.5.2-pre11/drivers/loop.c?
In my hacked version of loop.c, do_bio_blockbacked is often
called with a bio that has bio->bi_idx set to 1 rather than 0
(and with bi->bi_vcnt == 1), so it thinks it has no transfers to do.
When I add the kludge of doing "bio->bi_idx = 0;" at the beginning
of the routine, then it works fine.
	It is possible that my problem is self-inflicted because I
am using a version that I have adopted the "initial value" patch to,
and I also added a temporary hack to force the requests to be processed
one sector at a time, like so:
        blk_queue_max_segment_size(BLK_DEFAULT_QUEUE(MAJOR_NR), 512);
	However, I think my changes are probably not the cause.  Anyhow,
I thought I should mention this now to see if anyone else can
confirm or refute having similar problems.
