Technically, it isn't bounded.  The field will expand if the value exceeds
4 digits.  
However, these values can't do that.  At least not now.
But, as a good programming practice, snprintf should be used.  Heck, PCI
3.0 might use 32-bit vendor and device values, instead of 8 bit.  So, if
nothing else, do it as insurance for the future.
