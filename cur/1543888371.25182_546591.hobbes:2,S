It won't result in much of a speedup, except in situations where IOMMU 
or other situation that causes you to run into the 64k boundary being an 
issue -- generally only on huge transfers.
A good measure is to dd(1) to/from the block device, rather than using a 
filesystem.  As has been shown on LKML, the filesystem can really slow 
things down in some cases.
