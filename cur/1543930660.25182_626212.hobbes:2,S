What happens on the second iteration of a recursive submission loop is 
exactly nothing, as is right and proper.  The throttling has already 
been done, and all the state necessary to perform the unthrottle was 
recorded in the bio.  Everything seems to be in order there, and the 
algorithm does indeed perform its function as designed, though to be 
sure we have not tested it on -mm branch, only on mainline.
