Oh, we both agree on that, although we used different words.  The
design actually is as simple as outlined, the messy part is getting
the complete call graph of the kernel in the first place.
I have a good deal of that part done, but the code is ugly and there
are legal issues... but it shows that it's quite possible to do.
