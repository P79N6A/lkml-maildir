In that case (because it is non-essential) we can drop that link entirely.
(This means the associated code for the temporary modify_list, the
extra mutex and the kasprintf() stuff can also be dropped too!) I guess
the netconsole_event() notifier could now become simply:
	if (event == NETDEV_CHANGENAME) {
		spin_lock_irqsave(&target_list_lock, ...);
		list_for_each_entry(nt, ..., &target_list, ...)
			if (nt->np.dev == dev)
				strcpy(nt->np.dev_name, dev->name);
		spin_unlock_irqrestore(&target_list_lock, ...);
	}

Yes, that's a good idea, this way we continue to give the information we
were giving previously. We could do this by defining another configfs
attribute of the target's config_item which could then be a proxy for
the char dev_name[IFNAMSIZ] member of the target's underlying netpoll
structure. (this attribute would naturally be read-only from userspace;
sort of similar to what you're doing for the local_mac attribute currently).
Please feel free to discuss anything else regarding this with me off-list,
if you want.
Thanks,
Satyam
