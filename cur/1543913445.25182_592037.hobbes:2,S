I'm talking about benefits for the process (developers, testers) and
the result (end users, dogs eating own food :).

   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   5159478 1005139  406784 6571401  644589 linux-2.6.23-rc4.org/vmlinux
   5131822  996090  401439 6529351  63a147 linux-2.6.23-rc4.gc/vmlinux
Are this numbers show embedded target? I think no. Also time factor of
*10* can be spent more productively reviewing actual code of parts, that
are going to be embedded, no?

OK, thank you very much. Now, describe what problem you are talking
about, please. I see non.
