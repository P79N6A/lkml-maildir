There are some good reasons to add memory.
- disk i/o rates. vmstat will tell you some disk i/o rates, if they are
high you *may* get better performance with more memnory for cache.
- future applications. As you say it's cheap right now, if you think
there's a good chance of larger images, more kernel compiles, whatever,
buy now.
- memory bandwidth. This is very motherboard dependent, read your specs.
Some systems will use two or four way interleave to increase bandwidth
to memory or reduce access time. See what your m/b spec tells you.
- you have the money and want to spend it on {something}! Go ahead,
memory is one of the best investments for any system.
Just remember that to use this memory you need a large memory kernel.
