I've found it's not easily reproducible - I tried to reproduce
again and I couldn't. I've not used my webcam a lot and it's
easy to use it without getting oopses so I have no idea of
since when this bug has been there. I though it was a 
w9968 - which is why I CC'ed luca risolia (the maintainer)
I'll try to reproduce it again.
