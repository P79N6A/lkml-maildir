Can you doctor your scripts to show at least some overview of the IO
patterns?  Just the amount of reads and writes would be a good start,
but something like graphing blktrace output would be wildly instructive.
My first guess would be the known difference between OCFS2's full-block
inodes and ext3's habit of packing lots of inode structs into a block.
Secondary guesses would be lack of directory read-ahead, bad IO patterns
based on allocation policy, etc..
