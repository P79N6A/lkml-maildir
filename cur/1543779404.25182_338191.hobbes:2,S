Hello List,
I am having a problem 2.6.13rc4 described below on a HP Pavilion N5430 
laptop.
1) If I cold boot with only 'lacpi' to run level 3 - shortly after I get
the login prompt the laptop freezes.
2) If I cold boot with 'lacpi  acpi=off  pci=noacpi,usepirqmask'  the
system boots and does not freeze but  when I try to play sound I get no
interrupts from my sound card.
3) If I now warm boot from step  2 with only 'lacpi' my  laptop seems to
be stable  and I have sound.
I did this several times to try and really verify the above scenarios.
Diff between dmesg output from step 1 and step 3

What is the best way to debug a hang? I there a way to turn on verbose
debugging at boot? Also why would
the hardware capabilities be different between a cold boot and a warm boot?
Thanks for any advice,
Steve
