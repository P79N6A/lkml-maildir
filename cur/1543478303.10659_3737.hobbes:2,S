All you need to use a C++ module is the header file which is included with
the #include parameter.  The C++ class libraries could be placed in a
library  Obviously if you change the interfaces you would have to recompile
you source so that the compiler know what has changed.  If you have changed
to class source you would have to recompile the library as well; but you
also have to do this in any other language, unless it is partially or fully
interpited.  By the way this is the exact same behavior of Turbo Pascal.
