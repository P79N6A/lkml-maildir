First of all, does it swap out and stay swapped out, or does it swap in and
out constantly?
What kernel version are you running?
The cache, or pagecache is at the core of Linux' memory management.  When
you start an application (or process) it first maps the file into the cache,
and then executes it.  So the cached value also counts the parts of the
files used recently.  It gets much more complicated, but you're invited to
learn more about it.  I'm sure someone else can give you a few URLs with
more details.
