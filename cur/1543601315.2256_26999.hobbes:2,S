One argument for reverse mappings is distributed shared memory or
distributed file systems and their interaction with memory mapped files.
For example, a distributed file system may need to invalidate a specific
page of a file that may be mapped multiple times on a node.
This may be a naive argument given my limited knowledge of Linux memory
management internals.  If so, I will refrain from posting this sort of
thing in the future.  Let me know.
