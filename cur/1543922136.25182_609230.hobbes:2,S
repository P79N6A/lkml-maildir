err wait, the motherboard I am having is also via based. however the
m15w workaround just slowed down everything but the problem still
appeared.
also to be sure that it is really some problem related to the particular
seagate drive vs. sil3114 I created a 200G file of zeros on one of the
known to work seagates. and indeed it was all zeros...
