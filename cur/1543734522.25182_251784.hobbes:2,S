The hotplug routines for vga objects in the code I posted get passed
vga_dev objects. You can put what you like in those. I guessed at 
"memory manager" "dri" and "framebuffer0" being the ones to create for
now but we can invent anything thats more appropriate.

The ->remove function is passed the number of remaining clients for
exactly this reason. We could move the resource grabbing up the tree.
IRQ handling is rather harder. Quiescing and handing back the IRQ on
lock loss is ugggggggggly so I want to think about it - it works but its
not nice.
Should pci_enable and friends be done by the vga class driver- it can do
this and it would have to do it if it did the hotplug ?

Agreed.

I saw vgacon as being a client of the vga class driver like the various
fb drivers would be.

The VGA driver at the moment doesn't really know about legacy vga space.
That was something I wanted to touch last of all because it is foul. It
can do this and as you say its the perfect person to issue the hotplug
notifications. It also needs to do it for vesafb so if it is handed an
ISA hole it can work out the right PCI device.

As many as you want. Just change the array size or the number
registered. One neat trick we can support is adding extra devices when
necessary - thus if the boot code in user space boots a card and decides
its multihead we'd want to add extra heads.

Big lock issue. You get told if someone else ate your environment. Being
more polite about that would help performance a ton. You know who had
the lock before and who has it now - so we can be intelligent about
->release cleanup I hope. (eg FB0 finds FB1 had it last it might do a
minimal restore)

The ->remove path takes the lock (so calls ->release) and then drops it
with no callback needed so providing the hand over code is robust this
will come for free.
