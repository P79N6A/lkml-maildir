It still uses devfs I think.  Or you can just run the mkdev.sh command 
to create the proper devices.
This is from installing lm-sensors:
 * *****************************************************************
 *
 * This ebuild assumes your /usr/src/linux kernel is the one you
 * used to build i2c-2.8.2.
 *
 * For 2.5+ series kernels, use the support already in the kernel
 * under 'Character devices' -> 'I2C support' and then merge this
 * ebuild.
 *
 * To cross-compile, 'export LINUX="/lib/modules/<version>/build"'
 * or symlink /usr/src/linux to another kernel.
 *
 * *****************************************************************
You always need the lm-sensors package, period--it has all the user land 
utilities plus drivers for most of the chips/sensors.  You only need the 
i2c package on earlier kernels, use built in for 2.6.  On my Asus 
boards, I use the asb100 module which is not in the kernel.  `find 
/usr/src/linux -name asb100* -print`  Not there.  Remember, you'll have 
to recompile the lm-sensors package everytime you upgrade you change 
your kernel.
