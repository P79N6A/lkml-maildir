For the paranoid 
You ssh from the source to an untrusted chrooted nopriv uid on the target
using a ssh pass phrase and ipchains static ip rules to allow only some
IP's access
A cron or other triggered job on the receiving machine checks the GPG
signatures of the uploaded data and moves/processes it if it matches or
if the key matches blocks off that machine and ID and mails the admin.
