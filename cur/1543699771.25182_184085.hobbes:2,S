This is mighty suspicious. With -j2 did you check to see that there
were indeed two parallel gcc's running? Since -test6 I've found that 
-j2 only results in a single gcc instance. I've seen this on both an
old hacked-up RH 7.3 installation and a brand new RH 9 + updates
installation.

Since -test6 I've found this to be the case for kernel builds, yes. But
I don't think it has anything to do with the scheduler or HT vs SMP
platforms.
