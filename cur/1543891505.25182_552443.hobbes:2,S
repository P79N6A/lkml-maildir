This started as a non-regression bug-report about wakeonlan
During tests I found a real regression and this email is only about 2.6.22-rc3
without Rafael's patches - which I'll happily come back to later :)

Given that I expected it to fail I unmounted my 1Tb array data before suspending.
It succeeded... so I started digging...
So I tried again.
2.6.22-rc3 (vanilla) suspended OK this time but on resume hung at:
Stopping tasks done
Shrinking memory done (0 pages freed)
Freed 0 kb in 0.0 secs (0.0MB/s)
Suspending console(s)
Then 2.6.22-rc3 again but CONFIG_DISABLE_CONSOLE_SUSPEND=y
It suspended again.
Froze on restore.

Then 2.6.22-rc3 again but CONFIG_DISABLE_CONSOLE_SUSPEND=y
This time, before suspending I unmounted my xfs/lvm/raid6 filesystem.
Just a umount, I left the devices/array up.
It suspended again.
This time it resumed without fault.
The machine has another xfs filesystem :
/dev/hdb2 on /scratch type xfs (rw)
I've started bisecting... any other info needed?

Added Linus as it's a regression
Added xfs as unmounting an xfs filesystem 'fixes' it.
