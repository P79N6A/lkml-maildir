Sure. I have to admit that if I run a `cvs co linux' and while it's
running I shutdown the machine, then with my patch you have some more fs
corruption, but that's not an issue according to me.
If you stay idle for one minute and then you'll shutdown the machine
without unmount my buffer.c don't lose one bit of data on disk.
If you want to be more conservative (now I use 30 sec of timeout for the
superblock and 60 for data/metadata blocks) you have only to change
/proc/sys/vm/bdflush and my buffer.c will follow you closely (I can agree 
also to return to the old timeout even if I would like these new ones
also considering sometime in the future will be fault-tolerant).

I am producing a patch against 2.2.8 (I'll upgrade it to 2.2.9 when
patch-linux-kernel will send me the new stable kernel uuencoded ;).

Agreed.

You don't need a debugger, you just have SYSRQ+M or SHIFT+something (that
really is racing ;) but I just fixed the race here with a spin_trylock).

Did you interrupted the kernel in the middle of mark_buffer_dirty?
