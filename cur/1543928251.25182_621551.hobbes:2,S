Well that would be good if poss, thanks.
But fixing bugs is way more important than niceties of patch presentation
however I wasn't prepared to fix the rejects which that patch is hitting in
the considerably-changed bonding_show_ad_partner_mac().  Please:
- raise patches against the latest Linus tree
(
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/snapshots/
)
- cc netdev@vger.kernel.org on networking-related matters
- Include a Signed-off-by: as per Documentation/SubmittingPatches
- Try to ensure that the full explanation (such as you have above) is
covered in the changelog text.
Thanks.
