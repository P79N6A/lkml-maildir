Well frankly because whenever I tried it it didn't work. The i810 drivers were
*completely* broken in the 2.6 kernel I original installed, 2.6.5 I think.
In any case I understood that Quake doesn't work with alsa drivers because it
depends on mmapped output which they don't support at all. Or something like
that. I gave up on them when I found OSS worked reliably.
Until someone broke it between 2.6.6 and 2.6.9. How likely are the 2.6.6
drivers to compile with 2.6.10? Is it worth trying?
