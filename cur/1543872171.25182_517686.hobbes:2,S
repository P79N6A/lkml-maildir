Yes, I see what the code does, but I don't undestand why. For example, SIGCHLD was
delivered to the process _and_ handled several times, then sys_signalfd_dequeue()
comes and finds only one siginfo. Isn't this strange?

Sorry, I don't understand. The masks are different, yes, but ->sighand is the
same? How this can make any difference for "if no signalfds are attached" ?
OK. What is the purpose of signalfd? Should it record the signals which were
sent to the process, or only those which were delivered? The latter looks
more natural for me. But inn any case, I don't see a reason to check ->pending
mask in signalfd_deliver().
BTW, sys_signalfd_dequeue() re-queues signalfd_sq if copy_siginfo_to_user()
fails. Why not -EFAULT?
Also. A malicious user can eat all memory, signalfd_deliver()->kmem_cache_alloc()
doesn't check any limits.

I was wondering about that too.
