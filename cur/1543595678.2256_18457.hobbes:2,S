I really want somebody who has worked on weird caching architectures
to look at it too, but I don't see that the new code works well.
First, don't we want to do a flush_page_to_ram() *before* starting the
swap IO?  There's no point dma'ing the swap page to ram if old, dirty
cache data is then going to be written back on top of that.
Secondly, the flushing of icache/dcache only needs to be done by the
time we come to use the page, so can be performed any time, before or
after the IO.  We're not going to be accessing the page during IO so
if we flush first we won't risk having stale cache data by the time
the IO completes.
So, why not just do the flushing before the IO?  Adding an async trap
to flush the page after swap IO seems the wrong approach: this should
be possible to fix synchronously.
Cheers,
 Stephen
