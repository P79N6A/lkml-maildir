ah.. I see :)

Umm, I've tried almost, if not all, vanilla kernel 2.4.2x and 2.6.x, none of them could make the cardbus work. (For 2.4, I can to disable kernel pcmcia and use pcmcia-cs to make it works). I usually use "acpi=on pci=noacpi" for kernels that include ACPI. I also tried other boot param when I tested them, but the cardbus never work. lspci always reports irq 11 for the cardbus controllers.

It's better to fix them if we could. :)
