Your .config compiles for me with neither errors nor warnings in the 
input system.
Well, with the exception that "make oldconfig" reveals that you have the 
following options set that aren't present in 2.6.16-rc6-git6:
CONFIG_NO_IDLE_HZ=y
CONFIG_FB_SPLASH=y

It seems the cause of the problem is that you omitted the information 
that what you call "2.6.16-rc6-git6" is in fact 2.6.16-rc6-git6 plus
tons of patches, and one of these patches is causing your problem.
