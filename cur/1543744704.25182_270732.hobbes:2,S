This sounds very wrong.  Why did it get removed from bus->devices ?
If it isn't on bus->devices, how does pci_bus_add_device() help?
Sure you get it onto the global list and into the device tree,
but it won't be attached to the parent bus properly.
I think what you want to be using is:
int __devinit pci_scan_slot(struct pci_bus *bus, int devfn)
to discover the new device, which will do the right thing from the
point of setting stuff up before calling pci_bus_add_device*().
