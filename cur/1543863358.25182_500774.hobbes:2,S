Moscow wasn't built at once...
You may notice as some others are doing little by little steps:
- source cleanups;
- right dependancy;
- headers includes;
- warnings elimination;
- code reading-analyzing (brainwashing, as for me;) and a few line
fixes everywhere.
I think there are members here, who doing things, like that for at
least two years.
You are trying to focus (mostly) on style and sense -- ok. And maybe it's
like to be alone within a crowd. Anyways, as long as you fill, that you
can do that, and patches are accepded, changes are *documented* its ok,
also. Sometimes it's stupid, worthless or something else. If so, then
find more interesting things to do, unless you are going to proof
something to somebody ;E.
Here's, as i can see, almost no place for emotions, only technical stuff
and everything not far from it. See, there isn't any reply on you
message, except this one. I think, because of that.
