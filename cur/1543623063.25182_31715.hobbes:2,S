These cards are now supported by the new Tigon3-driver. URL and more
information about the driver can be found from mail with subject:
"Subject: [BETA-0.93] Fourth test release of Tigon3 driver"
You can find broadcom5700-chipset at least from 3com 3c996 cards.
Intel's EtherExpress Pro/1000 cards do also have new driver in the
