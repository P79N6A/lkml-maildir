hi-
 after building and rebooting under 2.2.10 on an SMP x86 machine,
untarring the linux-2.2.10.tar.bz2 file always fails, reporting that the
tar archive is corrupt.  Using the same kernel on a UP system works fine
every time.
 my syntax: bunzip2 -c linux-2.2.10.tar.bz2 | untar -xvp
 could this be a processor/task sync issue ?
 I'll re-rebuild, and try it all again today (to see if --I-- screwed
something up)...
