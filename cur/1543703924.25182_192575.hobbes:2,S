I'm having a couple of minor issues with ACPI in the -mm series.
The battery status on my Dell Latitude D800 won't work at all without
the patch from 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1766
 however,
with vanilla 2.6.1 everything seems to work fine.  Without this patch I
get tons of _ut_allocate: tried to allocate zero bytes (or something
close to this) and no battery status at all.
With the patch mentioned above everything seemed to work OK, however,
recently I enabled both 4GB highmem support (this seems to get me an
extra 128MB on my 1GB system) and preempt support and now, while it
initially works fine, the system eventually quits reporting battery
status and I get a lot of messages like the following every time I poll
for battery status (over and over if a battery status applet is loaded):
    ACPI-0279: *** Error: Looking up [BST0] in namespace,
AE_ALREADY_EXISTS
    ACPI-1120: *** Error: Method execution failed [\_SB_.BAT0._BST]
(Node f7feea60), AE_ALREADY_EXISTS
It seems that I can trigger this much quicker if a generate a lot of
traffic on my aironet wireless adapter, it will only take minutes to
occur.  I'm going to try to back out preempt and 4GB support one at a
time and see what happens.
I haven't been able to reproduce any of these issues on 2.6.1 vanilla.
Later,
Tom
