Ahh, interesting idea.  I have not thought about using pipes since
my main concern was needing to put coredumps into a place that can
not fill up useful disk and, in the case of the diskless nodes, is
writeable since everything else is not.  We just grab the core dumps
later in order to figure out what went wrong.  Under non-development
cases we should get close to zero core dumps.  (Ahh, if that were only
true at this time... :-)
