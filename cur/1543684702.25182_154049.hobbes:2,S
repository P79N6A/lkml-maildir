Subject: 2.6.0-test2 froze while installing j2sdk-1.4.2 with netbeans (low on details)

Ran into a system lock up while running 2.6.0-test2 kernel and 
j2sdk-1.4.2-nb-3.5-bin-linux.bin (the latest Sun Java standard kit 
installer with netbeans and run as root). I'm sorry I don't have real 
details. I'm not at liberty to retry the java installer right now. But 
basically the system froze - no mouse movement, no caps-lock light 
toggling, no ctrl-alt-backspace (to shutdown X), no ctrl-alt-delete (to 
reboot), no ctrl-alt-fX (to switch to another console). If someone else 
encounters this then maybe at least the info can be used to better 
identify a pattern (like when this first started showing up).
