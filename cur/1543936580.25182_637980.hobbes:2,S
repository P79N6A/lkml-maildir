The only way you could do that on 8250 is to clear the RX FIFO, enable
loopback, wait for the port to transmit all its characters into the RX
FIFO and read them out that way.
That brings up other questions though:
- what if its a port with 256 characters in the FIFO, and its programmed
  for 110 baud?
- what if loopback isn't supported?
- what if, while doing this operation, the remote end is sending characters
  because you can't deassert RTS?
Finally, on many non-8250 ports, you don't have a loopback mode to
enable, so you have no way to read back the contents of the FIFO.
