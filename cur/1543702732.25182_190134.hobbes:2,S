mmap only works for user space memory, not for kernel memory.

The kmalloc implementation is object based, it cannot grow in place. The 
only approach is call ksize and check if it fits by chance, otherwise 
alloc new block and memcpy, then free.
Why do you need realloc? What do you want to do? Are you aware that 
kmalloc is limited to 128 kB, and that large kmallocs (I'd guess: > 16 
kB) can fail due to memory fragmentation after long uptimes?
