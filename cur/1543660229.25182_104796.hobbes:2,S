	Does do_gettimeofday() exist on all platforms?  Does it indeed
give actual wall clock time, instead of the inaccurate time jiffies can
give?

	No, I mean 60 *seconds*.  There have been drivers and such that
do pause the entire box that long.

	Yup, for the default.  I'm not beholden to these specific
defaults.  They're just the defaults we use in our environment.

	Look at the calculations.  I'm comparing cycles to cycles,
calculated from the original seconds.

	I'll look into it, but it must absolutely be in terms of wall
clock time as measured from outside the system.
