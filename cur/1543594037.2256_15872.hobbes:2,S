You can tune things by setting the tcp-timeout probably..I don't
know exactly where to set this..
You probably don't want all tcp to time out at 15 seconds anyway, so
I'd suggest either using non-blocking connect (if you have the code
that does the connect), or just set a timer (or use sigalarm) when you
start the attempt, and fail the attempt if the timer or alarm signal
goes off.

Ugly is relative, and don't use ping because there is still a race condition
(ping worked, but by the time you try tcp, the box is down.)
