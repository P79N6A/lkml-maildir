I need to resubmit this patch.
Resubmission will be in my next email.
It was a minor problem whereby the patch would advise the user
	If a device isn't working, try "pci=nommconf".
even when "pci=mmconf" was used at the command line.
One additional line of logic fixed it, but I would like to resubmit
the patch rather than patch the patch.
