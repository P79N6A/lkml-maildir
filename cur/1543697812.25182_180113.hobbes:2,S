Hi,
I am writing a kernel code to test the disk performance and other details under different kind of databases. Could someone help me with details, as to where I can find sample database, which I could use for testing. If I could find benchmarks, it would be great. I am looking for something like, NetBench, but which is for DataBase.
Thanks to all...
