Unless you are using data=journal and have turned write cache off on
your IDE drives that is expected. Metadata journalling protects your
file system intgerity. Data journalling is more expensive but will
protect your file integrity if the disk layer is also correctly set up.
Unfortunately the IDE layer defaults the wrong way and despite many
complaints has not been changed. In later 2.6 with modern drives you can
also enable barrier mode on the IDE layer which gives better results
than turning off the write cache.
