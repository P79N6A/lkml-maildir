Well if I was trying to isolate a problem, I would make it
that easy. You boot the machine in its simplist configuration
and work "up" from there.
Although I haven't looked at recent source-code, with APIC, the
problem is even simpler. If you booted with APIC, just set
the global "using_apic_timer" to zero and, voila`, timer-ticks
stop.
Any any event, the caller needs to know that if there is
any code executing anywhere that does the equivalent of
		for(;;)
                      ;
...the machine will lock-up forever because without that timer,
there will be no preemption. Once a CPU-hog gets the CPU, only
and interrupt can get it away.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
