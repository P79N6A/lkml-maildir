I'm still dying to see what the human-readable output from this
thing looks like.

OK.

OK.

OK.

OK.

Not a good idea to expose raw flags in this manner - it changes at the drop
of a hat.  We'd need to also expose the kernel's PG_foo-to-bitnumber
mapping to make this viable.
Not a good idea to use page->_count: page_count() will be more stable. 
Otherwise OK, I guess: the interpretation of the page refcount is unlikely
to change much over time.
