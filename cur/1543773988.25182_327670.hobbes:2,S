Damm, beat me by a few minutes :)
Yes, this is the proper fix for this.
But to answer Alan's main question, I think you are correct, we should
not fail device_add if binding a device fails.  I can see this causing a
lot of very difficult problems in the future (including the fact that
I've been hitting this bug with a new driver I'm writing and didn't even
realize it...)
So, I'll apply this one, and revert the main part of Hannes's patch too.
Thanks for tracking this down.
