With the introduction of the nanosecond fields in struct stat the
utime() syscall is kind of obsolete.  It's not possible anymore to
restore the exact access/modification time of a file.
Unix defines the utimes() function for this.  It is currently
implementated in glibc on top of the utime() syscall which used to be OK
but isn't anymore today.  In addition some systems provide the futimes()
and lutimes() functions which appropriate semantics.
The question: would a patch introducing these syscalls be accepted?  If
there are filesystems which store the sub-seconds on disk I think this
is necessary since otherwise all kinds of programs (including archives)
cannot be written correctly.  If the sub-seconds only live in memory I
still think it would be good to have the syscalls but it would not be
that urgent.
