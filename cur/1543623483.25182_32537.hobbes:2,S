	For a moment I thought that must be the point that I
was missing, but I don't see any such bounce buffer support
in linux-2.5.6-pre2/include/asm-i386/pci.h or arch/i386/kernel/pci-dma.c.
I do not see how this is currently implemented on x86 systems with >4GB
of RAM.
	Or, by "will use" did you mean "will implement in the future?"
