Hi,
There have been several changes in this area since 2.6.8.1, it 
would be nice if you can repeat the tests with a recent -mm kernel 
(where most of the changes are).
One information is that there are not many freeable pages in 
the normal zone (active+inactive) lists:
 DMA free:1904kB min:16kB low:32kB
high:48kB active:112kB inactive:0kB present:16384kB
Sep 30 08:53:22 lacerta kernel: protections[]: 8 476 732
Sep 30 08:53:22 lacerta kernel: Normal free:1512kB min:936kB low:1872kB
high:2808kB active:216kB inactive:436kB present:901120kB
For me it looks like you might be seeing a kernel memory leak (what else
could cause such condition?)
IIRC quite some kernel memory leaks have been fixed since 2.6.8.1 
(cdrom driver, NFS, ...)
