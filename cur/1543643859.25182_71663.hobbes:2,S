Yes, but why are page_add/remove_rmap slower in 2.5 than in
Con's -rmap kernel ? ;)

Looks like an unfair sched_yield, the process load is supposed
to get 20% of the CPU (one process in process_load vs. make -j4).
For the other results I agree with you, furter VM improvements in
2.5 will probably fix those.
cheers,
Rik
