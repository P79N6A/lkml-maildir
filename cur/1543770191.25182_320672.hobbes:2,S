If irqs are run in threads, which are scheduled, how are they scheduled?
fifo? What's the point then; simply to let the top half run to completion
before another top half starts? If it's about setting scheduling priorities
for irq threads, some one top half can prempt another, why not just use irq
levels, like bsd (using pic's is slower than using threads?)?
