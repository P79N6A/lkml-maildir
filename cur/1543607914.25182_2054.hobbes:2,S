IIRC the top 2 bits of the first byte of the 8 byte lun define the layout-
this is what you have to look at on the initiator side when you do a REPORT
LUNS command.

I'm not sure I agree. As we move into more and more virtualization types of
enviroments, the full 64 bit WWPN is often used as the 'lun'. So while it is
true that it's not important now, I suspect in a couple of years it might be.
