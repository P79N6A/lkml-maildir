   Ted's already got it. I'm trying to convince him it should be in
   the serial driver.
Not for 2.4.0......

   That'd be the way to go I think.
Can someone help me with coming up with a generic, orthoganal set of
ways in which half-duplex connections can differ (i.e., which RS-232
line to use, delays before transmission, delays after transmission,
etc.)  that cover all of the different, incompatible ways that
half-duplex is done?  If we can do that, we can use a bitmask to
describe all of the different ways that half-duplex can be done.
If that's not possible, can someone enumerate all of the different
half-duplex can be done?  Simply having all of this information in one
place would be really helpful, both as documentation and so we can
actually put together that list of #define's.
Thanks!!
