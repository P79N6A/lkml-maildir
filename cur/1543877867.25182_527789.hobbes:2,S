Are the initial BUGs usually of that kind - rmap.c:434?
(The subsequent scheduling-while-atomics and highmem.c:42s
are not interesting, just consequences of the original BUG
in an untidy place.)

I've never seen a BUG in page_add_anon_rmap before:
there's one in page_remove_rmap which comes up from time
to time, but this is different.
The page allocator has just dished out a PageReserved page
(at physical 1G+8k: interesting that it's so close to 1G),
which should never happen - but there was less checking
for that in 2.6.9-based kernels.
Do check your RAM (memtest86 overnight), maybe that
PG_reserved bit is spurious.  But if rmap.c:434 is
what's happening to you again and again, I'd wonder
if a driver has been allocating a high-order page,
marking the constituent pages as reserved, later
clearing reserved from the first constituent page,
then freeing the high-order page while leaving other
reserved bits behind - I believe that could sneak a
PageReserved page back into the 2.6.9 allocator.
If it were a particular application triggering this,
it'd still be a kernel bug to allow it to happen.
