	They make really long serial cables... ;)  You could always run a
phone line to it and hook up a modem too. :)  I've found that on my production
machines logging the console info to a serial port is very, very useful.  If
you need a machine w/ a serial port, I'll give you a 386. :)

	Hrm, 2 floppy drives?  They're not very expensive, but I can see
many possibilities where that isn't practical...

	I believe folks are currently internally doing this (Keeping their
own lists of bugs, basically), but I agree, it would be nice to have a
centralized repository for bugs.  However, this can NOT cause developers to
have to spend excessive amounts of time dealing w/ it.  One run by users
may be of some use, though linux-kernel archives are relatively good at that
in and of themselves...
	If you're interested/willing to start up something where people can
easily come and log new bug reports and/or look up/search bug reports, I'd
say go for it.  I'd suggest you talk w/ some of the big linux sites about it,
and just make sure someone isn't already trying to do something like this,
and possibly get them to provide links from their sites to your 'bug reporting'
site.
	Basically, if you have a good idea, and it doesn't look like anyone
else is implementing it, talk to some folks, yes, but the best thing you can
do is give it a shot and get folks to critique it.

	cat /usr/src/linux/.config would also be useful I think.  Assuming
you compile your own kernel.
