Caching and prefetching would solve that probem much more usefully.
Does sshfs not cache or prefetch any of the data?
IMHO, caching and prefetching makes a lot of sense for this situation
- in fact, it does for any kind of filesystem operation during a
sequence of file operations where a program does not use locks (flock
etc.), fsyncs, or open/close.
Surely caching and prefetching should be a generic feature of FUSE for
all its filesystems unless disabled.  Is there a reason why this is
not done, or is it just not implemented?

NFS makes file operations interruptible when they're mounted with
"intr".
It's a life-saver, when the server or network gets wedged, to be able
to Control-C a program instead of it being stuck in D-state and
requiring a reboot.
Having a program be stuck in read/write ignoring signals, so that
Control-C, Control-Z and kill don't work on it, while it's waiting for
some network operation, is a horrible thing.
