This is the slowest choice, but will work correctly.
It is better to make the user do explicit "dcbf", etc.
on cached memory. (use non-coherent mappings to avoid
wasting memory bus cycles on cache coherency traffic)
As long as users go through a library, they won't mind.

Speculative reads only cause trouble if:
1. they are cached by an access through the BAT mapping
2. reads through the uncached page mapping use the cache
3. user code cares... AGP memory is for WRITING video frames, yes?
Speculative writes are like speculative reads, unless the PPC
is stupid enough to set the dirty bit even when the write does
not get performed.

It's a waste to use BAT mappings for the kernel anyway, because
we try to keep the huge computations and graphics in userspace.
With page tables under BAT mappings, privileged user code could
be allowed to steal BAT registers for locked memory or IO memory.
So at the very least, you can keep the BAT mappings enabled
until user code wants AGP memory or is allowed to have the
BAT registers. When the user is done, the BAT registers may
be used to cover kernel space again. Other than the memory
used for page tables, there doesn't seem to be any harm in
having page tables that match the BAT registers in use.
