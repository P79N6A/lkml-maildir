Right, the data is there.  There is a lot of "merge noise" in BK where BK
is just recording the fact that changes in unrelated files have been 
brought together.  In general, you don't want to see all that noise, it's
more or less internal BK metadata.  So BK/Web filters it out, as does
bk changes.  But in this case, because the cset in question is "named"
with a tag it should have been shown.
It's a presentation issue, not a data problem, which is why CVS/SVN saw 
it - the exporter works on the raw data.
