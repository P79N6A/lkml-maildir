More to add on the gcc 2.96 problems.  After compiling a Linux 2.4.1 
kernel on gcc 2.91, running SCI benchmarks, then compiling on RedHat 
7.1 (Fischer) with gcc 2.96, the 2.96 build DROPPED 30% in throughput
from the gcc 2.91 compiled version on the identical SAME 2.4.1 
source tree. 
I think RedHat should jetison gcc 2.96 as soon as possible...
Tests run on a PIII system limited to 90 MB/S PCI throughput.
gcc 2.91 on a PIII system in sci_copy mode           85 MB/S
gcc 2.96 in RedHat 7.1 (Fischer) in sci_copy mode    63 MB/S
