Right.
And wrong.
Yes, there's a court ruling.  The ruling is almost certain to be held up
on appear for years by a government that thinks its own silly problems
are more improtant than the privacy of the people it's supposed to
protect.  As happened to the lower court ruling in -97.
Until the case can be brought into the supreme court, that court ruling
doesn't actually imply much anything - although I agree that it is a
small victory for sanity, it is only a psychological victory right now. 
EVENTUALLY it may be considered binding.  Right now it's not something
you can really depend on.
