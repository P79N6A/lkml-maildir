akpm has suggested something like this in the past.  I respectfully 
disagree.
The 2.4 kernel will not benefit from constant churn of backporting core 
kernel changes like a new scheduler.  We need to let it settle, simply 
get it stable, and concentrate on fixing key problems in 2.6.  Otherwise 
you will never have a stable 2.4 tree, and it will look suspiciously 
more and more like 2.6 as time goes by.  Constantly breaking working 
configurations and changing core behaviors is _not_ the way to go for 2.4.
I see 2.4 O(1) scheduler and similar features as _pain_ brought on the 
vendors by themselves (and their customers).
Surely it is better to concentrate developer time and mindshare on 
making 2.6 sane?
