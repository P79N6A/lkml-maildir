If it has such (I don't know), then their own kgcc does not seem to have
confused users.
This let me propose to fix the above comments as follows:
        The kgcc mess is a redhat-7'ism.
May-be, the kgcc thing is not a bad idea (I would obviously prefer to use
a single gcc release on a given system), but, as it is presented in redhat
7.0, it looks like a show-stopper given all that have been reported about.
A red dune's cap redhat should deserve for this one, in my opinion. ;-)
