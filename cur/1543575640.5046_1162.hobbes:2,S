Hi
I reported a problem with using 'init 1' with 2.4.0-test12-pre8 and was
told it wasn't a kernel problem. I beg to differ, as it still happens
with 2.4.0-test12 but not with 2.4.0-test12-pre7. What changed between
pre7 and pre8 to make 'init 1' behave like 'init 5'? 'init 3' works
correctly. The only change I've made is to build the new kernel.
The screen messages say it is going into single user mode, but it just
doesn't.
Have I missed something that should be changed in the configuration?
