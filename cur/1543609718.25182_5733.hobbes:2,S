We've tried a number of boards for our application servers and the only UP 
AMD DDR board I trust right now is the Gigabyte GA-7DX.  They are rock

Other AMD 761 boards may work, but I've made too many late night trips to 
the colo to stray from what I know works.  DDR support seems to be the 
breaking point on most boards.
