Currently I'd say it's mostly the other way around.
Differences between procps-2.1.11 and procps-3.1.2 that relate
to Linux 2.5.xx support are:
1. Robert has /proc/*/wchan support (for WCHAN w/o System.map)
2. My vmstat has a fast O(1) algorithm for 2.5.xx kernels
3. My vmstat reports IO-wait time
4. My sysctl handles the 2.5.xx VLAN interfaces
So that's 1-to-3 in my favor, based strictly on support of the
2.5.xx kernels. I find this odd actually, seeing as the procps-2
developers made #2 and #3 possible. The only time I fell behind
was when Rik patched procps _before_ Linus accepted a change.
