The driver only calls pci_map_sg() once it's insured that all local
driver resources are available to submit an I/O to the hardware.

Why?  It's just another resource which is consumed -- the qla2xxx
driver is the final consumer before I/O is submitted out on the wire.
The mappings are held for the shorted time required -- as such, are
released as soon as the I/O completes.
