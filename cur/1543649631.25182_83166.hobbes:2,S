i very much doubt this would stop anyone who really wanted todo
something like loading a module.
Stating something like that would also mean booting the kernel from
a disk inside the machine is also insecure.
As to load a module you must be root and if you are root you
can read / write disks. Thus you could recompile your own kernel
install it try to force a crash or a reboot which is not hard as root
and the person may not even notice that the kernel has grown by a few
bytes after the crash.
The only thing it may do is slow somebody down.
A lot of people out there if they can get access to a system
and cannot keep it will also tend todo a rm -rfv /
or equivelent nasty.
