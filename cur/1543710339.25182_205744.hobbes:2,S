There are two common reasons for binary firmware:
1 - it runs on some sort of a state machine implemented in an ASIC or 
other device for which you have no manuals or assembler.
2 - since these devices are regulated all to hell by the FCC and other 
non-technical groups balancing technical advice with political pressure, 
a user might code the device out of spec, causing some manner of legal 
hassle.
I don't know if (1) applies here, but I'd bet (2) is applicable.
Let's be happy that we have a driver and treat the device as a black 
box. There are people paid to know enought details to write firmware, 
I'm happy to treat NICs and CD/DVD burners with the "buy good and update 
firmware at the first problem." Keeping the old firmaware of course.
