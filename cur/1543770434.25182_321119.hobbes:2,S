Yes I did see that post of yours, but I didn't really understand the
explaination. (I hope I don't quote you out of context, please correct
me if so).
I don't see why you would have problems crossing kernel "concurrency
domains" with the nanokernel approach. Presumably your hard-RT guest
kernel or its tasks aren't going to go to the Linux image in order
to satisfy a hard RT request.
Also, you said "I have to think about things like dcache_lock, route
tables, access to various IO system like SCSI and TCP/IP, etc...",
but at first glance, those locks and structures are exactly why you
wouldn't want to do hard-rt work along side general purpose work in
the Linux kernel.
And quite how they would interfere with the hard-rt guest, you didn't
make clear.
"A single system image makes access to this direct unlike dual kernel
system where you need some kind of communication coupling. Resource
access is direct."
... but you still need the locks, right?

Is this one reason why a nanokernel is better, then? So you wouldn't
have to worry about the SMP rebalancing, and TLB issues, and everything
else in your Linux kernel?

I'm not sure if you exactly answered my concerns in that thread
(or I didn't understand). It would be great if you could help me
out a bit here, because I feel I must be missing something here.

Well, so long as everyone's on the same page, I'll stop with my
silly disclaimers ;)
