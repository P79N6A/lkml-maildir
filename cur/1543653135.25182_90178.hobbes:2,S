we broke binary compatibility several times, for the benefit of having a
cleaner interface. Ulrich has no problems with this approach and NPTL is
the only user of these interfaces currently. But i think you are one of
the few peoples who are running an NPTL system (ie. with the new
NPTL-glibc actually installed as the default system glibc) - is binary
compatibility important to you for this specific case?

finish_arch_switch() is a no-op on UP. (well, almost, i'll fix that.)

we could do that - although we cannot fail the CHILD_SETTID variant, and i
wanted to keep it symmetric.
