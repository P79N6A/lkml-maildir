My point is simply that a proposal to extend the VFS in this way needs
to be accompanied by a compelling argument showing the performance bump
that its providing.

Good - this is true for both XFS and ext2/3 then.  So, we are talking about
using ref counting vs. copying for any in-kernel users of attrs, and you're
saying there is some significant overheads with copying and I'm saying show
me what kind of overheads we're talking about, please.
