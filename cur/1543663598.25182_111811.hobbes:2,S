The solution in Debian was to include both the 2.4 and 2.5 variants. There
where a bug in that, since initrd-tools forgot to include it, which is now
resolved. The correct variant was used depending on which kernel where
installed. A neater solution where to include the correct tools and modules
for kernel.
