No significant differences.  :-(
Well, about all I can suggest is bisection.  And don't assume that this 
problem was caused by a change to the USB stack.  It could be a change 
in the interrupt-handling core or a change to the driver for one of the 
other devices sharing the IRQ.
It might even be caused by a change in the order the modules are 
loaded, which has nothing to do with the kernel directly.  In fact, it 
might be worth checking this possibility first.  For example, it's 
clear that 2.6.22 loaded ehci-hcd before uhci-hcd whereas 2.6.23-rc1 
did the reverse.  And yenta vs. uhci-hcd is different.
