I would agree, except that some people either don't have the space for
splitting up, or have too much space and cant figure out where to put it w/o
waisting a lot of space.  Someone I know has a 4gb drive and just made one
big partition.  He got tired of having to repartition becuase /usr or /home
got full.  I did the same on my laptop since I wanted to put a cdimage on it
for transport (Before I got a burner).  I didn't want to split it up so I
have enough for /, enough for /usr and enough for /home.  Another machine I
have, I didn't have the space for it, only 270mb drive (not used much <g>)
Another machine I have has / and /home the same partition for the same
reason, but /usr is seperate.  On my primary machine and on my sparc, / /usr
/home and /usr/src (I don't back that one up since it's only the kernel) are
seperate.
I think the point of the above disabling ln for non-owners/non-root would be
the simple fact that the 'sendmail hole of the week' (I don't know if it
happens now or not, I haven't used sendmail in years) could be exploited
when new holes came out when a user did 'ln /usr/lib/sendmail /tmp/.test'
Maybe it would be ok to allow ln except check for non-root/non-owner status
with setuid/setgid bit set.  This imo would be worse. (as the case above)
