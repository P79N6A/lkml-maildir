Subject: [patch] [Kconfig] disable GEN_RTC on ia-64

IA-64 does not have a directly accessible real-time clock.  As far as
I know the only method to access the clock on this platform is to go
through EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface, like a BIOS), which is
handled by efirtc.c.
genrtc can be configured on for this platform but does not build
(because there is no asm/rtc.h), and anyhow it is never likely to be
useful.  I suggest that it should be disabled in Kconfig, as rtc.c
already is.
Perhaps other platforms that don't support it should be turned off
too.
