Wrong.  Seems I have to explain in great detail:
The linux source may not be entirely _free_, because the GPL
says, among a few other things, that you can't change the licence.
But it is definitely _open_, because there is no restriction on who
you can give the code to.
Code with trade secrets in it may or may not be "free of charge"
but it is definitely not _open_.  As others have pointed out, the
laws about trade secrets _require_ that reasonable measures
be taken so the secret doesn't get out - or the secret is void.
Open source is something I can put on a public webserver, where even
someone's competitor is able to get at it.  Code with a trade secret
in it cannot be given away like that.  Making the secret part available to
the above mentioned competitor would break the secret, and is therefore
illegal if trade secret protection is required by licence. Therefore,
such code cannot be put in a public place, therefore such code
is _not_ open, even if it might happen to be "free of charge".
