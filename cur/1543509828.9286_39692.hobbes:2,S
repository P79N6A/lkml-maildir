I've had similar problems with other kernels, not SMP, but also
with ne2k pci.  The most recent RedHat rawhide kernels (2.2.12-10)
don't seem to have this.  There have been some similar reports on
comp.os.linux.networking.  I reported it to bugzilla (bug 4925) on
Sept. 5, but it still hasn't been assigned.
