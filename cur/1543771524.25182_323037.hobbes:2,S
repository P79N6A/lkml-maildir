Looks good.

Maybe we should call this tcp_get_current_congestion_control(), the
current name implies (to me) that you give it a name and it returns the
the ca struct. get_current might also just return the current one and
the strcpy can be done here.
Otherwise you probably should document the tcp_get_congestion_control()
to say what size of string it accepts.
