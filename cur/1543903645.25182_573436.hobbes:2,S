that's a marketing thing mostly.. they all still run at the same voltage
anyway.

multicore changes the rules a little but not all that much. (the idle
power is higher if not all cores are idle at the same time. Yet... each
core individually trying to be idle as quickly as possible is the best
way to get to the highest "all cores idle" time, unless there is some
really special/weird synchronization)

these are second order effects though. On a pc, the transition costs are
quite low (as I said, single or low double digit microseconds).
They are not zero, and that is why you see things like ondemand ramp up
only after a little time, as a guestimate to make sure it's not just a
really short lived code execution.

let me give you a real world example then, and the numbers I'm using are
ballpark the same as you'll find in a (mobile) core 2 duo datasheet, I
just rounded them a little so that the math works out nice.
power at full speed: 34W
power at half speed: 24W
power at idle: 1W
assume media playback, and a dumb one, that takes half a second to
decode a second of media. (again to make the math simple)
at half speed: Energy for a second is 0.5 * 24 + 0.5 * 1 = 12.5 J
at full speed: Energy for a second is 0.25 * 34 + 0.75 * 1 = 9.25 J
this works for all systems where the idle power is more lower than the
power you save by dropping speed... and that is almost all of them in
the PC world.
now you can argue that 0.5 seconds is a really really long time, and
you'd be right. so for really really short stints (say a timer
interrupt) you don't want to change the voltage at all (nor would you
want to change the plls to change frequency for that matter). But once
you start chaning those, you might as well go full speed.
