This is a rather ugly fix, but it demonstrates the hole.  It's possible
for a posix lock to get applied after the final close of the file.  This
means locks_remove_posix misses the yet to be created posix lock, and
on final fput when leaving fcntl, locks_remove_flock will BUG().
I was able to reproduce Ivan's bugreport.  I doubt it's the right/best
fix, but it's functional (no more BUG()).  Against -bk-curr.
