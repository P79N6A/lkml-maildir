Subject: fdomain driver in 2.2.13 bug report

The fdomain driver keeps dying on me, taking the machine with it, when using
it for an ISA TMC 16x0... card that handles four SCSI drives.  The death
happens randomly sometime during the middle of the night.  The error message
that I've seen the last two times is posted below.  At this point the
machine is frozen.  If anybody has any suggestions on how I could fix this
bug let me know.  Thanks.
