Out of the question if you want to use legacy tools.

My gut feeling is that this whole concept is too messed up to be sorted
out. That something can easily be done given whatever underlying structure
there is doesn't make it worthwhile to do it. Just as it is absurdly easy
to allow hard links to directories if you look at how they are implemented,
but the consecuences aren't that easy to live with.
