The goal is very simple. It is to make the information available. What
people choose to do with that information and such bug reports is up to
them. Similarly the policy is in user space modutils.
Unfortunately I get so many bug reports caused by the nvidia modules and
people lying when asked if they have them loaded that some kind of action
has to occur, otherwise I'm going to have to stop reading bug reports from
anyone I don't know personally.
I am not prepared to be an unpaid Nvidia support goon.
