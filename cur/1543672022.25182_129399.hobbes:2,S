There aren't any PPC64 boxes with this chipset (ATI Mach64 GX), since
all past and current PPC64 boxes are IBM servers.  I suppose one could
find an old ATI Mach64 PCI card and put it in a PPC64 box, but I don't
know why you would do that instead of putting in a PCI radeon or
something. :)
Regards,
Paul.
