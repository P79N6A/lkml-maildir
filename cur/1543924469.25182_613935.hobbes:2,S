Hi,
today I ran into a kernel bug when I ran 'rc-update add xdm default' on
gentoo. See:

Kernel is 2.6.24-rc1 from Nigel Cunningham's tuxonice tree. Latest
commit from git
log was d51f219edfdba30db26dbfd27cd7ca6a11c140d9.
Unfortunately I couldn't reproduce it (directly after the boot process I
logged in and
wanted to add X to default runlevel, logout and login as a normal user,
I did the same
thing again, but it didn't happen again.) and it only happened once.
Therefore I don't know if this was already present in earlier kernels.
Greetings,
Bernd
