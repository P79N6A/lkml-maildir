 Why do I see all the time using >O3 when in the gcc man/docs they say the
max Ox is 3 and above that it is assumed that is O3?
 -finline-functions makes a difference in C++ 8) but the number of inline
functions can be defined with finline-limit.Could you be more specific
about the major performance loss?
 Rename registers from the gcc 3.2 man:
"Attempt to avoid false dependencies in scheduled code by making
          use of registers left over after register allocation. This
          optimization will most benefit processors with lots of
          registers. It can, however, make debugging impossible, since
          variables will no longer stay in a "home register"."
 Making debugging impossible could be a problem in the kernel apart from
the performance :)
