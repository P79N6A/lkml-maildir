Yes it would be nice to believe that taking some -mm components into -ck would 
actually make -ck better than everything across the board. However the policy 
changes that make up staircase are not compatible with most other changes in 
-mm, and most of the differences are due to the difference between the 
mainline scheduler and staircase. There are some vm tweaks and the like in 
-ck which only show up when you nice things though and that would improve the 
results if we were comparing different nice values on interbench. 
Furthermore,  Mike's changes that Andre tested only worsen interbench results 
so they would make staircase/ck look even better than -mm than it currently 
does. Some of the things Andre found better on -mm with Mike's changes may 
well be fairness related because staircase is more effective at maintaining 
fairness than mainline without any special throttling.
Cheers,
