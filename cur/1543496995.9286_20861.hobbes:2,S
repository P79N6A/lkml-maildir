Or just try my patches at
ftp://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/pub/linux/input/
They use the i8042 in raw (non XT) mode, and also try to switch the keyboard
into codeset 3, and so the Sun keyboard should work rather well with them.
If not, only minor changes to scancode tables will be needed, and I'll be
happy to do them.
