Yes, very interesting thing. While one will destroy its part.table, he can not 
see until reboot, heh. But there were days, when grub used to install itself on 
XFS partition (XFS isn't FAT-boot-record compatible) *silently*, but nothing 
was wrong to me : it's linux-gnu ;D
I would love just little kernel boot parameter to configure it, or sysctl in 
procfs.

IMHO you've wrote much more here, then just for not-so-useless-solution, that 
i've wrote above, unless you want another wind0s clever-heuristic with patches
