We are having the same observation here, PNP yse or no does not change dmesg
output of 2.4.x.

O.K., here are three further dmesg outputs of the same 2.4.3 kernel
configuration (yes ""|make config) [Thanks to Jens and David!].
Two MSI K7T Pro2A boards (my first report was a MSI K7T Turbo board with
KT133A):
    dmesg.David.msi-k7t-pro2a.log.gz
    dmesg.Silke.msi-k7t-pro2a.log.gz
An Asus A7V Board:
    dmesg.a7v.log.gz
Recognizing any pattern?
