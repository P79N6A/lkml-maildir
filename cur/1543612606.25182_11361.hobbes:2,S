No it wouldn't.
Once you do a pthread_create(), the locking is there.
Before you do a pthread_create(), it doesn't lock.
What's the problem? Before you do a pthread_create(), you don't _NEED_
locking, because there is only one thread that accesses the stdio data
structures.
And there are no races - if there is only one thread, then another thread
couldn't be suddenly doing a pthread_create() during a stdio operations.
Safe, and efficient. Yes, it adds a flag test or a indirect branch, but
considering that you avoid a serialized locking instruction, the
optimization sounds obvious.
