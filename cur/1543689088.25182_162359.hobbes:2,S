No, we would have to support all versions of the APIs over time, making
the kernel larger and harder to maintain.

No, release frequency would have nothing to do with this.

No.

Please read the FAQ and many discussions about this very topic in the
past in the archives for why the kernel does not have a stable API
within itself.
That being said, the ammount the API changes over time in a "stable"
kernel series is usually quite small.
I understand coming from the Windows world this seems odd, but after a
bit of time you will see why it is quite nice.
Good luck,
