Pavel,
I failed to make the point clear.
One thing I learned was never trust the BIOS, even if you wrote it.
Now if you are missing ACPI hooks to beat the BIOS silly for whatever
reason you want, I will load two barrels towards Andy for not finishing
the task or not explaining how to throttle them.
I do not care if the BIOS want to do monkey flips.
If there is an event any piece of hardware can not handle, ie where you
have inserted tests that default to panic, it had better allow you to
throttle to full enable.
If it does not, the solution is to make a blackball list of hardware
which fails to conform to acpi rules.  Fair warning you had better have a
means to prove it because, public lists make companies nervous.
So, that I am clear ... would you consider changing the default method of
operations for errors.
How a BUG() and a really long long timer until the battery dies, a panic
gives little or no information, but this is my opinion.
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick
