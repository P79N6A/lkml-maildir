I'm opposed to further junk going into drivers/char. It is already an 
incomprehensible mess of unrelated code.

Concur with the invasiveness angle.
Actually, I've got another idea, based on some stuff that I've been working on 
for the ACPI "its not just power management" issue. 
If you need to set something in drivers/input (per your original patch) that 
depends on things that are set in drivers/char (or drivers/usb, anything that 
comes later), then split the Config.in into two sections. One section 
contains the normal Config.in user-selectable options, and a second 
drivers/input/Config-post.in, that is sourced in at the end of 
arch/foo/config.in and contains only automated Config.in dependancies (ie 
define_bool) but no user selectable options.
Does this make sense? If not, I'll try for a patch that shows it later this 
morning.
Brad
