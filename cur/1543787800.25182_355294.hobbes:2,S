Hi Rajesh,
Thanks for the insight. But my doubt is that the PCI Express devices
down the hot-pluggable slots are working fine. i.e. if we forget about
the hot-plugging / unplugging, the bridges and devices are working
fine, even with ACPI enabled.
So is the presence of bridges in ACPI namespace required only for
hot-plugging / unplugging and not for normal operation?
Thanks,
Rajat
