	2.4.1ac18 and loop-4 doesn't mix at all well, it didn't even compile (
understandably (sp?) if we think that a large hunk of loop.c is
rejected, and by studing the reject it seem to me that the original
version and loop-4 are going in differend directions :( ).
	So, lacking the skills to fix-it myself I'll try a new INNOVATIVE
approach: "Begging the Developers (TM:)" that was reported to give
excelent results in the past:
	" Can I have my lil'ol loop FS back, plizzzz, plizzzz, I need it badly
but also I need the other improvements in ac18, I know you are busy with
other important things, but pleeez ( innocent look :)"
	And it remains to see if once again this method gives results ;)))).
