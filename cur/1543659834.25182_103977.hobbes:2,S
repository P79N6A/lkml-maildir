I grabbed the datasheets of the memory chips and found out the 
following, that changes the incorrect information that I had:
1) NEC D43256BGU is 256Kbits = 32KB (32768 words of 8 bits)
This chip has 15 address lines (A0-A14) and 8 data lines (I/O1 - I/O8).
2) NEC D431000AGW is 1Mbit = 128KB (131072 word of 8 bits)
This chip has 17 address lines (A0-A16) and 8 data lines (I/O1 - I/O8).
So it seems that these chips doesn't have a serial-like interface for 
bit-banging, I am wrong?
