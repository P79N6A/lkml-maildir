If you are going to be compiling PPC devel kernels, and reporting bugs
on them, you should (a) follow linuxppc-dev, and (b) grab the latest
2.3.43-preXX pre-patch, which includes PPC fixes.
In general, PPC tends to lag behind the Linus tree, so you should always
use Paul MacKerras(sp?) or similar kernel trees.
