Well, you could try running two lmbenches at the same time,
one at normal SCHED_OTHER latency and the other in SCHED_IDLE.
If that doesn't break the system, it probably means my patch
is pretty safe. If it _does_ break the system, could you tell
me which tests were running at that time -- then I know what
other situations to test for in the scheduler...
