Yup.

Makes sense.  I had a go at this ages ago and wasn't able to demonstrate
much benefit on a mixed workload.
I wonder if it would help if the page zeroing in the idle thread was done
with the CPU cache disabled.  It should be pretty easy to test - isn't it
just a matter of setting the cache-disable bit in the kmap_atomic()
operation?
There are quite a few patches happening in this area - the
make-kswapd-aware-of-higher-order-pages patches and the no-buddy-bitmap
patches are queued in -mm.  It'll take some time to work through them
all...
