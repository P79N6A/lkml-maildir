hi-
 Several of us are seeing subtle problems with the NFS system under
2.2.x.
 Since the NFS stuff was moved into kernel-space, there has been a
significant increase in tasks freezing due to NFS being device-locked. 
This can be easily reproduced by mounting a remote system, then shutting
down that remote system without unmounting it.  
 Shell sessions attempting to access directories on the shut-down
machine lock-up solid (device-locked), and they cannot be killed by any
means.  Back when NFS was user-space we could at least kill, then
restart these errant sessions.
 If curious, we are using 2.2.9 on x86 arch.
 Thanks-
ron
