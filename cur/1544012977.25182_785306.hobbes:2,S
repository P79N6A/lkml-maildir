Sure - there was a recent discussion in the context of how broken the
sync(2) syscall is.
That is, some filesystems (e.g. XFS) have certain requirements
to ensure sync actually works in all circumstances and the current
methods that sync employs make it impossible to sync correctly.
It's made worse by the fact that XFS already has internal methods
to completely and cleanly sync the filesystem (i.e. the freeze
code) but that can't be called in the sync() context because
writeback is a property of the VFS and not the filesystem.
It was discussed on linux-fsdevel. <rummage>

I simply haven't had time to dig into this far enough to
come up with a patchset to fix the problem....
Cheers,
Dave.
