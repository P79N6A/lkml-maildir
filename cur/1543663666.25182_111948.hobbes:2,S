This exact thing happened to me as well, on a 2.4.20-pre that hasn't been 
upgraded to 2.4.20 yet.  The thing that concerns me most is:
Why won't the system kill the process it claims to be killing?
If, in Marc's case, the system wants to kill PID 2657, a lowly sleeping 
apache process, why can't it?  This is a bug for sure.
For me, there was some python process chosen as the one for killing and it 
repeated the 'Out of Memory: Killed process xxxxx (python)' for hours 
while making no progress.  The machine was still routing packets but I 
couldn't log in.  Sys-rq was disabled, so I was forced to use the big red 
button.
Rik, any ideas?
David
