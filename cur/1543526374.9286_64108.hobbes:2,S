[Snipped]
Johnson is correct. The 8259A IRQ inputs are all latched. This is
essential for interrupt priority. There is a D-type flip/flop at
each input. This is reset only when an end-of-interrupt comand is
sent to the device. Whether or not the EOI resets the current
flip/flop depends upon the kind of EOI sent to the device. If it
is the specific-end-of-interrupt, the particular latch (called the
in-service latch) for the specific IRQ is reset. It you send it
the non-specific-eoi, the highest priority pending interrupt's
in-service latch is reset.
Sombody said that the 8259 was made for the 8080. This cannot be.
The 8080 was not capable of vectored interrupts. It had one interrupt
which was always executed from a particular code-location. A ISR
had to poll each possible device to see which one, if any, was
requesting service. Of the early Intel CPUs, the first capable of
vectored interrupts was the 8085. It was used in the DEC monitor
for VAX machines of which I am very familiar.
Normally it is expected that since interrupt request lines are
fed all over the place, in the VAX they were even looped through
boards on a large noisy backplane, they might be noisy. Normally,
interrupt vectors not in current use are handled by a do-nothing
interrupt service routine and ignored.
Interrupt service routines should (must???) be designed so that
nothing bad happens if an interrupt occurs and the code finds that
there is nothing to do. In fact, this is how one can share interrupts.
I am not a kernel hacker. However I can read C code. It looks
as though somebody tried to make an issue about every unimportant
hardware glitch that made it through the controllers. There seems
to be some kind of cult or witchcraft associated with this code.
Fortunately new motherboards don't use the 8259 when running Linux.
Their interrupts are handled through the APIC code. I certainly
hope it's in better shape.

          I speak only for myself, which is enough of a problem.
