hi all,
What ever i tell below is with reference to RAW SOCKET implementation in   
Linux.
can any one tell me what happens to the sk->opt copied by ip_get_options.
I guess the sk->opt should be copied into every IP packet thats going to   
be send out via this socket sk. (correct ?)
i couldnt find Where it is copied into the outgoing packets.
thanx for any help
shankar
