Well, I am seing some dups, but they are so volatile that no two runs 
will report the same allocations as dups, and its never more than 2
using /proc/fs/ext3 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr |grep -v ' 1 '
Consecutive runs will show anywhere from 3 to 10 or 12 dups, but never 
is an address repeated between runs.
How is this to be interpreted?
FWIW, I'm now up 25 hours, with PREEMPT off.  No Oops's yet.
