I agree. And I don't see how the int3 approach fills the need of embedded
systems and high performance computing developers, so I think that a "call"
alternative, where the stack is set up by gcc itself, is worthy.

Yes, I just wanted to show that there was some performance merits to this
technique, more benchmarks will be needed. The main problem I have seen with
your condition+call approach is that there is no safe way to remove the function
pointer without causing a huge mess (null pointer dereference). This is why I
thought of this alternative that has the abolity of keep a consistent execution
flow at _all_ times.

Yup, I agree, but it's nice to have the ability to jump over inline functions :)

Yes, but you also have to take in account the stack setup cost. Idoubt that it
will be faster than a jump, but this is worthy to test.

Absolutely, you are right. Good catch! I am putting a asmlinkage prefix to the
probe function, which will make sure that every argument is passed on the stack.
From 
http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Attributes.html
"regparm (number)
    On the Intel 386, the regparm attribute causes the compiler to
    pass arguments number one to number if they are of integral type in
    registers EAX, EDX, and ECX instead of on the stack. Functions that
    take a variable number of arguments will continue to be passed all
    of their arguments on the stack.
    Beware that on some ELF systems this attribute is unsuitable for
    global functions in shared libraries with lazy binding (which is the
    default). Lazy binding will send the first call via resolving code
    in the loader, which might assume EAX, EDX and ECX can be clobbered,
    as per the standard calling conventions. Solaris 8 is affected by
    this. GNU systems with GLIBC 2.1 or higher, and FreeBSD, are believed
    to be safe since the loaders there save all registers. (Lazy binding
    can be disabled with the linker or the loader if desired, to avoid
    the problem.)"
so a regparm(0) seems like a good solution there.

Yes, the problem is that, after having ran such tests on a slower approach, the
macrobenchmarks failed to show any difference. Yes, those tests should be done,
but I don't expect any revelation from them.

Nope, as the module_exit _has_ to call marker_disable_probe and that
marker_disable_probe does a synchronize_sched(). Because the function call is
surrounded by preempt_disable(), there will be no execution stream within the
function when the module will be unloaded.
