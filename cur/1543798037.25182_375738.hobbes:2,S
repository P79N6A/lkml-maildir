Only the pointer is placed onto read mostly section.
In fact the pointer is written once at boot time, then it is only read.
kmem_cache implementation is SMP/NUMA friendly, keeping care of false sharing 
issues, and node aware memory.
But the initial pointer *should* be in a cache line shared by all cpus to get 
best performance. It's easy to achive this since the pointer is only read. 
(well... mostly... )
