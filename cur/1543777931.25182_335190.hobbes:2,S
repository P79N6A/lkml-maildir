Hello,
just some basic questions :
  - did your configuration change before the oopses started ? (eg: new
    matches, etc...)
  - did the traffic change recently (protocols, data rate) ? eg: new
    applications on the network, etc...
  - is it possible that it's being targetted by an attack where it is
    installed (unfiltered internet, holiday employees who like to play
    with the network, etc...) ?
I really find it strange that it suddenly started oopsing if nothing
changed. At least it should have been oopsing from day one.
Regards,
willy
