   Now I wonder if we could make these pages COW mode.
   When some process try to update the pages, they should be duplicated.
   I's easy to implement it in write(), truncate() and so on.
   But mmap() is little bit difficult if there no reverse mapping page to PTE.
   How do you think about this idea?
I think this idea has such high overhead that it is even not for
consideration, consider SMP.
