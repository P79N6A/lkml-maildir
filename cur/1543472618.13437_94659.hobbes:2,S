Hello people,
This seem to be a bug of the ethernet card driver but I am not quite sure
(that's why I am posting this:-)) 
So I am using an eep10pci.c drivef for an EtherExpress Pro/10 PCI card 
(
http://www.ultranet.com/~stalba/,
 thanks Krzysztof G. Baranowski for the
point), but seems that driver(?) has problems with switching card into
promisc. mode. I've discovered it first using tcpdump, but then wrote a
piece of my own code which used SOCK_PROTO, but things don't change.
Kernel, however, thinks that card is running in promisc. mode (ifconfig
shows that), but anyway, application gets only those datagrams which were
sent to/from my host.
I am running kernel 2.0.36, but I also tested this with 2.1.30 kernel, and
driver supplied by Krzysztof. Any hints?
PS: I have a number of other machines in the same lan with me, where I
tested the same stuff, and it works(!) there.
