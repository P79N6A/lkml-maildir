[... Profibus ...]
Wouldn't it be easier to put a small microcontroller (say an 8051) on
a board with a reasonable intelligent PCI bridge and implement the
packet transfer in this controller? Then you would just put your
telegram onto the chip, say "hey, send it out" and have no longer
worry about specs?
Ok, you can't use your $10 standard PCI serial hardware, but at least
any user could be assured that the right lamp / engine / magnet is
turned on or off.
If this protocol is only really reliable in hardware, why not
implement it in hardware.
	Just some thoughts...
