*vmalloc* TLB flushing. 
void flush_tlb_all(void)
{
        on_each_cpu(do_flush_tlb_all, NULL, 1, 1);
}
Of course we could use a new vector for it and speed it up a lot more,
but after my vmalloc improvements I think that would be a waste of a
vector at this point.

Oh really? Coming from what callers?
