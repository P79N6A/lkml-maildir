Actually I'm concerned about total kernel command line length,
so using option names that are "long" when short will do is not good IMO.
I.e., I can easily overflow a 255-byte command line length buffer,
so Shorter is Better.
However, "when short will do" does not mean making them unreadable or
like they mean something else, like "nopkt".
