This is a RedHat kernel which contains some extra patches. You will be better of
downloading the linux-2.2.13 tar file.

If you try this in the above kernel it will fail but for the record:
You apply patch-2.2.6 to go from kernel 2.2.5 to 2.2.6.
The easiest way is to download all the patch files into /usr/src
(if the kernel tree is in /usr/src/linux) and then do
prompt> linux/scripts/patch-kernel
This will take care of everything for you.
Again this will not work with your 2.2.5-15 kernel tree and instead of
downloading the linux-2.2.5 plus all the patches just get the 2.2.13 kernel.
