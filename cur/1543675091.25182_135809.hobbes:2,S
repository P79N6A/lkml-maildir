Yeah, but latency != throughput ;)

It is possible. I use 2.5 (preferably -mm tree) now more then any 2.4*.
I use the AS (Anticipatory IO Scheduler) which AKPM included in his tree.
This scheduler is kicking ass. Everything is rock fast, I can trash my HD to 
whatever I want, I still get no mouse stops, keyboard stops or anything like 
that. Even starting up multiple programs is possible while trashing the HD. 
Sure, it takes longer but it works :)
I try to backport BIO and then AS for quite over 2 weeks now, but it seems, at 
least for me, that it's an impossible mission ;(

Yeah, that's not an option. The throughput has been increased in 2.4.19 
compared to 2.4.18.

Hmm, I am quite sure that it isn't. I have ton's of mostly totally different 
hardware in my company, also test machines for WOLK at freenet.de (the 
biggest I had was a QUAD Xeon 1GHz with 16GB memory and hardware RAID (Compaq 
ML570 to be exact (f*cking nice machine btw. ;) and I even hit it on that 
machine. Friends of mine having also different hardware then me, also hitting 
that bug. _If_ it's the case of storage hardware, then many storage hardware 
is affected ;)

Oh, did I miss something at lkml or was it privately?
