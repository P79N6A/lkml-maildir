Bzzzzert. I _hope_ that you will not follow that rule in mount(8), because
otherwise... Guess what it will do under 2.2? Right.

You've just done that _and_ kept the same syscall number. mount(2) documented
as above is _NOT_ the same syscall as it used to be since '94. Different
documented calling conventions. And anyone trying to follow them will get
a program that behaves on any kernel prior to 2.4 other than expected. Worse
yet, you will not get an error from mount(2).
Moreover, now we get an undocumented and strange-looking interface that _is_
compatible between 2.4 and earlier kernels. Fun, fun, looks like mount(8)
uses it instead of what had been said in the manpage.
Sorry, but having the parameters used by mount(8) left _undefined_ in
mount(2) manpage strikes me as extremely bad idea.
