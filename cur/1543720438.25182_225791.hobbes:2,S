Hi Trond,
 For those interested, this patch reverts NFS to the old behavior of
a timestamp-for-each-write.
I see no harm in it.  After all, timestamps have to be updated on file
creation and close, which are also initiated from the client, just as
writes are.  So allowing timestamp update on create/close but not writes
does not make much sense to me.
Unless the real reason is reducing ethernet traffic.  In which case we
could defer a timestamp-on-write only when it is still in the same second
as the previous write, but don't defer when a new second rolls around
on the client.  That would reduce timestamp updates to at most one per
second per inode per client, while preserving old NFS behavior.
Regards,
Joe
