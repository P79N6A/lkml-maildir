You are absolutely correct that fanotify doesn't help with object
movement or path maintenance.  Neither had been requested, but
notification (that an inode moved) shouldn't be impossible (although the
hooks are going to be a lot more involved and will probably take some
fighting with the VFS people, my current fanotify hooks use what is
already being handed to fsnotify_* today)  To directly answer you
requests
1) autoadd isn't really what I'm looking at, but maybe someday I could
take a peek, at first glance it doesn't seem unreasonable an idea, but I
don't see how the userspace interface could work.  Without the call the
inotify_init to get the watch descriptor how can userspace know what
these new events are?  Only possibility I see for this is if inotify got
an extensible userspace interface.  In any case I'd be hard pressed to
call it a high priority since it's already possible to get this and the
intention of the addition is to make userspace code easier.
2) major vfs and every FS redesign me thinks.
3) What you want is IN_MODIFY from every inode but you want them to all
coallese until you grab one instead of only merging the same event type
if they are the last 2 in the notification queue.  Not sure of a
particularly clean/fast way to implement that right offhand, we'd have
to run the entire notification queue every time before we add an event
to the end, but at least this is doable with the constraints of the
inotify user interface.
Can't this already be done in userspace just by draining the queue,
matching events, throwing duplicates away, and then processing whatever
is left?  You know there is atomicity since removal of an event and the
addition of an event both hold the inotify_dev->ev_mutex.
In any case, I'm going to let your thoughts rattle around in my brain
while I'm still trying to rewrite inotify and dnotify to a better base.
My first inclination is to stop using inotify and start using fanotify.
Abandon filenames and start using device/inode pairs and you get
everything you need.  But I'm certain that isn't that case    :)
