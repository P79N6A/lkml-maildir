cpuburn sometimes uncover memory failures too (especially burnMMX).
But read on, this is most likely not the case for you.

So it works with standard 80x25 text mode? ok...
AFAIK vesa mode 788=0x314 - 800x600 65k colors (5:6:5 r:g:b bits),
am I remembering right?
Did you try other framebuffer modes like 640x480 256 colors?
I suspect they will fail similarly, but worth testing that.

This is interesting. Where does your linear framebuffer memory start?
Post dmesg, /proc/iomem. You may do this from mem=848M boot first,
then from crashing one.
I suspect that kernel somehow overlayed RAM and video RAM ;)

You can try "mem=exactmap mem=640K@0 mem=nnnM@1M" to make kernel
avoid stomping into video memory.
It's a bug, we'll need to check why does that happen.

Let's debug it, and Linux will not crash too.
