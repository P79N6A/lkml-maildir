I had boot problems with my BP6 with the orignal bios it came with. I
upgraded to latest Beta at the time (3 months ago). I am using a PCI S3
video card, and 2 celeron 433 processors, not overclocked. 
I am also using the HPT66 controller with the ide patches and 2.2.17pre13.
I have 2 drives in a raid one array, one on ide3 and one on ide4... The
box normally has uptimes of around 40 days. Except for at the moment while
I'm testing pre- kernels.
