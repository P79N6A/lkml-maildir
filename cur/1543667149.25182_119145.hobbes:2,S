A bunch of comments:
 - your docs mention devfs_only() buts it's gone for good now
 - you removed the last users of devfs_alloc_devnum()/devfs_dealloc_devnum(),
   please remove the functionality aswell (not exported anyway)
 - is the conditional call to init_devfs_fs() in devfs_decode() really
   nessecary?  I think one explicit call to it in the early boot
   process would be much better.  If you don't like that at least
   mark it unlikely()
 - why do you raise the capablities in devfs_register() and
   devfs_mk_symlink() (but not devfs_mk_dir()!).  I think any driver
   code actually calling that must run with raised privilegues already.
 - I think renaming base.c to interf{,ace}.c is a good idea.  It's
   more descriptive and will make the diff a lot easier to read.
