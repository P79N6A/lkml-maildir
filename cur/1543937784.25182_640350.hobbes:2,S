Or rather instead of git reverting drop them completely. I'm sure it can 
be done somehow. You should also move 
CPA: Implement change_page_attr_addr entry point for i386
Similar to 64bit.
Needed by PAT patches. Replaces 5ec5c5a2302ca8794da03f8bedec931a2a814ae9
Note: should probably be put before PAT patches to avoid bisect failures later
and
CPA Handle 4K split pages at boot on 64bit
Port the code to check for already split 4K pages at boot over from
32bit to 64bit.

in front of the PAT patches like described in their descriptions. I put
them at the beginning and they are independent so that should be possible
without conflicts.
I'm not sure what git commands to use for that, but I'm sure it can be 
done somehow.
