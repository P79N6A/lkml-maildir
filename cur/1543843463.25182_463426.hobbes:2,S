That fixed name device isn't used to get a list of tunnels. Instead,
ipip and gre read /proc/net/dev, and check for ARPHRD_TUNNEL or
ARPHRD_IPGRE. This won't work for etherip because it uses ARPHRD_ETHER,
which isn't specific to etherip tunnels. A new ioctl to get a list could
be added (this ioctl would use the fixed name device), is that acceptable?
