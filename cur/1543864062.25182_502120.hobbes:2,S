Has anyone looked at marking the buffers as "needs refilling" then kick 
off a kernel thread or something to do the allocations under GFP_KERNEL? 
  That way we avoid having to allocate the buffers with GFP_ATOMIC.
I seem to recall that the tulip driver used to do this.  Is it just too 
complicated from a race condition standpoint?
We currently see this issue on our systems, as we have older e1000 
hardware with 9KB jumbo frames.  After a while we just fail to allocate 
buffers and the system goes belly-up.
