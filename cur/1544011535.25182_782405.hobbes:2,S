This does not look like 'fix for a serious bug' to
me. stable_kernel_rules.txt says '...not a "this could be a problem"
type thing'.
Yes, maybe iommu is mature enough that we want it enabled, but...
(Or maybe Documentation/stable_kernel_rules.txt needs updating. The
patch for penguin dirty feet already got in.....)
