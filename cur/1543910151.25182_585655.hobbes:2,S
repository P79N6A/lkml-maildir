Subject: [PATCH] wait_task_zombie: don't fight with non-existing race with a dying ptracee
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/17/159

(textually depends on wait_task_zombie-remove-unneeded-child-signal-check.patch)
The "p->exit_signal == -1 && p->ptrace == 0" check and the comment are bogus.
We already did exactly the same check in eligible_child(), we did not drop
tasklist_lock since then, and both variables need write_lock(tasklist) to be
changed.
