I think both the changelog and the comment are confusing,

because the change itself looks like an obvious performance fix, even
we don't use multiple pid namespaces. I don't think it is good idea to
add a fat comment which doesn't match the current reality, and find_pid()
should be avoided anyway.
Stupid question: why do we need to put the pid namespace into the struct
pid? Isn't it better if the user of the struct pid should know its ns?
For example, if /proc does put_pid(), that pid should be from the active
namespace.
Sukadev, could you cc me if you do that kind of changes?
Oleg.
