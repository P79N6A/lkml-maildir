Hmm. This does seem to indicate that v10 lost many of the preempt changes. 
Probably because Peter went back to v7 to create it.
I also wonder about the timing numbers - the numbers were probably done 
with some random version and then not re-done, so the commit message is 
not necessarily "sane" in that respect - the timings quoted don't 
necessarily match the code committed.
