It's a false positive from the script which checks whether all per-cpu 
variables ended up in the correct section. __crc_page_states__per_cpu ends 
in __per_cpu, that's why the script thinks it's a per-cpu variable, but
it's not, it's just a checksum.
Could you try if this patch fixes it, I don't really speak awk ;)
You should be able to reproduce the error by just doing "rm vmlinux; make 
vmlinux", but not anymore after applying the patch below.
