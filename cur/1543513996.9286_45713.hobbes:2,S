Hi guys,
I've Debian 2.0 ( with gcc 2.7.x ) and I've compiled 2.2.13.
My system mount only /dev/hdb2 = root as auto-mount.
If I do a simple login and shutdown the system goes down well.
If a do some work, at shutdown ( "shutdown -h now" ) I receive, 
as last message ( the unmount all step ), a "Device busy /" that 
result in a fsck complete run with some INodes with 0 date.
All goes well with 2.2.10 .. 2.2.12.
Cheers,
    Davide.
