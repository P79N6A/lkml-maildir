Heisenbug via code alignment might be, but the bisection result seemed
rather reliable.
I have 4 good boots with all mm-patches before the maps2-* ones and 2
out of 3 boots failed with part or all maps2-* patches applied. (Any
many more failed boots with more mm-patches applied.)
But I do think it might be very possible that some (maybe even
correct) change in the behavior of this code triggers the error. So
I'm very interested in what you additional printk outputs to track
down what changed and why this breaks.
I looked at the scripts from the initramfs, but sadly I don't see
anything that crawls throug /proc and might hit your files. Other than
that there is nearly only busybox in there. cryptsetup should run
later and modprobe does not have any modules it could try to load...
