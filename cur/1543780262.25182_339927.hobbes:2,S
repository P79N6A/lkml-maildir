Kernel is not a place to be user friendly. Or do you propose stripping whitespace
for open(), too? File called "foo.txt    " certainly *is* going to be confusing, but it should be allowed at kernel level.
Now... echo foo > /sys/var does not properly report errors. Thats bad, but it needs to
be fixed in bash.
