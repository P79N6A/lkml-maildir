Subject: unneeded #include <version.h> in many places ?

Hi,
I noticed some kernel .c files #include <version.h> which typically
contains something like:
#define UTS_RELEASE "2.6.9-rc1"
#define LINUX_VERSION_CODE 132617
#define KERNEL_VERSION(a,b,c) (((a) << 16) + ((b) << 8) + (c))
However, those files don't reference the macros.
The question is: are these includes completely unneeded, so I can
remove them, or do they serve some special purpose?
Another one: there are drivers using constructs like:
#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE > 0x20115
...
#endif
I understand they can be somehow useful for authors supporting many
kernel versions with a single set of files, however the gain isn't
clear to me. Should such conditional code be a) removed, b) left
in place, c) dealt with each case individually?
