I'm not sure your patch makes anything much better, though.
Why does CONFIG_LSF exist in the first place? Afaik, it only affects a 
totally not-very-interesting thing (blkcnt_t) for a totally not very 
interesting feature (the number of people who want single files >2TB is 
likely not very big).
Having it auto-selected by LBD sounds insane, since LBD is likely more 
interesting than LSF itsef is. It would make more sense to go the other 
way (have LSF auto-select LBD).
