do you realize that more than 120 seconds TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE _is_ 
something that most humans consider as "buggy" in the overwhelming 
majority of cases, regardless of the reason? Yes, there are and will be 
some exceptions, but not nearly as countless as you try to paint it. A 
quick test in the next -mm will give us a good idea about the ratio of 
false positives.
