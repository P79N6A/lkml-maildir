No, by this twisted logic Tivo *cannot* modify that particular copy any 
more than you can. They can modify *another* copy (just like you) and 
they can *replace* the copy in your device with the new version (unlike 
you).
So your entire logical construct does not stand because this is not 
(cannot be) about modifying a particular copy (how would you do that 
anyway? hexedit the binary blob in place?) but about the ability to 
deploy the software on a particular platform.
