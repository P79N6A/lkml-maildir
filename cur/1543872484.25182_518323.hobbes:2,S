Doh, can't believe I didn't notice that. That's apparently a default
in Debian/unstable (not sure where to tweak it). Reniced:
             without ccache    with ccache
make -j 5 
 beryl       good              ok
 galeon      ok/good           ok
 mp3         good              good
 terminal    good              ok
 mouse       good              ok
We're still left with a big unexplained ccache differential, and a big
NO_HZ vs HZ=250 differential.
