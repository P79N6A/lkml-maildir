Hi Srinivasa!
    That's not my point.  What you care about is that the text still be there.  
The fact that it's the __init section which is discarded is a detail; if some 
other text section were discarded you'd want that excluded too.  Hence 
non_init_ was a bad name; persistent is a bad name because it usually means 
something else in operating systems...

Sorry, I meant symbol_put_addr().

No, symbol_put_addr() will fail to decrement the module count, thinking it's 
part of the (now-discarded) init section.

Perhaps, but two new functions is v. ugly.  I'll try to come up with something 
neater, and audit all the callers.
Thanks,
Rusty.
