No, your patch allows ARM users to set CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE=n no matter 
whether they have any options set.
Before, ARM users had to set EMBEDDED=y, and with my patch they would 
have to set EXPERIMENTAL=y for getting this broken configuration.
config CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE
	bool "Optimize for size (Look out for broken compilers!)"
	default y
	depends on ARM || H8300 || EXPERIMENTAL
does allow CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE=n if ARM=y and EXPERIMENTAL=n
(which was reported as being broken).
config CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE
	bool "Optimize for size (EXPERIMENTAL)" if EXPERIMENTAL
	default y if ARM || H8300
does not allow CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE=n if ARM=y and EXPERIMENTAL=n.
