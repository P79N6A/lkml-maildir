Sometimes I'm willing to vouch for the quality of the *code*, and I
want a "go ahead and do it" from the kernel crowd.
Writing the code without consensus on the architecture can make you
have to go back to architecting when people have architectural
objections. 
Part of the problem is that in a company the manager is in the end
responsible for the salary of the guy doing the work. So he'll work
along an try to make a good architecture before doing the actual
coding.
For Linus it costs just one Email to say: "Hmm. Maybe. Show me the
code!", and reject the code later on.
