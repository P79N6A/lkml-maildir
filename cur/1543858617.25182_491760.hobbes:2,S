Guys, we have about 1000000000000000000000000000000 reports of weirdo
crashes, smashes, bashes and splats in the kref code.  The last thing we
need is some obscure, tricksy little optimisation which leads legitimate
uses of the API to mysteriously fail.  
If we are allocating and freeing kref-counted objects at a sufficiently
high frequency for this thing to make a difference then we should fix that
instead of trying to suck faster.
