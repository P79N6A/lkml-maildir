	Oh, I don't want that ever in the name.  I don't want to have to
know much about my disks, except that once the association is there,
it's there until I delete it.

	There are multiple reasons.  I need to know what's a disk so I
can configure it.  I need to know what's a partition or a logical volume
so I can put filesystems on it.
	It's always fun these days when folks try to use 'whole disks'
and 'partitions' as equivalent things.  They are indeed from a block
device standpoint, but they aren't from an administration standpoint.
