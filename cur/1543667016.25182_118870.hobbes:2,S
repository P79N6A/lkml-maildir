Hi.
Thanks for your work!
I just manged to suspend and resume a freshly booted 2.4.20 + "your
latest patch" system ;-)
I had to read the kernel source a hour to do so, because I use devfs
and naively used resume=/dev/ide/host0/.... which obiously does not
work.
For now you might add to the docs that devfs users simply have to use
the corresponding old /dev/hdX name. If I have too much time I'll take
a look to make swsuspend devfs aware. But this might not be that soon
:-(
I'll report after more testing.
