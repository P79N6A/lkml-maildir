I think you are misunderstanding between
 1)lazy fpu save handling for user space task
 2)kernel_fpu_begin()/kernel_fpu_end() inside the kernel

My explanation was a bit ambiguous, see the code below. 
Where the fp register saved? It saves fp register *inside* task_struct,
static inline void kernel_fpu_begin(void)
+	if (tsk->flags & PF_USEDFPU) {
+		asm volatile("rex64 ; fxsave %0 ; fnclex"
+			       : "=m" (tsk->thread.i387.fxsave));
static inline void save_init_fpu( struct task_struct *tsk )
+	if ( cpu_has_fxsr ) {
+		asm volatile( "fxrstor %0"
+			      : : "m" (tsk->thread.i387.fxsave) );
What happens, during your copy function, if memory is not allocated and 
generates pagefualt and goto reclaim memories and go into task switch
and change to other task.
