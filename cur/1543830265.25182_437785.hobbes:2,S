it is relevant to a certain degree, because it creates a (IMO) false 
impression of merging showstoppers. After months of being in -mm, and 
after addressing all issues that were raised (and there was a fair 
amount of review activity December last year iirc), one week prior the 
close of the merge window a 'huge' list of issues are raised. (after 
belovingly calling the GFS2 code a "huge mess", to create a positive and 
productive tone for the review discussion i guess.)
So far in my reading there are only 2 serious ones in that list:
 - tty_* use in cluster-aware quota.c. Firstly, ocfs2 doesnt do quota -
   which is fair enough, but this also means that there was no in-tree 
   filesystem to base stuff off. Secondly, the tty_* use was inherited 
   from fs/quota.c - hardly something i'd consider a fatal sin. Anyway, 
   despite the mitigating factors it is an arguably lame thing and 
   it should be (and will be) fixed.
 - GFP_NOFAIL: most other journalling filesystems seem to be doing this
   or worse. Fixing it is _hard_. Suddenly this becomes a showstopper? 
   Huh?
(the "use the generic facilities" arguments are only valid if the 
generic facilities can be used as-is, and if they are just optimal as 
the one implemented by the filesystem.)
