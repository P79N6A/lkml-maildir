     I can't right now because I didn't enable the key when I built the kernel. 
At a later time I will build a kernel with that enabled and try those patches,
at least if 2.2.13pre3 with fixes to address same isn't already out.
     At this point I've gone back to 2.2.10, but applied the Sparc assembly
patch that Dave sent me for 2.2.12 since the assembly was same, and see what
happens with that. I've got to get some sleep, been up all night.  Crash on the
news server is a real painful experience owing to the hour-long fsck that
follows each time. 
     Even with your schedualer patch, 2.2.12 also seems noticably slower than
2.2.10 was with same, even before it manages to run itself out of memory.
     It would be my obvious preference to work as stay as close to the
distributed tree and current and get the bugs worked out in that so that the
fixes are propogated to future releases, but right now I just have to get A
stable 2.2.x kernel so that the machines will at least stay up and running when
I'm not actively babysitting them.
