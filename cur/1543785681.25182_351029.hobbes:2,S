In certain configurations IBM's DS8000 uses 2nd level addressing with
flat space addressing method (01b). Thus ending up with 8 byte LUNs
where the first 4 bytes are really used, e.g. 40:ab:40:cd:00:00:00:00.
This allows to address more than 0x3fff LUNs. But I don't know whether
that many LUNs can be configured in practice.
BTW, zfcp really handles 8 byte LUNs using "unsigned long long" on
big (endian) iron ;-)
(However LUNs have to be configured via sysfs - no LUN scanning
supported at the moment ;-(
