Just so that the archive contains the answer to this question (dealt with
in private mail), the problem was that "lp=auto" had crept in to the
kernel command line.  This has the effect of only setting lp up on ports
with IEEE1284 device IDs corresponding to printers.
When the printer is off, it doesn't respond to the IEEE1284 device ID
probe, and so lp decides that there can't be anything interesting there.
