Subject: [PATCH] Pentium IV cacheline size.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Currently, we're using a L1_CACHE_SHIFT value of 7
for Pentium 4, which equates to 128 byte cache lines.
Curious, I dumped the info on the only P4 I could find,
and noticed they were 64 byte.
Upon checking the documentation, they're 64 byte there too. 
Is this just a thinko on someones part, or was there a
rationale behind this that I've not realised ?
If it is wrong, patch below sets it back to 64 bytes.
regards,
Dave.
