Please don't do this. With ==NULL/!=NULL, it is clear what
<randomvariable> could be (integer or pointer) without needing
to look it up. It also reads quite strange: "if not buffer".
For bools ('adjectives' / 'is a'), it works, not so much for ptrs.

Not agreed.

well, yes.

Yes.
And I'd also like to mention one rather special case where I'd rather
like to see ==0 than ! for clarity (!strcmp looks like !streq, so
one needs to look twice to get it):
	if (!strcmp(hay, needle))
At least don't force the '!' doctrine.
