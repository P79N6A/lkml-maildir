Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Andrew, unless you stop me right now, I am going to send the following
patches in addition:
	[PATCH] kill cancel_rearming_delayed_workqueue()
		cancel_rearming_delayed_workqueue(wq, dwork) does not
		need the first parameter, it could be figured out from
		dwork. So we can rename it to cancel_rearming_delayed_work
		after the simple change and fix all callers.
		In other words:
			- cancel_rearming_delayed_work(dwork) will work
			  for any workqueue, not just keventd_wq.
			- all callers of cancel_rearming_delayed_workqueue()
			  will be converted to use it.
		No? This breaks the public interface, but we already did
		this recently ...
	[PATCH] kill flush_work_keventd()
		The same is true for flush_work(), it doesn't need the
		"struct workqueue_struct *wq" parameter. I missed this
		fact when I was doing flush_work().
		This change is obviously good to do before flush_work()
		goes to mainline.
		Also, I think the name "flush_work" is very bad. Isn't
		it better to rename it as well?
		cancel_work? cancel_work_sync? whatever.
	[PATCH] bonus: mark kernel/workqueue.c as CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL
		too many non-reviewed changes ...
Oleg.
