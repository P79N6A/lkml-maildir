Hello Dave,                                                           
first of all: thank you for your clear statement.                     
Unfortunately your world and our (linux-) world do not match (in my   
eyes). If you cannot provide either docs or source code chances will  
be very high that your product  line (chips) will be disliked by a big
percentage of linux using people. Most of them do not like w*ndows    
because they cannot control what the system is doing, you are _never_ 
sure what it does to your (personal) data and where it will be spread.
If you - being a linux user - would be willing to use binary-only     
drivers you are just about in the same situation - you lost control.  
Your statement - for me - makes one thing absolutely clear: I will    
never use your chips.

> used as well as the ADSL protocol that you have.  I will see what I 
can                                                                   
> do to get you a usable driver.                                      
I do not want a useable driver. I want to have full control over my   
system where my personal data resides on. You deny this. I cannot     
certify a customer system including your drivers either. Simply       
because I cannot check out the code. This is why my customers will not
buy your chips either.                                                
In fact I would not even take them as free gift. Their use is a severe
security issue.                                                       
I have no doubts though that you might sell a lot of pieces in the    
w*ndows market.                                                       
Regards,                                                              
Stephan
