Ah, and I didn't believe people when I said this wasn't going to be a
problem...:

EVERY TIME you move a different .config file from a different kernel
version you HAVE to run 'make oldconfig' to fix up the differences.
This means everytime you upgrade your kernel version, you have to do it
before rebuilding the kernel.
I think the 2.5 Makefile now detects this condition and will tell you to
run it.
