My system is a kt133a, that show the bug. I have run a hundred tests,
first in a Athlon optimized kernel with the patch (55.7=0) then with a non
optimized kernel (55.7=1).
Here are some typical results:
K7 optimized:
Athlon test program $Id: fast.c,v 1.6 2000/09/23 09:05:45 arjan Exp $ 
clear_page() tests 
clear_page function 'warm up run'        took 19862 cycles per page
clear_page function '2.4 non MMX'        took 12296 cycles per page
clear_page function '2.4 MMX fallback'   took 12068 cycles per page
clear_page function '2.4 MMX version'    took 14936 cycles per page
clear_page function 'faster_clear_page'  took 4393 cycles per page
clear_page function 'even_faster_clear'  took 4362 cycles per page
copy_page() tests 
copy_page function 'warm up run'         took 22513 cycles per page
copy_page function '2.4 non MMX'         took 26280 cycles per page
copy_page function '2.4 MMX fallback'    took 26275 cycles per page
copy_page function '2.4 MMX version'     took 22537 cycles per page
copy_page function 'faster_copy'         took 10983 cycles per page
copy_page function 'even_faster'         took 11122 cycles per page
and here without:

clear_page() tests

clear_page function '2.4 MMX version'    took 12021 cycles per page
clear_page function 'faster_clear_page'  took 4401 cycles per page
clear_page function 'even_faster_clear'  took 4370 cycles per page
copy_page() tests 
copy_page function 'warm up run'         took 19568 cycles per page
copy_page function '2.4 non MMX'         took 25353 cycles per page
copy_page function '2.4 MMX fallback'    took 25316 cycles per page
copy_page function '2.4 MMX version'     took 19541 cycles per page
copy_page function 'faster_copy'         took 11052 cycles per page
copy_page function 'even_faster'         took 10785 cycles per page
I thought that when I run the program in the non-optimized kernel with
55.7=1, the program was supposed to crash the system, but it doesn't seem
to do. Isn't the program the K7 optimized fast_copy_page()? Weird.
