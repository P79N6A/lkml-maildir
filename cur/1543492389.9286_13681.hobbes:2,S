Several of the later egcs snapshots built kernels that did do no
networking, both on i586 and SPARC at least. The latest snapshot (19990405,
aka 2.93.17) works fine again (that's what I'm currently using). egcs-1.1.2
(aka 2.93.66) also works fine, but the above 2.91.63 (a pre-release for
1.1.2, AFAIKT) did _not_ produce broken kernels AFAIR.
Please upgrade your compiler to egcs-1.1.2.
