Subject: [2.6 PATCH] NTFS: Critical bug fix (affects MIPS and possibly others).

Hi Linus/Andrew,
Please apply the below patch.  It fixes a crash in NTFS on architectures 
where flush_dcache_page() is a real function.  I never noticed this as all 
my testing is done on i386 where flush_dcache_page() is NULL.
Many thanks to Pauline Ng for the detailed bug report and analysis!
Best regards,
	Anton
