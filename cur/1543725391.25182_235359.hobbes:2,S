The patch below does:
1. let 4KSTACKS depend on EXPERIMENTAL
Rationale:
4Kb stacks on i386 are the future. But currently this option might still 
cause problems in some areas of the kernel. OTOH, 4Kb stacks isn't a big 
gain for most people.
2.6 is a stable kernel series, and 4KSTACKS=n is the safe choice.
Once all issues with 4KSTACKS=y are resolved this can be reverted.
2. let XFS depend on (4KSTACKS=n || BROKEN)
Rationale:
Mark Loy said:
  Don't use 4K stacks and XFS.
Mark this combination as BROKEN until XFS is fixed.
This might result in XFS support disappearing for some people, but if 
they use EXPERIMENTAL=y they should know what they are doing.
The 4KSTACKS option has to be moved for that it's asked before XFS in 
"make config".
