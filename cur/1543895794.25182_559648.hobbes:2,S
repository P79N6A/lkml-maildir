Seems that this patch is not correct - even though the comment above
says "assume no PFC", the subsequent code actually supports PFC:
	/*
	 * Do PFC decompression.
	 * This would be nicer if we were given the actual sk_buff
	 * instead of a char *.
	 */
	if ((obuf[0] & 0x01) != 0) {
		obuf[1] = obuf[0];
		obuf[0] = 0;
		obuf++;
		osize++;
	}
Therefore, depending on the packet contents, the decompressor may
really need that extra byte in the output buffer, and changing the
check may cause buffer overflows.
