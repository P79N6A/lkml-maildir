The Altix console changed from ttyS0 to ttySG0 around 2.6.8.  You need to
  mknod ttySG0 c 204 40
and change elilo.conf to use console=ttySG0 for the newer kernels.  You
also need to change /etc/inittab from ttyS0 to ttySG0.
Most Altix systems running 2.6 have both ttyS0 and ttySG0 defined in
/dev and have two lines in /etc/inittab to allow switching between old
and new kernels.
