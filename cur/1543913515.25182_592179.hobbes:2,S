What's the problem with trying to lock it?
In the paths where you insert this assertion, you will be locked.
So the trylock will fail and not cause any blocking or something else.
It's basically not more expensive than your mutex_locked test.
And the !mutex_locked test might not work on UP (Not sure, about
the current implementation.)
