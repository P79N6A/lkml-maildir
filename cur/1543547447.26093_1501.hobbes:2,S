Not really.
The real problem is that threads - just like pointers, incidentally -  
react *far* worse to getting it wrong than most abstractions do, that is,  
threads (and pointers) are often hard to debug.
And like all abstractions, they don't do you much good unless you have a  
sane way of describing your problem in the terms of this abstraction.
Once you *do* have that, however, threads can be a really nice fit for  
your problem. Just don't try to force-fit them on something different.
All of this, of course, is looking from the programming-abstraction point  
of view. It's much harder to get right from the performance-sucks point of  
view.
(Fortunately, getting it right the first way can lead to getting it right  
the second way.)
Essentially, it usually comes down to the same thing: get a good high- 
level description of your problem. Without it, you're fucked.
*That* is where the most energy should be spent.
Then, code it, and debug it.

Often easier than pointers, IME.
Of course, in both cases using some conventions can help bigtime.

In my current job project, structure went state machines -> coroutines ->  
threads. Both conversions eliminated buttloads of bugs. I wish I had  
started out with threads in the first place (it wasn't possible in the  
circumstances). That would have solved *so* much headache.
And there was the equivalent of race conditions even back in the state  
machine version. Except they were *much* harder to solve there.
Oh, and the code still has state machines - *where they make sense*.  
Something with several tens of KB of internal state and complex logic  
isn't where they make sense.
(Oh, and as to "one thread per connection doesn't scale" argument: thread  
overhead say 8KB, connection local data 50-200KB - if the *thread*  
overhead kills you, you were dead anyway.)
> state - don't bother with threads. Same as with rewrite in assmebler - do
I've never seen a problem solved with threads that *didn't* have shared  
state. Ok, some only had shared state in the file system, so I know what  
you mean :-)
In any case, the canonical example of a program that absolutely *MUST*  
have threads is an OS kernel. You can crunch it down to a micro kernel,  
but that sucks in other ways, and your servers will probably need their  
own threading anyway.

Right; the assembler problem is vastly different, though: here, you're  
*giving up* abstractions. Don't do that unless you have no choice.

That's why the threaded version of this project often uses producer- 
consumer message queues for internal communication. Much easier to get one  
queue right than three dozen shared variables, all subtly different.
Another case of "chose the right abstraction".

Not for inherently parallel stuff it's not. Definitely not. Complex state  
machines are *hard* to understand.

And that was often when I said "I wish I had threads instead of these  
bloody state machines". Now I have, and boy has it helped a lot.

In this you're wrong.
