 In "82489DX Datasheet" Intel explicitly points to masking and unmasking
an interrupt pin in an I/O APIC as one of three ways of controlling
incoming interrupts (other two being the Task Priority Register in a local
APIC and the IF flag in a CPU) at run time.  So far this is about the only
exhaustive APIC architecture description (a few further hints are also
present in "AP-388 82489DX User's Manual" but the datasheet is mostly a
superset).  I haven't seen any other APIC architecture description -- all
others are mostly register programming guidelines only.
 Neither of these documents are available online, AFAIK.  Last year I
asked Intel if providing electronic copies is possible, but they replied
it's not.
