If we want to have more than one probe connected to a marker at a given
time (LTTng, or blktrace, ssytemtap) then we need this patch. Without it,
connecting a second probe handler to a marker will fail.
It allow us, for instance, to do interesting combinations :
Do standard tracing with LTTng and, eventually, to compute statistics
with SystemTAP, or to have a special trigger on an event that would call
a systemtap script which would stop flight recorder tracing.
