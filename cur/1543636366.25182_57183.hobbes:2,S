Subject: [PATCH: NEW SUBARCHITECTURE FOR 2.5.26] support for NCR voyager  (3/4/5xxx series)

This patch adds SMP (and UP) support for voyager which is an (up to 32 way) 
SMP microchannel non-PC architecture.
There's basically nothing different from the 2.5.21 one except for updates and 
changes to the arch-split and a few file tidy ups in mach-voyager.
The patch is in two parts:  The i386 sub-architecture split is separated from 
the addition of the voyager components

You must apply the split diff before applying the voyager one.
These two patches are also available as separate bitkeeper trees (the voyager 
tree is a superset of the arch-split one):
