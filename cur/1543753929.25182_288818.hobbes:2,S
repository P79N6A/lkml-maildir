Subject: [PATCH 0/8] core-small: Introduce CONFIG_CORE_SMALL from -tiny
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This set of patches introduces a new config option CONFIG_CORE_SMALL
from the -tiny tree for small systems. This series should apply
cleanly against 2.6.11-rc1-mm2.
When selected, it enables various tweaks to miscellaneous core data
structures to shrink their size on small systems. While each tweak is
fairly small, in aggregate they can save a substantial amount of
memory.
1 Add option to embedded menu
2 Collapse major names hash
3 Collapse chrdevs hash
4 Shrink PID lookup tables
5 Shrink uid hash
6 Shrink futex queue hash
7 Shrink timer lists
8 Shrink console buffer
