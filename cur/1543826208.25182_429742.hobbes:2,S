Yeah, that does make sense, but I think the IRQ_PENDING idea works too.
This way disable_irq_handler doesn't need to mask the interrupt even
without the irqpoll and irqfixup.  Let the interrupt happen and just
skip those handlers that that are disabled.  Then when the handler is
re-enabled, then we can call the handler. Of course we would need a
enable_irq_handler too.
This would make the vortex card's disable_irq not hurt all the other
devices that share the irq with it.
