I plan resend the series (OF MMC SPI) some time between 2.6.28-rc0
and -rc1, that is, when all needed powerpc patches will be merged
into the Linus' tree.
Though, the $subject patch could be merged anytime as it doesn't
depend on anything else. So, if you'll merge it earlier, that will
make things a bit easier: -1 patch to resend. ;-)
