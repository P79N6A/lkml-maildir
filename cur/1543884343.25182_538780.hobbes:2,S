Doesn't need to be ELF notes.  The current (3.0.5+) domain builder has 
pluggable binary parsers.  Right now there are two:  ELF (obviously ...) 
and binary (with a multiboot-like header).  Filling the informations 
such as virt_base is a function of the parser, so when adding one more 
parser to the domain builder for bzImage kernels the parser could do 
something completely different to gather the needed information ...

Yep, although already much better than completely different kernels. 
Most space of a typical distro kernel is modules which are shared even 
with different kernel binaries.

Yep, should work fine.

I'd expect that work better too.

Xen direct paging mode requiring (leaf) page tables being mapped 
read-only makes page table manipulation a bit difficult.  Xen has to 
care whenever the memory it maps is a page table.  Native hasn't.
Also switching to a completely different set of page tables isn't easy 
under Xen.  My xen guest kexec patches have to perform some intresting 
tricks because of that ...

Doesn't solve the problem of having to switch from identity mapping to 
the 0xc0000000 one ...
