Apparently, it was the RH9 system that was the problem.  The FC2 system
does not have the problem.  I was using the RH9 system for compiling
because it has a 1333 MHz Athlon, while the FC2 system only has a 300 MHz
PII (so I never allowed a complete compilation on that system).  The RH9
system is scheduled for updating to FC3 this weekend or the next.
Thanks for the assistance.
