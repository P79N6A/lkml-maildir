Anton,
	Working with the following config
	hda : dos partitioning
	hdb : ldm
	When plugging LDM in both 2.6.4 & 2.6.5 I have VFS unable to mount
the /dev/hda7 original root device.
(This won't happen just before building both kernels without that support
...)
If I diff configs with/out advanced partition selection:
Without :
CONFIG_MSDOS_PARTITION=y
With:
-CONFIG_MSDOS_PARTITION=y
+CONFIG_PARTITION_ADVANCED=y
Does it mean I can't work in hybrid mode ?
Regards,
Fabian
