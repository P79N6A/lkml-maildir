Hello,
	Recently I compiled kernel -2.2.5 (zImage). I was not able to
install it using LILO because LILO said that it was too big. So I compiled
a bzImage. It was installed by LILO. Next time I tried to boot the new
kerel, I got " crc error - cannot load"  or some mundane message like
that. I repeated the boot. It booted fine. Curious, I repeated the
process i.e. recomiled a bzImage and installed it. The same thing happened
again. Can anyone explain what is happening? Or has anyone had similar
experiences.
regards.
