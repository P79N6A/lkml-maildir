Alas:

So your klogd tried to interpret the trace and screwed it up.  Then
ksymoops tried to interpret klogd's output and screwed it up.
Could you please change you init scripts so `klogd' is 
started with the `-x' option and then restart your logging
daemons?  There's a reasonable chance that if you do this
your klogd will segfault and stop working when it sees the
trace - I'm not sure if Debian have fixed this one.
Alternatively, if you still have that kernel,
cd /usr/src/linux
gdb vmlinux
x/10i 0xc01e5be0
x/10i 0xc02200d4
x/10i 0xc012bb44
x/10i 0xc01288ad
[etc]
That should (finally) tell us where the allocations are occurring.
