That often seems to be the case, the kernel thinks there's an i/o going 
on which isn't, and doesn't time it out. It would be nice if there were 
a way to get the kernel to abort all outstanding i/o on kill -9, but I'm 
sure if it were easy it would have happened. Timeouts in the application 
are useful, but in some cases I believe the process dies because it 
detects a long i/o time but has nothing to do but terminate, which 
creates the zombie.
