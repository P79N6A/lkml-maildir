I'm not sure it is. It only makes more work for everyone else: We have
to help people figure out what causes their computer to fail to resume
(which can take quite a while), then get them them complain to driver
author, and the driver author has to submit patches to fix it.
All of this is avoided if they'll just do it right in the first place.

That's probably a good idea too, since I'm only suggesting this for new
drivers.
