Nothing specific, I just need to know if it's working on other setups too :)
Just compile it with DEBUG=true and let the '/etc/hotplug.d/default/udev.hotplug'
symlink point to udevsend instead of udev. udevd will be automatically started.
On reboot the first sequence I get in the syslog is 138 and udevd is pid [51].
Don't mount /udev as tmpfs. udevd places its socket and lock file in there,
long before you mount it over. I just recognized it cause I had two
udevd running. /var/lock doesn't work cause it's also cleaned up after we
are running.
You may watch the syslog while connecting/disconnecting devices, to see if
the events are applied in the right order.
thanks,
Kay
