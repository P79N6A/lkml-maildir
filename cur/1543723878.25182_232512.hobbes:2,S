Hi Andrew, Kevin,
Kevin is correct.  It's more of the nonsense related to having a counter
in the upper bits of the id.  If you call idr_find with an id that is
beyond the currently allocated space it ignores the upper bits and
returns one of the entries that is in the allocated space.  This
aliasing is most annoying.
I'm attaching an untested patch which removes the counter in the upper
bits of the id and makes idr_find return NULL if the requested id is
beyond the allocated space.  I suspect that there are problems with
id values which are less than zero.
