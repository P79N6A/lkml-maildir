Here's a question about SCSI driver module loading.
There's Qlogic2200 HBA inserted in my machine.
I want to establish some dependency relationship between qlogic driver and
my SCSI driver (like scsi_debug) so that they can be loaded/unloaded
together. Basically, I want my SCSI driver (say, scsi_debug) loaded after
sd/sg driver and before all other low level SCSI HBA drivers(like qla
driver). In modules.conf file, I added
alias scsi_hostadapter qla2200
add above scsi_hostadapter scsi_debug
I didn't make initrd since the Qlogic driver is not essential to the system
boot.
Anyway, Qlogic driver is loaded, but scsi_debug is not.
In the shell, if I type
modprobe scsi_hostadapter 
it will load scsi_debug module.
If I type
modprobe qla2200,
it will not.  (Why??)
And, if I modified modules.conf like the following:
alias scsi_hostadapter qla2200
add above qla2200 scsi_debug
Kernel will panic! 
My questions are:
1. When and how ia the alogic driver loaded in boot time (my machine has the
qlogic card).
2. How can I modify modules.conf (or possibly other way, e.g. rc script or
depmod) so that I can establish some dependency relationship between qlogic
driver and other SCSI drivers so that they can be loaded/unloaded together?
3. Do I need to load qlogic driver and my scsi_debug with initrd?
Thanks.
