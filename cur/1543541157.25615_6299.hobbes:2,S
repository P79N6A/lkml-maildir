set_palette itself takes care of vcmode != KD_GRAPHICS for X. I
do not see any relation between whether console driver updated screen
itself and updating palette, so I believe that console.c in 2.4.0-test6-pre9
is correct...

I think that both fixes are needed. With console.c from test6-pre8
"echo ^[]P0FF0000" behaves a bit unexpected during VT switches, as
      ^^ ESC
palette is not reprogrammed... (tested with plain test5 + vgacon;
test6-pre9 + vgacon or fbcon does it right).
