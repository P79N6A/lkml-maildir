Personally I prefer drivers/modem, as we may well need to include ADSL
support eventually.  Then again, current sound & modem hardware is
increasingly integrated.

It's soft real time if you don't mind the line possibly being dropped.
I suspect you don't, because it might get dropped anyway.

No, missing the deadline once every minute means a buffer underrun, and
a sudden loss of signal.  (Unless the kernel fills in with idle frames,
but that is not so easy with V34 if the main modulation is in user
space).  A sudden loss of signal should simply stall some modems
including ours, but will probably make cheaper modems at the other end
drop the line.

I'm thinking 10-20ms should be ok so long as the low latency kernel
patches can make that reliable.  I've read that one chipset has special
hardware support so that 20ms delay in the OS responding is acceptable.
Apparently this is a feature.  So maybe there is hardware that must get
a faster interrupt response.  But a faster interrupt requirement should
be ok with the low latency patch -- 2-4ms has been mentioned on this list.

I've been planning a framework that uses two RT tasks for the critical
stuff, the Tx one having slightly higher priority than Rx.  Ingo's low
latency patch seems to provide us with reliably low jitter.  Smaller
buffers reduce latency which is important for Quake players, but I don't
think <20ms latency is critical.  Not underrunning is, however.  So my
code will estimate the typical latency and jitter to decide how long the
buffers should be.
What is critical is knowing exactly when each sample is sent and
received.  But that is relatively easy with the right interface.
I would like to use the DSP where available.
Basically we do need some kernel code, but modulation & demodulation
_probably_ do not need to go there, and none of the higher protocols
need to.

Yes, we need to do a lot of work on line simulation if we're to tune the
modem to work well.
Real lines not only add noise: they add other sounds, echos, frequency
distortion, nonlinear distortion, exchange quantisation noise and
clamping, and mismatched sample rates with unknown DAC/ADC
characteristics.  At least.

Heh.  Or at 5 times the normal speed (10 if you can use stereo) over a
sound card with greater dynamic range and sample rate :-)
