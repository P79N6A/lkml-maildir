The problem is the line:
                                retval = p->pid;
!!!                             if (p->real_parent != p->parent || p->ptrace) {
                                        write_lock_irq(&tasklist_lock);
                                        remove_parent(p);
                                        p->parent = p->real_parent;
                                        add_parent(p, p->parent);
                                        do_notify_parent(p, SIGCHLD);
					write_unlock_irq(&tasklist_lock);
                                } else  
                                        release_task(p);
p->ptrace continues to be true, even if the real parent is waiting for
it.  So we go through this code time after time once p->real_parent ==
p->parent, sending it extra SIGCHLDs and not releasing the task.  I
don't think that change is correct but I'm not clear what you're doing
with the reparenting right now, so I don't know the right fix.
You might want to add:
gdb /bin/ls
run
run
to your stress testing in the future.
