Hello,
	I am currently programming a few utilities under Linux to allow me to test
VOIP Equipement from multiple vendors in my lab. One of the tests I would
like to conduct is a latency test. The test as I see it would have two VOIP
Gateways connected to a Linux box with two Ethernet adapters. I would
configure the Linux box to route traffic between the two gateways. What I
would like to know is if it is a big undertaking to have the kernel TCP/IP
Code stall the packets for say between 10ms to 500ms?
If anyone has an idea or can point me into a direction as to how I could
accomplish I would appreciate greatly!
thank you.
