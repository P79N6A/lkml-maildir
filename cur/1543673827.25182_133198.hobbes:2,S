I've just posted a fix for the compile error.
APM suspend and resume now use the save and restore processor state
procedures in suspend.c. The only alternative is to duplicate that
functionality in apm.c or a new "suspend-but-not-tied-to-acpi.c" file.
But suspend.c is fairly generic so it makes sense to share it with APM.
The suspend.c changes are cleanups. The variables are only used in acpi's
suspend_asm.S and acpi/wakeup.S, so I moved them to suspend_asm.S since
they aren't needed when suspend is done by APM. fix_processor_context()
isn't used outside of suspend.c so I made it static.
Do you still have a problem with this?
