Subject: 2.4 IDE slowdown (misconfigure)

This seems to have fixed the 66% slowdown -- disk speeds w/hdparm.  They are
reading in the same range.
For others -- my problem was that I upgraded from a 2.2.x config -- I
thought 'make xconfig' would add additional new params as needed as
'make config' does.  Guess I thought wrong.  
Thanks, Andre, for the quick help/fix!
