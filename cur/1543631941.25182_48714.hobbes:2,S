Man..it's like Farenheit 451, but more like "Hex 0xffff"

I tend to agree with Karim here for sure. It's human nature to overcome
adversity, and this is adversity in one frame of mind, not from
different points of view. (Just to clarify the MPAA see adversity in
certain aspects of the OSS community I think, but they're the opressors,
not us).
Also, in the paragraph about "GPL or bugger off", if you feel it's over
the top, then it's possible others will too, and then it's simply
survival of the fittest. People must change to a degree, but the message
they carry is, and probably will remain, the same.
