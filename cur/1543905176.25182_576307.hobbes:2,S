This is just wrong: AFAIK nobody is stopping Con or any other people from
continuing developing SD or any other scheduler, and CFS certainly is subject
to criticism. The idea that Linux can't use other innovative ideas in the scheduler
is only in your mind.

Get real: I don't the linux development has always been "friendly". The idea
of a "GNU-hippie community" where everybody is good and helps others and
shares their pots is what the Sun bloggers seem to think that opensolaris
should resemble, but it doesn't matches the real world.
