put_mod_name calls free_page which always implies a memory barrier.  This
isn't beautiful but it won't blow up either.
Actually that isn't relevant since the actual table is copied _after_
ex_table_{start,end}.  We'll scan uninitialized memory and if some word
happens to match the fault EIP we jump to the bogus fixup.

True.
