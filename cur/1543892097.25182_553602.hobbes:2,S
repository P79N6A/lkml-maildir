Yes, that's certainly wrong, but that's an implementation issue. I was
more concerned about the design of the API.
Naively, I would expect a reads on a signalfd to return either process
signals or thread signals targeted towards the thread doing the read.
What it actually does (delivering process signals or thread signals
targeted towards the thread that created the signalfd) is weird.
For one, it means you can't create a single signalfd, stick it in an
epoll set, and then wait on that set from multiple threads.
