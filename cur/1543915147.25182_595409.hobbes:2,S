In which case I will need to NAK the patch... Note that those Xserve
G4's still have the subtle issue that they -also- reassign bus
numbers :-) But that's going away the day I finally enable domains
support for ppc32 (it's been off for now due to problems with X)

Right now, we have code to completely build a pci_dev from the firmware
infos. We only use it on 64 bits pseries currently though.

At this stage (but we are getting a bit OT), ppc has something like 3
different PCI code implementations :-) I do have some plans to fix that
by switching everybody to use pci_assign_unassigned_resources() and
friends but last time I tried, everything blew up :-) I suspect I'll
need a quirk or two in the generic code, but I'll let you know when I
get to it.
Cheers,
Ben.
