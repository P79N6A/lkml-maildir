No. If you do the inline assembly (or call the vDSO) yourself of course
it's still possible.
However, the _example_ that the OP gave of this 'third one' was in fact
using the old _syscallX() macros which used to be found in the kernel's
private header files. So I assumed that's what he meant, rather than
open-coding his own inline assembly.
