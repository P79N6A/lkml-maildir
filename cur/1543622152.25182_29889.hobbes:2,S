Let it remove itself, in due time.

That's the key question, from my perspective.
I was not aware of any need for instant migration, and to
the best of my knowledge, a clock tick latency was just fine.
But if your intuition suggests its worth supporting instant
migration, go for it.
The main concern I had with Erich Focht's patches that also
attempted instant migration was that Ingo wouldn't agree.
Somehow, I don't think that concern applies for your patches.
Thanks, Ingo!  I'm delighted with the outcome.
