Hi all,
I'm one of the NFSv4 developers at the University of Michigan.
I'm about to post patches against 2.5.31 which import basic NFSv4
functionality, but have run into a last-minute snag regarding licensing.
We currently use a BSD-style license with the "advertising clause"
removed.  It is my understanding that this license is compatible with
the GPL, and therefore OK as far as Linux is concerned (even though
the standard BSD license is not).  Can anyone confirm this?  Changing
the license might be a time-consuming process involving squads of
University lawyers (ugh!)
For completeness, I've included the full text of the license here.
