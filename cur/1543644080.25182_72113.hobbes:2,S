So, where did you put those 800 MB of kernel stacks needed for
100,000 threads ?
If you used the standard 3:1 user/kernel split you'd be using
all of ZONE_NORMAL for kernel stacks, but if you use a 2:2 split
you'll end up with a lot less user space (bad if you want to
have many threads in the same address space).
Do you have some special solutions up your sleeve or is this
in the category of as-of-yet unsolved problems ?
regards,
Rik
