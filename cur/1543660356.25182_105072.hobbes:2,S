The RAID0 doesn't work in 2.4.21-pre3aa1 in my computer, while it is fine with 
2.4.21-pre3 and 2.4.20-aa1.
The hardware and software details continue to be the same as per the previous 
report ( http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=104093932820352&w=2 
).
Please cc me if you can, sorry if it is a known issue. Thanks.
