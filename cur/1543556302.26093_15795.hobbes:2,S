Have a static 'char *' somewhere.  In the "root=" callback function,
just set this variable.  Do not parse it until you are ready to
actually mount root, then just parse one dev at a time.  No allocation
needed.
Note that this approach doesn't support the "multiple root=" feature,
which brings us to...

Agreed, and there *is* good reason not to support this, since it is
useful to be able to override a root= given in a config file.

Hmm.  LILO shouldn't care, but it does, because it has a 'root='
parameter which it handles specially, by patching the 16-bit device
number into the kernel image at runtime.  Your patch should be fully
functional, though, as long as people just use 'append="root=..."'
instead of simply 'root=...'.  The append= forces LILO not to treat the
root dev specially.  (This tip brought to you by the devfs docs.)
