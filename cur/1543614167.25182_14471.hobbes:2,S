Dude, I don't know why you are being so pedantic on this.
You pointed to the stupid exceptions instead of the norm.
100% of the negative power prefixes ARE lower case, and all of the
positive power prefixes ARE UPPERCASE except those three stupid 
exceptions which you cited.  Here, SI is being stupid.    Uppercase 
is a GOOD IDEA (TM).  And, NIST should fix this because the
point of standards is to create logical consistancy so that people
don't get into these stupid discussions.
Finally, I'm an American, so that means if someone tells me to do
something stupid, I tell them where they can shove it.

And I already agreed to this, as have most of the others.
