Hello Chuck,
As you requested i have finally found out that the problem was 
introduced in 2.6.22 (2.6.21.7 works, after 2.6.21.7 theres 2.6.22)
I have also examined the changeslogs: 2.6.22 introduce a certain number 
of patches into NFS client. Many of them are yours and Trond's.
Pls can you help with this ?
TIA
Gianluca
