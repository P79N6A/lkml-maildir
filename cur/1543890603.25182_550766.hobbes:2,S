That explains so much! "SELinux: you're too dumb to use it, so just keep
your hands in your pockets." :-)
AppArmor was designed to allow your average sys admin to write a
security policy. It makes different design choices than SELinux to
achieve that goal. As a result, AppArmor is an utter failure when
compared to SELinux's goals, and SELinux in turn is an utter failure
when compared to AppArmor's goals.
Which is why we have LSM: so we don't have to have this argument here,
again.

That is a tall order. You can mostly achieve it by not giving the user
the root password, but I'm not sure you would like the result :-)
Both SELinux and AppArmor can be configured so tightly that you are not
going to get to install malware, by preventing the user from installing
software. This isn't what users want, so they invariably bypass security
and install shiny things if they own the box. SELinux and AppArmor can't
help but fail if you put them in that kind of harm's way.
