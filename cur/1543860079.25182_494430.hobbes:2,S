it depends on how cache/memory bandwidth sensitive your calculation
is.... if your calculation is memory bandwidth sensitive then they're
the same. If your calculation is very sensitive to have the dataset fit
in cache.. it's another different ballgame again, because then it
depends if the cores in your dual core share the cache or not.
