I suppose.  I was thinking initially that directory parentage alone 
wouldn't suffice, because you could be traversing upwards from a variety 
of places with a complex patch.  But now that I think about it, a patch 
should really only be going in through one git tree, no matter how many 
subsystems it might peripherally touch.  Deciding which tree really 
requires human intelligence, so there's no point trying to automate 
that.  Multiple inheritance would be... bad...
