Ok, so the flush_dcache_page() interface looses this; the original
placement of the flush_page_to_ram() ensured that data written by
device drivers was visible to user space.
Maybe the BIO layer can handle this - the same problem exists when
(and if) BIO uses a bounce buffer, so it would have to be handled
there.  Jens?
Lothar - can you confirm that your problem vanishes when you turn off
write allocation on the caches please?  (cachepolicy=writeback)
