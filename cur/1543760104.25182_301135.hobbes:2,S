Is that really necessary with a stable tree which may only be around
for about 2 months before the next stable tree is forked (which would
have the mature mainline fix in) ?
There is another point here though, which I think is much more important.
Remember that the original issue which caused the -stable tree to be
created was a concern over the testing that Linus' kernels were getting.
Also, realise that by creating a -stable tree, we haven't increased the
number of testers which Linus' kernels are seeing.
Given that, how can we decide that a complex fix has matured enough
in Linus' kernel to warrant replacing a (proven) fix which users are
perfectly happy with in the corresponding -stable tree?
I thought the -stable tree is targeted towards stability, not towards
"lets replace this change with some other because we as developers think
it's better".
