I guess I would prefer the hard line: if it states "linux support" there has to be a driver source - or at least full docs for _any_ requesting parties. Otherwise the trademark should not be useable at all. If you provide several "stages" of support, poor "Aunt Tilly" user (is this already tm'ed? :-) won't be able to understand the difference - and you distro-guys (this is not meant to be a BadName) want this type of user to a certain extent.
But this is a very purist point of view.
Beat me,
Stephan
