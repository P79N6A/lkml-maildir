I have been running successfully with qla2x00src-4.15Beta.tgz for several
months now over several kernel versions up to 2.4.5.
When I tested 2.4.6-pre6 I decided to use the qlogicfc driver -- BAD
MISTAKE!!!
#1 - My system had crashed (for a different reason) and when the raid5 was
resyncing and e2fsck happening at the same time the kernel locked with
messages from qlogicfc.o:
qlogicfc0: no handle slots, this should not happen.
hostdata->queue  is 2a, inptr: 74
I was able to repeat this several times so it's a consistent error.
Waiting for the raid resync to finish did allow this complete -- but now
when I come in the next morning the console is locked up and no network
access either.  So I reset it.  Checked the logs and here it is again:
Jun 29 03:39:21 yeti kernel: qlogicfc0 : no handle slots, this should not
happen.
Jun 29 03:39:21 yeti kernel: hostdata->queued is 36, in_ptr: 13
This was during a tape backup.
So I'm switching back to qla2x00src-4.15Beta.tgz -- which does the resync
and e2fsck just fine together BTW.
Jun 29 06:22:47 yeti kernel: qla2x00: detect() found an HBA
Jun 29 06:22:47 yeti kernel: qla2x00: VID=1077 DID=2100 SSVID=0 SSDID=0
Only problem is I don't see this package on qlogic's website anymore and
their "beta" directory is empty now.  I'm waiting to see what their tech
support says.
