Hello everyone,
  sorry for long response time, but I do not read linux-kernel at home,
so there is a big delay here...

Maybe you should indicate, which X server are you running. There
should be no problems with XFree-SVGA 3.3.2 or 3.3.3... Because of
PLL takes some time to lock (.5 sec on Millennium (I/II)), driver reprograms
PLL only when they changes. That means, if you have same pixclock on all
consoles, PLL is programmed only on boot-up. Could you try to
`fbset -pixclock 21212' on any console (say VT3) and then, after exiting
from X, switch from VT1 to VT3 (and back) ? It should fix problem.
Also, are you using XFree in interlaced videomode ?
[side note: works here with XFree 3.3.3, Mystique; even switching from/to
wine directx fallout2 works ok; switching fbtv <-> X too]

Could you send me some more info (/etc/X11/XF86Config...) privately,
maybe together with lspci -vx (or, if you do not have NCR SCSI, lspci -vxxx).

Maybe you should check, whether MSS and videocards do not try to share
IRQ. I do not play with IRQ state in device, so it should be disabled.
But maybe it is not and MSS code gets sick from spurious frame IRQs
(but I never saw IRQ enabled; did you run, by any chance, Windows before
Linux without hardware reset?)
Also, could you check whether machine dies when switching videomode by
fbset? There is 5sec timeout for PLL to lock, if PLL does not lock in 5 secs,
with current driver machine dies (because of
`printk(KERN_ERR "PLL not locked after 5 secs, all is lost");'... this
printk() inside videodriver kills computer completely (last time it
happened to me, in 2.1.128, there was no SAK, no num-lock, even no reaction
to ATX poweroff button, fortunately `reset' button is hardwired to whole
computer reset)).

It looks to me like that you have big hardware troubles... Could you
send me output of lspci -vxxx + isapnptools config + soundcard settings
+ boot options + output from fbset ?
                                            Thanks,
