Oh, don't get me wrong. I agree completely. A short two minute reply
is not that much to ask for, and I wish Linus would be more
responsive. And apply bugfix patches (I've been trying for weeks
to get him to apply my patches to fix a bunch of Oopses:-().
But years of observations tells me that Linus likes the way he does
things and doesn't care if others don't like it. I don't expect to see
much change there.
But the point I was making was that a patch management system doesn't
really make things harder to drop/ignore. If you're comfortable with
ignoring patches (which take *work* to construct), then it's no
stretch to ignore questions (which often take little work to send).
