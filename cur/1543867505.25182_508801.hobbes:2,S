yeah, that's another key thing. I do plan to provide a sys_upcall() 
syscall as well which calls a 5-parameter user-space function with a 
special stack. (it's like a lightweight signal/event handler, without 
any of the signal handler legacies and overhead - it's like a reverse 
system call - a "user call". Obviously pure userspace would never use 
sys_upcall(), unless as an act of sheer masochism.)
[ that way say a full HTTP request could be done by an asynchronous
  context, because the HTTP parser could be done as a sys_upcall(). ]
so if it's simpler/easier for a syslet to do a step in user-space - as 
long as it's an 'atom' of processing - it can be done.
or if processing is so heavily in user-space that most of the logic 
lives there then just use plain pthreads. There's just no point in 
moving complex user-space code to the syslet side if it's easier/faster 
to do it in user-space. Syslets are there for asynchronous /kernel/ 
execution, and is centered around how the kernel does stuff: system 
calls.
besides sys_upcall() i also plan two other extensions:
 - a CLONE_ASYNC_WORKER for user-space to be able use its pthread as an
   optional worker thread in the async engine. A thread executing
   user-space code qualifies as a 'busy' thread - it has to call into
   sys_async_cachemiss_thread() to 'offer' itself as a ready thread that
   the 'head' could switch to anytime.
 - support for multiple heads sharing the async context pool. All the
   locking logic is there already (because cachemiss threads can already
   access the queue), it only needs a refcount in struct async_head
   (only accessed during fork/exit), and an update to the teardown logic
   (that too is a slowpath).
