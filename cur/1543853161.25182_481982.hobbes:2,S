I have not checked if this is true, but it is a possible explanation:
Perhaps the filesystem is not properly unmounted during a suspend?  That
would mean GRUB is reading from a incoherent filesystem on resume.
GRUB's filesystem drivers are not very fancy.  It could be it does
something silly like check the journal before returning each block.
Maybe its a journal size thing, you could try "sync" before suspend and
see if it helps.  Another thing would be to create /boot as a separate
partition.
