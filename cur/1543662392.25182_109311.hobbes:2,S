Reverse engineering the protocol is probably allowed, as long
as you don't create an alternative implementation yourself.
I can't see how Larry's license would stop people from writing
that alternative implementation, as long as those people don't
use bitkeeper themselves.
This is mostly because the license doesn't forbid creating an
alternative to bitkeeper (I doubt Larry would even want that,
even if the law granted that much power).  All it does is not
grant the free use of bitkeeper to people working on an alternative.
cheers,
Rik
