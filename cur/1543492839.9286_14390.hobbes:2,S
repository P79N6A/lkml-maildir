Since upgraging my servers to 2.2.x one of them has developed a problem
and seems to crash from time to time. These are the last log messages I
got from the last crash.
Apr 13 16:13:30 diamond kernel: ip_rt_bug: 0101288a -> 02e08ac3, eth0
Apr 13 16:15:35 diamond kernel: ip_rt_bug: 0101288a -> 02e08ac3, eth0
Apr 13 16:17:29 diamond kernel: ip_rt_bug: 0101288a -> 02e08ac3, eth0
Can any one tell me why the ip_rt_bug function would be called? And what
this means. The source address appears to be info.city.ac.uk which is
totally unrelated to my network. Is this the sign of an attack on my
network? Would this be enough to crash a machine totally?
Any help on understanding thses messages would be greatly appreciated.
Regards,
Abdul-Wahid
