Okay. What I've done is the following. Unloaded every module except
the ones above before even trying to suspend. Then unloaded the above
modules during suspend, so basically no modules should have been
loaded before shutting down. The result: the same. Blank screen has
not appeared now, I only got the double fault, that is attached to my
previous mail.
In 2.4.22 swsusp works fine for me.
So what's the next step I should do to investigate?
Thx,
Richard
