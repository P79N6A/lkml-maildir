If you notice the ! at the above line, and remind that the original value for 
udelay is 10, you can understand the comment ;)

Your suggestion seems clearer to my eyes. Still the other possibilities are not
from Micronas msp34xx family, but audio decoder chips from other vendors - as
weel as other kind of i2c devices, like IR chips, video encoders, etc.
So, IMO, a better comment would be something like:
 	/* 
 	 * We started with a bigger udelay in order to avoid troubles with some
 	 * msp34xx chips. Boards without msp34xx are known to work with the full
	 * i2c 100 kHz speed.
	 */
I'm C/C the patch author (Hans) for his comments about this, since he is
the one who faced with the problems with msp34xx and ivtv.
Cheers,
