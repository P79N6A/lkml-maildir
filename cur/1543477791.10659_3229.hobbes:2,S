_NO_ I am not suggesting that you keep the trees for all those old kernels.
 I am mearly suggesting that if you do have the kernel image stored on
mounted fs, you do have the ability to figure out what kernel you are
booted to. 
That just goes to show that
	cat .config.in >> zImage 
can yeild your dotconfig even if you don't remember what kernel you booted.
 There are exceptions, but if you can't keep track of your kernel thats
pretty bad.
