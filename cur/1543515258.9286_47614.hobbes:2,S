Hi,
While shutting down a RH6.1 box, running pristine 2.2.13,
I got this message:
Unmounting filesystems kfree: Bad obj c463db80
Followed directly by this oops (I copied it by hand and feeded to
ksymoops):
ksymoops 0.7c on i686 2.2.13.  Options used
     -V (default)
     -k /proc/ksyms (specified)

     -o /lib/modules/2.2.13/ (specified)
     -m /usr/src/linux/System.map (specified)

I've attached my .config to this message
This is the first and only time I got the oops.
I've been unable to reproduce it.
