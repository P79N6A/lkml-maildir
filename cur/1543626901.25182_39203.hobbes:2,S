ok for wafer5823wdt, which I wrote:
Timeout is a single byte, so should be in range 1-255 (and should probably be
a byte not an int...), not 1-3600.
All uses of waf_expect_close should be wrapped in
#ifndef CONFIG_WATCHDOG_NOWAYOUT, rather than just haveing it set to zero
if nowayout is not set. Saves a byte and makes it clearer. Though personally
I think the 'V' to close interface shouldnt be there at all. If you dont
want your watchdog to shut down, use no way out. If you do, then dont.
These may apply to other drivers too.
