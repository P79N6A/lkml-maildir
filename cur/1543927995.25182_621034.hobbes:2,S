Subject: [PATCH 20/27] ptrace: arch_has_block_step
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/25/97

This defines the new macro arch_has_block_step() in linux/ptrace.h, a
default for when asm/ptrace.h does not define it.  This is the analog
of arch_has_single_step() for step-until-branch on machines that have
it.  It declares the new user_enable_block_step function, which goes
with the existing user_enable_single_step and user_disable_single_step.
This is not used yet, but paves the way to harmonize on this interface
for the arch-specific calls on all machines.
