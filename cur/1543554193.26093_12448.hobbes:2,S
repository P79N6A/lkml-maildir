I do think the new code is much better. Anyone who is considering using trunking
for their projects should use the new code since it has link monitoring and
active backup mode. However, I am a maniac when it comes to kernel testing. If I
say it really works, it usually works. This code has been tested much and bugs
were fixed. However, it has not been tested enough that I may bet by head on
saying there are no known issues. This is because I did not have access to all
hardware that was needed to complete the tests in time.
The code is not worse than the old code. However, a clear note must be made that
this is experimental code and probably has small issues. So if it is included,
it must me marked as experimental.
