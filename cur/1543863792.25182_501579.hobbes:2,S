I'd like to make one note here:
We should have a way to use smaller DMA buffers than one page size. If I 
remember correctly, the page size on my system is 4096 bytes, being 1024 
quadlets. If we assume a 4 channel audio stream, this corresponds to 256 
audio samples. This means that the controller generates an interrupt 
every 256 samples, making that we can achieve a latency of 512 samples 
at best. This is unacceptable in a pro-audio environment.
The current stack exhibits this problem, and I solve it by recalculating 
the max packet size, based upon the stream composition (i.e. expected 
packet size) and the requested audio buffer size, such that the 
interrupts are generated at a high enough frequency.
I'm not a kernel hacker, but when looking through the code I had the 
impression that smaller DMA buffers were possible (aren't smaller 
buffers used in packet-per-buffer mode?).

A gap doesn't necessarily have to be a big problem as long as we know 
its position and size. I don't think it's a lot of overhead to skip a 
gap once in a while. Not having any would be better of course.
The ability to skip a gap will have to be implemented in (some) clients 
anyway, because it is not certain that a no-data packet won't contain 
payload. The current class driver for audio devices from Apple sends 
payload along with it's no-data packets. I don't really know if this is 
according to spec, but I assume so (haven't got them at hand).
In our application (FreeBoB), we know in advance what the size of a 
packet is going to be, as we only use blocking transmission. We also 
know how many (non no-data) packets we want to receive before being 
notified (some fraction of the audio buffer size). So we can predict the 
size of the payload buffer rather well. As the average rate of the 
samples in the packets is known (being the samplerate, say 48kHz), the 
average amount of no-data packets can be calculated. Then add some 
margin and we are OK.
I don't see an easy way to use double-buffering for non-blocking 
transmission, that will have to be handled by the normal method.

Wouldn't that be the 'maximum number of headers', because you want the 
payload to trigger the next descriptor switch?
What about having userspace specify the payload they want on a 
descriptor switch (hence interrupt), and the maximum number of headers 
they expect for this payload? For us it is all about the payload...

I don't think that this is really an OHCI limitation but rather a side 
effect of the rather indeterministic nature of isochronous firewire 
transfer.
Thanks for the elaborate answer!
