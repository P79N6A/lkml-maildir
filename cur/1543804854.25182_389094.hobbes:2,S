There isn't, but because it's wider than 80 columns, it got mis-read.
As demonstrated, the 80 column rule _still_ matters for readability.

It's history.  port in serial_struct has been declared as:
        unsigned int    port;
since the year dot, and has been exposed to userland since it's
inception. I guess that 64-bit machines came along, and this was
found to be inadequate.  Rather than deprecate the current interface
and provide a sane API, whoever did this came up with this yucky
solution where
        unsigned int    port_high;
contains the address bits outside the range of "port".  Presumably
they assumed that sizeof(unsigned long) == 2 * sizeof(unsigned int)
here. If not, this silly interface again breaks on us.
