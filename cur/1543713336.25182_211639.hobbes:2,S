Hey Karim,
   The installation has gone through smoothly and I have managed to get an
linux-2.6.3 up and running with LTT.
I checked the documentation and it says that I need to do an insmod on the
tracer but I have compiled it as a part of the kernel. Now the documentation
says that I should execute the createdev.sh to create the devices. When I
execute that I get errors related to tracer. When I try to execute the
tracedaemon I get that relayfs is not mounted. Can you please tell me how to
go about doing the first part. After doing all this I want to run some test
cases and see how does LTT generate traces. Later on I would also like to
add rtai to this and see the traces from that too.
Thanks!

PS. I would like to write down a small howto on this and pass it on to you
so that newbies like me can have a good ref. Thanks for the help.
