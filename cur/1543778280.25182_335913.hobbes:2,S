Hello,
I now could compile the amd64-kernel successfully. I installed it on my
machine, rebooted and in the beginning everything seemed fine. But after
mounting the root (ext 3) filesystem (or before mounting, I do not know
exactly) the machine hangs. The last message I see is:
Mounting root filesystem, starting kjournald.
What can I do now?
