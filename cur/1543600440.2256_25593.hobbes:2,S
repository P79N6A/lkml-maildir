OK, in this case I disagree with you ;)
Disk seek time takes ages, as much as 10 milliseconds.
I really don't think it's good to move the disk arm away
from the data we are reading just to write out this one
disk block.
Going 20 milliseconds out of our way to write out a single
block really can't be worth it in any scenario I can imagine.
OTOH, flushing out 64 or 128 kB at once (or some fraction of
the inactive list, say 5%?) almost certainly is worth it in
many cases.
regards,
Rik
