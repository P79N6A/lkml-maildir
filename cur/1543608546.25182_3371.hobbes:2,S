That's not a noticeable amount, and is perfectly explainable by simply
having deamons that got swapped out with truly inactive pages. So a
swapcache leak does not seem to be the reason for the unstable numbers.

Indeed.
Mind doing some more tests? In particular, the "vm_swap_full()" macro is
only used in two places: mm/memory.c and mm/swapfile.c. Are you willing to
test _which_ one (or is it both together) it is that seems to bring on the
unstable numbers?
