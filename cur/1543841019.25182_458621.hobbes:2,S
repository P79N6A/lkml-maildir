The intend is to see if there's already someone working on, and if so,
then it'll not be good to post oops that has already been taken care
of. I'm trying not to send unnecessary info.
I'll try to get oops in the next few days when I get a chance.
Currently traveling.
Another point ... on IBM x60s notebook, setting ...
       High Memory Support (64GB)
               CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G=y
               CONFIG_RESOURCES_64BIT=y
               CONFIG_X86_PAE=y
will cause resume to "REBOOT" sometimes (may be 6 out of 10).
I was trying to compile a kernel that would run both on the DELL with
16GB RAM, and on my IBM notebook with 2GB RAM.
But without 64 bit support, my notebook will suspend/resume many times
without failing (with the 5 ahci patches from Pavel Machek)....

For this, there's no oops, suspend ok, but upon resume, screen will go
blank, then reboot. With or without X, and console after fresh
startup, same reboot.
Sorry, I don't know how to get oops info, but whatever I can do to
trace down the bug, please show me how.
I'll do anything to make Linux more robust!!! Please lead the way.
Thank,
Jeff.
