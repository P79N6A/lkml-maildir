I am unable to obtain a dhcp lease from my calbe modem provider in this
series.  This problem is possibly related to the tulip driver since that
is the driver used for the card on that interface.  An strace on both
2.3.47 (works) and 2.3.99 (doesn't work) reveals that both give
identical results up through and including the following:
open("/usr/local/bin/dhcpup", O_RDONLY) = 4
lseek(4, 0, SEEK_CUR)                   = 0
read(4, "#!/bin/bash\n/sbin/dhcpcd -d -h c"..., 80) = 47
lseek(4, 0, SEEK_SET)                   = 0
fcntl(4, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC)           = 0
fcntl(4, F_GETFL)                       = 0 (flags O_RDONLY)
fstat(4, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0744, st_size=47, ...}) = 0
lseek(4, 0, SEEK_CUR)                   = 0
read(4, "#!/bin/bash\n/sbin/dhcpcd -d -h c"..., 47) = 47
rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, [INT CHLD], [], 8) = 0
fork()                                  = 493
rt_sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, [], NULL, 8) = 0
rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, [CHLD], [], 8) = 0
rt_sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, [], NULL, 8) = 0
rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, [CHLD], [], 8) = 0
rt_sigaction(SIGINT, {0x805f51c, [], 0x4000000}, {0x804bb38, [HUP INT
ILL TRAP ABRT BUS FPE USR1 SEGV USR2 PIPE ALRM TERM XCPU XFSZ VTALRM
PROF], 0x4000000}, 8) = 0
At this point I get wait4(-1, [WIFEXITED(s) && WEXITSTATUS(s) == 0], 0,
NULL) = 493
on 2.3.47 and an endless string of the following:
wait4(-1, 0xbffff9ec, 0, NULL)          = -1 ECHILD (No child processes)
until dhcpcd times out.  I'm not sure what is relevant to provide here,
so I hope someone can help me out.
