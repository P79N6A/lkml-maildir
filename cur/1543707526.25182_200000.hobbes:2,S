to make a point with regard to:
	no transfer of page contents during suspend/resume
	no netdump
	no debugger access without override
... but the name does not matter and we do not have to change it.

Yes of course - how else would swsusp run, but these data are also not  
"touched"
during suspend and resume wrt transfer of page content.
x86 Pages for PG_nosave:
Video/BIOS 0xA0000-0XFFFFF
Anything reserved < max_pfn
Pentium 2 broken highmem pages
Driver specific areas in DMA zone are also thinkable
.. or else you get mce's or possibly crashes on newer x86 HW and on 64Bit  
for sure.
	- we had a mce recently at 0xa0000 on a Athlon XP and I went digging...
