It merely allows it to occur by accident if root does something like find
in the wrong place and it also breaks the expected behaviour for existing
systems.
There are two ways you can identify a specific controller if the vendor
didn't totally screw up
The first is the PCI idents or subidents, the second is to look at the
tables returned when the controller is being set up. In fact the
Adaptecrap controllers (ex DPT) are already detected and we set
c->adaptec in pci.c so we can stop them exploding for other reasons and
to use some extensions they have.
Thus I think the right solution is to skip registering those proc files
(and unregistering them on unload) if c->adaptec is set.
