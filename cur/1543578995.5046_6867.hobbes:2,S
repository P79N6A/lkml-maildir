	[Venkatesh Ramamurthy]  I think it would be a nice idea if we can
make this process automatic , with out user typing in the order and
remembering it. The fact that a kernel developer is not using the machines
daily to get his work done should be in our minds. If we do this Linux would
become more user friendly
