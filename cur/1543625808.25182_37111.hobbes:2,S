Ok I understand that but hotplug has no way to influence the way the
device is treated by the driver. The only way I can see is via the /proc
interface, but at least it is not possible with this driver.

I have not checked the module loading code but is it possible to define
for an option a vector with an undefined size ? Or do you consider that
all devices use the same option ? (the vortex driver is only limited to
8 cards for the options passed by modutils)
Could you point me to a specific usb driver ?
How is solved the "what to do when a card is removed and then plugged
back in." problem ? By keeping the entry for further use ?
