Yes, the generic layer should expose throttling.
But before it does so, it needs to learn that T-states
have very different implications from P-states.
Indeed it is a bug in the current architecture that
P-states are exposed by cpufreq on some systems,
and T-states are exposed on other systems, and
they are treated like they are the same.
It is also bug that T-states are exposed
on some systems, while ACPI is simultaneously
assuming exclusive access to them for thermal throttling.
