Thanks for this, it shows that other people can do kbuild 2.5 work.
However there are no plans to replace the kernel build method in 2.4
kernels, it is too big a change for a stable kernel.  I have already
extracted several bugs fixes from kbuild 2.5 and fed them to Marcelo or
Alan Cox.
There is a limited amount that can be fixed in the 2.4 kernel build
without a large impact on users.  Anything that forces an upgrade past
make 3.77.1 (the currently required version on 2.4 kernels) is
unacceptable.
