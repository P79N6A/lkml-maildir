I believe this is what splay does.

And it _still_ fails if you force machine into swap so much that it
has to swap player out - at which point it is unusable.

There's no need for this to be DMA buffer. Kernel could store audio
data in linklist of 4K buffers and copy them to DMA buffer as
needed. It could also include lo/hi watermarks: If there is less than
.5meg of audio data, wake userland. Block userland if there is more
than 1meg of audio data available.
This should give good sound. Hmm, and I even believe this is the
easiest yet working solution.
