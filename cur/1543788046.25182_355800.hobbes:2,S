An instruction that atomically compares and swaps n independent memory
locations with n given values. cas-1 (traditional compare-and-swap) is
enough to implement lock-less queue, cas-2 is enough to implement
double-linked lists, and was used by Synthesis lock-free kernel
(
http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/massalin91lockfree.html
).
To be precise, cas-1 is theoretically enough to implement double-linked
lists too, but resulting algorithms are not pretty at all.

Nothing. That was an instance of "rhetorical question", sorry that I
made not this clear enough.

Yes: this is Linux _Kernel_ mailing list, and I was talking about kernel
code and kernel algorithms.
