Ah, OK, thanks for the clarification, it explains a lot.
I've made some more tests on two Intel boards and another VIA board.
The bottom line is that both VIA boards see a bump in power consumption
when plugging my USB 2.0 hard disk drive (10 W on one board, 4 W on the
other) while none of the Intel boards exhibit any change in power
consumption. I wonder if I should blame VIA for eating extra power when
the disk is plugged, or thank them for saving power when it's not. Or
maybe I am looking at things the wrong way, and I should thank AMD for
saving more power in C3 than Intel does?
