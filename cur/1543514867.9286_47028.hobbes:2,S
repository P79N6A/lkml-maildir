Linux is great operating system, but a small part of it, the PCI
initalisation are
not properly documented. This lack of documentation is not a real problem
for
the classic Linux that works on Intel processor. But some linux architecture
like PowerPC use a more complex PCI translation. In this case the lack
of information is a problem. Because some PCI drivers used some #ifdef to
work on different linux architecture...

Linux still go faster these translations need to be done only one time, when
the
driver start.
