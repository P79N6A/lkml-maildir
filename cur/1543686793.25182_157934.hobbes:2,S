It's poorly implemented by a lot of keyboards.
Has anybody actually verified that the keyboards that are presenting
the problem in quesiton are not specifically identifyable by their ID
string, or some other means - E.G. they only exist on specific, known
laptops?
My keyboard has a distinct ID, and works fine in set 3, but isn't
detected as set 3 capable.  I'll have to make a patch some time...
