Patch-bombing you with useless stuff has never been my
objective. I just want to make sure valid patches get
re-sent to you as long as there is a reason to believe
they still need to be sent.
As soon as any hint arrives that the patch shouldn't be
sent right now (a change was made to any of the files the
patch applies to, I see something suspect in the changelog,
the patch was applied, a reply was mailed to the patch...)
the patch will be moved away for manual inspection.
I guess I'll also build in some kind of backoff to make sure
the patch gets sent less often if you're not interested or too
busy.
regards,
Rik
