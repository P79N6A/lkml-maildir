But, how can purgatory get the "backup pages map" information? Which is
not available when purgatory is loaded. I think there are two methods:
Method1:
- A setup page is setup by original kernel, and the address of setup
page is passed to purgatory using a pre-defined protocol (such as in a
register). The "backup pages map" is in setup page.
- Purgatory uses the information in setup page to modify ELF headers
- kexeced kernel use ELF headers to build /proc/vmcore
Method2:
- A setup page is setup by /sbin/kexec
- The "backup pages map" information is written to purgatory
via /proc/kimgcore.
- Purgatory uses the information to modify ELF headers
- kexeced kernel use ELF headers to build /proc/vmcore
But, why not just exchanging the "backup pages map" information between
two kernels via the "setup page"? It is as follow:
- A setup page is setup by original kernel, and the address of setup
page is passed to kexeced kernel using a pre-defined protocol (such as
in a register). The "backup pages map" is in setup page.
- kexec kernel use "backup pages map" to build /proc/vmcore.
To keep it simple, another choice is not passing this "backup pages map"
information between two kernels now. The biggest issue is makedumpfile
can not exclude free pages without it, resulting in big hibernated
image. Another issue is that the information in /proc/vmcore is not
accurate, but that does not affect the hibernation implementation.

/proc/kimgcore is mainly used to save the memory image of the kexeced
kernel. If this is not to be supported, /proc/kimgcore is not needed.
But, I think this is useful to accelerate the hibernating (no another
boot is needed for each hibernating).

Yes. This is a good idea. I will do it.

I think this is a important use case of "kexec jump" besides "kexec
based hibernation". But it can be separated from initial "kexec jump"
patchset if necessary.

Some information (such as "backup pages map") is not available
when /sbin/kexec is executed. So there should be a method to pass such
information to purgatory from original kernel. So why not change the
information between two kernel via "setup page" directly (need not
purgatory).
