Yes, if a driver is available for the device, it will enable it regardless of
the initial state.  Most manual BIOS configuration options don't actually
disable the device in the commonly understood sense.  Rather, they tell the
BIOS not to waste any time configuring the device, as the operating system
is fully capable of doing so.  On operating systems that aren't PnP capable
these options might have a greater effect.
