Subject: [PATCH 0/12] tty layer and misc struct pid conversions
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The aim of this patch set is to start wrapping up the struct pid
conversions.  As such this patchset culminates with the removal
of kill_pg, kill_pg_info, __kill_pg_info, do_each_task_pid, and
while_each_task_pid.
kill_proc, daemonize, and kernel_thread are still in my sights but
there is still work to get to them.
The first three are basic cleanups around disassociate_ctty,
while working on converting it I found several issues.  tty_old_pgrp
can be a tricky concept to wrap your head around.
 1 tty: Make __proc_set_tty static.
 2 tty: Clarify disassociate_ctty
 3 tty: Fix the locking for signal->session in disassociate_ctty
These just stop using the old helper functions.
 4 signal: Use kill_pgrp not kill_pg in the sunos compatibility code.
 5 signal: Rewrite kill_something_info so it uses newer helpers.
Then the grind to convert the tty layer and all of it's helper
functions to struct pid.
 6 pid: Make session_of_pgrp use struct pid instead of pid_t.
 7 pid: Use struct pid for talking about process groups in exit.c
 8 pid: Replace is_orphaned_pgrp with is_current_pgrp_orphaned
 9 tty: Update the tty layer to work with struct pid.
A final helper function update.
10 pid: Replace do/while_each_task_pid with do/while_each_pid_task
And the removal of the functions that are now unused.
11 pid: Remove now unused do_each_task_pid and while_each_task_pid
12 pid: Remove the now unused kill_pg kill_pg_info and __kill_pg_info
All of these should be fairly simple and to the point.
