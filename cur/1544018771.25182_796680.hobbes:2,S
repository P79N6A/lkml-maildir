Yeah that seems the best way to go - not I note that the old drivers/ide
driver programs it right for 16bit I/O or doing mixed 16/32 ..
Patch added to my tree which together with Hugh's change should do the
trick. The others I've checked seem to have no such rule except in VLB
space. Never tried ATAPI in anger on a VLB box but it's easy enough to
address and I'll do a third patch for those.
