It takes, perhaps, a few hundred microseconds on startup to detect
and enable the trap for the F00F bug, then does absolutely nothing
during runtime.
The fix was to move part of the IDT (Interrupt descriptor table) to
where the F00F bug would cause a page-fault so it could be handled
before locking up the machine. If you don't execute the F00F crash-
code, this fault never occurs, so is transparent.
