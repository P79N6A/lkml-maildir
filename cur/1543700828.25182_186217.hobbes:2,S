So maybe suggest an solution rather than shooting one down all the
time (which do seem logical, and is only apposed by one person currently
- namely you =).
I currently run a system with Greg's patches + udev, and all the devices
are generated via udev and a modified version of Robert's initscript
(running much earlier), with only alsa's nodes generated via another
script as it is not sysfs-ified yet.  So basically the initramfs idea
is fully plausible if initramfs will get there (or I get time to have
a look).
