Rather ugly. In my experience all vmlinux.lds hacks are very fragile
and they break when you just look at them in the wrong way. Also when
something goes wrong they are a bitch to debug. And binutils is not
exactly known for not introducing bugs with new releases.
Can't you work around that gcc 2.95 bug in some other way ?
