IMHO you need
	-	An understanding of ATA (which is the protocol
		equivalent of object oriented cobol)
	-	The ability to work with vendors (it needs to be someone
		at a company because many vendors won't NDA with 
		individuals even if they are happy with GPL code off 
		their data sheet)
	-	Someone who has taste in code and understands how to
		beat code into shape without breaking it
	-	The ability to deduce the other errata the vendor forgot
		to tell you about or doesn't want to admit exists for 
		fear of US lawsuits (I kid you not)
	-	A good understanding of the block layer and its locking
		especially because IDE has a heirarchy of contention 
		problems:
			two drives one bus
			two channels one DMA engine
			two controllers one I/O at a time
			ISA IRQ sharing locks
