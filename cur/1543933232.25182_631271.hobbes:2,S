I don't really like this approach. Whether MMCONFIG works or not has 
nothing to do with the device itself, it's an attribute of the machine, 
and possibly the bus it's been plugged into. This patch might prevent 
problems in some cases, but it's equally likely to just delay problems 
until somebody plugs in a device that tries to use extended config 
space. Neither do I really like the approach of limiting MMCONFIG 
accesses to ones beyond a certain address in the config space, for a 
similar reason.
The detection of whether MMCONFIG works or not has to work properly (and 
I think we're pretty close, or at least we know what we need to do to 
get there, like fixing the stupid MMCONFIG/PCI bar sizing overlap 
problem, and likely Tony Camuso's patch or something like it, to disable 
MMCONFIG accesses to devices behind certain broken host bridges). Once 
that works, then this patch really serves no purpose.
