Cachable memory area is a function of cache size, tag size and cache
mode (wb or wt - first needs dirty tag, second doesn't). With VIA MVP3
boards for example, cachable memory depends on the size of the cache.
Which is why most of the boards with this chipset had 1 MB level 2 cache
(enough for 128 mb with writeback or 256 mb with writethrough), some
even had 2 MB (for twice that).
