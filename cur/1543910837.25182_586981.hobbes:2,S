I don't expect any performance improvements with cmpxchg() over irq
disable/restore. I think we'll have to use cmpxchg_local
Also, we may argue that locked cmpxchg will have more scalability impact
than cmpxchg_local. Actually, I expect the LOCK prefix to have a bigger
scalability impact than the irq save/restore pair.

The minor issue I see here is on architectures where we have to simulate
cmpxchg_local with irq save/restore. Depending on how we implement the
code, it may result in two irq save/restore pairs instead of one, which
could make the code slower. However, if we are clever enough in our
low-level primitive usage, I think we could make the code use
cmpxchg_local when available and fall back on only _one_ irq disabled
section surrounding the whole code for other architectures.
