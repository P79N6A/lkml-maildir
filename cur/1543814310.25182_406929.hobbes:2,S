Each VCPU gets a private data area at the same linear address. The VMM 
constructs private page table shadows for each VCPU, and the shadows magically 
contain the right mappings for that VCPU's private data area.
Other hypervisor implementations (especially those that don't make use of shadow 
page tables) would have to come up with something along the lines that you're 
suggesting.
