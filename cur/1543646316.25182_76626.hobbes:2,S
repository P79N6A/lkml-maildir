Have you checked the settings in the adaptor's own BIOS?  Most, (all?), Adaptec cards let you change things like disconnect, and sync negotiation, etc, etc, on a per device basis.  Just press control-A, to run the SCSI-Select utility at boot up.
Also, do you have the latest firmware for your card?  If it is a genuine Adaptec card, _not_ an OEM one, then I believe that they will send you a new BIOS for it.
