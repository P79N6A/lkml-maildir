I couldn't care less if libscg works for ATAPI tapes. No-one provided
input for ATAPI tapes that do verify-while-write (call it read after
write if you want, Hinterbandkontrolle in German) yet, and potential
libscg-can't-get-a-hold-of-ATAPI-tapes problems can be discussed in a
separate thread if you don't mind.
