To me, no.  I do not know anything about IDE.  :)
I thought we were talking about SCSI PCI drivers here.

Nothing.  It is the same problem for IDE PCI drivers.  In order for PCI
Hotplug to work on these devices, they have to implement the 2.4 pci
interface.  If they do that, they work with PCI hotplug systems.  If
they do not, they don't.
