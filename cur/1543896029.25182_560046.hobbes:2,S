Datasheets typically give you one way to process the data, that doesn't
mean this is the only way, nor the best in all situations. My proposal
was mathematically equivalent to your datasheet-based implementation,
and had a lower memory footprint.
Anyway, your way works too, so it's OK. I'll take your patch as is,
optimizations can always be applied later. I wish I could give a try to
your driver, but unfortunately I still didn't manage to get my TAOS
evaluation module to work under Linux :(
