But wait, what am I thinking?  Am I sliding down the 
slipperly slope of crime so quickly?  This is how Osama
Bin Laden got started you know: with a pirated copy of

I think what I'll do is send out a GPL.  I've been told
it's a destroyer of intellectual property, so maybe it
will erase your memory that they have seen these messages.
