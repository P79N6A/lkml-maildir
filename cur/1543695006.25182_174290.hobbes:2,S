But what about 2.4.22? I am having a leak there, my size-2048 value
is always going up. As mentioned earlier this seems to happen
everytime igmpv3_newpack() gets called and allocates 1529 bytes.
I took igmpv3_newpack() from 2.6.0-test8, had to made some changes
        {
                struct rt_key key = {};
                key.dst = IGMPV3_ALL_MCR;
                key.oif = dev->ifindex;
                if (ip_route_output_key(&rt, &key)) {
                        kfree_skb(skb);
                        return 0;
                }
        }
since there is no struct flowi in 2.4.x. Don't know if the above is
correct, but the leak is still there.
The size-2048 values always go up when we receive data via a DVB card from
multiple multicast streams. Depending on the amount of memory the system
has, they always hangup after a certain time.
What else can I do find the leak?
Please help.
Thanks,
Holger
