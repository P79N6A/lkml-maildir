ok, will put it into ipwireless, and the _cs suffix will go away as suggested 
elsewhere. The filenames will then get very generic names, do you have 
suggestion for better names? There are many drivers in own directory and 
files inside have the same prefix. Maybe we can use names like ipw-hw.c, etc.
