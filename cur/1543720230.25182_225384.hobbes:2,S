Subject: [OT] Who has record no. of  DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest errors?

Well since 2.6.3 I think I've been getting the record number of 
hdd: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hdd: status error: error=0x00
hdd: drive not ready for command
hdd: ATAPI reset complete
errors from my cdrw on hdd; and it's only one drive's worth.
dmesg -s 32768 | grep DataRequest | wc -l
88
Note the -s 32768 is because my dmesg is so long due to the massive number of 
seekcomplete errors :-)
Since the cdrw works fine after re-enabling dma I never really bothered to do 
anything about it, but I'm just curious if anyone has a higher record ;-)
