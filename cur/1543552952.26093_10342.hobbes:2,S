i found that this is not a requirement for good network scalability. We do
not do a syscall for every packet, so the cost evens out. Sure, it does
not hurt to not eat ~1 microsecond per system-call, but it causes no
overhead or scalability limit otherwise. In the TUX webserver we have
user-space modules doing context-switch-less webserving, and it scales
quite well, and is generic.
