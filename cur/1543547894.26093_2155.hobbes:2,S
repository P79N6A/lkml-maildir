Yes, you've put your finger on it.  When you take a power saw and try
to use it like a chisel, it doesn't work very well.  If you are
philosophically opposed to power saws, you may pick one up, try to use
it as a chisel, and then claim that it is a very poor tool.
This is what is happening here.  The proponents of the 'withhold the
power tools' camp have fixated on the idea of using a debugger to
chisel away at a problem.  This is a poor way to use a debugger. 
Instead, use the debugger to cut a large problem space into small
pieces - pieces that are too small for a bug to hide in.  Use the
debugger as a power saw, not as a chisel, and you will have more
respect for its capabilities.
