somewhere else in the thread someone indicated this was a hard thing to
do.
also you don't need the task struct at the top to do this -- you just
allocate 16k instead of 8k, put the task struct on page 0 of the
allocation, unmap page 1, and put the stack frame on pages 2 and 3.
(you'd probably have to do a 16k allocation regardless to get the guard
page.)
