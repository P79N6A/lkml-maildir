Oh, please! All we need is sysctlbyname(2) - _not_ a problem, and closes
all problems with numbers. And it should not work through mounted procfs -
we can traverse the tree doing comparisons by name just fine. The fact
that sysctl(8) needs mounted procfs is an artificial misfeature, nothing
more.
What _is_ bogus is the idea of sysctl() doing more than read/write access
to constant-sized variables. Or procfs entries doing ioctl(), for that
matter - just look at /proc/mtrr, for one specimen.
sysctl() is a perfectly reasonable subset of pseudofs-type stuff, with
well-defined semantics (unlike the rest ;-/). The rest is pretty much a
maze of twisted little formats, none alike. IMO dissolving the thing is
_not_ a good idea. You have the final word, indeed, but I think that
sysctlbyname() may remove most of the problems.
