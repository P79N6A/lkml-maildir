Subject: [Suspend2][ 02/32] [Suspend2] Block io c file header.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/26/435

kernel/power/suspend_block_io.c does all the hard work of getting the data
written to storage via bio routines. The swapwriter and filewriter are
really only allocators - this file implements completely asynchronous
submission of the I/O and cleanup on completion. All the writers need to do
is feed a list of bdevs and blocks on each bdev, and then the pages to be
written or read.
The io_info struct stores the data on each page in flight. As pages
progress through processing, their io_info structs move from the free list
to the submit_batch list if being batched, to the busy list when submitted
to the block layer, to the ready_for_cleanup list with the completion
function is called, to the free list after cleanup. Each list has its own
spinlock to reduce locking issues.
Readahead pages are used like a ring buffer.
The posn_save struct is used to record where the three parts of the image
begin, thereby allowing quick 'seeking' to the start of a pageset or the
start of the header.
