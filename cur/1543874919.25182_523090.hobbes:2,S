Ding! A drive fell out the other day, which is why the problems only
appeared recently.
md5 : active raid5 sdf4[5] sdd4[3] sdc4[2] sdb4[1] sda4[0]
      1719155200 blocks level 5, 64k chunk, algorithm 2 [6/5] [UUUU_U]
      bitmap: 149/164 pages [596KB], 1024KB chunk
H'm... this means that my alarm scripts aren't working.  Well, that's
good to know.  The drive is being re-integrated now.
