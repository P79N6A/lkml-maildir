It sucks. Forget about NFS-exporting FAT, then.

They are.

No, they cannot. Many filesystems rely on that *not* happening. Do it and
you broke a lot of namespace-related code. IOW, forget it. Please, leave
directories out of it. That kind of mess is the last thing we need right
now - tons of new races over the whole namespace code.

You *do* know how badly POSIX locks implementation sucks, right? Relying
on it will kill any performance.

Too fine grained. You are adding the unneeded overhead.
