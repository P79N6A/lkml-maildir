Except, if you read the comment, we never do APM BIOS calls on anything
but CPU 0.  On SMP the only APM BIOS operation we allow is power off
and we have code to ensure we are on CPU 0 before we do that ...

I would prefer a patch (see the post by Muli Ben-Yehuda
<mulix@actcom.co.il>) that defines num_possible_cpus() or equivalent, the
current code (using num_online_cpus()) is broken in places.
I need to revisit all this code in light of CPU hotplug ...
