They are useful, even if they are more or less a snapshot in time, as it
at least gives people a vague idea of whats going on.  So instead of
having to e-mail the admins and ask 'my download is slow' they can at
least glance at the graphs and possibly realize OHHHH it's release day
and kernel.org is moving close to 2gbps between the two machines.

Considering how many times the front page of kernel.org is viewed, yes
they are cached and sitting in ram on the kernel.org boxes.
Realistically - we are arguing over something that barely even registers
as a blip within the entirety of the load on kernel.org, and we have
bigger things to worry about than a restructuring of our front page when
it won't greatly affect our loads.
