	Oops. Operator precedence strikes again. They are in

	The frequency with which root/cwd dentries are in any given path 
	probably cause the majority of the cacheline bouncing of d_count.
	So the logic there is clear. However, you make a good point and
	I'm looking at this.

	The first reaction I have is that it breaks the consistancy 
	between a flag and what the flag represents. Having the dcache_lock
	held without the LOOKUP_LOCKED flag in this part of the code might
	cause deadlocks or lead to hard-to-maintain code. 
	I appreciate you taking the time to provide such thoughtful and
	deatailed comments and I will look at the whole patch again with 
	these comments in mind. Next week expect a new and improved
	version!
	Thanks.
	Hanna
