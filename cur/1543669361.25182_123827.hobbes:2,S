Sure.  I don't think your emacs will be a problem - you aren't typing
in it while playing half-life? :-)   And if you're multi-user - the other
user with his emacs has as much right to the cpu as your half-life game.

I'm not sure I agree on that - see below.

I agree that it isn't fundamentally insane, but using the 2.5.66
mechanism might force you to
concider some apps "broken" that were fine before.  This forces the
question of how hard it should be to write a user program.
100 screen updates per second doesn't mean it is important if it only
is twiddling of a baton or some progress bar.  People simply stick such
things in an outer loop - and that worked out to a update or two
per second in 1989.  Same code on todays machines results in hundreds
of updates per second.  Are we going to fix apps as our pcs becomes faster?
Cpu speed independent animations/screen updates are indeed possible, 
something
every game writer has to deal with.  But do we want to force people to do
that only so their progress bar won't go over some update treshold and
become an "interactive cpu hog" on some future fast machine?
