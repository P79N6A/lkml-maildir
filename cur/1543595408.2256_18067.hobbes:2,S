Hi,
I couls see 
http://kgdb.sourceforge.net/
 the kgdb for 2.4.5 kernel
version. Can I use the same for 2.2.14 kernel which I am using? If so how
can I use gdb.bz2 downloaded file. I have this downloaded to my windows
machine and have ftp ed to my linux machine to my home directory. Please
tell me how I should go about it.
Thanks in advance,
Regards,
sathish.j
