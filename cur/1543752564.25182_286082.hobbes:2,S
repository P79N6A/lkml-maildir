Do you know what polynomial you are trying to use? My first try wth Google 
gets me to:
http://www.cyphercalc.com/crctool.htm#LookupTables
not to mention a bunch of free sources such as:
http://www.repairfaq.org/filipg/LINK/F_crc_v35.html
which even implies that the pkzip polynomial *is* the standard one. If you 
really need the unrolled version for performance, at least use the right data 
types and/or consider to compute the tables at run time:
