sounds like about disk speed (at random-seek IO pattern)

before you go there... is this a "real life" problem? Or just a
mostly-artificial corner case? (the answer to that obviously is
relevant for the 'should we really care' question)
Another question, if this is during system shutdown, maybe that's a
valid case for flushing most of the pagecache first (from userspace)
since most of what's there won't be used again anyway. If that's enough
to make this go faster...
A third question, have you investigated what happens if a process gets
killed that has pages in swap; as long as we don't page those in but
just forget about them, that would solve the shutdown problem nicely
(since we kill stuff first anyway there)
