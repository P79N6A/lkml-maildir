I don't really understand how this should deal with drivers that have
both generic and private ioctl conversion handlers. E.g. 
drivers/s390/block/dasd*.c want to go through the handlers in 
fs/compat_ioctl.c for stuff like BLKGETSIZE, while it also allows
third party modules to dynamically register additional ioctls.
See drivers/s390/block/dasd_cmb.c for an example, I think EMC are
doing something similar to support their drives.
If the dasd driver now implements an ioctl_compat() method, who will
call the standard conversion handlers?
