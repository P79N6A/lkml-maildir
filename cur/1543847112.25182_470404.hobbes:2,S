It doesn't have the colorful history of pt_regs, but the 'irq' argument 
is dead weight.  I'd say the wrongness stems from its utter uselessness.
Out of ~1100 irq handlers, the irq parameter is used in ~50.  The vast 
majority of those 50 uses are debug printks, or abused as a "did I call 
myself?" internal driver flag.  The number of "real" uses is under 15, 
and those are all ancient ISA or platform drivers that pre-date my ~10 
year history with Linux.
So, I don't see any convincing argument to keep it.  And if we are going 
to kill it, given the pt_regs churn, this is probably the best 
opportunity we'll have in years.
Another weak-but-still-present argument in favor of killing it is that 
this change would IMO future-proof irq handlers, against more exotic irq 
handling methods that may come down the pipe.
