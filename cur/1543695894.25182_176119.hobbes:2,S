This is adapted from RealTek's latest 1.6 driver. The current
in-kernel version is marked as 1.2.  This version includes the
necessary changes to be compiled for the 2.6 kernel.  This
is the only driver known to work for the 8110S chip on many
Opteron/Athlon64 mobos.
This has been tested on UP and SMP machines.
