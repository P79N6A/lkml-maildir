 Actually, I got confused ... I forgot that you have to connect() to
/dev/log and can't just open() it[1] ... so just having open_r and
open_w separated would be enough. Which you'll hopefully agree would
be nice to have outside of SELinux policy (noting that SELinux doesn't
let you limit open calls, as such, only read+write -- although it's
mostly the same).
[1] Although, if we ever fix open... :)
