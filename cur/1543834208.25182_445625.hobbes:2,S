they provided a driver for it and I am working on cleaning it up and
getting it merged mainline, but this hasn't been finished now. However I
am using this card for quite some time now with Linux. You can download
my current driver version with this command:
	cg-clone 
http://git.holtmann.org/nozomi.git
I broke the latest revision with a change that produces a NULL pointer
dereference and haven't had the time to fix it. Will take a look at it
once I am back from the OLS.
Regards
Marcel
