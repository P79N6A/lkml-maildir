If the clock is speeding up due to spurious extra timer interrupts,
how about reading the timer chip to validate the interrupts?  Doesn't
sound unreasonable to me :)
The problem with using the tsc is that the tsc frequency isn't
constant on some systems.  If it slows down, it would make valid timer
interrupts appear to be spurious.
