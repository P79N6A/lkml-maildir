Well, actually, it looks right to me: It says to build the .ver file, we
need the header (since it'll be included during the process).
It looks somewhat ugly, but I think it's one of the very few places where
something like this is needed.  Of course, if there was a way to tell make
"$(MODVERDIR)/%.ver has the same prequisites as %.o" that'd be nicer, but
there isn't AFAICT.
Another possibility would be to record these kind of explicit dependencies 
on generated files into variables, so Rules.make could do the right thing.
Something like
	53c700.o-needs := 53c700_d.h
But I'm not sure that's so much nicer.
