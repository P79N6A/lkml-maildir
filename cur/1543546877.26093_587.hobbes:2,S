I agree.  I don't think Pthreads spec intended to prescribe behavior, only
to allow it, and I think that this is allowable - if documented - behavior.
It seems to me that it is a reasonable compromise between general signal
delivery  performance and pthread requirements.
On the other hand, I think that using signals, even posix signals, as a
thread level IPC mechanism shows a certain lack of taste (to follow the
nomenclature of this discussion so far.)

In my humble opinion, it's correct here to take advantage of the POSIX
distinction between thread identifier and pid.  That is, a signal sent to
the pid of the root process is a signal sent to the threaded process, but
kill(pidx,n) where pidx is the processid of a thread should be
equivalent to pthread_kill(pidx,n). That is, if you use the pid of a
thread, you are specifying the thread, not the thread-group (process).
The introduction of the variable resources forks was key to coming up
with any solution.
