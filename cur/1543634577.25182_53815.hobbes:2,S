Nothing wrong with that.  I may be wrong, but I have the impression
that the bp6 was quite popular for a while.  It was the only
cheap smp board for a while (excluding those who re-soldered
their cpu's to enable SMP in other boards) 
and it took some time before people realized that a good
PSU and extra cooling wasn't enough.

My impression is that the IDE driver contains workarounds for many
broken chipsets.  Using DMA is usually
default off but can be turned on for those that know it
won't hurt in their case.
I think a similiar approach is ok with the BP6 fix - put it in
because there are a bunch of these boards, default it OFF because
many more don't need it.
