Tried: nothing changed. For the TI1131 only the bridge windows are lost,
not resource 0. It's still there and appears valid to the kernels best
knowledge - no need for re-negotiation.

I've just hacked down the pci resource allocation (namely pci-i386.c) in
such a way to always assign insane 0xe6000/0xe7000 to the base resource 0
(register memory) similar to what the BIOS does. Same result: working
until suspend, identical RO garbage thereafter. Seems it's really a bad
choice to map PCI memory to this area - at least for this box.

sounds reasonable wrt what I've seen - Don't trust the BIOS.

Should work - identify all (bad mapped) regions, free them, and let
pci_enable_device() make things fine. However, I'd suggest doing this at
initial pci device scan since
- not only cardbus devices might be misconfigured by the BIOS
- no need for sanity check in every pci-capable driver.
- similar stuff needed for transparent hotplugging
Loosing part of this later at suspend is a different issue which may
deserve fixing at per-driver basis. But broken PCI memory mapping to BIOS
legacy area should be corrected from the very beginning, I believe.
