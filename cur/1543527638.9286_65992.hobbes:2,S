ne.c is broken in 2.3.47.
ne.o requires 8390.o.
drivers/net/Makefile has been changed so that even if CONFIG_NE2000=m,
8390.o is linked direct into the kernel.  But 8390.o does not export its
symbols when it isn't compiled as a module.
Consequently ne.o won't load into the 8390.o-containing kernel - it
cannot resolve its references into 8390.o.
A workaround is to make 8390.o always export its symbols, however I
don't think it was intentional that 8390.o be non-modularised in this
manner.
Bottom lines:
- I think there's a Makefile bug: 8390.o should remain a module if ne.o
is a module.
- I suggest that 8390.o should always export its symbols so one can have
modular ne.o and static 8390.o.  Or would this break something?
