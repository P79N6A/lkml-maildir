No. Used symlinks, which, with devfsd, BTW, are persistent.

Jeezo cheeso, buddy, are you ignoring the major/minor limitation thing here,
or what???

You've lost me.

What you had before was limited, and not sustainable.

You can chmod/chown/ln in the devfs, and it's persistent.

Then you are ignoring the arguments for it.

Now you've abstracted everything to a way beyond level. You want your OS to
use URLs??? Why don't you KISS yourself! I mean, you just blasted devfs for
being too complex!!! Have you EVER used it? Did you even read the FAQ?
