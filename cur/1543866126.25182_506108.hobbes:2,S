    JFS: Remove incorrect kgdb define
    
    jfs_debug.h uses an incorrect CONFIG_KERNEL_ASSERT ifdef to redefine the
    assert macro for kgdb use.  I believe the code worked a long time ago, but
    today it's not a valid config option.  Since I'm not aware of anybody
    interested in debugging jfs with kgdb, it should just be removed.
    
    Thanks to Robert P. J. Day for reporting this.

    JFS: call io_schedule() instead of schedule() to avoid deadlock
    
    The introduction of Jens Axboe's explicit i/o plugging patches introduced a
    deadlock in jfs.  This was caused by the process initiating I/O not
    unplugging the queue before waiting on the commit thread.  The commit
    thread itself was waiting for that I/O to complete.  Calling io_schedule()
    rather than schedule() unplugs the I/O queue avoiding the deadlock, and it
    appears to be the right function to call in any case.

    JFS should mark the superblock dirty and return an error rather than
    calling BUG().
