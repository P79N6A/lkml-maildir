Hmmm ... I am not sure that a smiley was appropriate in your reply.
AFAIR, until somebody, you hopefully know very well, changed the PCI code,
IRQ numbers were correctly reported in _decimal_ by pci.c.
You should fix immediately oldproc.c rather than smiling at the face of
17% of the OS market that probably expects 2.2 kernels to provide
compatibibility with applications based on 2.0 kernels, IMO. :-)) 
Happy New Year!
