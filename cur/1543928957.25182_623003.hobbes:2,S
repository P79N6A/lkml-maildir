Nah, it does what it's supposed to. Really, the only information in the
uaddr[] array is the information about what widths are supported, and
the _first_ unlock address is the only one we should care about.
It should change to a bitmask for the widths which are supported, and a
single int for the uaddr.

That is basically the assertion being made, yes. And it's true -- which
is why I didn't want you removing it ;)

No, you need to use the second row because the first row is incorrect.
It ought to contain what's in the second row. :)
