Indeed, you have made the best point to date.  The faceless nature of
email allows one to have more vibrato than in a face to face.  The general
lack of personal socail skills of masses to date, is a direct result of
CRT over exposure.....this is regardless of the content being displayed.
Thus, an apology is extened to "Jeff V. Merkey" for my rip against him
last night in the general defense of "Linux".
