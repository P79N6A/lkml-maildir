Scenario 3.
Finished touching up todays report.
"Save As" blahblah.doc
blahblah.doc is a random-access BLOB library managed in userspace by a
standard collection of subroutines.  Lucky me:  we chose an open-source
wordprocessor and helped port it to the BLOB-library package.  "Save as"
takes 12ms because the text BLOB is minuscule.
Open mailer.  "Attach File" blahblah.doc.  Works.
Convert blahblah.doc -> blahblah.rtf.  Return to mailer while converter
is running; read a couple of notes. "To: P.H.B. Worduser".  "Attach File
blahblah.rtf".  Works.  rm blahblah.rtf .
cp blahblah.doc ~/backups .  Works.
Go home and watch The Simpsons.

A Brazil-nut is neatly packaged and tightly integrated.  To turn it into
food, you must crack and remove the shell.  I find that I feel the same   
way about an increasing number of software products.  *sigh*
