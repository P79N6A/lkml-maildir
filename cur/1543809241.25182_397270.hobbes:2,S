Michael, now I'm not sure whether this will work for devices like the
Mellanox PCI-X HCA, where the HCA device sits below a virtual PCI
bridge.  In that case we need to propagate the NO_MSI flag from the
8131 bridge to the Tavor bridge, right?  And it has to work for
systems like Sun V40Z where the PCI-X slots are hot-swappable (so the
HCA and its bridge could be added later).
