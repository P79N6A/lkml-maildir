The fact that there are no in-tree modules that use init_mm is rather 
compelling evidence that it's not a necessary part of the kernel module 
API.  Nvidia needs to fix their code.  If this is a burden, perhaps they 
should publish their code under a GPLv2-compatible license so we can 
show them how to do it.
