Three times now I've had 2.4.3 freeze on my dual CPU box while doing a
"dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hdc bs=1024k" (a drive to be RMA'd :)).  I got
bored and opened an rxvt, and as the machine was swapping in (I assume),
everything froze.  The mouse still moved for about 5 seconds before the
freeze, and the window was visible as it was attempting to start tcsh.
I'm guessing that what's happening is something is waiting on a lock and
blocking interrupts (?) for five seconds while it is swapping in, and the
NMI lockup detector is kicking in and really breaking it.
I have my serial console plugged in and minicom actually capturing now,
so I'll see if I can get a trace of some sort.
