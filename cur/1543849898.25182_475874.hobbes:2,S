There's nothing wrong with that; lots of devices don't have the means to 
prevent media removal.  The proper response is "Invalid Command", not "End 
of Data".  If the device sent the proper reply you wouldn't get all those 
"Hardware error, end-of-data detected" messages in the log.

Were all the slots empty?  If yes, the reader should not have indicated a
card was present in that slot.  If no, the reader should have returned the
data from the card instead of a phase error.  Either way, it misbehaved.

Linux did not crash because of the bad reader; it crashed because of an 
unrelated bug in ehci-hcd.  (Although it's possible that the bug was 
triggered by the error-recovery for the bad reader.)
