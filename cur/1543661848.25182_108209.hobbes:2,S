There is definitely something after that patch.  gdb is broken in ways that
are being mysterious to me, and now zombies with ppid 1 are sticking around
forever.  With that patch, do:
  bash$ (sleep 2 & echo zombie $! ; exec sleep 10000000) & sleep 4; kill -9 $!
  [2] 1220
  zombie 1222
  bash$ ps l1222
  [2]+  Killed                  ( sleep 2 & echo zombie $!; exec sleep 10000000 )
  F   UID   PID  PPID PRI  NI   VSZ  RSS WCHAN  STAT TTY        TIME COMMAND
  0  5281  1222     1  15   0     0    0 wait4  Z    pts/1      0:00 [sleep <defun
Such zombies seem to stick around forever.  I must have managed to break
the normal delivery of SIGCHLD to init, but right now it's a mystery to me how.
