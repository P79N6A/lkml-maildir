Hi Markus,
Thank you very much for finding new bugs ;-) Actually, right now I've 
just moved and don't have internet at home which is kind of slowing down 
development... Anyway, I'll check if I have some more fixes on my 
computer than on my website. Also, it would be good to double check some 
lines which I've commented XXX. In particular, IIRC there were some 
suspicious sleep saying it was sleeping a microsecond and sleeping one 
millisecond!
I'm also a bit concerned about the userspace "driver" for pscd which 
comes with the original driver once the patch will be part of the 
default kernel. Maybe this userspace part could become part of the 
pscdlite distribution.
Wrt the module having always a usecount value of 1, it was worrying me 
too at the begining until I noticed it decreased back to 0 once the card 
is "ejected" (pccardctl eject 1). Although a bit surprising, I don't 
think it's a bug, is it?
See you,
Eric
