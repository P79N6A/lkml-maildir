The header file stuff was intentionally added, as it is good to have the
header files exported properly.  Those were a large number of these
patches.
If you have specific questions about any one patch, please let us know.
I didn't purposefully take any "cleanup" type patch that I know of, but
there was a lot here, so one might have slipped in...
thanks,
