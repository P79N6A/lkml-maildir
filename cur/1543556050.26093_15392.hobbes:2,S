> can you give a rough estimate on when you suspect you started seeing it?
I reported both cases. That is, I started seeing it a few days ago.
(But there is no problem during daily work. Also for example a
diff between two kernel trees never gave corruption so far.
It was only with diff between trees several GB in size, and I
don't do that very often.)
