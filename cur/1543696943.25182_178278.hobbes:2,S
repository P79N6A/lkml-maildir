I beg your pardon?  What different arguments?
->open() gets struct inode * and struct file *
->release() gets exactly the same.
seq_release() is what you use as ->release()
What's the problem?

Of course it is not illegal.  Moreover, if you just do open() immediately
followed by close(), you won't get non-NULL ->buf at all.  It's a perfectly
normal situation and seq_release() can handle it - no problems with that.

	if (!m->private) {
		seq_release(inode, file);
		return -ENOMEM;
	}
Same as e.g. fs/proc/base.c does in similar situation (see mounts_open()).
