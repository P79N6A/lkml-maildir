Didn't work :-(
Still get the message in our Subject!
I even changed some of my NIC's io's to seemingly no avail.
The one line that is _NOT_ changing for me in conf.modules,
and may be the culprit, is the 'options sscape' line!!!
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
sndconfig for me under RH 5.2 (whatever kernel) doesn't
alter this line.  Wonder why? What (re)configures the options
for 'sscape'?? -Thanks
Jeff
