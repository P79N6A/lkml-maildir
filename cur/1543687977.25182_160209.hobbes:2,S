Of course.  It's not unusual for a game to have a "define keys"
option, where you press a key for each action, to set the key
bindings.  Sometimes you pick mnemonic keys; other times, you pick
keys because of how their position feels, like making a custom joypad.
On my Microsoft multimedia keyboard there are about 20 keys that I
could see being useful for that, especially as mnemonic keys.

:(  That's a shame, and a peculiar bug too.  Then I agree that
forced-up is needed all the time, if we do not know what triggers the
keyboard to forget to send one or have any way to detect it.
It is not so bad, because even the multimedia keys will be fine on
good quality keyboards.

Fair enough, I agree.
