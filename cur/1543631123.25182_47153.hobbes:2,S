No. You never "need to do it". Some user-mode task, somewhere, installs
your module. That same task can open your device and via ioctl() tell
it anything it needs to know.
A "file" is something the kernel handles on behalf of a task. That
task has a context which, amongst other things, allows the kernel
to assign file-descriptors. The kernel is not a task. It does not
have a "context". Of course it can create one and it can steal one.
These are the two methods used inside the kernel to handle "files".
And, unless the kernel task "thread" is permanent, it's a dirty
way of corrupting the kernel.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
