Try passing acpi_sleep=s3_bios or acpi_sleep=s3_mode to the kernel on
boot - also try while running X, switch away before suspend and switch
back afterwards. The problem is that the kernel doesn't know how to wake
the video hardware back up after S3 - the kernel parameters are hacks
that try to provoke it back into life, and X is sometimes able to
reinitialise stuff itself.
