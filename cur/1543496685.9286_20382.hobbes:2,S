Subject: Re: [patch] releasing kernel lock during copy_from/to_user

I've modified uaccess.h, and I have now a list of all functions which
called copy_to/from_user() for more than 512 bytes (apache, make clean;
make fs; find /usr/bin)
* read_file_actor()
* ext2_file_write()
* block_read()
* copy_mount_options()	<< really rare
* proc_file_read()	<< rare??
* pipe_write()
* pipe_read()
* 2*vt_ioctl() << could be remote gdb.
* tcp_do_sendmsg()
* copy_strings()	<< only during fork()?
Additionally, the following functions should also release the kernel
lock:
* padzero() in binfmt_elf:
	This function clears up to 4096 bytes user memory.
	The average should be 2048.
* update_vm_mapping():
	the function can wait in wait_on_page(), we should break nothing
* get_free_page():
	if GFP_WAIT, for memset(,0,PAGE_SIZE)
Are you aware of other functions which could release the lock for long
operations?
I'll extract the patch from andrea5, but I'll release the lock
only in the codepath's where I have seen > 512 bytes.
A compile-time check is faster than the shortest runtime check:>
I'll post benchmarks later.
