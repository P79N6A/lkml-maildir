Hi Eric,
	Patches look reasonable, but just a heads-up: lguest will be moving to
virtio, as will kvm.  That means a single implementation for both
(yay!), but it does complicate your life in the short term 8(
	Dor has published a kvm virtio implementation, and we've already
discussed a couple of modifications.  I expect that to be nailed in the
next 2 weeks tho, and lguest will follow.
Thanks!
Rusty.
