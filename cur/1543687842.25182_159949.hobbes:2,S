The via rhine driver fails to get a dhcp address on my test system on 
2.6.0-test4.   ethereal shows no dhcp request leaving the box but 
ifconfig does show the device and it is detected in /proc/pci.   
Switching from the test3 vs.  test4 snapshots built with equivalent 
configure options on the same system (SuSE 8.2) - test3 works but test4 
does not.   This is using essentially the default config for both the 
test3 and test4 cases - the only changes are SMP disabled, scsi devices 
disabled, Athlon, via-rhine enabled in network devices and a handful of 
additional filesystems enabled, debug memory allocations enabled.   This 
is the first time in many months that I have seen problems with the 
via-rhine driver on 2.6
Analyzing the code differences between 2.6.0-test3 and test4 (in 
via-rhine.c) is not very promising since the only line that has changed 
(kfree to free_netdev) is in the routine via_rhine_remove_one that seems 
unlikely to cause problems sending data on the network.
Ideas as to what could have caused the regression?
