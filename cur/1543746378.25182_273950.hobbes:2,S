There is good and bad news related to 2.6.10-rc2
The good news is that the acpi problem was the cause of the startup issues.  
adding pci=noacpi to the boot command line fixed that.
The bad news is that with the delay at 800ns in drive_is_ready() I am getting 
the exact same symptoms I got with 2.6.9 before upping the delay to over 
540ns.
Before, I thought my hardware was a little out of spec - now I think there is 
something else at play here.
Firstly, the symptoms are the same between 2.6.9 and 2.6.10-rc2.  The halt 
seem to always be in exactly the same place. If it was a timing problem I 
would have thought it would have varied.
Secondly, the command before seems to have an expectation of a 2048 transfer 
rather than the 0 in the command, before the problem and then you get the 
strange DRQ=1 but 0 in the len register.

I have got myself a copy of the ATA/ATAPI spec (document T13/1410D revision 
3), I think I need to read more of it to understand what is the code is 
trying to do.
