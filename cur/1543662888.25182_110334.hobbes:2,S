Wrong.

310 U.K. pounds plus V.A.T.
This is, quoting directly from the webpage:
an "all you can eat" service, allowing you as much bandwidth as you
can get 24 hours a day. 
Please note - my only connection with Andrews & Arnold is as a happy
customer, and I do not subscribe to that particular service, because I
do not require such a high bandwidth allowance, since grabjohn.com is
served from a 10 Mbps connection in London's Docklands.
