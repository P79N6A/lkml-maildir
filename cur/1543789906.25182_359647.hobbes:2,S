The technical stuff got covered long ago.  Here are the basic basics:
* aic94xx needs to have the scsi-host-template in the LLDD, to fix 
improper layering.
* SAS generic code needs to use SAS transport class, which calls 
scsi_scan_target(), to avoid code duplication.
* other stuff I listed in my "analysis" email, including updating libata 
to support SAS+SATA hardware.
This is the stuff that I have been working on (nothing pushed to sas-2.6 
yet, as it doesn't yet boot locally).
If you were willing to do this stuff, _working with others_, then I 
would be off in happy happy SATA land right now, and you would have been 
nominated to be the Linux SAS maintainer.
Call it FUD, politics, personal attacks, wanking off to please 
manglement, whatever.  My goal has always been to (a) help Linux users 
by getting aic94xx+SAS upstream, and (b) try to help you understand why 
your code didn't go upstream verbatim, long after others have given up 
trying to do that.
	Jeff, he of infinite patience
