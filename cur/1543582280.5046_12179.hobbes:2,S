I know this option is tagged by Rusty as experimental still so I would assume that the code is open for feedback ;) The question could be rephrased as: is there any chance of allowing "invalid" mac addresses to be recognized by the --mac-source option of the netfilter code? Running Redhat v7/kernel 2.4.1-ac15.

Good question. I have determined by scanning my firewall logs that the "invalid" mac addresses are all coming from cable modem routers. And my linux kernel is recognizing them as being MAC addresses. Would it be better to write another module looking for these long "MAC"  rather than tamper with the mac module? 
To illustrate, here is a cut from my system log showing a portscan from my cable modem provider (a routine part of their service contract since you are not allowed to run client-side servers). SRC and DST have been x'ed out:

All hits on my firewall from cable modem servers other than my own provider also have the 14 group "MAC" address so it looks like this may be a feature of these units.
