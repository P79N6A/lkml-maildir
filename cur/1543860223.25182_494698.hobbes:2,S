Guys, you _really_ should fix memset(). What you describe is a _bug_. 
"memset()" takes an "int" as its argument (always has), and has to convert 
it to a byte _itself_. It may not be common, but it's perfectly normal, to 
pass it values outside 0-255 (negative values that still fit in a "signed 
char" in particular are very normal, but my usage of "let the thing 
truncate it itself" is also quite fine).

No. I'm almost certain that that is not a "fix", it's a workaround for a 
serious bug in your glibc crap.
But it does explain all the unexpected strange behaviour (and the really 
small writeback size - now it doesn't need any /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio 
assumptions to be explicable.
