Alright, good to know.  If I may suggest:
99% of my changes are to text Docs, not source.  I don't believe we would be risking code breakage as a result of merging them.  In this case of course I don't expect you to root through the trivial box and pull out my patches, but maybe this isn't the best way for me to submit them in the first place?  It seems like a particularly small and unnecessary window for somebody to update text files in.  Is there a different tree or maintainer that would be better suited for this type of thing?
Thanks again.
