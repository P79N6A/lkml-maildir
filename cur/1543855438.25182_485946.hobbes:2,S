I don't know for sure, but it's probably around the 150 LOC mark from 
about 12 patches, mainly in page_alloc.c. A significant portion of the 
patches were documentation, comments and providing debugging information. 
As it is, any bug fix or improvement in that code will now apply to all 
architectures using the API, not just one.
I expect the net code difference to drop as some of the mem= parsing 
(which currently does not always work AFAIK) gets handled in generic 
rather than arch-specific code. These type of cleanups will take a while. 
I would also expect the net difference to drop if more architectures used 
the API instead of arch-specific code but I couldn't test on all arches.

The worst of the noise should be over now. The last patch I sent isn't 
necessary. I only sent it on because it would have cut down on the time 
needed to fix Andre's issue.
