well, I just got on line again and the byte counter spins and will
defnitelky cost money (access is metered here).
basically, all denied/rejected mailk will get a standard mail from my system
which is sent to postmaster (me) also. I always give peple a chance to
'prove' that their address is OK. Some homtmail accts, some freemail accts
etc all are OK but most of them are rejected.
of all mails I receive from such sites, in the last year I use the access
database, I have found _only_ 12 people that actually don't send spam.
all others (counting several hundreds) were simply sending spam.
the time I write this, rhw@bigfoot.com will have the mail in his queue. I
assume that, since he writes here, that his address ok to keep in the
database as being OK.
