I have put two guys to working full-time on VFS cleanup.
I understand that getting rid of iget is being discussed as part of improving
knfsd.  So happy to see it go....
Currently having to find files by something other than a dentry or a filename
(or a key) uglifies our design.  Even the use of a 64 bit number forces us to
use fixed length keys which forces us to use hashing which by destroying sorting
makes it impossible to use stem compression in our directories.  (This affects
one of our web search engine sponsors who would like for 30 million entry
directories to fit into RAM in our next major version of reiserfs.) If knfsd
goes to using dentries to talk to reiserfs, we will be very happy.
Thanks much,
Hans
