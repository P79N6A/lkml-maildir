Hi All,
I have been using 2.6.10 until now and moving over 2.6.18.
And I trying to build a 2.6.18 kernel for a PowerPC 405GP.
I discovered that there is a .dts file needed by the kernel.
I have no idea how to customize this file. Any tips, suggestions or
Documentation that I can look at?
I am using u-boot as my board's FW.
Also, I have a Walnut like board for which I am building the kernel.
Appreciate your help in this issue.
Thanks,
Sreen
