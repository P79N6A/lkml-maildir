Which suspend version are you using?  echo -n "4">/proc/acpi/something or echo 
-n "disk" > sys/power/state?
The second works for me (for a slightly malleable value of "works": resume has 
never failed on me, suspend works maybe 9 times out of 10, and either 
immediately resumes without power down (apparently with no harm done, it just 
didn't work) or panics the rest of the time).
The first has never come close to working (for me).
