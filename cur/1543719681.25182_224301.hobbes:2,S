I saw the same problem on a PCI card with a 128MB BAR. it is triggered 
on an Tyan opteron mobo, while on a old Dell P4 mobo it is ok. I 
followed a bit the source code for ioremap and found two places in which 
it can fail,
    area = get_vm_area(size, VM_IOREMAP);
    if (!area)
        return NULL;
    addr = area->addr;
    if (remap_area_pages(VMALLOC_VMADDR(addr), phys_addr, size, flags)) {
        vfree(addr);
        return NULL;
    }
I had not time to add debug printk and recompila the kernel to check 
which one is faulty...
The strange thing is that the BARs seems to be laid out correctly, so it 
does not look like a bios bug...

we tried with half and it was ok, then we moved up a bit and found the 
maximum around 80MB I think...
