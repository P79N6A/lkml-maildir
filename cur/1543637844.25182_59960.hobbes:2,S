Mine is a direct fee payment from users with allocation of fee 
instructions accompanying the fee.  The fee is less for buyers of cheap 
computers since the hardware cost is low, so folks in Brazil on average 
pay less than folks in Silicon Valley.  The more you spend in hardware 
the more you can afford to pay/contribute for software.

Limited?  What limit?  If you  pay the X% of hardware cost fee you can 
use all the software in the pool.

You are assuming they think.  They don't.  They sense herd movement. 
 This is wise of them, because unless a large portion of the herd moves 
to it, it has no value.  Thus it has no value.  Thus the herd does not move.
