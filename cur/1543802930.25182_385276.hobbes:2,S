I still think patch 1 (delayed zeroing) is a good thing to have.  It
will definitely improve performance for multi-threaded hugetlb
applications by avoiding unnecessary hugetlb page zeroing.  It also
shrinks the race window we have been talking about to a tiny fraction of
what it was.  This should ease the problem while we figure out a way to
handle the "last free page" case.
