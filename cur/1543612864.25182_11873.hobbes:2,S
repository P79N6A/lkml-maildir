Now that Al has not yet told me what is wrong with the
device handling scheme outlined, let me do something else
instead and remove some of the backlog for util-linux.
Just released util-linux-2.11n in the usual places.
l-k relevance: blockdev has a --report option as announced
Very off-topic: FSF promotes free software, but produces
message translation files with header
 # Copyright (C) 2001 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
and without any indication that these files can be freely
modified and distributed. No GPL or anything. Very unfree.
This is the reason that there still is no up-to-date set
of French messages.
