We might want having both... Hmm... in_suspend - is it only for swsusp
(in_swsusp) or for suspend-to-ram as well? For suspend to ram we might
need slightly different rules, I don't know. A separate call will
allow more fine-grained control and will explicitely tell reader what
is happening.
I do not have a strong preference though.
