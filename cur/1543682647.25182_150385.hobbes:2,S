Correction:
  - vesafb uses
      o request_mem_region() on the linear frame buffer
      o request_region() on the 32 VGA registers (but the return code is
	ignored because of vgacon)
  - vga16fb doesn't use resource management (ugh)
  - vgacon uses
      o request_region() on the MDA/CGA/EGA/VGA registers

Vesafb may use a protected mode BIOS call instead.
An additional complexity is that not only vesafb/vga16fb may claim the VGA
registers, but also vgacon. And it's allowed for vesafb/vga16fb to take over
vgacon.
