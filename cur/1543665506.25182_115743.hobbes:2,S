Good day, all,
	For those interested in trying out a 2.5 kernel but are a little
nervous about using it on a production system, I have a precompiled UML
kernel at 
http://www.stearns.org/uml/linux-2.5.64-bk3-63um1-3.bz2
 .  Pull
down, decompress, and use with a uml root filesystem (see
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net
).  Options used are in
http://www.stearns.org/uml/config-2.5.64-bk3-63um1-3
 , System.map at
http://www.stearns.org/uml/System.map-2.5.64-bk3-63um1-3
 .
	As with any development kernel, please remember that this may very 
well corrupt data.  Please make a backup of your UML root filesystem 
before using.  The kernel _appears_ to work - no more guarantees than 
that.  :-)
	(For those interested in compiling it themselves, Jeff's
2.5.63-um1 patch plus
http://www.stearns.org/uml/linux-2.5.64-bk3-63um1-initcall.patch
 is all
that appears to be needed)
	Cheers,
	- Bill
