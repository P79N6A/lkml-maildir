None of these, but close: remove-polling-timer-from-i8042-v2.patch breaks
things here.  [FYI, the box is booted with "noapic", because the IRQ sharing
doesn't work otherwise due to a BIOS issue, so it may be related.]
Attached is the dmesg output with i8042.debug=1 for Dmitry.  It's from
2.6.18-rc3 with -mm2 partially applied (up to and including
logips2pp-fix-mx300-button-layout.patch).  I'll apply the rest tonight, after
I find the patch that broke suspend for me.
BTW, I couldn't test -rc4, because I don't use git and there's no standalone
version so far.  I hope it will be available?
[Now, I have an emergency to handle, so I won't be reachable before tonight,
I think.]
Greetings,
Rafael
