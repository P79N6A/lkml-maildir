I already have - see earlier in this thread. Interspersed output
on SMP machines gives unreadable garbage.

Of course you could. You could just take the existing mechanism
that's been written for event logging and call it printk, for one.
But the point is to *avoid* dramatic changes to the existing subsystem
to avoid the massive pain of migration (80,000 existing calls), and
an unknown number of sysadmins with scripts to parse stuff out that
you'd drive completely mad (as we did with PTX). In the first post I 
did to this thread is a the reasoning layed out for why not to change
printk.
