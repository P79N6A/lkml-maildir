Well, to be honest I didn't find any change after the modification. :)
But, anyway, Marcelo explained to me what's going on and I have
already agreed there is no need to change that. Instead I'll modify my
patch to introduce new /proc entry with meaningful name:
max_async_pages.

I can only add that I share your opinion. :)

I'll check your new patch as soon as I have investigated few more
things and got a little more acquainted with the mm code in the
2.4.0. It's a pity I found some free time this late, but then again I
see myself much more involved with the mm code in the future. It's
just that I'll need some help in the start thus so much questions on
the lists. :)
