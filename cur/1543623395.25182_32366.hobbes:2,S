There's an increase in latency.  For my application, I have no 
problem keeping around a local patch that corrects this behavior 
if folks don't feel it needs fixing.   From everything I've ever
done in this space, having needless alloc/free calls in a 
performance intensive path that requires low latency like a Lan 
driver is not a good thing.  
I am idle most of the time since I have eliminated all of the 
copy activity by using SCI in the system.  This is why it's 
idle most of the time.  Were I using the IP stack code in Linux
proper, the utilization would be through the roof.
