Why on earth is that using GFP_ATOMIC?  This function later goes on to
create procfs files and such things.
y'know, we could have a debug option which will spit warnings if someone
does a !__GFP_WAIT allocation while !in_atomic() (only works if
CONFIG_PREEMPT).  
But please, make it depend on !CONFIG_AKPM.  I shudder to think about all
the stuff it would pick up.
