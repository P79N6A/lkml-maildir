I did suggest this a few years ago. The comment I received was that
they didn't take suggestions from OS people, if I didn't have a drive
implementation to go with the proposal they couldn't use it for
anything. Which was interesting, since that seemed to suggest that t13
had little steering in ata development, they mainly put into the ATA
specs what drive manufacturers shoved at them. Of course this isn't 100%
true, but it does explain a lot of things :-)
Andre even tried getting FUA to do what we needed, no such luck there.
Some other bigger OS wanted it differently, the rest is history.
There's nothing I would love more than being able to kill the pre and
post flushes and use something more effective. So if we can write up a
proposal that has some chance of being debated, I'm all for it.
