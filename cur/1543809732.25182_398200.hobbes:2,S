well, may I remind that this solution would require _two_
init processes for each guest, which could easily make up
300-400 unnecessary processes in a lightweight server
setup?

well, at least Guests or VEs are terms already used by
existing projects, where pspace sounds somewhat strange.
at the same time I'd like to point out that *spaces is
a good name for the building blocks, but we definitely
have to name the 'construct' different, i.e. a 'guest'
(or VPS or VE or whatever) is _more_ than just a p-space
it's the sum of all *-spaces required to make it look
like a real linux system.
best,
