I don't know that that is.

It doesn't appear to be related to selinux.
On a stock, mostly-up-to-date FC5 installation:
	echo 0 > /selinux/enforce
	service autofs stop
	service nfs stop
	service nfs start
	service autofs start
sony:/home/akpm> ls -l /net/bix/usr/src
total 0
sony:/home/akpm> showmount -e bix
Export list for bix:
/           *
/usr/src    *
/mnt/export *
The automounter will mount bix:/ on /net/bix.  But I am unable to get it to
mount bix's /usr/src on /net/bix/usr/src.
On bix we have
bix:/home/akpm> mount
/dev/sda2 on / type ext3 (rw,noatime)
/dev/sdb1 on /usr/src type ext3 (rw,noatime)
...
Without git-nfs applied, /net/bix/usr/src mounts as expected.
iirc, we decided this is related to the fs-cache infrastructure work which
went into git-nfs.  I think David can reproduce this?
