Here is the result from 2.5.33
2.5.33-no_preemption.results:Average throughput :59695 messages per second
2.5.33.results:Average throughput : 59522 messages per second
No benefit from preemption.
Anyway, I'll back tomorrow with the results from 2.5.36 (with and withou preemption) running the test 
10 times and evaluating the average.
I'm gonna using this script:
#!/bin/sh
> `uname -r`_total.results
for i in `seq 1 1 10`
do
	./chat_c 127.0.0.1 30 1000 9999 >>`uname -r`_total.results
done
grep Average `uname -r`_total.results |cut -d " " -f 4| awk '{tot+=$1}; END {print "Average throughput: " tot/NR " messages per second"}'
If you have any suggestion, just let me know.
Ciao,
        Paolo
