errno.h as you can see...

Every distro I've ever played with has symlinks for /usr/include/linux and
/usr/include/asm into their respective directories in
/usr/src/linux/include..  So I've just assumed that that's the right way to
do it...
Regardless as to whether those links are there or not,  I fail to see how
else bits/errno.h is going to find {kernel-src-dir}/include/linux without
the -I$(HPATH)...  It can't know where linux/errno.h is otherwise...
