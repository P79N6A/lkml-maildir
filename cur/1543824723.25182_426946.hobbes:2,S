I guess what we wanted is a patch that addresses the concern of both 
patches and not a combination of the patches. IMHO the dirty notification 
of David's patch is possible with the shared dirty pages patch if we allow 
the set_page_dirty method in address operations to sleep and return an 
error code. However, this may raise some additional issues because we have 
to check whenever we dirty a page.
