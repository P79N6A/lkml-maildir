First of all I would like to say THANK YOU for your help.
I am now able to allocate up to ~3.2 GB of memory on a 4 GB Machine, even with 
shared libraries. 
This is what I have done.
1. I have activated the kernel option in  Kernel 2.4.21pre4aa3
   CONFIG_05GB=y
  This gives the following: 
    a: TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE is now 0xe000000 wich is  224 MB
    b: Upper Limit for User-Space memory is now at 3.5 GB
   So I have the potential to allocated up to 3360 MB of memory
2. I have exchanged malloc with anonymous mmap, since malloc
    was still only able to allocate about 2 GB.
