What's the rationale for not supporting interrupt priorities
in the kernel?
We're having a discussion of this in one of our CELF working
groups, and it would help if someone could explain why an
interrupt priority system has never been adopted in the
mainstream Linux kernel. (I know that some implementations
have been written and proposed).
Is there a strong policy against such a thing, or is it just
that the right implementation has not come along?
Thanks,
