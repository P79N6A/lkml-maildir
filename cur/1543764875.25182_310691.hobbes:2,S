actually, git would just include by reference the previous blob.
lets say we had the previous version of sched.c in a blob, ID 
cc4ee6107d19f89898a8c89d45810f01710f2ff4. We have the new edit (which is 
small, lets say 20 bytes) in blob e010fab710092b19be6e26de1721e249dff2d141.
We'd create the combo-blob representing the new version of sched.c, the 
following way:
	include cc4ee6107d19f89898a8c89d45810f01710f2ff4 0 54010
	include e010fab710092b19be6e26de1721e249dff2d141 0 20
	include cc4ee6107d19f89898a8c89d45810f01710f2ff4 54030 73061
so we'd include (by reference) most of the previous version, with a 
small blob for the extras. Since sched.c compresses down to 36K, we 
saved ~32K of bandwidth, and somewhere on the order of 20K of storage.
to construct the combo blob later on, we do have to unpack sched.c (and 
if it's already a combo-blob that is not cached then we'd have to unpack 
all parents until we arrive at some full blob).

we'd have 2 new objects (the 'delta' and the 'combo' blob).
(if # of objects is an issue then we could include new data in the combo 
blob itself too, but that's getting too complex i think.)
