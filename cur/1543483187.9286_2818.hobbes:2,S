	Summary:
	1 kB   ->   16 GB
	2 kB   ->  256 GB
	4 kB   ->    4 TB
	8 kB   ->   32 TB  (limit is block counter)
(8kB is _not_ portabel, it requires 8k pages, so you can't use it on ix86!!)
	That assumes you won't hit a 32-bit sector number limit in some
	other part of the kernel, cutting you off at 1 TB or 2 TB.

	Umm...  Propably not.  While the theorethical block addressability
	goes up like (blksize/4)**3 function, the maximum offset encodable
	with blocks is different (non-exponential) function:
	32-bits per block offset within FS, giving us 4G blocks maximum.
		blksize	offset	(blksize/4)^3	max size
		1k	 4 TB	  16 GB		 16 GB
		2k	 8 TB	 256 GB		256 GB
		4k	16 TB	   4 TB		  4 TB
		8k	32 TB	  64 TB		 32 TB
	So, you can't have 70TB filesystem with EXT2 even if you had the
	hardware...  (counting with 1024 byte kilos that is 64 TB)
	Also I think that at Intel you are better off to limit yourself
	to 4k blocks as those match paging system page size, and using
	larger blocks than pagesize is rather difficult...
