BTW the wavefront driver documentation says:
"The Tropez Plus (and perhaps other WF cards) can in theory support
up to 2 physical MIDI interfaces. One of these is connected to the
ICS2115 chip (the WaveFront synth itself) and is controlled by
MPU/UART-401 emulation code running as part of the WaveFront OS.  The
other is controlled by the CS4232 chip present on the board. However,
physical access to the CS4232 connector is difficult, and it is
unlikely (though not impossible) that you will want to use it."
But as I said before I have a CS4231 chip on my board...
