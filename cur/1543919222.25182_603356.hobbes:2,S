OK. The directory structure is as follow:
+ sys + kernel + boot_params - version			/* version of boot protocol */
                             - data			/* binary file of boot_params */
                             + setup_data + 0 - type	/* type id of setup_data 0 */
                                              - data	/* binary file of setup_data 0 */
                                          + 1 - type	/* type id of setup_data 1 */
                                              - data	/* binary file of setup_data 1 */
                                          + 2 - type
                                              - data
                                          ...
