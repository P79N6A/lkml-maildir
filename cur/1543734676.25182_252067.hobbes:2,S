Subject: [patch] preempt-lock-need-resched.patch, 2.6.9-rc2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

the attached preempt-lock-need-resched.patch is ontop of the preempt-smp
and preempt-cleanups patches. It adds lock_need_resched() which is to
check for the necessity of lock-break in a critical section. Used by
later latency-break patches.
tested on x86, should work on all architectures.
