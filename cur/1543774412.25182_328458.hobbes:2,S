Well.  Maybe directories really are of no use, but mknod/symlink/unlink
*are* useful.  That same mdadm who needs to create /dev/mdX *before*
that device is created?  And socket for /dev/log...
And oh, directories.. devpts?  Stuff like cciss/... represented in sysfs
like cciss!... ?
I don't see anything wrong with allowing creating/removing files in
the filesystem (except of possible locking issues which can arise) --
in-kernel support just does mknod/unlink on insert/remove, and if
that fails (EEXIST/ENOENT), well, so be it...
And since the whole namespace is now flat, another question comes in:
is there any guarantee the names will not overlap?  /dev/ttyS0 and
/dev/usb/ttyS0 (I don't remember which one it was, but I *think* I
saw same names but in different dirs in /dev...)
