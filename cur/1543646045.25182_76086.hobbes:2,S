>Are we absolutely sure no applications use this?
Xinetd uses it, which is what kicked off the original
discussion 2 days ago. Inetd applications are probably
the only applications that need this so they can
downgrade a socket for an old app. If its deprecated
and not on other platforms, I'm going to need to
change xinetd anyways. Sus v3 does not mention
IPV6_ADDRFORM at all.

Hmmm, I only wanted to renumber the options since #1
was removed. Sorry if it changed the alignment.
Cheers,
