you do, if you inline the code and every drive writer use this tecnique the kernel will
be much bigger don't you think ?!?
Makeing a simple function instead is quite slower I think... don't forget that goto are
used only in error recovery routines ...
You can simply build a "stack" of labels .. IMHO this is a great way to be sure of the
right order we are performing cleanup/recovery ...
