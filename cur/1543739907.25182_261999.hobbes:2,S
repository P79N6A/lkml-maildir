        Hi David,
        This are all the IrDA patches that were pending, ready for
inclusion in 2.6.9. Tested on my SMP box and laptop with 2.6.9, and by
various IrDA users.
	Most changes will be invisible to users, apart from the via
and stir changes that allow the drivers to work better.
	Linus might be busy under the mountain of patches, but I'm
sure he need my patches ;-)
	Jean

irXXX_stir_reset.diff :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		<Patch from Stephen Hemminger>
	o [CORRECT] stir4200 - get rid of reset on speed change
The Sigmatel 4200 doesn't accept the address setting which gets done on
USB reset.  The USB core recently changed to resend address (or
something like that), so usb_reset_device is failing.
The device works without doing the USB reset on speed change, it just
will be less robust in recovering when things get wedged (like coming
out of FIR mode).
