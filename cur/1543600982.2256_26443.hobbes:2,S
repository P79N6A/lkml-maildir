this is wrong; the CPU _internal_ view of the data is always consistent,
regardless of movntq vs movq.
It's only the EXTERNAL view that is slightly different. "sfence" takes
care of syncing that.

It does; but if you read it back from memory and is corrupted, your
chipset corrupted it.

I benchmarked several versions, see the testprogram at
http://www.fenrus.demon.nl/athlon.c
The interleaved one is faster on athlons because it seems to help AMD's
register aliasing logic
to operate better....
Anyway, since this code works for like 99% of the machines, and only 1%
seems to be affected, it really really really looks like a hardware bug.
This is also more or less proven by the reports that certain
biosversions "break" working setups by doing things to the via chipset
that make it break....
