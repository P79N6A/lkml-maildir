In POSIX, select/pselect is specifically exempted from the usual SA_RESTART
behavior.  I'm not really sure if that is entirely historical or because
after a handler has run even an adjusted relative timeout may no longer be
what you actually want.  There is no such exemption for poll/ppoll, though
in general their behavior and specification are very parallel.  I wonder if
they really should diverge.
Thanks,
Roland
