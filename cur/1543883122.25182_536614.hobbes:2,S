The gang allocation affair would may also want to make the calls into
the page allocator batched. For instance, grab enough compound pages to
build the gang under the lock, since we're going to blow the per-cpu
lists with so many pages, then break the compound pages up outside the
zone->lock.
I think it'd be good to have some corresponding tactics for freeing as
well.
