I think the only way to measure it is with a latency measurement thing - 
like the one used for some of the RT tuning.
However, the latency measurement should not care too much about individual
millisecond latencies, but only holler when it finds _combined_ bad
latencies in the 1/10+ second range (which is human-perceptible).
One problem is trying to find a good load for the tester program itself
(it should not just sit in a tight loop, it should have a memory footprint
and some delays of its own).
