Subject: [patch] 2.3.35pre3: Don't reset parallel port devs at init

Hi Linus,
Here is a patch to prevent resetting things like printers when parport_pc
initialises.  The rationale is that
(a) it makes fetching the device ID (which is done afterwards) more
    reliable, and
(b) the user can force a reset using tunelp after lp loads if they really
    want to.
Tim.
