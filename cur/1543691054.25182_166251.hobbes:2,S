What CPU are you running on?  It isn't an Opteron is it?  I saw the same
thing with the NUMA support for the AMD64.
Use "make menuconfig" and have a look at all the options under the first
few menus.  Make sure your CPU and power management options look right
for your machine.  When in doubt read the help text for the option, it
is sometimes very helpful.
