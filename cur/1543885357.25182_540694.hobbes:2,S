Ok, i can't understand if the patch will be included in 2.6.22 (i
didn't see it in the Andrew Morton merge plan). However, if you can
confirm the inclusion, i can send bug reports for ubuntu and gentoo. I
can even send an email to Miquel van Smoorenburg, who should be the
mainstream sysvinit developer (and probably the last maintainer).
