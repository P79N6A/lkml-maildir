It's a known bug. If your system supports both S4 and S4bios, only the 
latter may be selected.

The string 's4bios' only makes sense on systems that support it, while 
'disk' is concise and obvious, regardless on how your platform implements 
it. I don't want to have options that are only relevant on a subset of the 
systems out there.
