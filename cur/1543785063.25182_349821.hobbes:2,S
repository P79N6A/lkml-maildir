I'm getting a linker error due to disable_timer_pin_1, which is defined in
io_apic.c as int disable_timer_pin_1 __initdata;
but I'm building with
CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC=y
# CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC is not set
CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC=y
The error is in setup.c, which can't find the variable since io_apic.c isn't
being compiled in.
arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o(.init.text+0xd51): In function `parse_cmdline_early':
: undefined reference to `disable_timer_pin_1'
