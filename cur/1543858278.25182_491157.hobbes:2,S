Ralph,
I'm seeing dozens of build warnings and errors on ia64 from
infiniband.  According to git you touched it last, so even
if you aren't to blame, you are by definition an expert :-)
E.g.
In file included from include/rdma/ib_addr.h:37,
                 from drivers/infiniband/core/addr.c:39:
include/rdma/ib_verbs.h: In function `ib_sg_dma_address':
include/rdma/ib_verbs.h:1572: warning: implicit declaration of function `sg_dma_address'
include/rdma/ib_verbs.h: In function `ib_sg_dma_len':
include/rdma/ib_verbs.h:1584: warning: implicit declaration of function `sg_dma_len'
Adding a #include <linux/pci.h> would shut them up (as the defines for
sg_dma_address and sg_dma_len are in asm/pci.h) ... but I've no idea
whether this is the right fix.
