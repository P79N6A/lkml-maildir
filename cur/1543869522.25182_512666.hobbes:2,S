Andrew,
it is definitely NOT my job to repair errors that other responsibility-free people pushed into vanilla mainline without the slightest test effort in some mm-tree for example. Who wasted it must repair it, without the slightest discussion!
I have provided enough information and energy to establish guidelines how to fix that error.
Above that I am still waiting for my linuxtv patches being applied which would be a nice and honest gesture.
Any further questions, Mr. Morton, or did I pronounce clear?
So take action now please!
Yours sincerely
Uwe
