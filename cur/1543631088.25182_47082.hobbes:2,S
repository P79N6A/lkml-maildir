   It is likely that block is being set as -EPERM or something like that,
   but I'm not sure.
Interesting analysis.
However, I walked over this code a few times and I cannot
find a way that -EPERM can land there.
What might be happening, instead, is that due to some bug
in ext2_alloc_block we end up with -1 as the answer.  It
would be useful to add some debugging there to see if the
return value 'j' is ever -1 when we set *err to '0'.
