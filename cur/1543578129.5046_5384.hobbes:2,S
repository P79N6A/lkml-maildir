hmmmm, interesting that you should mention usb in this conversation.
there's a problem with usb in smp-enabled kernels running on the via
apollo pro 133a chipset.  basically, unless apic is disabled, the usb
controller (usb-uhci) doesn't get any interrupts and no usb device will
be recognized.  this has existed since the early 2.4.0-test days, if not
earlier.
i was talking with johannes erdfelt about this and he feels that it's a
pci irq routing problem.  as of yet, we haven't been able to find anyone
who can help.  we do see an occasional message on linux-usb about this
problem though.

from a follow-up post, i get the impression that this won't help with
smp-enabled systems, but if there's something similar that you think
might help solve this one, please let me know and i'll be more than
happy to oblige.
thanks,
