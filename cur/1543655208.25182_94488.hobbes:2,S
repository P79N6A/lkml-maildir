I use a set of tests provided by Erich that use the cpu information from
the task.  This information is crucial for understanding how processes
are dispatched across CPUs (and nodes on NUMA boxes).  I've applied
Erich's patch and it restores this data, making his tests useful.  Could
this patch be considered for inclusion?  Please.
