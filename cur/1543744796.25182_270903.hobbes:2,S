unfortunately the POST-flush is still needed. Without it i can see lots
of spurious interrupts on SMP systems. (most likely caused by the ACK
reaching the IO-APIC _before_ the mask-the-irq PCI-space write [which
gets delayed in the chipset due to write optimizations], so the IO-APIC
still thinks that the IRQ is enabled and for level-triggered IRQs this
means that another interrupt is sent to the CPU.)
