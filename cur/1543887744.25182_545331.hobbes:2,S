Okay, I've established that this is a bug in the Qemu kernel loader: the
Qemu loader puts zero in the loadflags, which is wrong no matter how you
slice it.
I have checked in a workaround in the git.newsetup tree; the workaround
is to rely on a compile-time value for load low/load high instead of
looking at loadflags.
