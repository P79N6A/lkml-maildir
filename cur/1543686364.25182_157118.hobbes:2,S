But I've not yet patched the kernel, and while booting it says:
Aug 13 09:13:59 sirith kernel: hde: 312581808 sectors (160042 MB) w/8192KiB Cache, CHS=19457/255/63, UDMA(100)
hdparm -i also says:
 UDMA modes: udma0 udma1 udma2 udma3 udma4 *udma5 
So I think it should use UDMA(100), which should give more than 20MB/s
(Seagate says the drive does 32-58MB/s sustained transfer rate)
