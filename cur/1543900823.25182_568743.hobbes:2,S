Subject: Re: [PATCH] replace kmem_cache_alloc with kmem_cache_zalloc to remove some following zero initializations.

Look, until you have any numbers in hands it's impossible to say
which one is faster.
Please measure N d_alloc()'s on i686 and some other archs w/o string operations
and compare whether your patch improves something or not.
