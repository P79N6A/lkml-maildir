As far as I know there are no items at issue.  No one has suggested
that there actually are any patents to worry about.  The big complaint
is just that the IBTA member companies haven't made enough promises
about their patents.
The OpenIB subversion repository can be checked out by anyone
interested.  Anyone who wants to can look the code over and look for
something patent encumbered.
Thanks,
