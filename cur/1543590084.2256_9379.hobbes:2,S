  Well you asked for it :) :
clear_page by 'normal_clear_page'        took 12196 cycles (318.1 MB/s)
clear_page by 'slow_zero_page'           took 12207 cycles (317.9 MB/s)
clear_page by 'fast_clear_page'          took 29272 cycles (132.6 MB/s)
clear_page by 'faster_clear_page'        took 4831 cycles (803.1 MB/s)
copy_page by 'normal_copy_page'  took 12607 cycles (307.8 MB/s)
copy_page by 'slow_copy_page'    took 13617 cycles (285.0 MB/s)
copy_page by 'fast_copy_page'    took 9531 cycles (407.1 MB/s)
copy_page by 'faster_copy'       took 5585 cycles (694.7 MB/s)
copy_page by 'even_faster'       took 5621 cycles (690.3 MB/s)
copy_page by 'even_faster_nopre'         took 5837 cycles (664.8 MB/s)
copy_page by 'c_source'  took 17296 cycles (224.3
MB/s)                         
 The last one is yours :).  I'd assume this is because the compiler is
not
using mmx instructions for this. (the nopre is a routine I added to
check
the speed with only a single prefetch instruction.  When I tried adding
the routing with the single prefetch instruction to mmx.c and
recompiling
and rebooted, the system stayed up a lot longer, but it still crashed (I
was in Xwindows and the crash was partially written to the log file)
after around 3 minutes of work in X.
