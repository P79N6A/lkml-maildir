I started to do something like that, but got to dead end (shared
object directories...). Maybe this is usefull to someone, and maybe
not...

	Kernel hacker's guide to git
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      2005 Pavel Machek <pavel@suse.cz>
You can get git at 
http://pasky.or.cz/~pasky/dev/git/
 . Compile it,
and place it somewhere in $PATH. Then you can get kernel by running
mkdir clean-git; cd clean-git
git init rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
... Run git log to get idea of what happened in tree you are
tracking. Do git pull linus to pickup latest changes from Linus. You
can do git diff to see what changes you done in your local tree. git
cancel will kill any such changes.
You can commit changes by doing git commit... If you want to get diff
of your changes against mainline, do
git diff -r origin: 
. If you want to get the same diff but separated patch-by-patch, do
git patch origin:
. (Does something unexpected after first merge).
To update your tree against name "foo", do:
        git track linus
        git pull
or
        git merge linus
How to set up your trees so that you can cooperate with linus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What I did:
Created clean-git. Initialized straight from Linus (as above). Then I
created my "dirty" working tree:
git fork pavel /data/l/linux-git
and created "nice" tree, good for pulling
git fork good /data/l/linux-good
. I do my work in linux-git. If someone sends me nice patch I should
pass up, I apply it to linux-good with nice message and do
git merge good
in my working tree.
Publishing your trees
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
on remote server: (as an optimization...)
cd ~/WWW/git
rsync -zavP rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git .
mv linux-2.6.git good.git
then on localhost: 
cd /data/l/linux-good
rsync -zavP -essh --delete .git pavel@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz:~/WWW/git/good.git
[Oops, bad. cogito -created forks use symlinks in a way which is quite "interesting".]
