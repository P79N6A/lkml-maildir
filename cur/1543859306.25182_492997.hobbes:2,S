The reason was that my dev tree was tainted by this bug:
        if (good_bytes &&
-           scsi_end_request(cmd, 1, good_bytes, !!result) == NULL)
+           scsi_end_request(cmd, 1, good_bytes, result == 0) == NULL)
                return;
in scsi_io_completion().  I had there !!result which is wrong, and when
I diffed against master, it produced a bad patch.
As James mentioned one of the chunks is good and can go in.
