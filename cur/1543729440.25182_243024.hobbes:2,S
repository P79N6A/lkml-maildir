Ok, it is not absurd. It is insane. :)
As far as I know, POSIX compliant read() and write() et al. are
supposed to be serializable.

The following scenario appears to be possible when the default
implementation in do_readv_writev() is used:
1. process P1 calls writev(), writes the 1st chunk
   fs specific write operation grabs i_sem when it starts...
   and releases it when it finished
2. process P2 calls write() on the same file
   i_sem is free now, and P2 can grab it..and release it again
3. process P1 writes the 2nd chunk
   i_sem is free again, and P1 can grab it to write the 2nd chunk
The good news is some filesystems use generic_file_writev() (ext2, ext3)
or their own implementation (xfs) rather than the "supergeneric" code in
do_readv_writev(). The bad news is some other filesystems (reiser) use the
"supergeneric" code.

When I hold a mandatory lock on a file then no other process will be
allowed to read from/write to (depending on the type of the lock) that
file, right? The code (vfs_read(), vfs_write(), do_readv_writev()) in
Linux appears to work as follows:
1. locks_verify_area() is called
2. file i/o is performed
As far as I can tell, the process holds no locks covering both steps.
Another process might call fcntl(...F_SETLK...) between steps 1 and 2,
i.e. after locks_verify_area() said "ok" but before the actual i/o is
finished, and the result would be one process doing i/o on a file
while the other process holds a mandatory lock on the same file.
