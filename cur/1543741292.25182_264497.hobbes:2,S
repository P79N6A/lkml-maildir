That's assuming that your machine will even *boot* correctly and cleanly if the
contents of the NVRAM are put back.
And if you're doing the "write it down and type it in again" thing, you might
as well just use a passphrase, as it's defeating the whole concept of
using /dev/nvram to xor against....
