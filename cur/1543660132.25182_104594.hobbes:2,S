   I'll also attempt to get a SPARC toolchain together (as I understand it,
   there are some divergences from mainline/current gcc/binutils) and do
   some compiletesting-like and API conversion things there.
For sparc64 we use an old CVS egcs snapshot as that is the
only thing which builds reliable kernels, especially in 2.5.x
