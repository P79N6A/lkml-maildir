This should test (task->flags & PF_KTHREAD).  (But it's superfluous anyway.)

The usual test to write here is just "if (task->exit_state)".
(But it's superfluous anyway.)

Correct.

Is always possible for a TASK_TRACED task to suddenly die via SIGKILL, and
it's even possible it will be reaped (EXIT_DEAD) despite ptrace, in the
de_thread() (MT exec) case.  This race is tolerable for everything ptrace
does (it holds a task ref, and the arch code copes).  It must also be
tolerated by the perfmon code.

ptrace_check_attach() ensures that this is so.
