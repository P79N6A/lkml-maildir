Once I upgraded X to 4.3 and changed /dev/psaux to /dev/input/mice 
everything is OK (and I'm quite happy it works :)
I guess (now) that it's not much related to other problems mentioned in this
thread, but if you think it might be helpful I can post some more info.
BTW - For testing purposes I've tested few different combinations:
AC -'another computer' MC- 'my computer'; both: kernel 2.6.0t1, recently
    upgraded Debian SID
AC  X4.2 and /dev/psaux ->ok
    X4.3 and /dev/psaux -> ok (I hope my sister won't
                               be angry, that I've reconfigured
			       her system when she's back home 8)
MC with different mouse -> no change
MC with different values of xres, yres, psmouse_resolution parameters -> no change
MC, X4.2 and /dev/psaux -> too fast
    X4.2 and /dev/psaux & ACPI off -> too fast
    X4.3 and /dev/psaux -> too fast
    X4.2 and /dev/input/mice -> too fast
          (IIRC - I'm _almost_ sure I tried it with 
 		2.5.75 few days ago [and it did not work])
    X4.3 and /dev/input/mice -> ok
[cut]
