The tg3 firmware should be delivered with the kernel; and any
infrastructure that does not continue to work seamlessly with
firmware-separate-from-tg3 is a non-starter.  That's why I say there's
no chicken-and-egg:  presumption of such implies half a solution.
Dual mode drivers are only useful for the 1-2 developers working on
firmware loading.
Someone needs to make the effort to create and test a solution, rather
than half measures which -do- imply a c-and-e problem.
