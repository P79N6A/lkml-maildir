Yeah.  There may be some demand for 8-bit pseudocolor, but 16-bit 
truecolor seems a bit pointless.
However, if the host interface has some intelligence in it, then we 
could have pixels in the framebuffer ALWAYS 32 bits, but we can make 
them LOOK like 8 or 16 bit pixels to the host.

When compositing images, it's important to know "how much pixel" has 
been painted already.  If the screen's blank and all pixels therefore 
are completely transparent, and you draw something with antialised 
edges, you want to keep track of the fact that the edges are "not all 
there" so that if another triangle gets drawn that abuts the first one, 
they merge together perfectly.
