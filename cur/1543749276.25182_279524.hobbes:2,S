Running ntpd used to keep the clock dead on, now my 2.6 systems all 
drift one way or the other. I suspect that the system calls used by ntpd 
have changed somehow, but until I find the time to look harder I can't 
say that except as conjecture.
The sad thing is that most of the systems have quite good hardware clocks...
