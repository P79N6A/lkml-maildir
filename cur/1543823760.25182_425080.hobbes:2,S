Agreed.
Note that on ext2-devel there has been a huge amount of activity over
the past month to get extents, and >32-bit block addressing, ready for
ext3.  One of the things needed for that is a new jbd-level feature for
64-bit capability, so ext3 is going to need more dynamic access to the
jbd feature bits soon.  This is definitely not the right time to be
removing feature access from the API!
