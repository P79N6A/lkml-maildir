Good point.  I queued a patch to kill it.

Well, not really.  I very much doubt if we ever had any inodes with a zero
in ->i_blksize.  I suspect that code (which has been like that since at
least 2.6.12) just never did anything.

As Mikulas points out, (1 << anything) won't be evaluating to zero.  This code
is long-dead.
