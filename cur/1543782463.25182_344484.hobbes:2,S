It turns out you are exactly right on all points. :-)

That makes a lot of sense, and it appears to be the case.

Yes, this works!  It's so simple --- I can't believe I
didn't try it before.  I did mess around with iptables,
trying to add some weird PREROUTEing DNAT that would
redirect the packets, but I didn't know what I was doing.

Yes, it did help.  Thanks a bunch, Eric!  Your memory seems
to be in great shape. :-)
