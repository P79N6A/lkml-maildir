Although I think what is less contentious is that Con's stuff is an 
improvement over the 2.6 tree, and the consensus is that _something_
as to be done to it. So it is quite sad that the scheduler in 2.6 is
sitting there doing nothing but waiting to be obsoleted, while Con's
good (and begnin) scheduler patches are waiting around and getting
less than 1% of the testing they need.
