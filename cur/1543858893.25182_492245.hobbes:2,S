Ok. I don't see anything wrong off-hand, but I'll keep the patch in the 
tree in the hopes that Andi and/or Eric can see what's wrong and solve it.
If we don't find a solution, I'll have to revert it, but let's give it a 
few more days. 
Tobias, can you please make sure to remind me about this if nothing seems 
to happen? 
Thanks,
			Linus
