One more minor problem - the first two patches are missing the
following defines, and result in compile issues:
#define MAX_INTERNODE_LB 40
#define MIN_INTERNODE_LB 4
#define NODE_BALANCE_RATIO 10
Looking through previous patches, and the 05 patch, I found
these defines and put them under the #if CONFIG_NUMA in sched.c
that defines node_nr_running and friends.
With these three lines added, I have a kernel built and booted
using the first numa-sched and numa-sched-add patches.
Test results will follow later in the day.
