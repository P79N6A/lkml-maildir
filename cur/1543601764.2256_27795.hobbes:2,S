It looks like my patch was unmerged in 2.4.10-pre12, as Linus merged the
AGP GART code from Alan's tree which does not yet have AMD 761 support. 
The patch for Alan is pending and hopefully will be in the next -ac.
Applying the 2.4.10-pre11 patch should half apply (the config entries
are still there, and some of the header code, but not the main detection
stuff), but that would work.
I am rediffing a patch (and some other minor cleanup) for 2.4.10-pre12
and I will send it to Linus.  I will CC you and the list.
