Subject: [PATCH] implement in-kernel keys & keyring management [try #5]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I've modified my patch to avoid a locking error that Al Viro pointed out. If
you have two keyrings A and B, if one process tries to link A to B, whilst in
parallel another process tries to link B to A, it could end up creating a
cycle in the graph. I've added code to serialise link calls with respect to
one another to obviate that problem.
