hello, 
i recall having this happen in 2.5 (although i think it also occured under X).  
afaik this has to do with the new input system (check atkbd.c).  im not sure if 
this is the correct fix, but i simply modified my jp106 keymap:
--- jp106.map.orig      2003-07-16 11:40:25.000000000 +0900
+++ jp106.map   2003-07-16 11:40:00.000000000 +0900
@@ -64,3 +64,6 @@
 keycode  97 = Control
 keycode 124 = backslash        bar
        control keycode 124 = Control_backslash
+keycode 183 = backslash        bar
+        control keycode 183 = Control_backslash
+
(i left the 124 there because i sometimes go back into 2.4 kernels)
and i think i needed to recompile my loadkeys (from kbd-1.08) as
addkey didnt like the 183 index (due to KEY_MAX, iirc).
hope that works/is the correct way to deal with this issue.
