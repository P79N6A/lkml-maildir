These messages tell you that something bad happened and data stream that
is coming from the mouse hardware does not match selected protocol. In your
case it turns out that PM callback isn't get called at all. This leaves
the touchpad in relative mode (after BIOS init) while Synaptics driver
expects so called absolute protocol. Normally you should not see these
messages, they signal that something went wrong.
Now, you activated psmouse_resetafter option. I coded it to take care of
my docking station resetting the touchpad back into relative mode without
telling anyone. If it is active then Synaptics tries to re-initialize 
itself after so many bad packets (1 in your case).
What I am trying to tell is that pm_callback does not affect anything in
your case, its psmouse_resetafter that does re-initialization.
Andrew, the patch, although probably not needed should be still valid as 
there is no point of trying to reconnect when suspending.

There is only one module called psmouse that supports different flavors
of PS/2 protocol along with (optional) Synaptics protocol. You should try
to "modprobe psmouse psmouse_resetafter=X".
