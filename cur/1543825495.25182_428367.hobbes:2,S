I second this request -- we would like to use hrtimers in SystemTap
modules.  The patch that Stephen provided would be sufficient for our
use as well.
I requested this a few months ago, and it was rejected on grounds that
the API was not yet stable enough for export.  I hope that now it has
had time to settle so that modules may use the new API.
Thanks,
