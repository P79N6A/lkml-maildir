I am not in favour of introducing such configuration options.
This is just the default for a mount option. No twiddling at
kernel configuration time is required or useful.
We have too many configuration options. It is not true that the system
becomes better when there are more compile-time configuration possibilities.
Quite the contrary.
Compilation options should select inclusion of subsystems,
modules, drivers, but not twiddle behaviour.

[So, I would be happier if you selected a default and made everybody who
wants something else adapt her /etc/fstab, or alias for a mountfat command.]
