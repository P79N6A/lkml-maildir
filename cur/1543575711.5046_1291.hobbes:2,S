If you own a p6 class machine (sorry but I didn't find your hw specs in
previous messages)
you should be able to enter setup and disable L1 and/or L2 usually in
"advanced setup".
If you disable L1, the machine will be *much* slower.
If you disable L2, you will notice it under heavy load.
Most of the times sig 11 is due L1 cache overheating (on chip). Just
controlling whether cpu cooling fan is properly seated and spinning solves
the problem.
