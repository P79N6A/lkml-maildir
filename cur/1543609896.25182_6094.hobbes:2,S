Units of what?  Probably jiffies.  Also "unused" is actually better
described as "idle".

Looks like (in order):
- total number of I/O operations on this drive
- read I/O operations
- read I/O sectors
- write I/O operations
- write I/O sectors

This appears to be the time in seconds (i.e. unix time = seconds
since Jan 1, 1970), when the system booted. time(0) - btime will
give you uptime in seconds, (as should the sum of all the "cpu"
times / HZ, if you knew what HZ was in userspace).
Cheers, Andreas
