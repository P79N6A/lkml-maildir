Yes...  alan snuck that __devexit_p usage in there ;-)
We need to create __exit_p as the #warning indicates, because this 
driver does not support CONFIG_HOTPLUG intentionally.  For now, I think 
it is better to add #ifdef MODULE to the driver in struct pci_driver 
definition, because using "__devexit" as in your patch is incorrect.
So if you wanted to submit the patch changing __devexit_p to #ifdef 
MODULE, that could probably be applied...
