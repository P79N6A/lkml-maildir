:  I certainly disagree. This is like claiming that because assembly 
: language better represents the way a computer works, people who can't 
: learn it should better not write any programs.
Can you back your disagreement up with some examples of non-trivial programs
which are successfully using your model and were unable to just as quickly
sucessfully use MPI/PVM/etc?
:  However, I stress again that unlike most other DSM system, DIPC uses 
: strict consistency. 
I don't believe that that term has any meaning, even on a uniprocessor
single threaded program.  What does it mean?  Are the registers consistent
with memory?  Are they consistent only after procedure calls?  What about
store ordering?  What about register write buffers?
:  DIPC makes the programming task easier by allowing the programmer to not 
: worry about invoking the right send/receive calls at the right places in 
: his code. I think this is a great help. 
Actual experience has shown the opposite.
