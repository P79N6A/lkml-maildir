Hi!
> (This is for -mm, to be merged along with the aty128fb and radeonfb

> 
> This patch adds suspend/resume support to the Apple UniNorth AGP bridge
> to make sure AGP is properly disabled when the machine goes to sleep.
> Without this, the r300 based laptops will fail to wakeup from sleep when
> using the new experimental r300 DRI driver. It should also improve
> reliablility in general with other chips.
