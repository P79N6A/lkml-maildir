basically sum_exec_runtime is split up to form a precise utime/stime, 
using the stime/utime ratio as the factor.

the problem occurs when there's a different "split" dictated by 
p->stime/p->utime. The sum of stime+utime as reported should be 
monotonic, but the individual components may not. (the reason is that we 
have a precise "sum" for free, given by the scheduler, but we do not 
want the overhead of per-syscall timestamps to get a precise stime/utime 
numbers. So we sample p->stime and p->utime from the scheduler tick.)
