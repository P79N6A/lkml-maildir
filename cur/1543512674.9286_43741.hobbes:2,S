$ as -o bootsect.o bootsect.s

GNU assembler 2.9.5

 So the above error pertains to old as releases.

 It was fixed long time ago.  Anyway using binutils from 2.9.1 series for
16-bit code is at least risky -- misassembles are quite normal with them,
not even regarding the linker.  On the other hand, 2.9.4 and 2.9.5 are
probably safe but they are not release versions.  Actually, 2.9.1.0.25
might work well, too, but be cautious. 
 Bug reports are normally sent to <bug-gnu-utils@gnu.org>; there is also a
mailing list at <binutils@sourceware.cygnus.com> for these who are
interested in binutils development.
