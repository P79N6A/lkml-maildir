Basically, think about the interactions of
	CPU#1			CPU#2
	irq handler		bottom half handler
	wait_on_bh();		cli();
and I've solved it by simply prioiritizing in a very simple manner:
hardware interrupts have "higher priority" than bottom half handlers, and
as such a hardware interrupt will never wait for a bottom half handler.
Deadlock avoided.
