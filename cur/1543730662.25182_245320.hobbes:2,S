Sounds like a bad idea for file servers ;)
Wouldn't it be better to lazily move these cached pages to
a "cached" list like the BSDs have, and reclaim it immediately
when the memory is needed for something else ?
It should be easy enough to keep the cached data around and
still have the cache pages easily reclaimable.
