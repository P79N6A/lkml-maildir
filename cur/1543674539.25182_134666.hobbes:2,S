Out of curiosity, is someone hitting that with a real program?

aside:
if so, I suppose nano-ticks may be needed.  rounding up gave us too many 
"nano-ticks", and was the first problem with irman, which brought round 
down into activate_task().  now, test-starve.c appears, and it turns out to 
be too many nano-ticks _missing_.  (rounding up doesn't "fix" that one btw 
[too fast], but what I did to demonstrate the problem does re-break irman 
rather nicely:)
