You mount with the new kernel without "-o extents", and find files with
extents "lsattr -R /mnt/tmp | awk '/----e / print { $2 }'", copy those
files, mv over old files, unmount.
A similar thing is necessary for ext3 filesystems before you can mount them
as ext2 - they can't be mounted as ext2 until the journal is recovered
(an unrecovered journal is an incompatible feature).
