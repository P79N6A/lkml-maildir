I've got the same problem as the one above, with a Realtek rtl8139.
The problem I'm seeing is that 
dev->resource[0].start == 0x00000000 and dev->resource[0].end == 0xff
which will not jive with various checks in pcibios_enable_device()
It's still working in 2.4.21-pre3, and the last kernel I was able to boot 
succesfully was 2.5.48, although I know for a fact that 2.5.54 already had 
the problem. 
Hardware on my laptop (Inspiron 8000) is a TI PCI1445 cardbus bridge.
