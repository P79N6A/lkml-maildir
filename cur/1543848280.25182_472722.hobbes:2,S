This looks rather wrong - skge_exit() will run unregister_netdev() again.
Look a few lines down, to where this function already handles request_irq()
failure, reuse that code path.  Hopefully it has been tested..
(Once we have an easy-to-use fault-injection framework we'll be able to
test all these things more easily)
(But it's possible to test them already, with a bit of ad-hoc testing code)
