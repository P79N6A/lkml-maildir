OK, I changed my mind about the trigger and made some experiments with
the cross-node balancer called after every N calls of
load_balance. If we make N tunable, we can even have some dynamics in
case the nodes are unbalanced: make N small if the current node is
less loaded than the average node loads, make N large if the node is
averagely loaded. I'll send the patches in a separate email.

The fact that we're doing fine on kernbench and numa_test/schedbench
is (I think) understandeable. In both benchmarks a process cannot
change its node during its lifetime, therefore has minimal memory
latency. In numa_test the "disturbing" hackbench just cannot move away
any of the tasks from their originating node. Therefore the results
are the best possible.
