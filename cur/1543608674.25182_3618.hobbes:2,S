Exactly, but if init does not have PID 1, we fail.  Kai,
it works for HPA because of the magic kernel command line
incantation:
	root=/dev/ram0 (apparently with or without devfs)
Without this, init does NOT get PID 1 and therefore it
all goes south rather quickly.  The pivot_root syscall
is handy, but its operation under 2.4.x is disingenuous
at best.
