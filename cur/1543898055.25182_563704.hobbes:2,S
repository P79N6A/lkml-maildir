This is kind of obvious. It is just description of softnet.

The first paragraph describes softirq, nothing else.
I have already understood when you say "technological",
you mean "terminological". "softirq" is just a term to describe
"softnet" workflow in an intelligible way. Call it from inside
irq handler, rather than in irq_exit, this changes _NOTHING_.
I understood that you describe original pre-historic
softnet model. You just want to replace softirq run at irq_exit
with an explicit soft{net,scsi,whatever}_call, which could
execute immediately or can be queued for later. I hope I am wrong,
because this is... mmm... not a progress.

When talking about softnet, yes.
No, when talking about "implementing non-reentrancy via another,
more flexible mechanism". We are not on the same page.
I am afraid even the books are different. :-)
I need to think about this and really read -rt code, this sounds so crazy
that it can be even correct.
Timeout, we are far out of topic anyway.
