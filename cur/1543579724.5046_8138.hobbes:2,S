That is what I was guessing. But insmod does not need all symbols
present in the .o. 
I need to do this because when I release the driver to the customer,
I don't want them to be aware of some of the symbols. I understand
that this is against the open source policy. But that's how it is
and it is beyond my control. Is there any way to export only
selected symbols as required by insmod ? As of now I am not worried
about ksymoops.
Thanks and regards,
