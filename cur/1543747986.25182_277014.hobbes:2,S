That is fully correct and also something that eg the bouncing code needs
to be 100% deadlock free.

The mempools are needed, the duplicated slabs are not. But that's just a
small part of it, basically the whole allocation and index stuff is 100%
duplicated from bio.c. Even bio_init().

An abstraction for this would be nice, as there are two users of it then
(dm-io and highmem.c). So if your team would do that, I would sure help
you review and integrate it.
That's not what I'm arguing against, it's the (almost) wholesale
duplication that's a bit silly.
