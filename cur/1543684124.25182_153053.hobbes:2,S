parport uses 5V (actually a little less) so if you
use normal (not extra super duper bright) leds and
put a 1kOhm resistor in front of each led, then it
will drain 5mA per led, which gives a total of 40mA
for eight leds (for example)
now for the parport: depending on the technology
and the age of the circuit, it provides between
2 and 14mA output at >2.4V (the led usually requires
less than 1.5V to operate) so this would be within
the range ... but, if you want either extra brightness
or extra security, you could provide +5V and use
the outputlines as sink, which then is between
15 and 25mA ...
anyway, parport should be short circuit safe, so
the worst what could happen is, that the leds are
not working ;) ...
HTH,
Herbert
PS: I usually use 220Ohm and no external power ...
