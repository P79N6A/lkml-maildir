Yes, but this is irrelevant to *MY* point... this discussion spawned a
side discussion, and somehow you're upset that it's not addressing your
concern but a different one... seems a bit ridiculous!
Anyway, I already posted that if we're adding MAP_MAXADDR we could also
add MAP_MAXADDR_ADVISORY or something similar to that.  On the other
hand, how big of a performance issue is it really to call mmap() again
in the failure scenario *only*?
