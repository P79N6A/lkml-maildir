I do but besides that there is still data loss involved and my time is
expensive and limited, so I'd rather go for a hasslefree solution than
to poke around in mud with a stick in the hope it might clear up.

Very practicable advise.

The point is that until you know whether it really was the firmware,
you've spend so much time that it is much easier to return the drive.

A faulty drive is a faulty drive and thus qualifies for a
free replacement (at least in Germany). Nobody here can force
you to try several costly things which might solve the problem;
it is rather the manufacturers duty to fix it on their cost.

Very doubtful considering past experience. Also it's not very
probable (though it has happened) to receive a disk which is
more broken than broken.
