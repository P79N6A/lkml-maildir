>> One if my users cannot access directories that belong to a group he actually _is_ a member of. That, however, is true only when accessing them over NFS. On the local file system, everything is fine. UIDs and GIDs are the same on client and server, so that cannot be the problem. Client and server run Gentoo Linux with kernel 2.6.16 on the server and 2.6.17 on the client.

Ahh, no.  None of the NFS protocols define anything about the authentication
protocols.  This is defined by the RPC protocol and it defines a limit of 16
for AUTH_SYS, otherwise known as AUTH_UNIX.
Interestingly, the original NFSv2 implementations had a limit of 8, then 10,
and then finally 16.
    Thanx...
