Which I hardly see as real pain for filenames, especially as I covered
the backward compatibility bit anyway, and wanting to expand beyond
2^31 characters isn't really on my to-do list at the moment, which
just leaves filename bloat, which is laughably trivial in at least
99.9% of cases, and probably just a minor inconvenience the other
0.1%.
But, I don't think I care anymore, anyway, clearly we are going to end
up with UTF-8 filenames everywhere, and security vulnerabilities to go
with them, and as long as I'm aware of that fact, I should be OK.
John.
