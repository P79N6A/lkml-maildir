I have been thinking on how to deal with this as well. In do_con_write it
breaks up the writes into CON_BUF_SIZE. During each loop we could test for
current->need_sched. Break the lock if needed and schedule() then reset
the console lock. To prevent lost messages we could even use the
con_task_queue.
Q: Why did they deprecate a.out support in linux?
A: Because a nasty coff is bad for your elf.
