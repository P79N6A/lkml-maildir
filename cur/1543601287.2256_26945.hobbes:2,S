Huh? WTF does a patch to the locking code have to do with init?
That particular code is only called if something closes a file on
which POSIX locks are applied. Init doesn't use locking.
The patch *is* required in Alan's tree. Without it, 2 processes that
lock the same file can race and corrupt the i_flock list.
Cheers,
