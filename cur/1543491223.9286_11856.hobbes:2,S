Well, if you instist on making the additional requirement that anyone
using GNU tools must add GNU/ to whatever they produce (I see that nowhere
in the GPL, BTW, where did that requirement come from?) I think you may
find that it is a temporary problem and people with either endevor to make
other tools without such restrictions or port existing tools without such
restrictions to their systems in order to be truely free.
