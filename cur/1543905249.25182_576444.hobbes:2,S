Probably a similar problem is described in the
linux-ide mailing list a while ago:

At least it is a similar motherboard that is used
(however I have explicitly have the A8N-E Deluxe
edition).
I try not to repair my SATA disk for now with the
Seatools, so if there is some testing to be done, I
can run it with the bad disk.
