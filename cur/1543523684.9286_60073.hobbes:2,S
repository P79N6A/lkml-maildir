I agree that this (essentially useless) piece of code should
be taken out. However, I don't think this will fix the problem.
The real problem most likely hits when we're calling schedule()
to let kswapd do its job or when we're freeing pages ourselves
(and have to wait for I/O or cannot immediately grab the kernel
lock that's needed for do_try_to_freepages()).
