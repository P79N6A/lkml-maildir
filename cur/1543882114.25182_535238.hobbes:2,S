Will discuss in irc since you've appeared there...

Well uswsusp would benefit from using multiple threads - if it can - to
do the work. I saw quite an improvement from implementing it.

Did you see the 'Reasons to merge' email I sent? It has more detail on
this.

this in kernelspace makes far more sense' perspective.
