You're right, of course. We're replacing all page tables by then.

I didn't say I was sure either, but it is supposed to, I believe.

I was hoping there was something higher-level that had that info available...

  PM> Do you stop all user processes before doing resume, for example?
(Different subject, hey?-). No, I don't. At the point I do (and recommend to)
swapon is during early init processing. There are no user processes at that
point. If they are, they disappear in thin air at that point...
But I already gave up, I agree w/your method. But remember that people will
boot resume=/bla even when they have no swap to resume from. Just a lilo thing,
unavoidable.

Nope, that can't happen. uhci and bash had their pages neatly restored...
Wait! Are you saying you start uhci/netdrivers/enable interrupts BEFORE
resuming?? Nonono! Forbidden! Disk corruption, or your computer may explode!
(Apart from the explosions, all that seems to routinely happen in swsusp-2.4 ;-)

Why? You have the major/minor! (Remember you got the user to tell you).
Looks easy from here (I'm not looking at the code right now :-)
  PM> [swsusp list no longer works, doing cc to l-k.]
So it seems. It didn't bounce yesterday, but didn't get a response. OTOH, l-k
isn't too busy a place to discuss swsusp? How about the ACPI list?
(BTW, I'm not subscribed to l-k. But I can read the archives...)
