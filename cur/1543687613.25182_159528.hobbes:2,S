 What an interesting "design" of hardware trying to fit some version of
software.  Do you know if the key behaves consitently if either or both
<LAlt> and <LShift> are already depressed?  And do cursor/editor keys work
properly while <Switch_window> is depressed?  Can I unambiguosly map the
sequence the key generates e.g. to a "Multi_key" keysym? :->
