That puts the burden of tracking skb allocations and all that on the
fast path.
The 'simplicity' of my current approach is that we only start
bean-counting (and incur the overhead thereof) once we need it.

Dude, breathe, these boxens of yours will never swap over network simply
because you never configure swap. 
And, _no_, it does not necessarily mean global serialisation. By simply
saying there must be N pages available I say nothing about on which node
they should be available, and the way the watermarks work they will be
evenly distributed over the appropriate zones.

/me confused, I already have!
If you talk about the IRIX model, I'm very hestitant to do that simply
because that would incur the bean-counting overhead on the normal case
and that will greatly upset the network people - nor would that mean
that I don't need this stricter PF_MEMALLOC behaviour.
