2.2.18 is still broken, won't play NFSv3 games with FreeBSD clients.
Neil has posted a patch here which fixes this.
And, ReiserFS messes NFSv3 up, I'm currently switching all my boxes back
to ext2, because I'm really pissed. And if these NFS annoyances
continue, it might be about time to try FreeBSD or NetBSD. Journalling
file systems which hide their files away for maintainer incompetence and
uncoordinated patching around don't buy us anything except continued
"don't use Linux as NFS server" reputation.
