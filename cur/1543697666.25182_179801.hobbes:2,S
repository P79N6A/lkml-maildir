	Don't get me wrong, PCI-CardBus add-on cards seem to always be
a pain, whereas laptop seems to always have the right magic. I already
tried unsuccessfully to add a TI PCI-Pcmcia on another box, and this
was similar, whereas my laptops are always working out of the box.
	If you wonder why I'm doing that, well, there is not many SMP
laptops to try wireless driver on ;-)
