This has come up before a few times. The concensus seems to be that the PCI
fixup code for Serverworks chipsets is currently broken (and it's less simple to
fix than it should be due to lack of documentation - there have been some
educated guesses but it would be nicer to know for sure). The suggestion was
to simply kill the fixup code and believe the BIOS (i.e. kill the relevant
lines in the pcibios_fixups[] array in arch/i386/kernel/pci-pc.c). That has
worked on the systems I'm using that use the Serverworks chipset.
