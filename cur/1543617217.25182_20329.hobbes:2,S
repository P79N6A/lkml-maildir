The phrase "get a root" is entertainingly ambiguous in this context, is it not?
Storytelling is the most effective form of exposition.  It's a way to pull
technical issues out of the realm of abstraction, and help designers 
realize that there are (at least potentially) real people involved.
I recommend it.  Not just for communicating with others, but for your
own thought experiments in design.

Let us hope our weapons are never needed --but do not forget what 
the common people knew when they demanded the Bill of Rights: An 
armed citizenry is the first defense, the best defense, and the 
final defense against tyranny.
   If guns are outlawed, only the government will have guns. Only 
the police, the secret police, the military, the hired servants of 
our rulers.  Only the government -- and a few outlaws.  I intend to 
be among the outlaws.
