How about spinlocks? Does it make sense to make the contention code use 
mwait too, or are the latencies too high? Not that we have a lot of 
high-contention locks any more, so maybe it doesn't much matter.
Also, wasn't there some flag to set the "mwait" granularity? I don't see 
anything like that in the patch..
