OK, here is a modified version of the patch to CodingStyle which
explicitly notes the reason for this secondary style.

 and it gets confused.  You know you're brilliant, but maybe you'd like
 to understand what you did 2 weeks from now. 
 
+Function declarations should be new-style:
+
+int foo(long bar, long baz, struct magic *xyzzy)
+
+or when replacing old-style declarations which have comments:
+
+int foo(
+	long bar,
+	long baz,
+	struct magic *xyzzy	/* essential comment */
+)
+
+Old-style function declarations are deprecated:
+
+int foo(bar, baz, xyzzy)
+long bar, baz;
+struct magic *xyzzy;		/* essential comment */
