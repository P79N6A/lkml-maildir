Well, either the warning is _really_ important. Then it is not really
warning, but a fatal problem, and we should panic for it (so that user
sees the message) and ask for a command line option (so we really
really know user wants to ignore that warning).
Or it is important but not _that_ important. We have
printk(KERN_EMERG) for that.
Or maybe it is not so important. We have printk(KERN_WARNING) for
that.
Pick one, but doing "KERN_WARNING" level with message
"************************* I'm extremely important warning,
************************** uhuh maybe there is something bad in your
bios but I'm not really sure" is just wrong.
