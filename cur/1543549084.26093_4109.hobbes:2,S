Hi,

Small question: Is there any other situation, where pages are not uptodate 
and not locked, beside of read errors? In that case what about using a
similiar strategy like other fs (internal) errors -> set it readonly.
That would make pages always uptodate and changes could never be written
back. On the other hand the effect on mmap is still a bit unclear...
bye, Roman
