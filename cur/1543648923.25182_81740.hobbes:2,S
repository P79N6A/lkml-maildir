Humm, OKey chief, but the rest of the kernel in this case would be just
ip_proc, but I see, having it exported may well lead to someone to use it for
other purposes, ok, ok, back to work.
I'll start with fib, as it was not merged yet and its a fix that has to get in.
What about the CONFIG_IP_PROC_FS idea? Does it sounds reasonable or is it utter
crap? :-)
