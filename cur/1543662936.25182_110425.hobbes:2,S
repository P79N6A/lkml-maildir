  Some of my colleques complained once, that at full tilt
  the fiber-channel fabric overflowed its SNMP bitcounters
  every 2 seconds.
  "we need to do polling more rapidly, than the poller can do"
  The SNMP pollers do handle gracefully 32-bit unsigned overlow,
  they just need to get snapshots in increments a bit under 2G...
  (Hmm.. perhaps I remember that wrong, a bit under 4G should be ok.)
