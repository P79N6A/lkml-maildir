Its called "caution". It's why nobody does innovation in the USA any
more, its too dangerous to innovate. Far better to make it available as
before with a blue led and a beeper.

The big question seems to be about the standard itself. Are the items at
issue hardware or software ? We already deal with a lot of devices that
have hardware related patent pools and those by themselves don't seem to
cause problems.
In the mean time I guess the guys down in Bristol[1] will be feeling
happier and happier at the Infiniband self destruct sequence.
