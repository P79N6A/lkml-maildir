Tasks are added to the end of waitqueue->task_list through
add_wait_queue_exclusive, and waken up from the start of the list. So
I don't think that can happen (its FIFO).

The notification is sent once the VM starts moving anonymous pages to
the inactive list (meaning there is memory shortage). So polling on the
device is all about waiting for memory shortage.
Or do you mean something else?
