List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

James
we are planning a major rewrite of the zfcp driver, 
meaning that a lot of patches will hit the mailing-list in the near future.
Since I can't support this additional work-load along with my other 
responsibilities we are shifting the maintainership to
Christof Schmitt as the maintainer and
Martin Peschke as the co-maintainer.
Please support the two in providing us a new and more stable
zfcp environment.
Thanks
Swen
