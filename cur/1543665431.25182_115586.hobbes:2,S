along the same lines if you don't like klibc you are free to use or
implement dietlibc or anything else.

This was very much not intended to start a flamewar (and I do apologize if
anyone was offended by the post), but I think the very real fear of
oversealous GPL defenders is a large part of the reason why a modified GPL
was not chosen. The basic GPL was not chosen becouse the people
implementing klibc decided that the benifits of allowing propriatary code
outweighted the drawbacks as far as they are concerned.
I would love to see a lightweight libc that I could use for firewall
proxies and similar things that I have the source for but the license is
not GPL. The firewall toolkit proxies are an example, with libc5 I used to
put all the ones I used on a floppy to move them from one machine to
another, compiling with glibc there are some that won't fit on a floppy by
themselves, no functionality was gained in the process (and there is a
machine sitting under my desk that has a flash drive in it that I can't
use becouse they won't fit on it). it looks like klibc stands a good
chance of providing this.
