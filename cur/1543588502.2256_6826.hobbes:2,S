Subject: Help Need on after compile the Kernel
hi,
   after completed update from 2.2.17 to 2.4.3 manually, I have a
question
where can I find the file name 'kernel.h-2.4.3' than can be use to link
from 'kernel.h
and the 'module-info-2.4.3' which can link from 'module-info-2.2.17-14'
I am current unable to find this two on my system with the use of
'locate'
and 'find'
how do I creat this two file ?, it seem I having problem start up, my
NIC
failure I belive
it maybe casue by this two file.
regards
L J
