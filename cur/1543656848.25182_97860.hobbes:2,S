Subject: [PATCH] fix bug in scripts/kallsyms.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

kallsyms.c generates the symbol table in a .S file using the assembler .string 
macro.  Unfortunately, the .string macro is implemented in a platform specific 
way (it may or may not zero terminate the string).  On parisc, it doesn't zero 
terminate, so the symbol table search doesn't work.
The solution is to replace .string with .asciz which is guaranteed to do the 
correct thing on all platforms.
