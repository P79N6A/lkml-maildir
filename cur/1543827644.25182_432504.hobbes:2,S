It's fairly trivial with a decent MTA. I use all kinds of conditions to
trigger greylisting -- HTML mail, 'Re:' in subject with no References:,
lack of reverse DNS or CSA on the sending host, >=0.1 SA points, etc.
Adding "is not subscribed to the mailing list they're trying to post to"
should be trivial.
