Let me show what I got with the 2.4.2 kernel with USB support enabled.

This happens after simply fiddling around with ethernet settings (it's a
PCI ethernet card).  In fact, my syslog is FULL of these messages... my
syslog was 3x larger than usual.  The console is just about unusable
because of all the spam.
Something seems terribly wrong with the uhci driver... I've disabled it
on my system and it's fine now (I don't need USB).
My system:
Slot 1 P3-850
VIA chipset MB (not sure of exact chipset, can find out if needed)
