Subject: [PATCH] Avoid potential NULL deref in scripts/genksyms/lex.l
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/24/138

strchr() returns NULL in case the string is not found and if that 
happens we risk dereferencing a NULL pointer. It never hurts to 
check for that condition and exit normally with an error rather 
than crashing.
(no, the indentation is not according to CodingStyle, it's simply 
 following whatever else is in that file)
