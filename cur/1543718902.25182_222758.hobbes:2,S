A. o de Weegh,
We use a kernel patch called trustees to do just what you're talking 
about.  Unfortunately the patch hasn't really been kept up-to-date.  I 
wish something *like* this could be included in the standard kernel, but 
I guess I understand why it's not also.
Here's a link to trustees: 
http://trustees.sourceforge.net/
You could also use ACLs to give your teachers permissions, but that 
tends to take a lot of work imho, but it's what were looking at to 
replace trustees when I can no longer get it to patch into kernels.
Here's a link to Linux ACL:
