so what is your proposal then? Sorry, probably missed it due to lots of emails :)

do you mean that you prefer adding a explicit pointer to the structures
itself?

:) if we were to optimize for patch size then we would select vserver
approach and be happy...
Dave, we used to add UBC pointers on each data structure and then do
a separate accounting in the places where objects are allocated.
We spent a lot of time and investigation on how to make it better,
because it was leading to often accounting errors, wrong error paths etc.
The approach provided in this patchset proved to be much more efficient
and more error prone. And it is much much more elegant!
Thanks,
Kirill
