Maybe there is a less evil explanation for this?
This is hypothetical, but before people go off and do something rash,
perhaps IBM prevents the card from booting for a technical reason. Maybe
it works electrically but in late testing they found it caused thermal or
electrical problems.
A quick fix would be to put a "do-not-boot" clause in the BIOS so the user
doesn't cook their machine.
Just a perspective from a (former) hardware person.
