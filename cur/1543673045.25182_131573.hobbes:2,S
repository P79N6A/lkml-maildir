Could you please stop making random accusations? Pavel probably has
better things to do than to write a 'BK virus'. And about that comment
'taking steps to make sure CVS data is safe'...

Hmm, let's see 
https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/rh73-errata-security.html
Remote vulnerabilities for at least, CVS, OpenSSH, OpenSSL, Sendmail,
Apache, Samba, and MySQL.
I sure hope Dave cared, because I wouldn't even consider plugging an
unpatched anything into the network in the first place. Let alone
announce this fact to a widely distributed mailing list.
Even without such a clear announcement any new machine that I connect is
typically portscanned within 30 minutes. Maybe the situation is worse at
CMU because CERT is in our address space or something, but still.
