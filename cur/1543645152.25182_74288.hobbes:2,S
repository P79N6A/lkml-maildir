Hello!
> suggest applies both to current code and code after Yoshi's change.
This is wrong, unfortunately. The elimination of ipv6_get_saddr()
was trivial before this patch (because of independance of preferred source
on real destination, only on scope), the corresponding fix was withdrawn
from 2.4 only for sake of this feature, pending as a well-known patch.
Now I see retransmission of practicllay the same patch, which was deferred
for improvement that time.
