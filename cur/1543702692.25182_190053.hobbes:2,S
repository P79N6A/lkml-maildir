2.4.19-rmk7, 24.4.21-rmk1-pxa1, 2.6.0-rmk2-pxa. All self-compiled with
self-ported platform-specific patches. Sure, none of those patches touches
any NFS / network general code. It might modify some (including network)
drivers, and, of course the core functionality (interrupt-handling,
memory, DMA, etc.) The first 2 also had real-time patches (RTAI), 2.6 on
PXA didn't. The pxa-patch for 2.6 was self-ported from 2.6.0-rmk1-test2,
IIRC. So, theoretically, you can blame any of those modifications, but I
highly doubt, that I managed to mess up all 3 kernels on 2 different
platforms to produce the same error, whereas all the rest (of course,
those, that I checked, i.e. ftp, http, telnet, tftp, tcp-nfs) network
protocols work.
