My shame at responding to your post is surpassed only by my rage at

I don't know what all this is about, but phrased as "Red Hat aggresively
incorporates new Free Software into their products" it sounds rather
nicer.

No.  There is a philosophy surrounding Linux and Unix, and your refusal
even to try to appreciate it loses you the ears of many here who would
otherwise offer useful help and insight.
Given the regard in which Alan, Linus, et. al. are help on these lists,
calling them "second rate unix hackers" would lose you friends even if
it were true.
What did anybody at all gain from your posting this vague, unsubstantiated
(hell, it's so content-free as to be basically un_in_stantiated, too)
attack to the list?

Watch NT4 boot.  Go on.  SP3 claims to be build 1381 or something
(apologies, it's been a long time since I last had to use NT).  Just
how many of the the 1378 builds which didn't see the light of day
broke something or caused massive fs corruption?

Alan is a very nice guy, with basically infinite patience for those
who are prepared usefully to help themselves.  Many of the others on
the list are the same.

The details may change, but the intentions remain largely the same.
Maybe the NT people got their VFS right in NT4 and didn't have to
change it for W2K.  Good for them.
This is Linux, though.  We don't have to get everything right the
first time.  Once it exists, people use it.  Then we make it better.
Think of it as pipelining.
From your descriptions, the 2.3 VFS looks /more/ like NT's.  How that
makes your work harder (given that you clearly favour that platform)
I have no idea.

So *fuck off*.  Many people might like to use your nwfs, but when
you persist in so fundamentally and rudely misunderstanding Linux
development, you repel them.
> And get over it, would you.
How *dare* you?  You posted a bizarre rant attacking Alan for some
perceived injustice inflicted upon you by his employers.  You may
have interest in Linux.  You may release bits of source code.  But
you patently have no interest in the development of Linux, so you
have no place here.
Please desist from posting your vitriol to this list.
Matthew.
