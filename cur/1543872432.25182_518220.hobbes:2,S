The real issue seems to be the assumption in pm_prepare_console() that
set_console() will succeed.  set_console() may fail (resulting in
vt_waitactive waiting for a console switch that can never happen or a
break) for two currently unchecked reasons:
- console is in VT_AUTO+KD_GRAPHICS mode
- vt_dont_switch is set

QPE doesn't need to repaint the screen after wake-up - the framebuffer
memory is retained so the PXA270 lcd controller simply displays what was
last on the screen when it is re-enabled.
