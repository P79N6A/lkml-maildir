My Aironet 350 PCMCIA card works fine with 2.4.20 and hasn't worked with vanilla
2.4.21  or 2.4.22 (with Debian patches). I've got a Dell Latitude with a 1.2GHz
mobile P3.
Here is what appears in my /var/log/syslog when I plug the card into the laptop.

At this point, the system ignores the keyboard. Otherwise, the system is
responsive to my USB mouse and X11 continues responding.
