Subject: Incoming TCP TOS: A simple question, I would have thought...

I've scrolled through various code in net/ipv4, and I can't see how to query 
the TOS of an incoming TCP stream (or at the least, the TOS of the SYN which
initiated the connection).
Someone has sent in a feature request for squid which would require this, 
presumably so they can set the TOS in their routers and have the squid caches
honour the TOS to select performance (via delay pools, multiple parents,
different outgoing IP or similar).  However I can't see how to get the TOS for
a TCP socket out of the kernel short of having an open raw socket watching for
SYNs and looking at the TOS on them.
Any pointers?
David.
