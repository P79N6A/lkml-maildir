The machine is a Pentium 166 that is *NOT* overclocked.  (I installed the chip
myself and made sure it was at the correct speed and voltage from the board.)

What is the correct length?  (The cable is not that long (maybe 2 feet, if
that). It is connected correctly.)
I saw another post on weirdnesses with the via chipset.  Since I believe that
is what I have on that board I am going to investigate that route further.
