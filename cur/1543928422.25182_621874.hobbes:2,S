Hi Ingo... any hope of an updated realtime patch for 2.6.22.14? I'm
having problems with 2.6.23.1 + rt11 (I spent the morning rediffing
agains 2.6.23.9 and just _now_ pressed reload in my browser and there it
is..., rt12 for 2.6.23.9!, argh! :-) and wanted to compare with 2.6.22.x
and the latest I managed to repatch and run successfully is 2.6.22.10. I
did 2.6.22.14 in the afternoon but I obviously bungled it somewhere as
the boot... takes... a... long... time... I can send my .14 patch off
the list if you want/need it. 
[in my 2.6.23.1-rt11 tests I am getting "delayed..." messages from
jackd, smells like a problem with internal timing in the kernel]
I'll try rt12...
