Yes, by all means, punish the user as much as possible.  They certainly
deserve all of the pain we can heap upon them.  Why not hook up some
electrodes to the speaker and give them a few hundred volts when they make
a typing error as well?
It is perfectly possible to handle this kind of thing on PC hardware, as
evidenced by other operating systems that do it.  If it's too hard for
Linux then fine, but that should be admitted fairly instead of just saying
the user is an idiot for wanting it.
