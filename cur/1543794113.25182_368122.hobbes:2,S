There is probably a lot of other grot like this in various drivers.
The amazing thing about this is that all of these drivers getting
snuffed up by VM_RESERVED issues are trying to do essentially the
same thing.  They want to allocate some buffers, which the device
can DMA into and out of, and mmap() those buffers into user space
in some sane way.
The video capture driver layer drivers/media/video/video-buf.c is
probably the best known example, and all the other copies in the
tree of this logic is some derivative.
Note also that the AF_PACKET mmap() facility (in
net/packet/af_packet.c) does this VM_RESERVED stuff, but I think since
it never does the get_user_pages() bit like the video capture drivers
do, it didn't trigger any of the new messages or BUG() traps.
I say "I think" because I haven't tested this stuff out specifically.
