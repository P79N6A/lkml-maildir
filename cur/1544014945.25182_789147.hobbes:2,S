If you are adding userspace apis, please also add the proper
documentation to Documentation/ABI/ as well.

How does userspace know if it is implemented or not?

timer.ko is a pretty generic name for a module, how about changing it to
something a bit more unique and descriptive?

Where are these files located at?
And can't you do this already with the existing kernel/user interfaces
for time?  What is different here from them?  The PWM signal?  Or
something else?

Do you really mean "any later version"?

Please don't put #ifdefs in c files if at all possible.

Don't we already have this define in some .h file somewhere?

<snip>
You can do all the creation and deletion of files using a group of
attributes, which would make your code much simpler.

That sounds pretty generic :(
