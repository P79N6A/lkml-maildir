Look at atomic read :
$ emacs `find /usr/src/linux/include -name atomic.h | xargs`

Atomic inc/dec/add/sub are different to read/write an aligned sizeof(int)
memory location. An aligned sizeof(int) read/write must be atomic for the
bare bone CPU memory coherency. While add/sub/add/inc are (or at least can
be) split in MEMOP(load)->ALUOP(?)->MEMOP(store) whose full cycle is not
guaranteed to be atomic, load/store of sizeof(int) aligned memory location
are not split is every CPU whose designer was not drunk during the
architectural phase. Or better, if they are split due some sort of HW
limitation, the HW itself has to guarentee the atomicity of the operation.
Intel tries also to guarantee the atomicity of non aligned load/store by
doing split locks on the memory bus. If you have :
int a;
thread1:
	for (;;)
		a = 1;
thread2:
	for (;;)
		a = -1;
being "a" an aligned memory location, a third thread reading "a" reads
either 1 or -1. Going back to the (doubtfully useful) code, you still have
to point out were it does bang ...
