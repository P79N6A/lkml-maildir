Subject: [PATCH 00/08] robust per_cpu allocation for modules - V2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/14/194

This is version 2 of the percpu patch set.
Changes from version 1:
- Created a PERCPU_OFFSET variable to use in vmlinux.lds.h
  (suggested by Sam Ravnborg)
- Added support for x86_64 (Steven Rostedt)
The support for x86_64 goes back to the asm-generic handling when both
CONFIG_SMP and CONFIG_MODULES are set. This is due to the fact that the
__per_cpu_offset array is no longer referenced in per_cpu, but instead a
per per_cpu variable is used to find the offset.
Again, the rest of the patches are only sent to the LKML.
Still I need help to port this to the rest of the architectures.
Thanks,
-- Steve
