yes it is, and each type of device is growing it's own, incompatible, 
interfaces for controlling things like this. I was aiming to do two 
things.
1. head this off and try and get a more common api
2. simplify the confusion that there is with multiple functions needing to 
be implemented during the suspend/resume cycle by chaning them from 
independant suspend-only functions to being just part of the device 
settings
