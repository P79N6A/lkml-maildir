     I grabbed 2.10d, installed the disk-utils portion and the swapon program. 
Didn't do a full install because it would hose other aspects of my userland
environment. 
     Now I can't seem to create a swap partition that I can swapon at all.
     The swapon system call returns EINVAL; but it IS a block special device,
so I don't know what's wrong now.  If I dd one of the old swap devices onto
the new device, then I CAN mount it would tells me it's something in the device
that mkswap wrote that it doesn't like, but it explodes even if I tell to use
the old -v0 version.
