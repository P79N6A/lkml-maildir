I had no more information, the system just hung after the `hda:' line. Setting
the
bios to interrupts triggered by `level' seems to get things going in my case.
I guess these are workarounds rather than solutions. I was just happy to
get the system booted. It seems that we can reproduce this particular problem,
and I'd be glad to participate in any testing that might assist Andre's efforts.
Thanks,
Joe
