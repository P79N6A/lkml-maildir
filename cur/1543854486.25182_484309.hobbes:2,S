It can and does happen.  -Which- definition of mb()?  ;-)
To see how this can happen, thing of the SMP system as a message-passing
system, and consider the following sequence of events:
o	The cache line for A is initially in CPU 1's cache, and the
	cache line for B is initially in CPU 0's cache (backwards of
	what you would want knowing about the upcoming writes).
o	CPU 0 stores to A, but because A is not in cache, places it in
	CPU 0's store queue.  It also puts out a request for ownership
	of the cache line containing A.
o	CPU 1 stores to B, with the same situation as for CPU 0's store
	to A.
o	Both CPUs execute an mb(), which ensures that any subsequent writes
	follow the writes to A and B, respectively.  Since neither CPU
	has yet received the other CPU's request for ownership, there is
	no ordering effects on subsequent reads.
o	CPU 0 executes "b = B", and since B is in CPU 0's cache, it loads
	the current value, which is zero.
o	Ditto for CPU 1 and A.
o	CPUs 0 and 1 now receive each other's requests for ownership, so
	exchange the cache lines containing A and B.
o	Once CPUs 0 and 1 receive ownership of the respective cache lines,
	they complete their writes to A and B (moving the values from the
	store buffers to the cache lines).

See above...
