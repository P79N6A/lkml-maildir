Sorry, looks "a bit" more complex. And quoting you "Confirmed. I'd
classify this as a fairly serious bug. I am currently testing the
following fix."
I can confirm that Red Hat 7.3 latest gcc errata fixes (issued 13
months later) indeed generates correct code for at least
__ntfs_init_inode() with Randy's .config file. The compiler version,
% gcc --version
2.96
Oops, not to talkative considering how heavily patched ...
% rpm -qf =gcc
gcc-2.96-113
gcc generated code from Mandrake 9.1 RC2 is also ok.
% gcc --version
gcc (GCC) 3.2.2 (Mandrake Linux 9.1 3.2.2-2mdk)
