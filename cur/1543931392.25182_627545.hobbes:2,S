Probably should be. The patch only reverts the change for
handle_simple_irq that shouldn't have been done in the first place. At
worse, this patch just takes us back to what handle_simple_irq use to do,
and at best, it prevents bugs where we somehow fall into the "mask" path
of handle_simple_irq and never unmask. But to hit that path, the driver
probably shouldn't be using handle_simple_irq ;-)
