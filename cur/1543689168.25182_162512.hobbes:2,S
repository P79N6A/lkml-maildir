multi node yes, numa not much and where numa-like systems are being used
they are being used for message passing not as a fake big pc. 
Numa is valuable because
- It makes some things go faster without having to rewrite them
- It lets you partition a large box into several effective small ones 
  cutting maintenance
- It lets you partition a large box into several effective small ones
  so you can avoid buying two software licenses for expensive toys
if you actually care enough about performance to write the code to do
the job then its value is rather questionable. There are exceptions as
with anything else.
