You misquote me.  I do agree that the first sentence is in reference to
source code.  :)  It's the rest that talks about complete source.  But I'm
not particularly interested in this.  What interests me is who defines
``preferred form''.  Some people argue that it is the author.  If so then
what are the safeguards to prevent the author from selecting binary as
their preferred source form for modifications?  It seems to me that the
FSF really meant some sort of community or industry preferred form.
