I sent this Oops message to the list several weeks ago, but haven't heard
any replies yet. I'd just like to clarify a few points:
- It's not a termination problem.
- It's not a cable-length problem.
- The hardware (seems to) work fine in W*n98
- I also tried kernel 2.2.10-ac8, to the same effect.
Again, any help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
My original message is included below.

Subject: Oops in 2.2.10 with AHA-2940U2W SCSI, Yamaha 4416s CDRW
Hi.
I'm having the following problems with a Yamaha 4416s CDRW drive in
conjunction with an Adaptec 2940 U2W SCSI controller:
When I attempt to mount the drive, I get numerous timeout errors (shown
below), usually but not always followed by a kernel panic. Occasionally
the mount is successful, and I can list files in the root directory of the
CD, but if I try to list sub-directories I get the same problem.
The oops occurs in the function aic7xxx_handle_scsiint, specifically at
the line 6197:
          if (scb->cmd == p->dev_dtr_cmnd[TARGET_INDEX(scb->cmd)])
(see below for more info)
I'm using kernel 2.2.10, glibc2.1, egcs-2.91.66 on a modified redhat5.1.
I've updated the aha2094 to bios v2.11.0
MoBo: A-Open AX59Pro with AMD K6-2 300Mz
I don't seem to have any IRQ conflicts.
I am not on the kernel mailing list (I apologize if this is bad form), so
I would appreciate a CC of any responses. Please let me know if any more
information is required. Any help in this matter would be greatly
appreciated.
Thank you,
Ben Lewis.
