Greetings;
I just now rebooted to 2.6.9-rc2-mm2 after making an unrelated 
adjustment to my modprobe.conf, trying to get the pl2303 module to 
autoload on boot.  That didn't work either, but I can modprobe it in 
by hand and that seems to do it.
But as it was rebooting, I saw this go by in my dmesg:
CacheFS: Wrong magic number on cache
and there appears to be no further references to it.
I don't recall seeing that msg before now, and it has been turned on 
in the kernels I'm building for quite a while.  I probably haven't 
properly init'd it or something equally dumb as I don't think there 
is a line in my /etc/fstab for it.  So what should that line look 
like from a copy/paste from somebody elses /etc/fstab that has it 
working?
Humm, I just read Documentation/cachefs.txt, and I see it wasn't what 
I had in mind from the description at all.  And rather than try and 
setup all that, I think I might take it back out of the kernel here 
unless someone can show a good example of how to use it, to take the 
pressure off of /swap for instance.  Or could it even be made to do 
that?
TIA
