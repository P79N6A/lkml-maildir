Depends what you mean by "system locks".  The invalidate_bdev() problem
won't lock the machine.  Its symptoms are merely that the ioctl will
not terminate until the process which is writing to disk stops.
In other words: if you run dbench, then lilo, lilo will not complete
until after dbench terminates.
If you're seeing actual have-to-hit-reset lockups then that'll
be due to something quite different.
