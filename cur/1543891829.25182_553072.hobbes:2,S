I must admit I don't know much about that topic, but there is one thing I 
don't understand. Why is iperf (even if it's buggy) able to use up the whole 
cpu? I didn't run it as root but as my normal user so it should have limited 
rights. Shouldn't the linux scheduler distribute cpu time among all running 
processes?
