Yup, I agree and will follow in future.

Nope, this is not a bug. Adding a comment patch which explains the same.

It was getting called from only one place free_iova().

Nope. IOVA are valid only for the duration of DMA MAP and DMA UNMAP calls.
In case of Intel-iommu driver, the iova's are valid only for the duration
of __intel_map_singl() and __intel_unmap_single() calls.

As explained above, iova are freed and reused again during the DMA map calls.

VT-d hardware(a.k.a Intel IOMMU hardware) page table size is always
4K irrespective of the OS PAGE_SIZE. We want to use the same code for 
IA64 too where the OS PAGE_SIZE may not be 4K size and hence
had to define here for IOMMU.

Fixed. Please see bleow patch.

Yup that is correct. We don;t support x86_32.

I am in the process of making the same code base to work for
IA64 architecure too and in this process I will do more cleanup.
Thanks.
Please apply the below patch as a fix the existing patch.
