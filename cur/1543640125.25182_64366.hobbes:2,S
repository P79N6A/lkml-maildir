I've been having a lot of problems with my Ultra 133 TX2 controller,
that if I boot my system a just doesn't touch it for a while, the system
suspends to complete standby, even though the ext3 data is committed
every 5 secs. causing disk activity and thus should disallow standby
behaviour (at least that's the way it works on my onboard controller).
This has been a problem for ages and I sinerely thought it had been
fixed in the 2.4.19 kernel, and so it seemed for a while, until it
happened again(guess i had to figure out to trigger it once again)
it seems the best way to spot it is to leave the system alone completely,
after a boot - then just wait for an apm standby event to happen.
Any thoughts on this problem?
Best regards
Thomas
