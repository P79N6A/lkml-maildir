I hope that I am researching the appropriate kernel source tree, but if I 
am not mistaken, this behaviour was introduced with change 1.66 according 
to bitkeeper:
  
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.6/net/ipv4/udp.c?PAGE=history
I think the bitkeeper comment on that change (1.66) is misleading:
  "[UDP]: Return true length if user specifies MSG_TRUNC."
As you said, this is wrong. The true length is returned, regardless 
whether the user specified MSG_TRUNC.
Exploring this topic I learned a lot about browsing and reading kernel 
source code, e.g. that commit statements have to be taken with a grain of 
salt :-)
Cheers
Daniel
