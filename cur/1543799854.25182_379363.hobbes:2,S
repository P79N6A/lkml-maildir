Hi,
I am new to Linux kernel and now working on a project, which tries to
modifies the kernel a little bit and get some blocking information
about system calls. That is, if a system call gets blocked (put into
sleep), I want to know the "reason for sleep" and the "file name &
line number which causes the blocking".
I know that there are data structs in FreeBSD holding these
information, but I don't know if linux has the same facility
(functions / data structs). Hope someone can give me a hint.
Also, I wonder if ru_majflt in struct rusage (linux/resource.c) is
already implemented.
Thanks!
Yi
