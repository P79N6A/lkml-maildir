Which is why I, later in the same message, wrote:
Architecturally the easy-application-accessible switch should be something more than
a syscall to prevent a return-address-twiddle invoking the call directly.  I'd make
it a /proc/self something, or put it in a separate include-only-if-used shared
library or something.  If the minimal distance is opening and writing a
normally-untouched file then you get a nice support matrix.  (e.g. no file means no
feature, file plus action means executable stack, no action means system default (old
can, new cannot), hacks would require a variable (fd) and executing arbitrary code to
open and write that file, programs/programmers that want/need the old behavior can
achieve it without having to know how to manipulate their ELF headers or tool-chains,
etc.)
Which is not susceptible to the 1-2 attack you mention below because the open and
write cannot be done on a protected stack or heap, since it would then have to be
(er... ) executed to perform the hack.
Ahhhh, yes...

ahhhh no.
The first attack against a vulerable server  would be to load a string
on the stack that would:
1. have address of the syscall to turn off NX, then return to the stack.
2. have normal worm/virus code following.
