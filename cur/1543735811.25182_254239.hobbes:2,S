I do not know what the right solution is. ioctl() is ugly, passing
structures using write() is ugly, too. I think adding ioctl() to sysfs
is less dangerous, because writes can not be translated using compat
layer. Both solutions are ugly and you'll get flamed for both :-(.
Andrew, can you help? We want to call AML methods from userspace, and
defining interface is not fun.
