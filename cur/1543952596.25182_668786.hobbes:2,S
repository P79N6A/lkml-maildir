Well, what we did was to make readlink() return the pathname, and
open() return a dup of the filesystem.  I thought that was pretty
clever at the time, actually.
Yes, it wasn't completely the plan 9 semantics, but in terms of what
happened with when you opened the filesystem, it was equivalent to
dupfs.
Maybe our mistake was to make /dev/fd a symlink to /proc/self/fd, and
/dev/stdin a symlink to /proc/self/fd/0, et. al, since we don't get
the semantics exactly right compard to other operating systems.

What is the security problem that you are worried about?  That it
might leak the pathname to someone who had an open file handle to the
file?  That doesn't seem like a huge deal to me....

Yeah, ouch.  The only other way to do it would be to add a new
function pointer to the file_operations() field which would only be
used filled in by procfs inodes, and then have the sys_open() routine
call that function pointer if open() was zero.  But that would be
quite ugly....
