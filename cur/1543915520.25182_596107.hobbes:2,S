I will stop this idiotic thread.
However, at the VM and/or vm/fs things we had, I was happy enough
for this thing of Christoph's to get merged. Actually I even didn't care
if it had mmap support, so long as it solved their problem.
But a solution to the general problem of VM and IO scalability, it is not.
IMO.

Maybe. Maybe not.

Will do. Sorry.
