I am not sure, if we really need to vectorize this method or not - 
meaning will this be ever called
with more than one items in the vector. 
Micheal, is it possible ? Can some one directly use AIO interface on 
hypfs ? If not, we can always
look at only first element and ignore rest of them. Otherwise, we need 
to iterate on all the elements
of the vector.
Thanks,
Badari
