Subject: [patch 05/37] UML - host VDSO fix

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.

From: Jeff Dike <jdike@addtoit.com>
This fixes a problem seen by a number of people running UML on newer host
kernels.  init would hang with an infinite segfault loop.
It turns out that the host kernel was providing a AT_SYSINFO_EHDR of
0xffffe000, which faked UML into believing that the host VDSO page could be
reused.  However, AT_SYSINFO pointed into the middle of the address space, and
was unmapped as a result.  Because UML was providing AT_SYSINFO_EHDR and
AT_SYSINFO to its own processes, these would branch to nowhere when trying to
use the VDSO.
The fix is to also check the location of AT_SYSINFO when deciding whether to
use the host's VDSO.
