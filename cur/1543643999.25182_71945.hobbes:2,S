Im cautiously trusting it. I use it for day to day work but I do have 
backups.
- PIO mode has performance problems, especially hdparm -u0
- There are some crash corner cases left on load/unloads somewhere
- pcmcia hangs on card eject
- PIO taskfile write causes lots of missed IRQ but doesnt seem to lose
  data
- Something isnt 100% with the serverworks "dont UDMA on OSB4" logic
- Simplex controllers we dont run in DMA mode yet (mostly shows up on ALi)
