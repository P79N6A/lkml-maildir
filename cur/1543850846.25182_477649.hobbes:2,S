Yes, these are some of the inefficiencies that we're ironing out.

No. So the granularity at which you can divide up the system depends
on how big your fake nodes are. For our purposes, we figure that 64MB
granularity should be fine.

Yes - but PaulJ's recent patch to speed up the zone selection helped
reduce the overhead of this a lot.

Well, if the pages aren't mlocked then presumably some of the existing
pages can be flushed out to disk and replaced with other pages.

Right - I think it's an important feature to be able to support, but I
agree that it's not suitable for all situations.

Page cache control is actually more essential that RSS control, in our
experience - it's pretty easy to track RSS values from userspace, and
react reasonably quickly to kill things that go over their limit, but
determining page cache usage (i.e. determining which job on the system
is flooding the page cache with dirty buffers) is pretty much
impossible currently.
