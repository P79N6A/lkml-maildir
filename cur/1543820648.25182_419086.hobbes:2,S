I overlooked that reversal completely.  What a very good point.
I think that actually pte_clear() _does_ need to be redefined for PAE,
to reverse that ordering as you point out.  Take a look at its use in
mm/highmem.c (where a comment states it's safe against speculative
execution, but a comment can't guarantee that!): what do you think?
