The manpage editor, which is a completely different project than the
linux kernel itself. The manual pages are usually edited by the
distributions, so use the package manager for your distribution figure
out which manpage they belong to and file a patch/bug for the pages you
(dis)like:
  dpkg -S /usr/share/man/man4/ttyS.4.gz (debian based distros)
  rpm -qf /usr/share/man/man4/ttyS.4.gz (rpm based distros)
The distribution maintainer should take care of submitting the changes
upstream.

Kernel.org is for distribution of the linux kernel for use by
developers and advanced users. Joe Random User shouldn't be compiling
his kernel in the first place, so making kernel.org "user friendly"
doesn't serve any purpose. The amount of links on that particular page
also doesn't really need a structure, even Joe Random User would be
able to navigate it.

Manpages are userland stuff and therefore do not belong on kernel.org.
The kernel is documented in the Documentation/ directory in the source
tree, and ultimately in the source itself.
