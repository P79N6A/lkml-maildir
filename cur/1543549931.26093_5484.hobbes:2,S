The only thing I'm not sure is that I believe the SPARC people uses
ttyS* for Zilog 8530-based serial ports.  I don't know if we want to
define this as NS8250-family serial ports in light of that; I more
tended to think of it as the "default" serial port for the
architecture.
It's mostly up to the SPARC people, I guess...
