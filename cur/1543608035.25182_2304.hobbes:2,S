   I fail to follow you - yes, dev_alloc_name calls sprintf on it, but
   sprintf works fine on strings without "%d", and dev_alloc_name also works
   fine (despite a little suboptimal).
   
You're right, it should allow the "string has no '%' at all" case
as well.  Please, someone send me a patch which does this.
Franks a lot,
