We did do one chop, and concluded it wasn't the x86_64 patches.

It looks like a different panic to me. It was a double-fault before.

I can't do much from here - it's running on an IBM machine. Have to beg
Andy, or one of the other IBMers, for help.

It consistently happens on -mm, and not mainline, flicking back and 
forth over time. So if you mean h/w mem init, I don't think so. if you
mena some patch in -mm, then yes.

Yes, the other stuff might not be swapping.

Yeah, we have a sniff-testing mechanism that works well. However,
drill-down still requires significant amounts of human intervention.
The next gen of stuff should help do more intelligent stuff, but we're
kind of stuck with human-ness for now.
