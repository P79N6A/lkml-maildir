Interesting.  I thought maybe this way was trick, until later I experimented.
My post here (as Bill Stokes):

So what is the reason to doing !!num as opposed to num ? 1:0 (which is more 
readable I think, especially to a lesser experienced C coder).  Quicker to 
type?
My quick test shows compiler renders both the same?
