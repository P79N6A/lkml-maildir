Subject: Bug in sys_sched_yield

In the recent optimizations to sys_sched_yield a bug was introduced.
In the current implementation of sys_sched_yield()
the aligned_data and idle_tasks are indexed by logical cpu-#.
They should however be indexed by physical cpu-#.
Since logical==physical on the x86 platform, it doesn't matter there,
for other platforms where this is not true it will matter.
Below is the fix.
