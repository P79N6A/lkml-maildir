Subject: [PATCH 1/3] IRQ: add __must_check to request_irq
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/26/143

This could help to find buggy drivers where request_irq return value wasn't
checked. There's just no reason to ignore errors which can and do occur.
Anyone who got warning during compilation have to realise what it is't realy
safe code.
