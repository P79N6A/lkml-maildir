That's not a correction, it's a tangent!   Either way, it's still
"handy" ... since supporting new formats requires new tools, and it's
clearly "handy" not to need to write, debug, and deploy new tools
(including teaching, documenting, etc).

The "silly assumption" seems to be that the current "modules.*map"
format can reasonably be extended ... when no rules for extending those
file formats were really defined, and the _only_ precedent for even
changing them involved incompatibility between "versions".
I'd far rather have a decent file format for that data, and move
away from that ungainly syntax, than try to retrofit rules about
how to extend that syntax.  Such a format should:
  - allow comments
  - not have as much garbage (zeroes, 0xffffffff, etc)
  - still be easily parsable from shell scripts (*)
  - be easier for site admins to edit (insert vi/emacs flamewar)
  - have an explicit version code, and rules about evolution
Alternatively, the tried'n'true approach of coupling the format
to the filename works:  don't reuse "modules.*map", use "*.modules"
or something.

(*) This is the annoying requirement.  Maybe worth relaxing.
     For example, an XML format could easily support all the
     other requirements ... but not (AFAIK) that one.
