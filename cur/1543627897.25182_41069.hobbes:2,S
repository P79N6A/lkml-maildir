Exists already.  You may use hdparm to tell IDE drives
to spin up and down or even set a timeout.  This is
mostly for power-saving or no-noise setups.
So they could indeed add a jumper to IDE drives to let them
power up in the spun-down state.  But that's not what
the vast majority of one-disk users want.
