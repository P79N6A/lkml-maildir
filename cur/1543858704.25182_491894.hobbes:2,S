Huh?  What do you mean "don't use in band signaling"?  If you are asking 
how you issue AT commands to the modem while connected, you have to 
break to command mode.  IIRC, this involves sending a special break 
character or two with the correct delay between them, or flipping one of 
the RS232 handshake lines.
