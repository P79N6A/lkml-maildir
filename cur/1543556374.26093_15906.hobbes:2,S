P3/600 (Katmai, stepping 3), intel SR440BX mobo + latest BIOS, 128Mb; RH7 +
local updates (notably binutils-2.10.0.33-1).
2.2.18pre23: Machine was mostly idle (around 15:40, no users, running Gnome
+ screensaver). No response at all to mouse/keyboard (C-A-BS nor
C-A-DEL). No traces in the logs.
2.2.18pre24: Rebooted into 24, downloaded latest CVS update for gcc started
building, was reading email via emacs + mh-e in Gnome. Full freeze again.
First time this happens to me with this machine. Back to 2.2.18pre22 for
now.
