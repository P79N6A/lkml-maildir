IMHO this is way too complicated. Introducing a ptrace call that returns
the number of syscalls and forcing user space to pass a complete bitmask
is much easier. Also the semantics are much easier to understand.
In addition your proposal would already introduce a rather complicated
interface to figure out how many syscalls the kernel has. I'm sure this
will be (mis)used sooner or later.
