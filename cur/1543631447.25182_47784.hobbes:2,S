That's a nice argument in theory, but if you change the behaviour of
existing flags, you might fix some program for the real semantics, but you
might equally well _break_ some program that unwittingly depended on the
old semantics.
So I think your argument is fundamentally flawed. The binary has been
tested with the old behaviour, and assuming that you can "fix" existing
binaries by changing kernel behaviour is a seriously flawed argument.
Yes, it might work for some programs, but basically you're on very thin
ice.
Does Linux break stuff when absolutely required? Sure. But designing an
interface that _plans_ on changing semantics is just incredibly stupid,
and should absolutely not be done. Ever.
