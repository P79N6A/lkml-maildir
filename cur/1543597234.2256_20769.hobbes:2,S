That I can certainly reproduce.  Cerberus is also capable of
reproducing a stall after a few hours.  I'm usually seeing
create_buffers() as the place where the kswapd itself is deadlocked,
though.  
It does need a _really_ high load to trigger this, though.  A 200
client dbench won't do it --- there are too many IOs slowing each
process up.  However, Cerberus, which produces a high VM load in
parallel with the IO stress, seems pretty good at triggering the
problem.
It also does seem worse on highmem machines, almost certainly because
of zone imbalance problems: Marcelo has just started looking more
closely at that as a result of the fine-grained VM monitoring patch
(which showed clearly just how imbalanced the VM can get when you have
a highmem zone).

Yep, with GFP_NOFS I don't see any fs deadlocks, but I'm still seeing
the swapper blocked inside create_buffers (not within ext3 at all).
That's not good.
Cheers,
 Stephen
