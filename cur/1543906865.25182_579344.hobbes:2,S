...For me, I would say 50% is not enough to describe the _visible_ 
benefits... Not talking any specific number but past 10sec-1min+ lagging
in X is history, it's gone and I really don't miss it that much... :-) 
Cannot reproduce even a second long delay anymore in window focusing under 
considerable load as it's basically instantaneous (I can see that it's 
loaded but doesn't affect the feeling of responsiveness I'm now getting), 
even on some loads that I couldn't previously even dream of... I still
can get drawing lag a bit by pushing enough stuff to swap but still it's 
definately quite well under control, though rare 1-2 sec spikes in drawing 
appear due to swap loads I think. ...And this is 2.6.21.5 so no fancies 
ala Ingo's CFS or so yet...
...Thanks about this hint. :-)
