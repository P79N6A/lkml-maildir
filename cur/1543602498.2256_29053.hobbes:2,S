thanks
i could verify that it was a stackoverflow. but this was due to an 
unexpected behaviour of gcc not because of too may interrupts :) 
i realiesd that when i had a look at the assemby output of my code. 
i had a macro that defined its local variables (256 byte). this macro 
was used n times and gcc allocates n * 256 bytes at the function entry 
point also it actualy only needs 256 byte. is his allocation strategy 
not silly?
