Subject: msghdr problem in tcp_sendmsg

Hello!
I trace the kernel networking code (ver 2.4.25).
I send simple message (say, "hello") using simple client and see how tcp_sendmsg function works.
And what I see is that there's NO my message (e.g. "hello") in the msghdr structure that tcp_sendmsg receives,
e.g. in (char*)msg->msg_iov->iov_base, although debugger shows that msg->msg_iov->iov_len = 6, e.g. equals to "hello" message length (+1).
Can anyone explain where I am wrong or what I do not understand?
I am using the UML kernel and standard gdb debugger.
