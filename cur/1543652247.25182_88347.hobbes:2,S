It would take a special hook that ran after the notifiers, and
device_shutdown.  At least in the normal case running what shutdown
code we can is fairly important.  And hooking the notifier lists
would not give a guarantee of going last.
There is a long ways to go in working with device drivers to even get
the easy kexec case working stably, in non-special circumstances.
The kernel gets there great but it does not cope well with the APICs
activated and the legacy pic disabled during bootup.  
The additional device shutdown code is useful even in the normal
reboot path.  Most BIOS's don't care but it should fix a few problems
with BIOS that are not as paranoid about the state of the system as
they should be when reboot is called.  Little things like always
shutting down on the bootstrap cpu are on my todo list.
