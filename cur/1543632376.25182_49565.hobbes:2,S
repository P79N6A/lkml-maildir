kbuild-2.5 - mdbm database files/programs
Here we have the very heart of kbuild-2.5: memory database, as used in
BitKeeper and others.
You will need this patch in generic for kbuild-2.5.
Your kernel will compile with only this patch enabled, but there's
no point in doing so. You should get the other kbuild-2.5 patches, too.
