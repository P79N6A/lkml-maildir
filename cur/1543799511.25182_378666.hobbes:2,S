To be honest, I think this is just adding a third layer of paper over
the crack in the wall.  The original code assumed x86; the ia64 port
added enough emulation to make it look like x86 and now altix fixes a
couple of assumptions.  I say: bleh.
What we actually need is an interface provided by the architecture that
allocates a new irq.  I have a hankering to implement MSI on PA-RISC but
haven't found the time ...
