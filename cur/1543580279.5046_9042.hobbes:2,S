Everyone who says, disk is cheap, ought to donate me one.
Everyone who says, memory is cheap, has to send me some.
I'm still stuck with a P-133, 56 MB RAM (60-70 ns, some EDO,
some FPM) and not only Linux but also W2K on a 2.1 and a 0.8 GB
HDD.
I accept donations in IDE and SCSI, as well as parport devices.
