Other than it's a gross hack rather than a fix.  However, for 2.4, I
think this is probably the best solution without creating a risk of
other init ordering problems.  Ed, any comments?
In 2.5, its easier to solve; we just need to make sure serial is
initialised before parport.  This is easy, since serial now has its
own drivers/serial subdirectory.
