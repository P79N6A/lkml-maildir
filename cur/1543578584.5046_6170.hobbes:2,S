The "fix" was an hdparm command like hdparm -X66 -m16c1d1 /dev/hda.
Which I set for my VIA 686a on a Tyan mobo w a 1G Athlon.
Interestingly, initially feeding that chip 40 wire cables (w/o the
-X66 of course) would result in the crc errors followed by DMA turn off,
about 85% of time... Other 15% was fine and DMA worked great.
I then switched to the 80 wire cable and DMA became rock solid at
which point the -X66 was added.
Just thought I'd add some data points :)
