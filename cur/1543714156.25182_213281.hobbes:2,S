This is true, however, that doesn't mean it will work. There are a lot of 
differences between 2.2 and 2.4.
At very least you must run make oldconfig to bring things forward, and I'm not 
sure you can go backwards, though it might work.
But for all of that, you'll still have to answer lots of questions, and know 
your machine pretty well.
Why do you need the older kernel?
