Hope this hasn't been posted already.
Not sure if I am right or not on this but this seems to be related, at
least on my box, to the APIC IDs of the CPUs.  I am using an Intel
SE7500CW, populated with 2x XEONs.  The APIC ID's of the CPUs are 0 & 1
for the first physical CPU, and 6 & 7 for the second physical CPU (don't
ask me why).  If I don't use NR_CPUs = 8, I don't seem to see the second
physical CPU.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
