I was playing around only with kmemsize. I think the reason for my observation
is this
bash --> (my utility) --> set_bcid()
Since bash spawns my utility in a separate process, it creates and assigns
a bean counter to it and then my utility exits. Unless it spawns/exec()'s a
new shell, the beancounter is freed when the task exits (my utility).
