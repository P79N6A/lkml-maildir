Comments:
* Having a mkinitrd that's not a shell script is a godsend.  I would 
endorse yaird on that fact alone :)
* I've long wanted a "mkinitfoo" that would create .cpio.gz for 
initramfs by default.  So, good job there, too.
* Eventually your script will need pull in, into the initramfs, klibc 
and programs linked against klibc.
