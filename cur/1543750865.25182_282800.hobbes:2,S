Do you want a long list of message-IDs going way, way back?  Ones of Linus'
postings saying that there never had been any promise whatsoever of in-kernel
interfaces staying unchanged...
For fsck sake, people, give it a rest already.  3rd-party kernel modules
are and had always been responsibility of their maintainers, regardless
of licensing, commercial status, etc.  Exported functions and data structures
can and do change; doing out-of-tree development means taking a calculated
risk and being ready to follow these changes.
So yes, it *had* been written.  Many times.  In details.  With feeling.
