I believe eventpoll has a similar problem. Not a big problem, but we can be 
cleaner. Normally, the access_ok() done in sys_epoll_wait() should catch non 
writeable user area, unless another thread play VM game (the thread in 
sys_epoll_wait() can sleep)
[PATCH] eventpoll : In case a fault occurs during copy_to_user(), we should 
report the count of events that were successfully copied into user space, 
instead of EFAULT. That would be consistent with behavior of read/write() 
syscalls for example.
