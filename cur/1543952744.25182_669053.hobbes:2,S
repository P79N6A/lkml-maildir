Subject: [PATCH] sysctl: vm.drop_caches should be writable only
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/19/283

This file's functionality is to tell the system to do a cache reclaiming,
the possible value to write to it is only 1, 2 or 3, reading from it will
get the last value written to it, that's meaingless.
