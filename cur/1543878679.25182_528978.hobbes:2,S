Jan,
	This can be removed if needed; however, I'm just copying what
the other kfree()'s are doing in this function.  Any instance of a
typecast that I introduced in these patches are just following what
others have done in that section of the code.  So the cast is just for
consistency in this particular area.  If you'd like me to remove it, I
can do that.
Thanks,
