Very probably this is due to broken way how X themselves implement 
auto-repeat, instead of using kernel-provided auto-repeat functionality. I 
guess you are not able to reproduce this problem in the console, but only 
X, right?

AFAIK it's a problem with X being confused by scheduler behavior (which is 
not necessarily wrong).
