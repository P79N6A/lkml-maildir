Paul and I talked about this and we guessed it is an intel hack so they
can use the "mask the stack pointer to get to struct thread_info" trick.
On archs where we use a register to point to current I cant see why we
need this thread_info junk. I'd be happy if we could put it all in the
task struct for non intel.
