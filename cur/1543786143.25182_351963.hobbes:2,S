I don't think you will be able to compile 2.4 kernel on to the 2.6
kernel based distro .... as in 2.6 based distro, mod-utils and other
packages are updated and will only support 2.6 based kernel .... So
its better to get 2.4 kernel based distribution .... (and can keep/run
both 2.6 and 2.4 based distributions simultanously on the same system,
so that you can boot in any of them as per your requirement of 2.4 or
2.6 kernel)
