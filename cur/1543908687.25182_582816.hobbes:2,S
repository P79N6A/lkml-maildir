Documentation/00-INDEX line 5:

There was only one instance of it not being the case.  I can use indentation 
level instead (which is what Kconfig uses to identify help text, so I'm not 
leaking pythonisms into the kernel that aren't already there), but the one 
line thing seemed to be an existing standard.
I'm also relying on the first file in the list being documentation for 
00-INDEX itself.  (If it breaks, I'll either try to derive a new heuristic 
and change the script, or submit a patch to change the index.  That one would 
be a more difficult heuristic to replace, though.)

*shrug*  I can go either way on that, but people get all funny about 
whitespace being significant and the one line thing wasn't my idea. :)
