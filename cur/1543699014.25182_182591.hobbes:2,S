Hi.
I have an Supermicro Superserver (wow!) 8040 or 8060 with a two Intel
Xeon (p3-based with 1MB cache) and a Mylex AcceleRAID 352. We recently
upgraded from 2 to 4GB of memory.
There seems to a problem with IO and high memory. Suddenly IO
performance will degrade dramatically (throughput of about 50KB/s).
Booting the machine with "mem=2048" remedies this.
We have tried replacing the memory with another make - no luck.
Any hints?
