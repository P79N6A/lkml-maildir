Hi !
Since I run the 2.3.14/2.3.15-pre3 kernel I get the following
error from fsck every 3. or 4. reboot:
 /dev/hda6: Inode 208981, i_size is 387916 should be 389120   FIXED
The error is automatically fixed by fsck, but after a while 
it appears again, the inode is different, the wrong i_size and
the size it should be are always the same, e.g. 10 or 15
reboots ago, I had
 /dev/hda6: Inode 208983, i_size is 387916 should be 389120   FIXED
It seems that this behaviour is somehow related to the 2.3.14 (and above)
kernels (using the 2.2.xx kernels there is no such error at all),
or will my harddisk soon be dead ??
