Let me note that "usb"/"ac" is just names pda-power driver
gives for these supplies. So, it's not power supply class issue,
but pda-power.
As for pda-power.. Yes, it can name them "supply0" and "supply1"...
Or maybe "pda-supplyX", but I don't see any need to maim name just
because it is very similar to its type. ;-) Anyhow I don't care
much, i.e. if you or anyone else will insist, I'll change
pda-power's supply names with no problems.
Thanks,
