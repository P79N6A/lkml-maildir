I_MUTEX_CHILD is only used in renames. All other childs are left
unannotated, it feels a bit sloppy (and it probably is) but it works
out. Unannotated lock operations are a separate class on their own, as
are I_MUTEX_NORMAL (used when you don't feel like figuring out which
would be the proper level, and there is no further nesting AFAIK).
This way you'll end up with PARENT -> {NORMAL, unannotated} which is as
valid as PARENT -> CHILD.
The only danger would be if you also have a locking sequence like CHILD
-> PARENT, that could go unnoticed, because the other direction is not
from CHILD. This could hide real deadlocks.
/me looks at Arjan, did I get it right?

Ah, right, must've overlooked it.
Thanks
