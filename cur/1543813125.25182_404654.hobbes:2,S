Yes.  The important point for reasoning about it is that we have a fixed
point that we append or prepend to.
I think I have finally figured out the invariants we will need to
send signals using just the rcu_read_lock().  In that case we want to
traverse the list in such a way that we are guaranteed to never see
new entries.  That gives us an atomic snapshot of the tasks to send
signals to, and it gives us a progress guarantee.
Now I need to look and see if any one has documented any rules
regarding atomicity of sending signals to a group of processes.
