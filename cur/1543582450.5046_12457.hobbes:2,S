    Why isn't there a sendfile64?
because nobody has implemented on -- arguably it's not needed; the
different between:
	sendfile64(...)
and
	while(blah){
		sendfile( ... 1G or so ...)
	}
probably won't be detectable anyhow. I see no reason why sendfile64
should be purely user-space (then again, I see no reason why not to
extend the kernel API as is, but last time I tested it is was busted
WRT signals so I would rather that be fixed before further
proliferation there).
