Typical warning that hows on either 32-bit or 64-bit systems but not
both. It's usually easily fixed by replacing %i by %zi.

Said drivers are in the process of being moved to drivers/rtc - which
is why I was asking.

Ah. Very good point. I always considered this
(i2c_smbus_read_i2c_block_data not allowing the caller to specify the
transfer length) a bug. Maybe the time has come to finally fix it, so
that drivers which need that kind of transaction can finally use it.
I'll work on it, patch to follow.

Try a byte read of the last register, followed by a byte read of the
next register (which doesn't exist). Some chips will succeed the first
read and fail the second one, allowing you to test the number of
registers. The pca9539 driver does this if you want an example.
But it is also possible that reading a non-existent register will
return something (not an error), such as the value of the last read
register, or the value of an arbitrary register. You really have to
try. The user-space tool "i2cdump" comes in handy for such tests.
If there really is no way to detect the chip, this is one more reason
to switch to the new i2c model.

Thanks for using Lindent, I can only encourage people to do that
especially for new drivers. As a matter of fact, the rest of your
driver was perfect with regards to indentation :) However, if Lindent
indeed did these two mistakes, it needs to be fixed.
