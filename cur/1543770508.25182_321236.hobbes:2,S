Yes, I'll occasionally do patches which were written by "A" as:
From: A
...
Signed-off-by: B
And that comes through email as:
...
From: <akpm@osdl.org>
...
From: A
...
Signed-off-by: B
which means that the algorithm for identifying the author is "the final
From:".
I guess the bug here is the use of From: to identify the primary author,
because transporting the patch via email adds ambiguity.
Maybe we should introduce "^Author:"?
