This requires either mind-reading machine, or some feedback from Ulrich.
Last main from him about kevent was related to 25 release.
As far as I can see, only questionable parts are signal mask in
syscalls, but nature of kevent signal delivering does not require it,
since mask of pending signals is not updated if special flag is set,
and exceeded functionality (like hrtimers accessible through kevent
interface and as POSIX addon).
