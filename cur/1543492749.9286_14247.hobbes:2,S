`softupdates' is somewhere in-between. 
The normal mode of ext2fs is similar to the async mode of Berkeley FFS,
performance and security-wise, whereas the sync-mode of ext2fs would be
on a par with the older strategy of Berkeley FFS, and soft-updates is
almost on a par with ext2fs' normal mode for speed, and sync-mode for
robustness.
(not taking into account other factors, such as dentries, or the buffer-cache,
or uvm, which are all important things for a file-system perfs otherwise.
Heck, my BSD background shows :) )
