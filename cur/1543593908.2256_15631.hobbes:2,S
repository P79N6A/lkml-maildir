Hi,
Sorry to disturb you.
I have written a file system in 2.2.14 kernel similar to ramfs on 2.5
kernel. I am able to register,mount and do file and directory operations.
I tried to write a C program and compile it. The compilation gave me the
object file. When i tried to run the object file it gave me an error 
" cannot execute binary file". I entered gdb and  I could get the error
"exec format error". What is exec format error and what is it because of?
Please help me out with this info.
Thanks in advance,
Regards,
sathish
