I think the problem it's that designated initializers are not implemented in 
the GNU c++ compiler, so you have to initialize all the field in the structure.

By the way, C99 syntax is better, most of the kernel has been changed to the
new syntax:
struct file_operations totcl_fops=
{
    .read=totcl_read,
    .open=totcl_open,
    .release=toctl_release,
};
