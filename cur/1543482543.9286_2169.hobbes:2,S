Do I need to create a filesystem under /dev/hda1 (first partition,
521 MB) and move everything under /boot to /dev/hda1 and mount it on
/boot?
Is my following lilo setting is correct?
boot=/dev/hda1
root=/dev/hda3
Image=vmlinuz-2.2.0-final
label=linux
I can't move my root from /dev/hda3 -> /dev/hda1
because  /opt is in /dev/hda2 and I have only one hard disk.
Actually I tried this before and LILO does't understand the
keys at all (if I press ENTER it says **interrupt**) and still
it complained the device 0303 has cyls>1024.
When I run lilo, is it mandatory that /boot must be in /dev/hda1?
Is there a simple way to redefine my root partition?
Is it possible to boot from a logical partition, I prefer to
repartition /dev/hda1 into two: one for boot and one for win98.
Thanks & Brdgs
