I don't know much about existing drivers.  I know for embedded systems,
processes reading files and getting blocked, interrupt handlers (or its
bottom-half handler) waking them up is *VERY COMMON*.
I do agree that the window is small.   (That is the reason I have to
patch kernel in order to deterministically create the scenario in my
test)
Unfortunately, for most embedded systems, 99.99% of times being correct 
is not good enough.
