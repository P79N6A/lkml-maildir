Yes and that's because ACPI regards hibernation as a _sleep_ state, something
more like S3 (suspend to RAM) than S5 (power off).
In fact even now we're doing things that are strange from the ACPI standpoint.
For example, we should really execute _PTS once during the entire transition
and we shouldn't call _WAK after we've created the image.  We're doing that
now due to some design limitations, but in fact we shouldn't.

I'm not sure about the "easier" part, quite frankly.  Also, with our current
ordering of code the in-kernel hibernation will need the same callbacks
as the kexec-based thing.  However, with the in-kernel approach we can
attempt (in the future) to be more ACPI compliant, so to speak, but with the
kexec-based approach that won't be possible.
Whether it's a good idea to follow ACPI, as far as hibernation is concerned, is
a separate question, but IMO we won't be able to answer it without _lots_ of
testing on vaious BIOS/firmware configurations.  Our experience so far
indicates that at least some BIOSes expect us to follow ACPI and misbehave
otherwise, so for those systems there should be an "ACPI way" available.
[Others just don't work well if we try to follow ACPI and those may be handled
using the kexec-based approach, but that doesn't mean that we can just ignore
the ACPI compliance issue, at least for now.]
Thanks,
