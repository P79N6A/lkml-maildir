(test programs are attached at the end)
We are experiencing strange data corruption problems using RH6.1 nfs client and
Solaris nfs server (SunOS 5.6). Later it is also found that same problem happened
on RH6.1 nfs server too, with much less frequency. This is likely to be a nfs
problem (not clear client or server) because it won't happen if running on
local disks. We hope we can get help by distributing the problem.
The symptom is as this:
If do the following procedure:
1. A data block is first written to file
2. Then write a large amount of data following the block
3. Use fseek to seek back to the data block and update with new values,
at the 3rd step, sometimes the data block is failed to be updated.
The interesting thing is that if we use fopen(<name>,"w+") instead of
using "w", there are much less failures (almost none on Soloaris, but
some on RH6.1 nfs server). We don't know why.
Things to note:
. all file handling is using fstream with fopen, fseek, ftell, fwrite. No
  error messages are reported when data corrupted
. fflush() doesn't help at all.
. the problem seems to be non-deterministic, meaning it doesn't happen
  all the time and it doesn't necessarily happen at the same place. This
  also makes debugging difficult.
. the problem won't happen when writing to local disk
Any response for solutions or same experiences would be appreciated. Please
make sure you also send your answer to my email address. Thanks in advance.

PS
The following are two programs that demonstrate the problem. testw.c
will do the above procedure 100 times. The data block is a integer initialized
to zero and updated to non-zero. testr.c will check the output file
and exit if it finds that the data block remains zero. An example output of
running testr program:
*** READ TOC hoff = 16808
*** READ TOC hoff = 24700
*** READ TOC hoff = 40366
*** READ TOC hoff = 56339
*** READ TOC hoff = 74576
*** READ TOC hoff = 0
wrong = 1
which says the testw.c program fails at the 6th iteration.
--- test programs ------

    if(fseek(fp,start,0) == -1)
      fprintf(stderr, "fseek back to the beginning failed\n");
    if((fwrite(&hoff, sizeof(int), 1, fp)) != 1)
      fprintf(stderr, "fwrite rewriting failed\n");;
  }
  fclose(fp);
  free(data);
  return 0;
}
------- the following is the read program to validate the output file ------
/*************************************************************/

/*************************************************************/

  for (i=0;i<100;i++) {
    fread(&hoff, sizeof(char), sizeof(int), fp);
    printf("*** READ TOC hoff = %ld \n",hoff);
    if (hoff == 0) {
      wrong ++;
      break;
    }
    fseek(fp,hoff,0);
  }
