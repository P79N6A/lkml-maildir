If your data is dynamic in size, then less than you get with a custom
implemented method, see 
http://www.devlinux.org/namesys,
 we pack small
files into a single block efficiently.

If /etc/passwd is a directory of one line files, it could be useful to
edit the /etc/passwd directory in one emacs buffer.

This belongs in the namespace not the gui.  It should not be dependent
on the existence of xwindows.

I think it needs to be the reverse, it is a file/dir in my filesystem,
and a tarballish thing elsewhere.

Not my area, but I am sure you can make it work.  Worry about caching on
the controllers.  I think there are some controllers with protocols for
sharing disk drives, I really don't know much about it.
