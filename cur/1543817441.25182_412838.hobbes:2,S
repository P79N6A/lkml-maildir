AFAIK The goal of a bitmap operations API (we are not talking about atomic 
operations here) is to make bitmap operations as efficient as possible and 
as simple as possible. We already have multiple special cases for each 
bitmap operation
I.e.
clear_bit()
__clear_bit()
and some people talk abouit
clear_bit_lock()
clear_bit_unlock()
What I am prosing is to do one clear_bit_mode function that can take a 
parameter customizing its synchronization behavior.
clear_bit_mode(bit,addr,mode)
