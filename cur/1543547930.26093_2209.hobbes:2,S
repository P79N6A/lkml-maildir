I can't recall a time where that cosmetic error didn't exist. Something
to do with probing for a second drive, IIRC, which never exists on the
Integrated ESDI controller of the TP.

The last "maintainer" that I know of was myself, but all I was ever able
to do was ensure that it didn't crash and burn on the TP and model
55SX. I only have the TP now, so I don't intend to go messing with it
(last time I did that, we lost support for multiple ESDI drives). It's a
little difficult to maintain drivers with no documentation and
insufficient test hardware... Unforunately, the original author
disappeared years ago.
