Yes.
Sometime back (a few weeks?) Stefan Dosinger mailed (on acpi4linux
list?) about his PCI devices all giving oops on resume and to avoid,
he was using setpci to write back the config space the way it was
before suspend. If the drivers for those devices save/restored, then
they will probably work.
