Yes, you are partially right. The GCC project had already the problem
that they startet too simple with their pipeline management and had to
redesign it. 
If the kernel framework will not suffice the vendor needs (e.g. they
don't win in the benchmark, just because we cannot model their
hardware), it will be simply not used and we'll get just another nvidia
like driver.
But maybe I've read to much GCC internals recently, so I favor machine
descriptions and stateful pipeline descriptions for this ;-)
Your key argument still holds: This is just taking a instruction/data stream
from multiple sources and mapping it to another one with multiple
data/instruction sinks -> JIT.

I noticed that it's ok to keep the design in mind, even in the comments,
but it never proved good to me to keep the design in dead code and
useless layers.
So I guess, we agree here ;-)
