I'm hitting this problem too, and as it's still present in the 2.6.19 final, I'm
assuming you never got enough information to chase it. I found the following
note in the debian BTS that seems relevant:
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=363682
I can confirm that if I remove the amd76x_edac module and reload amd_k7_agp, it
detects the aperture. If I then reload radeon.ko and X, I get DRI (and AIGLX).
So hopefully that's a lead to what might have changed...
