Subject: [PATCH 0/7] Battery class, external power framework, ds2760 battery
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi all,
I believe most battery issues elaborated and settled, and battery
class has grown up for the -mm merge. Also, I hope that current
battery stuff will make everyone happy at some grade.
This patchset accumulated ideas and suggestions from reviews by
David Brownell, Evgeniy Polyakov, Greg KH, Henrique de Moraes Holschuh,
Ian Molton, Matt Reimer, Matthew Garrett, Ondrej Zajicek,
Paul Sokolovsky, Pavel Machek, Randy Dunlap, Russell King and
Shem Multinymous.
Thanks for the time you spent reviewing these patches!

Andrew, would you please merge these patches into -mm? They're against
today's Linus git tree.
I hope it isn't too late for the merge. If it is, please tell me when I
should come back.
