Yes.  I'm pretty sure I sent Sam a patch for that at one point ages ago,
but I've been distracted and haven't updated it recently.
I think using git-name-rev --tags as this change does is a lot simpler
than what I was trying to do.
So, Sam, if you'd prefer this version, feel free, or let me know and
I'll resend the one or two patches I have hanging around to you.

And this is a decent feature, too. I like it.
The only reservation I have about converting from Perl to Bourne shell
is that if adding support for, say, Mercurial (or maybe CVS, etc) wants
to mangle it somehow, via say MD5, that becomes a little bit more
difficult to do, or at worst, introduces an additional dependency on
something like md5sum.
So, I like it:
