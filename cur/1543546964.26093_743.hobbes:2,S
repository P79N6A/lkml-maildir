readdir() holds ->both i_sem and ->i_zombie, so I'm not sure what other
exclusion do you need.
Darnit, documentation on filesystem locking is there for purpose. First
folks complain about its absence, then they don't bother to read the
bloody thing once it is there. Furrfu...
Said that, handling of indirect blocks used to be badly b0rken on all
normal filesystems and it had been fixed only on ext2, so I wouldn't be
amazed if regular files were bad on B-tree style filesystems. Directories
are easy - all requests are process-synchronous (no pageout), no
truncate() in sight, so the life is better.
