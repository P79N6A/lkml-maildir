Apologies, I overlooked your patch.

I suggest also to search on the list a patch that avoids recalculating
counters on all tasks. It allows you to recalculate the counters only on
the runqueue. So you could run gds_remove_task();gds_add_task()
unconditionally in gds_switch(). I suggest you also to move the
slot-fields near the runqueue fields, so you may get them on the same
cacheline while inserting/removing the task from the runqueue.

It's not in the web case but it is the case when you have to do some real
calculation (povray just for example).
