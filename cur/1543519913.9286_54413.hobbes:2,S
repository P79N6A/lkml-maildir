Subject: 2.3.34-pre2 bug: kernel panic if no disk in SCSI ZIP drive.

Hi,
I just switched on my machine and forgot to leave the disk in the ZIP 
drive and got a panic on partition check. That's not right - it should 
not attempt to read partitions if the disk is removable and is not there.
Regards,
Tigran.
