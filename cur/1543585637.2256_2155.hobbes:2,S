Thanks for cutting out relevant parts that said how to increase user
base and satisfaction keeping and using the existent possibility as
well.

Nonsense hodgepodge. See and/or mesaure the impact. I sent numbers in my
former email. You also missed non-overcommit must be _optional_ [i.e.
you wouldn't be forced to use it ;)]. Yes, there are users and
enterprises who require it and would happily pay the 50-100% extra swap
space for the same workload and extra reliability.

At every time you add/delete users, add/delete special apps, etc.
Please note again, some people wants this way, some only for sometimes,
and others really don't care because system guarantees for the admins
they will always have the resources to take action [unfortunately this
is not Linux].

Rik's killer is quite fine at _default_. But there will be always people
who won't like it [the bastards think humans can still make better
decisions than machines]. Wouldn't it be win for both sides if you could
point out, "Hey, if you don't like the default, use the
/proc/sys/vm/oom_killer interface"? As I said before there are also
such patch by Chris Swiedler and definitely not a huge, complex one.
And these stupid threads could be forgotten for good and all.

Depends, guaranteed underutilisation or guaranteed extra unreliability
fit the picture many times as well.

Thanks for expressing your opinion but others [not necessarily me] have
"occasionally" other one depending on the job what the box must do.
