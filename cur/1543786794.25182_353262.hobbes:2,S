Well local_bh_disable touches the preempt count too, although we
can probably assume that's hot in cache.
You might also find yours has a bigger icache footprint as well.

To be honest I'd say that you wouldn't be able to measure it if
you're going through a regular system call path, although such
a measurement certainly won't hurt.
I don't have a better idea though. I don't think a busy loop
microbenchmark is going to be very informative either, it might
actually give a measurable difference but that difference
probably won't be too representitive of real use :\
