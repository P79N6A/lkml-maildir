Iesterday I compiled 2.2.11, after removing hfmodem it compiled fine.
But this morning I found a lot of segfault messages from init (at
least, I think... there's no trace of them in the log) and also these
errors:
Aug 22 01:17:48 penny kernel: sl0: transmit timed out, driver error? 
Aug 22 01:19:43 penny kernel: sl0: transmit timed out, driver error? 
Aug 22 01:20:01 penny kernel:  
Aug 22 01:20:09 penny kernel: Out of memory for sh. 
Aug 22 01:21:24 penny kernel:  
Aug 22 01:21:25 penny kernel: Out of memory for jnos. 
Aug 22 01:21:27 penny kernel:  
there are errors like this for each job that tried to run tonight.
Is this a known problem with 2.2.11 ?
