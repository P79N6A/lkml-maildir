I actually had a patch almost ready to send out the nuked memcg->obsolete.
A difference in mine is that I did
#define css_is_removed(__css) test_bit(CSS_REMOVED, &(__css)->css.flags)
so that you can use it on any subsystem state object that contains a
"struct cgroup_subsys_state css;" field, which is currently all of
them I think, without having to add the "->css" every time.
