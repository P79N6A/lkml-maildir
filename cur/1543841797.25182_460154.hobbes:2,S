Sure!
With static modules options, splash support, disk encryption, suspend,
local initrd settings we need much more than 256 bytes...

But the command line is a wonderful tool... It allows you to compile
the same kernel/initramfs and install it on different machines,
modifying only the boot loader configuration file. It also allows
several boot profiles at boot loader level, without the need to
replaces files or have complex initrd...
 So it worth modifying current implementation.
