Another very cryptic directory whose contents say nothing to me.
Configuration files should be self-documenting and editable,
instead having to be created based on long documentation.
The simple /etc/modules -- which at least Debian's stock kernels
do not use -- qualifies, but few other files these days do.

And break everything else, such as my symlinks, permissions, etc. 
I'm not going to learn its cryptic special-case config files for 
such trivial tasks as creating a fucking symlink or change the 
permissions of a file, for which exist general purpose methods:
chmod, chown, ln -s.

Mapping everything to scsi nodes is brain damaged. The old hda, hdb,
etc. mappings had somewhat clear correspondence between to physical
evice addresses, and were easy to use without such complicated crap
as udev. Of course, I'd prefer just device unique IDs being used,
where possible... but I'm not going to suffer udev for that.

I was not talking of encrypted disks but cryptic udev config files,
that the distros are going to break on every upgrade.

But traditional /dev does not lose permissions and symlinks. udev 
tmpfs shadow brain damage does. You have to illogically and
inconveniently edit udev's cryptic config files instead, and yet
it in no way stops /dev from being modified.

And they most of them cater for idiot users, and the rest for
develors what want to do it all from scratch. Mere power users
who want to tune the system to their needs, but easily and without
WIMPshit (through _simple_ self-documenting configuration files),
are forgotten these days.

I've never seen a system that would do so. And I won't use udev.
