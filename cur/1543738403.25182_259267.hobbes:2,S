Good point.  I was painting with too wide a brush (hmmm ... someday I
should see if I can get through an entire post without an analogy ...)
When people show a good ability to work with others on lkml who have a
shared interest and sufficient competence in an area, then it doesn't
much matter what company they work for.  I see such a discussion
happening on another portion of this thread, with yourself, Nick, Peter
and Erich, involving the domain scheduler.  That works well.
So far I have been unable to achieve confidence in my ability to
interact well with the key CKRM folks.  In various ways, I have found
their project, and their demeanor on this list, to be difficult for me
to approach.
Normally this wouldn't matter.  However Andrew and others have proposed
that cpusets have a critical dependency on CKRM.  Now it matters.
If I am to have a critical project dependency on an external group with
whom I lack confidence that we share sufficient common interest and a
healthy ability to communicate, then I prefer a more adversarial style
of relations, with explicit contracts, minimum clearly defined and
verifiable deliverables, and suitable fallback contingencies in place.
I keep a sharp eye out for potential conflicts of interest.
My suggestion to separate the virtual resource management framework
(which I named 'vrm') from CKRM's other elements, such as fair share
scheduling, was an attempt to establish such a minimum verifiable
deliverable.  That suggestion was clearly dead on arrival.
My apologies for implicating everyone whose email ends in "ibm.com" in
my earlier comment.  IBM is a big place, and all manner and variety
of people work there.  It's a pleasure working with yourself, Matthew,
and many others from IBM.
