I haven't read the GPLv3 draft myself, but I would guess that private
signing key language is aimed squarely at TiVo.  They use a Linux
kernel, but only kernel binaries signed by them will load (so you can't
modify the kernel without jumping through hoops).  Is that
"user-unfriendly"?  Probably so, but only to a small percentage of the
users.
