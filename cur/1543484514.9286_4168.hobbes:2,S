Have you tried enabling mtrr?
In kernel config:
1: code maturity options - prompt for development and/or incomplete
code/drivers
2. processur type and features - MTRR support 
I have done these things with kernel 2.1.130 and with motherboards 
like QDI, Intel and Compaq and in every board mtrr says it has
something to fix.
