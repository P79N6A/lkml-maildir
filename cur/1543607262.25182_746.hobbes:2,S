I have 2 observations -
If you don't enable highmem support, you'll
be able to use about 960 MB of your 1 GB -
no big loss, right?
I've been running on a couple machines
with SMP and the 4 GB option, and they
seem quite stable (there was a highmem
bug in the preempt patch, but that is fixed
in the most recent release)
All things considered, it works quite well.
