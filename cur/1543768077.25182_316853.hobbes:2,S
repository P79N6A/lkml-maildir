i've uploaded my latest tree to:
    
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
it's easy to give it a go, it's pretty much plug & play, just apply 
these patches ontop of a vanilla 2.6.11 kernel tree:
   
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/patch-2.6.12-rc4.bz2
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/realtime-preempt-2.6.12-rc4-V0.7.47-00
take your usual .config, do a 'make oldconfig', make sure you pick up 
PREEMPT_RT (you can leave all the other .config options at their default 
values), recompile and you should be set. All RT tasks (SCHED_FIFO, 
SCHED_RR) will get PI handling and will use the plist.h code.
