as of kernel version 2.3.13 (this was not happening in 2.3.12), I
encountered the following build problem:
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/blk.h:378: warning: `do_sd' defined but not used
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/blk.h:402: warning: `do_sd_request' declared `static' but never defined

Was this caused by this change in pci.h?
-       unsigned long   base_address[6];
+       struct resource resource[6];
I do not follow the list, so if anyone responds to this (don't bother if I'm
being dumb), I'd appreciate if you CC me.
Thanks,
Wesley
