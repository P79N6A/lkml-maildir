I totally disagree here, bugzilla is a very good tool. If someone is
too lazy to look at it it's his problem.
Kernel Janitors can pick out some bugs which aren't addressed by
anyone or got left behind. I also found some bugs there which could
have been solved by anyone here, the matter is just that many people
aren't interested in mainly bug fixing and many also work on different
other topics here.
How else should bugs get handled, sending them to the lkml?
I'm 100% sure some bugreports will also get lost then, but on the lkml
they'll very likely remain lost whereas in the bugzilla they'll remain
as open.

as for the em28xx I actively use it, but I also set up a mailinglist
etc. and there are many supporters already...

what are your suggestions to improve a bugreporting tool, I'm very
sure that many people, especially people who want to get into existing
projects here, would love to contribute.

I'd say this is a personal opinion, some people will get along with it
and some of them will not...
