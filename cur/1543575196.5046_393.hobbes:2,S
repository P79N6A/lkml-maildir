FWIW, Mandrake Linux includes a tool MandrakeUpdate which allows 
downloading of "Normal Updates" or "Development Updates".  If you chose 
Devel Upd, you get the following warning:
         Caution !  These packages are NOT well tested.
         You really can screw up your system
         by installing them.
Perhaps the configure tools could recognize a DANGEROUS status (or keyword 
or ???) and would display such a message ...
