That sounds like asking for trouble, if you ask me (well you did :-)
And being a very rarely exercised path (if at all, you should be very
unlucky to NOT get a request even with GFP_ATOMIC), then it wont even
get tested properly. So I'd say stick to GFP_ATOMIC, and just plug the
device and retry if you get into allocation errors.
