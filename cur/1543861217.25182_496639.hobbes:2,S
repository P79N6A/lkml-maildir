 Hi David,
  good code and well commented, thank you.
 I only have some comments:
 - I would put anything that is x86 related (pnp,acpi)
 in a separate file so that people working on
 non x86 systems can have a better grasp of the driver.
 - the name should be rtc-mc146818 to be coherent with
 the other drivers, but this can cause confusion.
 - please put yourself in MODULE_AUTHOR
 other than that, I'm fine with the code.
 I'd appreciate if someone (Woody?) can test
 this code on ARM.
