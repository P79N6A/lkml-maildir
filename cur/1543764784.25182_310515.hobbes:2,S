Yes, I am puzzled for a while how to use git until I realize that it is
a version file system.
BTW, one thing I learn from ext3 is that it is very useful to have some
compatible flag for future development. I think if we want to reserve some
room in the file format for further development of git, it is the right time
to do it before it get bigs. e.g. an optional variable size header in "tree"
including format version and capability etc. I can see the counter argument
that it is not as important as a real file system because it is a lot easier
bring it off line to upgrade the whole tree.
One the other hand, it is almost did not cost any thing in terms of space and
CPU time, most directory did not get to file system block boundary so extra few bytes
is almost free. If carefully planed, it will make the future up grade of git
a lot smoother.
What do you think?
