One could continue this thinking (more load_balance corrections than 
timeslice, IMO) on to SMT processors, where the throughput of a sibling is 
highly dependent on what the other siblings are doing in the same core.  For 
example, in a dual proc system, the first physical cpu with one task will run 
much faster than the second cpu with 2 tasks.  Actually, using a shared 
runqueue would probably fix this (something we still don't have in 2.6-test).
But one other thing, and maybe this has been brought up before (sorry, I have 
not been following all the discussions), but why are we not altering 
timeslice based on the runqueue length for that processor?  Would it not make 
sense, for the sake of good interactivity, to lower all the timeslices when 
we have a longer runqueue?
