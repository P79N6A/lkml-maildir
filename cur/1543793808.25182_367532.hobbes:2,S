Hello Pekka, 
I was too quick to announce success :( ... 20min. later laptop froze
again. I forgot to do sysrq-T :( and there was no oops or any slab
corruption messages in /var/log/kernel ... :|
Back to the problem ... It might not be a full fix for a problem, it
takes much longer to reproduce ... :\
