If the external module uses a Kbuild file as explained in
Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.txt and then uses both O= and M=
when compiling the module there is no issue.
With respect to moving the .h files - please do so.
drivers/infiniband should only include header used in that same
directory. Not header files potentially uased by fs/.
