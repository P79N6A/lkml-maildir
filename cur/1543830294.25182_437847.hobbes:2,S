There is a third possibility, that falls in between these two if local
communication is really the bottle neck.
We have the dst cache for caching routes and cache multiple transformations
that happen on a packet.
With a little extra knowledge it is possible to have the separate
routing tables but have special logic that recognizes the local tunnel
device that connects namespaces and have it look into the next
namespaces routes, and build up a complete stack of dst entries of
where the packet needs to go.
I keep forgetting about that possibility.  But as long as everything
is done at the routing layer that should work.

Inside the containers I want all network devices named eth0!

The overhead went down?

Yes.

We need a clean abstraction that optimizes well.
However local communication between containers is not what we should
benchmark.  That can always be improved later.  So long as the
performance is reasonable.  What needs to be benchmarked is the
overhead of namespaces when connected to physical networking devices
and on their own local loopback, and comparing that to a kernel
without namespace support.
If we don't hurt that core case we have an implementation we can
merge.  There are a lot of optimization opportunities for local
communications and we can do that after we have a correct and accepted
implementation.  Anything else is optimizing too soon, and will
just be muddying the waters.
