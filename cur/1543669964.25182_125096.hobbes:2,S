Subject: [RFC] 2.5 TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE preemption race

Hi Andrew, Robert, Alan, Everyone,
 The following 2.5 code fragment seems unsafe in a preempt
environment.  A preemption could occur between the time when
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE is set and the `spin_lock_irqsave'.  This would
cause the task to switch out and never come back, as it would have
been switched away while in TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE without yet having
put itself onto the semaphore wait queue, where it could be found
later by a wakeup service.
    void __down(struct semaphore * sem)
    {
	struct task_struct *tsk = current;
	DECLARE_WAITQUEUE(wait, tsk);
	unsigned long flags;
	tsk->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE;
	spin_lock_irqsave(&sem->wait.lock, flags);
	add_wait_queue_exclusive_locked(&sem->wait, &wait);
	....
    }
Is this analysis correct?  If it is, perhaps there is an alternative
to fixing these cases individually: make the TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE/
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE states block preemption.  In which case the
'set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING)' macro would need to include the
same preemption check as 'preemption_enable'.
I suspect there is already some mechanism in place to prevent this
problem, as I have never seen this lockup happen on any of my
2.4-preempt systems.
Joe
PS: here is an example where the preemption race appears harmless.
If a preemption happens between the 'set_current_state' and
'schedule', it only causes the 'schedule' to NOP: the preemption, on
return, would have changed the state from TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE back
to TASK_RUNNING.
void __wait_on_inode(struct inode *inode)
{
	DECLARE_WAITQUEUE(wait, current);
	wait_queue_head_t *wq = i_waitq_head(inode);
	add_wait_queue(wq, &wait);
repeat:
	set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
	if (inode->i_state & I_LOCK) {
		schedule();
		goto repeat;
	}
	remove_wait_queue(wq, &wait);
	__set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING);
}
PPS: the above may need a 'mb()' between the 'add_wait_queue' and
'set_current_state' regardless.
