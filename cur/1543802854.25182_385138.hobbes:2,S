What problem is that patch supposed to fix ?
The Lite5200 has a single PCI port, assigned to idsel 24 (afair) and its
INTA is connected to the IRQ0 pin of the 5200 so that looks correct to me.

I'm not sure I get this either.
Do you mean that change provoked the bug you're talking about or that
before that change the bug was there but just not visible because masked
by the interrupt number being 0 problem ?
