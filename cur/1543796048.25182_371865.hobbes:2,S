If I recall correctly, this whole naming mess has been discussed to  
death before, with the result that almost everybody but Roman thought  
the names were perfectly clear such that a timer is _expected_ to  
expire and a timeout is not, therefore timers should be optimized for  
add=>run=>expire and timeouts optimized for add=>run=>remove.
