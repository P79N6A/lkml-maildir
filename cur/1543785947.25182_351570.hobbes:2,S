Hi folks
I don't know whether this is linuxes cdrecord issue, or kernel issue.
I have dell latitude c640 laptop with their's dvd/cd-rw combo drive that 
appears as:
hdc: ATAPI 24X DVD-ROM CD-R/RW drive, 2048kB Cache
Trouble is, that this drive suppose to write CDs at 24x, and does so under 
windows. But under Linux it works only 8x. Anyone with the same problem 
please?
