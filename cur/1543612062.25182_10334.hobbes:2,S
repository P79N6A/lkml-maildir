Unfortuantely there are still a few special cases where spin_lock_irq()
with already disabled interrupts is both intentional and correct^wnot
buggy (search for sleep_on and cli() through the lkml archives).
And there are optimizations such as
	spin_lock_bh(a);
	spin_unlock(b);
	spin_lock(b);
	spin_unlock_bh(b);
