i think, that if no driver exists, there would be further incentive for
people to reverse engineer, as i also believe that if nvidia didnt
release their closed driver, there would be a project that would have
created a working driver for it(also supporting 3d)

thats entirely different, if some firmware image is loaded into a card,
thats that, but running a userspace daemon is just entirely different,
what would happen if intel for some reason stopped supporting earlier
cards(as hardware manufactureres do after some time), and linux
kernel/userspace gets some change, preventing the binary daemon from
running? then what? we have lost. but i do not believe any change can
really be made, that would mean the existing binary firmware images
could not be loaded into the hardware.
