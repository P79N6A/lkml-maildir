My head hurts.  I tried the latest aic patch.  Tried it on another machine,
same version of compiler though.  (Redhat gcc 2.96 20000731) - I then
tried one of the gcc snapshots, but that won't compile _at all_.
Oddly enough, the problem also occurs in reiserfs.
I've attached a copy of my .config if anyone wants to try it for
themselves...

It's even more strange because memcpy is not called at all from that
routine.  <insert Twilight Zone music>
Generally when this occurs, someone is using a gcc feature to copy a
structure, instead of calling memcpy directly.  Since the kernel is
sometimes compiled with -fno-builtins, and since we also have our own
kernel memcpy, using this particular gcc feature often runs into
problems.
It's not obvious from the code that this is going on, but it's one
possible cause.
Can you try the new aic7xxx driver?  Just search any linux-kernel mail
archive for Justin Gibbs, he is always [re-]posting the link to the
latest aic7xxx driver.  AFAIK it has kernel compatibility and thus
supports 2.2.x...
