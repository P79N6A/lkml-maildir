Thats hot swapping an IDE controller (built into the CF and
PCMCIA stuff)
Drive level hotswap is supported only in the "I unmounted it all
properly first" case and providing your system has the required bus
isolation. Typically its also only allowed in IDE if you have a
single disk on the channel. With dual device you tend to have nasty
accidents pulling something out while the other device is "live"
