This could have been a good idea if Linux was to stay with 15-bit pids
forever. The code you are suggesting will have to be rewritten sometime
to support 32 bit pids. 
The last time I checked, the only thing that stops the move back to
32-bit pids is a bug in the bash shell, and just a few workable IPC
interfaces and libc breakages.
Are 32 bit pids planned for 2.5?
