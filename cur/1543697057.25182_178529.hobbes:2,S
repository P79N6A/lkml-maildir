That seems strange.  If you don't worry about backwards compatibility,
then the new scripts/file2alias.c approach is better, which generates
aliases for each module (depmod then collects these into
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/modules.alias for speed).
The tables generated by depmod are purely for backwards compatibility,
although it does look like they will be required throughout 2.6 at
this stage.
Does that clarify?
Rusty.
