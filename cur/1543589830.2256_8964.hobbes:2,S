    Having thought over the issues I plan to maintain a 32bit dev_t kernel with

    	mknod /dev/ttyF00 c 100 100
    	open("/dev/ttyF00/speed=9600,clocal");
    is illegal. That may be a nice way to get much of the desired behaviour without
    totally breaking compatibility
Linus has suggested we do something similar in 2.5.x for multiple
data streams (or forks) in certain filesystems sugh as HFS and
NTFS... you might want to check the two very similar ideas don't
collide.
