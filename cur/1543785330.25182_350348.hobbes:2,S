Was there some problems with the current version of the ipw2200 driver 
(1.0.6) which required using the 1.0.0 version from several years ago?
And is the Centrino "modem" now working? Or just the wireless?
Good to see all this work, but I suspect it will be a long debug cycle 
as people shake it out. I will probably build it tonight, try it tomorrow.
