Ok I'm hoping maybe someone here can help me. I recently installed Debian 
2.1. It comes with 2.0.36 which worked fine. I however always try to 
recompile the newest for fastest performance and customized hardware. Well, 
I compiled in 2.2.1. After it was done compiling, I did make zlilo and also 
typed lilo, it said "Added Linux" and done. I rebooted and the computer 
locks up at "Ok... booting kernel" The hard drive sounds like it's loading 
something but nothing shows up. Now, interesting enough I decided to try a 
make zImage and dd'ed the image to a floppy then did a rdev from fd0 to 
hda1. Oddly enough when I used the disk, the new compiled kernel worked 
fine and booted up my hard drive. This however in the end is not going to 
be adequete, it's a laptop so I need it to be booting off my hard drive. I 
don't always have the floppy available. Can someone give me an idea of what 
I should do? Can I take the image off the floppy and somehow restore that 
to the hard drive? I've tried recompiling since I was able to boot of the 
disk but that didn't do anything. Thanks in advance.
Jimmy
