Yes, I thought the same thing, and I did just that, but no, it doesn't
fix the latency issue.  This system has very little running, I made sure
that there were no sound servers such as esd or arts running, nothing. 
Basically, a plain KDE (with artsd disabled), mozilla, and Crossover
wine plugin.  Even though I couldn't see how it would affect anything I
tried bumping up the priorities of other processes such as mozilla
itself, X, etc.  Nothing fixed the problem except for lowering the
priority of the wine process.
Could this process be starving the kernel itself so that it simply
doesn't have time to service the sound correctly?
Later,
Tom
