Hi All,
I wondering if there is any support for AGP specific functions in any of the
x86 motherboard chipsets. I'm thinking about any configuration that might be
needed to enable AGP Sideband, 1x, 2x and possibly 4x transfers.
I've done a grep on the 2.2.x source code and nothing relevent seems to come
up. Does anybody have any knowledge on this sort of thing?
Paul
