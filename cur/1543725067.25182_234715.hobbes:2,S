I meant as a general side effect of using SYSRET and not always IRET.
In the later case it would be consistently like i386.
Anyways, even if I applied your patch there would be still inconsistency
because there are several other system calls that use IRET. So I don't
see much advantage in adding a special case just for sigreturn.
