  I've found the ac kernel to be fairly stable.  Provided you don't 
start selecting some of the new bleedin edge features.  The only issues 
I know with 2.4.20-ac1 were some DRI/AGP issues.  I've got a new of 
systems that are only stable with the ac series.

the 2.4 maintainer, and Alan.  Currently the ac ide code works better
