Hi all, and first of all thanks for all the feedback!
Currently i'm on vacation (reading this through webmail, if you notice
anything strange please tell me) and I won't be able to test anything, but
Monday I'm back.
As I mentioned in the first e-mail, I can reproduce this under heavy
_packet_ load, UDP load actually, with 5-20 byte packets at a moderate
rate. No other CPU usage is needed to reproduce it, so it seems to be more
related to the number of packets than to the bytes/sec. Presumably more
packets means more interrupts, hence this behaviour. Also, the fact that
this packet stream is actually a debug-mesage protocol stream which
basically gets dumped to the screen (each UDP packet is one line) might
account for a slightly increased CPU load.
I'm willing to test any patches and other stuff that may be needed, I have
free time currently.
BTW this actually is a pretty big pain in the ass for me, since I need
those messages to get feedback from an application I'm developing. I can
reduce them, but then I get less feedback.
This seems to be something resource-related since the first 15-30 minutes
all goes well, but it just starts (not having touched the computer) and
then there's no going back. I can (with some effort) close down X and
telnet in, but performance is very bad (even the framebuffer screen takes
some time to refresh after a line scroll--and that's a kernel job AFAIK)
BTW when I get back I'll test it with the old 10mbps card that I use for
the external connection (internet) to see if it still happens with the
other driver. I might be able to try other cards as well.
