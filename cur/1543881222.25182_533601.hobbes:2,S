FYI, make headers_check seems to fail on this:
[carter@hoth linux-2.6]$ make headers_check
[snip]
   CHECK   include/linux/usb/cdc.h
   CHECK   include/linux/usb/audio.h
make[2]: *** No rule to make target `/src/linux-2.6/usr/include/linux/.check.sched.h', needed by 
`__headerscheck'.  Stop.
make[1]: *** [linux] Error 2
make: *** [headers_check] Error 2
[carter@hoth linux-2.6]$
This also fails if I have CONFIG_HEADERS_CHECK=y in my .config
unset CONFIG_HEADERS_CHECK and it builds just fine.
