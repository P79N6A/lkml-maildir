  Without this patch,

| 
| The original justification for cap_task_kill() was as follows:
| 
| 	check_kill_permission() does appropriate uid equivalence checks.
| 	However with file capabilities it becomes possible for an
| 	unprivileged user to execute a file with file capabilities
| 	resulting in a more privileged task with the same uid.
| 
| However now that cap_task_kill() always returns 0 (permission
| granted) when p->uid==current->uid, the whole hook is worthless,
| and only likely to create more subtle problems in the corner cases
| where it might still be called but return -EPERM.  Those cases
| are basically when uids are different but euid/suid is equivalent
| as per the check in check_kill_permission().
| 
| One example of a still-broken application is 'at' for non-root users.
| 
| This patch removes cap_task_kill().

 I've tested the -stable patch (no time to test this one, but it's
exactly the same patch), not sure if this applies to this but...
