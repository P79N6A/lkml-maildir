I now produced the "etheral" dumps and put them on:
http://wwwnlds.physik.tu-berlin.de/~amann/kmail_bug/kmail_etheral_cut_2.6.4
 
http://wwwnlds.physik.tu-berlin.de/~amann/kmail_bug/kmail_etheral_cut_2.6.6
together with the pertinent  "strace"s at:
http://wwwnlds.physik.tu-berlin.de/~amann/kmail_bug/kmail_trace_2.6.4_new
http://wwwnlds.physik.tu-berlin.de/~amann/kmail_bug/kmail_trace_2.6.6_new
I interpret the dump in the failing case with the 2.6.6 client as follows:
First the Filehandle for ".outbox.index" (0xdc36f60a) is delivered by a  
READDIRPLUS Reply (Frame 4 in  kmail_etheral_cut_2.6.6). Then the client does  
GETATTR, ACCESS, SETATTR, READ (Frames 100-114) without any problems. 
The client subsequnetly issues a WRITE and a COMMIT (Frame 741 + 751) command, 
which are still successful. But the immediadetly following GETATTR (Frame 
743) fails with ERR_STALE. 
In the case where the client is 2.6.4, the dumps look very similar, except 
that now a lot of the GETATTR Calls are missing. In particular the GETATTR 
which failed in the 2.6.6 case is not present, and therefore can not fail. 
In both cases the server was 2.4.25. Who is now wrong in this case, the client 
or the server? To me it looks now, as if the server needs to be fixed, but I 
am no expert.
