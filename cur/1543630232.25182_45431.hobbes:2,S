Subject: [PATCH] i386 arch subdivision into machine types for 2.5.15

Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This split is essentially the same as the one I did for 2.5.8 except that I've 
cleaned up setup_arch.h slightly (the other was, as I was told, "icky").  I 
didn't do any other alterations to setup.c because the projects list implies 
that Dave Jones and Patrick Mochel are going to be doing this, so I'll slide 
my changes in around this.
I've pulled visws.c out of i386/pci and put it in i386/visws.c, since it's 
really specific to visws and doing this also allows me to simplify the 
i386/pci/Makefile.
The other thing I haven't done (yet) is to document all the hooks and how they 
work; I'll try to do that shortly.

There's also a bitkeeper repository with all this in at
