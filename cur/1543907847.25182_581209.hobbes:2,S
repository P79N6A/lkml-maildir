   Oh.... that's something I should have thought about (shaking my
   head)
   I hope I found the the misconfigured part. I didn't look
   at /etc/inittab. It opens a getty on /dev/ttyS0. That
   might do the trick. Have to recompile my kernel right now with
   standard config to check this out.

   Well ... it doesn't seem to need the daemons but at least
   the kuro_boot  script or something similar has to be executed
   once sending the right init strings to the AVR or your system
   reboots after a few minutes at least on my box.
