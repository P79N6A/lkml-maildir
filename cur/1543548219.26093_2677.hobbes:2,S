Oh bat doodoo. In the first place you use a debug build with the debugger
built in for debugging. You run a real build without the debugger for
production. In the second place since you have the sense to do the
aforementioned good practice you keep in mind that there are interactions
involved to indicate whether the problem goes away or not and how the
problem manifestation changes with the debugger present. In the third
place if you are reduced to printk you can have even worse timing issues
than with a well constructed debugger.
If you have that well constructed debugger you have a patch to install it.
If there is a "make debugged" and "make nondebugged" command in
the kernel Makefile and the debugger is not patched in for most people
until they issue the "make debugged" command you have exactly what
you have now with the addition of a debugger for which there is a huge
incentive to maintain it.
Heck, run up proposed patches in the debugger, confirm your desk
analysis of what they do, THEN install the patches into the kernel
formally. (And for Ghu's sake make it a source level debugger if you
want it to work right.)

I built in the test points these tools attached to in each and every module
of each and every radio. Except obviously the simulator was used before
hand to predict circuit performance. If you design for proper testpoints
there is little or no affect on operation and a great improvement in ease
of maintenance and tuneup.

That design approach plus a good debugger can reach the finished line
of clean completed and debugged (to the same level) code quicker than
without the good debugger. The times I have most loved the debugger are
when the code generated is very different from the code laid down either
due to a typo I continually overlooked (I am human  -  I think) or a compiler
bug. Sometimes it actually adds time to development if I didn't NEED to run
that debugger based verification that what I intended is what appeared.
(Sadly I don't quite have the self-discipline to make that run EVERY time
and even worse sometimes I have not had the debugger to work with.)
So far I have noticed that the debuggers catch a wider range of issues
than the desk analysis.
