With this patch, we don't freeze it. :-)
We do something like "send a freeze request to this task, but don't care if it
doesn't freeze".
Now, IMHO, the correctness here is the question of for how long a task can be
in TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE it it's not stuck (eg. the resource needed is gone
indefinitely, like in NFS) and I think that's not very long.
For example, if the tasks sleeps on a mutex, then it waits for another task to
release the mutex (interrupt handlers don't use mutexes) and I don't know of
any realistic scenario in which it can last in that state throughout
freeze_processes().
