The first thing you want to do when playing with MMIO is to prevent the 
compiler from optimizing accesses to MMIO regions.
Using 'volatile' for each MMIO access is required, otherwise the actual 
asm code may just do a job that is different from the one you want to  
perform (btw, the readX/writeX stuff add the 'volatile' stuff for you).
If you are running your code on x86 machine, memory barriers should not be
needed since the CPU mostly enforces strong ordering for access to MMIO
regions. On other architectures, memory barriers may have to be used in
order to enforce proper ordering. 
I donnot have any idea on the cause of the lock-up. But you must keep in
mind that the actual machine code is very probably different from what the
C code is intended to do due to compiler optimizations.
So, it would be a lot more helpful to look into the generated asm code if
you want to have a chance to understand what actually happens.
