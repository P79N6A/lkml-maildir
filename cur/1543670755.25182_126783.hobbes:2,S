There are rpms for suse 8.1 on ftp.suse.com (i386 only for obvious
reasons).
BTW: With glibc 2.3 the modula-3 compiler bootstrap broke (due to
thread code changes as far I can see, I'm no m3 guru ...), so with
very recent linux distributions you likely have problems to build the
thing even on i386 (unless someone has fixed that in the meantime).
Old cvsup binaries continue to work through.

xfree86 + freebsd use it too.
