Yup... as far as I can tell there are no in-kernel users, and nobody
noticed that the MSI-X code didn't enable MSI-X properly until my
patch from last month.  My mthca driver:
    
https://openib.org/svn/gen2/branches/roland-merge/src/linux-kernel/infiniband/hw/mthca
seems to be one of the first attempts to use MSI/MSI-X.  I have some
uncommitted changes to match Long's patch -- without the patch the
semantics of free_irq() releasing an MSI-X vector make my driver code
very awkward.

I agree... I'd just really, really like to see Long's patch merged
first, since I've been waiting for it for a long time and my driver is
broken without it :)

Sounds good, although I don't know much about the low-level details of
interrupt vectors on either i386 or ia64.  Some way of exposing which
interrupts are "closest" to which CPUs would be a good thing too.
One thing that I would be a little concerned about is making the
numbers in /proc/interrupts too divorced from the underlying platform
interrupt code -- it seems that ACPI debugging is hard enough as it
is.
