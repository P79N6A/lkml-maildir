There's a threshold for the problem depending on the initial
size. This one fails:
	mke2fs -j -b 4096 /dev/<3GB-blockdev> 32768
	(mount + ext2online or resize2fs)
	kernel: JBD: resize2fs wants too many credits (1034 > 1024)
Add one block to the initial mke2fs (32768+1 == 32769) and the
problem is gone.
Without the -b 4096 there's another resize problem
	mke2fs -j /dev/loop1 2048
	mount /dev/loop1 /1
	resize2fs /dev/loop1
says:
	resize2fs 1.40-WIP (14-Nov-2006)
	Filesystem at /dev/loop1 is mounted on /1; on-line resizing required
	old desc_blocks = 1, new_desc_blocks = 12
	Performing an on-line resize of /dev/loop1 to 3072000 (1k) blocks.
	resize2fs: Invalid argument While trying to add group #256
and the kernel says:
May  7 15:36:08 lokka EXT3-fs warning (device loop1): verify_reserved_gdb: 
May  7 15:36:08 lokka reserved GDT 10 missing grp 1 (8202)
May  7 15:36:08 lokka  
After that, the filesystem has been resized to 2GB. I recall a 2G
(?) limit for ext3 resizing with 1k blocksize but trying the above with
4096 1k blocks seems to work. fsck says it's ok all the time.
