argh.
#define BT_STATUS	bt->io->inputb(bt->io, 0)
#define BT_CONTROL(x)	bt->io->outputb(bt->io, 0, x)
#define BMC2HOST	bt->io->inputb(bt->io, 1)
#define HOST2BMC(x)	bt->io->outputb(bt->io, 1, x)
#define BT_INTMASK_R	bt->io->inputb(bt->io, 2)
#define BT_INTMASK_W(x)	bt->io->outputb(bt->io, 2, x)
Please don't write macros which require that the caller have a particular
local variable of a particular name.
In fact, please don't write macros.
All the above would be perfectly nice as
static inline void bt_control(struct si_sm_data *bt, int val)
{
	bt->io->outputb(bt->io, val);
}
