Can suspend/resume be handled as power off/power on?
Taking that to the logical conclusion, there is no suspend/resume.
You suspend in order to preserve the system state. The problem
of mobility is no excuse to improperly implement suspension.
You can't expect something to work suspended which wouldn't work
if the system were powered on.
