Isn't it intended that, after an sysfs/kobject/device object is
unregistered that the thread doing the unregistering must not
dereference the memory associated with that object?
IOW, the sequence:
	allocate
	register	(refcount >= 2 after this completes)
	unregister
will automatically free the object once the last user has gone.
