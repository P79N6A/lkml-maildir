Hi Greg, 
and thanks for your answer.
I'll try to answer your question as good as I can.  Hihi.
I'm running a program called SatTrack that can write some information (like position, frequency, etc)
to any TTY or even a file.
Maybe you have run into this program or even using it.
Anyway... I needed some way of controlling my radios frequency aswell as my antennas automagicly from
the Linux box. The radios can be controlled via a serial port. The protocol they use is CI-V.
I've come so far that my "program / driver" gets the data (SatTrack writes to /dev/ci-v) and does some
formatting / protocol,etc.
I bet you and all you others out there know some other way to to this, but since I got interested in kernel programming /
device drivers I decided to try and solve my problem, and at the same time broaden my knowlage in Linux.  :-)
I'm still open for all suggestions though! Hihi :-)
You also wrote:
"That being said, you could have your driver implement the tty interface,
thereby looking like a serial port to any user applications."
I'm not sure I'm following you quite there. (Could be my understanding of english language), but please take your time
to explain. I'm here to learn!  :-)
Regards / Jörgen
