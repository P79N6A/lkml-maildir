Why not, instead of either plan above, just redefine OSRELEASE to be the version
of the kernel the config file was built against?  i.e. when you build a config
file, you need to specify a kernel to extract symbol information from, why not
grab the utsname from that kernel and use that to set OSRELEASE?  When you're
building a config file the running kernel on the system isn't really relevent
anyway.
