FWIW, I've tested the patch and it seems to be working just fine.  Thanks!
There is one exception, though it does not appear to be related to the 
mouse code or the patch, as far as I can tell.   Pressing or releasing 
the right-windows key sends a blank event to GPM (as reported by 'mev') 
causing the mouse cursor to reappear.  If I use "showkey -s" to tell me 
the scancode, nothing happens.  The key is evidently bound in the kernel 
table, else I'd see the obligatory PRINTK encouraging me to bind it.  So 
something is intercepting the key and sending it to GPM.   
Experimentally, it appears as if the key press is delivered only if it 
has not been pressed for roughly 3 seconds (256 Jiffies???).
