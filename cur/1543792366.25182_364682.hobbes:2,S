The generic_cont_expand() is too generic.
If "size" is block boundary, generic_cont_expand() expands the
->i_size to "size + 1", after it, the caller of it will truncate to
"size" by vmtruncate().
This sequence is not need if ->prepare_write() is cont_prepare_write().
The cont_prepare_write() will just fill the blocks with zero until
"size" if blocks is not allocated yet.
FAT is using cont_parepare_write(), so for avoiding the above extra
work, is using own version.
Probably, this version is generic only for cont_parepare_write().
Thanks.
