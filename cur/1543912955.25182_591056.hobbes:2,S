The following is a series of patches related to Unionfs, which include three
small VFS/fsstack patches and one eCryptfs patch; the rest are Unionfs
patches.  The patches here represent several months of work and testing
under various conditions, especially low-memory, SMP, and preemption
situations with an assortment of lower systems: ext2/3/4, xfs, reiserfs,
nfs, jffs2, ramfs, tmpfs, cramfs, and squashfs.
You can pull from 'master' branch of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jsipek/unionfs.git

Linus's tree, but the remainder depends on them.
