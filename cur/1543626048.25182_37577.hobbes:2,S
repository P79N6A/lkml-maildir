Erik,
I can't say from here. My guess is that the chipset has an extension to
the ATA standard that allows hot plugging. Your CDrom behaves like a
normal IDE device, which doesn't mean it is one :) For your hotpluggable
device support, we'll need info about the chipset your laptop uses, and
the cdrom drive. Maybe Dell is willing to help us out here.
