The evidence is that for the most part the bad guys don't know about the
bug and the majority of the bad guys are not skilled enough to write
some of the complex exploits. They also automate extensively so given an
exploit can make very fast very effective use of it. There is an entire
field of economics and game theory tied up in this as well as papers by
some in the field who look at computer security models this way.
If you are a member of the full disclosure camp then fine, but please cc
vendor-sec when you publish the hole just in case Linus loses the email
and so vendors know too and can plan appropriately.
