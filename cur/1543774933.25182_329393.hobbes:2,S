I just tried to compile the Linux Kernel version 2.6.11.12
with the most excellent Intel C compiler. It said
net/bridge/netfilter/ebt_log.c(91): remark #592: variable "u" is used before 
its value is set
        printk(" IP tos=0x%02X, IP proto=%d", u.iph.tos,
                                              ^
I agree with the compiler. Suggest code rework.
Regards
David Binderman
