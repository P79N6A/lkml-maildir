A penal system could be created, for example if someone is caught
introducing a bug, he will have to choose three additional reports
from bugzilla and analyze/fix them ;)

8 now, someone just sent a private mail about bindings for the Pliant
(never heard of it) language.

I think you are wrong there.  You don't appreciate all the complexity
FUSE _lacks_ by not being network transparent.  Just look at the error
text to errno conversion muck that v9fs has.  And their problems with
trying to do generic uid/gid mappings.

It would mean adding a plethora of extensions to the 9P protocol, that
would take away all it's beauty.  I think you should realize that
these are different interfaces for different purposes. There may be
some overlap, but not enough to warrant trying to massage them into
one big ball.

Do you promise?  I can do a resplit and submit to Linus, if that takes
some load off you.
Thanks,
