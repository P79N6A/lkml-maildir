That's a very good question.  The tdfxfb module has no parameters.  It would be
ideal if the tdfxfb mainatiner would add some MODULE_PARM lines for all the
parameters and move the code from tdfxfb_setup that does work into tdfxfb_init.
I think a valid work-around for you is to use fbset after you load the module
to set the resolution.  Does that work?
