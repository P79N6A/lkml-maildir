Hello, everyone, in my loop device I want to use
different keys to en/decrypt the file contents and the
metadata of directories/file names information. But
how can I differentiate these two types of data in the
loop device? The loop device just cares about the
block. But the metadata of directories/file names
information is just the file system information. Any
idea about this? Thanks in advance.
Michael
