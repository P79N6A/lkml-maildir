 Not working for me. G550 driving Samsung SyncMaster 171s (LCD).
It locked system several times in the past when switching between XFree
and fb console.
 I was told to use exact resolution and color depth wi fbcon and X.
In my case, it's 1280x1024-16bpp. It is working great in X, but
fbcon do not work - all I get is a black screen and lock when
I try to blinfly run XFree.
