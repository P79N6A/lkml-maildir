Hmm...
dunno if you got this right. There are maximal 256 syscalls possible,
and, right -- exactly this amount of syscalls is in the entrytable. But
alotalotalot of them are defined as sys_ni_syscall (not yet
implemented).
I think there is still some space for enhancements. See
arch/i386/kernel/entry.S.
