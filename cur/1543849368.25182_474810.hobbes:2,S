Available in the sense that the page allocator can allocate from them. 
Will's console output shows that all memory of node 0 is allocated and not 
available.

The page allocator must be running and able to serve pages from the boot 
node. This fails for some reason and the slab cannot bootstrap. The memory 
not available is the first guess. Could you trace the allocation in the 
page allocator (__alloc_pages) when the slab attempts to bootstrap and 
figure out why exactly the allocation fails?
