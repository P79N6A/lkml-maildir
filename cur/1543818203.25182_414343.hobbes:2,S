Following your logic through, It seems that you are advocating 
broadcasting *all* ARP packets on *all* link local addresses.  That 
would mean that on a 192.168.* switched Ethernet network with DHCP that 
twice as many ARP packets would be broadcast.
I don't think that is a good idea.  On networks with DHCP or statically 
allocated addresses, it would be a hard sell to tell people that they 
have to broadcast *all* ARP traffic even though there are neither 
standards that require nor suggest such action.
The scope parameter, as far as I can tell, is used to make routing 
decisions.  Overloading it to also implement the RFC 3927 ARP 
broadcasting requirement would result in generation of unnecessary 
network traffic in configurations that are probably the majority of 
Linux deployments.

The converse is not true.  And that is my problem with this idea.

I could see adding an additional interface attribute that specifies link 
local, and then testing that.  But that adds substantially more overhead 
as you would have to allocate space for the attribute somewhere, and 
have extra code to allow setting/querying of the attribute from user space.
The requirement of RFC 3927 is very tightly targeted.  My patch does 
only what is required, no more.  It does not change ARP behavior for 
commonly deployed configurations.

It may be beside your point, I happen to think that it has some relevance.
