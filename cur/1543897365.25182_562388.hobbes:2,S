Speaking as another OSS driver author and maintainer, who ACK'd the move 
to ALSA...
In Linux we typically do not do two APIs and codebases for the same 
purpose.  If we do, like sys_mmap and sys_mmap2, it's an older legacy 
interface that never changes, that we are moving people AWAY from, and a 
newer interface.
I see no reason to change from the path at which upstream has arrived: 
OSS is a legacy API that's frozen in time, and ALSA provides the new stuff.
If you have ALSA criticisms, the right thing to do is fix ALSA. 
Upstream OSS was a dead-end code duplication & maintenance nightmare.  I 
know.  I was doing some of that maintenance and driver writing.
