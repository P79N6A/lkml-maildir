Utterly wrong - you didn't understand the problem.  Please take the time
to read my email.
It's the fact that I _am_ CC'd on replies, so I get one message from LKML
one from the original poster, maybe one via another mailing list if it's
also copied there.  Add that in to the mix of all the other mail hitting
my MTA and the probability for the machine to exhaust it's limited VM is
very high.
Give me a way to stop people CC'ing me on replies and I'll happily remove
the header.  Unfortunately there isn't, so I can't.
