yes. I tried the following combinations with PREEMPT_RT:
- IRQ 0 prio 40, IRQ 3 (soundcard) prio 98
- IRQ 0 prio 99, IRQ 3 prio 98
all other IRQ's at prios around 40-50 (default or set explicitly to 40).
What is the recommended setting for IRQ 0? I thought in this typical
thread-wakeup-by-IRQ scenario the scheduler is "shorted" anyways when an IRQ
occurs, so IRQ 0's prio shouldn't really matter.
