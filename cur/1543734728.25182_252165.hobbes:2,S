1) cond_resched should become a noop if CONFIG_PREEMPT=y
   (cond_resched_lock of course should still unlock/relock if
    need_resched() is set, but not __cond_resched).
2) all Ingo's new and old might_sleep should be converted to
   cond_resched (or optionally to cond_resched_costly, see point 5).
3) might_sleep should return a debug statement.
4) cond_resched should call might_sleep if need_resched is not set if
   CONFIG_PREEMPT=n is disabled, and it should _only_ call might_sleep
   if CONFIG_PREEMPT=y after we implement point 1.
5) no further config option should exist (if we really add an option
   it should be called CONFIG_COND_RESCHED_COSTLY of similar to 
   differentiate scheduling points in fast paths (like spinlock places
   with CONFIG_PREEMPT=n) (so you can choose between cond_resched() and
   cond_resched_costly())
I recommended point 2,3,4,5 already (a few of them twice), point 1 (your
point) looks lower prio (CONFIG_PREEMPT=y already does an overkill of
implicit need_resched() checks anyways).
> Why would someone who really cares about latency not enable preempt?
to avoid lots of worthless cond_resched in all spin_unlock and to avoid
kernel crashes if some driver is not preempt complaint?
I've a better question for you, why would someone ever disable
CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY? That config option is a nosense as far as I
can tell. If something it should be renamed to
"CONFIG_I_DON_T_WANT_TO_RUN_THE_OLD_KERNEL_CODE" ;)
