OK, I've attached the kern.log file, which should explain the setup and 
has some call traces.  The server has about 300-350 MBs of RAM, 500 MBs 
of swap, and typically uses about 2-300MBs of swap at any given time.
It's recorded load average is typically between 0.1 and 0.2, at times up 
to 1.0.
I've got some additional kern.log files if you're interested.
HTH,
Morten
