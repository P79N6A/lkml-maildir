Sorry for the build errors, my test build scripts obviously were missing
a critical kernel variant to test build.  I've fixed that omission and
increased the test build matrix significantly:
arch-i386-allmodconfig
arch-i386-allnoconfig
arch-i386-allyesconfig
arch-i386-defconfig
arch-i386-nomodconfig
arch-i386-nosmp
arch-i386-randconfig-1
arch-i386-randconfig-2
arch-i386-randconfig-3
arch-i386-randconfig-4
arch-i386-randconfig-5
arch-i386-smp
arch-x86_64-allmodconfig
arch-x86_64-allnoconfig
arch-x86_64-allyesconfig
arch-x86_64-nomodconfig
arch-x86_64-nosmp
arch-x86_64-randconfig-1
arch-x86_64-randconfig-2
arch-x86_64-randconfig-3
arch-x86_64-randconfig-4
arch-x86_64-randconfig-5
arch-x86_64-smp
A corrected patch follows.
Thanks,
Mike
