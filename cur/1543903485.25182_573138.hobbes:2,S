And I also looked over these three after your resends.

Like you said you built an allmodconfig, everything should be OK.
[ Except for modules that didn't get included in allmodconfig because
your arch might not have supported it -- but even then, your patches
are obviously correct and will only expose issues elsewhere if we do
see any build breakage, but which isn't likely in any case. ]
So the entire series is reviewed and looks good to me :-)
Thanks,
