I find this very strange because if your program accepts other connections,
I don't see how it could "select" some connections and ignore others. The
accept() call returns the next connection(s) in the listen queue. Stupid
question : are you sure that you don't miss anything in the loop around
accept() ? eg: reinitialise one error code or anything which could prevent
accept() from being further called after you have successfully done several
accept() at once ? I'm personnally using epoll in level triggered mode
in haproxy, which often does multiple accept() per call on very high loads
(>10k sessions/s), and although I've encountered difficult beginnings with
epoll, it's rock solid now.

I would suggest trying 2.6.16 first to see if it may be related to a bug
which has been fixed since then, and otherwise, some test code would help.
