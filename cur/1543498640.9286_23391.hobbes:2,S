Ok, I'm on to something here, perhaps...
(This is cross-posted to linux-kernel, which I only follow via. the
 archives. The post on 3c575 I'm referring to was posted on linux-net.)
Can anyone confirm, that it is not possible to ping machines running
the 2.2.9 kernel with ping packets of size 1475 ?
I'm unable to do this, both on the laptop from/to my previous post, and
from/to another box with a well-functioning nic also running 2.2.9.
I guess this is an IP bug in the 2.2.9 kernel.
Still, I have severe problems with the 3c575. I can lock up the machine
by flood-pinging 1474 byte packets at it, etc. etc.  But it seems the
1475 oddity was not because of that driver.
