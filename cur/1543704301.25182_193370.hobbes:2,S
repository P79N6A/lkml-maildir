Hi all,
This is a proposed patch to alter the conditions under which the PCILynx
message is displayed while configuring Linux 2.6. The way it is now, a
user with PCI and I2C both disabled will see a message stating that
"PCILynx requires I2C". If the user goes to the I2C section and selects
I2C, then comes back to the IEEE 1394 section, the message will have
disappeared (because I2C isn't missing anymore) but the PCILynx option
will not show (because PCI is still not selected).
I think it might be confusing, so I suggest that the message shouldn't
be displayed at all if PCI isn't selected. And here's a simple patch
that does just this. Built against and tested on Linux 2.6.2-rc1.
Thanks for your attention.
