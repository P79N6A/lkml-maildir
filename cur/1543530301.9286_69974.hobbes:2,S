I can't imagine how this could work or be useful.  It appears just to
add a bazillion soft links in the kernel tree.  The tags file uses
relative path names so that if you cd down into, say fs/nfs, and try to
use the linked tags file you propose by tagging to nfs_writepage_sync,
you'll see (in vim):
	File "./fs/nfs/write.c" does not exist
Do what I do and just sit in the toplevel dir and edit files
including the pathnames:
	vi fs/nfs/write.c
	vi -t nsf_writepage_sync
If you really can't stand that, you can
	:set tags=tags,../tags,../../tags,../../../tags
to have the editor go searching around for the tags file.
Is your vi/ctags setup somehow different?
