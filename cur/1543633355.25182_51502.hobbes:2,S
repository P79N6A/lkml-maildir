Well, didn't someone just find a bug where egcs-1.1.2 falls down on x86
in an important area?

Well, the warning (at least from what I've seen) is when you do:
"In " __FUNCTION__ " something bad happened\n", which __func__ just
won't do.  Doing:
"In %s something bad happened\n", __FUNCTION__
Is OK[1].
