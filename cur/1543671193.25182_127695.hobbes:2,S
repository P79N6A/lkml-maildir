If I might offer a course of action, if you put thing which are *fixes* in
the bk releases, and hold *changes* for the next -pre, it might allow
people to grab bk's to fix the quickly caught things in a new pre, without
being hit with major changes which might decrease stability.
Clearly any pre is a risk, but there always seem to be errors of the "XXX
doesn't compile because of typo" type. That way Alan could put all new IDE
code in each -pre and Andre and others could put fixes in the bk's until
it worked. => JOKING!! <== but you get the idea.
I'd love to see this in 2.5 as well, just to encourage people to use it!
I'm not even going to suggest that, there would be the usual flamewar.
