   Yes, it's possible to write any app pretty with static memory needs.
This just means allocating much memory at the start, restricting the work
it does or both. I certainly won't hestitate to say that I would be able
to write such a program. You'd also use mlockall() to make sure you had
stack available for processing when needed etc.
