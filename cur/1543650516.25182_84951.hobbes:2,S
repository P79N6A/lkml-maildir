Subject: Are x86 trap gate handlers safe for preemption?

Consider an exception handler like vector 7, device_not_available:
ENTRY(device_not_available)
        pushl $-1                       # mark this as an int
        SAVE_ALL
        movl %cr0, %eax
        testl $0x4, %eax                # EM (math emulation bit)
        jne device_not_available_emulate
        preempt_stop
Since this is invoked via a trap gate and not an interrupt gate,
what's preventing this code from being preempted and resumed on
another CPU before the read from %cr0? Another example is the
machine_check vector (also trap gate) whose handlers access MSRs.
I'm sure this actually works, but I don't see how.
