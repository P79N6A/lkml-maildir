  Well, the actual usecase, which triggered me to hack that, was a
need to write a "burn out" test script for suspend/resume for a
battery-powered ARM device (PDA), which would do suspend/resume cycle
thousands of times. And wakeup alarm is obvious, if not only, source of
automated resume events.
  Of course, I started by trying existing solutions - e.g. there's an
"atd" implementation which uses /dev/rtc, but I found it having awful
latency (>2s), then I tried to write simple C app to set alarm via
ioctl(), just to find alarm IRQs are shutdown on its exit.
  But anyway, I'm that kind of guy who think that debugging and
diagnostics are important things for *production* system, so such
sysfs alarm support just as precious as /proc/interrupts and /proc/dma
(ah, ARM Linux maintainer declined to fix broken /proc/dma support for
ARM, I forgot ;-( ).

  Oh my! I couldn't even think this can be idiosyncrasy of specific
implementation. Oh, what a world... ;-)

  I would agree with such behavior. But what's clear that the
behavior, whatever it is, should be consistent across implementations,
or its just a mess ;-(.

  Yes, I mentioned, that for PXA/SA, my patch becomes actually useful
only after applying your patch (plus, with fixed TODO: here's what
I applied to handhelds.org tree:
http://handhelds.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/linux/kernel26/drivers/rtc/rtc-sa1100.c.diff?r1=1.5&r2=1.6&f=h
).
  That of course doesn't mean sysfs alarm support patch depends on
rtc-sa1100.c patch in any way (it's just PXA/SA won't actually wake up,
but sysfs patch for showing/storing alarm properties obviously doesn't
depend on any specific implementation).

  Yes, both of these are, or may be, true. That was really a draft,
initial version. I probably don't have knowledge/resources to make it
"right", but it would be nice if it prompted someone with more
experience/resources to tweak in such support, as well as the problems
outlined above...
