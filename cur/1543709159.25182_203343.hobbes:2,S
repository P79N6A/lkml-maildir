I'd like.  
What I worry about with transforming boot_ioremap to __va are two things.
1) It is clear I haven't broken code that uses boot_ioremap if I don't
   touch them.  At least not that way.
2) There is a weird case at 4G where an exception is generated if
   you cross that boundary.  I forget if it is logical or physical
   address.  Keeping the boot_ioremap interface I can at least try and
   avoid that.
   If I can get a clear picture of what I am avoiding and be certain
   that it won't happen I will remove all objections.  But better safe
   than sorry at least for a start.
