well, i share your desire for lower latencies but this is what the
semantics of softirqs require.
but it's really easy to break out of softirq processing early and
restart it later. All it needs in net_rx_action() is to:
	if (softirq_defer && need_resched())
		goto softnet_break;
since the network softirq code is already latency-aware. The same
'lock-break'-alike methods can be used for other softirq code too.
