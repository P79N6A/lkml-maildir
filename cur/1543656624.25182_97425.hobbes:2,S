Related thought:
  One of the things that we are trying to do is to automate 
patch testing.
  The PLM (www.osdl.org/plm) takes every patch that it gets
and does a quick "Does it compile test".  Right now there
are only 4 kernel configuration files that we try but we are
going to be adding more.  We could expand this to 100's 
if needed as it would just be a matter of adding additional
hardware to make the compiles go faster in parallel.
  Here is the example of the output from a baseline kernel.
http://www.osdl.org/cgi-bin/plm?module=patch_info&patch_id=986
  A patch would look the same.  The PASS reports are really
short and the FAIL reports just give you the configuration 
files and the tail of the output from the kernel make.
 We've talked to a couple of system vendors about expanding
this to take the configurations that have passed and running
them on their 10's of hardware platforms of interest and we 
would be very happy to expand this to a very large number of
configurations of all sorts.
