This may not be the problem.  I just got 2.6.0-test3 booting 
after similar error messages by changing my .config file. 
using root=0303 didn't make it boot.
Not sure which changes made it boot.  
Most likely, it's compiling ext3 into kernel (not a module).
2.4.20 kernels fell back to ext2 when mounting an ext3 partition.
BUT, I made that change once and it didn't work....
or maybe I forgot to install it.  I'm still working thought the
combinations.
