Subject: [PATCH 084/114] x86/Voyager: clean up BROKEN Kconfig reference
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/28/572

CONFIG_BROKEN has been removed from the upstream kernel years ago,
but X86_VOYAGER still had a stale reference to it - remove it.
