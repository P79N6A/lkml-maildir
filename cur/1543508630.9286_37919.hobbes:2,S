Hi Ulrich, et al,
I just saw the first instance of what might be serial corruption last night
running 2.3.16.  The kernel dumped "VJ Decompression Error" onto my console
while I was using PPP over an error-correcting modem link.  I have no idea if
this was due to the serial stream or something in the TCP layer; but if the
former, and the serial code from 2.3 was back-ported to 2.2, then perhaps the
errors are related.
Kris
