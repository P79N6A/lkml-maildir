Great think :)
I'd actually like to see it mainline tree (I prefer vanilla kernel
instead of distro specific).

I didn't have the time for an deeper study yet, but as you already
mentioned, there're lots of limitations which can make it harmful:
as soon as interfaces chance, you're in *big* trouble. There should
be a way for finding them (automatically). Maybe extract the 
interface signatures (including structs!) so some appropriate place
next to the kernel, so they can be checked before (re)loading the
module.
Ah, of course you can't change code that's not an dynamic module :(
Even this goes OT now - I'd really prefer more things in userland,
eg. network- or synthetic filesystems, crypt stuff, etc - so 
there would be less to update within the kernel ;-o
