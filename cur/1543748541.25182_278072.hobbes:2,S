I seem to remember having a rationale for that, but I'm fine with your

Fair enough. s/__add/mix/, please.

It won't work as in we'll still get duplicates? I don't see how that
happens. The polynomial for the output pools is dense enough that even
on the very next one word mix, we're getting 96 bits changed in the
output and 32 new ones shifted in. And we're always doing at least
three adds for each pull.
It's still suboptimal, perhaps, but I'd rather mix more in
init_std_data. In fact, I was hoping to abolish the pool clearing
function in favor of just init_std_data, as there's not much utility
in going back to a known state here. Let's address this separately.
