Yep.

Yep (tested with wodim from debburn, effectively the same thing)

Device type    : Removable CD-ROM
Version        : 5
Response Format: 2
Capabilities   :
Vendor_info    : 'PHILIPS '
Identification : 'DVD+-RW SDVD8820'
Revision       : 'AD15'
Device seems to be: Generic mmc2 DVD-R/DVD-RW.
Using generic SCSI-3/mmc   CD-R/CD-RW driver (mmc_cdr).
Driver flags   : MMC-3 SWABAUDIO BURNFREE
Supported modes: TAO PACKET SAO SAO/R96P SAO/R96R RAW/R16 RAW/R96P RAW/R96R
This is on my laptop (Dell Inspiron 640m). I won't have access to 
another system to test this there until next week.
The nutty app I was using for burning is Brasero, a GNOME app which does 
some SG_IO directly with the drive. (I guess it has some bad error 
handling and doesn't realise when some I/O path has failed)
I have narrowed down the exact command submission which causes those 
nasty messages in dmesg. The function which submits this is named 
"brasero_medium_get_page_2A_write_speed_desc".
The test program that I've attached can now reproduce this error every 
time it is run. The output is:
	result 0
	check sense data:
	72 0b 47 00 00 00 00 0e 09 0c 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 0a 00
I get the same output and dmesg errors even when there is no media in 
the drive.
I have had a quick look at the SCSI command being submitted there, and 
don't see anything wrong.
What next?
