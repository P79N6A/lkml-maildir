Andrew, thanks for the review...

Actually, there are no ifdefs at all (unless there are some
auto-generated ones I don't know about).  The only function of the config
option is to allow a preset without using the command line parameter. I
agree that the command line parameter alone is enough. I'm not an actual
user of this code, though, so perhaps Tim or someone else can comment if
the config option serves a useful purpose for them.

Will do. I actually purposely avoided making "gratuitous" changes to
existing code, but I definitely appreciate consistency so I'll happily
clean things up a bit.
Thanks for your feedback. Here's a patch implementing your suggestions.
