Just to demonstrate the clean up possibilities by removing es7000
and numaq here's a sample patch series. It doesn't actually remove
the es7000/numaq code, but just marks them broken and then
removes all the hooks only used by them. I'm not actually sure
I caught all the now unused hooks, there are probably now more.
Also I think there's still some other NUMAQ only code in smpboot.c
that could be exercised.
This removes 6 hooks and 2 fields out of struct genapic (out of 26
hooks, a reduction of ~23%!) 
The first three patches are independent cleanups that should
be applied anyways.
This gives a nice generic cleanup:
