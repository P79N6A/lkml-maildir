Booted my machine on 2.3.22 this evening, and it locked up hard just
after complaining about a kernel bug in sched.c at line 573.  The
context is as follows:
asmlinkage void schedule(void)
{   
        struct schedule_data * sched_data;
	struct task_struct *prev, *next, *p;
	struct list_head *tmp;
	int this_cpu, c;
	if (!current->active_mm) BUG();
	if (tq_scheduler)
		goto handle_tq_scheduler;
(...)
As far as what was happening at the time, I had just booted the machine
and it was starting up syslogd and klogd.
