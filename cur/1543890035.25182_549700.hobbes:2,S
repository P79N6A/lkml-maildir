My point was that I cannot recall a single real oops bug found by the compile
time checking.
We had a few in the past, but since we poison init data after boot they all tended
to be found quickly anyways.
But the warnings just seem to require endless changes and bogus changes
(randomly moving code which was actually ok because it only called 
in the init case).
