It's an ACPI issue.
As far as I understand: If there has been bus master activity in the last
xx(~30?!?) ms, C3 and deeper sleep states must not be triggered.
If running into it, the system just freezes without any further output
or response.

I heard on this machine battery lasts half an hour longer since
C4 state is used, hopefully we can get some more minutes by using it
more often and longer ...

The sleep time history could be enough?
I don't know how to calc C1 state sleep time (from drivers/acpi/processor_idle.c):
		/*
                 * TBD: Can't get time duration while in C1, as resumes
		 *      go to an ISR rather than here.  Need to instrument
		 *      base interrupt handler.
		 */
It probably would help to go to deeper states faster.
Whatabout reprogramming timer interrupt for C1 (latency==0), so that it comes out after e.g. 1 ms again.
If it really stayed sleeping for 1ms, 5 times, the machine is really idle and deeper
states are adjusted after sleep time and C-state latency...
(Or only disable timer interrupt after C1 slept long enough X times?)
