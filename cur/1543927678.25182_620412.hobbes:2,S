In all the cases that I know of where ppl are using what could
be considered real-time I/O (e.g. media environments where they
do real-time ingest and playout from the same filesystem) the
real-time ingest processes create the files and do pre-allocation
before doing their I/O. This I/O can get held up behind another
process that is not real time that has issued log I/O. 
Given there is no I/O priority inheritence and having log I/O stall
will stall the entire filesystem, we cannot allow log I/O to
stall in real-time environments. Hence it must have the highest
possible priority to prevent this.
Cheers,
Dave.
