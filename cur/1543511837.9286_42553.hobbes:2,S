This is how it operates now. /proc/bus/usb/dev has all of the USB
devices. You open and use ioctl to send raw commands to the device.
The problem with it now is permissions. I want to send raw commands to
my USB camera. There's no reason for a kernel driver. However, you can
change permissions on /proc files and keep it persistant.
