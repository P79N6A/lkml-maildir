Which says

Which is not legal IP, and is why you are having problems.

So stick the address on eth0 not on lo since its not a loopback but an eth0
address, then use arpfilter so you don't arp for the invalid magic shared IP
address, or NAT it, or it may work to do
         ip route add nexthop-addr src my-virtual-addr dev eth0 scope local onlink
         ip route add default src my-virtual-addr via nexthop-addr dev eth0 scope global
if you have no other routes getting in the way, especially old style ifconfig ones
