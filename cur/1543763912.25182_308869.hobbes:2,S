Breaking the lock is not really possible at that point, and it doesnt 
look too easy to make that path preemptable either. (To make it 
preemptable rsv_lock would need to become a semaphore (this could be 
fine, as it's only used when a new reservation window is created).)
The hard part is the seqlock - the read side is performance-critical, 
maybe it could be solved via a preemptable but still scalable seqlock 
variant that uses a semaphore for the write side? It all depends on what 
the scalability impact of using a semaphore for the new-window code 
would be.
the best longterm solution for these types of tradeoffs seems to be to 
add a locking primitive that is a spinlock on !PREEMPT kernels and a 
semaphore on PREEMPT kernels. I.e. not as drastic as a full PREEMPT_RT 
kernel, but good enough to make latency-critical codepaths of ext3 
preemptable, without having to hurt scalability on !PREEMPT. The 
PREEMPT_RT kernel has all the 'compile-time type-switching' 
infrastructure for such tricks, all that needs to be changed to switch a 
lock's type is to change the spinlock definition - all the 
spin_lock(&lock) uses can remain unchanged. (The same method is used on 
PREEMPT_RT to have 'dual-type' spinlocks.)
the same thing could then also be used for things like the mm lock, and 
other longer-held locks that PREEMPT would like to see preemptable. It 
would also be a good first step towards merging the PREEMPT_RT 
infrastructure ;-) I'll cook up something.
