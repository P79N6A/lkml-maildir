Clets would execute in userspace, like signal handlers, but under the 
special schedule() handler. In that way chains happens by the mean of 
natural C code, and access to userspace variables happen by the mean of 
natural C code too (not with special syscalls to manipulate userspace 
memory). I'm not a big fan of chains of syscalls for the reasons I 
already explained, but at least clets (or whatever name) has a way lower 
cost for the programmer (easier to code than atom chains), and for the 
kernel (no need of all that atom handling stuff, no need of limited 
cond/jump interpreters in the kernel, and no need of nightmare compat 
code).
