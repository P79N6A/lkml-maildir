So wrong. If no driver is associated, like early, in that case, we
must return -ENODEV, instead of calling modprobe in a loop. It's a
built-in device, and it's easy to fix.
Again, please start to think about, it's all contained in the kernel,
and the kernel is wrong. Claiming userspace is guilty to triggering
this kernel bug does not help anything.
