Subject: [PATCH] possible bug in i2c-algo-bit's inb function

Hi,
while writing a driver for a cardbus card which is supposed to use the
bit-banging algorithm I noticed that communication with the I2C slave
(Philips TDA10046) would fail without this patch. It forces SDA to high
for every bit in i2c_inb() instead of once per byte. Can this patch go
into the mainline kernel or will this break other drivers? I am using
Kernel version 2.6.10.
