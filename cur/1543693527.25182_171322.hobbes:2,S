Is software RAID5 stable in Linux 2.6.0-test7?  A while back I tried
running a software RAID5 with a 2.6.0-test kernel, and had to spend
the evening running fsck.  The corruption could have been caused by
something other than the RAID layer.  So, is it considered safe to use
RAID5 in 2.6.0 kernels?  I sort of dislike the try and see approach
with matters like this.
