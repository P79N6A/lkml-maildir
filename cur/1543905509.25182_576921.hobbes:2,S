The defragfs tool was an unported holdover from OS/2, which is why it
was removed.  There never was a working Linux version.  I have some
ideas to improve jfs allocation to avoid fragmentation problems, but jfs
isn't my full-time job anymore, so I can't promise anything.  I'm not
sure about the corruption claims.  I'd like to hear some specifics on
that.
Anyway, for enterprise use, I couldn't recommend jfs, since there is no
full-time maintainer.
Thanks,
Shaggy
