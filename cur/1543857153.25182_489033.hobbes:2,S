So what does such a button do? I am confused here...

Yes, I think the driver should just create an input device. You may
provide a generic implementation for a polled button and have driver
instantiate it but I do not think that a single RFkill button device
is needed - you won't have too many of them in a single system anyway
(I think you will normally have 1, 2 at the most).

I think it is almost the same. I also want support RF devices that can
control radio state but lack a button. This is covered by mixing 2)
and 3) in kernel and for userspace looks exactly like 2) with a
button.
