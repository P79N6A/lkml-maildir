The API does not permit this implementation.  The Unix98 way to get a
pty is
	mfd = open("/dev/ptmx", O_RDWR);
	grantpt(mfd);
	unlockpt(mfd);
	sfd = open(ptsname(mfd), O_RDWR);
This can't possibly work with BSD ptys, so there is an extension.  If
you replace the first open with
	mfd = getpt();
then it is documented to work no matter what sort of ptys you have.
But notice that we don't look for the slave till later.  At that point
it is too late to back up and switch to BSD ptys - the user already
has the master fd squirreled away.
You cannot look for the slave inside getpt() because it may not exist
at that point.  devptsfs creates slaves when someone opens them
successfully.  But until unlockpt() is called, no one, not even root,
can open the slave.
Even if we could know at getpt() time whether the Unix98 slave
existed, we would still need to know if devfs or devptsfs were in
use.  If neither one is in use, grantpt() has to run a setuid helper
program that resets the permissions of the slave.  We don't want to do
that if it can be avoided, since it is an expensive and dangerous
operation.
