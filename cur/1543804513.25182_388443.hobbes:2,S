Also it's not Neil direct problem, since we are at it, the weakest point
about Linux MD is currently that ...
there is no production quality U320 SCSI driver for Linux to run MD over !
In the U160 category, the symbios driver passed all possible stress tests
(partly bad drives that require the driver to properly reset and restart),
but in the U320 category, neither the Fusion not the AIC79xx did.
