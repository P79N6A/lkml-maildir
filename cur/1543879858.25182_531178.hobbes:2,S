Thanks for your detailed answer, it helps a lot !

I think I got the picture now, thanks again.
Just to be sure I understand, it seems to me that your point 2) and 3)
are 2 different approaches to do the same thing, aren't they ?
If so I can only implement 2) since it seems to me better than the
last one (it better uses genirq layer).
Thanks !
