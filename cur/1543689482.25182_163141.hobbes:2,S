I don't see why you can't clear the flag: the call to ->populate will
change every page and pte_file to correspond with the linear page
offsets, which is all that !VM_NONLINEAR indicates.
However, it _is_ wrong to clear VM_NONLINEAR before the call to
->populate() has finished, with Andrew's patch which uses
downgrade_write().  Instead, the clear must come after ->populate()
has finished.

Agreed.  I put it because the old futex has it as a side effect of
get_user_pages().  It can go.

Feel free to think up a better hash that isn't slow.  Two iterations
of hash_long() would be a good hash, but slower.

Ew.

Well spotted.

The important things are that the futex is queued prior to checking
curval, the requested page won't change (it's protected by mmap_sem),
and any parallel waker changes the word prior to waking us.
You made me notice a rather subtle memory ordering condition, though.
We must issue the read after queuing the futex.  There needs to be a
smp_rmb() after queuing and before the read, because the spin_unlock()
barrier only constrains earlier reads, not later ones.
Thanks for all your great insights,
