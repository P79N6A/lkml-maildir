Viro, I think you have an attitude problem here. "Don't be ridiculous",
"Rubbish", "<shrug>" don't sound very constructive or at least
encouraging.
Over the years it was proved that Linux kernel can be tailored for a very
large number of unexpected and very strange needs. IBM put it into
watches, NASA sent it to space, it is exists in oil wells and so on. I
think that the possibilities offered by Linux kernel are limited only by
the knowledge, imagination and will of every of us. Linux itself was once
a very insignificant and unreliable kernel and many other serious Unix and
Unix-like alternative were available. Still, it is prevailing today because
some peoples believed in what they did.
Especially to your point, should I mention that there are patches that
avoid buffer-overflows? Or that there are patches for gcc that add bound
check to arrays in C?
These peoples are trying to solve a problem. If you have some expertise in
the area of the problem, it might be much useful to come with positive
ideas about how the encountered problems can be solved, instead of
dismissing with so much ease the effort done to solve a real problem.
Come on, I'm sure you can Think Positive (TM).
