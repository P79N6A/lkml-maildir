The same problem arrises with Mips Disk Volume headers as used by MIPS,
SGI, SNI and a few other companies.  The DVH is located on block zero
and for disks without a PC style boot block you may end up with a disk
which has two valid partition tables but no way to distinguish which one
is actually valid.
