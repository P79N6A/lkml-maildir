tail of linux/include/asm-i386/xor.h:
| /* We force the use of the SSE xor block because it can write around L2.
|    We may also be able to load into the L1 only depending on how the cpu
|    deals with a load to a line that is being prefetched.  */
| #define XOR_SELECT_TEMPLATE(FASTEST) \
|         (cpu_has_xmm ? &xor_block_pIII_sse : FASTEST)
this code should probably be generalized to test for K7 feature flags, as well.
