that's what I did now. I've gnuplotted a few graphs from the collected
information which can be found here: 
http://www.foobar.de/memgraphs/.
Unfortunately the information from /proc/slabinfo hasn't given me deeper
insights yet, and I have not yet understood the code (but I must confess that
I haven't banged my head very hard against it, yet).
Does somebody have a clue for me on which part of the system is continuously
eating up the memory?
