Hi Linus,
these 7 patches sync the LinuxTV.org DVB driver CVS completely with
your latest 2.6.0-test7. 
Major fixes:
- many dvb frontend related fixes:
  - unify the alps_bsrv2 frontend driver with the new ves1x93 frontend driver
  - add private data pointer to frontend drivers
  - misc fixes in other frontend drivers
- update dvb-net handling
- fix vbi capture for DVB-C cards with analog module installed
I also back-feeded the kernel janitor patches from 2.6.0-test7 to our
local CVS tree, so I don't wipe them out by accident in the future.
Please apply.
Thanks
Michael.
