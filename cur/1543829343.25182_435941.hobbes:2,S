Not anymore, and who knows what might hang off a USB device in the
future.  We can't necessarily control our children like this, as some
other subsystem might want to use a usb_device as a parent, and there's
nothing wrong with that.

Hm, ok, yes, we should care about interfaces, but we need some way to
only walk them, not anything else that might be attached to us...
