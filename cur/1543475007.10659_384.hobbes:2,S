I'd prefer to see it remain in-kernel, mainly because it may need to be
privy to knowledge that is most easily obtained in-kernel (if the process
load address is variable, for example), and because it can safely be
considered an atomic and robust process if it is in the kernel. (Yes, I
know, putting it in the kernel doesn't make it bug free. But we can keep
the existing code that _does_ seem to be bug free.) 
The private-knowledge aspect isn't crucial: to set up a debugger, the same
information will need to be available through ptrace. But mostly I'd just
prefer to leave something alone if it isn't broken.
