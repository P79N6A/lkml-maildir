I'd say a better place to start would be Documentation/HOWTO in the
kernel source + all the resources that document points you at + a few
good books, like; "Linux Kernel Development", "Linux Kernel
Internals", "Linux Device drivers" etc (remember to get the latest
editions) + 
http://kernelnewbies.org
And of course, read the actual kernel source.
