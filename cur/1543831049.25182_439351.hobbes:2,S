In fact, according to Alan Cox answer, the first call is useless here at
all, i.e., tty_buffer_request_room() is for subsequent
tty_insert_flip_char() calls in a loop, not for
tty_insert_flip_string(). tty_insert_flip_string() calls
tty_buffer_request_room() itself, and does it in a loop in attempt to
find as much memory as possible.
tty_insert_flip_string() returns number of bytes it has actually
inserted, but I don't believe one can do much if it returns less than
has been requested as it means that we are out of kernel memory.
Overall, it seems it should be just:
+	if (tty && urb->actual_length) {
+		tty_insert_flip_string(tty, data, urb->actual_length);
