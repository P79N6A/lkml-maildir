Subject: [PATCH 2/4] posix timers: sigqueue_free: don't free sigqueue if it is queued
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/5/3/147

Currently sigqueue_free() removes sigqueue from list, but doesn't cancel the
pending signal. This is not consistent, the task should either receive the
"full" signal along with siginfo_t, or it shouldn't see the signal at all.
Change sigqueue_free() to clear SIGQUEUE_PREALLOC but leave sigqueue on list
if it is queued.
Note: I am not sure we shouldn't do the opposite, free sigqueue + cancel the
pending signal, but this needs some ugly changes. Perhaps we should reconsider
this change later. See also
