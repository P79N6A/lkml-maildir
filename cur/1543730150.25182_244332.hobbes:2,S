But what about the following (the first 3 points are already
familiar):
1. require read permission to do read()
2. require write premission to do write()
3. require CAP_SYS_RAWIO to do SG_IO
4. insert an initially blank (i.e. "drop everything") userspace
   controllable filter which allows the administrator to specify
   allowed SG_IO commands to the kernel at any time
That way there is no security problem, CD burning as root or generally
with CAP_SYS_RAWIO is always possible *and* admins are able to submit a
list of allowed commands to the kernel, so that CD burning as user is
possible again. This list might be specific to the CD writer hardware,
as we learned that some drives require vendor specific commands.
Prewritten filter lists for specific hardware can be published on
internet or even be submitted by cdrecord or other burning software,
i.e. with a switch "--install-filter" as root.
The filters should be separate for each SCSI device, so that you won't
enable dangerous commands on harddisk partitions when you just wanted
to enable CD burning.
If nobody else volunteers, I'll see if I can prepare a patch. I guess
sysfs is the right place for the userspace interface to the filters?

Julien
