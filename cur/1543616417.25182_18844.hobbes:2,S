Until you define the scope of the variables, you can't make that
assertion.  If the code is:
int b;
volatile const a=5;
void stuff()
{
  b = a - a;
}
I can see how a can change in the midst of the execution since
some other code has access to a since its global scope.
If the code is:
int b;
void stuff()
{
  volatile const a=5;
  b = a - a;
}
Then the code can be optimized to 'b = 0;' since nowhere in the scope
of 'a' does anyone take its address(which would allow it to be changed).
Of course if 'a' is external then another function can access its
address.

I don't think that anyone is arguing about that case *if so stated*.
What they are arguing about is the following code(and literally!):
void foo()
{
  int a=3;
  {
    volatile int b=10;
    a += b;
  }
  bar(a);
}
can *by inspection* be modified into:
void foo()
{
  bar(13);
}
Since:
1) a and b's scope are limited to the function, so they will reside on
   the stack.
2) No one takes the address of b, so there is no way for any external
   hardware/thread to modify b.
For the above code, I see no reason for not optimizing out 'b'(and for
that case 'a').  If others want to argue about volatile variables,
generate a *realistic* testcase where the possibility for modification
can be inferred, and then pitch your case.
