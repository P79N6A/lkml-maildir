Hi everyone,
I've just built a 2.6.7 kernel for a diskless machine and noticed
that simple stuff like init=/bin/sash stopped working. The output
to the console stops after "Freeing unused kernel memory". It only
works when using a full-blown init process. 
I compiled and statically linked a small program doing nothing but 
'printf("Hello.\n");', which shows output on my laptop using 2.6.2 when 
passed as init=/test, but not on the other machine with 2.6.7.
Because there is no kernel panic like "init not found", I assume the 
program which I specified has indeed been run as init replacement.
Can anyone shed any light on this problem?
Please CC me in the answer, as I am not a member of the list.
TIA, Yours,
Florian
