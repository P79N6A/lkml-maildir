Is there a mktime() in the kernel?  Isn't it pure user-space?  Mktime
does appear to know all about leap seconds (assuming they're in zoneinfo.)

I went back to the start of the thread.  Chris posted a stack trace
showing "#15 0xffffffff8104ec16 in ntp_leap_second (timer=<value
optimized out>) at kernel/time/ntp.c:143".  That would be kernel code to
process leap seconds from NTP broadcasts, I think.  That code needs to
be removed.
