Hi!
I have problem using my scsi card. It is an Adaptec 2940 (SCSI2). When
ever I try to load it as a module or if I compile it in the kernel I get
the folowing error messages. The last 4 messages repeats for ever. The
problem is on 3 diffrent machines. Anyone who know what it can be and
how to fix it.
