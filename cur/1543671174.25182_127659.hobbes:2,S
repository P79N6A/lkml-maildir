How about an "ugly patches" repository? Some central place for patches
which solve problems but are not esthetically pleasing. There would be
multiple benefits; those who want a fix and don't care if it will go
forward can get their system working, the ugly patch will remain as a flag
that the problem needs to be properly fixed, and the content of the patch
may help someone else understand and beautify the solution or come up with
a whole new solution based on better understanding.
