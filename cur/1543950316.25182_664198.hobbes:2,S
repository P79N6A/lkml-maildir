Subject: [PATCH 0/10] ocfs2: Userspace cluster stack support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

These patches allow ocfs2 to use the distributed lock manager in fs/dlm
in conjunction with a userspace cluster stack.
This series builds on the stack-glue series sent previously.  It
provides a plug-in for userspace cluster stacks and fs/dlm.  Userspace
is responsible for communicating with the cluster stack and feeding
events through the ocfs2_control misc device.  ocfs2 is otherwise
agnostic, using the DLM for all of its interaction.
Using the new ocfs2_stack_user plug-in requires a development version of
the ocfs2 tools.  This version knows how to load the plug-in and
provides a daemon to interact with the cman cluster stack.
The second to last patch enables the plug-in in Kbuild.  The last patch
adds Kconfig options to select which ocfs2 cluster plug-ins get built.
The kernel code is also available on the 'stack-user' branch of my git
repository.

The tools code is also available via git, in the 'stack-user' branch
as well.
