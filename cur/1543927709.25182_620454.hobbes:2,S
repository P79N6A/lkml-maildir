This fixes only symptom, not illness.
This check represent what code think about filesystem layout.
On what actually kind of UFS system did you test this patch?
When I sometime ago fixed similar issue for openstep ufs,
actully this was darwin's ufs which has the same layout,
I just set s_dirblksize to right value, may be for 
UFS_MOUNT_UFSTYPE_NEXTSTEP, UFS_MOUNT_UFSTYPE_NEXTSTEP_CD you need
do the same, see TODO items in fs/ufs/super.c.
