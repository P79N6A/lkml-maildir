Ok fair point. Here's an updated patch.

It is because 64bit doesn't have dyntick yet and doesn't try to use the lapic
timer only by default. It has a "apicmaintimer" option, but that is never set
automatically. When dyntick is ported over it will be needed there too.

Disable local APIC timer use on AMD systems with C1E
AMD dual core laptops with C1E do not run the APIC timer correctly
when they go idle. Previously the code assumed this only happened
on C2 or deeper.  But not all of these systems report support C2.
Use a AMD supplied snippet to detect C1E being enabled and then disable
local apic timer use.
This supercedes an earlier workaround using DMI detection of specific systems.
