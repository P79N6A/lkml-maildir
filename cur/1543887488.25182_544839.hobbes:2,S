Returning NULL would have the same effect..
But the problem is that we won't get 100% coverage of all codepaths
for ages, so any oopses we added won't get found.
otoh, any code which does dereference that pointer is buggy anwyay.
The problem here is that code which does
	kmalloc(some-expression-which-returns-0)
will go and assume that the kmalloc(0) got an ENOMEM and it'll take the
error path.
Oh well, let's persist with things as they now are.
Perhaps putting a size=0 detector into slab also would speed this
process up.
