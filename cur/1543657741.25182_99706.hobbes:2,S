Sounds broken to me.

Bill,
Looks like we simply jetisioned the concept of a PPL (Physical Pages List) 
and went with a zone allocator instead.  I'm sure there was a good reason for
it historically.  Rolling a separate zone is exactly what I was thinking 
when I reviewed the code intially.  Question, which files will be affected so when I put this one in, I don't end up breaking the VM and userspace balancing 
logic.  i.e.  Could you point me to Jens' ZONE_DMA32 code as well.
Thanks
Jeff
