Well, the above _is_ the same as "openat()", really. It's just using a
filesystem starting point to emulate a new system call. Same thing
conceptually. You could do pretty much any system call as a filesystem
action if you wanted to ;)
I don't disagree with doing so - as a way to expose the new system call to
scripts. But I don't think you're being entirely intellectually honest if
you think this suddendly makes it be "one namespace". It's still a
secondary namespace rooted in an entry in the normal ones - exactly like
"openat()". 
For a non-script, a native "openat()" interface would be more efficient
and less confusing, and conceptually no different from yours.  No reason
we couldn't have both, since they are 100% equivalent and would share the
same code anyway...
