How about a static signature followed by a timestamp? That way, maybe we could 
have a resume menu like this:
/dev/hda3  (kernel 2.7.88, suspended on 01-04-2004 20:00:00)
/dev/hda4  (kernel 2.8.99, suspended on 31-05-2005 20:00:00) ***
Resume in 5..4..3..2..1..
with a 5 second countdown before it chooses the most recent? Or in Pavel's 
examples:
Erk! Nowhere to resume from! 
:-)
