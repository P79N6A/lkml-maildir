If you only support recent kernels and glibc, true.
Debian is about to release a distribution with the 2.2 kernel.

Your "long long time" is very different, because you
always (?) run the very latest kernel.

Yeah, NOW it should work fine. App code sees:
old glibc and old kernel  -->  guess
old glibc and new kernel  -->  guess
new glibc and old kernel  -->  guess
new glibc and new kernel  -->  useful data
(the guess is correct for unmodified x86)
Two problems with that:
1. must handle the "guess" case
2. can't tell a guess from useful data!
So I can't use the useful data for a few more years.
I can cut that time down to maybe 2 years if I write
code to dig up the ELF notes myself, assuming that
were introduced with the 2.4 kernel.
