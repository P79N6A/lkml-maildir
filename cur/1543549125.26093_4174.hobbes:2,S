No it doesn't, and how can it?  There are lots of partitioning formats out
there, so making "mkswap" read the PC BIOS partition sector to verify that
it was a Linux swap partition would be brain dead, especially as you'd have
to bloat mkswap with lots of extra code to go around reading all these
different partition table formats.
Note that floppy disks don't have partitions, and therefore if you create
a partition on a floppy disk, Linux will ignore it.
