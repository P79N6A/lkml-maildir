I don't know that this is a good idea. I know this isn't likely to be
a popular statement, but I think that there should be at least some
minor justification to making a symbol GPL-only (it won't take much).
This seems like exactly the sort of thing that should be a generic
service available to all filesystem implementors whether it's GPL or
not. The usual justification for GPL-only is that it's something
random modules shouldn't be touching anyway, but it's something that
some part of the tree which could be a module needs.
