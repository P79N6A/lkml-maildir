Subject: [PATCH] sysfs: make lockdep ignore s_active
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/12/41

s_active is released by the thread doing the final sysfs_put() which
can be different from the thread which did sysfs_deactivate().  Make
lockdep think that s_active is unlocked immediately after it's write
locked.

Greg, this patch fixes lockdep error reported by Cornelia.  Please add
this to the patch series.  Andrew, this is the same one you took
earlier only with comments added.
Thanks.
