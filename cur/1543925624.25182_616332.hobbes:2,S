Bad things :-)
There needs to be a hierarchy of dma-ops, e.g., nommu/swiotlb, then a
hardware iommu, then pvdma. Not sure where IB fits in here. The
calling order would be the reverse of the initialization order, so
pvdma->hardare->nommu/swiotlb.

If it gets called first it can ensure that it runs either first or
last, or both, since it controls when to run the other hooks, before
or after it does what it needs to do.

Good point, this will require all dma ops implementation to provide
stubs that just return prev_ops->op if it's set.

Yeah, I'm not too enthusiastic about it, but we do need such a generic
mechanism or we will each end up implementing our own versions of
it...
