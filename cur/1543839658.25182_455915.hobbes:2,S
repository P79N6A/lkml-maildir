Well, actually I'd be glad to help. In fact, with this particular 2.4
patch at hand, fixing 2.6 seems incredbly straight-forward (or am I
getting ahead of myself?)
However, I wasn't able to reproduce the bug in my system just by
running losetup under strace. Maybe 2.6.15-1.2054_FC5 has it patched?
If if no one can help me out with this I'll boot into a stock kernel
later and try to trigger the bug again.
Cheers,
