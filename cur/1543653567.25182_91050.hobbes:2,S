I agree. If we can get as far with this for situations in which
mcore with bootimg worked (but then we never did try that on 
2.5 and am not sure if it was using the current aic7xx driver) that 
would be a lot - handling of more difficult cases can 
happen bit by bit after that. Whatever can be covered is useful even 
if it doesn't address all kinds of troublesome situations.

Yes there is, thanks :)
