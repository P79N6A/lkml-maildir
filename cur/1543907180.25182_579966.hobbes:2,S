I always cringe when I hear that. It's really more than node/sparsemem
use too many bits. If we get rid of 32bit NUMA that problem would be
gone for the node at least because it could be moved into the mostly
unused upper 32bit part on 64bit architectures.
The alternative would be to investigate again what it does to the
kernel to just use different lookup methods for this.
