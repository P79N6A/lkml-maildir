the delay before my answer was bigger...

after reading this at net/Kconfig:
<--  snip  -->
...
#   IPv6 as module will cause a CRASH if you try to unload it
config IPV6
        tristate "The IPv6 protocol (EXPERIMENTAL)"
...
<--  snip  -->
I'm wondering whether it might be an idea to disallow the modular 
building of IPv6 support?

It's currently discouraged but not completelyt impossible to select...
