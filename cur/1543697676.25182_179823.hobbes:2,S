Hi,
To begin with, thanks a lot for the concern you all have shown to address my 
problem.
This morning I have put in test9-bk25 image to see if the problem disappears. 
The result should be out in the next few hours. I hope it is OK if I send you 
the slabinfo in case the problem persists. 
I plan to test in stages.
i) Just bridging, no iptables
ii) With iptables.
I have very limited set of iptables rules. In fact it is as simple as blocking
icmp. There are no errors reported by ethernet devices.
Anand
PS : The latest test10 stops at the booting stage while initialising my aic7xxx
     scsi. So, I had to use bk25.
