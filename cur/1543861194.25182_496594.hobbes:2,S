Linus,
Please pull the i2c subsystem updates for Linux 2.6.20 from:
git://jdelvare.pck.nerim.net/jdelvare-2.6 i2c-for-linus
(This requests replaces the one from yesterday, as I received two urgent
fixes since then.)
These are late fixes that I want to have in 2.6.20, fixing compilation
breakage of the new i2c-pnx bus driver, a random oops in i2c-mv64xxx,
a bug in the m41t00 clock driver, and helping compatibility with
regards to planned i2c-core cleanups.
