If it has 'template' or 'operator' in it, make sure some sane people 
look at it.
IIRC, when the gcc people discussed this, they raised the possibility of 
adding compiler switches to allow subsetting the language. But there's 
nothing real out there that I know of.
BTW, C++ could take over some of sparse's function:
int foo(user_ptr<struct fugly_ioctl_arg> arg)
{
    return bar(arg->field); // won't compile
    struct fugly_ioctl_arg s;
    if (arg->copy_from_user(&s))
        return -EFAULT;
    return bar(&s); // yes!
}

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
