applied #9, #15 and #17
some comments for #11-12, #14 and #18-21 in separate mails
#10 and #16 are fine but because they depend on unmerged patches
I'm unable to apply them currently
Overall: good job!  300 LOC removed from the driver, code size savings
and a lot of preparations for the future ATAPI handling unification. :)
Thanks,
Bart
PS1 Please rebase the patches still needing polishing on top of updated
IDE quilt tree, recast them and respin the patch series (no need to post
already merged patches).
PS2 what happend to "fix DMA error reporting" patch? (#13 is missing, hmm?)
