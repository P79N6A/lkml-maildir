No problem here.

The idea of the patch looks good but there is a small problem.
I have an open/close fix queued with Alan for post-2.2.18,
which changes the enumeration scheme for ymfcpi to make it
more friendly to other sound cards (Bug from Abhijit Menon-Sen).
This is a conflict because you use instance number to find
what card goes in first. In fact I plan to send the same
thing to Linus for 2.4 (if he have not fixed that already).
Would you please to hold on to your patch for couple of weeks
and then resync and redo it? Alternatively, I'll keep your
patch and will reapply it in the way I see sane, but you will
have to retest it before I issue it.

Are you sure it's correct? I am almost certain that no YMFxxx
has on-chip AC97. I'd like to see a document that allows you
the change quoted above.
