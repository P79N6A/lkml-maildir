I've thought about these before ... but never got around to doing
anything about them.  I agree they should have a separate namespace.
However, I would vote the for namespace CONFIG__* rather than
CONFIG_*_DERIVED.  As Jeff noted, _DERIVED is quite a mouthful to type,
and CONFIG__* seems all-around less intrusive.
