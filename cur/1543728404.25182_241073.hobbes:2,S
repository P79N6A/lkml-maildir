Sorry, I'm not very good at this list / person CC stuff.  I sent a reply 
to Valdis.Kletnieks@vt.edu, but forgot to CC to list.  Contents as follows:
I'm not sure this is necessary.  Can't you just do:
# dump -0 -B 700000 -u -z3 /home -f -| cdrecord /dev/hdb -
dump and cdrecord allow you to use "-" as a filename to indicate that 
output shoud be written to stdout and input should be read from stdin 
respectively.
