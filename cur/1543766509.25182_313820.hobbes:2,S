Don't have an easy way to test that; I'd have to take it back to the 
person with a dual-boot box, as I'm pretty sure their update utility is 
a windoze bianry...
But, since problems are also happening with my cd-rw drive (even with 
the dvd-rw out of the system), which I know worked before, I don't think 
it's a drive problem.

Originally it shared a cable with my cd-rw drive, but I've tried it both 
on its own cable and sharing with one of my hard drives, on both the 
ata/66 controller and the ata/100 raid controller, with no changes at all.

80 conductor cables for all tests.  I might be able to dig up a 40 
conductor one for testing, but I don't think that'll help...

Someone suggested I try a binary search of kernel versions to figure out 
exactly when the cd-rw drive was broken (which worked before, unlike the 
dvd, which I have no idea if it ever worked), in an effort to figure out 
what caused it to break...  going to try this, but haven't had the 
time...  a long project.  :)
Thanks again,
