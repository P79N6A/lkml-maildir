In the more sensible "Standard Mode", they have their own IRQs.

No.  Patches like
  
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=117219531503973&w=2
should be merged (I hope they're in the 2.6.22 queue!), making
HPET run in "Standard Mode" so that HPET can stop sticking its
fingers in code where they don't belong.

It's already got suspend/resume support, and in the 2.6.22 queue
are RTC framework updates which will let the RTC framework replace
a lot more platform-specific RTC support.  (Platform changes can come
later, where they're needed.  ARM for example doesn't need any.)
Once HPET stops using "Legacy Replacement Mode" you won't need to
touch anything in the RTC stack (except maybe the legacy char/rtc.c
driver, removing HPET stuff).
The open issue with suspend/resume support in rtc-cmos relates to
how ACPI wakeup alarms should trigger.  I've not made time to test
those patches.
