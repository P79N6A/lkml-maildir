Problem still exists and persists. Not long time ago man from Yahoo
described well case when change from 2.2.19 to 2.4.x caused performance
problems. On 2.2.19 everything ran fine. They have MySQL running+did
backups from disk. After upgrade to 2.4.x MySQL performance felt down on
backup time. They investigated stuff and found that MySQL daemon gets
swapped out in the middle of usage to make room for buffers. In summary:
this made both sql and backup double slow. Even increasing memory from
1G->2G didn't helped. Finally they disabled swap at all and problem
lost.
If you do not want to change it back as it was in 2.2.x then would be
good if this is tunable somehow.
