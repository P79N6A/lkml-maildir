The NetWinder does the same thing... It has a red and a green LED on the
front which are software addressable. If you enable the CPU load LED
function, we light the red LED whenever we are _not_ running the idle
task. So when the machine is idle the light goes out, and when it's
working the light comes on. It can be pretty useful, as well as pretty.
