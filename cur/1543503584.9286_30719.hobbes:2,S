I've already replied a lot in private about this, but am crossposting
the list in the hope of getting thie to die off.  Anyone wanting a
persistent perl interpreter should read man perlembed, and
particularly the section entitled "Maintaining a persistent
intrpreter".  Its very easy, and all the code is in the manpage.
Apologies for wasting list bandwidth.
