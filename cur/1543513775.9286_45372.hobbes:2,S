0.5 (or is that 1.5.x?) is still fairly broken in certain circumstances - my 
work in progress patch, which got merged, is still very much in progress. 
Hopefully it'll be sorted out fairly shortly, though, and it should be a lot 
more reliable than 1.4.7. So if 1.4.7 goes into 2.2.14, it'd be nice to drop 
1.5.x into 2.2.15 later.
