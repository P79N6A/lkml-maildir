Hi Andrew,
> I'm inclined to simply revert that change.
In case the mentioned lines do cause problems, please do not hesitate
to remove them. As the comments indicate, the patch was completely
untested as I haven't had the cards available. However, please ensure
that the parallel port remains available for the 9835/9735 in case
they are removed from the parport module. Their references should be
removed *only* from parport_pc, not from the PCI name database.
So long,
	Thomas
