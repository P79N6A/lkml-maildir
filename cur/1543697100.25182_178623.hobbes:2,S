Use jiffies as other modules use it:
        tim = jiffies + TIMEOUT_IN_HZ;
        while(time_before(jiffies, tim))
        {
            if(what_im_waiting_for())
                break;
            current->policy |= SCHED_YIELD;
            schedule();
        }
//
// Note that somebody could have taken the CPU for many seconds
// causing a 'timeout', therefore, you need to add one more check
// after loop-termination:
//
            if(what_im_waiting_for())
                good();
            else
                timed_out();
Overflow is handled up to one complete wrap of jiffies + TIMEOUT. It's
only the second wrap that will fail and if you are waiting several
months for something to happen in your code, the code is broken.

If you need a list of timers, you grab the current jiffies plus
the current test value. After that, you use the time_before() macro
to test them.

You don't. Correct code will not require it. Correct code uses
jiffies as a relative value, not an absolute one. If you need
an absolute time value, you need to use sys_gettimeofday(), but
you should never use this for a time-out, only some time-stamp
because not all bits are exercised.

See above for code that uses jiffies.
