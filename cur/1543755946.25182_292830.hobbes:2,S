In case your EHCI disconnects devices under load, ub won't help.
You probably heard my claims that ub helps against certain memory
pressure related lockups and against problems in the SCSI stack,
which my even be true. Jury is still out on those and your case
seems different anyway. Please work with David Brownell on the EHCI
issues. I applied a few patches of his to the 2.4 which made a difference
in similar circumstances.
Good luck,
