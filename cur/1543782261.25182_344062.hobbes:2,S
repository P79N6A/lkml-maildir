Wouldn't it be better to pass out the highest precision available here
& then do the conversion in userspace instead?  I guess one might want
that little bit more for a RAM disk or something ... actually, talking
to one of the SGI people here with alot of experience on IRIX with a
similar facility, the msec resolution there is apparently sometimes an
issue already with fast storage.
cheers.
