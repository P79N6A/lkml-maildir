why does it fail? note that with the lower_zone_reserve_ratio algorithm I
added to 2.4 all dma zone will be reserved for __GFP_DMA allocations so
you should have troubles only with 2.6, 2.4 should work fine.
So with latest 2.4 it has to fail only if you already allocated 16M with
pci_alloc_consistent which sounds unlikely.
the fact 2.6 lacks the lower_zone_reserve_ratio algorithm is a different
issue, but I'm confortable there's no other possible algorithm to solve
this memory balancing problem completely so there's no way around a
forward port.
well 2.6 has a tiny hack like some older 2.4 that attempts to do what
lower_zone_reserve_ratio does, but it's not nearly enough, there's no
per-zone-point-of-view watermark in 2.6 etc.. 2.6 actually has a more
hardcoded hack for highmem, but the lower_zone_reserve_ratio has
absolutely nothing to do with highmem vs lowmem. it's by pure
coincidence that it avoids highmem machine to lockup without swap, but
the very same problem happens on x86-64 with lowmem vs dma.
