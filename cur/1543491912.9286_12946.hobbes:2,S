Hello !
recently i've upgraded to glibc-2.1 and my NFS daemons still in down...
when i try to start knfsd or nfs-server (doesn't matter), of course, both
are compiled with new glibc includes, it says:
Starting NFS services: rpc.statd get_myaddress: ioctl: No such device
rpc.rquotad get_myaddress: ioctl: No such device
rpc.mountd get_myaddress: ioctl: No such device
rpc.nfsd nfssvc: Permission denied
can anybody explain me, what i'm doing wrong? 
kernel 2.2.5, egcs 1.1.2, glibc-2.1, other from RH5.2
please, reply off the list
Grisha
