Hi Martin,
I just found out that my earlier statement "2.2.x is okay" should be
changed to "win98 is okay" so there are definitely problems with sharing
PCI irqs between eepro100/3c59x/(rtl)8139(too) in both 2.2.x and 2.4.x. I
utterly don't care about 2.2.x but I am in the mood to find out what's
wrong with 2.4.x.
If you have already fixed it all and I would be rediscovering the wheel,
please let me know. Otherwise, I will (very very slowly!) get to the
bottom of all this...
This may be driver-related or may be generally PCI-resource-related - I
don't know yet.
Regards,
Tigran
