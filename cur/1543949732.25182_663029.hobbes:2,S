Hi Jike,
   I'm surprised.. stunned even, to hear you say this.  stop_machine stops the 
machine: every CPU is frozen with interrupts disabled.  I am having trouble 
thinking of a better name.
  "schedule_a_thread_on_every_cpu_and_then_disable_interrupts" is a little 
long, and describes the implementation not the effect.
  "run_and_make_sure_no_cpus_have_preempt_disabled" also fails the "will Linus 
flame me?" test, I think.
  "freeze_machine" has connotations of the freezer, which is completely 
different from this.  "do_machine" is shorter, but sounds vaguely naughty.

Perhaps you were angling for "jike_machine"?  It's kind of catchy, but I don't 
think that patch will be accepted even if you pushed it as a git tree.
Cheers,
Rusty.
