It can't deadlock when only readers are involved, but lockdep will not
be able to distinguish between the cases where only read locks are
involved and a mix of readers and writers is involved.
Hence disallow both.
But hitting this requiers you do a series of rather unfortunate things:
 1) use recursive locking
 2) don't have strict lock order
 3) make it work by using read locks only
Seriously, any code that triggers this might want to have its locking
re-throught.
