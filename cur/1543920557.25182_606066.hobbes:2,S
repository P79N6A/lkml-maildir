Subject: [PATCH] fix adbhid mismerge
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

	Something really odd has happened: the last couple of changesets
have
-       int up_flag;
+       int keycode, up_flag;
and
-       int up_flag;
+       int up_flag, key;
in another, both in adb_input_keycode().  Even with -m passed to
git-whatchanged there's no sign of anything in that area.
Aside of trivial conflict resolution (see below), what's the right
way to trace the things like that?  Linus?
