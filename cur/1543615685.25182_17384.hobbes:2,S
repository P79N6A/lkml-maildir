For 64-bit machines an entirely different multiplier should be used,
one with p/2^64 approximately phi. And I'd rather see something like:
	hash   = (unsigned long)pages;
	hash  *= GOLDEN_RATIO_PRIME;
	hash >>= zone->wait_table_shift;
with no masking, since the above shift should be initialized so as
to annihilate all the high-order bits above where the table's page
size should be. On the other hand, shifting all the way may not be
truly optimal, and so it may be better to mask with a smaller shift.
2 or 3 shift/adds is really not possible, the population counts of the
primes in those ranges tends to be high, much to my chagrin. I actually
tried unrolling it by hand a few times, and it was slower than
multiplication on i386 (and uncomfortably lengthy). So Fibonacci
hashing may well not be the best strategy for architectures without
hardware integer multiplies.
I believe to address architectures where multiplication is prohibitively
expensive I should do some reading to determine a set of theoretically
sound candidates for non-multiplicative hash functions and benchmark them.
Knuth has some general rules about design but I would rather merely test
some already verified by someone else and use the one that benches best
than duplicate the various historical efforts to find good hash functions.
Cheers,
Bill
