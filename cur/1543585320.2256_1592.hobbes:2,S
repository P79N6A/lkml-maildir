If it is usefull for you, I'm running a SuperMicro P6DGU (400GX):
00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation 440GX - 82443GX Host bridge
00:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 440GX - 82443GX AGP bridge
00:07.3 Bridge: Intel Corporation 82371AB PIIX4 ACPI (rev 02)
00:0e.0 SCSI storage controller: Adaptec AHA-2940U2/W / 7890 (rev 01)
with 2xPII@400, 256Mb RAM. Bios version 3.1.
With 2.4.2-ac20+aic6.1.7. Just took away the scsi/aic7xxx from ac20 and
put instead the Gibbs version.
No problem.
