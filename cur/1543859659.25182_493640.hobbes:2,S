More likely a stray alpha particle from a radioactive decay in the actual chip
casing - I saw some research a while back that said that the average commodity
system should *expect* to see 1 or 2 alpha-induced single-bit errors per year,
and the chance that *you* saw the event was directly related to whether the
memory had ECC, and how much of the other circuitry had ECC on it....
