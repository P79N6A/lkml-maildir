The reality until 2.2.7 is that everyone wakes up, need_resched of the
current task is set to 1 so the rescheduled CPU will issue a schedule()
very shortly, but nobody of the wakenup tasks gets rescheduled and
schedule() become a nono. This is the main wastage of resources. I think
it's just fixed in pre-2.2.8-4 though ;).
