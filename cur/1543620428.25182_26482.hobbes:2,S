The address member of struct scatterlist appears to have been changed to 
dma_address.
A simple s/\.address/\.dma_address/ should fix this compile error.
ide-dma.c: In function `ide_raw_build_sglist':
ide-dma.c:269: structure has no member named `address'
ide-dma.c:276: structure has no member named `address'
