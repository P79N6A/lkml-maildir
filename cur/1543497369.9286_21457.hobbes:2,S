Subject: PROBLEM: fcntl(F_GETLK) on NFS-mounted file makes machine unusable

Hello,
if you do a fcntl() with F_GETLK on a NFS-mounted file/directory this will
make the system unusable printing
=====
RPC: doubly enqueued task!
RPC: failed to add task to queue: error: -11!
lockd: couldn't bind to server 136.199.14.109 - retrying.
=====
on the console (running `klogd -c 8 -d -s' and inserted an
`udelay(500000)' in printk ()).
The system is not responding anymore (running root shell with nice -18 on
tty1, but doesn't respond to any command within more than 10 minutes).
* Kernel Versions:	2.2.2, 2.2.6 and 2.2.9
* C Library:		glibc 2.0.7
* System:		SuSE 6.1 (same with SuSE 6.0 and Debian 2.x)
Any normal user of the system can produce this bug by using something like
this:
====
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int
main (int argc, char *argv [])
{
  int fd, ret;
  struct flock flk;
  fd = open ("/home/baulig/fcntl-killer.c", O_RDONLY);
  if (!fd) {
    perror ("open (/home/baulig/fcntl-killer.c)");
    exit (1);
  }
  memset (&flk, 0, sizeof (flk));
  ret = fcntl (fd, F_GETLK, &flk);
  if (ret == -1) {
    perror ("fcntl");
    exit (1);
  }
}
====
This will make the system unusable as soon as it executes the fcntl ()
system call. The machine is still responding to ping () but I have not
managed to make it do anything productive after that (for instance a short
C program printing the current time serveral times a second stops either).
As a side note, if you install netscape on a nfs mounted device, it will
use such a deadly fcntl () as soon as you choose `File / New Message'.
Please let me know if you need any more information.
