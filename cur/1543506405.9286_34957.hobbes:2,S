Seen that, worked around it... :) There are two ways to work around this
particular problem: Disable VJ compression on your ISDN link (-vj -vccomp
I believe it is on the ipppd commandline), or disable tcp_timestamps.
One way or the other the tcp_timestamps bite the VJ compression, if you
disable either one, you get your normal, fast link.
