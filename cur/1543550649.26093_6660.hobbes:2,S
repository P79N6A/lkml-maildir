	We Linux people ourselves are mainly UNIX users with fairly
	high changes of "just-sent-8-bit" being successfull, but in
	the corporate world there tends to be systems which take
	various degrees of upset at that.   Least of the wonders
	being increasing number of EBCDIC systems appearing in the net.
	(Most problems I encounter are with various LAN based email
	 environments which are hooked up to the Internet -- completely
	 incompatible systems.  Those EBCDIC systems have good
	 modern software, no much problems from them.)
	That you can flaunt the interoperability in your environment
	does not mean that everybody can do it.  I can't, for instance.
	The whole QP problem will go away when everybody moves to
	X.400 as their email environments.  (and get new problems.)
