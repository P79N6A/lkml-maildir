Done (see other message).. but does anyone know why the name size limit was introduced in 2.5? Saving memory? (all of 30-odd bytes per device, say 480 bytes in an average system? seems silly to reduce functionality that much to achieve such a tiny space saving; I mean it's understandable perhaps on an embedded system, but you wouldn't be compiling the database in then :)
