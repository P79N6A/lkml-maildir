Yes, very interesting (although if the problem appeared only after 72
hours of testing, it is hard to be sure that the bug is really fixed).

Yes, then the logic looks fine.  (The comment in count_open_files()
says "Find the last open fd", which is _almost_ what it does.)
There is also some unused code and slightly incorrect comment in
dup_fd():
	size = old_fdt->max_fdset;
... here "size" is not used ....
	/* if the old fdset gets grown now, we'll only copy up to "size" fds */
... here "size" is not used either ....
	size = (new_fdt->max_fds - open_files) * sizeof(struct file *);
The result of the first assignment to "size" is not used anywhere,
even if it is mentioned in the comment.  However, the intent to keep
the old size of fdset is noted again.

So we probably got a bogus "struct file" pointer...

 From what little I know about PowerPC, this looks like an atomic
increment of the memory word pointed to by r0, which contains
0xffffffff00000028 - definitely looks like a bogus address.  The
offset of file->f_count should be 0x28 on a 64-bit architecture, so
apparently we got f == 0xffffffff00000000 from *old_fds.  Something
scribbled over that memory?
