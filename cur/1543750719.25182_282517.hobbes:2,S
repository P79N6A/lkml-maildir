Well, just about any secondary bus (e.g. usb, iee1394, i2c) works that way,
but I guess all those examples are a little too complicated for your example.
the PPC OCP stuff might be a better example as it's an on-chip pseudo-bus,
otoh it's a top-level bus and not parented by PCI.

Hmm?  void __iomem must only ever be used as a pointer and passed to
readX/writeX.  Pointer arithmetics are allowed and it's treated equally
to char * for that (GCC extension)

void * is magic in C and can be assigned to any pointer and vice versa.
