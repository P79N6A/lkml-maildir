Definitely useful, no question.
But the problem is now that kernel devs are addicted to it,
many won't even consider resolving a problem any other way.
That's not "maintaining" (or supporting) one's code.
And when a "maintainer" is too busy to find/fix their own bugs,
that could be a sign that they've bitten off too big of a chunk
of the kernel, and it's time for them to distribute code maintainership.
Cheers
