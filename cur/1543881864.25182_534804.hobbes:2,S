correct, but remember that in the real world O(total_file_system_size) does not 
mean that it can't work well. it just means that larger filesystems will take 
longer to check.
they aren't out to eliminate the need for fsck, just to be able to divide the 
time it currently takes by a large value so that as the filesystems continue to 
get larger it is still reasonable to check them

in a pathalogical situation you are correct, it would take longer. however 
before declaring that this is completely unacceptable why don't you wait and see 
if the pathalogical situation is at all likely?
when you are doing ha with shared storage you tend to be doing things like 
databases, every database that I know about splits it's data files into many 
pieces of a fixed size. Postgres for example does 1M files. if you do a chunk 
size of 1G it's very unlikly that more then a couple files out of every thousand 
will end up with continuation nodes.
remember that the current thinking on chunk size is to make the chunks be ~1% of 
your filesystem, so on a 1TB filesystem your chunk size would be 10G (which, in 
the example above would mean just a couple files out of every ten thousand would 
have continuation nodes).
with the current filesystems it's _possible_ for a file to be spread out across 
the disk such that it's first block is at the beginning of the disk, the second 
at the end of the disk, the third back at the beginning, the fourth at the end, 
etc. but users don't worry about this when useing the filesystems becouse the 
odds of this happening under normal use are vanishingly small (and the 
filesystem designers work to make the odds this small). similarly the chunkfs 
designers are working to make the odds of every file having a continuation nodes 
vanishingly small as well.
