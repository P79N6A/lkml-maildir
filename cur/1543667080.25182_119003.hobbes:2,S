  Thanks for replies.
  Mea culpa. Partially ;-)
  1. first problem - sockets. I will check shutdown() - but 
    I am doing shutdown(). This is listen() socket.
    Or I was caught with SO_LINGER again... I will check 
    this again.
  2. buggy driver from second party company has no wake_up 
    in release code. In turn I have copied part of /generic/
    code from this driver - so I had same troubles.
    I have just checked the (reference for me) pipe/fifo 
    implementations - they do wake_up in release.
  Thanks for the help.
P.S.  Actually I have managed to press my management and they 
 agreed on shift to single-threaded design. So I hope this 
 will be not a problem any more at all.
