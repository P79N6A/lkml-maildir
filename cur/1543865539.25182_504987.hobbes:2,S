You don't understand the code you are editing :-)
We want to process the number of packets present when we
start the function, other threads can add more packets to
the queue meanwhile and we don't want to keep dequeueing
in that case or else we can theoretically run forever with
a fast enough producer.
Also, please post all networking patches to netdev@vger.kernel.org,
the majority of the networking developers do not read linux-kernel.
Thank you.
