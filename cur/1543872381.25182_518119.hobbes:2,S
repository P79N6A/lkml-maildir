I debugged a case exactly like this (with the TRACE_RESUME() thing) back 
last November on my laptop.
The problem is that radeonfb actually *tries* to re-initialize the 
graphics chips, but because it doesn't know all the details, it does it 
wrong, and hangs the whole chip.
I forget exactly where it happened, and it might well be different for 
you. But this is exactly what TRACE_RESUME can be used to pinpoint if you 
want to try to debug it.
