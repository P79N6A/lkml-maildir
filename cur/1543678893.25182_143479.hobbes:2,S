It's a stupid question, since:
  - We won't kill off all those companies, just the lame ducks among them
  - Said lame ducks spend more money on managers than software developers
    anyway
  - Mostly they are just copying (or outright plagiarizing) not innovating
  - There will still be plenty of software when the lame ducks are gone
  - We don't "copy" software, we "derive new software from existing works".
A better question to ask would be: could we possibly fit more logical 
fallacies into a single sentence?
Regards,
Daniel
