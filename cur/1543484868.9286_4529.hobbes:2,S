I seen, it's due a my bug in my inode patches. I'm afraid.

Perfect report.

I am happy to hear that my VM is working well for you ;)

Right you are, be careful, don't bother Linus with my bugs.
You can find the bug you reported just fixed if you apply:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/testing/pre-patch-2.2.2-2.gz
on the top of 2.2.1.
Then you have to apply my arca-diff:
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/linux/arca-tree/2.2.2-pre2_arca-1.gz
on the top of 2.2.2-pre2.
Let me know if you'll have problems. 2.2.2-pre2_arca-1 should be rock
solid according to me. 
Thanks for the report.
