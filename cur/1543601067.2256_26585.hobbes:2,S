Can you elaborate on that? IMO what PAM does is the only sensible thing
to do: abstraction of the authentication procedure. You cannot have
different authentication schemata (passwords (encrypted with Unix
crypt(), MD5, algorithm-of-the-month), smart-cards, biometrical
methods), multiple independently developed programs and stay sane
without such a thing as PAM in place. One can discuss _how_ PAM does
what it does, but _what_ it does only makes sense.

That won't happen. What you propose induces a single point of failure
where it isn't necessary. Personally I like that if something screws up
my nameserver configuration that I still can login -- this is one point
why I abhor anything remotely resembling to a registry, a centralized
configuration database (or directory if you wish). Think of what would
happen if some bits flipped in your directory and all of a sudden root
can't write to disk anymore (ok, I'm painting black here).

In that scale, any configuration files rolled out to my machines would
be generated from scratch, i.e. with templates or a similar technique.

You can even create "admin tools that dumb down the configuration" with
the current arcane method of plain ASCII configuration files. Not that
I'd like admins who need dumbed down configuration to administer my
machines. If you want working machines, you need skilled personnel to
operate them -- that's my opinion. If you have a network of NT machines,
you know a decent admin by his ability to script his tasks. Switching
from scripting on Windows to Unix/Linux shouldn't be hard, rather the
opposite.

In order for Linux to reach the desktop, there is a lot to be done, but
I suspect it more in the areas of user interfaces (interoperability
between KDE and GNOME for instance, decent help systems),
interoperability with MS Office, games. The admin tools that exist now
are mostly sufficient when it comes to end users.
