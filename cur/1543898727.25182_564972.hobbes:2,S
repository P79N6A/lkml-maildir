I've got a question from a network driver writer's perspective:  In
drivers which sit on top of a midlayer/ multi-protocol infrastructure,
should dev->dev.parent be the lowlevel's pci_dev.dev or the midlayer's
whatever_abstracted_dev.dev?
(Example:  eth1394 network driver sits on top of ieee1394 = FireWire
midlayer, this sits on top of ohci1394 = PCI driver for FireWire
controllers.)
I guess it should be the lowlevel's pci_dev.dev, unless the midlayer
cares to set
  set_dev_node(&midlayer_dev.dev, dev_to_node(midlayer_dev.dev.parent));
And either way, for full effect of NUMA awareness in the highlevel
network driver, the midlayer should be NUMA aware too...
