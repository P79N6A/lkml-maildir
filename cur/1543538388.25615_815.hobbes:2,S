Subject: 2.3.10 kernel upgrade - system map problem

Hello,
I have recently upgraded redhat linux 6.2 (kernel 2.2.14-5.0)
to kernel 2.3.10. I need this for drivers.
The new kernel works fine on my system but I am
getting a few errors with system map
in /var/log/messages
Inspecting /boot/System.map
Symbol table has incorrect version number.
Cannot find map file.
Loaded 6 symbols from 1 module
Presumably i need to make a new system map
because it's a different kernel... 
Can anyone give a hint how to sort this?
additional errors (if anyone knows how to sort these!)
sysctl: error: 'net.ipv4.ip_always_defrag' is an unknown key
sysctl: error: 'kernel.sysrq' is an unknown key
3, A final note, does anyone know a good kernel resource
which documents problems/weaknesses of different linux 2.3.*
devolopment kernels.
All help appreciatted
Kevin D.
