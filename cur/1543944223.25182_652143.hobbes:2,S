i'm glad that there are no other valid-looking (to me) objections left 
against kgdb-light -v10, other than "it would be nice to have more kgdb 
functionality" and "it would be nice to rewrite the parser", right?
:-)
(It seems we do have a fundamental disagreement about how kgdb should 
act: in my opinion it should never break a correct system, while in your 
opinion apparently it's OK to compromise on that to make debugging 
easier. (find below more detailed arguments about this.) If you do not 
change your position about that issue we'll have to agree to disagree 
about that point.)
So unless i forgot about something (please yell if so), it seems to me 
kgdb is now pretty ready for an upstream merge.
here are my replies to the most recent points you brought up [in order 
of how i perceive the topic's importance]:

i gave you very specific technological reasons for why we dont want to 
do spinning for now: we dont _ever_ want to break a correctly working 
system with kgdb.
A valid counter-argument is _not_ to argue "but it would be nice to have 
if the system is broken in X, Y and Z ways" (like you did), but to point 
it out why the behavior we chose is wrong on a correctly working system.
Yes, a buggy system might misbehave in various ways but my primary 
interest is in keeping correctly working systems correct.
And note that kgdb is not just a "debugger", it's a system inspection 
tool. An intelligent, human-controlled printk. A kernel internals 
learning tool. An extension to the kernel console concept. Yes, people 
frequently use it for debugging too, but the other uses are actually 
more important in the big picture than the debugging aspect.

but your contention is simply wrong. Most of our debugging 
infrastructure is non-modular for a good reason. Modularization 
increases complexity and that's exactly the wrong direction for 
debugging code. (especially for a first-level merge like this one)

it's already commented in -v10 at several places.

it's not reimplemented - kgdb_arch_pc() does not directly map to 
instruction_pointer().

that's already all taken out in -v10. (if you find any leftovers then 
please cite the code where it isnt - thanks!)

that's the approach we are taking: be as unintrusive as possible. This 
means that the notifier here is registered at the lowest priority. You 
might disagree with it but it's a completely sensible and consistent 
approach.
