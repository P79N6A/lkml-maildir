Ok - we're at an impasse here.
You know the code a whole lot better than me.
Is there anything you can think of that will allow us to block the DOS
without breaking every medium to heavily loaded postfix and apache site
out there.
Somthing that doesn't require the administrators of every single
machine in one or the other class to tune their configurations?
Brong ( we expect you to know how to tune epoll, we don't expect every 
        apache and postfix administrator to know to tune a brand new 
        setting that just appeared in the last point release - especially 
        since most of them probably have no idea how many epoll watches
        their software creates as a single user, and have never needed 
        to think about it before)
