My Dear Friend,
 
I hereby contact you personally concerning the
Situation in my bank. In order to transfer out
{us$34,000,000} Thirty Four Million us dollars, I have
the courage to look for a Reliable and honest person
who will be capable for This important business
believing that you will never Let me down either now
or in future.
I am Dr. Mammud Abdul  Ali, the Regional
computing auditor of (STANDARD BANK OF SOUTH AFRICA)
JOHANNESBURG BRANCH (SBSA). 
There is an account opened in this bank in 1985 and
since 1991 nobody has operated on this account again.
After going through some old files in the records I
discovered that if I do not remit this money out
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing according to
South Africa laws and act of 1993,the money will be
revert this country government treasury after 15 years
if there is no valid clai m.
I n! eed a foreign partner that will present as a
relative to this late man. I concluded to transfer
this money overseas for proper investment that will
benefit me. The owner of this account is Mr. Daniel
B.Jones, a foreigner, and a Miner at Kruger Gold Co. a
geologist by profession and he died since 1990. No
other person knows about this account or any thing
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary
and my investigation proved to me as well that this
company does not know anything about this account and
the amount involved is US$34,000,000 Thirty Four
million dollars.
I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this
money can not be approved to a local bank here, but
can only be approved to any foreign account because
the money is in US dollars and the former owner of the
account is Mr. Daniel B Jones, who is a foreigner too.
I know that this message will come to you as a
surpri! se as we don't know ourselves before,! we will
sign agreement, but be sure that it is real. I only
got your contact address from my secretary during a
normal routine search, I believe in God that you will
never let me down in this business, you are the only
person that I have contacted in this business, so
please reply urgently so that I will inform you the
next step to take urgently. Send also your private
telephone and fax number. 
I want us to meet face to face or sign a binding
agreement to bind us together so that you can receive
this money into a foreign account or any account of
your choice where the fund will be safe. I am
contacting you because of the need to involve a
foreigner as the beneficiary. I need your
full co-operation to make this work fine. Because the
management is ready to approve this payment to any
foreigner who has correct information of this account,
which I will give to you later immediately, if you are
able and capable t o handle such amount in strict
confidence and trust according to my instructions and
advice for our mutual benefit. I need a truthful
person in this business because I don't want to make
mistake and I need your strong assurance and trust. 
With my position now in the office I can transfer
this money to any foreigner's reliable account, which
you can provide with assurance that this money will be
intact pending my physical arrival in your country for
sharing. I will destroy all documents of transaction
immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to
any place. you can also come to discuss with me face
to face after which I will make this remittance in
your presence. I will use my position and influence to
effect legal approvals and onward transfer of this
money to your account with appropriate clearance forms
of the ministries and foreign exchange departments. At
the conclusion of this bussiness, you will be given
50%of the total amount! , 50% is for me and my family, I
look forward to your earliest reply through my email
address.
