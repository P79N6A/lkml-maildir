Yes. We _could_ do that, by just making a "we noticed the disk change" be
a hotplug event. However, I'm loath to do that, because some devices
literally don't even have an easily read disk change signal, so what they
do is
 - assume the disk _always_ changed on open
 - do a quick IO to verify it
and I'd be nervous about that kind of thing resulting in hotplug being 
called constantly if somebody rude just has an endless loop of 
"open()/close()".
