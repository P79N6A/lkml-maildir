Your points are noted and taken, and once AC and I bang out the details in
2.4-ac series they are easily brought forward.  I am staying off 2.5
until I can ramp back up the learning curve on the changing API's.
I really do not want to go in and change what Jens has port forwarded
until I have a complete grasp again.  There are no more major changes at
this point and only delta's as needed to constrain concerns.
The only change could be the addition of SATA II support as soon as I
receive the WG's documents.
Cheers,
