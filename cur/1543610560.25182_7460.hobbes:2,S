Well, actually I'm not the "must-use-hdparm -c1 -u1 -d1 -m16 -W1 -X66" kind
of guy... I just tested some options because my system was slow. I do not
run hdparm now, and everything works fine (with your ATA patch, and the
preempt patch). I'm moving the hard disks to the "on-board" controller
(PIIX) today, to see if that works better (without preempt+ata).
Also, I *would* be upgrading my linux system *if I had money*, but until
then, I happily run with my crappy BP6, crappy HD's and crappy HPT366
controller.

I'm sorry if the subject set you off.. what I should have written is
propably "ATA hard disk access slows down my system", but I was tired and
had previously been reading "comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.space-sim".
Also, I'm not meaning to sound important or anything with my sig. Maybe I
should change it? Hmm...
