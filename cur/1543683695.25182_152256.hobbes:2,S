On either 2.6, or 2.4, booting with ACPI enabled gets as far as
parsing the ACPI EC table - at which point it oops with bad pointer
and halts the system.  Sorry at this point I don't have the register
contents; it took a while to narrow it this far - and have the
screen in such a state that I can see any relevant information other
than the the trying to kill init message :)
