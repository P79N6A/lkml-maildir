I would call this a bug:
[root@innerfire /root]# ifconfig sit0 tunnel ::206.123.31.102
SIOCSIFDSTADDR: No buffer space available
[root@innerfire /root]# ifconfig -V
net-tools 1.57
ifconfig 1.40 (2000-05-21)
Dmesg confirms I've compiled in support:
IPv6 v0.8 for NET4.0
IPv6 over IPv4 tunneling driver
early initialization of device sit0 is deferred
