Warning: I'm only looking at the patch.
You are supposed to print an error message for a user, not to write in a
chat window to a 1337 script kiddie. OK, you just matched the current style,
and your patch is IMHO OK for a quick security fix, but:
- Security fixes should be CCed to the security mailing list, shouldn't they?
  (It might be security@ or stable@, I'll remember tomorrow, but then I'd
   forget to comment)
- Imagine you have three mounts containing a minix fs, how can you tell which
  one is the the defective one?
- The message says "minix_bmap", while the patch suggests it's in
  block_to_path. Therefore I asume "minix_bmap" to have only random
  informational value.
- Does block < 0 or block > $size make a difference?
- the printk lacks the loglevel.
- Asuming minix supports error handling, shouldn't it do something?
I'd suggest a message saying something like "minix: Bad block address on
device 08:15, needs fsck".
