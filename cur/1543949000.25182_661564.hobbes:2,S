Andrew "Use time_* macros" series i sent to LKML on 14 Feb [1] has this chunk also (and by the way this version not includes linux/jiffies.h for time_after macro). Some part of this series already gone into Linus's tree with different subsystems but others not received any review/ack or nack. Will you grab others for -mm or will i resend them?
