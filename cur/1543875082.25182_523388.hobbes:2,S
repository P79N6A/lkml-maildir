Instructions for bisecting:
<--  snip  -->
# install git and cogito on your computer
# clone Linus' tree:
cg-clone \ 
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
# start bisecting:
cd linux-2.6
git bisect start
git bisect bad v2.6.21-rc4
git bisect good v2.6.20
# start round
cp /path/to/.config .
make oldconfig
make
# install kernel, check whether it's good or bad, then:
git bisect [bad|good]
# start next round
After at about 12 reboots, you'll have found the guilty commit
("...  is first bad commit").
More information on git bisecting:
  man git-bisect

        of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
