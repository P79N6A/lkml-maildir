Yes, that's true.

Since the principle use of testing array for NULL or not was to find out 
if the task was on a run list it seems silly to have a flag to determine 
this.  All it does is provide an opportunity for the flag to not 
accurately reflect whether the task is really on a list or not.
It caused the number of files touched by the staircase patch to increase 
  by a factor of five which is another good reason to use the alternative.
