Have any fixes gone into any of these pre-patches which could affect
the mm subsystem? I've been getting `couldn't get a free page' errors
and all-CPU-time-eating kswapds on a tiny little 8Mb 486 doing a bunch
of networking tasks, at intervals of about three days. The only recourse
after this happens is the big red switch because fork()ing seems to
take forever (perhaps because it needs at least one 4K page and there
aren't any).
There are no messages logged other than `couldn't get a free page' :(
The relevant .config (well, the 2.0.35-equivalent version because I
had to revert to stop this problem) is:

The crash seems to be module-independent (i.e. it's happened with no
modules loaded at all).
Any ideas?
