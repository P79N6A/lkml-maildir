Subject: setting CONFIG_HZ=2000 screws up ntpd

Dear list,
I use attached patch to speed up HZ from 1000 to 2000. I use this hack
starting from kernel  2.6.7 and I have not experienced any particular
problems. Recently I've started to use NTP and  have noticed that ntp
client loose synchronization, if this patch is applied, i.e. it
connects, synchronizes, and then after a few polls,  jitter just jumps
to 5 digit number. I've rechecked the behavior on the kernel 2.6.11
and results are the same - applied patch just "skews up" ntpd, while
there are no any problems with vanilla kernels.
Is the patch incorrect in any way?

The patch ajusts kernel internal clock timer to 2000HZ instead of 1000HZ. This 
is required to decrease response time of some drivers (currently rocket.ko).
