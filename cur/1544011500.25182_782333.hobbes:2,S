Messages about something or other being "illegal" occur about 345 times in
the Linux kernel source code. Are we going to start patching those too?
We have "illegal norm", "illegal input", "illegal call", "illegal type",
"illegal bits", "illegal root port number", "illegal host number", "illegal
DMA data", "illegal dimensions" (who do you call about that one?), "illegal
phase", "illegal page number", "illegal seek", and on, and on, and on.
I suspect that if I submitted a patch to change all of those to "invalid",
I'd be considered a kook. (Well, more of a kook, anyway.)
