Local APIC and IO-APIC works on Linux many time ago, before hi-res
timer. 
The problem is that lapic are in computer but aren't programmed or isn't
suppose to work, this is not clear, why this lapics don't work.
what we know is that BIOS says that computer don't have lapic, so it it
a mistake try enable something that don't work , I think.
I had a Compaq Presario laptop with this problem, so I know this because
I pass throw it. you have one Laptop HP which could be a similar issue.
