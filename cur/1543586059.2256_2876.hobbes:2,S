It uses the same version number ( 1.15 ) as the "official" apm.c
( at linuxcare.com.au/apm ). I don't think that is a good idea.
Maybe 1.14b ?

To implement off-button you only need the APM_IOC_REJECT ioctl and apmd 3.0
and a slight change to the apm_proxy script.
It must be changed to execute "poweroff" and return a value of 1 ( so that
the apmd/kernel/apm-driver reject the event ) in case of "system suspend" event.
The only problem might be synchronization  ( "poweroff" might kill apmd
before is sends the REJECT call to kernel ).
