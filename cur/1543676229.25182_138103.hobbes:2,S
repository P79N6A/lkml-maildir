I can't find anywhere the BIOS is obliged to set it for you if a PnP OS
is installed, ditto in the presence of any form of hotplug the test is
wrong.
As far as I can see you can only warn if MWI is already set in the
control word, and (I'd have to check the spec) possibly if the
cache line size is non zero.
(simple hotplug thought experiment to prove the point
	Soft boot a thinkpad 600
	As the bios transfers to grub insert in docking station
explain how the bios sets the cache line size..)
