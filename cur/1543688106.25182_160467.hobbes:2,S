Because not every process that runs under your identity should have your
full set of rights.  You should be able to confine a given process based
on more than just the associated user identity, e.g. the role and
clearance in which the user is operating, the function and
trustworthiness of the program that the process is executing, etc. 
Otherwise, you have no protection against flawed or malicious programs
executed from any of your sessions.
