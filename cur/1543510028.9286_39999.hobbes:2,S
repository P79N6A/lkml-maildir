In fact for IMAP servers it's assumed that the
server itself will do the filtering and manage the
mail folders, as opposed to POP servers which just
serves unsorted mails to you. I use an IMAP
server which stores my mails in several folders
depending on the rules I specified, so Linux
kernel mails are stored in the appropriete
folder. So I think it's not an Outlook missing,
that's the server that have to filter and store
your emails.
