IMHO it would be inefficient.
There obviously are some non-RAM pages that should not be saved and there are
some that are not worthy of saving, although they are RAM (eg because they never
change), but this is very archtecture-dependent.  The arch code should mark them
as PageNosave for swsusp, and that's enough.
Greets,
Rafael
