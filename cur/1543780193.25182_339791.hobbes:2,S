I guess this is the key statement and I'm not really the one to judge
whether or not the kernel could "keep up with the changes" but if
they mean the kernel development process then surely they're
wrong?

Surely it can't be that big a task if they distribute a shell script with their
drivers that does it automagically?

They're obviously working against a copy of the kernel when they write their
drivers so I don't see how difficult it would be to submit incremental diff's
for inclusion or at least the diff's between each stable version.
But I digress.. I guess it comes down to whether anybody is willing to put
in the effort to incorporate the current version into the kernel. If
not then, like
Adrian says, it's probably best just to leave it for the time being and if later
on down the line they still haven't submitted an updated version then
incorporating one or removing the old one. I'd be more willing to do the
former if I had more than 0 experience of kernel development.
