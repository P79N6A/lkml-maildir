I understand the difference. It was more about Kirill grabbing numbers 
out of the air.  I actually think the containers and Xen complement each 
other very well.  As Xen is now based on 2.6.16 (as are both VServer and 
OVZ) it makes sense to run a few Xen domains that then in turn run 
containers in some scenarios.  As far as the last part, Xen doesn't 
share resources at all :)
Thank you,
