I'm running 2.2.12 with Debian 2.1 on several machines, and
(after heavy disk activity) keep getting the following messages:
Oct  8 10:31:50 gubesa kernel: hda: dma_intr: error=0x10 
     { SectorIdNotFound }, LBAsect=9139240, sector=689050 
Oct  8 10:31:50 gubesa kernel: hda: dma_intr: status=0x71
     { DriveReady DeviceFault SeekComplete Error } 
What's really bad, during e.g., kernel recompilation something 
strange happens and all running jobs loose their USER
(meaning eg, >whoami fails, "You don't exist, go away!", ...).
Only hard reboot helps.
On all machines, the disk is 13GB Fujitsu:
> cat /proc/ide/hda/geometry 
physical     25230/16/63
logical      1583/255/63
> cat /proc/ide/hda/model 
FUJITSU MPD3130AT
Is this hardware or kernel problem or something else?
