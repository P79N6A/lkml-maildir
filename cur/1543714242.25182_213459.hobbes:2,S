Regressions... from the context, I'm assuming you're not talking
regression errors here?  I'm assuming these are performance issues?  I
see a 3.5% drop in compiling speed between 2.4.24 and 2.6.5 on a dual
Athlon workstation.  I'll test this kernel happily if the scheduler
tweaks are intended to address this.
