Oops, lol didn't see your other issue. Well, personally I haven't had any luck 
with bootup logos. However Im pretty sure if you disable framebuffer console
CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE=n
then you'll get your screen back. I have trouble with the FB options, so i 
cant recommend a better fix other than to not use it ;)
