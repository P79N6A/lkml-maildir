As far as I remember I saw some places in the code which should be fixed 
before split 1/3 can be used. Split 0.5/3.5 can be not-working if you are 
using PAE-enabled kernel (in some places pgds are copied directly - i.e. 1GB 
granularity is used).
Anyway due to bug in glibc pthread lib some apps are not working properly with 
non-standart 3/1 split (i.e. java).
I'm working on 4GB/4GB split now (kernel space is separated from user space 
completely). If someone wants to have a look at it I will probably post it 
later.
