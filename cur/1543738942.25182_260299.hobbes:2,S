The changes to libselinux and procps and any scripts that directly
access /proc/pid/attr to deal with multi-entry values would be more
important; changing the kernel to prepend "selinux: " on getprocattr and
to strip it on setprocattr would indeed be trivial (but one wonders
whether we can be confident that userspace will never try to pass one of
these multi-entry values read from /proc/pid/attr to another interface
that expects a single context, e.g. selinuxfs or
setxattr("security.selinux")).
