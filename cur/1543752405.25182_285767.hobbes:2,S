I thought I made it clear that I didn't even know the name of library.
And I thought I understood from you that you had to do different
start-up per client depending on whether RT was available. Have I
misunderstood you?

That actually sounds like an independent API problem.

Assuming a more thread-aware API, they just ask for privileges again.
But with the non-thread-aware API, my first reaction would be the thread in
question clones, and the clone drops privileges.
