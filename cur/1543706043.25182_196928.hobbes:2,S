that could explain why I recently discovered that a 2.4.25-rc1 on a supermicro
MB with ICH5 was limiting hda and hdb to 30 MB/s at UDMA33 while an old 2.4.20
+ many patches including IDE gave me about 64 MB/s at UDMA100.
I can hack piix_ratemask() to test if the limit goes away.

well, why not in piix:piix_ratemask() around line 315 ?
