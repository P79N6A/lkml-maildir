Looks like my guess was right after all.  The amount of swap
IO is maybe 10% of the amount of filesystem IO in your vmstat
snippet above.

Two things could be happening here:
1) the kernel decides to cache the wrong things in the
   page cache
and/or
2) the IO scheduler is giving worse latencies now
If the problem is (1) it might get resolved by using the -rmap
or -aa kernels.  If the problem is (2) you'll want Andrew Morton's
read_latency patch (which I'll port to 2.4.20 real soon now).
