Somewhat off the original topic, but am I the only one who finds it weird
(and error-prone) that you have to add the same KConfig to a dozen or more
Kconfig files?
Shouldn't there be a KConfig libe, and all you need to do for the arch is
reference the CONFIG_FOO from the lib?  Would at least save all the
duplicate strings and definitions...
Kconfig.lib:
	config DEBUG_BUFFERS
		bool "Enable additional filesystem buffer_head checks"
		depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
		help
		  If you say Y here, additional checks are performed that
		  aid filesystem development.
arch/*/Kconfig
	libpath /Kconfig.lib
	...
	insert DEBUG_BUFFERS
	...
If the inserted symbol is not found in the Kconfig libpath, error out.
You can then break debug Kconfigs into a separate lib file, etc.  Maybe
that's too far, but you get the idea?
Sorry, just a nit that bothers me.
