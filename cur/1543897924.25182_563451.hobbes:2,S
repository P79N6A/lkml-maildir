    Hi all :)
    I have a new card reader (internal) but I've tested with my old one
too: the same happens. I have a do-it-yourself linux box, self compiled
kernel 2.6.19.5 (by now).
    When I insert a card in the reader, it is not detected, no udev
event is generated and I have to do things like "hdparm -z /dev/sda" to
"probe" the card. Moreover, I have to do the same when removing the card
or the /dev/sdaX nodes are not deleted.
    Is HAL the only way of making it work? Is there any CONFIG_ thing
I've forgotten in my kernel?
    I've tested with Ubuntu and it works perfectly, and that's why I
think this may be HAL related (I don't have HAL installed, Ubuntu has).
    Thanks in advance :)
