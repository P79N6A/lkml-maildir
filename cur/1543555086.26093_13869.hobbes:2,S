If that is true then it is a bug in either depmod or modprobe.  However
I cannot reproduce it using kernel 2.4.0-test11-pre7 and modutils
2.3.20.  In particular depmod correctly recognises that sx depends on
block_til_ready in generic_serial, not in riscom.  Which kernel, which
modutils, which .config?
