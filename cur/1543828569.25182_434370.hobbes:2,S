modprobe fbcon
modprobe nvidiafb
Display is messed up.
I used to fix this by switching to X and back but the nvidia X driver
won't build on the mm kernel. I can try again and write a script to
echo a mode into sysfs after the modprobe.
When fbcon first gets a new fbdev driver registered with it, should it
pick one of the modes is supports and set it automatically?

How does vbetool save state? Could VGAcon do whatever vbetool is doing?
