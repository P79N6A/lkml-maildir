Hi Justin,
  your new driver complains loudly here, because of
ahc_match_scb is invoked with NULL scb, and it does not like that.
Call trace was:
   0xc01c9073: ahc_match_scb + 23/191
   0xc01c945d: ahc_search_qinfifo+ 333/1719 (it is first of two calls to ahc_match...)
   0xc01c9ede: ahc_abort_scbs + 102/758
I was too lazy to write down rest of oops from screen, but if you want,
I can catch them again.
My Adaptec is vid/did 9004:6178, subsystem vid/did 9004:7861 -
AHA-2940AU Single, and there is nothing connected to it currently. 
With -ac11 it works correctly, and I skipped -ac12.
Machine is dual PIII/800, and has enabled all debug options
except DEBUG_IOVIRT (i.e. it has enabled SLAB redzoning, if it
could make difference for your driver... it makes difference for
ncpfs ncp_d_validate :-( )
                                        Thanks,
                                                Petr Vandrovec
                                                vandrove@vc.cvut.cz
