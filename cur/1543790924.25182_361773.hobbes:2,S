I think the 'goto' is fine as presumably an error from vmtruncate
means that nothing was changed, and as there are no other attr bits,
there is no need to mark_inode_dirty.
However, there always will be other ATTR bits as whenever we set
ATTR_SIZE (do_truncate and nfsd_setattr) we also set ATTR_CTIME,
so this "optimisation" is just a waste of space.
Best make it:
>  	if (ia_valid & ATTR_SIZE)
> 		error = vmtruncate(inode, attr->ia_size);
and assume that the filesystem's ->truncate or ->setattr will still
set mtime if the size doesn't change (->truncate would have a hard
time knowing if it has changed or not, so it has to set mtime
unconditionally if it exists .. ->setattr... probably does the right
thing)
