Ah, so they aren't supposed to be the two objects themselves.  Now
that I understand what the message means, I can make some headway
into investigating what's up.

Well, I guess it's because of the way the ARM ABI works.  We have
literal pools mixed in with the text:
Disassembly of section .text:
00000000 <rest_init>:
...
  14:   e59f0030        ldr     r0, [pc, #48]   ; 4c <.text+0x4c>
  18:   ebfffffe        bl      0 <kernel_thread>
                        18: R_ARM_PC24  kernel_thread
...
  4c:   000007a0        andeq   r0, r0, r0, lsr #15
                        4c: R_ARM_ABS32 .init.text
        ...
                        50: R_ARM_ABS32 kthreadd
                        54: R_ARM_ABS32 kthreadd_task
00000058 <run_init_process>:
Disassembly of section .init.text:
000007a0 <kernel_init>:
It looks like we're going to have to jump through hoops to get the
right symbols on ARM - to get at the right symbol being referenced
you need to take account of the relocation type and therefore the
properties of the relocation, and add any offset found at the
reference address.
IOW, you need to resolve the relocation (if possible) and see which
symbol you end up pointing at.
I'm sorely lacking in detailed understanding of the ARM binutils
(it's been 12 years since I touched it), especially after the
advent of ARM EABI, so I guess I need to find someone willing in
the ARM community prepared to resolve this.
