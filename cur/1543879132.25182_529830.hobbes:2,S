ok, the spinlock in there was unneeded anwyay.
But I think this is a lockdep shortcoming - there's nothing wrong with
doing mutex_init() inside spin_lock().
debug_mutex_init() is trying to work out whether we're initialising
an already held mutex.  This has nothing to do with the spinlock
which we're holding.  Perhaps debug_check_no_locks_freed() simply
went wrong.
For Ingo - this:
