There is a perverse rule in the PC industry to the effect that "the main CPU can do
it". Why its considered such a good idea to make a $200-300 CPU do the job of a
$10-15 DSP (which is just about all a current Pentium II can do) is beyond me, but
that's how it is. In the early 90's TI, Motorola, Analog Devices and Lucent were all
battling for supremacy in the forthcoming market for motherboard DSPs. They all
implemented a range of Windows 3.1 packages for games audio, MIDI synthesis, modem,
duplex speakerphone, answering machine, and so on. In the end they all lost, as the
PC vendors backed away from doing anything. The only serious crunch that's ever been
added to the standard PC has been video acceleration, and until recently even that
seldom got onto the motherboard.
