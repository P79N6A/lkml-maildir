Lies like that deserve a direct response.
modutils is mostly done by Richard Henderson (originally Tamu now
Cygnus). Other contributors are Randy McCaskill (comm-data), the esteemed
sparc64 guru Jakub, Tom Dyas (sparc32 hacker), Michael Chastain (config
file wizard), etc ...
Not a single vendor involved. Modutils is maintained by the community.
Why don't you go and scream at the people who maintain the package, is
it perhaps because you'd look the part you really are if you spent a day
on linux-kernel howling at the volunteers who did the real work to keep
modutils happy ?

Go and read Kernighan's stuff on Unix and _tools_.

Thats actually a good question. You could keep it in a userspace database
and import the kernel symbols.

Almost all incompatibilities get caught by this. The alternative is to
tie to version information only - which is even worse. During 2.1.* we've
had a whole pile of build options affect critical object size happenings. Im
just hoping most of them got nuked for 2.2.

Tools dear boy, Tools. I can objdump pure object files. I can use libbfd
to handle them and symbol resolution. I don't have to write my own half
baked solution for it.
In addition a "simple module format" doesn't work on some platforms. I doubt
your vision of such things includes half word relocates, MIPS gp relative
relocations, ARM 26bit relocations - does it ?

A special purose ELF format reading library. You mean libbfd. Good isnt it.
Tools again. The entire insmod/rmmod is 3000 lines including back compatibility

Because 
	a) I want to be able to use standard tools on them
	b) The ram disk (initrd) solves this problem while solving some
	   hundreds of other problems like bootstrapping strange diskless
	   setups. It comes for free - tools tools and more tools

Except for the "why arent the symbols in pageable space" come back when you
have something _worth_ saying.
