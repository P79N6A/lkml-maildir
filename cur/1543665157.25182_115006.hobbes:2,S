I must have missed something here.  What other 2 oopses are you referring to?
I understand that other oopses could make a third one bogus, but I didn't
see 2 others.  Did I miss them?  How did you get that information?
I'll look in the kernel log tonight (at home) to see if I missed them.
As for closing bug reports because they are not reproducible...
sure, people do it, and whoever wants to can close bug reports for that reason,
but you won't catch me doing that.  It's a poor reason to close a bug report
IMO.
