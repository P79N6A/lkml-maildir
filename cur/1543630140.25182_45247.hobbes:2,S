I've been using it quite fruitfully.  I think taking it out of 2.4 isn't
a good decision.  If 2.4 is supposed to be a stable tree with few major
changes, suddenly taking out functionality that some people rely on
seems inconsistent with that goal.  This action would be much more fatal
for the average person who doesn't routinely add feature patchsets to
their kernels, unlike most of us.
However, I am by no means saying khttpd deserves to be in the kernel,
per se.  But the decision to remove or not should be a consensus either
way.
Taking it out of 2.5 seems like a very good idea, especially if it's not
being maintained, and especially once TUX2 becomes production-quality,
Replace khttpd with TUX2 in 2.5, says this 'more silent' khttpd user. :)
