It can scribble on memory it shouldn't.

Yes, I'll give you a patch to change the resier4 code in -mm then (if
its not already been changed).

The compressed cache code might be one exception since it does the
compression itself and shouldn't get corrupted. If it does get
corrupted, you have bigger problems.
I'll provide a patch to update the LZO code in -mm to add unsafe to the
name.
