I'm preparing to test it. However, it seems that my version of
mxser_new.c got out of sync with your one:
osv@osv mxser_new$ patch -p3 < lock.patch
patching file mxser_new.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 1900 (offset -368 lines).
Hunk #2 succeeded at 1968 (offset -354 lines).
osv@osv mxser_new$ patch -p3 < rmmod.patch
patching file mxser.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 711 with fuzz 2 (offset -6 lines).
patching file mxser_new.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 705 with fuzz 2 (offset -1985 lines).
osv@osv mxser_new$
I'll try this one anyway, but could you please either tell me where to
get the version you are using, or just send it to me by mail?
BTW, when system hangs, SysRq magic doesn't work anymore.
