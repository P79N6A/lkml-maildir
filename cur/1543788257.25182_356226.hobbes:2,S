Ok, I've applied this one, and the other "convert the input drivers to
be dynamic" to my tree, as this is all great work.
I'll work on the last few patches that you have, with regard to how to
tie it into sysfs "properly" now, and get back to you, just wanted to
apply all of these, so we have a common base to work on.
Oh, I did change one thing in this patch:

I made that EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL().  Let me know if you object to this.
