ouch, that was too soon. the new driver performs better, but not 100%
without timeouts.

a 10 Mbps hub, half duplex connection. I tried with a Surecom and an Asante
hub. I also tried connection the two machines I've been testing with
with a crossover-cable, but things went worse then.

old driver, kernel 2.4.19, debug level 2:
