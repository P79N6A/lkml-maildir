My fault :-( I cleaned up sysrq a little bit in relationship to the VT
system. The change effected more drivers than I thought. Try
console_8.diff again. I put a new version of the patch up. 
http://www.transvirtual.com/~jsimmons/console/console_8.diff
I'm glad people are testing it out before it goes into the dj tree. I will
post other patches before I send them in to be included into the dj tre
since now we are getting into changes that effect alot of drivers. 
For example fg_console will be going away very soon!!!! This willeffect
alot of drivers.
