so this is about not crashing during bootup on nodes that have CPUs but 
which have no node-specific memory attached, right?
Shouldnt kmalloc_node() be made more robust instead? I.e. push the same 
code into kmalloc_node() - and make sure it will allocate _something_? 
That would probably also fix a similar bug in net/core/skbuff.c's 
__netdev_alloc_skb(), which too passes a dev_to_node() result to an 
allocator.
