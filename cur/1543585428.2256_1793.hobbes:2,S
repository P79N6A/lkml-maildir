Hi!
I'm having some problems with ip-connection tracking and multicast packets:
the conntrack stuff doesn't seem to be able to handle multicast packets,
flooding my logs with messages like these:
Feb 28 15:53:00 procyon kernel: NAT: 0 dropping untracked packet c7105b00 1
195.38.203.147 -> 224.0.0.2
Feb 28 15:53:23 procyon kernel: NAT: 0 dropping untracked packet c7a13740 1
195.38.207.229 -> 224.0.0.2
Feb 28 15:53:26 procyon kernel: NAT: 0 dropping untracked packet c7a13740 1
195.38.207.229 -> 224.0.0.2
Feb 28 15:53:31 procyon kernel: NAT: 0 dropping untracked packet c6535a80 1
195.38.207.229 -> 224.0.0.2
Feb 28 15:54:18 procyon kernel: NAT: 0 dropping untracked packet c7a132c0 1
195.38.202.44 -> 224.0.0.2
Feb 28 15:54:21 procyon kernel: NAT: 0 dropping untracked packet c7a132c0 1
195.38.202.44 -> 224.0.0.2
(this is an old logfile, i disabled logging for these messages, because it
generated several megs each day)
I'm currently using kernel 2.4.0-test9, but a friend of mine is using 2.4.0
and is experiencing the same problem.
Is this a known problem which can't be fixed, or is it fixable? And am i
asking this question in the right place here?
Thanks for any help,
Michel Wilson
