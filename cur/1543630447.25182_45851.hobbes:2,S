OK. I was just a bit worried by the fact that I could not find any docs 
on this chipset (I have almost all Intel AGP docs so this is a bit 
frustrating :-), but if it works for you, I guess the patch is OK ;-)

:-))
Maybe add a few more comments to justify the fact that you call 
intel_830mp_setup, s.t. people reading the code in a few months won't 
ask themselves what the heck is this 845g stuff.

Nicolas.
