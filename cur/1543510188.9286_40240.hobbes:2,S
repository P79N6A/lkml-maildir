Declare your function(s) static and don't export any symbols.
The functions known to the kernel are put into the `struct
file_operations` that you declare. Its address is passed to the
kernel during initialization when you register the device. Nothing
in your module needs to have a global scope except init_module() and
cleanup_module().
If you need a working template for a module that does just about
all the stuff a module would ever need to do, download...
	ftp boneserver.analogic.com /pub/downloads/linux/module.tar.gz
It was written by Konstantyn Prokopenko of analogic fame, with a few
additions by yours truly.
Cheers,
