So you want to say that only one task could be running
at a single time 
but how to know which one 
is there any way without traversing the task list
previously i thought of for_each_process(p)
                        if(p->state==running)
but without this how to find which process is
currently running and other are sleeping 
may it is through "current"
since the current->pid is only running
but i have to run this repeatedly to get the
information of currently running process(since this
may be for a fraction of a second and i can miss that
process if my loop is longer) 
how to do that 
fast timer 
or any other way 
i am little bit confused

i want to develop a task manager for threads.
the application reads properly the process information
and the thread information but not able to refresh the
thread information as i am building my own proc file
where only threads are there 
i am distinguishing between process and thread at
fork.c
with clone_vm set..
therefore i need to know which thread is currently
running or not 
there is another problem i am discusing with you 
i want to distinguish between thread and process and
after distinguishing between user thread and kernel
thread 
but i am unable to find any condition which will be
true for kernel level thread during creation and false
for user level thread 
can you help me in this also
thanks 
sounak
