Note that..
1) I looked only at official kernel source code
and
2) I looked only at a few releases, not every patchset.
and
3) I looked only at the resulting .config file after preparing it 
with make menuconfig.
>Linux g5 2.6.10-gentoo-r6-g5 #6 SMP Wed Jan 26 23:05:05 CET 2005 ppc

 From what I can tell, the .config file is built up from different 
files. I just looked at gentoo-dev-sources for this version and it 
is, in fact, present for ppc64 in
/usr/src/linux-2.6.10-gentoo-r6/arch/ppc64/defconfig
That suggests the mechanism that generates the .config files is not 
working right under certain circumstances related to the 64bit G5.
