I asked Ingo for some advice, and he gently sent me a piece of code as an
example of how to reliably bind a task to a CPU. I tried it, and it's OK here.
I could reliably switch several times from cpu0 to cpu1, then back to cpu0.
Since it was cleaner than the previous method, I also did the same for
apm_power_off(), thus getting rid of apm_magic() and its dedicated thread.
Then again, I tested with multiple cpu switches, and every time, my system
correctly handles the case. I'm writing this mail under 2.4.19-rc5.
So here is the patch against 2.4.19-rc5, hoping it will get in this time.
I think it should apply without a glitch to 2.4.19-rc5-ac1, but don't
know about 2.5, nor even if it is needed.
Feedback welcome, of course ;-)
Cheers,
Willy
