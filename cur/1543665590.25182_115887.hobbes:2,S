Hi Roman.
Is it on your TODO list to make is more quiet?
Today kconfig dumps out a lot of info when run, making sure no-one even
notices the warnings that occur in the beginning.
When executing
$ make defconfig
$ make V=0
kconfig count for almost half of the output.
It would be really good if the following targets were quiet:
oldconfig, defconfig, all*config.
oldconfig obviously needs to display some info when asking users
for new options.
Also try executing conf with no arguments...
