Per-Arne,
[This *really* belongs in a FAQ]
There are two ways to avoid this problem.  The first and easiest is to
change the permisions of the /sbin/setsysfont script to make it non-executable.
Then there's this from {^_^} Joanne Dow [bless her], jdow@bix.com, who
FINALLY figured out what was going on!
---------------
The cure for the 21 line problem lies in creating a new file in
/etc/sysconfig. 
Name it "i18n". (i, numerals 1 and 8, n)
Include in that file the following two lines: 
SYSFONT=lat1u-08.psf.gz 
UNIMAP=iso1.uni
That will leave you with the nice full size 50 line VGA screen you originally 
asked for. Other fonts will give other line counts. (Leave the vga line in the 
boot config, though.)
I'll "leave it up to the student" to find where the fonts hide. (Hint: man
setfont)
