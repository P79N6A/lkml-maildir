You are assuming that:
1. You have battery backup, or external power never fail.
2. You don't disconnect the filesystem from the device.
3. The security level of turned on device equals to a turned off one.
4. You turn on the same device that turned off.
5. You do not wish to boot another OS on this machine.
None of the above are always true... but why assume?
Just make this work... If Nigel wish to maintain this please let him,
you can be in charge of the s2ram.
Best Regards,
Alon Bar-Lev.
