Subject: System.map does not match kernel data in 2.4.22

Hi there,
I recently upgraded to kernel 2.4.22 from 2.4.20.  After I upgraded and with
the st module loaded I started to get the following error messages when
running programs like ps:
{__ide_do_rw_disk} {GPLONLY___ide_do_rw_disk}
Warning: /boot/System.map-2.4.22 does not match kernel data.
{__ide_do_rw_disk} {GPLONLY___ide_do_rw_disk}
Warning: /usr/src/linux/System.map does not match kernel data.
However, when I unloaded the st module these error messages go away, and
when I reload the module the messages reappear.  I don't see anything
suspicious in dmesg after (un)loading the module.
I tried unpacking the kernel tar file to a new directory, then running make
distclean; make menuconfig; make dep; make bzImage; make modules, and then
went on to delete /lib/modules/2.4.22 and replacing the contents through
make modules_install, and overwrote /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.22 with
/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage and overwrote /boot/System.map-2.4.22
with /usr/src/linux/System.map.  I even went ahead and replaced the contents
of /usr/include/{asm,linux,scsi} with the contents from
/usr/src/linux/include/{asm,linux,scsi}.  The problem did not go away.
I did not get these error messages in 2.4.20.
I've attached my .config file, in case it helps.  Also, this is the output
of ver_linux:

Any ideas on how I can go about fixing this problem?  Please let me know if
you want any additional information.
Thanks a lot,
Alex
