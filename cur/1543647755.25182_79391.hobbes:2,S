Summary of changes from v2.5.41 to v2.5.42
============================================
<Andries.Brouwer@cwi.nl>
	[PATCH] isofs fix
	
	The patch below removes some dead code and nonsense code.
	The part that changes behaviour is
	
	 -       if (sbi->s_cruft == 'n' &&
	 -           (volume_seq_no != 0) && (volume_seq_no != 1)) {
	 -               printk(KERN_WARNING "Warning: defective CD-ROM "
	 -                      "(volume sequence number %d). "
	 -                      "Enabling \"cruft\" mount option.\n", volume_seq_no);
	 -               sbi->s_cruft = 'y';
	 -       }
	
	that has already bitten lots of people.
	
	Nothing is wrong with a volume sequence number different from 0 or 1.
	(Cf. Ecma-119.pdf, Sections 4.17, 4.18, 6.6.)
