Thanks.  Analyzing this it is a highly fragmented file so it the $DATA
attribute is spread over three more inodes.  Could you email them to me,
too please?  They are 0x790 (= 1936), 0x791 (= 1937), and 0x792 (1938).
You can get them like this (assuming you are using Bash as your shell):
for i in 1936 1937 1938; do
	dd if=~/mymftdump of=~/inode$i bs=1024 count=1 skip=$i
done
Once I have those I can uncompress the mapping pairs arrays in the data
extents and ask you to capture the compressed data for me.  It will be a
simple script simillar to the above...
Thanks a lot for your help.
Best regards,
	Anton
