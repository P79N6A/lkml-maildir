I'm trying to look at this, but it seems a hopeless mess: there are no
calls to any read/write semaphore routines in the NFS code.
AFAICS the second stack return point corresponds to the call to
generic_file_write() in nfs_file_write(), so I'd guess that the Oops
is actually happening somewhere there...
Hmm... Looking at the code in generic_file_write(), I see that Alan
hasn't merged in the kmap() stuff in generic_file_write()from
Linus. At the same time, the nfs_prepare_write() seems to have been
synced with Linus, and so the kmap() that used to be there has
disappeared.
As  your  config  indicates  that  you  *are*  using CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G,
perhaps one ought to start with a patch that fixes the obvious bug (in
the hope that it'll at least clean up the next Oops)...
Cheers,
  Trond
