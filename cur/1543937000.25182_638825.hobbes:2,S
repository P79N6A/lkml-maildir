Subject: [PATCH 0/4] RT: fixes for kernel build errors on MIPS RBTX4927, 2.6.24-rc7
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

From: Frank Rowand <frank.rowand@am.sony.com>
This patch series is a few small fixes to kernel build errors for
the Toshiba RBTX4927 MIPS board in the 2.6.24-rc7 kernel, with the
2.6.24-rc7-rt2 patch previously applied.  These patches are directly
related to the -rt2 patch, not to the vanilla MIPS tree.  A related
set of patches will be submitted to linux-mips.org.
