You are right.  And the reason is that platform specific drivers are not part of ACPI.
They must either be vendor documented/supplied or reverse-engineered.
Vendors have not been forthcoming with documentation or code to support
Linux laptops, and our happy team here at Intel is not allowed to be in
the reverse enginering business.
So I concur that hotkey.c is a failed experiment, and I'm going to delete it.
There is more different than common on these boxes, so it makes no sense.
video.c, however, is standard, and stays for those machines that actually
do follow the public specification.

Still true, though it is clear we'll never be able to delete platform specific parts --
just the parts that duplicate the generic standard functions..

How about 2.6.21?
What needs to happen is
1. a maintainer for sony_acpi.c needs to step forward
    I can't do this, I'm not allowed to be in the reverse engineering business.
2. /proc/acpi/sony API needs to be deleted
3. source needs to move out of drivers/acpi, and into drivers/misc along with msi.
Luming has a sony laptop and can help with this, but
he can't be the permanent maintainer any more than I can, for the same reason.
If we can get past #1, then I recommend we apply the patch series in -mm to
the acpi-test tree and go from there.
