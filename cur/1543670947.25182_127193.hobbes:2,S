The key there is -save- and restore.  The script defaults to "don't
touch" until it has a saved setting to use, which it can get either from
some user-triggered method or from a clean shutdown..
That, AFAIR, is also at least vaguely how that other desktop OS tends to
work - on shutdown save the settings, on boot restore them...
