Perhaps the problem has been fixed in 2.3.99-pre2 and later:  I'll
be able to tell in another day or so.  However, under 2.3.99-pre1
after the machine had been up for about two days, the paging
activity was so intense that overall responsiveness went into the
toilet (the machine was almost unusable).  Applications were taking
a *very* long time to launch, and moving from one virtual desktop
pane to another took several seconds for the windows in the new
desktop quadrant to repaint.  The condition came on rather slowly,
and disappeared after a reboot with the same application mix/load.
"top" confirmed that "kswapd" was *much* too busy.
Machine is a generic clone with an Intel P233 MMX and 64 MB of RAM.
