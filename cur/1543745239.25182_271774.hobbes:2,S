If you need STREAM behavior I think you need to use recv(), recvfrom(),
or read().
If you use recvmsg(), the "message" will be removed even it you haven't 
read it all. Note in the 'man' page description:
"If the a message is too long to fit in the supplied buffer, excess bytes
may be discarded depending upon the type of socket the message is being
received from..."
