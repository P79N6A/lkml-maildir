Subject: Linux-2.4.15-pre5 - probably something wrong with /proc/cpuinfo.

Hello,
The following shell script (extracted from SuSE 7.1 /etc/rc.d/boot) would 
execute fine on Linux-2.4.14, Linux-2.4.15-pre3 etc.. but not on 
Linux-2.4.15-pre5 (AMD Athlon Computer). Couldn't check it on 
Linux-2.4.15-pre4 as it would not compile successfully.
#!/bin/bash
# set and adjust the CMOS clock
if test "$HWCLOCK_ACCESS" != "no" ; then
echo -n Setting up the CMOS clock
CLOCKCMD=hwclock
while read line; do
        case "$line" in
                *MTX\ Plus*) CLOCKCMD="hwclock --mtxplus --directisa" ;;
                *PReP\ Dual\ MTX*) CLOCKCMD="hwclock --mtxplus --directisa" ;;
        esac
done < /proc/cpuinfo
fi
May someone be kind enough to let me know where the problem could be?
