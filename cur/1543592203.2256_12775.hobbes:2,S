Well, I have been fighting this for a while now, its just that today it
finally hit /home in a big way :( basically its giving a DoS trying 
to compile stuff (which needs to write 25Mb+ library files)
The drive gives the patented IBM "replace me" audio and the kernel graces
me with these little chums:
May 24 14:50:22 kloof kernel: hda: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
May 24 14:50:22 kloof kernel: hda: dma_intr: error=0x40 { UncorrectableError }, LBAsect=78294495, sector=957496
May 24 14:50:22 kloof kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev 03:08 (hda), sector 957496
May 24 14:50:22 kloof kernel: hda: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
May 24 14:50:23 kloof kernel: hda: dma_intr: error=0x40 { UncorrectableError }, LBAsect=78294495, sector=957504
May 24 14:50:23 kloof kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev 03:08 (hda), sector 957504
May 24 14:50:23 kloof kernel: hda: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
May 24 14:50:23 kloof kernel: hda: dma_intr: error=0x40 { UncorrectableError }, LBAsect=78294495, sector=957512
I already knew that the drive was rooted by using the IBM DFT tool.
I am backing up as I type. Then, roll the dice with yet another 
IBM drive :-/
