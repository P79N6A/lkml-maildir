Well that's a big step up. My horizontal scrolling is now working
perfectly. I had never in my life seen a ZAxisMapping line with 4
buttons, but it seems to do the trick, and it's even worked its way into
the mouse man page since the last time I remember seeing it. (Running
current Xorg here, can't speak for XFree86 users)
Now it's just the vertical scroller issue.
