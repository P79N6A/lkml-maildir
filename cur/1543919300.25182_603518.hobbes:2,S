oh, i know how to get around it -- i was just thinking that it
shouldn't *require* a workaround, that's all.  all of those previous
warnings and errors are clearly due to the early part of the make
testing for the appropriate arch-specific build tools without
realizing that the make target doesn't *need* any of those things just
to install headers.
