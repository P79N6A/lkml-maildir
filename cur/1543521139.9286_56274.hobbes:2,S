True. This kind of program is broken. There is no doubt about it.
Programmers are human beings and and they sometimes write "wrong" code.
They have always done that, they are doing it just now and they will
continue doing it forever. 
The problem is that there are too many programs that are broken and there
is no easy way to find them. The work required would be comparable to Y2K.
If time_t is extended it will make all those already "broken" programs to
malfunction. There is no point in breaking them now when there is still at
least 25 years time left. It's not our job to punish others just
because they have written wrong code.
I agree this problem should be fixed ASAP. However it should be done
in a way that doesn't cause completely unnecessary failures. This can be
done by introducing an alternative "right" way that can be used in all new
software.

Of cause I will take care about this kind of issues. However I cannot
guarantee that all the code I wrote 15 years ago is written in this way.

We are not in position to say that others should fix all their errors
_NOW_ before upgrading to the next Linux version. There is even no
guarantee that all the errors can be fixed. It's not so easy to convert
complex data files to a new format. And what if the error is not noticed
before some program damages the file after it has been recompiled to use
new 64 bit time_t.

I would not call this punishment. If the application is correctly written
then a simple search/replace operation is enought to convert it to use the
new interface. It's even possible to write an utility that does all this
automagically. And there is even no need to do anything in near future.
