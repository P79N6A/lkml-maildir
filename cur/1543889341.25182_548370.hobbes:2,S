This message is about device 01:00.0 as it says (your nvidia video
card based on later lspci output).

This is device 06:00.0, so it's not related to that earlier message at
all.  You didn't say what problem you're having with your driver for
this device... but all standard PCI stuff should work fine for PCIe
devices -- the normal PCI driver stuff is all you should need for
everything but exotic cases.
