Hi,
The patch for the generic HDLC layer was included on the kernel 2.4.21. Thus
this layer is already on the main tree (unless, of course, someone has
removed it, I havent checked 2.4.22 yet). This layer provides data link
protocol (ppp, hdlc, raw-hdlc, x25, frame-relay, cisco-hdlc) for the kernel.
It's mainly used by synchronous cards drivers (Cyclades, Moxa, SDL, Farsite,
etc, etc, etc).
regards
Henrique
