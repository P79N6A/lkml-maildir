How far is the IDE changer code? Can I put a couple (four) IDE CD changers
into my server so that it can act as CD jukebox, and this works? The disks
will be (more or less) all mounted, or probably I will configure autofs. It
would be nice if someone could patch autofs so that it mounts all CDs under
/autofs/$CDROM_LABEL, any idea about this?
