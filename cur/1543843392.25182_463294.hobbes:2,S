Yes it could.  The centrino was the first platform I tested on and I used the
existing speedstep-centrino code from cpufreq.  The 1.86Ghz  was not in
the cpufreq base.    But you can see how easy it is to add new operating points
for a new cpu.
Adding new platform support is quite straight forward.  It basically requires
a function to transition to the new operating point and the parameters needed
for the transition.
