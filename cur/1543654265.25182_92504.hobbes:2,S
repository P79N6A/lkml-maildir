My Debian system doesn't load the modules anymore. And I have asked this on
the mailinglist last week, but nobody seemed to care :-(
I am curious how your Debian system was able to boot without problems. On
my system I have configured quite a few modules, and some of them seem to
be loaded by hotplug and some by init scripts. All I see is a lot of
commandline errors from modprobe, and a lot of messages like
  QM_MODULES: Function not implemented
