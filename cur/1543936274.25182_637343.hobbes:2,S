I don't think so.

Forget about this unrelated feature, it has nothing to do with this
situation. What if some (eg) sata driver broke because someone enabled
CONFIG_NO_HZ. Would you say that's not a regression because it worked
before that option was there? That's crap, no user would buy that
argument. As far as the user is concerned, it IS a regression.
Since we obviously disagree on this, lets agree to not debate it any
further. It doesn't matter anyway, since the issue is resolved.

How does that compare to sched_clock()? 3-6 usec would render blktrace
unusable for certain types of testing, unfortunately. This isn't just
queried per IO, it's done for every action for that IO. So you'd
typically have up to eg 10 traces for a single IO piece, perhaps even
more.
For 2.6.24 the solution is fine, I'll revisit the impact when I can.
