Johannes and I had agreed with Andrew that the redesigned frontend code 
should stay in -mm for now, because we expect that support for some 
cards is broken. We currently don't receive very much reports on the 
mailing list though.

I just spoke to Johannes and we agree with you, Gerd. The DVB changes 
can and should be merged from -mm now. There is a fair chance that the 
remaining issues with broken cards can be resolved before 2.6.10.
The code is in a good shape and only some small patches are missing from 
the LinuxTV.org CVS.
I can prepare a patch that fixes the support for some cards and other 
minor improvements tomorrow.
