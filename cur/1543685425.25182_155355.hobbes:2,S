Hi , i tryed to get all vmas with this piece of code :
....
struct task_struct *task = find_task_by_pid();
struct vm_area_struct *vma,*next;
vma = task->mm->mmap;
while(vma)
{
     next = vma->vm_next;
    my_function();
    ....
    vma = next;
 }
but when i do insmod procm.o ... the program seems to enter in an infinite
loop.
Am I getting all vmas with this while() ?
thanks
Breno
