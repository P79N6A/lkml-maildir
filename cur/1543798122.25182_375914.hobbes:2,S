It's more convenient for shell scripts to get cpu topology info from sysfs.

There is no appropriate file to write down the info under Documentation.

No. The node and related data are created/registered only when cpu is CPU_ONLINE. If CPU_UP_CANCELED is delivered to the notifier, the cpu is not online, and its node is not registered, so we needn't do anything when CPU_UP_CANCELED.

I don't quite understand what you said. My patch just uses the attribute address (a kind of data, not function) as parameter. If the function needs to be shrunken, I think I have to define a sub function per attribute which causes even longer code size.
