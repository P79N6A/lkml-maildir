reparent_thread:
	...
        /* If we'd notified the old parent about this child's death,
         * also notify the new parent.
         */
        if (!traced && p->exit_state == EXIT_ZOMBIE &&
            p->exit_signal != -1 && thread_group_empty(p))
                do_notify_parent(p, p->exit_signal);
We notified /sbin/init. If it ignores SIGCHLD, we should release the task.
We don't do this.
The best fix I believe is to cleanup the forget_original_parent/reparent_thread
interaction and factor out this "exit_state == EXIT_ZOMBIE && exit_signal == -1"
checks.
Oleg.
