I think you people didn't understand what is wrapfs, if is only a template
for FiST. The aim is to provide a properly maintained stackable template
under linux, and so that people can use FiST to develop their own
filesystem. Currently the wrapfs template is so buggy, I spend weeks to
fix all the bugs and even rewriting some of the code to make it more
efficient. This dosn't means --bind, it means it also fix up tons of FS'es
that is previously produced by using the old buggy FiST template, FiST is
good for developing new stackable file system, the current problem is that
the templates are buggy.... you got it??? If you know something is good
but it is not properly maintained, why not give it a hand and do all the
people a flavour?

David
