By what my output is showing, I don't think the USB device is being 
registered with input correctly.
Your dmesg line:
input2: USB HID v1.10 Mouse [Logitech USB Receiver] on usb1:2.1
My dmesg line:
: USB HID v1.10 Mouse [Logitech USB Receiver] on usb2:4.0
I don't have the first field on mine.
Any ideas?

David
