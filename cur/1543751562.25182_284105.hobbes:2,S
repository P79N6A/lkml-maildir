No, you can't, because by the time the syscall returns to you, it's
blocked, scheduled, unblocked, and been rescheduled.  It's too late.  I
don't think you can do what you want, without modifying all the syscalls
directly.
Besides, most blocks are for data, not on something like a semaphore.
What you really want is priority-inheritance semaphores, not
modification of syscalls.  I seem to remember someone working on such a
beast, and the RTOS versions of Linux presumably have something like
this, so you could check around.
