Yes.  That's because we want to be able to repeat creating the image
without closing the fd in some situations.

Still, we could use a global var 'platform_hibernation' or something like this,
I think.  Then, we can do
#define platform_hibernation	0
on the architectures that don't need it and make ACPI use it instead of this
"dynamic linking".
