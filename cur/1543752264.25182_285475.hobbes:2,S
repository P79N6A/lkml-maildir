For me when running growisofs  with user permissions on 2.6.10 (ide-cd) it 
works perfectly 1st time but 2nd time fails with the error below. It works 
fine when run as root.
:-( unable to PREVENT MEDIA REMOVAL: Operation not permitted
As an aside audio cd burning with cdrecord works as long as the '-text' option 
isn't used, if it is the process hangs.
