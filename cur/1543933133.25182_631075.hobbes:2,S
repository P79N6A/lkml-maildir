I'm not qualified to give an opinion on what's proper for the
kernel, so all I can say is that I've applied it (to fresh 2.6.24-rc6
source without Shaohua's pnpacpi patch) and it works nicely for me.
From /proc/ioports:
0290-029f : pnp 00:01
  0290-0294 : pnp 00:01
  0295-0296 : it87
    0295-0296 : it87
From dmesg:
system 00:01: ioport range 0x290-0x29f has been reserved
...
system 00:01: ioport range 0x290-0x294 has been reserved
My sensors work.
Thanks for this patch,
Mike Houston
