Should be enough, you'll likely get at least a timer 
interrupt in the middle of v86 mode sooner or later.

I see, I missed the 32 in mouse32.

Well, I did not express myself correctly. OS/2 was probably the 
most frightening mix of 16 and 32 bit code ever produced, so 
they certainly had to work around the problem. There
were literally tons of "thunks" to interface both modes
and the LDT was set up in a way which made the translation
of addresses relatively easy:
  off32 = (seg16>>3) + off16
Therefore the base address of LDT segment n was n*64k,
limiting the addressable memory to 512MB in all versions
I used (later versions lifted this limit), but making
conversions of 16 to 32 bit addresses and back quite
efficient. However, I can't remember exactly how the 
thunks worked.
