So, for drives with LBA48, you enable barriers either if report to
support it or if their capacity is _smaller_ than 2^28. If neither
is the case, it's left disabled and the kernel complains.
Is it safe to enable for 
(addressing == 1 && !ide_id_has_flush_cache_ext() && capacity <= 1<<28)
?
Shouldn't we check ide_has_flush_cache() then, as for the non-
LBA48 drives?
