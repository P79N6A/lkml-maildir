YUCK
Well IRIX boxes tend to have a PROM in which there is a file system
and a disk driver, thus when the system goes totally boink they can
escape to those and still do the core dump. That is pretty hard on
todays PC hardware.
Other than that I still haven't found much more useful info in those
monster dumps you get on commercial system than what the OOPS provides.
