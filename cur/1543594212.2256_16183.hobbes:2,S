First, please try with a recent 2.4.5ac kernel - a number of ATM bugfixes
have been made recently and they've been merged first with alan's
branch.  Anyway, there's a chance that you might just be hitting one of
those bugs that have already been fixed, so it'd be best to try that
first so we can exclude that possibility.

Please read the REPORTING-BUGS and Documentation/oops-tracing.txt files
in the linux source tree - especially the parts about using the
"ksymoops" tool.  These numbers are useless to us unless you run it
through that tool first.
