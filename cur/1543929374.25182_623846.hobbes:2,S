Ack.  And what of the suggestion to try to ensure that a yielding task
simply not end up as the very next one chosen to run?  Maybe by swapping
it with another (adjacent?) task in the tree if it comes out on top again?
(I really don't know the proper terminology to use here,
 but hopefully Ingo can translate that).
That's probably already been covered too, but are the prior conclusions still valid?
Thanks Ingo -- I *really* like this scheduler!
