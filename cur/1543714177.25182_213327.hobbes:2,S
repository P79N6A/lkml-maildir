I still don't know the root cause of my ever increasing ping
latencies.  However, I can report that if I compile all the netfilter
helpers as modules, rather than statically linking them, that everything
runs fine.
This has solved my immediate problem, so I've turned my attention to other
things.  As far as I know, though, there's still something amiss.
I have another machine that's not in production yet running 2.6.5.  I'm
adopted the habit of compiling netfilter stuff as modules, but I'll
statically link everything and run it that way to see what I can see.
