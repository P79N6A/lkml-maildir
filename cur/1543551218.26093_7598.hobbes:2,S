if you look at the way get_ksyms_list() (in kernel/module.c) walks the
module_list and prints the hex address and the human readable name of each
exported symbol in a module, you will understand how to map a name to
address.
But I am sure Keith knows of a better way.... looking at his latest kdb
patch.... Indeed, there is a function called get_module_symbol() (in
kernel/module.c) which gets the address of a symbol in the given module.
Actually, this doesn't even require kdb -- it is in the plain vanilla
kernel and is even exported to modules...
