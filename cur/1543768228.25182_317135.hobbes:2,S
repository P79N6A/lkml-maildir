Why do you need that? u32 ID space is not enough?

Compare the implementaion - without variable-length notification
requests the code is much simplier and flexible.

What is the average expected rate for such messages? Not particularly
high I think. We just need to sustain sudden bursts, naive work
allocation will work just fine here.

What layers? Connector core is not an onion, with my patch it is 481
line .c file(down from 900+), comments probably take 1/3 of it. We
just need to keep it simple, that's all.

As in "I tried to run it and adjusted the application for the new
cn_notify_req size and it does not work" or "I am saying it does not
work"?

There is a right design change - it keeps the code simple. It peels
all the layers you invented for something that does not really need
layers - connector is just a simple wrapper over raw netlink.
When I look at the code I see the mess of unneeded refcounting, wrong
kinds of locking, over-engineering. Of course I want to change it.
Keep it simple. Except for your testing environment why do you need to
have separate netlink sockets? You have an ample ID space. Why do you
need separate cn_dev and cn_queue_dev (and in the end have them at
all)? Why do you need "input" handler, do you expect to use different
handlers? If so which? And why? Do you expect to use other transports?
If so which? And why? You need to have justifiction for every
additional layer you putting on.

Yes, you are probably right, sorry for the noise...
