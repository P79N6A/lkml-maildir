A lot of talk here has been about syslog and DNS blocking, but the
original message mentioned:
> If you send SIGSTOP to syslogd on a Red Hat 6.2 system (glibc 2.1.3,
> kernel 2.2.x), within a few minutes you will find your entire machine
> grinds to a halt.  For example, nobody can log in.
Has this been addressed (and I missed it) or did the question get
diverted?  If it has been addressed, just please mail me personally to
save traffic on the list.
Thanks!
