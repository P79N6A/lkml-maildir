I just reread those NUMA changes, and they changed the heuristics
for sizing things at the same time as moving over to the
alloc_large_system_hash() change.
The change was to move from (21 - PAGE_SHIFT) and (23 - PAGE_SHIFT)
to (25 - PAGE_SHIFT) and (27 - PAGE_SHIFT) respectively.
This is the part of the NUMA TCP changes that made the sysctl setting
behavior differ.
Andi's patch is the least intrusive fix for 2.6.12, so I will
apply it.  But longer term these heuristics need to be revisited
as a whole.
