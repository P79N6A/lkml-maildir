I think Ashok is referring to first.

I dont think it is that simple. 
First, do we handle the pending interrupt as normal interrupts? For ex: in 
case of call function interrupt, do we read the call_data_struct, which may be
stale if we are handling a stale IPI (IPI that was sent to us but caller
didnt wait for us to read the call_data_struct)?
Ideally we have to drop (not handle) such stale interrupts. Which 
means add a flag in the interrupt handler. If flag is set, interrupt
is dropped otherwise it is handled. This flag may be set by the upcoming
CPU before doing STI. It may be cleared by it after a brief time after STI.
And this may affect the fast path.
Alternately we may register dummy handlers for various IRQs, sti, wait
for pending IRQs to be flushed and then register the real handlers (and
_then_ set the CPU in the online map?)
Secondly, I think there is another subtle race if we broadcast IPIs. Consider 
this:
	CPU0			CPU1
				Puts itself Offline
	smp_call_function
	   broadcasts IPI
					IPI queued on CPU1
					Wants to come online now
					spin_lock(call_lock)	
	spin_lock(call_lock)		cpu_set(cpu1, online_map);
					spin_unlock(call_lock);
		broadcast IPI	
		wait_for_all_cpus
		(including CPU1)
					sti();
					gets IPI, but decides to not handle
					it since it may be a stale IPI
This causes CPU0 to wait forever? Not sure if I have missed some h/w subtelity 
here.
This problem could probably be prevented if cpu1 is set in the online_map
after the sti.

The problem is at the time smp_call_function was running on CPU0 say,
only CPU1 and CPU2 were online. So it decides that it has to wait for
2 CPUs to ack the IPI. Next it broadcasts the IPI. At this particular
point, CPU3 is coming up and is yet to do a STI. Meanwhile, CPU1 and CPU2
ACK CPU0's call_function IPI. Hence smp_call_function on CPU0 decides to 
return, which makes call_data_struct stale (since it was on the stack). After 
this CPU3 does a STI and gets now the call_function IPI. If it were to handle
this IPI normally, it will read the stale call_data_struct and may 
crash. Ideally, CPU3 should have dropped that stale IPI.
I think doing a send_IPI_mask is a safe solution for this problem,
unless h/w avoids broadcasting IPIs to offline CPUs.
