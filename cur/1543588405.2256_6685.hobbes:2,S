Hello!
	I was compiling kernel 2.4.3 and got this:
buz.c: In function `v4l_fbuffer_alloc':
buz.c:188: `KMALLOC_MAXSIZE' undeclared (first use in this function)
buz.c:188: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
buz.c:188: for each function it appears in.)
buz.c: In function `jpg_fbuffer_alloc':

buz.c:256: warning: `alloc_contig' might be used uninitialized in this

In kernel 2.4.2, instead of KMALLOC_MAXSIZE, there is MAX_KMALLOC_MEM
which is defined at the beginning of the file buz.c (2.4.2) as
(512*1024). The compilation went ok after I did define KMALLOC_MAXSIZE.
There should not be any problem as I don't think I need the buz driver, I
had just unknowingly put at into the config. However, I guess it should be
fixed.
