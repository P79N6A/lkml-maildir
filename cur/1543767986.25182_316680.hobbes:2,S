That *might* be the case for a current one; but I'm sure dual core
processors will end up sharing a level of cache/bus arbitration
sometime.  Anyway it is a bit nasty not to real dual-core'd ness
to things, after all they might get upset if someone tried to hotswap
one.....

P.S. On the side note of early dual core chips; there is an R65c00/21
and R65c29 listed in a 1985 Rockwell datasheet I've got - dual 6502s!
