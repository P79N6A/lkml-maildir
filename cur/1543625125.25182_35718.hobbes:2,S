To do it in user space, you have to use the raw socket interface. This
by-passes the entire TCP/IP stack. I want to sniff the packets, and make a
decision based on certain characteristics of each packet. So I need to
have a filter between the IP and link-layer. Also, I do not want the
filter to slow down traffic. Hence I believe implementing inside kernel
will be more efficient.
