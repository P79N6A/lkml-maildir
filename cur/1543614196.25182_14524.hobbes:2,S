 find . -name "*.?" | xargs grep MiB | wc
     46 lines, half of which seem to live in "jedec_probe.c".
 find . -name "*.?" | xargs grep -w MB | wc
    302 lines.  And that's just upper case, whole word, not "MBs" or "Mb" or 
any other fun little variation...
 find . -name "*.?" | xargs grep -i MEGABYTE | wc
     31 lines.
 find . -name "*.?" | xargs grep -i MEBIBYTE | wc
      1 line, and it's a comment saying it's NOT being used (along with one 
of the MiB hits).
If you're going with a uniform terminology argument, you should drop MiB 
altogether.  Unless you want to submit a patch to the kernel to standardize 
all the other occurences everywhere else? :)
