If you're adding this, you should probably schedule EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL
for removal at the same time, as this essentially renders that irrelevant.
That being said...
First, this is adding the measure at module load time. Any copyright
infringment happens on distribution; module load isn't (necessarily)
that; if I write random code and load it, without ever sending it
to anyone, I'm not violating the license, and this would prevent that.
So it seems somewhat misplaced.
Secondly...

There's nothing stopping you undertaking these means now. Addition of
this measure doesn't change the copyright status of any code - what was
a violation before would still be a violation. Copyright's not something
like trademark, where it's sue-or-lose - there's no requirement for
constant action, and there's no requirement for enforcement measures.
If I reproduce and start selling copies of the White album, it doesn't
matter that there wasn't a mechanism on the CD that prevented me doing
that - it's still a copyright violation.
Hence, the only purpose of a clause like this legally would seem to be
to *intentionally* go after people using the DMCA. Which seems... tacky.
Of course, I don't have significant code of note in the kernel, so I can't
really prevent you from doing this if you want...
