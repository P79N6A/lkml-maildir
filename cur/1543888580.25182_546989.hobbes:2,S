I guess I'll take time out from coding to chime in.
cfs should probably consider aggregate lag as opposed to aggregate
weighted load. Mainline's convergence to proper CPU bandwidth
distributions on SMP (e.g. N+1 tasks of equal nice on N cpus) is
incredibly slow and probably also fragile in the presence of arrivals
and departures partly because of this. Tong Li's DWRR repairs the
deficit in mainline by synchronizing epochs or otherwise bounding epoch
dispersion. This doesn't directly translate to cfs. In cfs cpu should
probably try to figure out if its aggregate lag (e.g. via minimax) is
above or below average, and push to or pull from the other half
accordingly.
