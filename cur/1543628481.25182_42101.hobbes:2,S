Come on, you've already shown in this thread that you retract
your own statements every time the thread takes a turn.
I guess I'll state for the record that I don't object to idealists,
it's armchair idealists I resent.
The kind of people who want to impose a view of the world on
others that they'd never impose on themselves, the kind of
people who preach free software but work for a distro that
includes non-free software, the kind of people who want to
retroactively change their statements whenever they are
inconvenienced by them.
You know who you are.
regards,
Rik
