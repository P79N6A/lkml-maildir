The degredations were seen on SMP (though I can also see them on NUMA).
You should be able to get access to a largish SMP (or even NUMA) box
via OSDL. Alternatively, I should be able to run some tests on Monday,
once the power is back in our lab (grrrr). Sounds like test order of
the day is:
test4
test4 + "Andrew's patch" (whatever that was, and whichever Andrew ;-))
test4 + Andrew + Con
test4 + Andres + Nick.
Though the results weren't as extreme on my machine, they were 10% or
so, and I can probably beat jbb into running fairly easily, or Mark
can do that one.
