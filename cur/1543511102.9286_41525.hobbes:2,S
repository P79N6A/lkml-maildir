Wrong. unused is for freed inodes. Inodes in in_use with zero i_count can
be immediately taken (without read_inode()). It _is_ needed - take it away
and you will get a helluva lot of fs accesses. Think of soft pagefaults.
iput() moves the thing to unused if it is unhashed (and thus can not be
ever found via hash lookup). Real cleaning is left to free_inodes() when
and if necessary.
However, scanning the list is probably an overkill - I'll look if we can
make the things better. In principle, iput() might move the stuff out of
in_use (in separate list), provided that iget()/igrab() would care to put
them back. I'm not on a Linux box right now, so I can't tell whether it
will be enough. I'll check it this evening, OK?
