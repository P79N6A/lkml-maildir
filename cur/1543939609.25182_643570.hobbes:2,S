that "slim" combination is what i use for about 25% of all my bisections 
- i build, boot and stress-test randconfig configs.
If i find a problem with a given .config, i do _not_ go around and 
change the .config to make a bisection point work. (and the automated 
bisection scripts definitely wont do it either.)
so what is a 'weird config' to you is a real testing barrier for others. 
And crap like that quickly mounts up. Having a buildable and bootable 
kernel at every bisection point is a _must_.
Please! :-)
