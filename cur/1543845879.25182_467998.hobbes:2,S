	That's too old, the cutoff is 27-pre15.

	That's exactly the point of this warning (some distro like to
kill it), I think it spells pretty clearly what's wrong. Don't say I
did not warn you...

	If you run a custom kernel, I think you won't see any problems
running a custom version of Wireless Tools. They are available on my
web site, pretty easy to install, and have minimal
implications. Usually distro do no customisation of my tools.
	On the other hand, FC6, which is in beta, contains already the
proper version of the tools. I have been monitoring the various distro
in the last few months before sending those WE-21 patches, and all
major distro have WT-28 in the pipeline.
	Actually, you might be able to install the wireless-tools RPM
of FC6 of FC-dev onto your FC5.
