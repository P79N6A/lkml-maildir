Subject: [PATCH] sys_unshare: remove a broken CLONE_SIGHAND code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/23/199

sys_unshare(CLONE_SIGHAND) is broken, the code under 'if (new_sigh)' is
never executed but very wrong. Just remove it to avoid a confusion,
task_lock() has nothing to do with ->sighand changing.
Also, change the comment in unshare_sighand(). Yes, CLONE_THREAD implies
CLONE_SIGHAND, but still it looks confusing. Also, we don't need to check
current->sighand != NULL.
