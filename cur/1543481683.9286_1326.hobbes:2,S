Here's a code snippet from a module I'm compiling against the 2.2.0-pre9
source:
	if (ecrval & 0x02) {
		/* FIFO is full. Wait for interrupt. */
		outb (ecrval & ~(1<<2), ecr); /* serviceIntr */
	false_alarm:
		timer.expires = jiffies + HZ;
		timer.data = (unsigned long) port;
		timer.function = (timer_fn) parport_ieee1284_wakeup;
		add_timer (&timer);
		printk (KERN_DEBUG "down_interruptible returned %d\n",
			down_interruptible (&port->ieee1284.sem));
		del_timer (&timer);
		if (signal_pending (current)) {
			printk (KERN_DEBUG "Signal pending\n");
			break;
		}
		printk (KERN_DEBUG "No signal pending\n");
		if (!time_before (jiffies, expire)) {
			/* Timed out. */
			printk (KERN_DEBUG "Timed out\n");
			break;
		}
		ecrval = inb (ecr);
		if (!(ecrval & (1<<2)))
			goto false_alarm;
			continue;
	}
parport_ieee1284_wakeup is a function that calls up(&port->ieee1284.sem),
although it will never get called in this example.  I'm expecting
down_interruptible to sleep for one second at a time.  The semaphore is
initialised to 0.  This code is supposed to give up after five seconds.
What actually happens is this: the first time I hit this code, the machine
freezes for five seconds.  down_interruptible returns zero and no signal
is pending.  Presumably down_interruptible returns immediately, since no
other processes are getting scheduled.
I kill the process, and down_interruptible returns -EINTR.  I try again.
This time, down_interruptible doesn't return.  Not after one second, not
after five seconds, and not after a minute.
This code worked fine in pre7, I'm sure of it.  I'll do more testing
later.
Can anyone shed any light on this?
Tim.
