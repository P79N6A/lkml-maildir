For what it's worth, I figured out the below problem. I was able to set
XMMS' ALSA output to Wave instead of PCM and can now adjust the volume
as I could with OSS. Also, for gkrellm, the digital out volume is now
PCM2 rather than just PCM.
Now I can adjust my XMMS volume with my Playstation controller again! :)
The USB converter and a USB extension were two of the best purchases
I've made for my system.
