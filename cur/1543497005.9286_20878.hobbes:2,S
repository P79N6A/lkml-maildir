No, there should be three :-). The 2.2.x kernels and beyond automatically
create routes when an interface is configured. Earlier kernels did not
do this so routes had to be added afterwards so diald does this itself.
Hence there will be two copies of the point to point route.
  There is only one copy of the default route because the kernel cannot
infer this from the interface config so it only exists because diald
adds it.

This does not make sense. Packets go via the slip link to diald. Diald
sees traffic, makes a connection and runs pppd on it. Once pppd is
running diald sets routes through it. If you do not have a route
through the ppp interface when the link is "up" it is because diald
does not believe the link _is_ up. This is typical of a misconfigured
system - often because you have silly options in the global pppd
config (/etc/ppp/options) or because you are confused about the
difference between diald's seperate chat then pppd and the all-in-one
pppd connect "...". It seems that either major distributions are
getting this wrong or someone has written a completely bogus HOWTO.

If diald is shut down reasonably cleanly it deletes the routes it creates.
If it crashes it doesn't. Old diald's may not actually down the slip
interface though - which is the right thing to do, of course.
  Incidentally diald 0.16 is *ancient*. Distributors should, at least,
be using 0.16.5 which Eric released a long time ago. Since then I've
taken over diald and newer (current 0.99) versions are available
from 
http://diald.unix.ch
