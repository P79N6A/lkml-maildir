Let me bend your suggestion slightly and suggest that for a task which
shares fd with the leader, /proc/N/task/M/fd would be a symlink to
/proc/M/fd, and if fd's were not shared it would be a directory. That
would make it easy for programs like lsof to know when to look and whn
not.
This doesn't prevent your suggestion which triggered the thought, it
just seems to avoid having a boatload of symlinks for the most common
case when one would do.
