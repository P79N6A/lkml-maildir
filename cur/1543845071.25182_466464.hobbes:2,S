If this is really 1/1 why does it patch a file called pda.h? 
I've thrown away the local pda patches before this because I assumed
you started fresh.
Somehow I'm not surprised that nothing applies.  You seem to always
start with some random tree that nobody else has.
Anyways, this patchkit has caused so much trouble and churn that I'll drop
it for now until after the .19 merge is done.
