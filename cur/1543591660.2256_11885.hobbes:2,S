You are not. Control streams in question look like normal files. Normally
driver exports a tree with several data files (e.g. fd0, fd1, fd2, fd3)
and several control files (e.g. fd0ctl, fd1ctl, fd2ctl, fd3ctl). write()
to the latter passes commands. No extra syscalls needed.
Notice that sometimes it's not ASCII - depends on the nature of stuff you
are passing. Things like setting font, etc. need to pass bitmaps, so some
parts of the stuff you write end up as binary. Which is perfectly sane.

s/possible/makes sense/. For commands ASCII is OK, but for cases when you
pass binary data as a part of command (not just "something large", but
something that really happens to be a bitmap, etc.) you write it as binary
data.
