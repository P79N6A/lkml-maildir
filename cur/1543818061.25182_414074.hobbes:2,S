This field was introduced to have a clear property description. The
rating field might be used for this, but from a given rating on a
particular CPU architecture it might be hard to deduce whether this
clock source is good enough so we can switch to high resolution timer
mode.
is_continous is maybe not the best choice, but a flag field to retrieve
certain properties would be a good thing to have.
