It was in the inital report, at
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9217
 :
: I try to upgrade kernel from 2.6.22.9 to 2.6.23.
: 2.6.22.9 works correct. Kernel 2.6.23 doesn't use  CONFIG_CMDLINE and doesn't
: pass bootparams:
: CONFIG_CMDLINE="console=ttyS0,115200n8 console=tty1 noinitrd
: root=/dev/mmcblk0p1 rootfstype=ext3 rw rootdelay=5"
: But kernel still try to mount /dev/mtdblock2 using jffs2.
: Steps to reproduce:
: Compile kernel with CONFIG_CMDLINE and try to boot.
