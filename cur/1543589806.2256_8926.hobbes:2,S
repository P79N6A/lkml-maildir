Just to let linux-kernel know:
I'm working on the Compaq Hotplug PCI driver.  The latest version should
work with most Intel motherboards that support Hotplug PCI.  The patch
is currently available against 2.4.4 at:

Many thanks to Dely Sy at Intel for his help in getting the driver
working on my motherboard.
There is much more to be done to the driver before it can be included in
the kernel tree, but if anyone wants to try it out, please do.
thanks,
greg k-h
