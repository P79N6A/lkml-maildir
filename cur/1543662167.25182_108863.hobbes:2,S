Thanks Dave,
I think I know what the problem is here.  I tried to adapt some code I 
used at unmount for the sync_fs call, but I screwed up.  The routine is 
waiting until all the journal writes have completed but it doesn't 
anticipate (or prevent) new activity.  The code times out after a while 
because a BUG at unmount time is easier to track down than a hang.
I'll work on a real patch, but this should work in the mean time.  
(Pardon the compiler warning.)
