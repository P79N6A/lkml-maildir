No. It says that /dev/urandom "contains" an unlimited amount
of bits - you can read as many bits from there as you want,
while /dev/random "contains" a limited amount of information -
you can exhaust it.
That is information about the device. There is no suggestion at all
about some special property that would guarantee that the normal
read() system call has special behavior in connection with /dev/urandom.
There is no special documented API. Now that this misunderstanding
occurred I suppose a clarifying sentence will be added.
Nothing special with /dev/urandom.
Applications that make special assumptions are broken.
