Hi,
swsups works quite well for me, but there are some (minor) problems:
echo -n "disk" > /sys/power/state
Stopping tasks: =======================================|
Freeing memory: .............|
hdd: start_power_step(step: 0)
hdd: completing PM request, suspend
hdc: start_power_step(step: 0)
hdc: completing PM request, suspend
hdb: start_power_step(step: 0)
hdb: start_power_step(step: 1)
hdb: complete_power_step(step: 1, stat: 50, err: 0)
hdb: completing PM request, suspend
hda: start_power_step(step: 0)
hda: start_power_step(step: 1)
hda: complete_power_step(step: 1, stat: 50, err: 0)
hda: completing PM request, suspend
[disks are now off]
PM: Attempting to suspend to disk.
PM: snapshotting memory.
Now disks spin up and data is written to the swap partition (hdb2), then
the PC  powers off. The fact that  disks are stopped and  then restarted
seems a bit strange to me.
On resume I  see usual messages. hds  are on, then they  are powered off
and turned on again and then the system is restored. I see also a lot of
bad schedulings.
Another strange thing is that the shell dies:
note: bash[394] exited with preempt_count 1
this was  the shell  where I  typed the  suspend command  (echo blabla),
shells on other vc are alive.
I put dmesg (suspend + resume) here:
