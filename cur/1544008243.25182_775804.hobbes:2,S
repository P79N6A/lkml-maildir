Looks like I'm not going to be able to satisfy you then.  I didn't
introduce the names in the patch, so let's leave them as is for now,
and everybody can muse on what they should get called in the end.

Did I?  Whereabouts?  I wonder if you're thinking of the
+	page->flags &= ~PAGE_FLAGS_CHECK_AT_PREP;
in prep_new_page(), which replaces the clearing of another
collection of flags which somehow didn't get named before.
That clearing is a temporary measure, to keep the handling
of PageReserved unchanged in that patch; then it vanishes in the
next patch, where we treat all bad_page candidates the same way.

You mean one test_and_clear_bits() that somehow covers the different
cases of what we expect at free time and what we need at alloc time?
I don't think so.
