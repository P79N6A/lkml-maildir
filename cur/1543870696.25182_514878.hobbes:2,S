We certainly either need to embed try_to_freeze() into kthread_should_stop()
or add back the rcu_torture_fakewriter(), and rcu_torture_reader()
components of this patch.  ;-)
One way to embed try_to_freeze() into kthread_should_stop() might be
as follows:
	int kthread_should_stop(void)
	{
		if (kthread_stop_info.k == current)
			return 1;
		try_to_freeze();
		return 0;
	}
Does this seem reasonable?  It certainly would cut down some of the
code required for freezing -- and reduce the potential for bugs.
							Thanx, Paul
