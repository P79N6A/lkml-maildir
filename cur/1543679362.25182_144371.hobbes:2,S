i am doing some USB development these days and just managed to crash
khubd:
  kernel:  <6>note: khubd[9] exited with preempt_count 1
the system seems happy still, USB is not working anymore, though.
I have USB support built into the kernel, and a custom driver
written as a module.
Restarting would fix the problem and get USB back into operation,
but I am wondering if there is a way to restart the khubd kernel
thread manually. Is there?
I am soon going to switch to UML for this kind of development...
