Ok, sure, of course. I know that. However as 99% of the users won't be
reading enough manuals to do the hdparm -u1, it is still neccesary to
find out why the 128-byte-fifo-uart is losing characters, while the 
standard 16-byte-fifo-uart isn't. 
Turns out the trigger level on the new UART was set at 112. That's 16
before the end. Reducing the trigger level 32, fixed a lot, but still 
I was able to overrun the new uart at 19k2, while I couldn't overflow 
the 16550 at 115k2.
