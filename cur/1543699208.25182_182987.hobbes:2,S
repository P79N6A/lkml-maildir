Subject: ACPI Bug: 2.6.0-test11, Incomplete pci bus scan

Asus PR-DLS Dual Xeon (P4) motherboard
2.6.0-test11 kernel with acpi configured.
If I boot normally, the e1000 device is not recognised.
If I boot with pci=noacpi, the e1000 is recognised ( but e100/e1000 are 
assigned opposite ethx compared to 2.4)
lspci in both cases gives these devices
00:00.0 Host bridge: ServerWorks CMIC-LE (rev 13)
00:00.1 Host bridge: ServerWorks CMIC-LE
00:00.2 Host bridge: ServerWorks: Unknown device 0000
00:02.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corp. 82557/8/9 [Ethernet Pro 100] (rev 10)
00:03.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Rage XL (rev 27)
00:0f.0 ISA bridge: ServerWorks CSB5 South Bridge (rev 93)
00:0f.1 IDE interface: ServerWorks CSB5 IDE Controller (rev 93)
00:0f.3 Host bridge: ServerWorks GCLE Host Bridge
00:10.0 Host bridge: ServerWorks: Unknown device 0101 (rev 03)
00:10.2 Host bridge: ServerWorks: Unknown device 0101 (rev 03)
00:11.0 Host bridge: ServerWorks: Unknown device 0101 (rev 03)
00:11.2 Host bridge: ServerWorks: Unknown device 0101 (rev 03)
But these extra devices only appear when booting with pci=noacpi. Net access 
to a machine can also be arranged if it would help
02:04.0 SCSI storage controller: LSI Logic / Symbios Logic 53c1030 (rev 07)
02:04.1 SCSI storage controller: LSI Logic / Symbios Logic 53c1030 (rev 07)
03:02.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corp. 82544GC Gigabit Ethernet Controller 
(LOM) (rev 02)
If I can give any further info, let me know.
As a seperate issue, with pci=noacpi, both the net interfaces are recognised, 
but in reverse order to 2.4 kernel (eth0 <=> eth1)
