Woohoo! Just found out that ATA66 on the VIA aint too great.
I set the kernel boot options idebus=66 ide0=ata66 enabling ATA66
according to dmesg. The HDD is a WDC UDMA100 30.5GB drive. I retried the
dd if=/dev/hda7 of=/tmp/testing2.img bs=1024k count=2000 
on one VT, ran renice -20 on the dd process then ran procinfo on another
and top on a 3rd. I logged into a fourth and ran sync;sync;sync;sync;sync.
After @30 seconds the machine became totally unresponsive, locking up all
but the current VT.
I let it sit there and waited until the dd finished in case the renice was
what killed the control. When dd finished I tried running any type of
command but the tty was completely frozen. All other VTs were non
responsive as well.
This is gonna be fun when I test the Promise controller. hehe
