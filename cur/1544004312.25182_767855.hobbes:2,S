Then page migration will not occur because there is an unresolved
reference.

But there must still be reference for the bio and whatever may be going on
at the time in order to perform the I/O operation.

Have you actually seen corruption or this conjecture? AFACT the page
count is elevated while I/O is in progress and thus this is safe.
