Even when you're talking about the -rt tree, I suspect you really
shouldn't be using raw spinlocks, right? I mean, if you have a
timing critical operation, then you should ensure you have priorities
set correctly so that you simply don't get preempted.
By using a raw_spinlock_t, you're saying that you're more important
than anyone else (for the period of the critical section) including
processes which the user has explicitly set to a higher priority.
If you get preempted, then you should be happy, because <standard
RTOS nuclear power plant scenario> didn't occur.

This sort of raw_spinlock_t arms race throughout drivers/ would be
a huge reason not to move it into mainline.
