Right, but wrong reason ...
James admitted he thought the driver was otherwise SMP-safe; he didn't know
how to convert things from the old locking style to proper locking.
The problem with this code section is not the race between local
interrupts and the lock, since irqs are disabled before the cpu tries to
grab the lock.  The problem is that if the lock is grabbed by this code
path, and then the timer running on a different CPU attempts to acquire
the lock, it will spin.  del_timer_sync() will then spin waiting for
the timer to complete.  We're deadlocked.
