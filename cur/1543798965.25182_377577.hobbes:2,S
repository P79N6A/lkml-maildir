yeah, this is one of the open issues, and i have no strong preference 
for any of the naming variants. I considered two things when i went for 
the 'arch_semaphore' name:
1) the name should be temporary, and we could make it 'struct semaphore' 
   once the transition phase is over. Linus is totally correct 
   suggesting that there's nothing wrong about the 'struct semaphore' 
   name. It just happens to clash with my intended type-based 
   categorization of 'known counting semaphores' from 'unknown 
   semaphores'.
2) i wanted to signal that this is the per-arch semaphore 
   implementation.
another candidate name was 'struct __semaphore'. I like 'struct 
counting_semaphore' too, but maybe it's a bit too long as a name?  
Anyway, i'm very much open to suggestions how to name it best.
