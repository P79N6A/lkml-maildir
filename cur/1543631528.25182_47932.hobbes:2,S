This is an update to the treap-based bootmem patch. Very lightly tested
(UP i386 laptop with 256MB of RAM). As the patch is too lengthy to post
directly, I give only pointers to it. It features two new features:
(1) dynamic page stealing
(2) free_pages() of higher-order pages for bulk marking of free pages
	in the buddy allocator bitmap in free_all_bootmem_core().
and a cleanup:
(3) various cleanups including codesize reduction and elimination of
	dozens of include/asm-*/bootmem.h droppings around the tree.
Available from:
	bk://linux-wli.bkbits.net/bootmem/
	
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/wli/bootmem/bootmem-2.5.17-1
Remaining TODO items to follow up on are:
(1) The ability to mark memory as available at runtime but unusable for
	bootmem allocations. (rmk)
(2) Implement queries for automatic determination of ->node_start_paddr
	and ->node_low_pfn. (wli)
Cheers,
Bill
