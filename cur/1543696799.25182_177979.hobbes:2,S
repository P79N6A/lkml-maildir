With kernel 2.6.0-test9 running on both Fedora and Debian/unstable there is a 
problem with file handles.
It seems that the kernel somehow gets an open file handle for /dev/initctl (I 
still haven't determined how) and then passes it on to any processes it forks 
(IE modprobe and hotplug).
This shows up when running SE Linux as neither modprobe nor hotplug are 
permitted to access /dev/initctl in any way and the kernel message log 
records the access that was denied.
