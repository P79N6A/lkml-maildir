That's correct.

I did, but Pavel was travelling at that time (I think).

BTW it's i386-centric, as X86_GENERICARCH is not defined on x86_64, for
example.
FUrther, the whole problem, as far as I can understand it, is i386-specific,
so it should be resolved in the i386 architecture config rather than anywhere
else.
Greetings,
Rafael
