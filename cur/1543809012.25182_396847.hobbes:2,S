You don't have to worry. Simply check /proc/slabinfo, you'll see plenty
of memory used by dentry_cache and inode_cache and that's expected. This
memory will be reclaimed when needed (for instance by calls to malloc()).
If you don't believe me, simply allocate 1 GB in a process, then free it.

Willy
