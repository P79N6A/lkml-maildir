Subject: [PATCH] aic7xxx bouncing over 4G

I have an Adaptec AIC-7897 Ultra2 SCSI adapter on a system with 8G
of physical memory.  The adapter is using bounce buffers when DMA'ing
to memory >4G because of a bug in the aic7xxx driver. 
The problem is ahc_linux_get_memsize() returns an erroneous memory size 
(i.e., shifts out the high-order bits) for configurations >4G and the 
wrong dma mask is set by the caller.   The following patch fixes the problem 
by adding the needed cast.
