        I found the answer to my question (args a0-a5 are in registers,
then pt_regs magically appears on the stack).  
This is a checkpoint/restart system.  I need to port it from x86 to alpha.
So, I need to save the regs, and need to know what else to save.  I have
tried saving the switch_stack, and getting the usp (via rdusp()).  However,
when I restart the app, replace the struct pt_regs on the stack with the
regs from the image, as well as the switch_stack, and issue wrusp(), I
manage to set the pc someplace not within the app's stack.  I get a core
dump and gdb reports:
warning: Hit heuristic-fence-post without finding 
warning: enclosing function for address 0x200001930f4 
.  
.  
.  
Otherwise, you told GDB there
was a function where there isn't one...
So, I was wondering if I am missing something obvious?
