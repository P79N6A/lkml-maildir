It will be a while before I have time to try it, sorry.  SuSE 8.2 is
partially installed on that machine now and one day next weekend will
probably finish just that.

Stephen Hemminger sent private e-mail guessing that IPV6 bugs might be the
cause.  I did select a number of IPV6 options when building
2.6.0-test[1..5].  Sorry I don't remember if my 2.4.19 included any IPV6
support, and I'm not planning to try a regression test to that one.    I'll
try to find time some weekend to experiment with 2.6.0-test5 and
2.4.20-SuSE8.2 with and without IPV6.
I don't have access to IPV6 at present but figure I will someday, and if I
ever have time to experiment with it then the experimentation time will not
be wasted.  Most of the world (except for North America) will not be able to
survive without IPV6.
