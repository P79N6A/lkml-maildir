Yes, that works.
Making a scratch BFS slice, copying the files onto that
(maybe with tar if you want to preserve a directory tree)
and then mounting this slice under Linux would also be a way
of transporting files.
(Are there other common filesystems? dosfs, I suppose.
 Maybe also some variant of ufs?)
> I really wanted to transfer files from a vxfs file system
Yes. Implementing that is much more work than doing bfs.
