I'm not really a linux expert, so I can only be suspicious.
Masquerading of iptables 1.2.5 sudently idles when "iptables -L" shows 
everything is alright. A realoading of rc.firewall brings everything back to 
normal. That happened 7 days after a normal operation. I've now upgraded to 
1.2.6 and see what happens.
Also, crond doesn't seem to operate very precisely. It is sometimes seems 
idle for 30 minutes.
I know that these may be application-specific problems, but I was curious if 
there are any current kernel issues related to them so I can quit searching 
for another cure.
Thanks. Michael.
