I just checked my kswapd usage after seeing this note.  In -pre1 I had
been plagued by it.  Now, running -pre3 SMP on PIIs, I find kswapd is
a zombie.  It had used 1m14s of CPU compared to about 4s for kupdated
on an uptime of just under 65h.  I therefore presume it was still
hogging CPU...
More details available upon request.
