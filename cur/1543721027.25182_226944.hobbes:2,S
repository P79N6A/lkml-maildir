Ahh, ok, I myself have no experience with LSM, so there will likely be 
some
need to change my implementation.  Currently the only field that I add 
to
existing structures in the kernel is a pag field in the task_struct.  
PAG
structures themselves need some way of determining if the calling task
is in the same "grouping" as a stored "grouping" within the PAG.  My
implementation uses UIDs, but I would be very glad if you could tell me
what I should use instead.  I need some kind of structure or pointer 
that I
can embed within a PAG and a token, and some kind of equality test.
The other thing that needs to be implemented is some kind of limit that
restricts how many PAGs/tokens and how much memory can be allocated
in the kernel per user and per process.  Do you have any information on
where would be the best place to store that information?
Cheers,
