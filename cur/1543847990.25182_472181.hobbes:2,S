I haven't reviewed Paolo's patch yet, but with that in mind:
 - No, text is not deprecated yet. That is only possible when a simplified
   command-line tool is written and distributed (e.g. usbmon(8)).
 - No, I do not think an ioctl in debugfs or a text API is a good idea.
 - Resizing on text interface magnifies sprintf contribution to CPU burn,
   so once we have the binary one, there's only disadvantage and
   no advantage in implementing that.
