If any filesystem is holding any _global_ semaphores while waiting for
an I/O to complete - that's a major bug already.
Activity which may take a long time due to slow I/O on one filesystem
shouldn't block activity on other, unrelated filesystems, apart from
global resource competition such as numbers of dirty pages...
