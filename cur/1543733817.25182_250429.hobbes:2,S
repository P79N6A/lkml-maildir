Actually, the C standard
	  -- leaves unspecified whether bitfields start at the low or
	  high address of the word they're in, and
	  -- states that the type of a bitfield may be ignored (except
	  for signed/unsigned), and that the size of the object
	  containing a bitfield is the same as the size of an int.
It's a GCC extension that allows 
     __u8 ihl:4;
to allocate only 8 bits and use four of them; GCC still assumes
integer alignment for the whole bitfield block.  Other compilers could
allocate 32 bits.
