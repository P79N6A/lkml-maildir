Hi Daniel,
Sorry for not replying right away.

I've been actually tracking RT patches fairly closely. I can't say I tried all of them but I do try
them from time to time. I just got latest 2.6.24-rt1 running on HP xw9300. Looks like it does not handle
CPU hotplug very well, I manged to kill it by bringing cpu 1 off-line. So I cannot run any tests right 
now will run some tomorrow.
For now let me mention that I have a simple tests that sleeps for a millisecond, then does some bitbanging 
for 200 usec. It measures jitter caused by the periodic scheduler tick, IPIs and other kernel activities.
With high-res timers disabled on most of the machines I mentioned before it shows around 1-1.2usec worst case. 
With high-res timers enabled it shows 5-6usec. This is with 2.6.24 running on an isolated CPU. Forget about
using a user-space timer (nanosleep(), etc). Even scheduler tick itself is fairly heavy.
gettimeofday() call on that machine takes on average 2-3usec (not a vsyscall) and SW MAC is all about precise 
timing. That's why I said that it's not practical to use that stuff for me. I do not see anything in -rt kernel 
that would improve this.
This is btw not to say that -rt kernel is not useful for my app in general. We have a bunch of soft-RT threads
that talk to the MAC thread. Those would definitely benefit. I think cpu isolation + -rt would work beautifully
for wireless basestations.
