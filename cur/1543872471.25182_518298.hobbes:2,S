Given where the code originally came from, I've got bullets to dodge.

Impoliteness doesn't accomplish anything I want to do.

I'm more of a cooperative than competitive person, not to say that
flies well in Linux. There are more productive uses of time than having
everyone NIH'ing everyone else's code. If the result isn't so great,
I'd rather send them code or talk them about what needs to be done.

Decisions with respect to overall kernel design are made from well
above my level. Similarly with coding style, release management, code
directory hierarchy, nomenclature, and more. These things are Linus'
and devolved to those who go along with him on those fronts. If I
made those decisions, you might as well call it "wlix" not "Linux."

The extant versions of it fall well short of Linus' challenge as well
as my original goals for it. A useful exercise may also be enumerating
your expectations and having those who actually work with the code
describe how well those are actually met.
