Yeah, but it doesn't matter.  The system is no more useful running with a 
network card than it is rebooting itself.  Just make sure that it doesn't 
reboot itself more than N times in M hours, and you'll be fine...   The 
network admin needs to be paged in any case. The network card COULD be 
dead, in which case the administrator needs to replace it.  Otherwise, a 
reboot could solve the problem.
