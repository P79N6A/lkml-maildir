(I have read Eric's folloup to Linus' mail I'm replying to, but not
following that one up in AOL style. I second Eric mentioning the "curse
of the gifted" from own experience. You start something without design,
it succeeds for your talent, experience, whatever, it evolves and grows
and eventually disembogues into a rewrite from scratch, that time with a
design before the implementation.)

So, what does it boil down to? The need for an additional, well-defined
interface, encapsulating and hiding common functions. Effectively, once
the good interface is there, you will have an improved percentage of
shared code. That's what Eric is after, you wrap it up nicely into a
gift paper called interface.
Please: both of you, step back and hold a single second. You're not of
different opinions, basically.

That's what encapsulation and sharing that encapsulated code only via
its interface are all about.
