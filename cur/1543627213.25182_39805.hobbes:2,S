Hi all
                I need to copy some data from kernel memory space to user 
memory space. When I investigated, the command for that purpose is 
put_user_byte(). But in kernel2.4, I can't find the implementation of this 
command. I want to know the command which replaced put_user_byte() in 2.4 
kernel. Also I want to know whether there is any synonyms for verify_area() 
in kernel 2.4
regards
Blesson Paul
