Weeeellll....  If you want to go by the "if there is no listing in 
MAINTAINERS" rule, sure :)
Richard Henderson can be considered the current alphalinux kernel 
maintainer for 2.4.x and 2.5.x, though he gets help from Ivan Kokshaysky 
and Jay Estabrook, and a tiny bit of help from me too.
So at the very least, please make sure alpha kernel patches get CC'd to 
rth@twiddle.net and ink@jurassic.park.msu.ru.
