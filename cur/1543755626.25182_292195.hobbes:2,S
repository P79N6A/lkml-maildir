So instead let's do the work for them? We could perhaps put it in the
root prompt. Pray tell, what is the value to the user of exposing the
whole password, ever?

My perceived threat, as I've already stated, is that automated suite
of utilities like LVM or EVMS or even initscripts will silently store
this information in the clear on disk in an effort to make life
easier, oblivious to the fact that it might contain security-sensitive
information.
What drives this perception is that the output of "dmsetup tables"
invites it: it appears tailor-made to be fed into a future "dmsetup
create". Thus someone clever (but unaware of dm_crypt) _will_
eventually try this if it's not already happening. Further, there is
nothing in the dmsetup manpage to suggest that its output should be
guarded, etc. See "principle of least surprise."
Given the potential risk of naive use of dmsetup tables, what's the
upside again?
