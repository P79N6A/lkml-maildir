Looks like your system is NUMA, meaning that the system
memory is divided in half, and the threshold at which a
memory dirtying process is throttled might be higher than
the amount of memory available in the zone.
Can you reproduce this problem if you boot with "numa=off"
or if you "echo 20 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio" ?
