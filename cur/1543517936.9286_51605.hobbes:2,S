Upgrading from linux-2.2.14pre10 to linux-2.2.14pre11,
severe disk access stops any operation. If I wait about
ten minutes it restarts.
/var/log/messages has messages like:
	kernel: hdb: irq timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
Probing my log files this message was frequently left
since linux-2.2.14pre7 or around, but there was no
freeze.
Now I'm compiling linux-2.2.14pre11 with
ide.2.2.14-11.19991204.patch.bz2. I'm not sure it will
help me solve this problem...
My environment is as such:
	GA-586S2(SiS5582)
	Maxtor 84320D4(primary master, UDMA33)
	Maxtor 92040U6(primary slave, UDMA66)
	TEAC CD-532E-B(secondary master, 32x ATAPI CD-ROM)
	Acer CRW6206A(secondary slave, 2x ATAPI CD-R)
And Now I mainly use primary slave HDD.
/etc/rc.d/rc.local has such line as
	hdparm -c1 -m16 -X66 -k1 /dev/hdb
If I set
	hdparm -c1 -m16 -X65 -k1 /dev/hdb
There is no problem as I know now.
Is this trouble caused by my misconfiguration?
