I'll post traces privately. It was my lockups that got Rick
interested.

Would you explain what is accomplished by toggling the lock
every time through? What breaks by not doing so?

Not me, but see below.

If it's perfect why can't I use it without locking up the
machine? BTW, I'm currently running my patch. I can now
flood ping 100000 packets in either direction. With
unmodified tcp that is a red switcher (reliably hard locks
all i/o including the serial console).
