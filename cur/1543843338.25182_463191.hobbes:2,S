Reserving in advance means that sometimes you won't be able to start a
new group without taking back some of reserved pages. This is ... strange.
I think that a satisfactory solution now would be:
 - limit unreclaimable memory during mmap() against soft limit to prevent
   potential rejects during page faults;
 - reclaim memory in case of hitting hard limit;
 - guarantees are done via setting soft and hard limits as I've shown
before.
The question still open is wether or not to account fractions.
I propose to skip fractions for a while and try to charge the page to
it's first user.
So final BC design is:
1. three resources:
       - kernel memory
       - user unreclaimable memory
       - user reclaimable memory
2. unreclaimable memory is charged "in advance", reclaimable
   is charged "on demand" with reclamation if needed
3. each object (kernel one or user page) is charged to the
   first user
4. each resource controller declares it's own
       - meaning of "limit" parameter (percent/size/bandwidth/etc)
       - behaviour on changing limit (e.g. reclamation)
       - behaviour on hitting the limit (e.g. reclamation)
5. BC can be assigned to any task by pid (not just current)
   without recharging currently charged resources.
