Please read:

This explains, in simple terms, why you are just as right as you are
wrong.
Snippet:
-------------
Note, that I am not arguing that everything is rewritten in C++. There
are many large projects out there which are written in C - I do not
believe that it is a good idea to just "convert" them to C++. C++ allows
for cleaner solutions than C does, for a great many problems. Doing a
minimal conversion of a solution which is "as clean as it gets" in C, to
C++, would convert "good C" code into "poor C++". That is not a change
to the better!
-------------
And let's forget about this thread then please.
