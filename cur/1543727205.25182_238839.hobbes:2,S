If a new structure with anything but 'S' (0x53) in the first 4
bytes was chosen then the bsg driver could handle the new
structure and sg_io_hdr.
For example:
struct bsg_io_hdr {
     int8_t interface_id[4];   /* [i] 'B' in each element (required) */
     uint8_t dxfer_direction;
     .............
};
SCSI commands are all big endian and that seems to work
fine. Could pointers be passed as 8 byte big endian
unsigned integers?
