I am sorry to see that you did not look close enough...

Aha, so you like to state that MS-WIN is end-of-lifed?
Is this secret new information from Microsoft?
Solaris is not on this list, because the only way to send SCSI commands to any 
kind of SCSI target is by using my /dev/scg driver.
AIX is not on this list because the only way to send SCSI commands to any
target is by using the /dev/gsc driver from Mathew Jacob who is a former
Sun employee and who did get the idea for this driver from a talk with me 
during a visit at Sun in 1987.
FreeBSD is not on the list as it uses CAM, similar to BeOS (Zeta), 
OSF1 (True 64) and QNX.
IRIX is not on this list because it uses the same kind of interface as
e.g. HP-UX does
	snprintf(devname, sizeof (devname),
			"/dev/scsi/sc%dd%dl%d", busno, tgt, tlun);
Next try please....
