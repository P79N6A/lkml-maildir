I'm hoping it's not "ended".
IOW, I really don't think we _resolved_ anything, although the work that 
Adrian started is continuing through the wiki and other people trying to 
track regressions, and that was obviously something good.
But I don't think we really know where we want to take this thing in the 
long run. I think everybody wants a better bug-tracking system, but 
whether something that makes people satisfied can even be built is open. 
It sure doesn't seem to exist right now ;)
