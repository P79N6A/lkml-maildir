FYI, prior to this mod, XFS never clustered rewrites, so it's not surprising
that this particular issue has only recently come to light.

Well, that switches off rewrite clustering altogether, so it's
not surprising that it fixed your problem. It also points out the
problem as well - we don't every check if the buffer is dirty before
declaring that the page is acceptible for write clustering.
The other cases checked here (buffer_unwritten() and buffer_delay())
are, by defintition, dirty buffers and so they only ever cluster
dirty pages. buffer_mapped(), OTOH, could be clean or dirty.....
Can you try the patch below, and see if that fixes the problem
you are seeing?
Cheers,
Dave.
