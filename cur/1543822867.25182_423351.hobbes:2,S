->bd_disk _is_ pinned down.  However, it's not the problem - we keep
gendisk for as long as anyone uses it.  Which might be after the underlying
object is gone; that one is controlled by driver and driver calls
del_gendisk() when it decides that we are through.
The problem is with disk->driverfs_dev, not disk itself.  Block layer
has no fscking business touching it after del_gendisk() - if nothing else,
we might have _no_ underlying object at all from the very beginning.
So anything that wants events related to partitions, let alone mounting,
can't expect to see PHYSDEV... crap.  Moreover, it can bloody well
get to PHYSDEV... itself *if* it wants to and if it's there.  There's
a reason why we have that symlink in sys/block/<device> and userland can
bloody well access it on its own.
