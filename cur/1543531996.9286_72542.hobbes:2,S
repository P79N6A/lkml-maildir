	"malloc"?  You were talking kmalloc and the kernel reserving space
for its *internal* data structures.  Does the kernel mark address space
withing itself (kernel space) as 'available' but not actually claim a 
physical page to map it to?  I really really hope not.

	Reserved meaning removed from the 'free' pool -- that there is
a guaranteed space in the physical mem/swap pool (whther or not the mapping
has actually taken place).
