And NVidia southbridge, so OHCI not UHCI (plus EHCI) ... one experiment
would be to disable the EHCI (high speed USB) support in BIOS, to make
for a simpler hardware configuration, and see if that makes BIOS happier.
(Or better, just take EHCI out of your Linux config.)  Likewise, taking
the 8042 drivers out of Linux.
I wouldn't be surprised if those factors didn't matter, but it'd be good
to rule them out.

The "legacy" support in at least some cases involves BIOS having a
small USB stack -- enough to handle a keyboard or mouse in "boot mode"
(plus sometimes a USB disk or CDROM) -- and poking the i8042 chip to
act as if *IT* received the data bytes that really came over USB.
I sure don't know the ins-and-outs of such schemes (ISTR there are
others), but my guess is that either the 8042 or OHCI got confused,
at least in conjunction with the lowlevel magic ACPI was doing.
That's all black magic though, as far as I can understand it ...

What I'm curious about is exactly why the patch matters.  What ACPI
magic is being invoked to confuse, or unconfuse, those controllers?
