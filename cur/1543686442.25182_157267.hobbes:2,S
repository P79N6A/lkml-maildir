I have not been able to get PCMCIA support working in my TI-PCI1410 based
system using the 2.6.0-test3 kernel.  It works with 2.4.21, although I have
to do a "cardctl eject; cardctl insert" after the APM suspend/restore cycle. 
The main chipset is i830m and the laptop is a Dell C400, if that matters.
In 2.6.0-test3, the syslog shows these messages when inserting my Orinoco
card:
  Aug 10 15:55:33 venture cardmgr[312]: socket 0: Anonymous Memory
  Aug 10 15:55:33 venture cardmgr[312]: executing: 'modprobe memory_cs'
  Aug 10 15:55:33 venture cardmgr[312]: + FATAL: Module memory_cs not found.
  Aug 10 15:55:33 venture cardmgr[312]: modprobe exited with status 1
  Aug 10 15:55:33 venture cardmgr[312]: module /lib/modules/2.6.0-test3/pcmcia/memory_cs.o not available
  Aug 10 15:55:33 venture cardmgr[312]: bind 'memory_cs' to socket 0 failed : Invalid argument
Here's the (hopefully) relevant lspci output:
  00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corp. 82830 830 Chipset Host Bridge (rev 04)
  ...
  00:1e.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corp. 82801BAM/CAM PCI Bridge (rev 42)
  ...
  02:01.0 CardBus bridge: Texas Instruments PCI1410 PC card Cardbus Controller (rev 02)
This is from another laptop that works fine with both kernels:
  00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corp. 440BX/ZX/DX - 82443BX/ZX/DX Host bridge (rev 03)

  ...
I can provide more detailed information on request.
