Yes.

Almost every user of tty_ldisc_ref_* doesn't need to lock two objects
and
the code at that layer has no knowledge of pty/tty pairs. The needed
info is exposed however in order to do this since the tty knows if its a
tty/pty pair. I'll take a look - chances are it can be buried in
tty_ldisc_ref.
I'm dubious this is the actual bug although vhangup on a pty might
trigger it I guess.
