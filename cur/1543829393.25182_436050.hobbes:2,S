The system is configured for SMP, but this is an UP machine and the APIC
is disabled in the BIOS. Linux uses then the PIT and an IPI mechanism to
broadcast timer events. We need to do the event reprogramming per CPU,
so we switch off in that situation.
Solution: Either use an UP kernel, or enable Local APIC in the BIOS (is
not possible in most BIOSes), or add "lapic" to the kernel command line.
Also for an UP kernel adding "lapic" to the commandline is good, as the
APIC is faster accessible than the PIT.
