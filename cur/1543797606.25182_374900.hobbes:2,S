I don't see why that's any less usable than using udev from initramfs to find 
your root partition.
There is an interesting licensing issue, creating a linux kernel image that 
contains an initramfs that contains binary only firmware.  I can happily 
generate one here and not care, but does distributing such a kernel violate 
the GPL?
It's probable that the "early userspace" mechanism is a clearly defined API.  
We documented the heck out of the format, it cpio was already a standard 
anyway.  The binaries that are in there call the normal userspace API 
(syscall/ioctl/procfs etc) that is an established strong barrier to being a 
derived work.  So it's possible that putting those binaries in initramfs 
counts as "mere aggregation".  (If you had the kernel and the firmware in an 
ISO image, that's the same as being different files on the same CD, and 
definitely mere aggregation.  As separate files in the same tarball, it's 
closer but functionally equivalent and probably still just aggregation.  
Probably.  Different elf sections in the same binary is one more step, but 
depending on the intent the analogy could still hold...)
I can see distributors shying the heck away from it anyway, and wanting to 
keep things in _seperate_files_.  And I can entirely understand that.  This 
means if initramfs is going to contain firmware, the option of having it be a 
separate file like initrd for legal reasons is a darn good idea.
Query: if you tell lilo or grub that it has an initrd but feed it a gzipped 
cpio image, will the kernel figure everything out and initialize initramfs 
from that appropriately?

I do not think it means what you think it means.
