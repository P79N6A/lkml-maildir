Hi Alexey
Thanks for the response.  I'm reading up on packet.4 as well.
One more thing though: I noticed that with the old sockaddr_pkt structure,
we had the spkt_family, spkt_device and spkt_protocol components.
Please correct me if I'm wrong, but are:
	sll_hatype == spkt_family
	sll_protocol == spkt_protocol
?
One more thing: not documented in packet.4.  There's no equivalent of
char *spkt_device, but there is int ifindex.  I'm guessing but do you use
SIOCGIFNAME to obtain the interface name for this?  If not, what's the way
to obtain the device name itself given the interface index?  (eth0 for
example)
Thanks for the help.  Appreciated.
Gerard
