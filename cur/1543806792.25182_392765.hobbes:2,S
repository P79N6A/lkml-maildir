Also, if the machine has a floppy, boot DOS. Write the above snippit
of code using DOS debug. Step through it. Watch what register(s) get
written...
A>debug
- a100
- mov ax,6f02
- mov bl, ff
- int 15
- int 3
rip 100
- t ; trace the steps.
Once the timer gets written, the machine will reboot when it
times-out. Therefore use a large timeout value as above 0xff.
Cheers,
