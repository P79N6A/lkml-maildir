It's optional.
I -STILL- can't figure out why the autoprober doesn't just look in 
/proc/mounts to figure out who and what our root device and filesystem are.
I need to set up a system that boots to an initrd and puts the root device 
lives on a samba server just to confuse eric's autoprober.  Hmmm...  I wonder 
if that would work? :)
