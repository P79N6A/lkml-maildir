Statelessness translated to capacity back in the day when maintaining state
for hundreds or thousands of machines was expensive...
I don't buy NFS as an excuse, though. I refuse to believe that a
shared /dev is necessary or desirable for *any* environment. /dev/pts
is one example of where everybody seems to have already agreed on
this.
With udev, or with devfs, a shared /dev becomes unnecessary. /dev will
no longer need to be 7000+ entries. It could be a few hundred or less
for common configurations, and 0% persistence/remote storage for
tmpfs-udev or devfs.
There are a few cases that we might be forced to maintain regular
numbers: mkfifo() creates a named pipe, and bind() creates a named
socket. These might be accessed between reboots over NFS, or local
mounts by many existing programs. I think these must be guaranteed to
keep the same major:minor numbers across reboots (preferably, even
across kernel releases). These are exceptional cases, though, and
should be considered as such.
Cheers,
mark
