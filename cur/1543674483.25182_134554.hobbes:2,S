Well using the APIC arbitration round robin thing isn't all that smart 
either unless you use the TPR, so TPR would be a win everywhere.

Word... This is all rather tired, if we have a working irq affinity user 
accessible interface this can all go away, so how about we just work 
towards that means, and then remove kirqd when everyone is happy 
(personally i like Arjan's/RH9 userland irqbalance).
