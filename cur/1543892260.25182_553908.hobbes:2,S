Yeah, this caused test.kernel.org to fail as well.
There are a couple of fixes in
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.22-rc4/2.6.22-rc4-mm1/hot-fixes/
which should get things going again.
Robert, I spent some time picking at
mmconfig-validate-against-acpi-motherboard-resources.patch then got bored
with fiddling with it and reverted it outright.
Please, we need to get those prototypes of pci_mmcfg_early_init() and
pci_mmcfg_late_init() into some sane place which works on all
architectures, not duplicate one of them in a C file and even see if we can
avoid the #ifdef CONFIG_PCI_MMCONFIG in arch/i386/pci/init.c
This code area is really messy, due partly to the x86_64 and i386 sharing. 
Any changes in there need careful testing and checking.
