That may do the trick as the read can't cross the spin_lock (it can
cross spin_unlock but not lock). Advantage over adding a barrier to
handle_IRQ_event() is that it keeps the overhead to the slow path
(synchronize_irq).
Note that I didn't actually experience a problem here. I just came upon
that by accident while thinking about a similar issue I have with
napi_synchronize().
Looks good to me on a first glance (unfortunately a bit ugly but heh).
Ben.
