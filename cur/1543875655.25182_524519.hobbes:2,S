Yes, although in testing it detects BM activity more often then one
might think, I agree, this is probably too aggressive.  At the time, I
was trying to avoid situations where BM_STS goes high early during a
long busy period and as a result becomes stale.

Yes, but do we need to support BM_STS in the SMP case?

I ignore the time between idle states because I'm only interested in
accounting the idle sleep behavior.  A more sophisticated strategy might
also account the running time between idles in some way.  However, it is
worth noting that a busy system has the indirect effect of shortening
the idle residency times. 
I think removing the BM_STS clear attempt at the beginning should help
to reset bm_elapsed_us after sufficiently long busy periods.
