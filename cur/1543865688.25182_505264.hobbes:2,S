More importantly, some things that *are* visible probably shouldn't be, or 
should perhaps only be in expert mode (aka "EMBEDDED").
A prime example of this is all the firewall settings. I'd personally 
prefer to just select a "default firewall setup" which would be enough 
for all the normal crud, instead of seeing 50 different choices. 
And dammit, I'm supposed to be "technical". So if _I_ find it irritating 
to have to select all those NF_MATCH_xxx/NF_TARGET_xxx crud things, 
imagine what most people must feel like?
Me, I'd like to say I want "default firewall built in", and not have to 
see *any* of the crap. And that's exactly why "select" is a good thing.
Not using select, and have people having to say "y" to the basic feature 
and then y/m/n to each sub-feature is really damn annoying.
So thank God for the few selects we have, and we should add a whole lot 
more!
