But in the case where there _aren't_ any functions which could usefully be 
shared between the modules, you've got a whole extra gratuitous module 
(What's that, 32KiB on some ARM boxen?) just to hold the registration 
functions, which aren't needed if you just use get_module_symbol().
Provide generic code for registering such stuff and it might be acceptable. 
Otherwise, get_module_symbol is better. There's no fundamental flaw with 
get_module_symbol() - just one or two of the current usages of it.
