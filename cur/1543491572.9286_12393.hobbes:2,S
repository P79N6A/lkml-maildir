By mistake, I've just run ipmasqadm with portfw and forward packets to port
80 on machineA into port 80 on machineA. It's wrong, I know, but that was a
error. Trying to access port 80 on that machine does reboot the machine.
First of all, I think ipmasqadm shouldn't allow you to insert that rule
(IMHO).
But even if it does, it was supposed the reboot to happen ?
Running 2.2.3 on i586.
Haven't tried it with any other kernel version.
