To be like the UNIXes.

Anton proposed raising the limits last autumn, but I was a bit
discouraging back then, having noticed that even Solaris 9 was more
restrictive than Linux.  They seem to be ancient traditional limits
which everyone knows must be raised to get real work done.
It's possible that if we raise the limits, installation
of this or that application will then lower them again?
I don't think my opinion is worth much on this:
what would the distro tuners like to see there?
