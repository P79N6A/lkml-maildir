I've tested both with and without CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED on, both fail the same way.
hald reports that the device has no parent and decides to ignore it.
I've also tested both combinations against hal from ubuntu 6.06LTS and a more recent version
brad@bklaptop2:~$ hald --version
HAL package version: 0.5.8.1
Again with and without CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED and all combinations fail.
Hal appears to go looking for /sys/block/mmcblk0/mmcblk0p1/range
When it can't find it, it then looks for the parent of that to check what would be 
/sys/block/mmcblk0/range, Complains it can't find a parent for /sys/block/mmcblk0/mmcblk0p1 and just 
proceeds to ignore the event.
