Hi,
 This is to announce that version 2.0 of DIPC (
http://wallybox.cei.net/dipc
) 
for Linux is available now. DIPC can be used to build and program clusters 
(multi-computers) very easily, and provides distributed program developers 
with semaphores, messages and Transparent Distributed Shared Memory (DSM).
 The following are some of the features in DIPC 2.0:
 *) In addition to i386 and m68k, it now supports PowerPC, MIPS, Alpha and 
    SPARC processors.
 *) There is a considerable speed increase in DIPC's Distributed 
    Shared Memory operations.
 *) The code is SMP-friendly.
 *) Compiles under glibc 2.1 and libc.
 *) Is easily usable on clusters with diskless machines.
 *) DIPC Is GPL, so you can do any modifications you may like, for example
    to adapt it to any custom distributed programming hardware you may have.
 The file dipc-2.0.tgz, containing the complete source code and documents, 
can be obtained by anomymous FTP from wallybox.cei.net, in directory 
/pub/dipc. Alternatively, it can be downloaded from sunsite.unc.edu, in 
/pub/Linux/system/network/distrib.
 Here is DIPC's LSM file:

Title:		DIPC (Distributed Inter-Process Communication)
Version:	2.0
Entered-date:	20SEP99
Description:	DIPC enables you to build and program distributed 
                (multi-computer) systems very easily. It works by 
                making System V IPC mechanisms (shared memories, 
                semaphores and messages) network transparent.
Keywords:	distributed parallel programming multi computer cluster
