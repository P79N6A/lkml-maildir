The whole point of the LINUX32 personality is to mangle the output of
uname, it doesn't do anything else on the architectures I have worked 
with (s390, x86_64 and ppc64).
Even with the patch, the normal operation would be to use PER_LINUX
for everything, so the kernel build works as expected unless you pass
the obsolete "fakeppc" boot parameter.
With the LINUX32 personality, you can build 32 bit binaries through
autoconf, rpmbuild, or the kernel without pretending to be
cross-compiling. It may not be the best solution, but people seem to
rely on it and the patch brings ppc64 in line with how it works on
the other architectures.
