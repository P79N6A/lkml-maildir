I think that's it.  The media tree was done with options to select the core
system module, then a menuconfig that depended on that which the drivers
were under.

How about these examples:
menuconfig FOO
if FOO
config A
	depends on FOO
endif
config B
if FOO
config C
	depends on FOO
endif
Or this:
menu FOO
menuconfig BAR
config A
menuconfig BAZ
config B
endmenu
How does it show the first one, keeping the config entries in the correct
order and put them into the menu at the same time?
And which of what should the second be show?
foo
\-bar
  \-baz
or
foo
|-bar
\-baz
There is no question with menus, as the menu tree is clearly lexically
defined by the matching menu / endmenu pairs.  But menuconfig doesn't work
that way, and it seems like it would make more sense if it did.
