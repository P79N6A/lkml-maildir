Hi,
Supposing I have an external kernel module which I would like to compile against 
both original kernel and -rt kernel, what is the proper/most elegant way to know 
which kernel I'm compiling with ?
I've only found the EXTRAVERSION define, am I missing a better way ?
In fact, I'm facing the problem of HRTIMER_ABS/REL being renamed to 
HRTIMER_MODE_ABS/REL with patch -rt. Is there a reason of this ?
Does anyone have an objection of keeping it the same (let's say 
HRTIMER_ABS/REL) in kernel -rt ?
Thanks,
