Even your piix driver supports PATA. Put the foaming (justified ;))
hatred for ACPI aside for a moment and take a look at the real world as
it unfortunately is right now.

You don't know what the sequences the resume method is concerned about
actually are.

Only on some systems.

Sure, but sometimes the *wrong* defined state. The BIOS ACPI methods
include things like unlocking drive passwords on restore with some
systems. You don't handle that at all.
Having said that I still think ACPI awareness doesn't belong in libata
or scsi because we'd then have awareness of every pm scheme in the wrong
layer and a dozen pm systems all with scsi hooks. Gak...
SCSI/libata can go easily from ata channel to pci device to device. The
rest of the logic belongs outside of scsi/libata.
