Zeus uses it! (it was HP who added it to HP-UX first at our request :-)

It's a very useful system call and makes file serving much more
scalable, and I'm glad that most Un*xes now have support for it
(Linux, FreeBSD, HP-UX, AIX, Tru64). The next cool feature to add to
Linux is sendpath(), which does the open() before the sendfile()
all combined into one system call.
Ugh, I hear you all scream :-)
Jon.
