This slab poisoning pattern change is not very important.
Because even if slab debugging is enalbed, kref_put() with unreferenced
kref object will be detected as slab corruption.
Because kref_put() decrements the kref counter in freed slab object.
Slab corruption: start=e0e8b698, len=32
Redzone: 0x5a2cf071/0x5a2cf071.

The main reason I want to propose this kref debugging is because
I can find many places where we can replace from atomic_t to
struct kref by doing "grep -r atomic_dec_and_test .".
But I warried that replacing by kref will just increase atomic operations
because of debugging code in kref (WARN_ON()es in kref.c)
So patch 4/4 is not very important, I want to drop patch 4/4.
