I like to write applications as shell scripts myself - indeed, one
regularly used shell-script of mine is a database lookup system, and
is written entirely as a bash script...
Personally, I see nothing wrong with the addition of a few small,
strategically placed C programs to provide needed functionality that's
not available from the relevant shell. As an example, in one shell
script I wrote recently, I needed at one point to calculate the common
logarythm of a number, and was unable to find any way to do this from
bash itself, so I wrote a short C program that does that, then called
it from the relevant points within the script.
However, even that's not needed in this case, as it can be done
entirely within bash. Try the following:
 Q> #!/bin/bash
 Q> function spam() {
 Q>     while [ -z '' ]; do
 Q>         echo -n "$* "
 Q>     done
 Q> }
 Q> spam This is a test > /tmp/stupidity
That does exactly what my previous C-based example did, and uses
nothing that isn't part of bash itself. As a result, assuming that
bash is present, it will work...

How does that paragraph relate to the rest of your post? I can't see
any relationship between them...
Taking the paragraph on its own, I can confirm that the serial
console, initrd and romfs all find regular use here, although I have
to admit that I regard /dev/nvram as something that would be much
better omitted...
Best wishes from Riley.
