you seem not to know all rules about the atomic operations in smp, you
cannot just set_bit on one side and use non-atomic operations on the
other side, and expect the set_bit not to invalidate the non-atomic
operations.
The effect of the mprotect may be deleted by your new concurrent
set_bit and stuff like that.

exactly, this also avoids the more complex (and racy, but the racy would
be easy to fix by adding another 4 atomic bytes to the vma) double
locking that you introduced.

you can still fix the smp race condition by trivially adding 4 bytes to
the vma (i.e. a vma->vm_flags_atomic), but I'd be surprised if your
double locking actually improve things, Martin is running on a very
parallel old-numa where cacheline bouncing across nodes pass through a
fibre channel IIRC, and the cacheline bouncing that the semaphore
generates is huge, it's not necessairly huge contention, it's just the
bouncing that hurts, and the down_read won't help at all for the
cacheline trashing, it'll still bounce like before. Though you may gain
something minor, but I doubt it'd be huge.
I'd suggest Martin to give a try to the racy code, it's just good enough
for a pratical experiment (the race shouldn't easily trigger so it
probably passes one run of SDET safely).
