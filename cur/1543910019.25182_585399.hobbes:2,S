Doing this in-kernel would violate the separation of policy and 
mechanism.  There's nothing wrong with providing the hooks necessary for 
userspace to do this, but it's generally userspace's responsibility to 
decide what should be done when a possible problem is detected.  I'm 
aware of software that does predictive migration with mdadm when smartd 
detects a problem.  Getting this into users' hands is a distro/vendor 
problem, not a kernel development problem.
That said, if you can think of some additional hooks that would really 
be beneficial to userspace monitoring tools, by all means send in patches.
