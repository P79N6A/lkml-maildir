And what if you don't have enough virtual space to fit all the memory you
need, plus the holes?  Config_nonlinear handles that, config_discontig
doesn't.

First that's wrong.  Look at _alloc_pages and tell me that config_discontig
doesn't impact the common code (in fact, it adds two extra subroutine
calls, including two loops, to every alloc_pages call).
Secondly, config_nonlinear does not clobber the common code.  If it does,
please show me where.
When config_nonlinear is not enabled, suitable stubs are provided to make it
transparent.

So you're proposing a new patch?  Have you chosen a name for it?  How
about 'config_nonlinear'? ;-)
