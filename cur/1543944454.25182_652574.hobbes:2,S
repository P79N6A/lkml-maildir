Well there's a case in point.  rcupdate.h is not a part of networking, and
it is random tree-wandering like this which causes me problems and which
will cause Stephen problems.
Now, I don't know which tree "owns" rcupdate.h but it ain't networking. 
Probably git-sched.
Nothing in networking depends upon that change (which has a typo in the
comment, btw) hence it can and should have gone through
whichever-tree-owns-that-file.
For Stephen's sake: please.
