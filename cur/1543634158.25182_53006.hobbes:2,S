Subject: 2.5.22 problems with compile.h

I really need some help with compiling version 2.5.22
>From a clean install, I can compile, but I get an error with compile.h (Do
not know how to make compile.h). If I compile again, I get a working kernel
(bzImage), "depmod -ae -F xx " works like a charm. But, when I reboot with
the new kernel, I can not load any modules. None, they all have symbol
problems.
I use grub for loading, and I have verified that I have the correct
System.map
My last kernel is 2.5.19, which works like a charm ( well... ).
To compile a kernel, I use "make dep clean bzImage modules modules_install",
except for the first compile after an upgrade where I run "make oldconfig"
first.
Thanks,
Hans E.
