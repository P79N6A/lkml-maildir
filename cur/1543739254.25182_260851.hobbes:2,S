You have a application running which uses the framebuffer device, then
suspend with that app running.  You'll have to restore the state of
the device _before_ restarting all the userspace proccesses, otherwise
the app will not be very happy.  I'm not sure if the kernel can run a
userspace helper in that situation (i.e. before waking all the
processes).
