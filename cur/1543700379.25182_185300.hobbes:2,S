Most probably, yes. That will cause the program to give up its entire
timeslice, so then all processes of any priority will be able to use
their entire timeslices before it.
If it gets called often, that would be the cause of your problem. Try
just using the usleep. You could even reduce the usleep timeout to
1000 or so, which 2.6 can take advantage of.
