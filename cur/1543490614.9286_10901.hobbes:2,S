Why not? The Elite 47 is a BIG modern (ok, late 1997) 5.25" drive.
Heck, the newer Barracuda 50 puts *22* heads in a 1.6" 3.5" drive... The
Elite 47 is a 3.25" high 5.25" drive that isn't THAT much older...

Some quick checking on Seagate's web-pages[1] gives 9996 cylinders, 28
heads and an AVERAGE of 328 sectors per track. All this is verbatim
from their specification.
(And besides it's easy to verify, the figures checks with the required
number of sectors, which also are listed). 
91923356 / 9996 / 28 = 328.43
