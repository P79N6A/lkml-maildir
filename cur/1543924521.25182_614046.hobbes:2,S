It's ready for testing. Please grab
http://ltt.polymtl.ca/lttng/patch-2.6.24-rc1-git13-lttng-0.10-pre18.tar.bz2
patch name :
markers-support-multiple-probes.patch
It still need to go through patchcheck.pl and some polishing, but it
seems to work fine for me with multiple probes (the sample marker,
sample probe and multiple instances of my lttng probes can
connect/disconnect without problem).
Currently, the "connect/disconnect" and "arm/disarm" operations are
separate. However, they could be merged. Any comment/preference on this?
Being separate, a probe provider can wait until the very last moment
before it activates its markers, with a minimalistic impact on the
system, but it is not such a strong argument.
