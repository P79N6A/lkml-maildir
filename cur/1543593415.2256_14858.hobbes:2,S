What about 3com homefree camera [or is it homeconnect?]?
It is usb and unsupported; however
figuring it out should not be that hard. [It is usb, after all.]
Another device worth linux driver is lucent winmodem: it already has
userspace driver [see linmodems.org], and "telephony" version of
that driver would be nice.
