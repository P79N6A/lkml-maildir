Hello!
There is a problem with the IDE-SCSI Emulation since Kernel 2.3.48 with
PD/CD-ROM Drive(s).
On my TEAC PD-1 PD-518E is since 2.3.48 and up only detection of the CD-ROM
Device, but none detection of the PhaseChange Device (Optical Device).
Is that a problem of IDE-SCSI Emulation or IDE-Base Driver?
