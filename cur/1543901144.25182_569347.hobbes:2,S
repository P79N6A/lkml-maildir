no, this needs to be done by the main kernel, becouse only it knows how to 
find this info. the kernel that you kexec into could be very different 
(including different versions) and the ways to identify this data is not 
part of any existing API

you should though.
by doing this write in usespace you can add in all the eye-candy (aka 
progress bars), network I/O, etc that you want since it doesn't affect 
things
trying to do this in the kernel makes the kernel have to know/decide too 
much policy (and many things that people want to do are things that do not 
belong in the kernel in the first place)

the kexec process should handle the device state for the transition from 
one kernel to another (it has to do this now, this isn't a new 
requirement), so this should solve the problem during the hibernate stage.
during the wakeup stage, I thought you said that al that was needed was to 
feed the suspend image to /dev/suspend and the kernel in the suspend image 
would re-probe, or otherwise re-initialize all the devices it needs. am I 
misunderstanding this?
