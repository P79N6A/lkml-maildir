Look at the "deb" target for how this was fixed for building Debian
(-style) packages.
Specifically, you want to change:
	$(MAKE)
to
	$(MAKE) KBUILD_SRC=
At a glance, I don't see a similar problem in the binrpm-pkg target, and
I don't understand the rpm target at all, so those may have other
issues.
I am, however, looking at 2.6.15-rc{something}, not 2.6.13, but I think
it's been a while since Sam sent the deb packages fixes upstream.
