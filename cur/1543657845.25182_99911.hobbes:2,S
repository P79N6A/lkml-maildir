That's the better solution, I'm trying to coordinate a bit with the 
maintainer. The only reason I didn't do this in the first place is because 
there is a (possibly unecessary) delay loop inside hermes_bap_seek that I 
believe is trying to combat the same problem. I'm awaiting a response from 
the maintainer since he knows a bit more about the hardware than I do.
