Well it does fill a gap: something which presents a higher-level interface
to netlink capabilities.  There are several places in the kernel which do
open-coded hand-rolled netlink communications, so regularisation and
consolidation is a good thing there, if it's possible.
But the current connector implementation does that in an unpopular manner,
so we're a bit stuck.
