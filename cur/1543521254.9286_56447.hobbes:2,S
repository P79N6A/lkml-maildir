I rewrote ps. Properties of a good solution might be:
1. single system call returns an array
2. all values are 64-bit (larger values can be split)
3. binary data
4. reasonable choice over what data is returned
Of course, ps must use the Linux kernel 2.2.x /proc for a while.

You can use minimal.c to get a library-free 8 kB ps.

It is not reasonable to get such a snapshot. If every process has
a full comand line and you have 32767 processes, you need over 4 GB.
Actually, that means ps is automatically broken on 32-bit systems.
