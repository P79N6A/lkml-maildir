Hi,
AFAICS the -ac tree should be the most stable of all kernels, right?
-mm is totally bleeding edge
-bk the same
-ck is experimental
Others are experimental too.
Looking at the changelogs, the most reasonable kernel to use for
generic use are the -ac kernels, which I am going to use since 2.6.10
as long as Alan is kindly going to continue his fabulous work.
I swear not to use 2.6.10 until Alan publishes 2.6.10-ac1 :-)
Regards,
Maciej
