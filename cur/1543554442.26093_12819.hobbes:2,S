This might also be a good idea; but my suggestion is to not allow arbitrary
strings as module names in the first place. As far as I can see, all valid
strings for KMOD requests consist of alphanumeric chars plus dash and
underscore. Anybody with autoloaded modules that don't fit this pattern even
after /etc/modules.conf translation please object !
Here's the patch...
