Well it looks like modem_run is giving you problems. If you want you could do 
without it and  let the kernel load the firmware itself. To try this you will 
need to  prepare the firmware by splitting it into two parts To do that you'll 
need a copy of the speedtouch-1.3.1 driver
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/speedtouch/speedtouch-1.3.1.tar.gz?download
untar it and cd into the speedtouch-1.3.1/src folder and then enter
gcc -o firmware firmware.c -DSTANDALONE_EXTRACTER
That will compile a binary called firmware. You can use that to split  the 
modems firmware into two parts. If (for example) the firmware is  called mgmt.o, 
copy it into the speedtouch-1.3.1/src folder and then enter
./firmware mgmt.o
mv boot.bin speedtch-1
mv firmware.bin speedtch-2
That will create two files, boot.bin and firmware.bin. Rename boot.bin  -> 
speedtch-1 and firmware.bin -> speedtch-2. Then you need to copy  these two 
speedtch files into hotplugs firmware folder. You can find  this by reading 
/etc/hotplug/firmware.agent
cat /etc/hotplug/firmware.agent | grep FIRMWARE_DIR=
Make sure you enabled hotplug firmware loading in your kernel config
CONFIG_FW_LOADER=y
and check that hotplug has this line in /etc/hotplug/usb.usermap
speedtouch 0x0003 0x06b9 0x4061 0x0000 0x0000 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00  0x00 
0x00000000
