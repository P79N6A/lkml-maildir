Why?
This only clutters up the compile, hiding real errors.
I think all those compile warnings are totally bogus. Who really cares? 
Are they going to be fixed, or were they added just to irritate people?
We should have a strict rule: anybody who adds things like "must_check"
and "deprecated" had better also be ready and willing to fix all the new
warnings they cause - you're not allowed to just assume that "somebody
else will fix it".
