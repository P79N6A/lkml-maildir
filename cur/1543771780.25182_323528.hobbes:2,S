Subject: [PATCH 4/5] UML - Fix strace -f
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

It turns out that we need to check for pending signals when a newly forked 
process is run for the first time.  With strace -f, strace needs to know
about the forked process before it gets going.  If it doesn't, then it
ptraces some bogus values into its registers, and the process segfaults.
So, I added calls to interrupt_end, which does that, plus checks for 
reschedules.  There shouldn't be any of those, but x86 does the same thing,
so I'm copying that behavior to be safe.
