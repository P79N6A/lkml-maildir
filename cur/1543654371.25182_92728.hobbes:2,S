[Hypocrisy alert: I'm feeling somewhat lazy right now so there could be
more grammar problems with this e-mail than with the file it's trying
to improve. OTOH this e-mail isn't distributed with every Linux kernel
source code tarball.]

Again, s/compiler/library/ (i.e., undo your change, it was right the
first time)

Can the kernel still freeze during printk if it was compiled for the
wrong CPU type, or has that been fixed? (I haven't followed that closely
enough.)

Not a criticism of your patch, but something I just noticed now -- feel
free to ignore this: that comma after "(egcs-1.1.2)" seems awkward to me.

Conversely, this is better with the comma (IMO).

Something seems wrong to me about this sentence. The easiest potential
fix I can think of is s/contains/describes/, but that might not be a
100% fix. My problem with this sentence is that it seems to be saying
the file:
+ "contains a suggested format for bug reports"
+ "contains...what information is most helpful to developers"
I know what you mean by the latter, but if I interpret it in a slightly
more literal sense, it seems both semantically and syntactically flawed.

Should this mention the mailing list's e-mail address?

You (accidentally?) removed the period.

Perhaps s/explain/tell us/ ?
