drivers/char/esp.c: In function 'rs_stop':
drivers/char/esp.c:213: error: 'struct esp_struct' has no member named 'lock'
drivers/char/esp.c:219: error: 'struct esp_struct' has no member named 'lock'
drivers/char/esp.c: In function 'rs_start':
drivers/char/esp.c:230: error: 'struct esp_struct' has no member named 'lock'

Obvious "fix" is to revert the changes to esp.c code.
