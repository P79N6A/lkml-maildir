Because a BUG_ON panics and then spin for ever. Yeah I shoud have said "panic",
sorry... It was just to tell that a BUG_ON is the end...

You want to say spin forever?
Why would it? cwq->lock is unlocked at this time.
If we keep the usual path:
if (cwq->thread == current) {
		run_workqueue(cwq);
		active = 1;
	}
it shouldn't hurt.

I don't think so IMHO, BUG_ON is for critical issues. Here it is not
critical, the workqueue
will flush but lockdep will warn because of recursion.
That's all.
