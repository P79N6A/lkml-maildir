The current code for discovering the zone sizes and holes is sometimes 
very hairy despite there being some similaries in each arch. This patch 
kit will eliminiate some of the uglier code and have one place where zones 
and holes can be sized. To me, that is a good idea once the bugs are 
rattled out.
On a related note, parts of the current zone-based anti-fragmentation 
implementation are an architecture-specific mess because changing how 
zones are sized is tricky with the current code. With this patch kit, 
sizing zones for easily reclaimable pages is relatively straight-forward.
