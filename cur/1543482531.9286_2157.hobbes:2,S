My air conditioning costs are zero.  I open a window and cold air
comes in.  Nuff said...
My 486 is acting as a firewall/gateway right now, with 8M of RAM.
It is getting downgraded to a 386 with 8M simply because it is
just too damned fast.
386/486 computers *ARE* useful, it just VERY MUCH depends on who
you are, and what your USES are.  Price isn't a concern IMHO.
