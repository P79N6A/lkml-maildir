AFAIK, the option to compile w/o APIC is only for UP systems.  If you
want to use both of your processors, you have to compile in APIC
support, but just disable it when loading the kernel (ie. for lilo,
'append="noapic"')

That would explain why it works for me.  Now, if only I didn't have
devices that need to have their BIOSes upgraded via a Windows .exe...
