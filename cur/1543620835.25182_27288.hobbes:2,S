   I hope you don't consider this a good argument to force all the other
   platforms to throw away their perfectly good low-core code.
I didn't have to change any of my locore code, what the heck
are you talking about? :-)  All of the changes to _ANY_ assembly
on sparc64 looked like this:
-	lduw	[%g6 + AOFF_task_thread + AOFF_thread_flags], %l0
+	lduw	[%g6 + TI_FLAGS], %l0
It actually cleaned up my locore code :-)
I think, in fact, the everything people have right now in
thread_struct should move to thread_info and we should kill
off thread_struct entirely.  It has no reason to exist anymore.
