declare removed, printf can be a sh-util file as well as a bash built in 
so I'm not concerned with that.

What is the full output of your loadkeys program with --junkoption?  I 
avoided using combinations of programs and chose to concentrate on 
implementing a one program only solution which was common through the 
script.
loadkeys is part of the kbd/console-tools mess.  It can report a 
version, not report a version, use --version or -V depending on what 
package or date in history your package comes from.

Unfortunately this would evolve into a big pile of versions and offsets 
that nobody would want to touch with a 10' pole.

One doesn't, it's a generic list that makes some assumptions.  To this 
end, I've decided to add some /proc checking before searching for 
certain tool versions.

One of the most visible points in history is pppd, for a long while it 
seemed like the most frequently recurring bug post was why pppd didn't 
work. The version the bug reporter had was less than required.

I've just added checking to a few of the version searches that takes 
note from /proc files as to whether or not said support is loaded and 
running.  In other words it doesn't make to much sense to check for pppd 
if the user doesn't use pppd.  Note that this can certainly be 
misconstrued and I should put a --verbose, or perhaps trying to be smart 
here will just make matters worse.

It is mentioned in the top level REPORTING-BUGS file.

It helps to clean up  some ambiguities when a bug report comes in.

I've updated it a few times since you've last retrieved it.

Personally I dislike perl ['s bubblegum fixes everything approach], I 
don't think it's worth it to make such a heavy requirement of a user. 
 The hang has been removed by adding the --junkoption, and as far as I 
know none of the given version checks should hang now.

Actually, on four of my seven systems I don't have 'fdformat' so 
'util-linux' would have failed, but I -do- have 'mount' which is part of 
the same package.

Agreed, some people use less, some people more.

The only problem with patching tools like this, is that it often doesn't 
get back to the author or doesn't get implemented by the author, much 
less it doesn't fix earlier versions of the same software.

Ugg, don't get me started.  "pppd --version"  means I want the version. 
 I don't give a flying fsck whether the kernel supports it or not, and I 
don't give a flying fsck if I have a messed up options file.  I want the 
version, nothing more, nothing less. What's worse, there isn't a textual 
string for the version in the binary that I can grab.
