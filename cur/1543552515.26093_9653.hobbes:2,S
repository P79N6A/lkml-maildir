Hello,
lock_kernel() is a reentrant spinlock that is meant to protect
all code that's not SMP safe.  In 2.2, this is a good part of the
kernel; in 2.4, it's not very much at all.  (It's reentrant
because it can be held across calls to schedule(), a normal
spinlock can't and would deadlock the system if you did that)
