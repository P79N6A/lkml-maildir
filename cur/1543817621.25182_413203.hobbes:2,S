Hello,
I've got some problems getting my USB stuff to work in 2.6.16.
I see normal USB initialization as the machine comes up, then suddenly:
ehci_hcd 0000:00:10.4: EHCI Host Controller
ehci_hcd 0000:00:10.4: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 5
ehci_hcd 0000:00:10.4: irq 17, io mem 0xf9e00000
ehci_hcd 0000:00:10.4: USB 2.0 started, EHCI 1.00, driver 10 Dec 2004
usb usb5: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
hub 5-0:1.0: USB hub found
usb 2-1: USB disconnect, address 2
hub 5-0:1.0: 8 ports detected
usb 2-2: USB disconnect, address 3
usb 3-1: USB disconnect, address 2
Initializing USB Mass Storage driver...
GSI 21 sharing vector 0xD1 and IRQ 21
usb 1-1: USB disconnect, address 2
drivers/usb/class/usblp.c: usblp0: removed
Everything that just got probed gets 'disconnected', udev's startup
script times out, and cupsd will hang forever looking for my printer.
Interestingly, it worked perfectly one time, and I saw a 'EHCI BIOS handoff
failed' message way at the top of dmesg.
What's going on? I assume this is EHCI's fault. I'm on a VIA K8T800 chipset,
Asus A8V Deluxe motherboard.
Please CC me on replies as I'm not subscribed to either list.
Thanks!
