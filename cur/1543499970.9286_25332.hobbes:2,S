Andrea,
I've gotten two very stiff lockups in 2.3.7 even my machine is 
a single processor box.
This happens under moderately heavy disk IO running a Perl script
(lxr) consistently with "swapoff -a". Well, it happened twice in
a row exactly and the "fsck" came out clean.
Try your patches and see what happens ?
Thanks
bill
