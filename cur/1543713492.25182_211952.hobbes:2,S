Didn't seem to slow the SELinux crowd down any...
You may not need the exact SELinux config language, but it does address the
issue of making something fairly easy for the sysadmin to write while not
requiring a large interpreter in the kernel (the kernel side of the selinuxfs
pseudo-filesystem is all of 14K, the loadpolicy is about a 4K binary and a 60K
shared library, and the policy compiler is about 100K and the shared lib).
So you're including a much bigger interface for little gain.  The total
footprint of the two solutions is about the same, but SELinux the vast majority
of it is in userspace, and only costs you when you're actually compiling/
loading a new policy, whereas yours takes up 100K of kernel space all the
time....

If you think that "all bugs are encapsulated" actually means anything in the
context of the Linux kernel, you're in for a very big surprise.
For example - your Lisp error messages go through the kernel log, so you're
using printk() and friends.  Note that it *is* possible for a buggy call to
printk() to cause problems for the kernel.
