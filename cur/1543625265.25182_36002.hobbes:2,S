in fact, you're right. At home, I don't have
this problem on any of my computers (nearly
all have an award bios). One of the two
victims at work was a compaq with a compaq
bios, while a friend's compaq notebook
(armada e500) is unaffected. All tested
hosts have either a 0e or a PNP0f13 entry.
I will dump the bios tomorrow, but I don't
know how pnpbios works (I presume it uses
some protected mode functions of int 15,
but I may be completely wrong). I will
have a great day reading the sources.
Willy
