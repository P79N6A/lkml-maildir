I still got the same problems on via :
 - hardisk used at UDMA33 instead of UDMA100 (buggy cable select ??? for
the primary CS value was 0xf1f1e6e6 and for the secondary 0x2727e6e6)
 - a cdrw drive lost interrupt when setting xfermode and make failed a
 port initialisation (if I comment the disable code, everythings seems to
 work)
