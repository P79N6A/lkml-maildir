Thomas,
Do you have the original driver source from VIA handy?  This is looking
more and more like a hardware bug - 2D acceleration engine activity
causes interrupts from the PCI slot to be disabled for long periods. 
Maybe it disables interrupts to prevent other processes writing to the
shared video/system RAM as it DMAs.  I would like to verify that the
problem still occurs with their driver, before I try to convince them
there's a hardware issue with the EPIA boards.
On that note, assuming I verify the bug, does anyone have any
recommendations for getting VIA to take me seriously?  The problem is
very easy to reproduce.
Lee
