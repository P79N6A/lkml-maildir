The way you have set up your subnets is not the usual way of going about
it, which is why the computer gets it "wrong"
The reason the kernel won't allow you to delete the route, is because you
need to specify the netmask with all route invocations under 2.1.XXX
Try changing your boot scripts so it runs:
ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.3 netmask 255.255.255.224 broadcast 192.168.1.31
route del -net 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.224 dev eth0
route add default netmask 0 gw 192.168.1.30 dev eth0
Of course a much better way would be to do:
ifconfig eth0 192.168.2.1 netmask 255.255.255.252 broadcast 192.168.2.3
route add default gw 192.168.2.2
and change the interface on the router you're connected to,
to 192.168.2.2/255.255.255.252
But I'm sure you have a valid reason for needing the network the way it
is.
