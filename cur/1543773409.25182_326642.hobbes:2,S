Indeed, but there is a zillion of different approaches to an A/D.
I'm quite sure IBM have rolled their own directly on the mainboard.
The main question is on which bus and which address it lives and what is
the programming interface. It's not something Analog Devices would know.
It can be on some monitoring chip living on the SMBus (most likely) or
coupled directly to the ACPI bridge on PCI, or anywhere else in the
system.

Well, I will not be interested until I'm convinced they'll be able to
tell me something I don't know already.

Well, some piece of software needs to park the HDD when the notebook is
falling, and that piece of software should better be running since the
notebook is powered on. Hence my suspicion it's in the BIOS. It doesn't
have to be visible to the user, at all.
