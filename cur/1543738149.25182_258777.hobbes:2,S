You're welcome.

Purely personal preference, I think "ret" is a more intuitive name for 
that variable.
+	if (copy_from_user(&kcmd, cmd, sizeof(struct i2o_cmd_hrtlct))) {
+		rc = -EFAULT;
+		goto exit;
+	}
 
[...]
+exit:
+	return rc;
 };
 
I prefer the 
if (foo)
	goto return_fault;
[...]
return_ret:
	return ret;
return_fault:
	ret = -EFAULT;
	goto return_ret;
variant. 
Sure, your way results in just a single mov and a single jmp when 
the branch is taken, but, my way has only a single jmp at each branch, 
then a mov and an additional jmp at the end, so for a single branch your 
way wins with   
1 mov + 1 jmp vs my 2 jmp's and 1 mov.
but, when you have a lot those branches my way generates less code. At 5 
branches you have 5 mov + 5 jmp while I'll have 1 mov + 6 jmp.
Also, my way takes up less space in the source, so more code fits on 
screen.
I doubt it matters much since this doesn't look like a very hot code path, 
but I prefer the version that generates the smaller code and takes up less 
space in the source.
Apart from those nitpicks it looks good to me :)
