Can we please rename write_super_lockfs to a sane name?
freeze_fs/thaw_fs sounds like a good name.

This looks ugly.  What about returning the superblock from the freeze
routine so you can simply pass it into the thaw routine?

This looks grossly misnamed again.  And why do you need to have
sync_super_locks splitted out?  Calling it on it's own doesn't make much
sense.

Again rather misplaced.  Even a fs not using bufferheads at all would
benefit from the interface.
