Arjan,
Thanks for taking time to review this.
A short background:
The current code uses vmalloc only. The potential use of kmalloc was 
introduced
to save memory and cpu-speed.
All agp drivers expect to see a single memory chunk, so I'm not sure we 
want to have an array of pages. That may require rewriting a lot of code.
If it's acceptable I'd like to go for the vmalloc / kmalloc flag, or at 
worst keep the current vmalloc only but that's such a _huge_ memory 
waste for small buffers. The flag was the original idea, but 
unfortunately the agp_memory struct is part of the drm interface, and I 
wasn't sure we could add a variable to it.
DaveJ, is it possible to extend struct agp_memory with a flags field?
Regards,
Thomas
