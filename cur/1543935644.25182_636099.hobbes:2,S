No patch was included.

Actually I was thinking 2.6.25 on both.
<looks>
   Kyle McMartin reports sysrq_timer_list_show() can hit the module
   mutex; these paths don't need to though, since we long ago changed all
   the module list manipulation to occur via stop_machine().
   Disabling preemption is enough.
Ah.  sysrq_timer_list_show() is called from interrupt.

OK, 2.6.24 seems reasonable.

Yes, it could all do with a revisit.
