Hi,
Thanks for the reply, but it seems I have wasted your time.
It works now that I upgraded the thing to 2.6.16 and alsa 1.0.11_rc4,
so I guess it's all fixed already. :)
I propably should have rechecked before resending the mail,
but I didn't notice there was a new alsa rc.
Anyway, well done, I'll mail if I should come across an actual bug. ;)
Cheers,
Friedrich Göpel
