Zwane's got a K6-2 500MHz. I've just managed to reproduce this on my
1.4GHz Opteron box (with Debian gcc 3.2). Here, the "ooh la la" bit
doesn't help. So my suspicion is that the printk is changing the
timing just enough on Zwane's box that he's getting a timer interrupt
knocking him out of vm86 mode before he hits a fatal bit in the fault
handling path for 4/4. Printks in handle_vm86_trap, handle_vm86_fault,
do_trap:vm86_trap, and do_general_protection:gp_in_vm86 never fire so
there's probably something amiss in the trampoline code.
