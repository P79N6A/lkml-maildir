As "the pathname of a process" isn't meaningful, I suppose you are trying to
get either the working directory of a process or the full pathname of the
executable.
They both can be found in /proc/#pid/ with names cwd and exe. They are symbolic
links to the directory and file (respectively), so you can even use them in
you shell scripts.
Cheers,
Willy
