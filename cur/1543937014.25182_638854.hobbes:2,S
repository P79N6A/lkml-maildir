Writeback cache on disk in iteself is not bad, it only gets bad if the
disk is not engineered to save all its dirty cache on power loss,
using the disk motor as a generator or alternatively a small battery.
It would be awfully nice to know which brands fail here, if any,
because writeback cache is a big performance booster.
