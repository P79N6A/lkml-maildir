That's the whole reason why I don't see any usefulness in merging SD
now. When we merge SD now, then we need to care of both - the real
solution and the fixup of regressions. Right now we have a not perfect
scheduler with known weak points. Ripping it out and replacing it is
going to introduce regressions, what ever low risk you see.
And I still do not see a benefit of an intermediate step with a in my
opinion medium to high risk of regressions, instead of going the full
way, when we agree that this is the correct solution.
