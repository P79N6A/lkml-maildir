Typically, objects that LSM cares about include a pointer to opaque
data (security blob) which describes the security domain for the object.
See task->security as an example.  It's not clear to me if task->security
is sufficient and you only need a back pointer to the task or if each
PAG needs it's own security blob.

Sounds like an extension to rlimits.  The counters could be stored in
->user to limit the userwide number of tokens.
