And we collectively told Jiri where to stick that.
So let's recap:
1) Jiri submitted a borked patch that changed the licenses.
2) We didn't accept said patch.
3) There's then a whole big fuss about a *NON EXISTENT PROBLEM*.
I could see where the *BSD people could complain if we had *accepted and
distributed* said patch.  But it was wrong, we recognized it was wrong,
and the system is working as designed.  So let's quit the flamefest already.
Geez.
