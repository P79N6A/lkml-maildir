  I agree that malicious user can make some user run out of quotas
(actually he can do it even by more secret way by just opening the files
- but for this at least read permission is needed). But I guess that
reasonably capable admin discovers the problem and /bin/nologin as a
login shell solves the problem...

  Yes they would but denying hardlinks across 'quota trees' seems to be
the easiest way of making them technically possible and so you end up in
a similar situation as with some security patches...
