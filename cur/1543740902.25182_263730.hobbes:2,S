'scuse me, but have you tried to buy one of those locally?  The 
unwashed masses of us are stuck with whatever we can buy at Circuit 
City et all, and the cheapest thing today for an AGP slot is the 
house brands of the 9200 SE w/128 megs of ddr ram.

Has this links code been substantially updated since the 6.8.1 release 
as built on an x86 system?  If not, then this common readily 
available card is still not supported all that well, my lspci outputs 
say the vendor codes are unknown.  And my glxgears is 198 fps.
