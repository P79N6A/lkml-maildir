No. It works fine (or seems to) with 2:2 mapping. I've tested with these 
extensively
and am shipping products on the 1U appliances with 2:2 and I have never 
seen any problems
with 2.6.9-2.6.13.
The only unpleasant side affect with 3:1 is user apps seem to rely on 
swap space
a little more than I like -- perhaps this is the side affect you are 
referring to?
RH ES uses 4:4 which is ideal and superior to this hack.
