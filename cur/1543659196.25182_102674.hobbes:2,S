That exactly is the problem. If they are where the goto would be
they needlessly fill the CPU's pipeline, take up space in L1 and use
up bandwidth on the busses.
A goto is much shorter than a cleanup.
And you would have to jump. Any control structure will result in one
or more conditional jumps in the assembler code (or conditional instructions)
Turning "if (a) goto b;"  into a single branch instruction is trivial.
The best the compiler can do with
if (a) {
	cleanup();
	return err;
}
is putting the conditional code on the end of the function.
So in the best case the compiler can generate almost equivalent code
at a cost of maintainability.

Correct. If you mean that literally, you've grasped an important concept.
You grow the kernel only with good cause.
And you look where you add the code. Additional device drivers don't hurt.
A computed jump is still only one computed jump. Additional code in common
code paths of the core hurts a lot.
For the inner loops of core code there are two considerations, size and
reducing jumps.
