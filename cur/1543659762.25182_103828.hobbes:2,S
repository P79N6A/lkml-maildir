I'm not keen on the way the minisched patch got reformatted. I changed
it into a seperate function, which I think is much cleaner by the time
you've added the third patch - no #ifdef CONFIG_NUMA in load_balance.
Rejigged patches attatched, no functional changes.
Anyway, I perf tested this, and it comes out more or less the same as
the tuned version I was poking at last night (ie best of the bunch).
Looks pretty good to me.

PS. The fourth patch was so small, and touching the same stuff as 3
that I rolled it into the third one here. Seems like a universal 
benefit ;-)[unhandled content-type:application/octet-stream][unhandled content-type:application/octet-stream][unhandled content-type:application/octet-stream]
