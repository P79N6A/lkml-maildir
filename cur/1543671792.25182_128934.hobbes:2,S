As I understand it, it is telling you that your programs spends 68% of
its time is kernel space, ie, waiting your pages to come from disk. It
does not mean that the CPU is doing anything, but it is locked by the
kernel.
If you can't afford to buy more memory, recode the thing. So much thrashing
looks like you access your data very randomly. Try to process the data
in a more sequential way, so you just fault after processing a big bunch
of data. With 700Mb of data and a 512Mb box, at least half of your data
fit in memory, so under an ideal sequential access you just would page
300Mb one time...
