Yes (if not all forgotten).
I was waiting for 2.7, but that seems to be the wrong thing to do.
Can you show/tell me where _POSIX_HOST_NAME_MAX is specified to be
at least 256?  All that I have found so far is SuSv3
[ 
http://www.unix.org/single_unix_specification/
 ], which says for
sys/utsname.h - system name structure:
char  sysname[]  Name of this implementation of the operating system. 
char  nodename[] Name of this node within the communications 
                 network to which this node is attached, if any. 
char  release[]  Current release level of this implementation. 
char  version[]  Current version level of this release. 
char  machine[]  Name of the hardware type on which the system is running. 
The character arrays are of unspecified size, but the data stored in them
shall be terminated by a null byte.

and LSB 2.0.1:
[ 
http://refspecs.freestandards.org/LSB_2.0.1/LSB-Core/LSB-Core.html
 ]
Maximum length of a host name (not including the terminating null) as returned
from the gethostname function shall be at least 255 bytes.

Is there somewhere else to look?
Anyway, I'm willing to do the kernel work if you want help with it.
