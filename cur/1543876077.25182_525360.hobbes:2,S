Sorry guys,
I have spent the last three weeks trying to track
down a problem one of our customers has been having,
the only thing I have been able to determine is that using
mutex'es the kernel crashes and using semaphores instead
works. Now I realize that the target is to use mutexes,
but I have been really at my wits end trying to solve the
problem. As a result I am just now doing an external
module tar ball version and with a bit of luck I should
be able to post it on our web site, so that our customers
can download it, before I take my two week easter
holiday starting in one hour. Since I have restructured
the driver several times trying to get a handle on the
problem, I think the kernel patch is going to be a complete
replacement, which will take a couple of weeks to squeeze
all the lines into 80 columns.
