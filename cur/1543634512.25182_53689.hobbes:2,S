just checked 2 but no improvement, also checked without drm again no 
solution...
otherwise the system seems stable (also when running X) but I also saw the 
'spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7.' message after a couple of minutes. I know 
that this has got something to do with local apic, but nothing more...
this is from dmesg:
Local APIC disabled by BIOS -- reenabling.
Found and enabled local APIC!
Initializing CPU#0
<snip>
Using local APIC timer interrupts.
calibrating APIC timer ...
..... CPU clock speed is 1128.5606 MHz.
..... host bus clock speed is 265.5435 MHz.
cpu: 0, clocks: 2655435, slice: 1327717
CPU0<T0:2655424,T1:1327696,D:11,S:1327717,C:2655435>
(interresting: this differs from 2.4.19-pre10-ac2... but there I get the same 
spurious interrupt)
