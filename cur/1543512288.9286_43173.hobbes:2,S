Just how do you think devfsd talks to the kernel?  Devfsd uses the
/dev/.devfsd device to communicate with the user-space daemon,
something which I do not consider inefficient..  Just how efficient does
it have to be for _you_ to consider it efficient?  Should we consider
removing /proc because you consider it inefficient?

For example?  What does this example have to do with devfsd being
inefficient.. It's simply stating that there are reasons one might want to
use it.

Yes, that would be very wrong.  It's a Good Thing devfsd doesn't do this.
Your misinformation is not welcome.
(zinx@bliss)/tmp/zinx/devfsd$ grep "readdir" devfsd.c
(zinx@bliss)/tmp/zinx/devfsd$
(zinx@bliss)/tmp/zinx/devfsd$ grep "stat (" devfsd.c
        if (stat (CONFIG_FILE, &statbuf) != 0)
    if (lstat (path, &statbuf) != 0)
(zinx@bliss)/tmp/zinx/devfsd$
I fail to see how anyone who even attempted to look at devfsd could make
this mistake.

I would suggest to all those against devfs:
    Look at it.  Look at it close.  Make sure your arguements are valid.
