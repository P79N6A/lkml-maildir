   [PATCH] strip.c: don't allocate net_device as part of private struct
   
   hi jeff
   
   cleans up strip.c not to allocate struct net_device as part of the private
   structure. use a separate kmalloc (and kfree). compile tested only.
   against 2.5.73-bk

   Fix misreporting of card type and spurious "already scheduled" messages.
<dave@thedillows.org> (03/02/22 1.889.238.1)
   Use a non-zero rx_copybreak to avoid charging a full MTU to the
   socket on tiny packets.
   
   Dave Miller suggested 256, I used 200 to be more consistent with the
   other network drivers.
