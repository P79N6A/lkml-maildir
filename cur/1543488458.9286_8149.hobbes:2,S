Hi there,
I've got an old Aztech soundcard equipped with an AD1848 (I don't know about
its exact specs). It works fine under 2.0.x with both PSS and MSS enabled in the
sound driver, although this combination is not recommended at all...
Under 2.2.x, I couldn't figure out how I could get it to work correctly.
It shows some signs of life with the AD1848 driver: everything believes it's
OK, and there's certainly some sound coming out of it, but it's so silent that
it's almost unhearable... In fact, I've heard about others who experienced the
very same problem with different AD1848-based cards.
Any ideas ?
Thanks a lot,
Andras
