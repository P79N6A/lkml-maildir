thanks for your input here. as it only happened once, I think it would be of
no use to change the stuff. however, it might be a good idea to have the BT
code maker (lnz@dandelion.com IIRC) take a look at your suggestion, or not ?
to me it happened after I presumably toggled the off/on switch too fast.
maybe the JAZ didn't reset OK.
