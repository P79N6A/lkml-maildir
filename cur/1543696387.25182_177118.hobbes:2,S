Quite frankly, if it's literally been broken since 2.3.x, I think the best 
thing to do would be to remove the driver entirely.
Yeah, there's probably a fair number of those old CD-ROM drivers that 
nobody uses with modern kernels (ie they might be used on some router that 
hasn't been touched in forever, still running 2.2.x on a 8MB 386SX-16).
