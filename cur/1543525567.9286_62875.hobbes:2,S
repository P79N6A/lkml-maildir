: So for $100 dollars you get a CPU, a network interface, and enough memory to

: running all this stuff that you could hot plug regular drives into.  You could 
: spend a little more money and build such a cage that holds a couple drives, 
: then I think it would make perfect sense to run linux on the cage to give you 
: cheap "mini" network servers.  I would imagine such devices could sell for 
: around $150-200 for 2-4 drive capacities.  They could have a boot prom to 
: netboot a kernel, and wouldn't really need much else.
Suppose I want to run STP down on the drive.  Calculate out the cost to do
that in hardware and then tell me that I couldn't get there both quicker
and cheaper by putting Linux down there.
