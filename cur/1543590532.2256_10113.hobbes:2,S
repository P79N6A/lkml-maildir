Hi,
How can I determine if the build my device driver is being compiled under is
a standard kernel.org one or a Red Hat one ?
The problem is I have a driver that includes syncppp.h which in the releases
from kernel.org is in linux/drivers/net/wan/ up to and including 2.4.2 after
which it moves to linux/include/net/. Can cope with this easily enough with
a "#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE > KERNEL_VERSION(2,4,2)" but unfortunatly the
kernel source supplied with Red Hat 7.1 reports itself as 2.4.2 but already
has the syncppp changes from 2.4.3.
I was shown a trick to solve a similar problem under 2.2.x but the symbol
defined as a side effect of including one of the standard system headers
is no longer present :-(
