You need to use a shorter name, I think.

Yes, but sockaddr_pkt.spkt_device[] is only 14 bytes for some reason.

These objects are shared with userspace applications, I believe.  We're
stuck with it.

This scribbles on sockaddr_pkt.spkt_protocol.
Probably what we need to do here is to put a bit of range-checking into the
userspace tool.  Is it nameif?
