I think the problem you're seeing is strange enough to consider trying the 
(possibly odd sounding) test.  I haven't seen an explanation of why nice 
-20 doesn't work for you.

It may not make any difference.  Seeing that would at least be an 
additional datapoint.  The only significant difference I see between a 
gaggle of SCHED_FIFO tasks and one of nice -20 tasks, who are alone in 
their top-of-the-heap queue, and who are not cpu hogs, is the timeslice.  I 
don't recall there being any wakeup/preempt logic differences, ergo the 
SCHED_RR suggestion.
