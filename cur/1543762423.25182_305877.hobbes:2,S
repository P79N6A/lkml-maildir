Definitely; it's the one I gave akpm.  The lock reworking is going to
remove one layer of locks, so it's worthwhile from that point of view;
but it's longer-term, and I don't know for sure of any paths to chaos
with that simpler journal_unmap_buffer() fix in place.  (It's just very
hard to _prove_ all cases are correct without the locking rework.)
