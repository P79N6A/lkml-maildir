They are quite different. 
Infact CLUSTERED_APIC_XAPIC just means using physical APIC mode and is kind of a
misnomer as xAPIC doesn't necessariy mean physical APIC mode. 
xapic_support says whether xAPIC support is there or not. Then APICs 
can be configured either in physical or logical modes. I mainly need this as
with xAPIC support, we have:
- LAPIC and IOAPIC have there own name space, 
- max or 255 CPUS with 0xff as broadcast, as opposed to 0xf broadcast in case of no xAPIC

Now I am getting a bit confused here. I am using physical mode with no clustering
whatsoever. Thats what I felt even Summit was doing in 2.4.
