Thank you for the patch. 
I tried it and found the the process cloned by my test program became
the zombie child of my shell and is not reaped because the shell is
not expecting the process.
# ps lw
  F   UID   PID  PPID PRI  NI   VSZ  RSS WCHAN  STAT TTY        TIME COMMAND
000     0  1180  1176  14   0  3392 1640 wait4  S    pts/1      0:00 bash

This is okay because when the shell is terminated, the child is also reaped,
but it seems a little strange.
