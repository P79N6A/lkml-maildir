Argh, I hate this.  I fail to see what progress a process could make if
it kills everything _and_ itself.  I frequently use "kill -9 -1" to kill
everything except my shell, and now I'll have to kill everything else
manually, one by one.
If a process wants to commit suicide too, why doesn't it just do that
after?
