How about we put in some sort of console logging tool so we can buffer
and log the console output better?  Currently if I have both a serial
and tty console defined, my GDM prompter looses the mouse until I goto
the XDMCP chooser and back again.  
I'm pretty sure it's a GDM problem, since Xdm doesn't have this issue
at all.  Haven't had time to chase it though.
In any case, having some way to log oopses better would be really
nice.  Not sure how we could do it reliably for suspend/resume needs
on laptops without dedicated management hardware like the ILOM stuff
on Intel/Sun boxes.  
Dunno... just viocing my desires...
