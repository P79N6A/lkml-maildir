I confirm that 0x7f is full speed.

That's where things get really really interesting.  As mentioned above 
0x7f drives the fan full speed (2596 RPM).  Now lowering that value 
slows the CPU fan gradually down to a certain point.  With a value of 
0x3f the fan turns at 1041 RPM.  But below 0x3f the fan starts speeding 
up again to reach a peak of 2280 RPM with a value of 0x31, then it slows 
down again toward 0 RPM as the register value is decreased down to 0.
Bit 3 of register 0x14, when set, only modifies the curve so the first 
minimum is instead reached at 0x30 then the peak occurs at 0x1d before 
dropping to 0.
Changing the PWM base clock select has no effect.
