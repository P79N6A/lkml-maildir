Yeah, you're right.  I was tired when I wrote it,
however, the exec command still isn't quite
complete.  Normally, you'd want a command to be
exec'ing.
In theory, the exec command by itself should (I think) just
redirect for the rest of your commands... However, it would
appear that there's a bug in bash for that syntax.
(i.e. If I type it in on the command line, It doesn't work for me, either).
In this case, I think you're going to be better off to just start
your processes with the output going direct  logger...
my (more successful) way of doing this is:
{
	command 1
	command2
	command3
} | logger -t $0[$$]
(needs a semicolon before the '}' if it's a one-liner.
It's also more portable (compatible with old bourne shells)
I prefer to save things like the named pipe syntax for the really
ornery situations where bourne-compatible syntax jusr doesn't
do the job.
