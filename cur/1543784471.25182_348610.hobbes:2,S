Yes, that is usually a good indication that a generic function should be
provided.  However having a generic function with complicated and long
arguments is no use as everyone will want their own shorter one anyway.
And given the function is static inline it actually makes no difference
to the generated code size.  Also calling it __vmalloc_fast makes no
sense as it doesn't always use vmalloc...  Given we have kmalloc and
vmalloc maybe it should be just malloc?
Obviously if there were a suitable generic function I would use it but I
and I imagine all the other users would still wrap it with the old name.
Best regards,
        Anton
