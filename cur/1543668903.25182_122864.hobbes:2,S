Can you clarify ... are these VMAs all mapping the same address space,
or different ones? If the same, are you mapping the whole thing each time?

If mapping the *whole* address space hundreds of times, why would anyone 
ever actually want to do that? It kills some important optimisations that 
Dave has made, and seems to be an unrealistic test case. I don't understand
what you're trying to simulate with that (if that's what you are doing).
Mapping 1000 subsegments I can understand, but not the whole thing.
Is excellent to actually have a tool to do real testing on this stuff
with though ... thanks ;-)

So mm4 has what? No partial objrmap at all (you dropped it?)? 
Or partial but non anon?

Well, it also consumes the most space. How about adding a test that has
1000s of processes mapping one large (2GB say) VMA, and seeing what that 
does? That's the workload of lots of database type things.

Indeed. Which includes not locking up the whole box in a solid hang
from ZONE_NORMAL consumption though ...

Cool, thanks ... I'll try to have a play with your tools later this evening.
