On the brightside, md raid5 is often faster than hardware raid5.  At 
least on the 7000 and 8000 series of 3ware hardware; the 9000 series 
looks promising though.  I haven't seen megaraid SATA numbers, and I 
don't know what happened to the SX8.
When the libata Marvell drivers come out, you'll have a cheap upgrade 
path for PCI-X boards if you want fast md raid:

$100 to add 8 unbottlenecked SATA ports to your server motherboard.
