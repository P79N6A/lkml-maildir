PMJFI, and I'm not driver model expert, but I can think I can answer 
this one. Yes, you are correct, these two sysfs directories are 
associated with the same physical devices. However, they are definitely 
two different things.
The first is an IDE device. It has attributes common to IDE devices, 
like DMA/PIO mode, cable type, bus speed, etc.
The second is a block device. A _generic_ block device. It has 
attributes like length, dev (its device number), I/O scheduler settings, 
etc.
These are two wildly differing views, but yes, they are the same device. 
These differing attributes do _not_ belong in the same directory. An 
application looking at your IDE devices does not really care how the 
block subsystem perceives those devices (i.e. hdparm). Conversely, an 
application looking at your block devices should not care about what 
underlying physical devices (if any :-) they are associated with.
