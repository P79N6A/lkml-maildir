First and foremost, root user is handled as usual, so kernel tasks should
also be handled as usual if they always run as root...
but I've yet to find out how to check if a task is a kernel thread or not,
and skip these explicitely just to be safe.
Also, while I've coded it on a kernel thread, I'd settle perfectly to a
periodic timer, but I don't know yet ask for one... perhaps a
self-propagating workqueue entry with a delay?

So, when trying to add a task to the per-user pending tasks, I'd have
to do this:
1. spin_lock_irqsave(uidhash_lock, flags)
2. spin_lock(my_user->user_lock)
3. spin_unlock_restore(uidhash_lock, flags);
Is this any good?
Could I simply do "spin_unlock(my_user->user_lock)" at end without
taking the uidhash_lock again?

What do I need to lock when I want to add a task to a runqueue?
I'm doing a "spin_lock_irq(this_rq()->lock);"
As you can see, I'm not yet at speed with the locking rules... any
online references to the latest locking rules? The BKL was really
easy to understand in comparison! *grin*
Greets, Antonio.
