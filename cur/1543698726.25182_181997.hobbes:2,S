If it said "user-space" or "non-kernel address space" in the Linux license
then I would agree.
But the exact wording is much more vague:
"user programs that use kernel services by normal system calls"
Any binary loadable kernel module can be considered a "user program"
Any interface defined in the kernel header files can be considered a "normal
system call"
This is why I think further clarification is warranted in future versions of
copying.txt - because we are needlessly giving away the source-code freedom
that GPL is intended to protect.
The proponents of binary-only kernel modules currently use the above as a
defense to argue their case for GPL non-compliance.
