this call_for_each_cic/radix_tree_gang_lookup locked up, and all other 
CPUs deadlocked in stopmachine, due to this one.
call_for_each_cic is in ./block/cfq-iosched.c uses RCU, but you've got 
classic-RCU:
  CONFIG_CLASSIC_RCU=y
  # CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU is not set
so it's not related to the preempt-RCU changes either.
It is this part that locks up:
        do {
...
                nr = radix_tree_gang_lookup(&ioc->radix_root, (void **) cics,
                                                index, CIC_GANG_NR);
...
        } while (nr == CIC_GANG_NR);
...
it seems the radix tree will yield new entries again and again. Either 
it got corrupted, or some other CPU is filling it faster than we can 
deplete it [unlikely i think].
