I booted into a shell from a floppy disk. There were no drivers
installed, not even the IDE driver. I could not reboot windows
after linux was up and rebooted. This was Linux-2.6.13.4. Then
I tried linux-2.4.26 which corresponds to the version when I
first reported this problem. The same thing happens. Therefore,
I temporarily modified linux-2.6.13.4 to force a triple-fault
and processor reset when doing a reboot. With this temporary
modification it is possible to boot windows after Linux was
running.
This is the reboot patch. It is not a "solution", just something
that shows that the current reboot code doesn't force the BIOS
to start from scratch, which is essential when changing operating
systems.

Just in case the M$ mailer screws up everything, the patch
is attached also.
