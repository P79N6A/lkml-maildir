Subject: 802.1Q VLAN code, version 0.0.2 is released (PRE-ALPHA)

I'm sorry for the lousy state of 0.0.1.  Maybe this will make
amends somewhat!
This code should actually be able to add and remove VLAN devices
to/from an ethernet device.
I haven't been able to test it because I have to buy another computer
first so I can actually pass traffic (ideas on how to do this on one
machine are welcome.)
I'm working on patches to tcpdump and the libpcap distributions to
allow them to deal with VLANs.  I'll release those as soon as I
have any idea that they may be working correctly!
Distribution is here:

Next Steps:
	*  Grep for TODO and resolve all of those questions.
	*  Set up a real network of 2-3 computers and pass VLAN traffic.
	*  Overhaul code to allow 4096 VLAN's per computer, not per NIC,
		which is how it works today.  This will envolve spanning
		trees and layer 2 switching, I think.
	*  Look into bridging VLAN devices to ATM (P/SVC) devices), FrameRelay
		DLCI's and other types of devices.
	*  Enable VLANs over other devices, not just ethernet??
	*  Debug everything we just broke adding the aforementioned code :)
The patch is against the 2.2.2 release, though I think it will work on
any
thing 2.2.0 and up.  YMMV.
Please let me know if you have problems or suggestions, I have more
time to answer them now than before!
Enjoy,
Ben
