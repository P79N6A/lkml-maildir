Thanks for the reply. The external clock is set to 66 mhx acording to the
jumpers on the mohterboard. The ram I'm using has two labels on it.  One says
PC-100 Q-4SD64.  The other says 505089/35   /SDIM4X6410PC100.  The chips have
numbers that look like this.
9922 	1-1
MT	48LC4M16A2
TG	-8e B
As you can tell I know little about hardware so any suggestions are
appreciated.
