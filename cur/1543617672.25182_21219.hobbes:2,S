Is the BLKGETSIZE64 ioctl supposed to return the size of the device in 
bytes (as the comment says, and is implemented in all places *except* 
blkpg.c), or in sectors (as is implemented in blkpg.c since 2.4.15)?
It would seem that blkpg.c gets it wrong, that it should be in bytes.  
Assuming that's the case, here's the patch to fix it against 2.4.18-pre4.
Thanks,
Matt
