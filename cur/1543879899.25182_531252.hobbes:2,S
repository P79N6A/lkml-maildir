True. This would also imply that we only ever must free a kobject with
kobject_put() if kobject_init() has been called.

Yes, struct device might be enough for most use cases. However, this
would involve looking hard at the code :)

The basic infrastructure isn't too hard (I'm having a patch using mkobj
on my disk that is in nearly workable state). And I think that this is
something that really should be fixed - it is just way too easy for a
driver writer to mess this up (and the race window becomes even bigger
on virtualized platforms).
