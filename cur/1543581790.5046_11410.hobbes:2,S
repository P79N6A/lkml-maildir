Dear Mike and others ,
I am using compressed ramdisk , i can not turn off cramfs .
my error messages are very strange and irreregular .
i am getting 3 different kind of error messages :-
invalid compressed format (err=1)
OR
invalid compressed format (err=2)
OR
crc error
I am using gzip 1.2.4 (18 Aug 93)
But when i use same ramdisk with old kernel like 2.2.12 , it works fine .
Please help me.
Thanks ,
Best Regards,
Jaswinder.
