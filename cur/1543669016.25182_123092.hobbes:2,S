I am now very confused.
That patch _is_ in 2.5.66-bk12.  If a `patch -R' of that patch made bk12 work
correctly then the patch was the source of the changed behaviour.
Please start again ;)
Test 2.5.66, then 2.5.66-bk12, then 2.5.66-bk12 with a `patch -R' of
the patch which I sent in the earlier email.
Thanks again.
