EXPERIMENTAL is most often enabled by distributors.
And we are still missing our much-needed CONFIG_EXPERT :-(

Point taken. Ehm, I already once tried making a 10000-Hz kernel
around 2.6.13-15 or so. It did not compile because some header files had
#error directives for HZ >= 1536. (jiffies.h:33 if you want
to know.) IIRC there also was another place somewhere in networking
code that #errors out at >8192.
