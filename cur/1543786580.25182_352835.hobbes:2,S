It is not legal to call copy_to/from_user() under a spinlock in general.
But what _is_ legal to do is something slightly more complex, ie
	spin_lock(...)
	inc_preempt_count();
	ret = __copy_from_user_inatomic(..)
	dec_preempt_count();
	spin_unlock();
but you have to realize that the copy-from-user will fail if the target is 
swapped out (so the code that does things like this has to look at the 
return value, and if the copy didn't copy anything it needs to release the 
locks and do it all over again without the atomic thing).
We don't do it very much, because it gets more complicated and it hasn't
historically been legal, but it could in theory be very useful if you hold
a lock and want to avoid releasing and re-taking it just to do a user
access.
Right now the only case where that happens is the futex code, and maybe 
that's a very special case. But maybe it isn't.
