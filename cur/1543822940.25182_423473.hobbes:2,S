The solution would be to either stick bash in the kernel (YUCK!)
or to have the kernel basically copy the read-only script to /tmp
or somewhere else, set permissions to sane values and
/bin/sh /tmp/foo.a12345.
Now why on earth would one want the kernel to jump all those hoops
instead of just requiring read access on anything with a shebang?
Naturally, bash has to be supplemented by any other gorramn shell
out there and naturally perl and anything at all that can be invoked
using a shebang, since bash doesn't know how to execute perl
and perl doesn't know how to execute shell and .. and .. and...
So either copy it and set sane values or require read-access
on the file.
