Well not really - for example you now have drivers/input/joystick/analog.c
including asm/8253pit.h, which not all architectures implement.
The basic problem is that we have generic code referring to an x86-specific
lock inside `#ifdef __i386__'.
Perhaps what you could do is to declare those locks in
include/asm-i386/hardirq.h and then make sure that all the relevant files
include <linux/hardirq.h>.  That's a bit of an abuse of hardirq.h, but we
don't have a generic "platform.h" place to put things like this.
If abusing hardirq.h offends you then you could make sure that all
architectures implement asm/rtc.h (most already do) (just copy
include/asm-alpha/rtc.h) and put the declarations in
include/asm-i386/rtc.h, which is more appropriate.
Whichever way you go, please check that x86_64 works OK too.
