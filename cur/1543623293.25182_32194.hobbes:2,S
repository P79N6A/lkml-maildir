rmap would seem to buy us (at least) two major things for NUMA:
1) We can balance between zones easier by "swapping out"
pages to another zone.
2) We can do local per-node scanning - no need to bounce
information to and fro across the interconnect just to see what's
worth swapping out.
I suspect that the performance of NUMA under memory pressure
without the rmap stuff will be truly horrific, as we decend into 
a cache-trashing page transfer war. 
I can't see any way to fix this without some sort of rmap - any
other suggestions as to how this might be done?
Thanks,
Martin.
