I'm running on RHL 9 with 2.5.67-mm3 (plus Russell King PCMCIA/CardBus
patches) and updated modutils + procutils + nfs-utils. It works
flawlessly, although I needed some tweaking for "/etc/init.d/rc.sysinit"
which insists in setting the module and hotplug helper binaries to
"/sbin/true" due to missing "/proc/ksyms".
