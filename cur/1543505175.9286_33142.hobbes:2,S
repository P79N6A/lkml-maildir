Subject: does 2.3.13-pre8 PPP support bundled async multiline pppd?

--Sorry that this is somewhat off-topic:
i've noticed i can't get EQL working on multi-line async pppd
connections in 2.3.13-pre8.  It drops every other packet.  i'm
using pppd-pre-2.3.9 and have made the proper /dev/ppp.
Has 2.3.13 PPP progressed to the point where it supports bundled
connections natively, and if so, what would be the procedure?
If there's an explanation on the Web somewhere, rather than
waste bandwidth i'll head there once someone points it out for me.
thanks,
ben (who doesn't want to get back into doing SLIP)
