You have to be hitting the inode cache pretty hard for this to be a big
deal, right? And that cache is already hidden behind the dcache, right?
I think the saving memory side of your argument is better than the cache
footprint one..
Perhaps there's another clever way to do this - is there a way to make the
list heads partially overlap? That is &hash[i-1].next == &hash[i].prev?
Sick, I know, but it might not mean a separate list implementation, just
special initialization - HASHLISTHEAD().
