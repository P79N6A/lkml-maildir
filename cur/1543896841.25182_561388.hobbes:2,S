This entire thread is confused :)
Going back to $subject, it is relevant only to the scant few old-IDE 
drivers that do indeed successfully probe and talk to SATA drives, from 
SATA controllers.
The vast majority have always used libata for SATA, but another option 
did indeed exist before libata appeared, for a few controllers.
Alan was just having a bit of fun at dwmw2's expense, since we do indeed 
want to see libata drivers for PowerPC PATA as well :)
