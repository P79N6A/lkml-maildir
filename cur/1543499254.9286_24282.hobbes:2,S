If the only two tasks in the system that wants the kernel lock are the
wakenup task and the current-running task, then rescheduling the wakenup
task in _place_ of the current task will work _fine_. There _won't_ be any
contention of the lock simply because the current task will go offline
waiting the next schedule sleeping in the _run_queue.
