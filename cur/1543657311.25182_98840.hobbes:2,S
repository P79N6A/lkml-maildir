It'll tend to usually work because GFP_KERNEL allocations prefer to
not dip into the DMA region.

But it's not!  dma_alloc_coherent() is using GFP_ATOMIC|__GFP_DMA.
Now, if we can fix the caller to use
	__GFP_WAIT | __GFP_IO | __GFP_HIGHIO | __GFP_FS | __GFP_DMA
then that at least will allow page reclaim.
Then we can remove this restriction in __alloc_pages():
        /*
         * Don't let big-order allocations loop.  Yield for kswapd, try again.
         */
        if (order <= 3) {
                yield();
                goto rebalance;
        }
and all will be well.
dma_alloc_coherent() should be fixed to take a gfp_mask, and callers
should be updated.
As for permitting direct page reclaim for higher-order allocations: I
just don't know - it's from before my time.  Perhaps the VM will livelock.
