Please note that I don't think that any of the people concerned with
this problem are on l-k.  Please post any replies to linux-arm as well
as linux-kernel.  Thanks.

It's actually more complicated than that.  'choice' does not behave the same
way as the other commands in the config file - it is never grayed out under
any circumstances, and I also suspect that even when it is supposed to be
grayed out and no options selected, it still defines one option.
I don't think it's a case of undefining the unselected variables.  The
config is:
  select machine using choice
  if machine was a footbridge
    select host or add-in from a choice
Since the 'if' makes no odds to the second choice in xconfig, it breaks.
I'll post this to linux-kernel as well.  If they want to see the exact case,
have a look at the latest ARM config.in patches for 2.2.1 on
ftp://ftp.arm.linux.org.uk/pub/armlinux/kernel-sources/v2.2
