I assume the GCC testsuite has the same generic problem, which is probably why 
it uses the -fdump-tree-optimized parameter to gcc. For example:
alistair@just:~$ cat test.c
void __attribute__((weak)) func(void)
{
    /* no code */
}
int main()
{
    func();
    return 0;
}
alistair@just:~$ gcc -O2 -fdump-tree-optimized test.c
alistair@just:~$ rm -f a.out
alistair@just:~$ cat test.c*.optimized | egrep "func \\(\\);"
  func ();
Ergo, my compiler isn't buggy. As this doesn't require a runtime test I think 
it would be OK for the kernel.
Of course, whether or not it's worth it is now debatable, given the 
information Sven-Haegar Koch provided (Debian's GCC version number is 
actually 4.1.2).
