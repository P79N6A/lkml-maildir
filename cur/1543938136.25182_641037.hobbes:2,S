Hmm, the Geode LX platform I work with uses VSA/SMM and I have had no
problems using timer 2 for a watchdog.  Some of the timers are certainly
already setup by something in the BIOS, but quite a few are not in use.
The board I am using is the compulab iGLX module.  I did have to mangle
together a watchdog driver myself some time ago since there wasn't one
for the Geode LX at the time.
Of course I haven't gone past 2.6.18 kernel for now (I am tracking
Debian stable for the most part), so I have no idea if something in a
newer kernel breaks things.
