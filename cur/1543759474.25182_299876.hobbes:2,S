hello,
      I have a /proc file kernel module with its proc
read function as
static char mybuf[1024];
ssize_t my_file_read(struct file *filp, char *buf,
size_t count, loff_t *ppos)
{
   printk("Reading a from a /proc file....\n");
   static int b_read = 0;
    int len = strlen(mybuf);
    if (len == 0 || b_read) {
        b_read = 0;
        return 0;
    }
    if (len > count - 1)
        len = count - 1;
    copy_to_user(buf, mybuf, len);
    put_user(0, &buf[len]);
    ++len;
    b_read = 1;
    return len;
}
when i strace cat /proc/my_file i found message
printing twice
Reading a from a /proc file....
Reading a from a /proc file....
       Why that happening?
          Also i check by writing to it as cat >
/proc/my_file
and got single result for write function call not
twice as for read.
regards,
cranium
