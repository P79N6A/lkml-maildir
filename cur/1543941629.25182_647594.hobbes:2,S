Just a correction, rmaps exists or swap couldn't be sane, it's just
that it's not built on the page_t because the guest memory is really
virtual and not physical at all (hence it swaps really well, thanks to
the regular linux VM algorithms without requiring any KVM knowledge at
all, it all looks (shared) anonymous memory as far as linux is
concerned ;).
