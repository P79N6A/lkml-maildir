Hmm...
It doesn't works on my machine.
panic at booting at __free_pages_ok() with blow call trace.
[<hex number>] free_all_bootmem_core
[<hex number>] mem_init
[<hex number>] alloc_large_system_hash
[<hex number>] inode_init_early
[<hex number>] start_kernel
[<hex number>] unknown_bootoption
my machine spec
	CPU:   Pentium4 with HT
	MEM:   512M
I will try more investigate.
but I have no time for a while, sorry ;-)
BTW:
when config sparse mem turn on instead discontig mem.
panic at booting at get_pageblock_flags_group() with below call stack.
free_initrd
	free_init_pages
		free_hot_cold_page
