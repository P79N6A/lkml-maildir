I haven't looked much at the AFS support in the mainline kernel,
but I believe it is read-only support, and doesn't support
authentication.  It may well have no need for a system call.
I was actually referring to the OpenAFS implementation, which is built
separately from the kernel as a module; thus, the #ifdef CONFIG_AFS
would not work.  An additional configuration option could be added, but
I'm not sure that is a good idea.
