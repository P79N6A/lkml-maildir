I am experiencing the same problem with recent kernels.  This machine
has 2 Maxtor drives (4D080H4) with the same invalid serial number
( D4000000 ).  The machine was happily running Fedora Core 2 for quite
some time with no hard drive errors.  The drives themselves were
previously installed in a Windows XP machine, also without incident.
Note that in the current machine, Windows XP 64-bit beta Device Manager
also displays an error related to duplicate drive IDs.
System motherboard is a Chaintech VNF3-250 (NForce3). One drive is on
the onboard IDE controller, the other is attached to a Silicon Image PCI
IDE controller. Connecting both drives to the onboard IDE controller
under Linux results in the error message "ignoring undecoded slave"
and /dev/hdb is not available to the system.  Fedora kernel 2.6.8-1.521
(based on 2.6.8-rc4-bk3) was among the last to allow the system to boot
with both drives attached to the onboard IDE controller.

Please cc me on any followups.
