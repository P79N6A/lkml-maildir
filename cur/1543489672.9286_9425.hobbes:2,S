The NFS server is, for some reason, returning a different fileid
('inode number') for your file. Usually this happens if the filehandle
goes stale on the server and is reused for a different file. In your
case, however, the filehandle seems to be still valid since it seems
to corrupt the correct file...
What server are you using?
Cheers,
 Trond
