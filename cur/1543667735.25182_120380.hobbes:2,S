-       data = kmalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL);
-       mask = kmalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL);
+       data = kmalloc(size, GFP_ATOMIC);
+       mask = kmalloc(size, GFP_ATOMIC);
        if (cursor->set & FB_CUR_SETSIZE) {
                memset(data, 0xff, size);
irk, you replaced GFP_KERNEL with GFP_ATOMIC, and even unconditionally
memset the return without even bothering to check if it succeeded or
not.
