I am unfortunately holding 2.4.x' earlier history against it. While you
were maintaining it, much of what we're discussing was resolved.
Unfortunately, the stabilization you're talking about was essentially
too late; distros had long-since wildly diverged, they had frozen on
older releases, and the damage to Linux' reputation was already done.
I'm also unaware of major commercial distros (e.g. Red Hat, SuSE) using
2.4.x more recent than 2.4.21 as a baseline, and it's also notable that
one of the largest segments of the commercial userbase I see is using a
distro kernel based on 2.4.9.
