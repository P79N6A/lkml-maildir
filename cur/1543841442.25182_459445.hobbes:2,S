There is no easy solution, particularly with a patch like that one which
splatters itself all over the place.
The best time to do such things is against 2.6.x-rc1, when everyone is
maximally-merged-up.  The worst time is when we're at 2.6.x-rc5, when
everyone is maximally-unmerged-up.
If we're at -rc5 and one doesn't want to wait for a few weeks then one can
work against the -mm lineup, because then when we hit -rc1 and the
subsystems are merged up, the proposed patch will slot in nicely with
minimal breakage: no queue-jumping.
The exception to that rule is patches which move files around.  Because
even a single-line change in one of the affected files will cause the
move-things-around patch to break, and to need somewhat risky rework.  In
that case, simply waiting until -rc1 is the best approach
