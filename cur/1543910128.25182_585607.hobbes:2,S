But. The above regex does not seem to handle
	if ((a = b));
		oops;
I have tried to come up with a superduper regex that handles multiple 
(), but my regex fu seems to stop above two pairs of ().
#!/usr/bin/perl
@check = (
	q"if ((ptr = malloc(bong, GFP)) == NULL)  ; (oopsie) ;",
	q"if ((ptr = malloc(bong, GFP)) == NULL)    (alright);",
	q"if (  ({ bool evil = (true); evil; }) ) ; (oopsie) ;",
	q"if (  ({ bool evil = (true); evil; }) )   (alright);",
	q"if((()));",
);
my $r = qr/\s*\(\s*(??{$r})?\s*\)\s*|\s*\(\s*[^()]+\s*\)\s*/;
foreach (@check) {
	if ($_ =~ /(if|for|while)$r;/) {
		print "ok $_\n";
	}
}
