Yes he can.  The authors licensed the code under _multiple_ licenses
(even if some do not exist yet, which can be amusing, legally), each
of the existing one(s) allowing redistribution if you accept it.  He
does not have to accept _all_ of them to redistribute, _one_ of them
is enough.  And none of them allow to put the code under a different
license, in contrast to say the LGPL.
  OG.
