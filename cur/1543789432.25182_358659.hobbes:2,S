I think this will fix it. 
The naming is horrible, though, and that whole "goal" parameter is 
senseless and ugly.
It should just be a flag on whether we want DMA'able memory or not. That's 
what it _is_, it's just strangely implemented, making the code less 
readable.
Since the patch changes all the users of that third parameter _anyway_, it 
should probably be fixed to just make the parameter sane instead.
