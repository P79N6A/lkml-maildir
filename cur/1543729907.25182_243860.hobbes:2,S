basically yes, but there is one strange thing:
#
# Power management options (ACPI, APM)
#
# CONFIG_PM is not set
#
# ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) Support
#
# CONFIG_ACPI is not set
CONFIG_ACPI_BOOT=y
i don't know where to find the last option in the config programs
(menuconfig, xconfig).  if i comment it manually, it'll get
uncommented as soon as the next make command is issued, regardless
whether make xconfig again, make oldconfig, or make.  it gets reverted
to the above shown state.
i figured out that in stock 2.6.8.1 and 2.6.7-cko5 this option is
enabled, too, (even with the rest of acpi disabled and apm enabled)
maybe i can't see the messages at boot time since they are going to
fast.
