And these restrictions are in the letter of the GPL, not the function
prototypes of my code. Anyone willing to write libgpl-enforcement?
I don't care if someone wants to take my code and blatantly make use of
it in their own projects. I encourage it. I wrote it so people could do
whatever the hell they wanted to with it. It's when that project is made
available to others where I expect the GPL to enforce my copyrights and
licenses. I don't expect my code to be self checking for it, and then
add conditions that this portion of the code cannot be removed, because
then it isn't really GPL anymore, because then it isn't really free
either.
Maybe people will be happy if it ends up like this:
