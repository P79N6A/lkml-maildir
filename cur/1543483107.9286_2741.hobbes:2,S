Would every random person who says "throw XYZ into CVS" _please_ check
out a copy of CVS from Cyclic Software (yes, they have an anonymous CVS
server) and _fix the known bugs in CVS_?  
There are problems in CVS that were documented at least four years ago
(and probably existed years before that) which _still_ have not been
resolved.
	Try checking out a branch revision on a given date.  
	Try _not_ diffing a tagged revision of a removed file.
	Try integrating CVS with a real problem tracking system.
	Try obsoleting an intermediate revision of a binary file 
	(OK, that last one has a reasonable workaround, but it's a real
	surprise to irretrievably corrupt your repository that way...)
If you can get any two of those to happen, you will fix four-year-old
CVS bugs.
