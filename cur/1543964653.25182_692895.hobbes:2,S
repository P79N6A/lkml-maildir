True. Currently, the only dependency is this one:
menuconfig I2C
         tristate "I2C support"
         depends on HAS_IOMEM
HAS_IOMEM is true on every architecture, except usermode linux (um) and 
s390. Also, Multimedia menu is already dependent of HAS_IOMEM, so, this 
currently won't add any extra complexity.
I agree that this may add an extra issue to concern, since future changes 
at I2C dependencies will need to be addressed.
