I've been having a problem lately with about half a dozen machines, all
running 2.2.13 (Slackware 7).
With remote filesystems mounted (using smbmount/smbfs; samba 2.0.5a), I
sometimes
run into a strange crash/race condition.  It [usually] occurs at some
point after the monitor
has been shut off while in X through dpms (and X's OffTime option) - the
keyboard/mouse
lock (or at least, have no effect on bringing the monitor out of dpms).
The machine otherwise
responds fine, aside from the load avg being at 1 (race?  no process was
taking up _any_
of the cpu, according to top), and not being able to kill the smbmount
proc.
The only solution that I've been able to come to is a reboot, which
results in a hang at trying
to 'unmount remote filesystems.'  Am I looking at a kernel/smbfs bug, or
should I direct this
more to the samba folks?
Thanks,
    John
