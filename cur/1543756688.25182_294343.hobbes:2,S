I think there's no difference here between the two techniques.
With the new can_share_swap_page, yes, "page_swapcount" goes up with
the fork, the page will be judged non-exclusive, a user write to
another part of the page will replace it by a copy page, and it's
undefined how much of the I/O will be captured in the copy.
But even with the old can_share_swap_page, and try_to_unmap_one
refusing to unmap the page, copy_page_range's COW checking would
still remove write permission from the pte of an anonymous
page, so a user write to another part of the page would find
raised page_count and replace it by a copy page: same behaviour.
And it's fine for the behaviour to be somewhat undefined in this
peculiar case: the important thing is just that the page must not
be freed and reused while I/O occurs, hence get_user_page raising
the page_count - which I'm _not_ proposing to change!
