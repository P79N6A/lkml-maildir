For me, both 2.6.20-rc6 and 2.6.20-rc7 fails while booting with initramfs 
(initramfs that uses busybox) with "request_module: runaway loop modprobe 
binfmt-0000" error. 
So i modified kmod.c with [1] to get dump_stack, here is the picture taken 
with [2] dump_stack enabled one with description below.
And here is the some observations that i made;
* Booting without an initramfs works,
* Booting with converted initrd from failed initramfs's content works,
* Booting with "Hello world" type initramfs described 
in "Documentation/filesystems/ramfs-rootfs-initramfs.txt" works,
But what is not working is busybox binaries inside the _initramfs_, modifiying 
our init shell script to use staticly linked bash with confirms that, bash 
script interpretted without a problem by staticaly linked bash until 
busybox's mount binary called inside the initramfs.
First i thought somehow busybox is broken but copying initramfs's content into 
initrd works without a problem and also same binaries are working with 2.6.18 
so i think its a regression in kernel but of course im not sure :), if you 
need more information please ask.
