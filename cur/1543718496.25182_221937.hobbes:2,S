Sorry, my mistake. as_io_context is not nicely hidden away at
the moment. I can't remember why, I think it is only needed
for the declaration... I'll look into moving it into as-iosched.c
*But*, io_context is already exported to all elevators and generic
code.

I quite like things how they sit right now. The io_context thing
is quite generic so that is fine... CFQ's cfq_queue is fairly
specialised and trying to make it generic is not a very good idea,
especially as no other elevators would make use of it.
