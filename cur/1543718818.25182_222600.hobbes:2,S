(not sure if this is a duplicate or not.. Apologies in advance.)
I've been tasked with modifying a 2.4 kernel so that a non-root user can
do the following:
Dynamically change the priorities of processes (up and down)
Lock processes in memory
Can change process cpu affinity
Anyone got any ideas about how I could start doing this?  (I'm new to
kernel development, btw.)
Thanks,
