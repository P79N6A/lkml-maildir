How many really need 16?

Let's be a bit more reasonable...
	  0 => 31	USB Serial (Mouse or Modem)
	 32 => 47	USB Printers
	 48 => 63	USB Scanners
	 64 => 79	USB Cameras
	 80 => 95	USB Keyboards
	 96 => 111	USB firmware downloaders
	112 => 239	Reserved for future definition
	240 => 255	USB Experimental
Remember also that the names are reasonably irrelevant, and only the
node numbers actually matter.
Best wishes from Riley.
