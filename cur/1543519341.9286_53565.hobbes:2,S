Subject: [PATCH] Minor sys_umount fix (changes semantics slightly)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here's a one-letter patch for 2.3.x to sys_umount to allow it to
unmount filesystems whose root inode is a symlink.
I'm using such a pseudo-filesystem to support MLS so that you can
divert access to /etc (or whatever) to /etc/foo (or wherever) for
tasks in compartment foo. Without this patch, there's no way to
unmount the filesystem since sys_umount does a namei() which follows
the root inode symlink. Replacing it with lnamei() fixes this (and
barring adding a special umount flag, there's no other way).
However, this changes umount semantics very slightly: currently, with
a 2.2 kernel, if you have a symlink /foo to /some/mountpoint then
umount("/foo") will unmount /some/mountpoint but after this patch
that will no longer work. If this inconveniences anyone greatly,
please scream (but I will then point out that it is impossible to
distinguish the cases in the kernel without an extra umount flag
which would be a horrible wart and even be visible in umount(8)).
