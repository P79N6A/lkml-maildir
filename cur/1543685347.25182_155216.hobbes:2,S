I am going to be working on this feature with a friend starting in
September as a term project (we are both undergrads in computer
science), and a way to get into kernel hacking :) Send me a mail if
you want more info, or if you want us to keep you up to date on
our progress.
We will also be loking for ways to specify the limits in a fairly 
simple, but scalable way, and we will be happy for any suggestions.
