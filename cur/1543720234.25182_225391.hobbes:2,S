>> Run memtest86
Tried once before, didnt boot... died :( memtest page says this happens on
some hardware and they're not sure why.
>> Underclock your system
its not over clocked :/
>> lower IDE DMA mode and see whether it stops oopsing.
tried setting dma = off in hdparm, didnt work, still got crashes compiling
firebird.. infact, it didnt even get passed the ./configure stage :(
Each time (just about, didnt do it once out of 6ish times) i set the dma to
off (either at boot or runtime) i got a "spurious 8259A interript: IRQ 7"..
apparantly, iirc that debug message has been taken out of 2.6.6
Please guys, CC me your responces, otherwise i have to look at some
archives, and reply via webmail... it took 2 firefox crashes (one of which
brought down X) to just right this message... now im going to take a chance
and hit the submit
button
