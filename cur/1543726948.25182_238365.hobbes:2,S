In such schemes, realtime tasks are considered separately from
timesharing tasks. Finding a task to run or migrate proceeds with a
circular search of the portion of the bitmap used for timesharing tasks
after a linear search of that for RT tasks. The list to enqueue a
timesharing task in is just an offset from the fencepost determined by
priority. Dequeueing is supported with a tag for actual array position.
I did this for aperiodic queue rotations, which differs from your SPA.
