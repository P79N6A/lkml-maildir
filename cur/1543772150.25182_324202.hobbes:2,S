I'm still poking around trying to figure out how to disable
CONFIG_ACPI_EC.  Once I get that done, I will post results.  Yeah, I
can't get that to stay unset.  Every time I run make, I end up with it
set to Y, even if I've disabled it before.

In /sys/bus/pnp/drivers/i8042 aux/00:05, resources says "state = active"
in /sys/bus/pnp/devices/*, I have a bunch of directories.  See the
attached "output.txt" for the output of:
(pwd ; for file in * ; do echo $file ; cat $file/resources; echo "" ;
done) > /var/tmp/output.txt
(the same timeouts for AUX, irq 12 are still happening.  and the mouse
doesn't work)
