According to the NAT HOWTO (see www.samba.org/netfilter) a _masqueraded_
connection's table entry will be dropped when the interface goes down.
I assume you use an ISDN dialup (you mention the IP-up script). The problem 
is (I think) that the interface (ippp0) is _NOT_ going down. Only the ISDN
link is, but interface, routing (and NAT entries) are kept 'up' so dynamic
dialling can work. Of course old NAT entries are useless with a new 
connection. 
Probably a solution is to insert 'ifconfig ippp0 down; ifconfig ippp0 up' 
along with a possible 'route -add ...' into your IP-down script.

People with fixed ip-address should use SNAT not MASQUERADE. SNATed entries
aren't dropped.
