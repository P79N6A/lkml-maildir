Not only do I hate the keyword volatile, but the barrier is only a
one-sided affair so its probable this is going to have slightly
different allowed reorderings than a real volatile access.
Also, why would you want to make these insane accessors for atomic_t
types? Just make sure everybody knows the basics of barriers, and they
can apply that knowledge to atomic_t and all other lockless memory
accesses as well.

I like order(x) better, but it's not the most perfect name either.
