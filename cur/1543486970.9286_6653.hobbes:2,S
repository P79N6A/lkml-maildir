I've been seeing strange lockups (including the "2nd half of an oops I
reported earlier) with pre2 and pre5, and I also have an EEPRO100
running on an SMP (dual ppro200). My machine has a relatively light
load, but is on a busy network. I also saw a strange confusion in ppp
connectivity; it was losing packets ~50% of the time, and *very* slow
the rest. I couldn't figure out what exactly was up, and rebooting
fixed it, and it hasn't been back.
Anyway, one more data point for EEPRO100... I'm going to try 2.2.2
tomorrow.
