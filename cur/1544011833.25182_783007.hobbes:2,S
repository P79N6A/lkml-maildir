hm, i think these were all fixed a long time ago, via:
 f6d87f4: genirq: keep affinities set from userspace across free/request_irq()
 612e368: genirq: fix the affinity setting in setup_irq
 6c2e940: x86: apic honour irq affinity which was set in early boot
Kumar, could you please check v2.6.28-rc9 to see whether all issues are 
fixed?
