That was a boilerplate paragraph in all the other vulnerability
reports I shipped out today. Perhaps I should have stripped out out or
replaced it.

Yup the Jenkin's is about 5 times faster than our CW construction on
SPARC, and thus likely at least as much faster on a wide variety of
other CPU's. I do not know if the dcache hash is performance critical,
nor do I know if there exists other more efficient universal hash
functions.
In any case, the attacks I describe are strong in relative terms, but
rather weak in terems of actual impact, so fixing it may not matter
much.

Have you seen the current dcache function?
/* Linux dcache */
#define HASH_3(hi,ho,c)  ho=(hi + (c << 4) + (c >> 4)) * 11
