Subject: [patch 1/1] selinux: fix and cleanup mprotect checks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/19/197

This patch fixes the SELinux mprotect checks on executable mappings so
that they are not re-applied when the mapping is already executable as
well as cleaning up the code.  This avoids a situation where e.g. an
application is prevented from removing PROT_WRITE on an already
executable mapping previously authorized via execmem permission due to
an execmod denial.  Please apply.
