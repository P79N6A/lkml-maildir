Huh?? This is getting absurd. Look at it from my perspective: i spent a 
few spare cycles on a Friday afternoon to check a few x86 relevant 
patches that looked interesting to me personally. At the moment they are 
still cooking in -mm and were not submitted to upstream merging yet - so 
i did not expect anything from them, but i wanted to help out because 
the patches looked good.
This was not any "formal" x86 maintainance activity - your patches are 
still cooking. But i was thinking about maybe putting these patches into 
the x86 test grind to get them shaken out some more the random 1000 
bootup tests a day that it does. When integrating your patches I found a 
bug and tentatively reported it to you, pointing out that it could 
easily be my merge fault. Basically i was offering you to let your 
patches cook in another kitchen as well. I never before had a negative 
response to that :-/
So i expected some "great that you are looking at this stuff, lemme help 
you sort it out, you missed these 2-3 patches in -mm" reaction (that's 
how i'd have reacted to you doing the same) instead i got these very 
surprising and fundamentlly hostile responses from you, an unfriendly 
"test -mm and dont pick out individual patches" suggestion and now this 
mail from you with this rather subtly formulated condescending tone:
> Well I guess you have to get used to maintainership I think. [...]
so i guess i'll leave it here for now with your percpu patches, i've got 
far better things to do on a Friday afternoon :-/ We'll deal with your 
stuff once it gets so far as upstream integration.

huh??? I am really wondering where this hostile attitude of yours comes 
from. Getting patches build and boot is something architecture 
maintainers do on a regular basis, it's a minimum requirement before 
getting something merged into an architecture.
And btw., -rc3-mm2 seems to have grown a spontaneous reboot problem, 
that looks quite similar to what i saw:
  
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.24-rc3/2.6.24-rc3-mm2/announce.txt
| - First bug report: after ten minutes happily compiling kernels my
|   2.6.24-rc3-mm2 x86_64 box spontaneously rebooted.
so from now on i guess i'll have to tag you as "does not want any 
advance testing and review help with his patches" person and will leave 
you alone.
