this code looks like a 'orrible hack to work around a common problem
with USB modem's of this type: if the modem is plugged in while the
system boots, the driver may look for firmware before the filesystem
holding the firmware is mounted; I guess the delay usually gives
the filesystem enough time to be mounted.  I'm told that the correct
solution is to stick the firmware in an initramfs as well.  That's a
pity: it would be nice if users could just dump the firmware in an
appropriate directory and have everything work [*].  As it is, they
also have to regenerate an initramfs.
Ciao,
Duncan.
[*] For legal reasons, users usually have to download and install
the firmware themselves.  For the speedtouch modems I don't know
of any distribution which comes with the firmware preinstalled.
