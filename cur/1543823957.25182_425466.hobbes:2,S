I find that a bit confusing too.  Obviously, we should distinguish
different kinds of bus_id from each other somehow -- but isn't the
obvious thing to use the bus name?  That must already be unique as sysfs
relies on it.  ie this patch:
(seems that dev->bus isn't always set; I got a null ptr dereference when
booting without that check).
