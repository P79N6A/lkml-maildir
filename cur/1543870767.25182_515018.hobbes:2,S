Thanks. As you wrote, I'm planning to write patch based on ZONE_MOVABLE.
I'm now using my own one just because I can't handle too many patches.
My version has a few just-for-cleanup patches. And it may be a bit different
from yours. I'll add cc to you when I post.
It's not ready to send yet...(found some panic at offlining memory ;)

I'm planing to make hot-added memory as ZONE_MOVABLE. I believe we can find and 
move movable pages in ZONE_NOT_MOVABLE to ZONE_MOVABLE.(or kswapd/pageout will
do this in slow way.) The reason is that my first purpose is removing hot-added-memory.
I think I can add knob to choose a zone for hot-added-memory but I won't do it
until someone wants it.

yes.
Note:
We are considering to allocate well-known-structures like mem_map and pgdat
from hot-added memory. We can remove it when a node is unplugged.
But no plan/patches yet.

And kernel on VM, IBM's uses 16MB sparsemem for memory-hotplug, can get
enough benefit. While Xen's baloon driver can do memory-unplug, I heard
it causes memory fragmentation. anti-frag patch will help this.
