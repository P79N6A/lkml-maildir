It is hard to time these, as most of what I do isn't time critical (how can
I time the amount of time it takes to respond to the up arrow in mutt?).
I can clearly see (using ps, vmstat and my HD light) that mutt gets swapped
needlessly (when there is a 6mb cache) out of memory when doing something
slightly memory intensive in another console - any allocation of "a lot" of
memory would trigger this behavior.
I can't really time things, as this isn't what this is about. Interactivity
is (obviously, they are related).

Well, what I'm feeling is unneeded swapping, and what I'm seeing is
something like this:
(This happens when loading something).

If you can suggest a way to do a more accurate metering this behavior - 
please let me know.
