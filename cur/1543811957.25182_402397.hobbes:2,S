 Dear  Friend
I'm happy to inform you about my success in getting those funds transferred  under the cooperation of a new partner from paraguay. Presently i'm in Paraguay for investment projects with my own share of the  total sum. meanwhile,i didn't forget your past efforts and attempts to assist me in transferring those funds despite that it failed us some how. Now contact my secretary in Benin his name is NNA on (nna_maga@myway.com, ask him to send you the total of $800.000.00 
which i kept for your compensation for all the past efforts and attempts to  assist me in this matter. I appreciated your efforts at that time very much. so feel free and get in touched with my secretary Mr NNA and instruct him  where to send the amount to you. Please do let me know immediately you receive it so that we can share the  joy after all the sufferness at that time. in the moment, I'm very busy here  because of the investment projects which me and the new partner are having  at hand, finally, remember that I had forwarded instruction to the
secretary  on your behalf to receive that money, so feel free to get in touch with
MR NNA, he will send the amount to you without any delay.
Regards,
Mr ALEX.
