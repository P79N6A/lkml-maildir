It would help if you told us whether you're using a toolchain which
combines strings across .o files.
Presumably, you're not.  So the space savings which you're seeing
are due to lessening the bloat which is caused by the inline functions
in headers which expand BUG().   Which is what out_of_line_bug() does too.
Assuming the toolchain fixes that for us in 2.5, you've gone and added
zillions of function names to the kernel image.
