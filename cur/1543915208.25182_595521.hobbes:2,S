Of course you can.
What rights do you have to BSD-licenced works, made available
(under BSD) to MS exclusively? You only get the binary object...
You know, this is quite common practice - instead of assigning
copyright, you can grant a BSD-style licence (for some fee,
something like "do what you want but I will do what I want with
my code").

But he may have received only binary program image - or the source
under NDA.
Sure, NDA doesn't cover public information, but BSD doesn't mean public.
Now what?

Sure, the licence covers the >>>entire work<<<, not some "elements".

Of course, that's a very distant thing.

Of course it does. Only author of a (derived) work can licence
it, in this case he/she could change the licence back to BSD,
or sell it to MS (if not based on GPL etc).

Sure you can :-) that doesn't mean it would protect me from Disney,
but you can.

I'm told in the USA use = copying from disk to RAM = distribution,
isn't it true? :-)
It doesn't matter of course.

I don't compare them (though you can). You don't get a licence for
"original elements" in MS-Windows, do you?

Yes, but it isn't automatic. Imagine you have received something
from MS, under more permissive licence (I think such things did
happen). How do you, for example, recognice boundaries of the
elements, IOW what additional rights do you have to each line in
the code or pixel in the font?
The file itself only states:
(C) MS
portions (C) e.g. Bitstream
licenced under their special agreement
What extra rights do you receive from Bitstream? Perhaps you should
ask them if they have given you some licence? :-)
Or another example, redistributable runtime libraries. What extra
rights do you have?
What you write is true for GPL, but it doesn't mean it's true
everytime. It's just that clause in the GPL.
