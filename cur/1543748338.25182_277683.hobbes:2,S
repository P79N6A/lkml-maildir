Greetings,
   I've added support for the IBM 750FX and 750GX Eval Boards
(Chestnut/Buckeye). This patch is against 2.6.10-rc3. The patch relies
on the 2 MV64x60 patches and the EV64260 patch previously posted by M.
Greer. Please apply.
Signed-off-by: Randy Vinson <rvinson@mvista.com>
My patch is over the 40K limit, so it can be found at
ftp://source.mvista.com/pub/rvinson/chestnut.patch
	Thanks
	Randy Vinson
