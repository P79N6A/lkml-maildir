Ah, but 2.2.8-pre4 has some switch_to changes that will almost sure break
IKD.
So now the point is: does the same happen with 2.2.7 ?

In 2.2.8 switch_to get the third parameter. The third parameter basically
is needed only to make sure to still have ebx pointing the "prev" task
before exiting the switch_to asm.
I have not yet tried but I am sure that to fix the asm of the IKD
switch_to we only need to change the numeration of some register (because
it changed their offset adding some additional variable in the
input/output section of the asm).
