lower CPU usage than the *windows* firewall.
While there is a potential gain from a firewall function on the other
side of the PCI bus, this gain is when you reject most packets. Eg you
save "bad" packets from going over the bus. Now the question is how many
bad packets do you get per second...

This is a joke right? In linux at least, the OS doesn't get packets
unless it asks for it; I can't imagine any other OS doing that
differently (since most are somewhat based on the same model). And all
linux distros I know of first install the firewall rules and then tell
the NIC to start receiving packets. In that order. I don't know how
windows does it (and I don't care), but if it gets this wrong it would
be a really bad bug in windows. But I guess it'd give the chipset
marketing people something to boast about ;)
