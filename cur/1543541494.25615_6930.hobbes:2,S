I had thought one simple way of implementing this library would be:-
	open() -> becomes
			tar xzf foo -C /tmp/$UID/foo-$MAGIC
			mv foo .foo-$MAGIC
		 #and possibly..
			ln -s  /tmp/$UID/foo-$MAGIC foo
	close() -> becomes
			rm foo
			if tar czf foo  /tmp/$UID/foo-$MAGIC/* ; then
				rm .foo-$MAGIC;
			# and it's probaly a good idea have..
				rm -rf /tmp/$UID/foo-$MAGIC
			 else
			 	mv .foo-$MAGIC foo;
			        return -ESOMETHING_BAD_THIS_WAY_CAME
			 fi
			
 And I'm sure somthing similiar has been mentioned before.
 
 ISTR People have mentioned Pavel's podfuk in relation to this.
 In any case can someone  implement this or something like it so next time 
 this comes up we can just say use libbar. please.
I've spent 10/12 years  outside of POSIX working with directory's
pretending to be a multi-fork file the way pepole are going on about here.
Trust me, in the long run it is easier, and it does work.

     Think of the mess on the carpet. Sensible people do all their
     demon-summoning in the garage, which you can just hose down afterwards.
