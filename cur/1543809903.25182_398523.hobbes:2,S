in 2.4 the answer would have been simple; modutils back then used
AF_UNIX stuff before it could load modules, so modular was in practice
impossible. 
Anyway I'd agree with making this non-modular... NOBODY will use this as
a module, or if they do loading it somehow is the very first thing done.
You just can't live without this, so making it a module is non-sensical.
