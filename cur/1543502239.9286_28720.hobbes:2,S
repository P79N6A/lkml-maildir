I don't want to trust an all-capable Perl interpreter. Not on a system that
is important/critical enough to be secured by capabilitites. A clean
solution is given if the script carries capabilities, the kernel notes this
and invokes the interpreter with the capabilities the filesystem grants. In
this case it is useless to trick the interpreter.
