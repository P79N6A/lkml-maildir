It may be coincidence, but when I did
  chrt -p -f 99 2
(to set IRQ 0 to max RT priority, like the other IRQ's)
I got the following deadlock.

There are a LOT of messages that stream out after this problem.
I will be sending the full serial console log separately.
Will reboot shortly and see if this is a repeatable problem or not.
