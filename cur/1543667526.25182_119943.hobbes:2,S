Well, there's people here who disagree with tour order.  And yes, making
dev_t larger before making the kernel ready for a large number of devices
is the wrong way around.
If you look at Roman's patches they don't even hinder your dev_t enlargement
but they provide a singificant benefit.   Now I'm personally not yet
completly happy with his interface either because he still uses the
major/minor split, but I'm working on fixing this properly.
