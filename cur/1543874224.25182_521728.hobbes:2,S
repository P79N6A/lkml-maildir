The difference is that the harddrive has an intellegent controller,
which hides all this away. NAND FLASH has not and we have to do it in
software.

Yes, UBI is a kind of LVM for FLASH and we did think quite a time about
reusing LVM before we went the UBI way.

MTD block has no 'smarts' at all. It is a stupid and broken hack, which
you can utilize to lose data and wear your FLASH out.

Should we export block devices with 16/32/64/128 KiB size ? If not, we
would need to put a lot of clever functionality into the mtd block
device code, which we decided to put into UBI, so FLASH aware file
systems can use this shared functionality too.
If someone wants to implement an intellegent mtd block device, which
allows to run arbitrary filesystems, then it should be done on top of
UBI. It's not rocket science, but nobody bothers as we have functional
FLASH filesystems which do their job better w/o any notion of a block
device.
A disk _IS_ fundamentally different to FLASH and all the magic which is
done inside of CF-Cards and USB-Sticks is just hiding this away. Most of
the controller chips in these devices are broken and I would never ever
store any important data on such.
The main points of UBI are:
- wear levelling across the complete device
- background handling of bitflips
- safe updates
- handling of static volumes, which are easily accessible for
bootloaders
Nothing of this is anyway near of LVM and disks. The only LVM alike
feature is dynamic creation/deletion/resizing of volumes.
