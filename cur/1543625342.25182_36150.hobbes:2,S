Here's  a small bug i've discovered yesterday in linux 2.4.18 :
On Linux you can "customize" the default ttl that will be used in all 
the IP packets that the box will be sending ( using 
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_default_ttl ) .
One of the main reasons to do that , as it has been said in many 
articles, is to make your machine  a little bit more difficult to 
fingerprint.
However, while playing with this feature, i've discovered that the 
current kernel ( 2.4.18 ) and probably earlier versions, don't use this 
default value when generating the following packets :
- ICMP reply ( of any kind ) and ICMP error messages
- TCP RST .
They instead use hardcoded values ( MAXTTL ).
 From what i've seen all the other IP packets are using the value set by 
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_default_ttl ( provided that the socket has been 
created after changing the value ).
Therefore, changing the ip_default_ttl on a standard kernel might do the 
opposite of what you're trying to achieve : make it much easier for an 
attacker to fingerprint your os....
By sending a few packets to the target host, you can see wether the 
default ttl has been changed on the machine and therefore enforce other 
findings about the host.
I've written a small patch ( against kernel 2.4.18 ) that fixes this 
behaviour. I'm attaching it to this email.
comments are welcome.
PS : please CC me in replies to this email, i have not subscribed to the
