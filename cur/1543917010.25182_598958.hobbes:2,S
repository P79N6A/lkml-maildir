Subject: [PATCH RESEND] x86_64: make atomic64_t work like atomic_t
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Regardless of the greater controversy about the semantics of atomic_t, I think
we can all agree that atomic_t and atomic64_t should have the same semantics.
This is presently not the case on x86_64, where the volatile keyword was
removed from the declaration of atomic_t, but it was not removed from the
declaration of atomic64_t.  The following patch fixes that inconsistency,
without delving into anything more controversial.
From: Chris Snook <csnook@redhat.com>
The volatile keyword has already been removed from the declaration of atomic_t
on x86_64.  For consistency, remove it from atomic64_t as well.
