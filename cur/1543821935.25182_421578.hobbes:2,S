No.  The caller must not call device_initialise().  They either use
platform_device_alloc() and platform_device_add(), or
platform_device_register().  Same rules apply to these as they
do for device_add() vs device_register().

Just remove the call to device_initialise() in platform_device_add() -
that's something I missed when I renamed platform_device_register to
platform_device_add().
