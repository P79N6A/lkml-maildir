Yes, as I was saying to Linus the rewrite case gets cured by increasing
the writebomb max-segment logic (from the previous 1 to a 4 tunable
per-blockdevice (or per queue in 2.3.x)) and you now given me the confirm
I touched the right bit. Increasing from 4 to 8 should increase a bit more
performance harming a bit more read latency.

Hug, no idea. Maybe I had a silly issue. Strange. OTOH I mainly focused on
2.2.x for now where I can't certainly break lowlevel drivers and I don't
have the request queue exported to the highlevel layer.

Ok. Many thanks for now.

Same here of course. The -4 revision for 2.2.x should be the last one
unless strange problem will arise or somebody will suggest better default
values for the three defines I added at the end of include/linux/blkdev.h
(that are per blockdevice (or per queue in 2.3.x) and each blockdevice can
override during the init function.
