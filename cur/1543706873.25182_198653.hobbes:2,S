And everyone agrees on the epoch and that's why it works.
(just like sensors output is not just any numerical value but has a 
well-defined unit)
With filenames we have a value but what it means exactly is a matter of 
conjecture. That's the problem.
(it wouldn't be if filenames were just magic cookies that never needed 
to be interpreted but there's a lot of actors, be it apps or humans that 
need to agree on what the byte string)
