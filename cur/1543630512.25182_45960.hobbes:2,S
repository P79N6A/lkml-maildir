  Hi, all. Version 199.14 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
Patch directly available from:
ftp://ftp
.??.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rgooch/v2.4/devfs-patch-current.gz
AND:
ftp://ftp.atnf.csiro.au/pub/people/rgooch/linux/kernel-patches/v2.4/devfs-patch-current.gz
This is against 2.4.19-pre8. Highlights of this release:
- Copied macro for error messages from fs/devfs/base.c to
  fs/devfs/util.c and made use of this macro
- Added BKL to <devfs_open> because drivers still need it
- Protected <scan_dir_for_removable> and <get_removable_partition>
  from changing directory contents
				Regards,
					Richard....
