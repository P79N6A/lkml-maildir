Hi Al,
Nice patches!  Ron Minnich <rminnich@lanl.gov> and I built a few similar
things:
- imount is a system call we added.  It implements private namespaces by
combining a "mount without mountpoint" with a chroot operation.  This
allows a user to sit in an "invisible jail" (perhaps Alcatraz would be a
good name.).
- memdev is a new block device, simpler, but similar to Sysv memfs.  It
changes a memory region (such as an mmapped file or device) into a block
device.  With PRIVATE mappings of "/" we built a "jail" where some file
systems became copy on write, backed by swap. Others were mounted as
InterMezzo and gave a "channel" out.
The purpose of this was to provide a user environment that leaves the
machine pretty clean: "Take nothing but cycles, leave nothing but swap
prints" (from the National Park slogan: "Take nothing but pictures, leave
nothing but footprints").
Ron, can you send the code to linux-fsdevel? People might find this
interesting to peruse.
