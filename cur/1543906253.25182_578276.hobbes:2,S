No.

No,

The comment near flush_workqueue() says:
	* We sleep until all works which were queued on entry have been handled,
	* but we are not livelocked by new incoming ones.

Now, again, why do you think this task should wait?

No, I don't think so. Quite opposite, I think sometimes it makes
sense to "offload" some low-priority work from RT99 to workqueue
thread exactly because it has no rt policy.
And what about queue_work() from irq? Why should that work take a
"random" priority?

In that case I think it is better to create a special workqueue
and raise its priority.
