Hello
In trying to help out the issue with the Radeon IGP Chipsets, I have posted 
out the problems that occured on my system.  This is a Readon IGP 320M chip, 
running on a Compaq 900Z.  BTW, these logs don't include loading sound 
driver.  Sound driver cause the my hda, hdc links to timeout, and the hard 
drives are completely inaccesable till i remake kernel without them.

From what I know, usb doesn't work either.
