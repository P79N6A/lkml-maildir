Thanks for sharing the info. I think Amit used a fsx version with
preallocation awareness test, but I don't know if we have other ltp
tests that aware preallocation. I would very appreciate if you could
share your preallocation test with us.

I am not sure, Amit, have you done some mmap write test into
uninitialized extents?
Sorry, I still not quite clear what's the mapped problem you are worry
about. Could you explain to me a bit more? thanks!
