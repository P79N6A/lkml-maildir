: I'm sick of seeing this:
: 
: "Our way is the only way."
: "You must throw out your inferior code. Do not attempt to reuse it."
: "There must not be any possible performance loss, even if you don't care."
: "We write manly code. You write girly code."
: "Everyone must write kick-ass code, whether they need it or not."
: "DSM is a sin. Sinners must repent!"
: "Those that don't use every last cycle are idiots that must be saved."
These are all legit gripes, but here's a question for you:  how should
people let other people know they are going down a rathole?  Or is it
your position that they should just go down the rathole and learn the
hard way, like everyone else did?
While there is a lot to be said for the school of hard knocks, there is 
also the point about "those who don't learn from history are doomed to
repeat it".  So do you really think it is a good idea to learn nothing 
from those who went before you?  You realize, of course, that if we didn't
build on prior work, we'd still be living in caves, killing our food with
sticks, and communicating by grunting  (some might say we are _still_
communicating by grunting :-)
While I agree that it is a real drag to be told "no" and I also agree that
people don't always (usually?) do it in the nicest of ways, I do not agree
that everyone should just go learn for themselves that some things are 
the wrong approach.  If I thought that, then I'd just hire new college 
grads and never be interested in people with experience.  The reason I
want people with experience is usually not for their experience, it is
because they have learned to listen and recognize which approaches aren't
likely to work.
