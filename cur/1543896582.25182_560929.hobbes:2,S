Great, so for ever and ever afterwards the code would have to keep a
clear separation between the bits that are under different licences and
make sure that no re-factor ever blurred the lines between them enough
that you had trouble telling which was which.
And don't even get me started about some poor innocent end-user who just
wants to use some code from your mutant frankenstein "project" in her
pong game (or was it tetris, I lose track of what you're supposed to be
playing on your hacked TiVo while it's not allowed to connect to their
network any more) and understand what licence the final work is under.
Ouch.
