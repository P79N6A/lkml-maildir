Note that this will disable SLAB_RED_ZONE and SLAB_STORE_USER 
for the following SLAB_DEBUG cases:
1. For all slabs if an arch sets ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN > BYTES_PER_WORD
by:
      /* 2) arch mandated alignment: disables debug if necessary */
        if (ralign < ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN) {
                ralign = ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN;
                if (ralign > BYTES_PER_WORD)
                        flags &= ~(SLAB_RED_ZONE | SLAB_STORE_USER);
        }
ralign = BYTES_PER_WORD per your change for slab debug.
ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN > BYTES_PER_WORD -> SLAB_RED_ZONE and SLAB_STORE_USER 
off.
2. For all general (kmalloc) slabs if an arch sets
   ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN > BYTES_PER_WORD
by:
     /* 3) caller mandated alignment: disables debug if necessary */
        if (ralign < align) {
                ralign = align;
                if (ralign > BYTES_PER_WORD)
                        flags &= ~(SLAB_RED_ZONE | SLAB_STORE_USER);
        }
ralign = BYTES_PER_WORD by your change.
align = ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN (passed by kmem_cache_init)
Therefore SLAB_RED_ZONE and SLAB_STORE_USER are always off.
F.e. S/390 will not be able to use slab debug for the general slabs.
You may want to document that change somewhere.
Note that it is not possible to do Redzoning and aligning at the same 
time. Redzoning adds a word before and after the object. If you would 
align it then you would align the whole thing which would result in an 
alignment visible to the slab user of alignment + sizeof(word).
