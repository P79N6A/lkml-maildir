Sounds ugly @) tcp_sequence is already far too complicated.

How about simply queueing the data in that case if it already fits into the
receive buffer? The alternative would be to skb_trim() it to 0 in the slow path
of tcp_sequence and queue, but that looks wasteful.  Basically it would accept
the acks with the data in most cases except when the application has totally 
stopped reading and in that case it doesn't harm to ignore the acks. 
I have been played with a different embedded stack and it uses that 
approach and it seems to work and makes much simpler code.
