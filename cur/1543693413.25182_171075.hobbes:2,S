And how much is that going to cost?  Considering a 2 meg to 8 meg cache
jump costs about 10 dollars nowadays, and includes an upgrade on the
warranty from 1 year to 3 years(which I'm sure is most of the cost
difference), I wouldn't have a problem spending another 10 or so dollars
for that last jump to 32 meg, if performance were to justify it.
