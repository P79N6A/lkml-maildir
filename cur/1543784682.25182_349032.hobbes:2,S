Subject: [PATCH 4/7] kbuild: fix split-include dependency
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/10/144

Splitting of autoconf.h requires that split-include was built before,
and
needs to be-re-done when split-include changes. This dependency was
previously missing. Additionally, since autoconf.h is (suppoosed to
be)
generated as a side effect of executing config targets, include/linux
should be created prior to running the respective sub-make.
