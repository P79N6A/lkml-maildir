Well, why? Sure, MCE exceptions themselves cannot generally printk 
[because they are in essence non-maskable contexts] unless they get a 
fatal MCE [in which case we have no other choice but to try to printk and 
hope for the best]. But they can sprintf into a buffer which then gets 
printk-d (or passed to whatever ASCII based facility).
'struct mce' is pointless complexity and a pointless restriction - and so 
is /dev/mcelog.

Hm, such as? Right now i see mcelog as a facility that gets used only in 
the rarest of circumstances. 99% of the time mcelog is just used in mcelog 
--ascii mode to decode something quirky that the kernel could have (and 
should have) printed out in a much more human-accessible format.

You should not assume that administrators/users reading kernel crash 
messages are dumb. (an ordinary user wont see it most of the time anyway) 
The usage patterns i see is that admins who get an MCE crash often fail to 
write down the whole MCE message (not realizing that it is important) and 
have to go back and reproduce the MCE crash once again before they can get 
any meaningful information.
Printing out cryptic hexadecimal error codes, requiring people to write 
them down and decode them in user-space is the technology of the 80s - i 
didnt think i'd have to argue too much about this ;-)
Reducing the amount of information presented to the user in such a crash 
situation is a dumb idea. (especially here where the MCE information is 
rather dense and single-screen anyway - so there's no screen real estate 
considerations.)

People do care about getting meaningful crash information from the kernel. 
That's why we by default print out something like:
Call Trace:
 [<c013463d>] warn_slowpath+0x6d/0x90
 [<c07a03fb>] ? _spin_lock_irqsave+0x1b/0x60
 [<c07a07fc>] ? _spin_unlock_irqrestore+0x3c/0x60
 [<c07a07fc>] ? _spin_unlock_irqrestore+0x3c/0x60
 [<c015547b>] ? trace_hardirqs_off+0xb/0x10
 [<c079e77c>] ? __mutex_unlock_slowpath+0x9c/0x170
 [<c015fc1c>] smp_call_function_mask+0x1ac/0x1c0
and not:
Call Trace:
 [<c013463d>]
 [<c07a03fb>]
 [<c07a07fc>]
 [<c07a07fc>]
 [<c015547b>]
 [<c079e77c>]
 [<c015fc1c>]
This is a basic principle in the Linux kernel. We try to print out as 
useful information as possible - and only cut down on it if the 
information physically does not fit on the screen. (which is not a problem 
here)
