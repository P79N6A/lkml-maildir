Folks, have you forgotten that you're programmers?
ESR, is it practical to have CML2 transcribe a CML1 config file?
Then as part of the build-the-kernel-src-tarball, Marcelo or whoever's
make target runs the transcriber.
This would let people fetch a kernel and build with the old tools
for personal hacking purposes which keeping the source config in CML2
which is cleans and more powerful. Kernel code _authors_ would need to
write in CML2, but not kernel end users.
