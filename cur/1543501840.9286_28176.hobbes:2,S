From memory - V7 only had one type of special file which is non-standard
by todays standards.  These are multiplexor files which were being
manipulated by the mpx(2) syscall.  They never really did exist on the
V7 filesystem because the V7 fsck considered multiplexor files as
corroupted inodes and deleted them ...  Wasn't the symbol used for them
S_IFMPX?
