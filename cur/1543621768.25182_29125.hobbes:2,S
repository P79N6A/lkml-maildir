I don't have that doc handy, but I'll trust your judgement...

Right.  I still have to do some performance measurements, but I
suspect that as the system size goes up, we'll see the I/O ordering
penalty increase.  It'll probably get noticable at around 64p.

The source level impact should actually be pretty small.  An mmiob()
prior to the spin_unlock in a critical section that does I/O usually
suffices.  Maybe it would be a good idea to have io_spin_lock and
io_spin_unlock for this purpose?
Thanks,
