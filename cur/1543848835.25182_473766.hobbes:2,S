I don't see why overflow couldn't be handle by a syscall telling the kernel 
that the buffer is ready for new events. As mentioned most of the time 
overflow should not happend and if it does the syscall should be amortized 
nicely by the number of events.

As I see it there are two main problems with a mmapped ring buffer (correct me 
if I'm wrong):
1. Overflow.
2. Handle multiple kernel event that only needs one  user event. I.e. multiple 
packet arriving at the same socket. The user should only see one IN event at 
the time he is ready to handle it.
In an earlier post I suggested a scheme that solves these issues. It was based 
on the assumption that kernel and user-space share index variables and can 
read/update them atomically without much overhead. Only in cases where the 
buffer is empty and full system call would be required.
