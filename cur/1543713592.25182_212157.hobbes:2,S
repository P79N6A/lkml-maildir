Subject: [PATCH] ext2fs sb= mount option fix (kernel 2.4.25)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/4/6/67

     The following patch fixes a bug in the processing of the sb=
(alternate superblock) mount option for ext2: for devices with 1024-byte
blocks, the value from the option is never actually used.  This patch is
for kernel 2.4.25.  2.6.5 also has an issue with sb=, and I'll send a patch
for that separately.
