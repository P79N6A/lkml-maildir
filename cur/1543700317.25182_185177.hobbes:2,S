Hi,
I've attached the tarred output of a gnomemeeting run without load and
without distortions and another tarred output of a gnomemeeting run
while compiling a kernel with severe distortions in the audio stream.

What's the railroad to me ?
I never go to see
Where it ends.
It fills a few hollows,
And makes banks for the swallows, 
It sets the sand a-blowing,
And the blackberries a-growing.
