The "rx errors" value is generated by summing 4 error counters from the 
card internal stats structure in airo_read_stats() : 
     RxOverrun, RxPlcpFormatErr, RxPlcpLengthErr and RxMacCrcErr.
Altough my connection is up and running, I also observe a high rate of 
RxMacCrcErr errors :
% grep MacCrc /proc/driver/aironet/eth1/Stats 
RxMacCrcErr: 7688
RxMacCrcOk: 11399
I think that these errors are probably just related to the quality of the 
radio link, and do not reflect something bad, that would occur in the 
driver itself.
Best wishes,
