Subject: [BUG 2.4.21-rc1 and prior] Kernel Panic with vga=791 as bootparam and 1G of ram

Hello all,
after putting another 512mb ram-stick into this machine (It has got 1G of ram
in total now), the VESA framebuffer of 2.4.21-pre7 and 2.4.21-pre7 has stopped
to work. I am not sure whether this problem exists also in prior versions since
i did not test it. However, "has stopped to work" means that as soon as I give
"vga=791" as boot-param, nearly immediately after pressing the enter-key at
grub-prompt, when the kernel should switch into FB-mode, the LEDs on my
keyboard start to blink and it looks as if the machine hangs completely.
With only 512 megabytes of ram, this problem never appeared.
