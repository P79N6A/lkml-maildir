We are always welcome to answer newbie -kernel hacking- questions...
just ask specific ones.  For example, ask "how does struct netdevice's
last_rx member get used?", not "what do I need to do to write a network

The documentation is in linux/Documentation/*

Really.  The code is the best documentation.  Hone your code reading
skills.  Use the source, Luke.
