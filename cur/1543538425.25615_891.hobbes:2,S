Dear All !
Well, I started something, the first result is auto-binding 
the socket in 'spx_connect'.
You can download it from 
http://www.tar.hu/nevemteve/af_spx.c
And I have a question about accepting connections: who should
send ConAck for incoming ConReq? 
'accept' when the user really accepts the connection, or 
the receiving engine, when ConReq arrives... I think this
is would be better...
