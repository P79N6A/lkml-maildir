At the following tree:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/sparc-2.6.17.git
you will find the current Niagara "work in progress" kernel changes
I've been doing.  A lot of it is infrastructure and not directly
related to Niagara per-se, but the hypervisor API and TLB flushing
plus Niagara optimized memcpy is in there.
Andrew, feel free to pull this into -mm as regressions on existing
pre-Niagara systems need to be weeded out as fast as possible.
Folks, if you hit some problem, please test against vanilla 2.6.x GIT
to make sure it really is a new issue and not an already existing one.
I'm interested in the report either way, but it's vitally important to
know if the problem got introduced by the sparc-2.6.17 tree or not.
Thanks.
