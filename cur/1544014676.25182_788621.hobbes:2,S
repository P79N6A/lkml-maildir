I looked memory hotplug code again, then..
 1. stop_machine() is not used.
 2. x86-64 code doesn't have "unmap physical memory from the kernel space".
    (because ia64, my (old) target machine, doesn't need it.)
    I'm not sure about powerpc.
I'd like to look into this for x86-64 when I can. 
BTW, can I make a quiestion ?

"thread" can be obsolete while lock->owner == thread ?
Isn't this depends on  CONFIG_DEBUG_MUTEXES ?
Thanks,
