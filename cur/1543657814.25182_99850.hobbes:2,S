   Hi,
   I've been getting the following error message turn up in my syslogs
at irregular intervals (a couple a week):
Jan  3 06:29:37 vlad kernel: Info fld=0x49c21c, Current sd08:18: sense key Recovered Error
Jan  3 06:29:37 vlad kernel: Additional sense indicates Recovered data without ecc - recommend rewrite
   The Info fld=... value changes.
   Two questions:
 - If I read Documentation/devices.txt correctly, this would appear to
   be the second SCSI disk, second [primary] partition. This is a
   problem, since that partition doesn't exist -- there's a single
   primary partition on that drive, containing 4 logical partitions.
 - Secondly, how can I identify the relevant bit of the disk that
   wants rewriting? Is the fld=0x... the offset on the drive, or the
   partition, or what?
   Thanks,
   Hugo.
