   Think about "memcpy()" and structures (imagine a structure that mixes
   16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit data).
I did think about it pinhead.
64-bit LE user:
struct foo {
       char a;
       short b;
       int c;
       long d;
};
foo.a = 0xab;
foo.b = 0xbcab;
foo.c = 0xcdcdabab;
foo.d = 0xdedededeabababab;
ioctl(fd, XXX, &foo);
64-bit BE kernel:
copy_from_user(kfooptr, ufooptr, sizeof(struct foo));
if(kfooptr->a != 0xab ||
   kfooptr->b != 0xbcab ||
   kfooptr->c != 0xcdcdabab ||
   kfooptr->d != 0xdedededeabababab)
	panic();
It works, I've tried it, have you?
And guess what it even works for sysv ipc shared memory between big
endian and little endian processes.
