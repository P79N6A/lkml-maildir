I would suggest ignoring it. Not only because being overly complicated is 
bad, but simply because nobody should care. 
At some point adding extra regions is _purely_ for "documentation" 
reasons, and while that may be nice, it's not worth worrying about. The 
only thing you really want from a _correctness_ standpoint is to make sure 
that nobody else will try to allocate their stuff in that area, and your 
"BIOS ROM Window" resource should do that already.

It would not be impossible to just have a "force_resource()" that would
simply override _any_ existing resource, but quite frankly, I'd be more
nervous about that.
We could also mark the e820 non-RAM resources with some special
IORESOURCE_TENTATIVE flag, and allow just overriding those. 
But even the simple "insert_resource()" has some potential problems: if 
the BIOS has allocated the minimal window for itself (64kB at 0xffff0000), 
and has allocated some _other_ chip at 0xfffe0000 that the kernel doesn't 
know about yet, your insert_resource() would do the wrong thing and claim 
the whole area for the BIOS writing. 
Maybe that doesn't happen, but it's something to think about.
At some point, the _correct_ answer may be: don't do complex things, and
write a bootable floppy (without any OS at all, or a really minimal one)  
to do BIOS rom updates.
