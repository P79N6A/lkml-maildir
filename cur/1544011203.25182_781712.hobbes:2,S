Posix message queue support in ipc namespaces has had
several submissions by various people.  Hopefully this
version, based on code by both Cedric Le Goater and
Nadia Derbey has a shot at making it upstream.
To create a new ipc namespace with posix mq support, you
would
	unshare(CLONE_NEWIPC|CLONE_NEWNS);
	umount /dev/mqueue
	mount -t mqueue mqueue /dev/mqueue
It's perfectly valid to do vfs operations on files
in another ipc_namespace's /dev/mqueue, but any use
of mq_open(3) and friends will act in your own ipc_ns.
thanks,
