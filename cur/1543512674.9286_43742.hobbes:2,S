     How?
     If /dev/printer/0 will be a PC-style parallel port, and I've
     built the driver as a module, the device has shown up when the
     machine is built, but the driver is sitting there waiting for kmod
     to drag it into core.
     If the file /dev/printer/0 doesn't exist, I can't open it and can't
     tell kmod to load the driver.
     So what I need to do is either discard modules altogether or do a
     speculative load of every driver module in the system at bootup
     so that I can generate the appropriate detect messages for devd
     to populate /dev.    If I have to jump through all of these
     hoops, what do I gain over just populating /dev with every possible
     device?
