Here's some further information.
I have a fully functioning version of rt2x00-2.0.14 and mac80211 from
wireless-2.6/compat-wireless-2.6 of mid January which works fine on
kernel 2.6.24.  On doing a comparison with the rt2x00 in vanilla kernel
2.6.25-rc2, there are no material differences.  (There was a slight
change in the declaration a variable in rt2x00usb.c but it is
immaterial.)
I compiled up the working mid-January version of rt2x00 and mac80211
under kernel 2.6.25-rc2 and I get exactly the same result as I reported
earlier, namely I get a kernel panic as soon as I try to associate.  It
looks therefore as if something has changed within the remainder of the
kernel which has caused rt2x00 (and possibly mac80211?) to break.
This probably explains the problem another user reported with rt61.
