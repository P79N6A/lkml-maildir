This seems to be a fork() bomb, not a VM issue. The system is overwhelmed by
the the forks, not by the space consumed by the allocations themselves. For
one thing, I've found that
main() { while(1) malloc(1024*1024); }
does not kill your system very quickly (if at all). Without actually writing
to the memory, it doesn't seem to be "really" allocated. Adding a memset()
will kill your system much more quickly.
