IMO, giving the new stack full exposure will get us the required input
from developers and users so that a migration schedule can be prepared.

There were also a few enthusiasts who gave the new stack a spin via
patchkits which I used to publish.

Or in short, Kristian has been addressing a number of big TODOs of the
old stack with his reimplementation in a relatively short timeframe,
TODOs which haven't been worked on in the existing stack for years,
literally.  There are also some smaller but effective features in the
new stack like gap count optimization for better asynchronous
throughput, something which I never got around to implement for the
mainline stack because I have been busy with bugfixing and janitorial work.

Actually that's one of the reasons why I started to work on eth1394
recently.

Linus,
the juju branch is branched off v2.6.21-rc3, and it contains a linear
series of 121 commits:
Adrian Bunk (1)
Andrew Morton (4)
Kristian Høgsberg (91)
Marc Butler (1)
Randy Dunlap (1)
Stefan Richter (22)
Thomas Gleixner (1)
If you would rather have it rebased on e.g. 2.6.21 or otherwise
reorganized, or want to have the resulting diff posted for everyone to
look at, I'd gladly do that.
