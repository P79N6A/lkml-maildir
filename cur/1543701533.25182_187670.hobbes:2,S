Old versions of the packet writing code did just that, but Jens told
me that bio splitting was evil, so when the merge_bvec_fn
functionality was added to the kernel, I started to use it.

If merge_bvec_fn is not supposed to be able to handle the need of the
packet writing code, I can certainly resurrect my bio splitting code.
Btw, for some reason, this bug is not triggered when using the UDF
filesystem on a CDRW. I've only seen it with the ext2 filesystem.
