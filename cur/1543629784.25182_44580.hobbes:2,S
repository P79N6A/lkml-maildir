Subject: Has anyone integrated the e1000 driver into the 2.4.x kernel

I am working a project where I need to be able to compile the Intel
e1000 driver into a monolithic kernel, but the readme says that you can
only use the driver as a module.  Is there some technical reason why
this driver cannot be compiled into the kernel instead of being used as
a module?
