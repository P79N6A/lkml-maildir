In Your test You're using at least 16 tasks with an 8 way SMP, so schedule() 
should be always called ( if You're using my test suite tasks are always 
running ).

Hey, this should be the machine I've lost two days ago :^)

Yep, this is the issue.
Why not move scheduling fields in a separate structure with a different 
alignment :
struct s_sched_fields {
 ...
} sched_fields[];
inline struct s_sched_fields * get_sched_fields_ptr(task_struct * ) {
}
This will reduce the probability that scheduling fields will fall onto the 
same cache line.
