It is difficult to quantify either way.  The details are both 
CPU-specific and compiler-specific.  The best information can be culled 
from the gcc list archives, which is where I obtained my knowledge on 
the subject (which is now ~2 years old).
Under the hood, likely() and unlikely() are implemented as percentage 
predictions.  likely() is implemented in the kernel as a 99-100% chance 
of success, and unlikely() is implemented as a 0-1% chance of success.
As such, for our purposes, likely() and unlikely() should only be used 
when a situation is [likely | unlikely] across all runtime 
configurations.  So if you mark a branch unlikely() when it is hit often 
by 1% of your users, that is an incorrect usage.
The effects are probably most dramatic on older CPUs.  Repeatedly 
hitting an unlikely() can cause a pipeline stall on every single access. 
  Branch delay slots are filled improperly, with obvious implications.
But on modern hardware, I would /guess/ that the effect of repeatedly 
hitting an unlikely() would be mitigated by smarter branch prediction.
We really need a GCC expert to answer this question in any more detail.
