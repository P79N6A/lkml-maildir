Nope.  That rule has worked for eons.  Pay close attention to the
syntax:  It uses "TO" and not "To" which is completely different.
The "TO" is a special procmail macro, and this recipe was
constructed with care from the procmail documentation.

No, the "TO" macro catches all of that.  You're probably just not
familiar with procmail's special macros.  I've used "TOmailinglist"
on several lists with no trouble at all.
Just so you don't have to hunt through docs, here is the
documentation on the "TO" macro which is from the procmailrc
manpage:
MISCELLANEOUS
       If the regular expression contains `^TO' it will  be  sub-
       stituted by `(^((Original-)?(Resent-)?(To|Cc|Bcc)|(X-
       Envelope|Apparently(-Resent)?)-To):(.*[^a-zA-Z])?)', which
       should catch all destination specifications.
So you can see, it covers all the cases that you mention, and
many more.  It is fantastic for nailing a list down easily.
Take care!
