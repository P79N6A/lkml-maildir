This is a different issue from the ones that relates to lock_cpu_hotplug().
This one seems like a cpufreq internal locking problem.
On a quick look at this, it seems to me that cpufreq_cpu_get() should
do exactly what you said - use a spinlock in each cpufreq_cpu_data[] to
protect the per-cpu flag and in cpufreq_cpu_get() check if
!data and data->online == 0. They may have to do - 
static struct cpufreq_data {
	spinlock_t lock;
	int flag;
	struct cpufreq_policy *policy;
} cpufreq_cpu_data[NR_CPUS];
Thanks
