Subject: [RFC][PATCH] adding '(BROKEN)' to items in make {,menu,x}config
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi out there!
Is it just me or is the frequency of 'my fat.o has an undef'ed ref to
vm_update_cache' postings increasing?
To limit such posts in the future, I wrote a little patch that simply
tells people that do at least their make *config with open eyes "this FS
is broken and will not compile". It's nothing big, but it will save the
list a few posts per day :-)
Patch is against 2.3.11.
Comments, flames?
Marc
PS: I attached the file instead of incluing it plainly in the message
body, fearing that the linewrap will be destroyed by my mailer.
