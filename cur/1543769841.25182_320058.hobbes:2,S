The point of libgcc is that it is *linked in* to generated programs, and
thus under the FSF's interpretation might force those programs to be
covered by the GPL. Hence the exception, to make it clear that this is
not the case.
(It is even more necessary for the libstdc++ headers and Ada runtime,
as they are respectively textually included and included in cross-module
inlining...)

Nah, it's not that simple: apparently he flames them, too. I think we
can safely say he is no-one's pansy. (Now he might be impossible to
please, but that's a different matter.)
