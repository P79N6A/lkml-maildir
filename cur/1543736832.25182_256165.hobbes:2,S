Hi all,
I managed to (hopefully) fix an kernel Oops on rmmod usb-storage.
The Oops we got was something like:
usbcore: deregistering driver usb-storage
scsi: Device offlined - not ready after error recovery: host 0 channel 0 
id 0 lun 0
sr 0:0:0:0: Illegal state transition cancel->offline
Badness in scsi_device_set_state at drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:1688
  [<e12bab6e>] scsi_device_set_state+0x9e/0xd0 [scsi_mod]
  [<e12b8a6e>] scsi_eh_offline_sdevs+0x4e/0x70 [scsi_mod]
  [<e12b8f1a>] scsi_unjam_host+0x9a/0x1b0 [scsi_mod]
  [<e12b90f5>] scsi_error_handler+0xc5/0x160 [scsi_mod]
  [<e12b9030>] scsi_error_handler+0x0/0x160 [scsi_mod]
  [<c0104255>] kernel_thread_helper+0x5/0x10
It turned out that in drivers/scsi/hosts.c:scsi_remove_host()
first the host is removed with scsi_forget_host() and _then_ all 
outstanding I/O to this host is cancelled with scsi_host_cancel(). 
Sounds a bit fishy as scsi_host_cancel() tries to talk to a host which 
we just have deleted ...
(Incidentally, this is most likely the same bug as Bug #2752 and #3480 
from bugme.osdl.org :-).
(And also #133249 from bugzilla.redhat.com :-).
The attached patch corrects this.
Please apply.
Cheers,
Hannes
