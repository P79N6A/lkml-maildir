Which is a good thing since we want the pre-patches to
be tested in their original version by as many people
as possible...

The < --> <= change should not cost anything on most
architectures and reduces the pressure a nice +19 task
puts on the system.        It should go in immediately.
The current->counter = 0; trick is not needed anymore.
We've had SCHED_YIELD for ages and we're doing a timeout
anyway...                  Another candidate for inclusion.

Probably not. Artificially setting current->counter to 0
is very unfair and can be bad for the system's interactive
feel. We should use SCHED_YIELD in this case.
