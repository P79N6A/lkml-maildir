Hi,
The attached patch is based on Jan Frey's previous patch posted in 2004
for the Linux 2.4 kernel. It has been tested on X86 and MIPS platforms.
If the core pattern doesn't end in ".gz" it will be added to the name of
the core file. It's offered under GPL v2 without any warranties. If you
have any questions, please contact me directly at Mano.Pallewatta "at"
motorola.com. 
Regards,
Methlal (Mano) Pallewatta
