Wait a minute. First of all, reread the subscribed part. Now, while *some*
requirements of POSIX are, IMHO, mandatory for any fs (too many programs
depend on them) this particular one shouldn't affect VFAT in any way -
there is no links, to start with.
	Considering names that differ only in capitalization as links is
dead wrong - we can't deal with links to directories. We went through that
several times. If you have a solution that allows multiple dentries for a
directory - tell it. And let me poke some holes in it, OK? So far I've
seen *no* variant that would allow this thing and wouldn't give us fs
corruption. Yup, old driver had such holes.
	So far I'm convinced that the only way to allow such renames is to
change lookup() semantics for rename() target. It affects the whole
fs/namei.c and fs/dcache.c, but at least it can be done. We already have
races around lookup() and while they have no fs corruption potential now
they *will* get it if we'll just go ahead and add a new flag for lookup,
make vfat_lookup() keep the thing unhashed, etc.
