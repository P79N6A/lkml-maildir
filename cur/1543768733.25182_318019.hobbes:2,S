I just tried it, it doesn't give me any errors.  This is strange considering
that I a) use a pristine tree for each kernel (only coping the .config) and
b) the patch doesn't do anything except report the error.  I made my boot
floppy (the scripts I use pull from the kernel tree I specify and make the
image I need) and booted from it.  I placed the modules on my stage2 disk
that was made and it works.
I don't have the time this week to try again from scratch.  I'll see if I
can do it next week.
