Yup, I have one of those in my arsenal and see the same thing.

I have reports of APC UPS remote wakeup working properly on "recent" 
PowerMac G5s running OS X, but was never able to duplicate that success 
on my cruddy old G3. I never figured out if it was a deficiency of the 
UPS, the G3, or the OS. So it is possible that with appropriate OS 
support this feature may actually work on certain UPSes (APC has a habit 
of messing up the firmware differently on each model, so it's likely 
hit-or-miss, but they are improving).
