hello
line-in on my audigy platinum is dead. i can see it in the mixer, modify the volume,
mute/unmute....but w/o any effect. it remains dead. line-in2 on the 'drive' works
fine, but no mute/unmute there...oh and no capture for linein1 (not that i would
care, since it's for my tv-card)
kernel is 2.6.3-rc1-bk.
ideas, patches?
thx
-daniel
