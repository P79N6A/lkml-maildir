My experience is running _modified_ 2.4 kernels. Turning HT off solved 
the problem here. Of course YMMV if the root cause is different.
I have no experience of running HT on 2.6. My hunch would be that more 
HT users run 2.6 than 2.4 nowadays, so the problem would've been raised 
by now? If so your choice depends on whether the joint benefits of HT 
and of 2.6 outweigh any effort of moving to 2.6.
