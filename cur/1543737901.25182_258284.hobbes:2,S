Heh, Red Hat 9 is quite old now (a few years old I think.)  Try the
latest Red Hat Fedora Core 2 for a more up to date distro if you like to
use Red Hat.

So, it's a card, not a PCI bus controller, right?  That's much simpler.

What's wrong with using readl() instead?  Use pci_read_config_dword() if
you want access to the config space.

Try getting a copy of the Linux Device Drivers book (it's also online if
you don't want to buy it) and taking a look at the pci chapter.  It
should help you out.
Do you have a pointer to your Linux driver that we might be able to help
you out with?
Good luck,
