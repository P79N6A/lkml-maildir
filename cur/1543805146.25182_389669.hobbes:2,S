cdrecord simply assumes that if you don't have access to /dev/hda,
scanning the other devices is pointless, on the assumption it were a
security risk. How this fits into user profiles that might allow access
to /dev/hdc, is unclear to me.

/dev/hd* and ATA: support DMA, newer cdrecord versions actually check
the DMA speed before starting write operations without burnproof.

Locking pages in memory so they aren't swapped out (a requirement for
real-time applications) -- that's the original reason for my
RLIMIT_MEMLOCK question that preceded this thread.

That's less of a problem than sending vendor-specific commands - one
might be "update firmware", which would allow the user to destroy the
drive.

There are some things to complicate matters. SUSE patch subfs into the
kernel and ship the needed user-space, think of this as quick
automounter. It releases the drive and unmounts the medium when the last
file is closed. In older SUSE releases, tty? logins didn't trigger
such access controls, only "desktop" logins through kdm or gdm.

What matters is sg, and perhaps sr.
