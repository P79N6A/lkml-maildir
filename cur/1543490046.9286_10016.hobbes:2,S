Your delta_usec is in fact a lost_ticks. The name is confusing when 
you add microseconds to jiffies. (IMHO)

This way the system time will be more behind than before if
"(1000000 % HZ) >= HZ/2". IMHO the line is correct. After all we are 
not saying "(1000000 + HZ - 1) / HZ".

Simply removing variables that other people might need isn´t a very 
good idea.

I could NOT confirm loosing time; I only saw some jitter.
