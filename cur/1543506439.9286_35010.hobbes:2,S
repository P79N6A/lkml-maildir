Yes I think you are right and the True64 people misinterpreted the
call. This is the reason why I proposed another flag.

Yes that's right. We need this for shared pages, i.e. SYSV shm.

You can not use file descriptors for shared memory since they sync to
file on unmap. This would be possible if we had shm_open which
implements shared memory with the normal fd/mmap/unmap syntax.
Also we are not able to change the general implementation of the R/3
kernel, but have to choose between several given options.
