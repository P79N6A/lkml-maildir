... with dire implications if you fail to kill after grabbing or are
evil-minded.
What about a much simpler solution:
 - make PIDs very long (e.g. 32 bits)
 - only expose 15 bits, as we do now
 - make sure PIDs are unique within the lower 15 bits (otherwise,
   programs using 15 bit PIDs would see duplicate processes)
 - start counting PIDs at a value >= 32768
 - include the full PID somewhere in /proc/<PID>/stat
 - change the kill system call such that it looks for
   process->pid == pid if pid >> 15, or
   !((process->pid ^ pid) & 0x7fff) PID & 0x7fff otherwise
 - extend programs like killall and fuser to use the long PID from
   stat
 - use only those programs for killing (extending the normal ps and
   kill would of course be trivial, too)
If you put the kernel side of all this into 2.3/2.4, I'll make the
necessary extension to killall and fuser. Do we have a deal ? ;-)
