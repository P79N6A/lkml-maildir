Its maxtor with dma-anything on hpt366, whether it's "classic dma", udma33
or udma66.
It's harder, but you can even lock the system using pio mode on hpt366
with cdrom... evil.
Andre has told me that the hpt366 timing is just plain wrong for CDROM
devices, and timing with maxtors is off enough to cause problems.
In the end, I gave up on hpt366 and bought a pdc20262 instead... works
fine with udma maxtors and cdroms...
