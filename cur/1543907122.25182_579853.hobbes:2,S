Well there is an -h variable:
# Don't shut down drives if we're using RAID.
	hddown="-h"
	if grep -qs '^md.*active' /proc/mdstat
	then
		hddown=""
	fi
....
log_action_msg "Will now halt"
	halt -d -f $netdown $poweroff $hddown
However removing it has no effect, the drive still spins down two times.
Sidux is a Debian Unstable based distro with it's own set of patches
including the shut down patch provided here:
