I don't like this, it doesn't make much sense to me to special-case this 
with some "module .sanity thing".
Instead, why don't you make _every_ object file just contain some magic
section (link-once), and then at module load time you compare the contents
of the section with the kernel magic section.
That magic section can then be arbitrary, with no strange bitmap 
limitations etc.
