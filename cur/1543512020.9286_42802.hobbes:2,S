Your assertion implies that the devfs_* calls to register a device will
act differently in registering nodes for driver A as apposed to driver
B.
Even while this assertion has validity, you are not forced to support
devfs with your driver. Chances are, someone could add the plus or
minus 10 lines of code for you.
Devfs is not bit twiddling like actual driver writing. It's a pretty
darn simple thing to support. Dont make it out to be harder than it is.
