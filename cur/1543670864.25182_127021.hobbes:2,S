I just returned from vacation yesterday.  So the kbugs.org 
update is a bit late.
The notable thing this release is the update to the UnFree 
script.  Credit for that goes to Oleg Drokin.  Apparently I 
screwed the script up with one of my merges.
For the 2.5.67 results there was a bug in the ifcond.pm 
module and that is why the Dereference and UnFree bug count 
was higher than it should have been.  There are still problems 
remaining with ifcond.pm which may be causing false positives 
in the Dereference and UnFree checks.
