Well this is a depressing saga.  A bunch of people whose machines appear to
be spending 50% CPU time in softirq processing.  Some find that `noapic'
fixes it and some dont.  Some are on x86_64, some are on x86.
I suspect we have multiple bugs here.  It's quite a mess.
Could the reporters please, via a reply-to-all to this email:
a) test 2.6.14.
b) summarise the current status of your bug (what CPU type, what are the
   symptoms, any known workarounds, etc).
c) Generate a kernel profile (see Documentation/basic_profiling.txt)
Generally, let's get a bit of action happening here and see if we can get
these relatively long-standing regressions fixed up, thanks.
