Hello all,
   I am not sure this is a kernel problem, but I have not heard of anything
else causing these symptoms.  I have had my Linux system running on the same
setup for a while without any problems. Now since the addition of new
hardware I have had problems with sound and cpu load.
Setup:
    AMD-k62 300Mhz
    64MB of RAM
    CREATIVE48x CDROM
    Linux kernel 2.2.13
    Voodoo3 2000 PCI (replaced a 2MB Trident card)
    Onboard ISA PNP SoundBlaster 16 compatible
    X 3.3.5
When the sound module is installed this is the message it logs:
  Nov 20 08:23:22 peabrain kernel: SB 4.13 detected OK (220) 
  Nov 20 08:23:22 peabrain kernel: sb: Interrupt test on IRQ5 failed - 
   Probable IRQ conflict
The sound works, but it is patchy and the CPU utilization hovers at over 3%
even when the computer is mostly idle (normal CPU was under 1% when mostly
idle before upgrade)
If anyone could help me troubleshoot this, I would be grateful
Thanks in advance,
--Erico.
