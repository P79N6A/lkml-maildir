No, it doesn't, because some way of knowing the disk load is required and 
there's nothing like that here.
There are two components to what I was talking about:
  1) Early flush when load is light
  2) Preemptive cleaning when load is light
Both are supposed to be triggered by other disk activity, swapout or file 
writes, and are supposed to be triggered when the disk activity eases up.
