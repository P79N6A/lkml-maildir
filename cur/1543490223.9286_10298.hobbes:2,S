Good afternoon,
I have received quite nice feedback (see ChangeLog) for -pre1.
A couple of bugs were found and promptly stomped to death.
Apart from silly fixes, I have made some changes to meta_expand.
I still don't know if I handle wordexp() correctly, and there might
be improvements to be found in the globbing attempts in general.
Everything is available via anon cvs:
	export CVSROOT=':pserver:anonymous@cvs.on.openprojects.net:/cvs/linux'
	cvs login	# Just press <ENTER>
	cvs -z3 checkout modutils
or, as usual via http (I have put a patch for -pre1 there as well):
	<
http://www.pi.se/blox/modutils/>
I will look at some of the patches I have received but not yet integrated
(yes Alon, I haven't done it yet...), but that's about it, except testing!
Alpha, egcs and libc2.1 can only be tested by you, so keep it up!
