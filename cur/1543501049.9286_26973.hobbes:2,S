We may be interested in supplying the test setup for a limited time (2
months?), as we already have a large percentage of the hardware needed; it
all depends upon how much interest there is.
This would also be a prime opportunity for Linux-friendly hardware vendors
(of disk drives, RAID controllers, etc.) for exposure from sponsorship, so
we might want to leverage this, as well.
