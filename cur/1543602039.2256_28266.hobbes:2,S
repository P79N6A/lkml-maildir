I think we are talking about somewhat different things. U talk about
swapping in general. I talk about the changes 2.4.7 > now (2.4.9 for
example) in the VM system that makes linux to swap alot.
In kernel 2.4.7 maybe 5 Mbyte was put on the swap over a week. It didnt
had any need to put more on the swap because i got 512 Mbyte RAM.
Then that changed... In for example 2.4.9 it put ALOT of Mbyte on the swap
very fast, like 100-200 Mbyte. And then it will slowly swap it back to RAM
when they are needed. If it didnt put it on the swap in the first place and
keept it in RAM like under 2.4.7 it would not swap it back to RAM later and
it would go faster. I know alot of others that are very annoyed about this
and is complaing about it. I just doesnt reach the linux-kernel
mailinglist.
