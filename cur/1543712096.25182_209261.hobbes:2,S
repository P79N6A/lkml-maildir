gzip is useless for almost everyone -> gets little testing -> is

Kernel could automagically select the right one.. But I'd prefer for
only "non compressed" part to reach mainline for 2.6. Feature freeze
was few months ago, and "adding possibility to compress swsusp data"
does not sound like a bugfix to me...
