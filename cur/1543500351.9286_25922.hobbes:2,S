	I've added the printk:
Jun 24 14:57:10 Cnn kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device
Jun 24 14:57:10 Cnn kernel: 03:01: rw=0, want=656811301, limit=2015968
Jun 24 14:57:10 Cnn kernel: dev 03:01 blksize=1024 blocknr=656811300 sector=1313622600 size=1024 count=1
	the numbers look ok - b_blocknr is too large.
	this happens with:
		- kernel 2.3.9-pre1 (also with 2.3.8-pre2, 2.3.8)
		- ide drive (03:01), ext2 root partition (not fat)
[root@Cnn]:bonnie/:# ./bonnie
File './Bonnie.893', size: 104857600
Writing with putc()...done
Rewriting...^C
	as soon as bonnie gets to the `rewriting' part the errors appear.
