Is this really absolutely necessary? I have SYSENTER based syscalls
mostly working, cutting the cost of a system call in half (currently
from 281 cycles for a int80 based getpid to only 137, but the numbers
will change a little as i finish it off). Supporting six args is not
really an option however (not w/o extra kernel side translations --
there are simply no registers left to pass the required info
(esp/eip))..
