Subject: [PATCH 5/6][v5] Protect cinit from blocked fatal signals
Normally SIG_DFL signals to global and container-init are dropped early.
But if a signal is blocked when it is posted, we cannot drop the signal
since the receiver may install a handler before unblocking the signal.
Once this signal is queued however, the receiver container-init has
no way of knowing if the signal was sent from an ancestor or descendant
namespace.  This patch ensures that contianer-init drops all SIG_DFL
signals in get_signal_to_deliver() except SIGKILL/SIGSTOP.
If SIGSTOP/SIGKILL originate from a descendant of container-init they
are never queued (i.e dropped in sig_ignored() in an earler patch).
If SIGSTOP/SIGKILL originate from parent namespace, the signal is queued
and container-init processes the signal.
And now that we have all pieces in place, set SIGNAL_UNKILLABLE for
container-inits.
Changelog[v5]:
	- (Oleg Nesterov) Drop signal_unkillable(), simplify check in
	  get_signal_to_deliver() and drop check for signal_group_exit()
	  since it is covered by sig_kernel_only().
Changelog[v4]:
	- Rename sig_unkillable() to unkillable_by_sig()
	- Remove SIGNAL_UNKILLABLE_FROM_NS flag and simplify (Oleg Nesterov)
	- Set SIGNAL_UNKILLABLE for container-init in this patch.
