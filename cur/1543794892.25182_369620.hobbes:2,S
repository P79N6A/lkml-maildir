What is your point?  I personally couldn't care less about POSIX (or any 
other simillarly old-fashioned standards for that matter).  What counts is 
reality and having a working system that does what I want/need it to do.  
If that means violating POSIX, so be it.  I am not going to burry my head 
in the sand just because POSIX says "you can't do that".  Utilities can be 
taught to work with the system instead of blindly following standards.  
And anyway the Linux kernel defies POSIX left, right, and centre so if you 
care that much you ought to be off fixing all those violations...  (-;
