Well, but that has nothing to do with the _calling_ convention.
That looks to be a totally internal bug to within e820_all_mapped().
I agree that the calling convention change would avoid the overflow 
internally too, I just don't much like the explanation (and not 
necessarily that it affects the caller, who doesn't much care).
