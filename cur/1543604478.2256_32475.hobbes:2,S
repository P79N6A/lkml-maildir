Somebody on this list posted a rather clean solution: there is a
"showexec"-flag for MS-filesystems, which shows only files .exe, .com or
.bat extensions as executable. This is a better thing than to play with
umask I think. Umask will give problems with wine and (maybe) dosemu.

Microsoft is not the solution, it is the problem.
