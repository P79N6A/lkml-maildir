I'd like to create and send a brand new TCP SYN packet from a module. 
Does anybody have an example of how to do this.
I've tried doing alloc_skb, filling in all the information I could
imagine needing in skb->data, but what is the minimal amount of stuff
needed by the other parts of the skb to get this packet moving?
Is there an easy way to create and own a TCP socket from a module that I
could send and receive on?
Thanks,
	Josh
