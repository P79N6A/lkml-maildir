this later phenomenon is expected and unrelated: printk-ing to the
console (as the ALSA xrun kernel message does) is quite expensive,
especially with a full stack dump included. So this fact alone doesnt
tell us much about why the xrun itself happened.
if there is no preempt-timing report when the ALSA xrun debugging is
disabled it strongly suggests that whatever causes the xrun, it's not
due to the length of a non-preemptible critical section, but some other
phenomenon (either in userspace or in kernelspace) that causes an xrun.
irqs being left disabled by accident is one such possibility - the
preempt-timing patch does not (yet) track irqs-off sections.

either jack's or the kernel's - but it's less likely to be the classical
non-preemptible sections we were focused on so far. (it could still be a
bug in the preempt-timing patch producing a false negative - but the
likelyhood is low i'd say.)
