The approach I am on currently doesnt deal with dynamically loaded
modules ..Partly because it allows subsystem ids to be compile-time
decided and also init_nsproxy.ctlr_data[] can be initialised to default
values at compile time itself.
For ex: init_nsproxy.ctlr_data[CPUSET_ID] can be set to &top_cpuset
at compile time.
If there is demand later, I agree we need to address the shortcoming you
point out ..

We have been thr' this in a diff thread. I trust we have discussed all
that need to be discussed here?

Ok ..by posting rcfs patches, I didn't mean to introduce a "yours" and
"mine" rift ..honestly.  In fact you would notice that they have your
(sole) copyright still on them! It took me just two days to convert over the
patches to use nsproxy and come up with the rcfs patches and obviously I
couldnt have done that without your excellent patches to start with.
So if there is is larger interest in using nsproxy at some point, I hope
they serve as some reference patches to do the conversion. I would go ahead
and post what I have now (which incorporates several bug fixes) which 
could be used as you deem necessary at a later point if/when considering 
moving to nsproxy.

I agree that is not a big issue now (considering there are larger things
to go after!).

I am still trying to come to terms with this null groupings and how they
would be used in real life.
	- Can you list a real world use of it?
	- If they are "inescapable" task groups, how does the first task enter
	  such a group, using just the filesystem interface?
	- If there is no real kernel use for such groups, can this be
	  implemented in userspace (user ids, session ids etc)
	- If userspace soln is not feasible, why would you want such null
	  groupings in multiple hierarchies and not in one hierarchy?
	  If having them in one hierarchy satisfies the requirements,
	  then we could create empty cpusets at top level (or at an 
	  appropriate subcpuset level) and use them as null groups?
	  By defining permissionss of the null-group cpuset directories,
   	  we could restrict movement of tasks across groups ?
