Nick seemed to me to be objecting to vfree() being involved, and
Manfred's patch does not do vfree().  Hence "avoid" rather than "fix".

And one would indeed either need to have a vfree_atomic() or have some
mechanism that sent the vfree() to a workqueue or some such.
In any case, I do apologize -- since I didn't see anything from you I
incorrectly assumed that you had given up on this patch.  Please accept
my apologies!
Would it be possible for you and Manfred to agree on a common patch, and
to have one of you submit it with both of you having Signed-off-by on it?
							Thanx, Paul
