I am not arguing whether all processes will be frozen. However my question was 
on the freeze point. Let me ask the question with an example:
rtasd thread (arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries/rtasd.c) executes this simple
loop:
static int rtasd(void *unused)
{
	i = first_cpu(cpu_online_map);
	while (1) {
		set_cpus_allowed(current, cpumask_of_cpu(i));	/* can block */
		/* we should now be running on cpu i */
		do_something_on_a_cpu(i);
		
		/* sleep for some time */
		i = next_cpu(cpu, cpu_online_map);
	}
}
This thread makes absolutely -no- calls to try_to_freeze() in its lifetime.
1. Does this mean that the thread can't be frozen? (lets say that the
   thread's PF_NOFREEZE is not set)
   AFAICS it can still be frozen by sending it a signal and have the signal 
   delivery code call try_to_freeze() ..
2. If the thread can be frozen at any arbitrary point of its execution, then I 
   dont see what prevents cpu_online_map from changing under the feet of rtasd 
   thread, 
 
    In other words, we would have failed to provide the ability to *block* 
    hotplug operations from happening concurrently.

*forced*, yes ..that's the point of concern ..
