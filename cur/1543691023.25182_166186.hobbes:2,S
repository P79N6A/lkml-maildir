Subject: 2.6.0-test4 consumes more power than 2.4?

Hi.
While reviewing 2.6 on my laptop, I noticed something
very odd.  Average power consumption is about
200 mA higher compared to 2.4.
I measure this via the /proc/acpi/battery/*/state interface.
Under 2.4, when idle my laptop consumes about
720mA, sometimes even below that.
Under 2.6, the average idle power consumption is about
900mA.
iN both kernels, I have set Performance state 1
(400mhz) before measuring the average power consumption.
Can anyone confirm this observation?
If so, what is causing this?  200mA is quite a lot of difference,
and if this is a true measurement (no ACPI bug),
this might be a serious problem for laptop users.
