Hi!
x60 shut down after quite a while of uptime, in period of quite heavy
load:
Sep  4 23:33:01 amd kernel: ACPI: Critical trip point
Sep  4 23:33:01 amd kernel: Critical temperature reached (128 C), shutting down.
Sep  4 23:33:01 amd shutdown[32585]: shutting down for system halt
Sep  4 23:34:42 amd init: Switching to runlevel: 0
I do not think cpu reached 128C, as I still have my machine... Did
anyone else see that?
									Pavel
