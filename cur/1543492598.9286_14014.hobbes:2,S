I don't see the problem. A suid-root binary is immutable for everyone
but root. Only root can grant capabilities. If some user is allowed to
create binaries with privileged port access, then they just need to
run a privileged binary which adds CAP_PORT to the binary.
The mechanism is that the cap header is created/modified, the owner is
changed to root and the suid bit is set.
No problems. Much safer than overloading the sticky bit, since access
to the sticky bit is not universally restricted, which is a major
security hole. On the other hand, access to root-owned files is
universally restricted.
