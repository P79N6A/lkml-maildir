should apt-get install oprofile then opcontrol --setup
--vmlinux=/boot/vmlinux --ctr0-count=20000
--ctr0-event=CPU_CLK_UNHALTED && opcontrol --start
do the trick? If that works does it mean oprofile is okay?

oprofile() should already have checks to prevent that, and I added one
[        if (nmi_watchdog == NMI_LOCAL_APIC)
]
to nmi.c. I hope that's okay.
