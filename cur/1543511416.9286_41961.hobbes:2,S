Sounds like a good idea. SO_ORIGINAL_DST should be an integral part
of networking with some hooks for netfilter/nat, and on the long term
the kernel could have the generic register sockopt hooks.

The old transparent proxy returned the original destination address in
the unused part of sockaddr_in in accept for TCP sockets. In case of UDP
it returned it in the sockaddr_in passed from recvmsg per packet. For the
TCP case this should be replaced with SO_ORIGINAL_DST, for UDP sockets
SO_ORIGINAL_DST can be implemented for connected sockets, for the generic
case it is cleanest to replace it with a IP control message that can be
passed in msg->msg_control.
