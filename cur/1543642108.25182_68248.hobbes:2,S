I expect things to break, get fixed, and break again in a development 
series.  I've seen it in the 2.1, 2.3 as well as 2.5.  I expect it to 
smooth out once feature freeze happens.
I've compiled many a 2.5 kernel as you can imagine and didn't get bit by 
the keyboard thing until this weekend.  The weird part is that after it 
happened it took a make mrproper, followed by a recompile with the exact 
same options to bring it back.  There is definitely something going on in 
the make system.  In any case, following is the relevant parts of .config 
which work for me:
