Subject: any value in centralizing common 32/64 x86 content in vmlinux.lds.S?

  given the amount of common content between
arch/x86/kernel/vmlinux_32.lds.S and arch/x86/kernel/vmlinux_64.lds.S,
what about just defining macros for some of that stuff in
arch/x86/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S and cutting down on all the duplication?
  as is done in include/asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.S, why not just
define some handy macros, like:
#define INITRAMFS(align)					\
	. = ALIGN(align);					\
	.init.ramfs : AT(ADDR(.init.ramfs) - LOAD_OFFSET) {	\
	__initramfs_start = .;					\
	*(.init.ramfs)						\
	__initramfs_end = .;					\
	}
or something similar.
  i'm guessing there's a fair amount of content like that that can be
coalesced, no?  it would also standardize some of the niggling
differences between some of that content between the two files.
