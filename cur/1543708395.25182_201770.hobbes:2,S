Alright then.
http://jlcooke.ca/lkml/crypto_24feb2004.patch
Changes:
 - Added CTR mode to cipher.c
 - Fixed Bug where CTR wasn't getting allocated an IV
 - Added config for OMAC option on encryption
 - Moved scatterwalk stuff to scatterwalk.c added to makefile
 - Removed kmalloc'd scratch space in hmac.c which caused a reported bug.
 - kernel config defaults to build all the IPSec required algorithms as
   well as OMAC (OMAC is only computed if specified by caller)
