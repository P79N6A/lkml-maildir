Not fundamental reasons, but these patches break the ia64 build for most
configs with:
In file included from kernel/futex.c:59:
include/asm/futex.h: In function `futex_atomic_op_inuser':
include/asm/futex.h:62: error: implicit declaration of function `pagefault_disable'
include/asm/futex.h:86: error: implicit declaration of function `pagefault_enable'
make[1]: *** [kernel/futex.o] Error 1
Adding an include of <linux/uaccess.h> to kernel/futex.c is sufficient (but
not necessarily right) to unbreak this.
A few configs also fail with:
mm/migrate.c: In function `migrate_page_copy':
mm/migrate.c:359: error: implicit declaration of function `copy_highpage'
make[1]: *** [mm/migrate.o] Error 1
Making mm/migrate.c include <linux/highmem.h> fixes this one.
