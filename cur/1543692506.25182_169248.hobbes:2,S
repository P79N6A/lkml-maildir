You are correct that recent cdrecord can use devices without ide-scsi,
but if you are running both 2.4 and 2.6 your really avoid a lot of
config changes to just use ide-scsi all the time. And for other ATAPI
devices ide-scsi is still easier than rewriting applications to use the
new interface. SCSI-only code works with fewer portability issues.
