Please remove it.
The kernel printk messages are sentences. English language sentences end
with a full stop. They are messages printed up for normal human beings to
read and they should therefore be properly written.
In fact you should warn if it ends with a newline without a full stop
unless the next line is continuation of quoted text because that suggests
a full stop has been missed out incorrectly.
