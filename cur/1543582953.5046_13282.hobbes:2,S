binfmt-464c is ELF -- it means your kernel came across an ELF
executable and was unable to execute it so it tried to load the ELF
binary format module.  Since you have ELF compiled into your kernel
already, this didn't work.
My guess is that you have a corrupt ELF executable on your system,
which your ELF loader refuses to load.  Every time someone tries to
execute it, your kernel will do a 'modprobe -k binfmt-464c'.
If you can't find the executable in question and just want to get the
message out of your logs, add
  alias binfmt-464c off
to your /etc/modules.conf .
