If reclaim can live lock then it needs to be fixed.

That is an extreme case that AFAIK we currently ignore and could be 
avoided with some effort. The initial PF_MEMALLOC patchset seems to be 
still enough to deal with your issues.

The rest of the system may have their own tights spots. Language the "the 
tight spot" sets up all sort of alarms over here since you seem to be 
thinking about a system doing a single task. The system may be handling 
multiple critical tasks on various devices that have various memory needs. 
So multiple critical spots can happen concurrently in multiple 
application contexts.

We have that with PF_MEMALLOC.

Its a performance impact and plainly does not make sense if there is 
reclaimable memory availble. The common action of the vm is to reclaim if 
there is a demand for memory. Now we suddenly abandon that approach?
