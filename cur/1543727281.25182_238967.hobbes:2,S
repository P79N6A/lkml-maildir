I've just finished implementing a 'suspend this subtree' patch, which
I'll happily post for comments/testing. I'll try to do that shortly.

I didn't implement it as devices saying 'can't suspend'. Instead, I
added a layer of abstraction. Imagine the current dpm_active, dpm_off
and dpm_off_irq lists as representing the states of a subtree of the
devices. We pop them into a struct partial_device_tree (device_subtree
better?) and provide facilities for creating and destroying new struct
partial_device_trees, moving a-device-and-its-parents between trees and
merging trees back. We also adjust the current suspend, resume, power-up
and power-down routines so they're tree-aware and set up a
'default_device_tree' that the devices sit in for normal operation.
That's what my patch does. I kept the existing api untouched so that:
device_resume();
is actually a wrapper for
device_resume_tree(&default_device_tree);
Proof of the pudding coming :>
