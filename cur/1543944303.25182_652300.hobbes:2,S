I was actually wrong when saying the "Front" channel did not influence HP-out 
in 2.6.24 - it did, so no regressions here.

No, setting Master and/or Front channel to 0% did not mute audio in any 
version I used.
I'm now listening to music with Master=0% and Front=0%, the sound is at well 
audible volume. Pastebin for this configuraion is here:

However I don't consider it a problem, it's mutable by PCM and HP/Speaker 
switches. Funny thing is that resulting volume of those 3 setting is equal:
* Master=0, Front=0
* Master=100%, Front=0
* Master=0, Front=100%
But when both set to let's say 50, changing one of these audibly affects 
resulting volume.

Would it be easy to do this in a robust way? If not, it's not worth it.
On a side note, I experience increased noise when not playing anything during 
2.6.24 -> .25-rc1 upgrade, but this is probably completly unrelated to 
today's problem.
Anyways, thanks for your effort and patches, Takashi.
