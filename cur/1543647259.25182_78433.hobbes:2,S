I agree with you, but only if we _always_ have one config file per driver. 
Which is not necessarily the wrong thing to do. 
But as long as most drivers are in "grouped" config files, they should be 
things like "Config.3com" etc.
Looking at existing big config files (video, networking), they do _not_ 
group according to driver, but according to other criteria (ie "PCI card", 
"100/1000 Mbit", "3com", "Sparc-specific" etc).
