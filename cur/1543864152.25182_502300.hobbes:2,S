I often run into the following annoying problem when working on the 
2.6.16 and trivial trees:
I want to change or delete the x-th commit from the top under the 
following prerequisites:
- the last x commits don't contain merges
- the last x commits aren't pushed anywhere else
The only tool I know that helps me doing this conveniently is stgit.
Testcase:
$ cg-push  #  everything is pushed in this testcase
$ vi Makefile
$ cg-commit 
Committed as 94b13e5b0f46ba38ee6fd8f47b418d8a18eded52
$ stg init
$ stg uncommit -n 1  #  uncommit x-1 commits
Uncommitting 1 patches... done
$ stg pop -a
Popping patch "asdf"... done
No patches applied
$ #  in real use cases, that's the point where I'm using 
$ #  cg-admin-uncommit (plus perhaps later cg-commit) on the x-th commit
$ stg push -a
Fast-forwarded patch "asdf"
Now at patch "asdf"
$ stg commit
Committing 1 patches... done
$ cg-admin-uncommit -t
Rewinding 94b13e5b0f46ba38ee6fd8f47b418d8a18eded52 (HEAD) -> 08ceda6f8c5d68108308cf01fc5c3ec35775baa9
$ cg-push  # should work (and report that the tree is unchanged in this testcase)

error: src refspec master matches more than one.
fatal: unexpected EOF
$ cat .git/refs/bases/master

$ rm -r .git/refs/bases  #  workaround found using Google
$ cg-push  # works fine

Everything up-to-date

Versions:
git 1.4.4.4
cogito 0.18.2
stgit 0.11
Any hints on whom to blame for this?
Or if these tools aren't expected to work together in this way, what is 
the official way for getting the same functionality?
TIA
Adrian
