In general, I think we should not be servicing interrupts once the system
has crashed and crash_kexec() has been invoked. 
In fact, right now machine_crash_shutdown() explicity disables interrupt
before sending NMIs to other cpus to stop these cpus and which makes sense to
me.
I am wondering if interrupts are disabled on crashing cpu or if crashing
cpu is inside die_nmi(), how would it stop/prevent delivery of NMI IPI to
other cpus.
Am I missing something obivious?
Thanks
