Subject: query_modules syscall gone? Any replacement?

Greetings,
  I'm coding an application that messes with modules a lot, and I've 
stumbled upon a query_modules syscall in my docs. Later I've found out 
that the docs come from modutils and that module-init-tools doesn't seem 
to document (any of) the syscalls.
  May I then ask, why is the query_module syscall gone? And more 
importantly, what replaces it, if anything? It seems to me that parsing 
the /proc/modules is not only less comfortable, but according to the 
very obsolete manpage I have, it also can provide less information.
  For exmaple I'm not aware of anything like QM_SYMBOLS on per-module 
basis like it was (do correct me if I am wrong, it'd simplify my work a 
lot), ... and getting QM_REFS for example requires extensive parsing of 
/proc/modules.
Thanks in advance for reply.
