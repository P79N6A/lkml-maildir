Concerning third, I allow for labels and comments (after #), so anybody
can add any type of recognizable comments or pragmas. The header line
and closing line are examples of comments that already have significance.
Concerning second, I think you misunderstood something. Don't know why
you think I am using MBR - certainly not to put this plaintext table.
In fact MBR has a traditional DOS-type partition table that allows for
a boot setup in traditional ways in case utilities are used that only
understand the old ways. But type 88 describes a (very short) partition
that contains the plaintext partition table. Life is easy:
	# emacs partition_table
	# cat partition_table > /dev/sda2
and reboot or
	# blockdev --rereadpt /dev/sda
Concerning one, it is a somewhat complicated format that takes over
your disk, rather inconvenient. It seems to me that one needs a good
reason (like a BIOS that understands the format and is able to boot
from it) to choose it.
