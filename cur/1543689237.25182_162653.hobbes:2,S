yes

I understand the purpose of NETIF_MSG_ALL; re-read what I said.  You 
don't need a separate _test_, as your implementation includes.  Defining 
NETIF_MSG_ALL to 0xffffffff will naturally create the effect you seek.

I would prefer to be more ambitious.  If we're gonna go in and change 
every printk in a driver, we might as well do it right, and (a) make 
sure the driver does msg_enable, and (b) make the source code a bit more 
clean by hiding the "if (test bitmap)" test in your netdev_xxx stuff.
