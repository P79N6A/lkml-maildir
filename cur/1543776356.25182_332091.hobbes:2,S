Jon,
    Most likely it might be doing it but returning inmediately. If you 
are in a quiet place, you should be able to notice the change.
    You can test this by having 2 consoles. With one you run the command 
and with the other one, try going deep into the filesystem, you should 
notice that it takes awhile to find the files and folders.
If it is fast, then is not parking.
