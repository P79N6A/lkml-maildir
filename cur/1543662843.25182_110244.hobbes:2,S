I do not see a large difference between the desired semantics of an
orderly shutdown, and the desired semantics of a panic shutdown.

device->shutdown() is new enough and unimplemented enough that adding a restriction
against blocking is a reasonable additional, restriction.  If that is a reasonable
thing to do.

The kernel started during panic has one purpose, to record the state of
the system for analysis.  So it need not support a fully functioning
user space.
By definition if a panic has happened something bad has happened, we assume
it is a software problem.

Because the kernel to handle the panic only initializes those devices
it can reliably initialize from any state.   And it is living in an
area of memory the old kernel did not allow DMA to.

The kexec on panic thing is not to replace a reboot.  It is to
reliably capture the system state when something nasty happens, which
you cannot do after a reboot.  
If the system can be made robust enough to use for other purposes
great, but that is not the goal.

Basically the panic logic does not change:
if (...) {
        machine_kexec();
}
else {
        machine_restart();
}
After an event like that you may need to restart the machine to be
100% reliable.  Or much more likely it was a hardware failure and
hardware needs to be replaced.  
But if it is a software failure kexec'ing a new kernel should provide
the capability so the software state at the failure can be captured so
the problem does not need to be reproduced for the developers.
Allowing the software to be corrected more quickly, and hopefully
correcting the problem before it would reoccur naturally.
