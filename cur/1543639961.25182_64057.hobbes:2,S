1.  Printing output corrupted using kernel 2.4.19.
2.  Print output from three Linux servers corrupted.  These servers are 
running Samba 2.2.5, and are Slackware 8.0 or 8.1 systems.  Print output 
from Windows platforms, especially .pdf files, gets corrupted.  Half 
pages are printed.  Pages are repeated, etc.  Drop back to the 2.4.18 
kernel, and the problem goes away.  Kernel on all systems compiled 
locally, e.g. on each system.  Print daemon is from the LPRng package. 
 Printers include TCP/IP printers (LPRng redirect using printcap) and 
those attached via parallel ports.  Windows systems include XP, 2000, 
and 98.  Regardless of the OS, the printer output is corrupted w/ 2.4.19 
kernel, but works fine when kernel 2.4.18 is run.
3.  Kernel, printing
4.  Kernel version - 2.4.19
5.  Output - no error messages reported
6.  Shell Script - not applicable.
7.  Environment:
If some fields are empty or look unusual you may have an old version.
Compare to the current minimal requirements in Documentation/Changes.
