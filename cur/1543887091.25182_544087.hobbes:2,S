Looks fine here... well, almost. Did you try rmmod (I don't even know if
it's applicable, sorry)? Usually, when schedule_work is involved, you want
to make sure that a scheduled work won't be run when the module is gone.
More often, a device removal is the issue, but as I take it, such is not
possible for a built-in device :-) . In most cases, all it takes is a
strategically placed flush_scheduled_work().
