-#define _LINUX_ELFNOTE_H
-/*
- * Helper macros to generate ELF Note structures, which are put into a
- * PT_NOTE segment of the final vmlinux image.  These are useful for
- * including name-value pairs of metadata into the kernel binary (or
- * modules?) for use by external programs.
- *
- * Each note has three parts: a name, a type and a desc.  The name is
- * intended to distinguish the note's originator, so it would be a
- * company, project, subsystem, etc; it must be in a suitable form for
- * use in a section name.  The type is an integer which is used to tag
- * the data, and is considered to be within the "name" namespace (so
- * "FooCo"'s type 42 is distinct from "BarProj"'s type 42).  The
- * "desc" field is the actual data.  There are no constraints on the
- * desc field's contents, though typically they're fairly small.
- *
- * All notes from a given NAME are put into a section named
- * .note.NAME.  When the kernel image is finally linked, all the notes
- * are packed into a single .notes section, which is mapped into the
- * PT_NOTE segment.  Because notes for a given name are grouped into
- * the same section, they'll all be adjacent the output file.
- *
- * This file defines macros for both C and assembler use.  Their
- * syntax is slightly different, but they're semantically similar.
- *
- * See the ELF specification for more detail about ELF notes.

-/*
- * Generate a structure with the same shape as Elf{32,64}_Nhdr (which
- * turn out to be the same size and shape), followed by the name and
- * desc data with appropriate padding.  The 'desctype' argument is the
- * assembler pseudo op defining the type of the data e.g. .asciz while
- * 'descdata' is the data itself e.g.  "hello, world".
- *
- * e.g. ELFNOTE(XYZCo, 42, .asciz, "forty-two")
- *      ELFNOTE(XYZCo, 12, .long, 0xdeadbeef)
