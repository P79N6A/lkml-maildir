Ah, I knew that the patch doesn't work with partial completion but I
thought that it doesn't happen with PC commands... And touching
__end_that_request_first looked really hacky so I didn't send such
patch.
Moving the padding adjustment to blk_rq_map_sg (James' proposal) looks
fine. Maybe Jens will come up with something better.
