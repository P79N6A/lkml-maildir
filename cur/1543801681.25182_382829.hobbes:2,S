If gcc would look at that code *after* it expands the call, it would
actually notice that everything's fine.  The codepath leaving the
inlined block without setting idx would look like
	bvl = NULL;
	goto l1;
...
l1:
	if (!bvl)
		goto l2;
	use idx
...
l2:
	mempool_free(bio, bs->bio_pool);
	bio = NULL;
	goto out;
and after that exit collapses into jump directly to l2, we end up with
situation when every path to use of idx obviously going through l1 and,
before that, end of switch() in inlined block.  All possible precursors
of that end of switch assign idx.
And yes, if you inline it manually gcc _will_ see that everything's OK.
Path that confuses it is
	default in switch -> exit from bio_alloc_bs() -> l1 -> use of idx
and 
		return value will be NULL	=>	  we will go to l2
is what it doesn't notice when it inlines itself.
