You didn't include your .config, but it seems you have
CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC=y.
Please try either 2.4.10 with CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC=n (don't worry,
you don't need it and won't lose any performance) or 2.4.9-ac with
CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC=n and CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC=y.
There seems to be something amiss with the merge of the UP local APIC
code from -ac (where it's brilliant, but I'm biased) in 2.4.10, but I
haven't had time to investigate. I'm almost certain that it was a mistake
to lump UP *local APIC* and UP *IO-APIC* together under the same config
option in 2.4.10 -- they're separate in 2.4-ac.
