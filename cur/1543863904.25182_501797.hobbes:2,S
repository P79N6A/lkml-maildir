What BIOS do the machines have? 04xx versions are known to be horribly 
buggy (even the-other-OS(tm) users experience strange things).
In case you have BIOS 04.., try to upgrade to 06.. version. Also, does it 
help when you boot with acpi=off kernel commandline parameter? (do you 
compile kernel with both acpi and apic support?).
