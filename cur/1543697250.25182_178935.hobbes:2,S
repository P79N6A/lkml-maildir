If you had to re-mkswap, that means suspend was indeed
successfull. Did you pass right resume= option? What did
kernel say when it refused to resume?

Hmm, I've seen something similar, but result was ok at the end.
It only took very long time.

You really should try without AGP. It has no support => it
will happily crash your machine at unrelated point during
resume.
