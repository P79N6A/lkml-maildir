This is not a problem here because ide_multwrite() walks rq->bio chain itself.
It also updates current_nr_sectors and hard_cur_sectors fields of drive->wrq.

RAID or device-mapper code doesn't seem to care about bio->bi_idx
value after bio has been submitted to the block layer, so the current
code is safe enough.  Also there is no place to store original bi_idx.

After finishing data transfer multwrite_intr() calls ide_end_request()
with rq->nr_sectors argument (where rq is hwgroup->rq not drive->wrq),
so only whole bios are completed.  There are no partial completions
and code depending on bio->bi_idx inside __end_that_request_first()
is not executed.
The real (generic) problem is that atomic block segment for a block device
(in this case ATA disk) can be composed of bvecs, bios or bios+bvecs and
driver can obtain information about next bvec from block layer (from rq->bio)
only after previous bvec has been acknowledgment by end_that_request_first().
In situation when information about previously processed bios/bvecs is needed
(ie. error condition) this information is already lost.
There are 2 solutions for this problem:
- Use separate bio lists (rq->cbio) and temporary data
  (rq->nr_cbio_segments and rq->nr_cbio_sectors) for submission/completion.
  Please look at process_that_request_first() and its usage in TASKFILE code.
  You are then required to do partial bio completion.
- Do not use struct request fields directly and store information needed by
  driver in separate data structures
  (ie. scatter-gather data stored by SCSI layer).
  You are then not allowed (and shouldn't need) to do partial bio completions.
IDE multi-sector code uses first method because second one was too
invasive/risky to be done (required serious rewrite of IDE transport code).
I hope generic block transport layer in 2.7.x will make life simpler.
