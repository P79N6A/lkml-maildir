We had a similar problem when our NFS server crashed hard - one of the
partitions reported this same error, and also something about "Are you
sure this isn't a zero-length partition?".  What worked for us was to
use the `-b' option to e2fsck, which forced e2fsck to look at a
different superblock.

I hope my help is greatly useful.
