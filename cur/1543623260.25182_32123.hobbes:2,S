Having reviewed the archives, it seems that the multipage PAGE_CACHE_SIZE
patches which Hugh and Ben were working on were mainly designed to increase
I/O efficiency.
If that's the only reason for large pages then yeah, I think we can stick
with 4k PAGE_CACHE_SIZE :).  There really are tremendous efficiencies
available in the current code.
Another (and very significant) reason for large pages is to decrease
TLB misses.   Said to be very important for large-working-set scientific
apps and such.  But that doesn't seem to have a lot to do with PAGE_CACHE_SIZE?

Sure I have.  I just created one.  (I'm writing test cases for my
emails now.  Sheesh).
