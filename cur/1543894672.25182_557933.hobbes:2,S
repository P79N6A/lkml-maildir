Nope. ROM alone is not the problem
The problem is that in this particular case, removing a ROM used to
vet software makes you liable under DMCA and friends
That's why something that could be tolerated in GPLv2 time before the
new IP world order can not be tolerated anymore. DRM is not deadly
because of the technical measures but the legal ones
GPLv3 is not there to change the technical equation but the legal
equation. Blame the change on IP law apprentice sorcerers, not the on
