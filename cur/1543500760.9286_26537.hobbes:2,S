	Eee...  Big blue MVS rearing its head ?
	Actually there are other uses for such things too, and likely
	more common ones.

	Yes, and ultimate storage medium is magnetic tape (for files).
	A careless egrep thru the filesystem causes massive randomish
	tape activity (at the robot), of course..
	Still, one can do a 'find' thru the entire filesystem, and stat()
	will yield sensible info.  ( + possible magic flag telling the
	file is actually offline ...)

	Me neither -- not now, anyway, but e.g. SGI XFS (as I understand
	it) can use that facility too.
