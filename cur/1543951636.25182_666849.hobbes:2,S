Rusty, please *look* at your patches.
It's pretty obvious even from just the patch that the patch has already 
been applied, and that the only reason you think it hasn't is that you use 
some crap-for-brains SCM model where you apply patches with GNU patch and 
allow fuzz, so it applied cleanly *again*.
I assume that it's quilt messing up again.
In particular, this already went in as commit 
7adfa2ff3efa02a7a9f2632d2d2662d3e5eb5304, and I know for a *fact* that it 
is in your tree too, since the patch itself clearly has that code double:
>  	    && iocb->ki_nbytes - iocb->ki_left)
>  		ret = iocb->ki_nbytes - iocb->ki_left;
Lookie above: those two lines are part of the thing that already got 
applied! If it hadn't been applied, it would look like
        if ((ret == 0) || (iocb->ki_left == 0))
                ret = iocb->ki_nbytes - iocb->ki_left;
instead.
I *hate* people who "merge" using patches, and then to make it even worse 
use a non-zero fuzz factor.
