If the patches are a formal submission then please send them to Jeff,
netdev and I'd like a cc too.
If they are not considered quite ready for submission then please just send
them to myself, thanks.  A netdev cc would be appropriate as well.  Basically
I just want to get that sn2 machine to boot.
Generally it's better to cc too many mailing lists and individuals than too
few.
