I don't know anything that will do this on a pre-built kernel.  But,
you should look at CONFIG_CMDLINE_BOOL and CONFIG_CMDLINE in your
kernel configuration.  That will let you pre-configure the "root="
command line option.
I don't know if ppc64 can use the zImage-style boot wrapper.  If it
can, that would provide you with an option of modifying the command
line at boot time if needed.
Good luck!
