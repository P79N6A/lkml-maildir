No, sad to say it still happens to us too.  Argh is right!
I'll cc this to dri-devel and lkml in case anyone wants to try hunting
the bug again.
FWIW, I'm still seeing the ioctl(5, 0x6444, 0) / SIGALARM behavior I
reported originally.  This has continued to happen regularly with all
2.6 kernels up to 2.6.17.6 and Xfree/X.org up to 6.9.
