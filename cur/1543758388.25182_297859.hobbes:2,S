Yes.  But this problem can be solved in userspace, with a little library
function and a bit of locking.
IOW: use the library to enable/disable the fork connector rather than
directly doing syscalls.
It has the problem that if a client of that library crashes, the counter
gets out of whack, but really, it's not all _that_ important, and to handle
this properly in-kernel each client would need an open fd against some
object so we can do the close-on-exit thing properly.  You'd need to create
a separate netlink socket for the purpose.
