We've incorporated the majority of Christoph's requests, along
with changes requested by a few other developers.  We'll post the
next set later tonight after testing a few SMP/UP/IDE/SCSI crashes
with all of the changes.
There are a couple of things that we didn't change due to the
nature of the project, which I'll first discuss with Christoph
off-line to avoid going down a big rathole. :)  Suffice it to
say that we incorporated almost everything he asked for.
We'll make this deadline.
