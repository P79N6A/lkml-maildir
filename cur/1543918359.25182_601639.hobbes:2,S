Good catch, adam.
From what I can see, the statement
        if (count >= nr_huge_pages)
                return nr_huge_pages;
in set_max_huge_pages() is useless because (1) we recalculate "count"
variable below it; and (2) both try_to_free_low() and the while loop
below the call to try_to_free_low() will terminate correctly.  If you
feel like it, please clean it up as well.
If not, I'm fine with that.
