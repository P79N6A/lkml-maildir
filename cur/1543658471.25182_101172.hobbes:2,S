Please note that Tony's new accel_putcs() code uses __u32 to pass the character
indices.  So it's not limited to 256/512 characters per font. Fonts can be as
large as you want. Sparse fonts can be handled as well, if accel_putcs() takes
care of the conversion from sparse character indices to dense character
indices.
His code can be viewed as a way to do multiple monochrome to color expansions
with one single call, using a predefined table of patterns. Quite generic,
unless you want to have multi-color fonts later :-)

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
