It's good to see some of these secret embedded patches heading in
the mainline direction.
But we'd expected and hoped that flash-based XIP would be able to use
the existing xip infrastructure, in mm/filemap_xip.c.  Not possible?
The de-constification of cramfs_ops and cramfs_dir_inode_operations
was, I assume, a mistake?
