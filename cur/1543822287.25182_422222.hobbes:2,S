You've done a nice job of making the code look like kernel code
throughout, it's a much tidier patchset than many.
With that said... it looks to me like one of the scariest and
most inappropriate sets I can remember.  Getting the kernel to
connive in presenting an incoherent view of its pagecache:
I don't think we'd ever want that.
There's all kinds of things that could be said about the details
(your locking is often insufficient, for example); but there's a
lot going on, and it doesn't seem worth going through this line
by line, when the whole concept seems so unwelcome.
You've a big task to convince people that this is something the
Linux kernel will want: and perhaps you'll succeed - good luck.
But please approach what you're trying to do from userspace:
you can patch the binaries from there if you wish (but not on
my system, thanks).  Or perhaps you can patch it all into the
kernel via kprobes itself, but I wouldn't recommend it.
