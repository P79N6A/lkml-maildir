I'm interested in this kind of thing too.  Though I am wondering if the IDE
layer has the same kind of issues.  I notice because the kernel initialization
time is 50% of my boot time.  I have the kernel loaded 3 seconds from
power on...
My impression is that the time during kernel initialization is either
spent spinning up disks or in a million device probes and things going
on behind the scenes.  I haven't had a chance to look farther though.
