But trivial to notice. :)

If aunt Tilly has a core dump, her son can extract it and send it to
some developer.  No need for you to drive over to aunt Tilly.

"It just what you asked for, but not what you wanted."
I am a firm non-believer in the trust-the-programmer paradigm.  How
many people actually intend to do NULL-pointer dereferences, etc?  To
make this possible "if you really really want to" is ok, but at least
make the bad behaviour hard to trigger by accident.
What Linux did in 2.5.7x is not exacly what I would have done, but it
makes it hard to do the Wrong Thing (tm) by accident, while allowing
it for those who really want it.  Good enough for most users.
