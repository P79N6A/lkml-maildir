In the past, this has generally been a very bad idea.  It's led to some
excessively ugly drivers (see aic7xxx for one) and generally doesn't work
terribly well.  If you insist on going down this road, could you at least
make sure it's written to the newest 2.6 APIs and every other supported
kernel version emulates the 2.6 APIs?  The awful "kernel neutral API"s
used in some drivers really suck.

himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep
