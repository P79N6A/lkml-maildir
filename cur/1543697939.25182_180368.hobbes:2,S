No, it wouldn't help. Something in the kernel randomly corrupts memory. 
I'm certain that it's not slab. I'm also fairly certain that it's not 
the hardware - IBM guys reproduced corruptions on both ppc64 and i386 
systems (bugzilla 1097 and 1497). The corrupted object is the slab 
structure or the bufctl entries - data near the beginning of a page. But 
I have no idea how to pinpoint it.
