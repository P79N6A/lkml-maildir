For metadata only reiserfs does its own write management.  The buffers
come from getblk. We just don't mark the buffers dirty for flushing by
flush_dirty_buffers()
This has the advantage of avoiding races against bdflush and friends, and
makes it easier to keep track of which buffers have actually made their
way to disk.  It has all of the obvious disadvantages with respect to
memory pressure.
