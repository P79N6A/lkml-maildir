? 
? These are compaq made up ioctls. They shouldnt be merged like that. Instead
? there needs to be proper discussion about what is actualyl needed
Would it help to move these into a cpqfc specific header file? I'm
making changes to cpqfc already anyway (to use new DMA interfaces) so
I oculd move those ioctls while I was at it.
