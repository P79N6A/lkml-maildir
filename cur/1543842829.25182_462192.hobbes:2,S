  OK. I've run IOZONE rewrite throughput test on my computer with
iozone -t 10 -i 0 -s 10M -e
  2.6.18-rc6 and the same kernel + my patch seem to give almost the same
results. The strange thing was that both in vanilla and patched kernel there
were several runs where a write througput (when iozone was creating the file)
was suddenly 10% of the usual value (18MB/s vs. 2MB/s). The rewrite numbers
were always fine. Maybe that has something to do with block allocation
code. Anyway, it is not a regression of my patch so unless your test
finds some problem I think the patch should be ready for inclusion into
-mm...
