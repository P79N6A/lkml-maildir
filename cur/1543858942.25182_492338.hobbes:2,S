    Duh, I hoped tha this driver may get into 2.6.20-rc1 and finally 
overlooked this. Sigh, uou won't believe how much time this driver rewrite 
spent in an unfinished state in my internal tree... :-/

    Well, I'd agree with Alan here. Don't expect me to convert this to libata

this certainly won't happen soon (if at all)...
