Well it's doing clear_highpage() before __alloc_pages() has called
kernel_map_pages(), so CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC is quite kaput.
So the current __GFP_ZERO buglist is:
1: Breaks CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
2: Breaks the cache aliasing protection for anonymous pages
3: prep_zero_page() uses KM_USER0 so __GFP_ZERO from IRQ context will
   cause rare memory corruption.
