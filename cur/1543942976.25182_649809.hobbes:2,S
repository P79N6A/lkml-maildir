Just to give you a background. I wrote and maintain 
http://libe1000.sf.net
So I know E1000 HW and SW in and out. And no I'm not confused with other HW and I know that we're 
not using SW timers for the coalescing. HW can be buggy as well. Note that I'm not saying that I
know for sure that the problem is coalescing, I'm just suggesting to take it out of the equation
while Pavel is investigating.
Unfortunately I cannot demonstrate an example but I've seen unexplained packet delays in the range 
of 1-20 milliseconds on E1000 HW (and boy ... I do have a lot of it in my labs). Once coalescing 
was disabled those problems have gone away.
