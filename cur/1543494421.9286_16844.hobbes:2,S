I got a report from an user of one of my programs that his /proc/cpuinfo
doesn't identify his processor properly on his 2.2.6 kernel. 
--report--
Got this for my IBM PS/1 with a intel 486SX-33 (may be 25)
Linux netpimp 2.2.6 #1 Mon Apr 19 21:46:05 EDT 1999
netpimp:/# cat /proc/cpuinfo 
processor       : 0
vendor_id       : unknown <-- LOOK!!
cpu family      : 4
model           : 0
model name      : unknown

fdiv_bug        : no
hlt_bug         : no
sep_bug         : no
f00f_bug        : no
fpu             : no
fpu_exception   : no
cpuid level     : -1
wp              : yes
flags           :

--end--
I think this isn't right, isn't it?!?! 
Cheers, 
Alex
