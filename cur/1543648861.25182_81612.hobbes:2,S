Yes, I also noticed many problems with the current orinoco_cs driver.
I've reported them to David, but had very little response thus far.
Basically, iwconfig ethx essid foo appears to crash the cards firmware
(I get really interesting series of words in the chips registers giving
a nice ASCII string.)
I did find that if I took the wvlan_cs driver from a Red Hat kernel and
drop it into 2.5, it works (as far as I can tell) quite nicely.
Unfortunately, I haven't been able to do any further investigation of
this; I'm not too bothered because wvlan_cs gets me working.
(My card is a Lucent WaveLAN Silver)
