The issue I found was that if you are running a process that is io bound, for
example, then you may never need to run your cpu at 100%, it will speed up
bit by bit[1] till it gets to a speed that is fast enough to to deal with it
without max'ing the cpufreq.
This is after all exactly want most (if not all) the userspace daemons try to 
do anyway.
Cheers

[1] also you might find that the task does not last long enough to warrant 
	jumping and lurking at 100% speed anyway
