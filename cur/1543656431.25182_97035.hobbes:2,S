Hello, Jaroslav and All.
How about other changes in new 2.5 kernel, like new PnP layer (Adam Belay)
or changes with module & boot params (Rusty Russel)? There are now some
changes in 2.5.52 kernel in sound/isa/opl3sa2.c that make this driver not
compatible with other kernels. May be it's better split your tree in
several trees for each version of kernels?
