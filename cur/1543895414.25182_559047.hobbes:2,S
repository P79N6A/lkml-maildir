Subject: ARC-1260: No space left on device, when there is (or should be) free space left

It seems I have a problem accessing the whole device, it filled up too quickly.
I thought I was avoiding the 2tb limit when not using any partition tables, shame on me :)
# df -B 1 /dev/sdb
Filesystem           1B-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/sdb             5999417057280 1908287229952 4091129827328  32% /storage/disk1
(Ok here I have 68% free space on our 5.5TB device)
# echo zzz > /storage/disk1/dummy
/storage/disk1/dummy: No space left on device
(But here it seems to think the device is full)
It's an amd64 based system running 2.6.21.5.
Please tell me if you need more information!
Regards,
Magnus
