Maybe, although as I said, I just don't know what exactly you would
predict and what the goals would be.
And often you'll be left with an ad-hoc pile of heuristics driving
(or being driven by) your ad-hoc analysis / prediction thingy. Analysing
the end result becomes very difficult. See drivers/block/as-iosched.c :P

You still have an ad-hoc starting point because it is not clear what
scheduling choices are the best.

That too
