Because of other sticky issues still unresolved and the lack of apparent
real need to support the troublesome case, at last check Linus was leaning
towards disallowing CLONE_THREAD&~CLONE_DETACHED in copy_process so that
the exit_signal = -1 change in zap_other_threads is no longer apropos and
can be taken back out entirely.  Unless that is done, the != group_leader
check most certainly has to go in.
Thanks,
Roland
