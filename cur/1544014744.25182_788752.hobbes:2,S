Ah, and you think that the failure of these cards in some embedded devices 
will push the vendors of these cards to fix their bugs?
Sorry, I don't think so. If this driver will run in more than 50% of all SD 
card devices: yes. But in reality, it will be below 1%...

IMHO, not supporting a non-conforming card (if you CAN) is ignorance. 
Ignorance to the user, which you leave alone with her problems.

I don't see value in this compromise. The person which is able to turn the 
configuration option will be != the user of the device and != the owner of 
the card.
