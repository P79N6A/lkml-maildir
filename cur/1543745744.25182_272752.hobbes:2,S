Subject: [patch 02/10]  ieee/sbp2: replace schedule_timeout() with 	msleep()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I would appreciate any comments from the janitor@sternweltens list. This is one (of
many) cases where I made a decision about replacing
set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
schedule_timeout(some_time);
with
msleep(jiffies_to_msecs(some_time));
msleep() is not exactly the same as the previous code, but I only did
this replacement where I thought long delays were *desired*. If this is
not the case here, then just disregard this patch.
Thanks,
Nish
Description: Use msleep() instead of schedule_timeout() to guarantee
desired timeout.
