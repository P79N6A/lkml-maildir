You can find some references in the unoffical Kernel-Mailing list Archive, 
and there was a Patch for the 1.2.x Kernel series to make it Multiboot 
compliant, but I don't know what has happend to this.

I know that the ramdisk memory is reused, but not the memory needed for the 
ramdisk , and the romfs/minix,ext2... whatever filesystem code.
Beside that, this it is a very nice feature for making an Installation Disk / 
Distributions.
AFAIK the newest RedHat distribution use grub as standard Linux Loader,
if the Linux Kernel is able to load modules before mounting root, you can 
make a Kernel without any block/bus driver compiled in.
All i want to know is if anybody is still working on this, before i start 
coding myselve (I hate doing things twice).
