The comment isn't entirely accurate.

Yes.

The problem with __va() and pfn_to_kaddr() is that it adds unnecessary
calculation which the compiler can not optimise away.
From the use of LOCAL_MAP_NR(), we know that it's returning an offset
into a particular node, and that there's a 1:1 relationship between
the virtual and physical addresses within nodes.  That means that
LOCAL_MAP_NR() can take either a virtual address, a physical address,
or even a byte offset into the node.
In turn, that means that we can pass it whatever address we happen to
have available at the time, or whichever is simpler to calculate.
In the cases you're looking at (pfn to map number) giving it pfn <<
PAGE_SHIFT is entirely sufficient, and is in fact optimal for
performance.
