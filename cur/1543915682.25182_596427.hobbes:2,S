Subject: [PATCH] sched: fix to use invalid sched_class

Hi Ingo,
I found an issue about the scheduler.
If you need a test case, please let me know.
Here is a patch.
When using rt_mutex, a NULL pointer dereference is occurred at
enqueue_task_rt. Here is a scenario;
1) there are two threads, the thread A is fair_sched_class and
   thread B is rt_sched_class.
2) Thread A is boosted up to rt_sched_class, because the thread A
   has a rt_mutex lock and the thread B is waiting the lock.
3) At this time, when thread A create a new thread C, the thread
   C has a rt_sched_class.
4) When doing wake_up_new_task() for the thread C, the priority
   of the thread C is out of the RT priority range, because the
   normal priority of thread A is not the RT priority. It makes
   data corruption by overflowing the rt_prio_array.
The new thread C should be fair_sched_class.
The new thread should be valid scheduler class before queuing.
This patch fixes to set the suitable scheduler class.
