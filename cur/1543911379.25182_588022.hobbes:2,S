Most likely you also had the problem with 2.6.22.2 (maybe you have not
tested this one, though). There were bug fixes for forcedeth introduced
in this version, one of them being buggy. The patch below fixes it. Can
you please give it a try ? If it does not fix the problem, please try
2.6.22.1 which does not include those changes. I'm interested because
I have those changes pending for 2.6.20.17 too.
