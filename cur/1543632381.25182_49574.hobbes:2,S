Hi,
I just tried booting 2.4.19-pre9-ac3 (SMP, 1.25 GB, devfs) with the
"nosmp single" flags to try and debug a Firewire problem, and I found
this oddity in /proc/interrupts:
           CPU0       
  0:      28797          XT-PIC  timer
  1:        629          XT-PIC  keyboard
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  8:          0          XT-PIC  rtc
  9:          0          XT-PIC  acpi
 14:      10299          XT-PIC  ide0
 15:         26          XT-PIC  ide1
 16:          0            none  usb-ohci
 17:          0            none  ehci-hcd
 18:          0            none  ohci1394
 19:          0            none  usb-ohci, usb-uhci
NMI:          0 
LOC:          0 
ERR:          0
MIS:          0
Last time I booted an SMP kernel with "nosmp", there were no IRQs > 15
and all the PCI devices were remapped to 5,7,9,10,11 etc.
This doesn't look good...
