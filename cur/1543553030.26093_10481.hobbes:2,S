Mmmm.  Okay.  Maybe I fixed the 'wrong' place, but the place I 'fixed'
was in do_slow_gettimeoffset, which is inside #ifndef CONFIG_X86_TSC.
I'll compile with a printk in there at home tonight though.
*peers more closely*  Ho-ho.  I see.  There's one further down in the
timer interrupt itself.  Oops.  My bad.
Cheers,
Mark
