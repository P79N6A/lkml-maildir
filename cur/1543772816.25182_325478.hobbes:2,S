In practice, JFS will typically do b.  In some cases, an operation may
simply return -EIO (or not even that if the write is asynchronous), but
eventually, a failure to read or write metadata will lead to the file
system being mounted read-only.  Like ext2/3, this behavior is
configurable with the errors= mount option.
It's possible that JFS may behave like c for a short time, or if an I/O
error is isolated.

I'm not sure I understand the difference between 2) & 3).
If 1)b. applies, then 3)b. makes sense.  The initial error causes the
file system to be mounted read-only.  The original error is history, so
any additional errors must make sense in the current context.  Trying to
write to a read-only filesystem should return -EROFS.  Any new I/O
errors may return -EIO.  I'm not sure about -ENOENT, but it probably
makes sense from the context of the code returning the error.

I don't agree.  I think 1)b is the most useful for most purposes.  Most
users would like to be able to recover as much data as possible if a
disk starts failing.  Allowing the volume to remain mounted read-only
allows this without risking further damage to the file system.
