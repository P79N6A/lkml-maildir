Subject: [PATCH 2.6.14-rc4] kbuild: once again use Makefiles in obj tree
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

This is a re-send of a patch that I mistakenly only sent to Sam. This reflects a simplfication
of an earlier patch to restore the use of Makefiles from the objects tree, which is something
that stopped working somewhere in 2.6.14. The previous patch had extended the behavior for Kbuild
files, whereas this patch does not do that.

I tested the (slightly) simplified patch today and it seems fine. So, this checks for Kbuild
files in one place, and Makefile in two, thereby not extending the behavior that Makefiles
had prior to 2.6.14-rc* to Kbuild files.
Below is the patch I tried today. Please consider it.
This patch restores behavior that the build system had up through 2.6.13.
That is, that Makefiles present in the objects tree are used in favor of
those in the source tree when an objects tree is in use.
This patch does not extend that behavior for Kbuild files.
