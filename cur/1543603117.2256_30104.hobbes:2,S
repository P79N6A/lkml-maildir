It is ironic that the most popular thread about netconsole is a foolish
semantic argument, instead of a steady stream of patches for the various
network cards.

I agree.  I was actually thinking just now that I would "enhance" the
netconsole-server script so that:
1) it can start both the client and the server (I will just call it
   "netconsole", and use a config file to get the settings).  Maybe
   options like "--send" and "--receive" are unambiguous enough?
2) we don't need to specify the IP address of the local host for the
   "client" (possibly enhancing the client to listen on all configured
   interfaces by default.
Cheers, Andreas
