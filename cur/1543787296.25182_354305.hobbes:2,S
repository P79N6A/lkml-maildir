Hi Parag,
Here's what I get:
In 2.6.12.6:
/dev/hda:
 Timing cached reads:   1140 MB in  2.00 seconds = 569.80 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  102 MB in  3.02 seconds =  33.80 MB/sec
In 2.6.13.2:
/dev/hda:
 Timing cached reads:    28 MB in  2.15 seconds =  13.03 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:   14 MB in  3.30 seconds =   4.24 MB/sec
and after hdparm -m 16 /dev/hda (recall this is the default in 2.6.12.6)
/dev/hda:
 Timing cached reads:    24 MB in  2.05 seconds =  11.73 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:   36 MB in  3.11 seconds =  11.56 MB/sec
I ran thing a few times in each case and the results were close.  There
was nothing in dmesg.
