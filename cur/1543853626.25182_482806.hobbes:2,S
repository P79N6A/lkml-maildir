Subject: Promise SATA vendor drivers uploaded

To further assist anyone wishing to hack on sata_promise.c, I just 
uploaded the long-since-GPL'd vendor drivers for Generation-I and 
Generation-II chipsets to 
http://gkernel.sourceforge.net/specs/promise/
This should help with isolating the proper initialization sequence for a 
given set of chips, particularly.
If someone knows of updated versions of these GPL'd drivers, please let 
me know.
