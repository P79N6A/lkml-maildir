I don't know what's wrong with "unparsable", but there are quite a few
other spelling glitches in net/*.  The last line of 
diffstat -p1 patch-net:
66 files changed, 113 insertions(+), 113 deletions(-)
I'll send the actual patch (48KB) to Dave M. and Jeff G. in case someone
wants to apply this.
Sorry for the cut and paste pseudo-reply; my POP mailserver has been
down since Friday.  You can reply to me temporarily at:
