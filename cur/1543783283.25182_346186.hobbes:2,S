Dumb question: why?
Maybe I was asleep, but I don't recall seeing much discussion or exposition
of
- Why the kernel needs two clustered fileystems
- Why GFS is better than OCFS2, or has functionality which OCFS2 cannot
  possibly gain (or vice versa)
- Relative merits of the two offerings
etc.
Maybe this has all been thrashed out and agreed to.  If so, please remind me.
