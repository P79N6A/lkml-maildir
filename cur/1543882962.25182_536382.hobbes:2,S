if this was also on a wiki page...
1) contributors (also casual ones) may update it or add new entries
2) adding a "Forwarded-To:" field and a "renew" button, regression
   reports could be fired semi-automatically to the right recipients.
   also the casual reader might bug proper maintainer simply clicking
   on the button. grave regressions would get more clicks...
3) when the new release is cut, such page is converted and saved as known
   regression list
4) a mail filter on lkml could perform some bookkeeping so people hating
   web could simply drop a message and the wiki page could update itself
   (no, not abuse itself)
5) web lovers could simply click on the links to lkml to dig into
   the regression
it looks like a simple and rudimentary bug tracker, but it is only a
regression reminder with links in the lkml flow. a distilled human-driven
regression-oriented semi-automatic lkml archive.
yes, some smart hybrid wiki/php|python thing with a db which could be
used to automatically send regression reminders..
i'm not a web developer, i'm not able to suggest the right wiki-tool. i
could offer some space on a tiny server with bandwidth but without any
email capability.
