Hi,
Looking at the tlb_flush code path and its co-relation with
ARCH_FREE_PTE_NR, on x86-64 architecture. I think we still don't use
the ARCH_FREE_PTE_NR of 5350 as the caching value for the mmu_gathers
structure, instead fallback to using 506 due to some typo errors in
the code.
Found this link in the archives.

I don't think anything has been done on this yet (looked at 2.6.23).
Do let me know if its only a typo that needs a fix, or we are still
waiting for some other other changes to come into effect.
Thanks,
Alok.
