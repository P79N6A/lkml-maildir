I must say I never liked that maxcpus=0 ... does disable the APIC
too. There can be situations where you want only a single CPU,
but still full APICs because modern systems don't boot without. 
It's the old traditional documented semantics though,
but on the other hand if it never worked with ACPI i guess people are
not relying on it.
So perhaps it would be better to change that? 
Or add a new option to limit CPUs without disabling ACPIC?
