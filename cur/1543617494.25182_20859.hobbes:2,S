Stupid me, somehow KERN_DEBUG was not shown.
I traced it down from
read_cache_page -> lock_page -> __lock_page -> schedule
There it hangs and I was not able with my stupid methods or printk-ing
to find the place where it hangs in sched.c (Maybe because of recursive
calls to sched by printk).
One more thing: Taking off hdf from the ide controller and everything
works.
Another: same with 2.4.18-pre4
Best wishes
Norbert
