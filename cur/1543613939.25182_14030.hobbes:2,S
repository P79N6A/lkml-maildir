Release 1.9.11: Wed Dec 19 23:57:21 EST 2001
	* Added a ruleset-debugging mode to cmlconfigure.py.
	* Add 'like' keyword so help entries can be re-used by reference.
	* Fix some scoping problems in kxref.py that confused pre-2.2 Pythons.
I haven't solved Richard Todd's bugs in the logic engine yet =-- fortunately
they don't show up in ordinary use.  I expect to nail these shortly.
