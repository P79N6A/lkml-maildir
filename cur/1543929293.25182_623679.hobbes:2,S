Yes that would certainly be the obvious fix.  In other words, just use
smp_processor_id instead of the raw version.  I suppose the only issue
would be that disabling/enabling preemption isn't exactly cost-free and
we're going to be doing that for every single increment.
Hmm, wasn't someone else talking about a non-atomic version of atomic
ops lately (i.e., atomic with respect to the local CPU only)? Perhaps
this is the killer app for it :)
Thanks,
