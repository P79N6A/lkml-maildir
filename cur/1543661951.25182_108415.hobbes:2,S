I mean you kill throughput by submitting non linear requests. OK
with such small requests you probably would lose some throughtput
due to much greater ratio of overheads to work done, but in general
we are talking about disk head positioning. 10 1MB requests should
be much quicker than 1000 10K requests, for disk performance.
