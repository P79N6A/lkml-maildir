arch/um/kernel/irq.c is almost identical to the generic irq code
(ediff shows this nicely if that helps), the difference being
free_irq_by_irq_and_dev in free_irq --- which is why this was (nor
now) pushed into the UML drivers
i suspect the generated code before and after is almost identical
ideally this model needs a rework, but i don't see anyone having the
cycles to do this now so accommodating the generic-code is a sensible
solution for the interim

it was later ACKed, you were cc'd on that email --- it's been merged
yes, that means we have merged code with slightly different semantics
than before --- but it also means it doesn't crash
you mentioned there is another solution to this --- i'd love to see
that before i rewrite this again to address Jeff's concern about the
requirement for /proc to be mounted (which is legitimate)

this almost never happens these days, especially for i386 and amd64
i dont think i can recall it happenning in a big way for over a year
now

UML also has to cope with ptrace changes and any semantics related to
this.  there has been some flux in this area recently and it's not
over yet sadly
UML is the most complicated ptrace-using code i think ive ever seen :)
and some of the code probably relies on semantics which are not well
defined so keeping up with those changes is important
part of that might be noticing when it breaks and screaming at roland,
i dont know

was it submitted?  i really don't this the merge barrier is that high
from a maintainer for things like linux/arch/<foo> in most cases
the same is true for various drivers (it must be, so many of them are
horribly broken in places)

UML has been described as 'abandonware' amongst other things, this
isn't completely unjustified.  Any efforts I think to help keep it
more inline with the rest of the kernel to change this perception I
think are great --- if we can get enough cleanups in, we might even be
able to get more of the mainline people buildling and checking against
UML so we get let breakage in the future.
I think to do this we should first fix some of the bogons we have
before adding new code and features.

if we can get things more inline (fixes, track mainline, dont add new
features just yet) i think we can get more people to help out
right now it's too hard (too much effort) to most people to deal with
anyhow, i think enough has been said as we are mostly in voilent
agreement, if we can keep poking away at this i think we have a pretty
good shot and making UML less of a second-class citizen
