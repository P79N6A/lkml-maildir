Woah! Stop right there. Since when a work without a license spelled
out becomes "any GPL"?

Yes, you can. In this case you get _different_ software, maybe even
under different license. I bet if you go straight to the authors you
can get XFS or JFS under a commercial license, not GPL at all.

Let me quote GPLv2 for you:
"If the Program specifies a version number of this License which
applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of
following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation."
As you can see for "ant later version" to apply the program must
explicitely say "This program is distributed under GPLv2 and any later
version". Supplying text of GPL v2 with the program does not
automatically add that clause. IOW, if copying file would litrally
read "Distributed under GPL v2. For the text of GPL v2 go to
www.fsf.org" woudl you still argue that it is "GPLv2 and later"?
