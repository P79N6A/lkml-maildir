Hi!
Thanks to Rafael's great work, we now have working encrypted suspend
and resume. You'll need recent -mm kernel, and code from
suspend.sf.net. Due to its use of RSA, you'll only need to enter
password during resume.
[Code got some minimal review; if you are a crypto expert, and think
you can poke a hole within it, please try to do so.]
