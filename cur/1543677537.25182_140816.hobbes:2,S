Hi,
[Apologies in advance for posting here - I did google around and couldn't
find a more appropriate forum, but please redirect me if this is not OK. 
Also, I'm not subscribed, so would appreciate CC, but will of course check
the archives (didn't want to get swamped by mail just to be told to post
elsewhere).]
Using 2.4.20 (Debian system, but source from kernel.org) plus ext3 patches
from 
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/ext3/
 I am trying to get a Maxtor
DiamondMax Plus9 80Gb functioning.  AK77 Pro MB with VIA VT8233 SB (drive
is ATA133, chipset might do ATA100).  Other disks are SCSI-3 and work
fine.  Under load (copying /home from SCSI drive) the IDE drive gives
errors like:
Jun 15 22:31:08 tonto kernel: hdc: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
Jun 15 22:31:08 tonto kernel: hdc: drive not ready for command
Jun 15 22:31:08 tonto kernel: ide1: reset: success
Jun 15 22:31:09 tonto kernel: hdc: write_intr error1: nr_sectors=10,
stat=0x59
Jun 15 22:31:09 tonto kernel: hdc: write_intr: status=0x59 { DriveReady
SeekComplete DataRequest Error }
Jun 15 22:31:09 tonto kernel: hdc: write_intr: error=0x01 {
AddrMarkNotFound },
LBAsect=123295591, sector=123295270
(repeated ad infinitum with different values)
tonto:/var/log# hdparm /dev/hdc1
/dev/hdc1:
 multcount    =  0 (off)
 IO_support   =  0 (default 16-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  0 (off)
 using_dma    =  0 (off)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 158816/16/63, sectors = 160086465, start = 63
The geometry values are correct, according to Maxtor's docs.  (IDE0 is
occupied by CD+CDRW, hende hdc).
Is this a kernel problem?  If not, where should I go for help?
Feel free to ask for more data, tests, recompilation of kernel with
different params, etc - happy to help.  Will include kernel .config as a
bzipped attachment.
Thanks,
Andrew
