In the case of an inline function, you're saving a jump, because the
code that you would "goto" is right there in sequence with the code you
are executing as far as the processor is concerned.  In essence, you're
duplicating code, but you're not retyping code, and your keeping code
consistent accross all uses of it (keeping it modular).
It's trivial, but where you're trying to cut down on the total number of
instructions executed in kernel mode, you would think even where you
could save one instructon (and branches are expensive, no?) you would
want to.
