Well, in all fairness the kswapd changes _do_ make kswapd more eager to
keep running too (ie kswapd tends to keep running until there is no
shortage any more - which it traditionally hasn't really done).
There might be an argment for making kswapd less eager, and more of a
background thing.
Regardless of where it actually spends the CPU time.
