Hmm.. That would easily explain the differences, since NPTL will trigger 
both on 2.6.0 and the RH-2.4 kernel, but not on the standard 2.4.22 
kernel.
But there really should be zero contention on the stdio data structures, 
so the locking would have to be _seriously_ broken to make that kind o 
fdifference (not necessarily buggy, but seriously badly implemented). 
A non-contended lock should be at most one locked instruction if well 
done, both on LinuxThreads and NPTL.

That would be interesting.
