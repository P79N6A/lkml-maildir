Well, for LiS, a process does not sleep on read_lock whenever write_lock
might be called.  This is because only invalid getpmsg/putpmsg calls
(wrong file descriptor) can be made during module loading and unloading.
No valid file descriptors exist for getpmsg/putpmsg when the module is
unloading (proper use of MOD_INC/DEC_USE_COUNT).  I don't see that it
matters that a process sleeps holding a read_lock() when it is a given
that the write_lock() will never be attempted while the holder of the
read_lock() is sleeping.
