   is there any reason that the 2.3.4x kernels in particular make this
   an issue?  As recent as 2.3.34 with the same config this didn't
   happen.
Our UDP response behavior previously was extremely bad for
these sorts of transactions under any load.  It was nice
for all the simple cases, but as the connection attempt rates
increase the possibility of later applications seeing responses
meant for previous ones grows larger.
The new behavior fixes this hole.
Later,
