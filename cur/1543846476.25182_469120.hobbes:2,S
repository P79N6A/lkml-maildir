Having "noexec" (in its older form) on *every* user-writable
mount makes it harder for an attacker to run his own loaders,
so implementing it in other forms was useless in the past.

This is solvable the same way too - "chmod 'o-x' perl"
and run the scripts via binfmt-misc (not sure if this is
really suitable though). You need a trivial kernel patch
to make that possible.

With having "noexec" (in its older form) on every user-writable
partition - how they can do it?

Some explanation could do better, but oh well.

But I used them. And having them on _every_ user-writable
mounts at least used to give some results.

As was pointed out by Hugh, such a patch is unlikely.

Control of what? The malicious loader will always work - it is
unaffected by both mmap and mprotect changes. So what you can
control is only how many apps you break.

Yes, selinux is the only solution here.

Any real-life examples of what problem does this solve?
(except of the already discussed partially-solved ld.so problem)
