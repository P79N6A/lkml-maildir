Overhead+randomness would make an md stripe slower.
	This measurement is an indication of  how fast  the
	drive  can sustain sequential data reads
No Linux [R]AID improves sequential performance.  How would
reading 65KB from two disks in alternation be faster than
reading continuously from one disk?
There used to be some HW raid controllers that might have
improved sequential performance by using stripe sizes of 512
bytes (every access hit all disks) but then you suffered
near worst case latency with every non-cached read.
