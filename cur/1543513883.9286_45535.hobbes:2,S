After a long hiatus, I've just popped in 2.3.23 and booted up. Firstly,
there seems to be a problem with the matroxfb driver. 
This line
"video=matrox:xres:1280,yres:1024,depth:32,left:200,right:48,hslen:184,upper:26,lower:0,vslen:3"
worked perfectly well for 2.2.x kernels, but using with 2.2.23 resulted in
a blank screen even though I could see the hard disk light flicker on/off
and then stop evidently waiting for me to log in.
Trying "video=matrox:xres:1280,yres:1024" and
"video=matrox:xres=1024,yres:768" both resulted in some sort of screen but
it was all distorted and flickery, as if someone had set the vsync and
hsync all wrong, with large blocky text looking very distorted.
I look at the docs provided with the 2.3.23 kernel and I notice the
matroxfb docs looks the same as the 2.2.x kernels. I try using
"video=matrox:vesa:443" and I get a good screen but the interlacing is
very flickery. 
Jsut my 0.04 euros. 
Cheers, 
Alex
