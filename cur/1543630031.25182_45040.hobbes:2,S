Subject: 2.5.15 laziness in export-objs

2.5.15 has four Makefiles where all objects are marked as exporting
symbols.  This is lazy coding and causes spurious rebuilds.  Please
specify only those objects that really export symbols.
Also the export list is independent of whether an object is selected or
not.  That is, export-objs is unconditional.
fs/nls/Makefile:export-objs = $(obj-y)
arch/i386/pci/Makefile:export-objs     +=      $(obj-y)
drivers/base/Makefile:export-objs     := $(obj-y)
drivers/pci/Makefile:export-objs := $(obj-y)
cd directory
echo $(fgrep -l EXPORT_SYMBOL *.c | tr '\n' ' ' | sed -e '{s/^/export-objs := /; s/\.c/.o/g; }')
will get the correct list.  arch/i386/pci/Makefile exports nothing at all.
