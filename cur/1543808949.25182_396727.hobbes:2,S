Eric is right, on many architectures, incl. PPC64 I am sure, you can easily
configure a counter to measure at any priv levels including at the kernel level.
As such a 32-bt monitoring tool could see 64-bit generated samples. Similarly,
I don't think it would be unreasonable to have a 32-bit tool monitor 64-bit
applications.
The question is whether hardcoding the IP to always be u64 is a valid choice.
Eric's comment about overhead is based on the current default sampling format
which systematically adds a fixed size header to each sample. That header
contains the IP. So adding 4 bytes to this header is not a big deal.
However, because we can define virtual PMDs that map to software resources, it
is likely that the default format will evolve to allow an application to specify
everything it needs for each sample. For instance, you can have a PMD
that maps to the current PID, another one that maps to the interrupt IP. Then
you can chose to include those into the sample and you would nto need a fixed size
header anymore.
