.. for x=1. Their 2.3.x modules break quite spectacularly with x>2 or so,
at least for SMP machines, since the whole locking stuff for mm and net has

Believe me, I've tried, done the fsck's, and now am reverting to 2.3.9ac4
until the kernel stabilizes enough so that it makes sense for them to
update their drivers again.
