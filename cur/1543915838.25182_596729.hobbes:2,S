Willy,
The machine is a virtual machine on an VMware ESX 3.0.1 host.
/proc/cpuinfo shows two of these:
Dual
model           : 15
model name      : Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU           E5345  @ 2.33GHz
stepping        : 8
cpu MHz         : 2333.014
cache size      : 64 KB
It has 864MB of memory.
.config is at:
http://v.iki.fi/~vherva/tmp/2.4.35-config
The kernel is plain vanilla 2.4.35 from kernel.org, no patches.
gcc 2.96-129:
cat /proc/version 
Linux version 2.4.35 (root) (gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.2 2.96-129.7.2)) #1 SMP Thu Aug 9 10:35:37 EEST 2007
Memory is ECC.
The server is HP Proliant ML370 with 82801BA/CA/DB/EB chipset. I've had my
share of chipset bugs with older Via chipsets, but I think it's very likely
in this case.
This could very well be a VMware bug, but I wanted to know if this rings
bells for someone.
