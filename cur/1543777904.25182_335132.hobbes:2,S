Hi David ,
    On my controller CF INPACK pin is connected to 3.3v.  so Comapct flash
with DMA capabilty will not be supported , i understood this .
but i did not undesrtand why only PIO mode 1 is supported is it , why not
PIO mode 4 , is it a limitation of pcmcia driver , correct me if i am wrong
Thanks In Advance

All Compact Flash cards, in 16-bit PCMCIA card readers, operate in PIO
mode 1 (polled IO, no DMA), which means you will get only about 1
MB/sec regardless of the card's claimed tranfer speed.  Some cameras
also only support this mode; others will run CF cars in "TrueIDE"
mode, which is required to use the DMA transfer modes.
There are high performance CF card readers that can use TrueIDE mode:
both CardBus ones and Firewire ones.  For example:

It sounds like your card reader is one of the slow 16-bit ones.
