FWIW, we're batting around the idea of automating this -- it would be
cool (and quite trivial) to have a "bk-findbug.sh" script that takes
 - a repo
 - "I know the bug wasn't present in 1.1562"
 - "the bug is present in 1.1699"
 - a shell fragment that exits 1 if the bug exists, 0 if the bug is squashed
and tells you which cset causes the bug to appear.
But, applying this to the kernel is more problematic; you have to
reboot, or run under vmware/UML/Xen/whatever.
