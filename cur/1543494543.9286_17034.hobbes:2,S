Just bought myself a Jaton SoundWave 4D that is based on the Trident chipset
for $15 (figured I'd support someone who supports the project.. and it's
cheap). Just installed it last night on my RedHat 6.0 SMP box... popped it
in, made sure my ALSA drivers were up-to-date from CVS, setup conf.modules,
and bam, five minutes... working great. I've been pretty happy with ALSA and
since it is completely non-intrusive into the standard kernel it makes it
cake to use.
I have heard there can be problems running certain versions of Quake though.
