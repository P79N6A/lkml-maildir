My bad, I didn't investigate it very far before I responded.  It seems
that in proc_pid_cmdline(), it only returns the number of characters
that were in the _original_ command line (including nulls between
args).  Also keep in mind that the shell eats unquoted spaces.  This may
have been a result of when /proc was revamped a while back.
