Two notes:
  1. Udev doesn't restrict you to any one naming scheme.  If you want
something else than a MAC based scheme, e.g. a PCI topology based
scheme, udev most certainly can do that for you.  But the kernel can't.
  2. Consider udev a kernel extension in userspace, with the benefit of
configurability and scriptability, features that kernel extensions in
kernelspace can't offer.  Of course this gain of features doesn't come
at zero cost:  You need a minimal userspace environment at boot time.
Quoting myself from 
http://marc.info/?l=linux-scsi&m=118613786003162
:
There is a variety of possible naming schemes:
  - Naming by order of discovery.
  - Naming by vendor/model name strings.
  - Naming by universally unique identifier.
  - Naming by topology.
  - ...
Only the simplest of these schemes (naming by order of discovery) is
hardwired into the kernel portion of the Linux OS.  The other naming
schemes are (or can be) implemented in the userland portion of the Linux OS.
There is only the most primitive naming scheme implemented in the kernel
because naming policy, like most other kinds of policy, is better left
to userland.  The kernel is a too restricted framework to implement such
things.  The kernel lacks runtime-configuration files, scripting
interfaces, et cetera.
