Right, while this might appear to be sound, I hate to point out that we
only want to exclude it when current holds the rq->lock. This could lead
to spuriously missing klogd wakeups because other cpus hold our
rq->lock.
Now, is this klogd thing only relevant for dumping stuff into the log,
or also for writing stuff out to the serial line?
