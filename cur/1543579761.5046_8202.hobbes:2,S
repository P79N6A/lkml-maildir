Hi Duncan and Randy,
I tested Duncan's patch. It works for me with parameters "mpint=5,0,4,9".

dump_pirq gives me the same output like to Randy. I used the small 
program posted by Duncan to find the new USB interrupt.
If I understand it well, it's time to wait for BIOS upgrade and 
meanwhile Duncan's patch must be used, isn't it?
Thank you very much for all your help.
Petr
P.S. I'm sorry for the delay. I couldn't reboot the system because
it was in use by other users of our group.
