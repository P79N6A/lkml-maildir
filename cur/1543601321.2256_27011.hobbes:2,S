Heather -
EMC is in the device_list[] (in scsi_scan.c) as a sparse LUN device.
I don't quite follow your information about aic7xx and SCSI storage.
Doug Ledford posted a patch for this plus one other fix in:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=98462326721779&w=2
If you look at the current setting of *max_dev_lun, it either jumps
around (for low values of max_scsi_luns, i.e. 1), or is incremented
by 1/2 of shpnt->max_lun until it reaches max_scsi_luns (for high
values of max_scsi_luns, i.e.  0xffffffff). It is currently modified 
(for sparse LUN or force LUN devices) only when you find a LUN, but
its value is set each time not just once.
Always setting it to shpnt->max_lun is not very bad - if max_lun is
high, you are on fibre/FCP, and scanning should be very fast
compared to SCSI.
Here's a patch if you want to try it out, it also sets *max_dev_lun
for the early sparse lun check (we don't need the duplicate setting
for the second sparse lun check, but it does return 1 there, so I
left the settings of *max_dev_lun and *sparse_lun).
I've compiled but haven't run with this patch, though I've previously
compiled and run when patched against an earlier version of the
kernel (2.4.5 or so).
