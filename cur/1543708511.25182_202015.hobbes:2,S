Try to get /proc/meminfo and a sysrq + T trace if something like
this happens.

It is a bit easier said than done as you might have seen :P And
I'm laz^W^W I happen to not agree with one of Andrew's patches,
so it would go against all my principles ;)
IMO, shrink_slab-for-all-zones.patch and zone-balancing-fix.patch
should be all you need although they won't shrink the slab as
much as mm3. They should be pretty easy to port by hand.
