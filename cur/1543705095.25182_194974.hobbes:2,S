I'm having similar problems with kmail on the later kernels. Sometimes 
it works just fine, and in the middle of typing a nessage it can get 
laggy as hell, cursor motions with the arrow keys are down to 1 space 
a second, and gkrellm is saying the user apps are at 100% cpu.  
Screen redraws for a page up or page down might take 3 or 4 seconds.
Or it can get over it. (sometimes)
