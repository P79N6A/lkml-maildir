We only partially know the data type (btw you should ignore the const's).

There shouldn't be any consts in there, or else the pointers have to be cast
prior to freeing.
So I'd have to do three kmalloc's instead of just the one (assuming struct
fsblob was folded back into struct vfs_token)...

Yours may use more memory overhead, though that's not easy to judge. Also yours
is more complex in that there's more bits of memory to keep track of. OTOH,
your suggestion may permit sharing of fsname and maybe also key under some
circumstances.

OTOH, resources are very precious, and the complexity is actually
straightforward and can be wrapped with macros or inline funcs.
