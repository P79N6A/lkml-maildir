Yes.
As I found it in -pre3 the result was: timeouts and some debugs (Lionel has the
log) and no partition table was found (BadCRC messages from hda). It worked
then after a day or two when -ac1 or -ac2 was found so I think it was solved.
I will check -pre4 if it work.
Btw. I have a question... will an SiS 6326 AGP will be supported anyhow by agp
gart ? It is supported by Xfree driver but no xv nor AGP or dri acceleration
as I can see is realy used. It also has some wired problems with colorded dots
(blue and red).
But this is maybe a subject to AGP/SiS VGA/XFREE drivers maintaners :)
