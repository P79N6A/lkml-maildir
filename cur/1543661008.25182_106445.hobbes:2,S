Unless there are balancing issues adding a new zone is very trivial.
However any code in that direction will be an additional patch so
because ZONE_NORMAL works for most cases.  Alan Cox can have his high
memory case if he wants it.

Nope, kswapd will not free the kernels text segment.  So in practice
I can use anything below 4GB.

There is even a distribution built to be run completely out of a ramdisk.

As it currently exists kexec happens in two stages sys_kexec_load that
scatters the new image through out memory, with some care so that I can
use memcpy, and some variant of memmove to place the image at it's
final location in memory.   This is where all of the memory allocation
happens.
Then there is sys_reboot(LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_KEXEC), (or a kernel panic)
which triggers the work.  And except for cpu state changes nothing
happens.

Right it is not hard to do it just takes a little more work.
