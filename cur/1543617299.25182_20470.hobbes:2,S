Others have asserted that this kind of autoconfigure facility for 
non-technical people isn't necessary.
I assert that it is actually harmful, and will make their life more 
difficult.
My father's computer runs Linux. He doesn't need to recompile his kernels 
or do any maintenance - I don't even trust him to run up2date for himself. 
It's all he can manage to dial up and look at a web page so I can grab his 
current IP address out of my logs, log in and do the rest.
If I get a bug report from him, it's not particularly coherent or useful. 
Yet because he has a kernel binary which is identical to the one used by
many other more technical users out there, I can often match what he 
complains about with the more useful bugreports in Bugzilla.
If he (or even I) compiled a custom kernel for him rather than using the 
distro one, I wouldn't have a whelk's chance in a supernova of working out 
WTF he was on about.
