Hello list,
I'm currently looking into getting my smartcard driver to work. O2Micro was 
nice enough to opensource the driver [1]. The driver compiles without 
problems, and can be insmod' without triggering any problem. The main problem 
lies that it doesn't seem to be calling the ozscrx_attach function, which 
sets up the irq's and everything, thus causing the subsequent open of the 
device to fail with -ENODEV.
The laptop in question is an Acer TM803, with an 
in-the-cardbus-system-integrated SmartCard reader.
Does anyone have any idea how i can continue debugging this?
Thanks.
Jan
