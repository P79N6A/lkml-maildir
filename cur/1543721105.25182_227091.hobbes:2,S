OK, so download the original 2.4 version here : 
  
http://w.ods.org/linux/kernel/kmsgdump/0.4.4/
It still applies to 2.4.27-pre5.

Well, yes and no. Yes because it's useful, no because there are so many
other useful tools which would largely replace it and be more complete
(kdb, lkcd, ...) that one could wonder why it's in the kernel at all.
Since it's mainly useful to developers, and not too much intrusive, people
who need it can easily apply it to their tree.
Cheers,
Willy
