To generate even more helpful information, add these options to your
invocation of pppd
debug kdebug 1
In your particular case, if your /etc tree is like mine from RedHat, you
need to find the 
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ppp0 (might be another digit at the
end)
and make sure it contains the lines
DEBUG="yes"
PPPOPTIONS="kdebug 1"
That will log through syslogd the negotiation that takes place when pppd
connects to your ISP.
For the record, I'm running 2.2.0-pre4-ac1 with pppd 2.3.5 (was once
Redhat 5.2 dist) and it gets this message through OzEmail ok using PAP
authentication.
