BTW, let me expand on this one. The sg_list change was dropped, davem
and I decided to evolve the current scatterlist in two steps:
- add ->page and ->offset and have the PCI DMA mapping interface use
  that if available. This step has already been taken with the pci64
  patches.
- Remove ->address completely. This step must be taken to ensure that
  drivers will be highmem safe. Period. Don't know when we will do this
  yet.
