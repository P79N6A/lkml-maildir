first of all that 500 is a bit of a guess on my side; James (the Intel
wireless guy) is on holiday so I couldn't get real numbers out of it.
But as proof of concept it's pretty ok :)

the "problem" is that bioses lie about these numbers all the time as
well ;( (it's getting better but still).
Those numbers you gave, were those on batter or on AC ? (apparently for
the problem machines C3 latency goes WAY up when on battery, and then
the problem hits)
