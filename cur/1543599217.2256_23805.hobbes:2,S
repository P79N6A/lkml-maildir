Are there any known issues with 2.2.19+ide patchs and the Abit KT7?

Was running 2.2.18pre21/ prior and still getting these errors, but now
I've had two HDD crashes in the last week.
I just upgraded this system from 2.2.18pre21 tO 2.2.19+ide patches in
the last two weeks and its become rather flaky.
I'd had two HDD crashes in the last week, none where the system was any
all load. 
This is rather disquieting as linux is usually rock stable in those
situation.
The system basically freezes and the console disappears bus reset
messages, which aren't saved to the syslog.  On a button-reset the
Primary Master IDE HDD (hda) just doesn't exist (for the bios) and boot
up.  A power-cycle is required to get the system back again.
I didn't have a crash issue with this system prior with 2.2.18pre21.
Although I have also added a Dlink 4-port NIC and the system is doing
some IPSec that it wasn't doing before.
Is this hardware that's just gone flaky?  I'm certainly not trusting VIA
much any more, and Seagate are definitely way off my purchase list.
