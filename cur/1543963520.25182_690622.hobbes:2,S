I gathered that from the driver source...
I assume the PIO paths in the driver are intended for the Au1100, correct?
Should not be too hard to force PIO paths when no DDMA IDs are passed
through the platform device's resources.
Someone should test it on Au1100 though.

Unless someone else speaks up against it, I'll leave it the way it is.

Hm, sounds ugly, but I'll add something.
Thanks!
