Charles and Trond,
thanks for the advices !
I've upgraded the network cards of the linux machines to Gigabit 
ethernet cards and used tcp for my nfs mounts.
The problem disappeard so far so i'm pretty happy !
However i'm very disappointed by the throuhput i'm getting on the Gbps 
network :
When i scp a 473991492 bytes file from one machine to the other, i'm 
getting 14Mbps throughput, which is far less that 1Gpbs theoretical.
Looking at the network card info ( i'm using the sk98lin driver ) i've :
Mar 18 14:49:15 omnirot kernel: eth0: network connection up using port A
Mar 18 14:49:15 omnirot kernel:     speed:           1000
Mar 18 14:49:15 omnirot kernel:     autonegotiation: yes
Mar 18 14:49:15 omnirot kernel:     duplex mode:     full
Mar 18 14:49:15 omnirot kernel:     flowctrl:        symmetric
Mar 18 14:49:15 omnirot kernel:     role:            slave
Mar 18 14:49:15 omnirot kernel:     irq moderation:  disabled
Mar 18 14:49:15 omnirot kernel:     scatter-gather:  enabled
The switch i'm using is a Netgear GS516T
i've tried transferring to/from 2 linux machines connected to this 
switch using the exact same kernel and network cards and also to Mac 
Xserv using a Gbps card . They both yield the same low throuput.
Any hint of what could be causing this ?
Thanks in advance.
