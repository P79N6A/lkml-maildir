Yes, it's not stated in standards. Just like all ps-related stuff AFAIK.
Is it usefull ? Yes: programs doing this now with horrible hacks. Is it
possible to do in more clear way ? See patch and decide if it's clear enough.

Two answers:
  1. Yes, it'll make chance to lost password MUCH lower.
  2. With proposed patch you can implement "hideparam" command and then use
mysql from "hideparam screen" and it'll give you real security even if command
line will be used to set password. Users are demanding this constantly and I'm
not know why we should refuse such demands if it can be implemented real cheap.
