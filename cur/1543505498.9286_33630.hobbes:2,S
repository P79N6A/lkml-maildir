Moin!
The isdn-drivers included in the mentioned kernel is broken. 
I run mgetty from inittab to let users dial in to my system, but
every connection is rejected with "Protocol Error, unspecified (User)"
in syslog. Dialing into my own system via minicom doesn't work, too. 
Same error here. As a solution, I changed the isdn-drivers to the latest
snapshot available at ftp.suse.com/pub/isdn4linux (dated 10th Aug 99). 
This version seems to fix the mentioned problems.
Happy hacking,
	miSu
