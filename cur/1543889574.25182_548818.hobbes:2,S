Subject: BUG in 2.6.22-rc2-mm1: NIC module b44.c broken (Broadcom 4400)

Hi everybody,
The patch against b44.c contained in 2.6.22-rc2-mm1 has two consequences:
1. a tight binding to module ssb whose function or necessity I neither see through nor do comprehend
2. a breakdown (disfunctionality) of my onboard NIC.

Please note:
1. IRQ 255 looks very idiotic, doesn't it? It does not exist at all, does it?
Questions:
1. What is the technical need / progress of module ssb please?
2. If Andrew Morton's guidelines clearly say: "Do test your patches on three different machines" and this guideline seems to be strictly ignored by some sparetime hackers:
What is the master plan then to avoid the fact that such a crap is being sent in to Andrew?
Yours sincerely
Uwe
P. S.: There is an important saying going like this:
Too many cooks do mess up the pap.
Regarding the patch in mm-tree I can see SIX (!) Copyright owners.
The last one of them (i. e. the one of 2007) obviuosly does not seem to understand what he is doing (see that nonsense interrupt please, just incredible!) :(
In so far I would deeply appreciate Andrew Morton to throw that b44.c patch into the trashbox as soon as possible :)
