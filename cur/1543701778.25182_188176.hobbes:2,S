It's not a so similiar problem or is it.
I also have problems with gnome and freezing when using 2.6.0.
With my old 2.4.20 kernel all is ok. My problems starts with 2.6.0 
installation, which I needed for some hardware support. The new kernel 
works well in console. Have no errors in `dmesg`, not even in syslog.
If I setup a nework device and then also define a default route to my 
gateway gnome seems to freeze with it's first network access.
If I start net and then gnome, gnome needs to start over 20-30minutes 
and still did not come up totally. If I setup network in a xterm in 
gnome then gnome freezes after a short while, e.g. when starting mozilla.
It is no hard freeze, it looks like gnome is running on a 1 Mhz PC or as 
if it has time lack of several minutes.
But it's only in grapical gnome. In a console I can surf with lynx.
First I thougth it could be a gnome problem, but problems only come when 
booting with 2.6.0
