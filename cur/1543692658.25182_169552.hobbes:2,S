Excellent (hah, not again! what a cosy club we share) analysis.
I can't quite make the flaw I do see, fit the facts Klaus sees.
Consider unqueue_me on one cpu racing against this->key = key2 in
futex_requeue on another.  unqueue_me finds the right bh to lock
from q->key, but futex_requeue is shifting q->key beneath it.
Although futex_requeue holds both the relevant spinlocks, during
reassignment of key an irrelevant hashqueue may get calculated
and locked instead.
Whether or not this is relevant to Klaus' oops, it does need to be
fixed, doesn't it?  And your new key_refs version even more exposed?
I'm giving up on it, but expect you or Rusty will be ingenious enough
to rescue the split locks somehow.
(Oh, while you're there, be nice to fix nr_requeue 0.)
