Subject: Powerpc build unhappy in 2.6.20.4?

So doing:
  make ARCH=powerpc CROSS=powerpc-
Chugs along fine for a while, but then it ends with:
    MODPOST vmlinux
  ln: accessing `arch/powerpc/boot/zImage': No such file or directory
  make[1]: *** [arch/powerpc/boot/zImage] Error 1
  make: *** [zImage] Error 2
I.E. it builds vmlinux, then dies because there's no zImage, which it never 
tried to build...
Is there no working default "make" target for powerpc, or did I do something 
wrong?  Could this be a .config issue?
