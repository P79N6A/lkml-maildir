I concur with Eric's assessment.  Adding new magic bits to the generic
clone path seems like a poor way to cope with kernel threads.  I think
it's better if kernel thread setup gets less like normal user process
setup.  I also agree with Eric that PPID of 0 is a very natural way for
kernel threads to be displayed.  We need to know more about the nature
of the compatibility issue in procps to judge whether there is good
reason to avoid changing it.
Thanks,
Roland
