Thanks.  This made comparing the inh behavior to your web page and to
the classic code much easier.
I'm not sure reserving all 32 for 'regular' caps is the way
to go, since we're about to overflow the 32 bits of sysadm caps
already.  What about maybe 20 regular caps?
No need to do this now for my sake, but if you repost these, doing so
in 3 separate emails with the patches inline will make it more likely
that people read them.
thanks,
