Hi,
	I've been getting MCE's repeatedly today when trying to compile
2.5.75-bk1 on 2.5.75-bk1 (obviously I didn't have them yesterday when I
build my first 2.5.75-bk1 kernel on a 2.4 kernel).
	The MCE is always the same (I think) and reads like this :
CPU 0: Machine Check Exception: 0000000000000004
Bank 0: b600000000000135 at 000000000b99b9f0
Kernel panic: CPU context corrupt
	Which when decoded with parsemce gives :
[nim@rousalka parse]$ ./parse -i < mce
CPU 0
Status: (4) Machine Check in progress.
Restart IP invalid.
parsebank(0): b600000000000135 @ b99b9f0
        External tag parity error
        CPU state corrupt. Restart not possible
        Address in addr register valid
        Error enabled in control register
        Error not corrected.
        Memory heirarchy error
        Request: Generic error
        Transaction type : Data
        Memory/IO : Reserved
	I'd like to have some advice on what to do next. Is this a 2.5 bug ? An
hardware problem only triggered in 2.5 because it exercises the harware
in a different way ? Should I change something in the system ? If so,
should I change memory, cpu, psu, something else ?
	I don't usually build 2.5 on 2.5, but again yesterday was very hot and
hardware might have suffered (the best case cooling can not do much with
room temperature = 30+ °C)
	Any hint will be welcome - this is my first mce encounter.
Regards,
