Hi folks,
Andrew thinks that it might be a good idea to broaden the audience for
the guest page hinting patches. So here we go ..
The background for the patches is running a large number of guests on
a paging hypervisor with a high memory over-commitment ratio. We have
that situation on the mainframe running hundreds of Linux guests system
on z/VM. For hypervisors with a small number of guests the usual answer
to the memory over-commitment problem is a memory balloon in the guest
whose size is controlled by the host. For are large number of guests
the overhead to call into the guests increases, what is needed is an
alternative way for the hypervisor to get to memory without the
invokation of the guest system.

Only difference of this patch-set compare to the one posted on linux-mm
is that this patch-set is against 2.6.18-rc5-mm1. To go back to Andrews
question: is this useful for anybody else in addition to s390?
