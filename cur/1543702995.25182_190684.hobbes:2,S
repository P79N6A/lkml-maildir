Hi,
mm2 (or even mm1 or even vanilla, have not tested (long enough)) locks 
hard on my and someone else' machine. Sometimes we get this line in our 
logs before the lock happens:
kernel: Badness in pci_find_subsys at drivers/pci/search.c:132
Any ideas? Or do you need detailed kernel config and dmesg? I thought 
you might have an idea which atch caused this... My and his system are 
quite differnt. Major Common element seems only use of Athlon XP. He has 
VIA KT based system and I have nforce2. I thought it might be APIC, but 
I also got a lock up without APIC. (Though it seems more stable without 
APIC.)
bye,
Prakash
