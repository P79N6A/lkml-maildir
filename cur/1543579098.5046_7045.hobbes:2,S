Thanks,
Well they are a step in the right direction....
But they are still racy, especially on SMP.
The bad case is:
Process A in kernel space calls flush_dcache_page.
Then process B in a separate thread writes to the first word in a
cache line. The Process A writes to the last word in the cache line. 
Assuming the virtual addresses from Process A and Process B are of a
different color this gives two non overlapping writes with a well
defined meaning, which the kernel gets wrong.  In particular the ram
will only see one write or the other not both.
What it looks like to me is that SHMLBA needs to be extended to normal
mmapings, making all pages in user space
(page->index << PAGE_SHIFT) % SHMLBA 
virtually aligned.
And whenever we access a page in the page cache that is not
appropriately virtually aligned in the fixed kernel mapping, 
we can use the kmap infrastructure to map it to a better kernel
location.  If we reuse the same optimizations from flush_dcache_page
it shouldn't be any worse, and in the pathological cases it will be
faster.   While removing the races seen above.
Any thoughts?
Eric
