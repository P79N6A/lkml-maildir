Hmm, yes, this is ugly. But will it hurt? We'll just wait for number
of active fuse requests to go down to 0 before proceeding. It may
still livelock on system with busy fused-s, but we'll detect that with
timeout, and I believe it is 'don't do that' situation.

Great.

Ok, I'll just blame fuse here. 'You have to write to /sys
files for SIGKILL to work' is not funny.
