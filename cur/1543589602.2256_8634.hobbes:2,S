Hello,
I don't know what have changed since 2.4.4-pre6 or 2.4.3-ac13 which are
the last kernel I had tested before 2.4.4 which introduced that sound
problem...
I have a sound card, but I don't load the modules for it: I just use 
my DVB-s card from Hauppauge to watch TV or playing DVD.
It seems that's watching TV works, but I haven't tested it more than 20
minutes long, but when playing a DVD, in the best case, one could hear a
good sound during ten minutes, and then there is so much noise that one
could not hear anything at all?
What could I say more? Maybe lspci:
