I cannot produce (top of my head) any other POSIX API calls that
allow you to specify another clock source, but they are there,
somewhere. If I am to introduce a new API, I better make it 
flexible enough so that other subsystems can use it for more stuff
other than...

...adding more versions that add complexity and duplicate
code in many different places (user-to-kernel copy, syscall entry 
points, timespec validation). And the minute you add a clock_id
you can steal some bits for specifying absolute/relative (or vice
versa), so it is almost a win-win situarion.
To summarize: thought about that, but it is fugly and not too practical.
Consider also his allows you to write extensions to POSIX or your
own user-level APIs that could allow (following the fusyn example) 
you to wait on a mutex with a timeout based off a monotonic clock, 
if you need it (or something that makes more sense than this--highres 
comes to mind).
