Yes... I can confirm that the problem seems to be caused when you use
skins.... x11amp is now running fine without custom skins and freezes up
when I try to select a skin via the skin dialog box...
For now x11amp users can just edit the .x11amp/.config file in your home
directory and remove the SKINS line. 
And on another note, has any one gotten the sound in quake to work? Now
instead of the screech I just get a segfault in svgalib :/
BTW, the speed improvementsin 2.1.131ac2 (and 131) are very noticable on
my P166... anyone clock 2.1.x lately and compare it with 2.0.x?
Happy Holidays...
