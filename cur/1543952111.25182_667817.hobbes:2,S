It turned out to be due to incorrect NFS behavior if files are removed
between telldir and seekdir.
So it does work sometimes, but does not seem to correctly handle all
cases.  I have no idea if this is an issue in the server, the client
or the protocol.
What is certain, is that seekdir/telldir is a really bad interface,
that just makes life difficult for filesystem implementors, without
any real gain.  It deserves to die.
