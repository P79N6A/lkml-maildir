Just tried reverting the one change I made, which was to the BIOS to
disable power management.  Poof.  2nd CPU shows up when I reboot.
The dmesg flood is still going on, though.
Also, the motherboard is an Intel DK440LX (not a 440DX-based chipset).
Any other infor people need, or suggestions on what to look for to track
down the reason SMP won't work unless power management is enabled?
I'm assuming that means APM, considering when the motherboard was made...
