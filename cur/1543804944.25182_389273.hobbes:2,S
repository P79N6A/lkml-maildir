I wasn't getting much of a response on lkml to this, so maybe netdev will 
be more helpful :)
thanks

Subject: proper way to deal with a sparse warning
I'm getting the following sparse warning:
drivers/net/gianfar_mii.c:165:16: warning: incorrect type in  
assignment (different address spaces)
drivers/net/gianfar_mii.c:165:16:    expected void *priv
drivers/net/gianfar_mii.c:165:16:    got struct gfar_mii [noderef] * 
[assigned] regs<asn:2>
This is line 165 of gianfar_mii.c:
         new_bus->priv = regs;
new_bus->priv is of type void *.  regs is of type struct gfar_mii  
__iomem *.
Is it acceptable to do the following:
	new_bus->priv = (void __force *)regs;
