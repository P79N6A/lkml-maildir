As pointed out several times this claim in the changelog is incorrect.
Please fix it.
A correct description would be:
- This patch wastes memory of one configured cache line for each CPU 
on systems with less than 8 cores (e.g. 896 bytes on a 1 core system
with CONFIG_GENERIC_CPU/ cache line size 128)
It saves some memory on systems with more than 8 cores (one cache
line size for each core above 8)
