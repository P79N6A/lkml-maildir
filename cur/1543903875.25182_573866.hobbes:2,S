maybe, but for early debug users (the reason we wanted this
originally), it wouldnt be an oops in progress ... but i guess we can
just as easily set oops_in_progress to 1 in our code before calling
this function to keep from having to worry over locks from being
doubly grabbed.

fair enough ... my php side likes to overload the meaning of length :)

the idea originally was to have a buffer based function and an index
based function due to the idea of copying chunks of the log at a time,
but i kind of forgot about that once was all said and done.  now that
i look at it, unless the buffer based function dives into the log
internals to figure out how to split the copy based on the log
wraparound, there's no need for it.
log_buf_len is already the variable used to track the size, so the
function is called 'log_buf_get_len()' ...
