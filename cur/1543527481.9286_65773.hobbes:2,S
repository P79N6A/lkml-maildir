Here is tcpdump, started from /etc/rc.d/inet1, after eth0 is up,
but before the route is added. It should record all the traffic
during the boot until I can log in and kill the task.
The node called boneserver is my nameserver (Linux). The 10.1*...
machines are the M$ Machines that I am getting blamed for killing.
I probably should re-do this with `tcpdump -qtvn`, but I'll wait
for advice. I can re-do the startup any time.
Cheers,
