I do recall there is one issue on which Con wouldn't budge -- anything
that involved boosting certain kinds of processes in the kernel. He
said that it would defeat the whole point of the way he had designed
it, and that nicing could work just as well. Perhaps there could have
been a better way of handling that issue, such as adding (yet another)
kernel compilation configuration option for this code (since Con
didn't believe it would help all users).

I don't know how you can blame Con for not finding a PPC oops before
SD was merged into -mm, considering he seemed to be coding solely on
an x86-based architecture. Of course, you could say that his design
should have factored in all the architectures and such, but even the
best design can fall apart if it doesn't get tested somewhere. Again,
this is probably a subjective case in that Con might have pushed SD to
-mm rather early; but considering the readership of his -ck list, I
don't think it would have been tested on anything other than X86 until
it went into -mm because I've ever seen anyone on -ck report "it works
on <something other than x86/x86-64/IA64>". I don't know what made it
on to other lists, but Con tried his best to fix this oops, and unless
it was done privately, this oops was never re-reported. (Now, if SD
was _STILL_ causing this oops on PPC, I can see how this might be a
concern.)

So if we found a better maintainer who would commit to maintaining the
SD patches, would you still be willing to consider merging them? Is
this what you're saying?
