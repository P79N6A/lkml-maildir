Well... It might actually work, but the algorithm will require the use of
two special CPU instructions not present in most (all?) modern CPU
instruction sets: RUI (Read User Intention) and RAI (Read Administrator
Intention), as well as a complex instruction removed from basic CPU
archetecture when the CPU was invented: DWIM (Do What I Mean)
With the use of these special programming instructions (perhaps
implimented on a special expansion module) the system will automagically
reconfigure itself to match the user's wishes, play Bethoven's 9th
symphony on the system fixed disk drives by modifying platter spin rates
and head positioning paramaters, make toast, and wash dishes.
