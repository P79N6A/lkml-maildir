Let me start off by saying that this is the thrid problem I've
encountered as of late.  Basically the company I work at wishes to
use linux for on-air related activities (company = the weather channel).
The first two problems:  TCP hang and NFS related kernel panics.
Alan pointed out that AA found and fixed the TCP hang and all
will be cool in 2.2.15;  NFS serving being unstable with non-linux
clients was pointed out to me as well.  I applied the NFSv2-stable
patches against 2.2.14 (from source-forge), and no more NFS related
panics.
(Btw, I had to switch email accounts, twc's email server is down too
much.  Sorry if anyone got a bunch of bounces).
Anyway, the new panic happened at the wee hours of the morning
when no-one was doing anything.
I have kernel 2.2.14 with two p3 500's.  We use a megaraid controller
although raid is not being used.  We have one Sun DLT tape drive
hooked up (/dev/st0).  We have 256mb ram
The only way the kernel has been modified is NFSv2-stable patches
were applied;  they were grabbed from sourceforge (by having
cvs diff their 2.2.14 patched versus raw 2.2.14).
The panic says that the idle task was attempted to be killed, and
we were in the swapper at the time.  I can't say if something was
running us low on memory because the machine had panic'd by
the time I got there -- so if something was causing alot of swapping,
I don't know.
Enjoy the oops below (which had to be hand typed into a file,
so yes, it could be copied wrong):
ksymoops 2.3.3 on i686 2.2.14.  Options used
     -V (default)
     -k /proc/ksyms (default)
     -l /proc/modules (default)
     -o /lib/modules/2.2.14/ (default)
     -m /boot/System.map-2.2.14 (specified)
Warning (compare_ksyms_lsmod): module nfsd is in lsmod but not in ksyms,
probably no symbols exported
