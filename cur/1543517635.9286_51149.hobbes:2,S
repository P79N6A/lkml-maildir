This is just enforced of course.

This must be enforced to achieve security (also the very silly quota issue
will be addressed), I agree with you. I agree to change this. I also don't
think the breakage would be noticeable in real world.

Yep. I was just going to suggesting you this after I read you was
concerned about security and you disabled hard links in first place.
Hard links are incredibly useful and it make no sense to disable them only
for security issues as security can be addressed by forbidding changing
the inode->i_link by users that can't change all other fields of the
inode.
