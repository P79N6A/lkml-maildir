Hi,
Things are similar for x86, but I didn't consider it a problem.
The alternative I see is to is to introduce DATAENTRY and DATAEND
for use with data objects in generic code, equal to ENTRY/END. Then
deprecate the use of ENDPROC, so we can try to get rid of it in the
long run.
Minor nit is that all archs need to override ENTRY and/or END to
include an assembly directive that indicates that the symbol is
a function. Changing this in generic code is not possible as long
as there are ARCHs which have not been converted.
ENDPROC might stick for a very long time, though.
