Please feed it to scripts/Lindent. It will at least place all curly bracers
right.

IMO, useless comments.

Well, we see it's a variable and it's global in this file.

You can also remove " = 0" and make it go to .bss.

Unneeded initialisation.

Unneeded initialisation.

There is no Infineon.h

return 0; everywhere, please.

Remove this silly banner.
	dev_info(&pci_dev->dev, ": TPM found: "
				"io base 0x%x, "
				"chip id %02x%02x, "
				"vendor id %x%x (Infineon), "
				"product id %02x%02x"
				"%s\n",
		tpm_inf.base,
		version[0], version[1],
		vendor[0], vendor[1],
		vendor[2],vendor[3],
		((vendor[2] == 0) && (vendor[3] == 6)) ? " (SLD 9630 TT 1.1)" : "");
should be enough. BTW, care to explain why something called "chip id" is in
something called "version" and something called "product id" in in something
called "vendor"?

Useless comment.

Will always print 0. Could you please also remove Studly Caps from debug, info
and error messages?

Trailing space. Why be sorry? :-)
