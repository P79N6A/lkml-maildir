You can rely on those to increment and count events if it does not matter 
that we may miss an event once in a while. And I think that is the case 
here.
The counters may only switched off for embedded systems. We could just 
remove the CONFIG option if necessary. The event counter operations are in 
critical paths of the VM though and I would think that embedded systems 
with no need for vmstat want those as efficient as possible.
