Others have had made good use of symmetric encryption with OpenPGP
(the CAST5 cipher seems most interoperable).  New symmetric keys are
distributed twice per year, using the participants OpenPGP public
keys.
(There are also various implementations of reencrypting mailing lists,
but they cannot ensure end-to-end encryption.)
