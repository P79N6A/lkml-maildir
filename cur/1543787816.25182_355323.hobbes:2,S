My experience with oskit (trying to let students use it for OS course
homework) is quite ... underwhelming. It works as long as you try to use
it exactly like the developers did and breaks on a slightest sidestep
from that road. And there's not much documentation so it's hard to learn
where that road might be.
Switched to Linux/BSD code hacking with students, the code that actually
works.
YMMV.
