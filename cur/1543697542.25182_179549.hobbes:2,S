Subject: [ANNOUNCE] udev 007 release
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I've released the 007 version of udev.  It can be found at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-007.tar.gz
udev is a implementation of devfs in userspace using sysfs and
/sbin/hotplug.  It requires a 2.6 kernel to run.  Please see the udev
FAQ for any questions about it:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-FAQ
Note:
	The CALLOUT rule format has changed.  If you have a config file
	using this rule, please change it to follow the new order.  See
	the man page for the proper style.
The major changes since the 006 release are:
	- better parsing of the udev.permissions file
	- string owner and group names in the udev.permissions file will
	  now work if you build against glibc.
	- fix the CALLOUT rule to look the same as the other rules.
	- add format char for CALLOUT rule output
	- support arguments in callout exec
	- add ability for CALLOUT program to accept format modifiers.
	- drop Makefile.klibc.  To build using klibc, use:
		make KLIBC=true
	- updated man page documenting new changes.
Again, many thanks to Kay Sievers, for lots of great patches in this
release.  Thanks also to Marco d'Itri and Olaf Hering, both of whom
submitted patches for this release.
I think with the ability to capture the output of the CALLOUT rule,
combined with the ability to put format modifiers in the CALLOUT program
string, we now have everything in place to emulate the existing devfs
naming scheme.  Anyone want to verify this or not?
The full ChangeLog can be found below.
udev development is done in a BitKeeper repository loacated at:
	bk://linuxusb.bkbits.net/udev

Many thanks to Dave Jones for managing this.
thanks,
