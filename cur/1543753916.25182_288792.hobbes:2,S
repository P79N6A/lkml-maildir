The following is an edited output of dmesg, for a dual Xeon running 2.6.9:
Detected 1196.514 MHz processor.
<snip>
Calibrating delay loop... 2383.87 BogoMIPS (lpj=1191936)
<snip>
CPU1: Intel(R) Xeon(TM) CPU 2.00GHz stepping 09
I'm a bit confused why a 2GHz chip gets detected as a 1.2 GHz cpu.  Is 
this something strange in my hardware?
