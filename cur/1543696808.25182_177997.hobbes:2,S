Well, there is a good argument for not bothering with the 
"cdrom_get_last_written" at all: the SCSI layer never does anything like 
that as far as I can see, so arguably everybody who ever used ide-scsi 
would only ever have seen the READ_CAPACITY command be used. And nobody 
ever complained about bad capacitites as far as I can remember..
But I might have missed something in the SCSI driver. But I actually see a
		if (cdrom_get_last_written(..)
in sr.c, and it's been #if 0'ed out since before the Bitkeeper tree 
started. And that code definitely does the READ_CAPACITY first.
The "sd.c" code (which is what a MO device would use) obviously doesn't do 
cdrom_get_last_written either - it just does a READ_CAPACITY. (Well, it 
does a READ_CAPACITY_16 if it hits a really big disk, but that only hits 
if the disk has more than 4G sectors, so we can ignore it for CD-ROM's for 
a while.
So I'd argue for just dropping the cdrom_get_last_written() call entirely.
