I wish life were that simple.  Unfortunately, struct page isn't the only 
problem with these abominations: the system can run out of kvm for 
vm_area_struct, task_struct, files...  Personally, I *never* want to see 
those data structures being kmap()'d as it would hurt kernel code quality 
whereas a 4G/4G split is well confined, albeit sickening.
