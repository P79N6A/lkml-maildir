Do you know Google?... And best for such type of questions are newsgroups
at news.vmware.com, especially one named vmware.for-linux.experimental.
And if you do not know Google, you need to know
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/vmware
 ...  You can also use
http://platan.vc.cvut.cz/ftp/pub/vmware,
 but ftp is preferred access
method, so people with broken NATs are separated first...
