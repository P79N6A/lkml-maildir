I get the following results:
wh@frodo:~ > ./test /home/wh
Did 14137 loops in 2.99 seconds (4724.35 loops/sec)
wh@frodo:~ > ./test /tmp
Did 15923 loops in 2.99 seconds (5322.36 loops/sec)
wh@frodo:~ > ./test /usr/local/tmp
Did 28783 loops in 3.00 seconds (9596.10 loops/sec)
/home and /tmp are on the same ext2 partition (486M, 84% filled)
/usr is an (soft-)raid0 array (4G, 81% filled, 2 disks)
There is virtually no disk access during the test, the results are stable
over many runs.
Yet there is one big question: Why is the raid0-array twice as fast when
there is no disk access???
