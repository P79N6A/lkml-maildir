You could do this quite easily with clone() and a small assembly wrapper.
The assembly wrapper needs to do the last two lines without touching the 
stack in the parent.  That is usually quite trivial, even on 
register-starved architectures; for example, on i386 it would look like 
(ignoring vsyscalls for the moment, which are only an optimization anyway).
__detach_from_parent:
	pushl	%ebx
	movl	$__NR_clone, %eax
	movl	$CLONE_VM|SIGCHLD, %ebx
	xorl	%ecx, %ecx
	int	$0x80
	cmpl	$-4096, %eax
	ja	1f
	andl	%eax, %eax
	je	2f
	# Parent process, must _exit(0)
	xorl	%ebx, %ebx
	movl	$__NR_exit, %eax
	int	$0x80
	# _exit() should never return
	hlt
1:	# Error on fork(), set errno and return -1
	negl	%eax
	movl	%eax, errno		# Or TLS equivalent
	orl	$-1, %eax
2:	# Child process jumps here with %eax == 0 already
	popl	%ebx
	ret
