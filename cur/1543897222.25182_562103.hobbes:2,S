Actually, I surprised Lars a lot by telling him ln /etc/shadow /tmp/
allows any user to make AA ineffective on large part of systems -- in
internal discussion. (It is not actually a _bug_, but it is certainly
unexpected).
(Does it surprise you, too? I'm pretty sure it would surprise many users).
James summarized it nicely:
# The design of the AppArmor is based on _appearing simple_, but at the
# expense of completeness and thus correctness.
If even Lars can be surprised by AAs behaviour, I do not think we can
say "AA is different". I'm afraid that AA is trap for users. It
appears simple, and mostly does what it is told, but does not do _what
user wants_.
