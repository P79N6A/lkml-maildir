Not true. This still could be valid C. Borlands (and every dos
compiler) do that for years, and yes it is possible to get right.

Yes. So it would not break C and it would not break unix.

Agreed. This is not the way to go. But it is possible.

No. Correctly-written ANSI-C programs would still work.

Well - and if we need it we should better buy ultrasparc.
