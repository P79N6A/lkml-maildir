 I am running pppd 2.4.0b4 so that should not be the problem. However if the
 problem is related to tcgetattr bogus failure, then I do not think
 pppd would be the problem especially since it is failing in chat.
 Does anyone know under what conditions a errno=5 (IO error) should be
 returned from tcgetattr(fd,&t) when fd is opened (rw).
