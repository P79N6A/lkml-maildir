Hm?  Ingo's patch replaces msleep(1) with udelay(10) +
cond_resched().  This is the patch we're arguing.  This was already
reverted (based on your report) on git.

Interesting...  What about udelay(1000)?  Then it'll be closer to
msleep(1).

Yes, we are shooting in the dark now indeed.  Honestly, I have no
concrete idea why the patch breaks the sound initialization.
It seems that Dell machines (or STAC codecs) have problems with the
initialization timing.  I don't think that all commands but only
certain some command sequences that are so sensitive to the access
timing.  We need to identify this.
Ingo's patch is basically a really nice fix.  It reduces the
unnecessary delay, especially improves resume speed much.  I'd love to
have it.  And above all, I need to understand what is the real
problem.  Unfortunately, I have no this hardware and the precise h/w
data, so must rely on testers and a guess work.
thanks,
