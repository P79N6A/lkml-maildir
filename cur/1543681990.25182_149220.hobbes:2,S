Ah, OK. Thank you. I'll take a look.

Sorry. I didn't meant to be harsh but I haven't seen anything but "ALSA 
supports emu10k1" or "emu10k1 is very well supported under ALSA." I just 
wanted to know how to get tone control under ALSA and no one seems to share 
that information. Or perhaps I miss a couple of e-mails from this list? I 
can't find this one for example:

Seems like LKML swallowed that one. If that's the case, and I missed someone's 
reply, please forgive me.
Best regards,
Norberto
