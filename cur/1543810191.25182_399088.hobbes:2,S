Subject: [PATCH 0/4] prepare for ->siglock safe threads traversal
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The main problem is that copy_process's error path and
release_task() share __exit_signal() which locks ->sighand
and destroys it, but we need to do __unhash_process() under
->sighand.
This patch series tries to solves this. It also tries to
simplify and cleanup the code a bit.
Oleg.
