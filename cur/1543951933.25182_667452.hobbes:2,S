Subject: [PATCH RT 0/6] lockstat measurement extensions

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
I'd like to announce extensions to the lockstat/lockdep framework to
measure the possibility of whether or not adaptive spins and/or lock
steals can happen within the rtmutex implementation's slow path. This
extends the common rtmutex functions to pass the depmap and friends so
that the lock_note_contention function can determine whether a
rtmutex->owner is live on another run queue. If so, then it logs it in
per cpu storage with the peterz's lockstat framework.
I had to extend a lot of function headers using some preprocessor
definitions to minimize the ifdef complexity, but it's still rather
complex even with some of the reductions. With that said and done, I'd
like suggest that a better method would be to add fields in the struct
rtmutex to pass values down to the lock_note_contention() function and
to contain state/events that can be post processed by
LOCK_CONTENDED*() macros instead. This was originally proposed by
Peter Zijlstra, but I had already decided to complete this track just
to see where it would take me.
This is a reimplementation of my own lockstat work into Peter's stuff.
I hope to pass it over to the Novell folks so that they can maintain
and take over development of this feature which will shine a light on
whether adaptive locks and lateral steals are useful in -rt.
Some results here:

I measure the total number of contention events printed out at the
very top of the listing and spin/steals within "[]" to the right of
the contention number for that lock. It's interesting how many steals
actually happen in that the percentage is quite substantial. This was
against a load of "find /" commands which hit inode locks pretty
heavily. irq_desc is interesting as well.
