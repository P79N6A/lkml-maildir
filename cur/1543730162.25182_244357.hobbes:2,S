It is what I intend to do, yet could you paste a working source code for;
- sniff data from a chosen interface
- put the same data in the same interface's inbound socket
If I could find how to do this via low-level libraries, I think I could
write an applet to do the mangling.

Why don't you patch the checksum when you change the IP?  It's just a
not of the sum the 16-bit words so take the old one, not it, add the
two 16-bits differences, re-not it and write it back.
