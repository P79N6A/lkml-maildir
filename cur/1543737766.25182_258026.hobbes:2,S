You're making my point for me.  If the bandaid (preempt) is not active, 
then the system can be accurated profiled.  If preempt is active, then 
it is potentially hiding trouble spots.
The moral of the story is not to use preempt, as it
* potentially hides long latency code paths
* potentially introduces bugs, as we've seen with net stack and many 
other pieces of code
* is simply not needed, if all code paths are fixed
