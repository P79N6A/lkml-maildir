Is the VIA IRQ fixup related to the "spurious interrupts" messages in
any way?  Googling the 2.4 threads on the issue gave me the impression
that it's related to broken hardware.  I think excessive disk activity
might trigger it.
Anyway it's low priority as the message appears to be completely
harmless.
