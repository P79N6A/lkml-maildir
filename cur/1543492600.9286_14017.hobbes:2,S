I'm running RedHat 5.2 (With kernel 2.2.5)
My problem is that when I set vga=ext in lilo.conf, the display is set
correctly at the beginning of the boot, but after a while (Rigth after done
mounting local disks), the display is reset to the ordinary large font....
Is there somewhere in the boot that the display is forced to be "normal".
