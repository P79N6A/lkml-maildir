Yes, that will be the case.
With a 64 byte cacheline size, 
page_cgroup: |----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----
cacheline:   |-------|-------|-------|-------|-------
So if you are accessing each field in a random page_cgroup, then it
will statistically cost you 1.5 cachelines (really: half the time, it
takes 2 cachelines).
If you HWCACHE_ALIGN this, it will cost you just 1 line.
Long live the size/speed tradeoff ;)
Whether this improvement is actually noticable is a different matter.

I actually still think padding struct page will be a good idea. And
hopefully we can get rid of the page_cgroups pointer out of struct
page in order that we can have both config cases padded to 64 bytes
and use the extra space for larger refcounters maybe ;)
I simply haven't tried to run a realistic workload where it would
matter a great deal. I have a feeling that the oltp workloads could
see some improvement, because they're mainly just using the kernel
for direct IO, struct page is one of the few data structures that
they actually spend any cache on.

Anyway, back on topic from my rant, yes I agree with Hugh: I think
there should be some demonstration of a speedup (even in a "best
case" situation), before spending more bytes on a common data
structure.
