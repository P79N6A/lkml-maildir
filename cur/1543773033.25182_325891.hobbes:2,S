IMHO, he means that the userspace would only see Unicode filenames, and the 
userspace could only give Unicode names back to the kernel. The kernel, using 
this global NLS layer would translate back and forth, and the userland 
wouldn't know about it.
Its basically the only sane way to approach the problem of getting the entire 
Linux community to convert to Unicode.
