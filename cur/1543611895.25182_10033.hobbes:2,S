I have a 2100S installed as a root device on RH7.1. In order to get it
working i used Adaptec's i2o driver instead of the generic one, to do this
i compiled a custom kernel and dropped it into the RH bootdisks, the
kernel i used was 2.4.10-ac11. I wrote an article for Linux Gazette on how
to do this (
