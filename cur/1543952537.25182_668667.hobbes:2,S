        I have a motherboard that uses the AMD am690g chip set,
which has a sound hardware called "azalia", which apparently is
controlled by linux/sound/pci/hda/hda_intel.c.
	The audio works fine under linux-2.6.24.2.  However, in
linux-2.6.25-rc3 (haven't tried earlier ones) through 2.6.25-rc6
(released a couple of hours ago), the audio is barely audible unless I
crank up my speakers to the maximum volume, at which point I can hear
the music playing relatively quietly.  In comparison, if I were to do
that with 2.6.24.2, it would wake the neighbors.  In both cases,
this is with the volume set in aumix to 100 in both left and right
(the maximum values).
        I haven't attempted to look through kernel changes from
2.6.24.2 to 2.5.25-rc3 yet, although I expect to over the weekend if
nobody beats me to it.
