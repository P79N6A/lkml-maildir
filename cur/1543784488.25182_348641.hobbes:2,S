'loglevel=7' should be sufficient, except that I have seen some
distro's init scripts change it during bootup, so just be aware
of that (or search for it).
I usually use loglevel or 8 or 9 (via alt-sysrq-N).  According to
Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt:
loglevel=	All Kernel Messages with a loglevel smaller than the
		console loglevel will be printed to the console.
so using a value of 7 would omit KERN_DEBUG messages.
		7 (KERN_DEBUG)		debug-level messages
