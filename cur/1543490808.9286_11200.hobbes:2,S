And the problem is..??? 64-bit readiness for Linux programs is a
necessity with Ultrasparc and Merced, which are definatly going
anywhere. The normal Linux port of a program, seems to be "make".
Linux isn't being 'led' to Alpha's. It's just another supported
platform. They could pull the Alphas tomorrow. There would still be a
lot of people using them as Linux servers, and most Linux software would
still work as written. And development would continue on x86, Merced,
ARM, UltraSparc, etc....
