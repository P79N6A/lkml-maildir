How are you going to swap in the key manager if you need the key manager
for doing this?
However, I'd prefer a system where you can't dirty mor than (e.g.) 80 % of
RAM unless you need this to maintain vital system activity and not more
than 95 % unless it will help to get more clean RAM. (Like the priority
inheritance suggestion from this thread.) I suppose this to least
significantly reduce thrashing and give a very good chance of recovering
from memory pressure. Off cause the implementation won't be easy,
especially if userspace applications need to inherit priority from
different code paths, but in theory, it can be done.
