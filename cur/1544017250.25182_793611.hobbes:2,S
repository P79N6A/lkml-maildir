Hi guys,
I'm trygin to install Perl 5.8.7 and it requires the asm/page.h file.  I 
found several page.h files in include/asm-* directories (speaking of linux 
2.6.28).  However, make headers_install does not install any of them.  The 
host, target and build platform is the one and the same --  
i686-pc-linux-gnu.  Why is the page.h file not installed?
Regards,
Angel Tsankov
