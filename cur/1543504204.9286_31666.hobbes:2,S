 Hmmm. What I'd recommend is running a script overnight; compile the
kernel over and over and over again. This seems to be the single best way
to find hardware problems in Linux. If you can compile, say, 50 or 60
kernels without a seg fault or other error, then you're probably safe
leaving it at that speed.
