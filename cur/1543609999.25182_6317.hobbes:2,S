The IP address being offered does not need to resolve; if I configure 
it to update my DNS, then at the time it's offered it will not resolve.
Here's the stanza from /etc/dhcpd.conf
                host banana
                        {
                                fixed-address 192.168.1.20;
                                option host-name "banana";
                        }
BUT the stanza's not required at all.
