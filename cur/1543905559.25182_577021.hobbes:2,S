Well, it's a 6 month old Dell Latitude, and PNP is most certainly there,
as a number of other things get configured using it as well.

% cat /sys/bus/pnp/devices/00:0e/resources
state = active
io 0x378-0x37f
io 0x778-0x77b
irq 7
dma 1
IRQ 7.  That would certainly explain why I was seeing massive timeouts
when the driver chose to use IRQ 3. ;)
I'll test-drive your patch from Monday's e-mail when I get home tonight.
