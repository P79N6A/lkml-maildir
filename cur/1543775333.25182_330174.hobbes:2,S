What divisions? Where?
void udelay(unsigned int usecs)
{
        unsigned int k = usecs/1024;
        while (k--)
                __udelay(1024);
        __udelay(usecs % 1024);
}
I see no divisions. I see shifts and ANDs.
I can code them explicitly:
void udelay(unsigned int usecs)
{
        unsigned int k = usecs >> 10; /* divide by 1024 */
        while (k--)
                __udelay(0x400); /* 1024 */
        __udelay(usecs & 0x3ff); /* mod 1024 */
}
Should be ok now.
