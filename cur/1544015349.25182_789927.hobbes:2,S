That, once all the glamorous comments are removed, can be solved pretty 
much with this much userspace code:
int waitfd(int flags) {
	sigemptyset(&mask);
	sigaddset(&mask, SIGCHLD);
	sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &mask, NULL);
	return signalfd(-1, &mask, flags);
}
int waitfd_read(int fd, siginfo_t *si) {
	for (;;) {
		if (read(sigfd, &fd_siginfo,
		    sizeof fd_siginfo) != sizeof(fd_siginfo)
			retrun 0;
		memset(si, 0, sizeof *si);
		waitid(P_ALL, 0, si, WEXITED | WNOHANG);
		if (si->si_pid)
			break;
	}
	return sizeof *si;
}
About the exit_signal, that would have made probably more sense for 
it to be a parent property, instead of childs one. And be:
	do_notify_parent(p, p->parent->exit_signal);
instead of:
	do_notify_parent(p, p->exit_signal);
After all, is the parent that is going to make use of the notification, 
not the child.
