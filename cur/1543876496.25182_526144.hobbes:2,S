It might make sense to measure idle ticks vs busy ticks too.
If it's idle cycles perhaps things can be more easily fixed by multi threading
the initialization. If it's busy cycles perhaps they can be converted
into sleeping cycles.
Perhaps you should tell the individual maintainers for those?
If they still have one. A lot of them look like old hardware
where there might be no working ones left, perhaps just deprecation
would make sense.

e.g. those just look like bugs.

That's many drivers initialized together for compatibility ordering reasons.
