It is evil to ignore standard features in favor of proprietary ones,
thus forcing software developers to be locked in.
It is not at all evil to provide new features.
Your logic is warped. Was it also bad that BSD added long filename
support? Any archive with long filenames would be locked in.
I could go on, but this is silly. New features are just fine.

You "forgot" this bit of my original post:
# ln -s foo bar
ln: cannot create symbolic link `bar' to `foo': Read-only file system
Perhaps you think sed will work? Send me a script you like...
(it is not physically possible to write to that filesystem)
