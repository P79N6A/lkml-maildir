The difference is space assigned to PCI cards or reserved for hot-plug PCI
cards.  You should be able to run a CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G-enabled kernel (such
as the Red Hat 2.4.x-enterprise kernels instead of the -smp kernel) and be
able to use the remaining memory, at the performance cost of enabling PAE.
Thanks,
Matt
