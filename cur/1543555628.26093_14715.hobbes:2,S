Hi,
I have dual P III 665 with 512 MB ram and IBM ServeRAID controller.
It has been running for 40 days without problems but yesterday during
system backup it gave me the following error to syslog:
kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device
kernel: 08:03: rw=0, want=631625768, limit=7912989
kernel: dev 08:03 blksize=4096 blocknr=1768519177 sector=1263251528 size=4096 count=1
with different want numbers.
After a while thise lines changed to :
kernel: EXT2-fs error (device sd(8,3)): ext2_free_blocks: Freeing blocks not in datazone - block = 1869575229, count = 1
After backup nothing else was printed. Machine did not crash or anything.
Only MySQL server hanged...
Is this serious ? What chould I do ?
Also I'm using RedHat 6.2 with kernel 2.2.16. MySQL 3.22.32
Thanks,
Janek Hiis
