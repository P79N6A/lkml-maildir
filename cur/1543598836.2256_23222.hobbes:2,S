It got really bad.  It would make "progress", but slower than I
can encode the bits on the platter with a hand magnet ;-)
Now, it's only "pretty bad".

Right.  Which ends up calling our friend, write_unlocked_buffers(),
which does locking, but it also holds the kernel lock the entire time.

It looks like the same patch as yesterday.  Did you attach the wrong
patch?  In any event, it doesn't look like it helps balance_dirty()
at all because the location is not retained across multiple calls
to write_some_buffers().
