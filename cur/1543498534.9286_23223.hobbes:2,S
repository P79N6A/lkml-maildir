Hi
  This part of your patch is incorrect:

Notice, that if CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL is set to "n" the CONFIG_NFSD question
does not appear. In effect you have CONFIG_NFSD not defined.
It obviously means that $CONFIG_NFSD is not equal to "n".
This part of your patch should be replaced by something like:
+  if [ "$CONFIG_NFSD" = "y" -o  "$CONFIG_NFSD" = "m" ]; then
+    bool '   Emulate SUN NFS server' CONFIG_NFSD_SUN
Regards
   Andrzej
