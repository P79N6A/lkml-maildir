We don't support PCI bus power management, so we don't have any idea
what the parent is doing.  Also, we don't have a pci bridge driver (one
that uses "struct pci_driver" to handle bridge resumes properly.  I'm
working on these issues.  I also have some changes in mind for the PM
model to make it more friendly to the power dependency problem.  So in
short, I think this is fine for now, as every other driver is doing it
incorrectly, and in general it is working ok for suspend and resume.
They're all broken in this respect, and we need to gradually fix them.
But first we need the infrastructure to make this possible.
I haven't decided yet, but we could probably hide much of this inside
pci_set_power_state().

Yeah, that's exactly what I had in mind.  As I understand, tulip_down
does tells the chip not to issue interrupts.  Then we unregister the
interrupt handler before powering down the device to avoid any issues
with shared interrupts.  The best way of ignoring interrupts is to
unregister the handler.  Do you still see a race condition?
