An smp_wmb() is just an eieio on PPC, which is pretty cheap.  I made
wmb() be a sync though, because it seemed that there were drivers that
expected wmb() to provide an ordering between a write to memory and a
write to an MMIO register.  If that is a bogus assumption then we
could make wmb() lighter-weight (after auditing all the drivers we're
interested in, of course, ...).

By magic IO space, do you mean just any old memory-mapped device
register in a PCI device, or do you mean something else?
