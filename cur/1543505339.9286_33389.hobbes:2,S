It would be very bad to boot 99% of a kernel, since it may well appear
to work. If there is any chance of that, this would be better:
p = (size+15) >> 4
if size < 0xffff0
        old_field = p
        new_field = 0
else
        old_field = p >> 16
        new_field = p & 0xffff
Then at boot:
p = old_field
if p < MIN_KERN_SIZE
  size = (  (p<<16) | new_field  ) <<4
else
  size = p << 4
If you don't like that hack (saving a couple bytes), how about a
low magic value? Anything too small for a kernel would be fine.
