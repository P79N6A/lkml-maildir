Like Lars, I too was under the wrong impression about this configfs "nodemanager" kernel component.  Our discussions in the cluster meeting Monday and Tuesday were assuming it was a general service that other kernel components could/would utilize and possibly also something that could send uevents to non-kernel components wanting a std. way to see membership information/events.
As to kernel components without corresponding user-level "managers", look no farther than OpenSSI.  Our hope was that we could adapt to a user-land membership service and this interface thru configfs would drive all our kernel subsystems.

Hm, I'm thinking a service might have a good reason to want to know the possible list of nodes as opposed to the currently active membership; though the DLM as the service in question right now does not appear to need such.
But, see below.

Right. I thought that the node manager changes for generalizing it where pushing into sort-of direction 1. Thanks for clearing this up.
