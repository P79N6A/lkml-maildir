gcc should treat
volatile struct whatever *ptr;
as a different case than
struct whatever * volatile ptr;
which is also different from
volatile struct whatever * volatile ptr;
I think (but can't find my K&R C book to confirm :) that the first case
declares the struct as volatile, and the second case declares the
pointer volatile (the third case declares a volatile pointer to a
structure with volatile parts).  So, the programmer should have the
choice, if gcc is dealing with volatile correctly.
Of course, that doesn't mean that the authors have made the right choice
:)
