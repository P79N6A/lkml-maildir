Against what? I might very legitimately hold a binary with all caps, and in
the above scenario I could doctor your header to my entire satisfaction
anyway. You'd need some central repository of legitimate capabilities...
and then the capabilities-in-(header|filesystem) are pointless

OK, so capabilities are useful only between reboots now, and have to be set
again each time?
Please, let's concentrate on where we are going. If your system can be
rebooted into an older kernel that doesn't know of capabilities, you are
almost sure to get screwed anyway.
