I thought LBA put an end to geometry nightmares !?
AFAIK the recent kernel has full support for the IDE hardware, so
the BIOS should not matter at all. ( except for booting )
I personally never had any such problems,
so this reports are a little bit confusing.
On a related topic , what other parts of the BIOS are being
used or depended on by the linux kernel ?
