I fail to see how sched_yield is going to be very helpful in this 
situation. Since that call can sleep from a range of time ranging from 
zero to a long time, it's going to give unpredictable results.
It seems to me that this sort of thing is why we have POSIX pthread 
synchronization primitives.. sched_yield is basically there for a 
process to indicate that "what I'm doing doesn't matter much, let other 
stuff run". Any other use of it generally constitutes some kind of hack.
