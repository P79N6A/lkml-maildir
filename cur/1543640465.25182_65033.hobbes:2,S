Ok. What PCI spec 2.1 says is, basically, that we don't need to worry about
such things. Writes can't be reordered - all the reads and writes are
in CPU (or any other PCI master) order, exactly as on ISA.
Writes can be merged on prefetchable region (so we don't necessarily want
to mark I/O MMIO as prefetchable, if the hardware doesn't like merging).
All writes can be posted, and they are flushed before a read initiated
by the same master (i.e. CPU) reaches the same PCI target (so it's enough
to readl() any region, either I/O or MMIO). Looks like we only need to
flush posted writes when there are specific timing requirements (something
like writel(reset); sleep 100 ns, writel(no_reset) - or when we want to be
sure that, say, card interrupts are off when we do something critical
elsewhere).
