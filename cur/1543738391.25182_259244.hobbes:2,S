Only if you will wrap the long lines ;)

An example of using a key press, while moving the mouse
would be to hold the ctrl key while moving the mouse to
make a non linear selected on any window environment.

the mouse active, but acting out of wack.  If the first

then a second numlock press will bring the mouse back to normal.
Failed to reproduce. It probably happens only to specific
mouse types or on specific mobos.

Mine is A4Tech optical with two wheels, although I didn't bother
to configure X to recognize the wheels. I don't need them that much.
