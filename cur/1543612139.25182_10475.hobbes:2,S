No. Binary runs from these blocks. Maybe you can force it to run from
swap by modifying these pages through ptrace interface, but it is
not supported. Just kill the app if you need these blocks.

No. Some will refuse to unlink running app (or another opened file).
Some will unlink it immediately, and app then dies when it needs
page-in something. Some works as POSIX mandates.
