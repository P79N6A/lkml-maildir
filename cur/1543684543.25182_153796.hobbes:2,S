Hi folks,
I get a reproducable system crash in reiserfs at shutdown
time, when my external USB disk is going to be unmounted.
Final words are
	kernel BUG at fs/reiserfs/prints.c: 339
plus a lot of more lines. If I umount the disk at normal
runtime, then there is no problem.
I would be glad to help to get this fixed, but before I
manually write down all the other lines: Is anybody
interested in this? Or is this a well known problem?
Regards
Harri
