The intention is able to support 48bit ext4 on 64bit and 32bit arch 
whenevern CONFIG_LBD is enabled (or when sector_t is actually 64 bit). 
It just seems waste of memory to support 48bit in-kernel ext4 blks on 32 
bit if CONFIG_LBD is disabled, since we won't support large device anyway.
ext3_fsblk_t was a unsigned long type before, which is always 32bit on 
32bit arch. Thus we convert the ext3_fsblk_t to sector_t and depend on 
CONFIG_LBD to decide whether we need 48bit in-kernel variables.(on-disk 
block numbers are always 48 bit).

avefreeb is ext3_fsblk_t type(sector_t type), which is 64bit on 64bit 
arch and 64bit on 32bit arch if CONFIG_LBD is enabled.

ah, sorry about the confusing, s_blocks_count (the number of blocks on 
this fs, on-disk) should be always 48bit value, and should not use 
le32_to_cpu() to read-in. That is being fixed in [patch 9/9] 64bit 
metadata support,  where we convert 32 bit s_blocks_count to sector_t, 
and also use mixro EXT4_BLOCKS_COUN(es) to read in the blocks count:

This patch[3/9] is just fix the in-kernel blocks type...We trying to do 
this incrementally: first, support in-kernel blocks type >32bit, then 
change the on-disk blocks type to >32bit.
