Could we please make this easier to use by having some common sysfs helper 
routine for this kind of "delayed_store()" functionality.
I'm not a huge fan of delayed work at all, but if we have to have it, at 
least make it one generic function rather than having multiple functions 
all doing their own workqueue logic for it.
