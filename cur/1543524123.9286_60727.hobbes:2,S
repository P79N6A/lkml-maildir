Yep, that did it! I'm currently writing these lines from within 
an X session.

Now we can put our focus back to the other little problems, like
flaky operation of the yenta driver (only initializes pccards after
re-inserting them). But this is for tomorrow. I'm too sick to stay up 
any longer (so no Super Bowl tonight for me)
