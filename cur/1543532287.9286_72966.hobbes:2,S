So perhaps I'm totally confused but here's what I think might happen.
Scene1: without need_resched checks
        Process A does a 4Meg write: kernel wastes  20 milliseconds
        copying data into buffers, releases the buffers to the i/o
        system and returns. Cache is pretty much blown.
        In the meantime 10 interactive tasks have all become ready for
        action and are nicely sorted on the runq. When process A tries
        to go back into user mode, it switches to the highest priority of
        these and each one gets a full slice, runs and goes to the next one.
Scene2: with need_resched
         Process A copies one block
         One higher priority interactive process becomes ready and
             we resched. This process rapidly returns to A
             which starts writing again , the second interactive process 
             becomes ready and ... 
             After each switch A wipes the cache, we have an additional
             switch,  and total compute time is much longer not to mention
             that we double the number of  context switches.
Scene 2 is not a disaster, but  ...
