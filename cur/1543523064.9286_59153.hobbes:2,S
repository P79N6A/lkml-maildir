Subject: is for_each_task broken on SMP?

for_each_task skips the first task in the task list, init.
But with SMP, init and only init can be cloned.
In the SMP case, shouldn't it skip pid==1?
kernel/capability.c cap_set_all() gets this right
but every other use of for_each_task
that I checked didn't.
