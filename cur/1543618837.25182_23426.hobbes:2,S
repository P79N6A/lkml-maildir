It's been a while since I tested with the eepro100 drivers (I switch to e100
about 2.4.4 due to some unrelated problems) so I cannot give a comparision
just at present. I will test the eepro100 driver tomorrow on one of the
servers and post results then.
I will also try Andrew Morton's profiling tips on another box with the e100
driver.
