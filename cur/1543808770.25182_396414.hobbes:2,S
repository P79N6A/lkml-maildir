why? is it really required?
doing it this way, you get all the issues with external refs we have 
with a weak isolation, i.e. pspace init can be seen from outside and 
inside (correct? or am I wrong?). This makes your approach eseentially 
the same as ours from checkpointing point of view BTW.

This more looks like you were trying to make less changes with it and 
avoid fixing issus which can arise when pspaces are fully isolated. 
Maybe I'm wrong.

which problems? Actually I can't see much problems with isolated pid 
spaces. And isolated pid spaces doesn't require hierarchy, since they 
are fully isolated.

And here you need to introduce new non-unix semantics, security checks 
on lookups, etc.
