	Some OS's will actually attempt to bring a system down to single-user
while keeping the network running and use the tty which requested the machine
be brought down as if it was console.  Besides that there is the serial port,
and hooking up a montior and keyboard, which is much easier than opening the
system up and adding a floppy drive, takes alot less time too, and can be done
while the system is up.

	Linux can, but unless the boot-floppy image made by the vendor
could (ie: used linux or loaded it's own drivers) he'd have to move
drives around into to perform the flash, talk about a pain.

	As I mentioned above, serial port and console are possibilities.  
Neither requires opening up the machine.
