And you are sure you have this hardware device?  Is that what the
sensors package for 2.4 uses?  And 2.4 works just fine, right?
If so, I suggest you ask the sensors developers on their mailing list as
this is a driver specific issue, and doesn't sound like a problem due to
the 2.5 port.

It's really looking like the driver is trying to talk to a device that
isn't present, hence the timeouts.
