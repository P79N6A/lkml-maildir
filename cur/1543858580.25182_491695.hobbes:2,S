I expect REPORT LUNS won't work for many SBP-2 devices. It is not included
in RBC.
We discover LUs properly from the information in the ISO 13213 ROM. We just
don't map multiple LUs of the same target to scsi_device's beneath a single
scsi_target. (We instantiate one Scsi_Host for each LU. I might implement
a respective mapping some day, but there is no bigger benefit of doing so.)

Yes, it's in the old driver. I haven't checked yet when and why it was
written that way. Will do so eventually.
Usually, the SBP-2 status block is used to communicate autosense data.
Targets which do so may not support REQUEST SENSE. Targets which don't
do so have to support REQUEST SENSE; I suppose sbp2's curious REQUEST
SENSE handling is badly broken for such devices as far as any exist.

OK.
