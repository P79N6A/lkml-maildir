Two things can happen:
1) the page gets ramdisk buffers _after_ we look at it first,
   in this case the page isn't freeable and will be moved to
   the active list on the next page_launder() loop
2) the page loses its ramdisk buffers after we look at it,
   now the page is freeable, but we won't see it again until
   it is moved from the active list to the inactive_dirty
   list again
Any side effects harmful enough to warrant complicating this
test ?
regards,
Rik
