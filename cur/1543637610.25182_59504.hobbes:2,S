To my way of thinking, this is still 'minimal' -- it's just a different
minimum.
It's the 'minimum' way to get the panic message out digitally, in such
a way that I might be able to recover it using a tape recorder or a
telephone. Actually, morse is probably that, but morse loses data and
doesn't have any redundancy.
And with a setup pretty similar to what acalahan posted, It can be
written with a minimum of complexity (maybe less than morse) and
hardware (still just pc speaker).
Anyway, I don't expect for other people to use most of what I'm going
to be playing with with this, and my (disconnected) vacation next week
provides the perfect opportunity for me to play with it all I want
without bothering the list. And I've got some mighty interesting ideas
now.
Thanks
