One more again.
5. dwc_issue_pending()
Is this needed?  The dwc_tx_submit might queue the descriptor, but it
should be issued automatically after completion of all descriptors in
active list.
It yes, it seems implementation like this would be possible:
* dwc_tx_submit() just always add the descriptor to queue list even if
  active list was empty.
* dwc_issue_pending() call dwc_dostart() and move queued descriptor(s)
  to active list, if the active list was empty.
But I'm not sure "chain as many as possible at a time" is really
better then "start engine as soon as possible".
