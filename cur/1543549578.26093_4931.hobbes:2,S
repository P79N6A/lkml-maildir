Subject: Oops: Unable to handle kernel paging request with kernel 2.2.12 and 2.2.16

Dear kernel development team,
I experienced two kernel oops this month.
Both of them happened while executing cron jobs at night.
Upgrading from 2.2.12 to 2.2.16 didn't solve the problem.
I'm no kernel hacker but if you look at the call trace,
you can always see functions related to the file I/O system.
Hope the crashlog helps.
Thanks in advance, Thomas.
