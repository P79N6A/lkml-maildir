The character device is a good idea!!!
But how would the device's mmap be implemented?
I know how the read and write work, but they copy the data from one space
to another, which would be slow if there is much communication. Because
this looses the benifits of shared memory
About the kernel linking, I'm not making a module driver, 
I'm trying to recompile the kernel after adding my file (kshared.c)
I guess I should be able to access all structures and functions in the
kernel, if I succeed to link correctly with the files containing those
functions and structures, but I'm not so good at make files.
