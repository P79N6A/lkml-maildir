Out of curiosity, are you using the stock gcc/binutils from the FSF,
or one of the distro toolchains?  When we were investigating which
compiler/toolchain to use for the LSB Sample Implementation, one of
the comments that I got from folks like Eric Troan from rPath and
others was that out-of-the-box compiler/toolchain had so many bugs,
particularly on non-x86 architectures, that they found they were much
better off using a distro-patched/bug-fixed compiler/toolchain and
treating that as the upstream.
There has been some requests to include cross-compilation
functionality into the LSB Build Environment, so I'd be interested in
seeing how your work has been going, and maybe there's some
opportunity to work together.  Is there a mailing list you have for
this project?
