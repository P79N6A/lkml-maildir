Hmm... I've taken a look at it, but it seems to me that they are only
used with "acknowledged multiple frame operation". Isn't it for ISDN only?
With Frame Relay, we rather use unacknowledged transfers and UI frames.
Of course, if we have an implementation using t200, n200 or other
parameters, they should be added to the structure.
