Subject: Bug in aic79xx_osm.c: synchronous mode not negotiated

Hi,
I have an HP tape library attached to an Adaptec
29320A Ultra320 SCSI card. While upgrading the
kernel from version 2.6.13.5 to 2.6.15.5, I found
that writing tapes slowed down from 24 MB/s to
4.5 MB/s.
Switching on debug mode in the driver revealed
that for both the tape drive and the autochanger,
asynchronous mode is negotiated with the new kernel.
After playing around with the code, I found that
there is a problem with function ahd_send_async()
in file aic79xx_osm.c.
Reverting a piece of code in this function back
to version 2.6.13.5 solved the problem (specifically,
replacing lines 1609-1632 of aic79xx_osm.c in
version 2.6.15.5 with lines 4240-4263 in version
2.6.13.5). Synchronous mode is now negiotiated
for both targets.
Of course, I have no idea about any potential
side effects of this change, so I would rather
give this problem back to the maintainers of this
code. Feel free to contact me if you need more
information. Please, cc: to the address above,
as I am not a regular subscriber to this list.
Best wishes,
