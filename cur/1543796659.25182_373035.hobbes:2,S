Yes and no.
Reverting your patch won't fix the problem because scsi_put_command()
will then relinquish the last reference to the device and trigger the
same warning.  Additionally, blk_run_queue now stands a good chance of
running on a freed queue which could trigger a panic.
The problem seems to be that device_del() is apparently requiring user
context, if that's true, this will bite us not only here, but all over
the place ... in fact the fix might have to be to do the target reap
through a workqueue.
Regardless, your patch isn't the culprit here, it's just the thing which
is doing the last put.
