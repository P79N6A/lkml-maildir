   any other ideas or preferences?
Hold the RTNL semaphore when making any changes, therefore
you know no items can be removed/added while you hold this
semaphore.
I mean, this is the most fundamental part of how the networking
locks configuration changes, I'm actually baffled that ATM
doesn't make use of it :-(
Please, look at how netdevice objects are managed.
