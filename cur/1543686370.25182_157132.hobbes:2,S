There was one nasty bug with readahead fixed in test2-mm5.  I
believe (but could be wrong) that it only affected filesystems that
were on "logical" partitions (software RAID, LVM/DM, loopback, etc)
under memory pressure..

If that's your problem, you don't have to worry once you get to test2-mm5 or
later with a clean fsck of the disk.  If it's something else, you still need to worry ;)
