No.
Becasue building kernel modules without using kbuild is highly 
discouraged and vulnerable for all sort of config related issues.
As a simple example the module may become unuseable if just one
change is made to the configuration because this changes
the parameters passed to gcc which again affects the code
being built.
Can you try to enlighting why you want to avoid kbuild.
If you have a specific problem then maybe kbuild already can
do what you need.
