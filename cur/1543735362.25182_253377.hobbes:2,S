I am not talking about someone  accidentally stumbling onto
something.  I was worried about someone deliberately
trying to exploit this - such people look at data above i_size
_because they can_, hoping to find something interesting there.
Something they cannot get at normally.
I am assuming that the "garbage" between i_size and the
page boundary is stuff left over from whatever that
memory page was used for earlier?  If so, it could be
4095 bytes out of the 4096 that was used to cache some
other file earlier.  Possibly someone else's confidential file. 
Or a piece of some network package that was processed a while ago.
