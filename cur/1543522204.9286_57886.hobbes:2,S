Urgh... Who maintains AP1000 stuff? ddv.c, in particular... They are doing
some rather nasty things - essentially they have an odd kind of RAID and
seem to ignore cache coherency issues. They have a sort of NUMA-for-disks
and assume that all of them are partitioned. In the same way. So they have
32 devices for local partitions _and_ 32 more for joined ones. I.e.
#(32+i) goes across the #i on CP #1, #i on CPU #2, etc. All this stuff
seems to be accessible for userland. Ingo, could you look at this mess?
It's in drivers/ap1000/ddv.c (with supporting stuff nearby).
