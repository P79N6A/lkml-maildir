Thanks.
But that's two large performance regressions (so far) from the multi-block
get_block() feature.  And that was allegedly a performance optimisation! 
Who's testing this stuff?

Is that actually correct?  If ->get_block() returned a buffer_boundary()
buffer then what we want to do is to push down all the thus-far-queued BIOs
once we've submitted _all_ of the BIOs represented by map_bh.  I think that
if we require more than one BIO to cover map_bh.b_size then we'll do the
submission after the first BIO has been sent instead of after the final one
has been sent?
