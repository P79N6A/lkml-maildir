Dear Mr. Cox,
Dunno if anyone has mentioned this before, but methinks since 2.0.38 be the
_last_ official version for the 2.0 branch of Linux, the version naming
convention after 2.0.37 (and before the last 2.0.38 version) be known as
2.0.37acX rather than 2.0.38pre-X.
In other words, instead of treating version 2.0.38 pre-9 as a pre-version
_before_ 2.0.38, treat it as an _enhanced_ version _after_ 2.0.37 and call it
2.0.37ac9.
What do you think, sir?
Sincerely,
Pete
