Does anyone besides me think this discussion is more than just a bit bizare?
Don't you think this is descending into the realm of the "religious" war,
something that has been quite prevalent lately?
Come on folks.  The people who matter know who RMS is,  what the FSF did,  and
really pretty much who did what.  No body made this stuff happen witout the
help of someone else.  If you wanted to persue the issues of who did what,  we
could end up talking about the work of Ada Lovelace and Charles Babage and we
would still have issues of priority.
We need each other.  The FSF has done lots of good and I'm very grateful to RMS
and his desciples.  Linus didn't just have a great idea,  he figured out how to
make "his" thing our thing.  There are too many people for me to name here.
There are many people and even organizations I haven't heard of that materially
benefit my life.  
So please,  if anyone is feeling under appreciated,  let me know and I will try
to come up with a good reason to say thanks.  
I like Free Software for all kinds of reasons (coolness,  openess,  idealism,
and yes the "no" cost reason too ;-) ).  I hope to contribute as my skills
develop.  I probably wouldn't be working in Information Technology if it
weren't for most of the people who have worked to support all this reall neat
code.  So please,  remember there are more of us who know what really happened
than who don't (those of us who use computers usually are quite literate (in
some language ;-) )).
