Hi all,
I'm trying to get an idea of the minimum compiler requirements necessary 
to build a Linux kernel, excluding parsing requirements.  For example, 
IIRC, some portions of the code depend on 'static inline' working and 
decent constant propagation/folding.
Are you guys aware of a list of such examples, either in your own head 
or written down somewhere?
If you're wondering what this is about, I'm playing around with "tinycc" 
(
http://www.tinycc.org/
) ...  it's nowhere near building a kernel, being 
basically a C parser that emits binary code, but I wanted to get an idea 
of the obstacles.
	Jeff
