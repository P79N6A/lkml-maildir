Hello,
I'm having a strange problem debugging a pthreads application in 2.2.18 
(as per SuSE 7.1):
gdb says the program terminated normally after having started two or 
three LWPs. I can exit gdb then, and I find (ps -ax) one zombie thread 
and two or three other threads. Is it more likely a kernel problem, a 
library problem, or a gdb problem?
Naively I thought when exiting the process, all threads would die...
