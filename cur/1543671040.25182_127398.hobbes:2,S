The GPL does allow you to embed a public key in the kernel, which could
enforce only executables signed with a private key from being run, or
only signed modules from being loaded.  Both of which are things that I
know a lot of people want to do (and I've done in the past, see
http://linuxusb.bkbits.net:8080/cryptomark-2.4
 for the 2.4 version of a
signed binaries are only allowed to run patch.)
I know a lot of people can (and do) object to such a potential use of
Linux, and I'm glad to see you explicitly state that this is an
acceptable use, it helps to clear up the issue.
thanks,
