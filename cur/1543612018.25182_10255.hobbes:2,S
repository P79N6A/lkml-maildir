Are we not talking about the 2.5 kernel build tree? My understanding of the
numbering of kernels is that the 2.4.x tree is stable; and the 2.5.x tree is
the new development tree
If the suggestion was to alter the 2.4 tree in a way that required
additional tools; I could understand the concern; the 2.5 tree is unstable;
and so to go from 2.5.a to 2.5.b I expect to have to be really carefull and
*READ* the release notes; similarly from 2.2.x to 2.4.x; but 2.4.a to 2.4.b
I generally detar the tree; copy my .config over check with menuconfig that
things make sense; build the kernel and expect things to work; release notes
you ask? ..I only glance at them to see if anything strikes my eye; but they
are not read completely
