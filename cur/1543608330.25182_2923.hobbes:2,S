Hi!
I've recently purchased a Compaq Presario 700 laptop that has a Via
motherboard with onboard audio.
When I load the via82cxxx_audio driver (kernel 2.4.12), I hear the
speakers pop, but no sound ever plays.  I'm check the mixer, and the
volume is up as necessary.  Interrupts are occuring for the device in
/proc/interrupts.  All the necessary (that I know of) modules are
loaded, such as sound/soundcore/ac97_codec.
I tried the ALSA drivers as well, and had less success.  For them, I had
to use the Via 686a driver (/proc/pci reports that I have a VT82C686). 
However, althouh the driver loaded, and I head my speakers pop, ALSA
utils reported that i had no configured sound cards, and no OSS based
utils worked (/dev/dsp and /dev/mixer reported invalid devices).  I did
go thru and make sure my ALSA /dev entries were created and correct.
So now I'm back to the OSS drivers, but still no luck.  If there's
anymore information I can post to figure out how to get this to work, or
maybe modify some drivers, please let me know what I need to do.  I
don't want to have to use another OS just to hear sound.  ~,^
Thanks everyone,
Sean Etc.
