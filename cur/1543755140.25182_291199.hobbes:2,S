Hi,
(third question to LKML today =)
I've recently bought an Intel SE7210TP1-E mainboard (specs here: 
http://www.intel.com/design/servers/boards/SE7210TP1-E/index.htm
) and I 
now have most things working.
There are however, two questionmarks left.
1) On the mainboard is a 6300ESB Watchdog Timer (pci id 8086:25ab), but 
there seems to be no driver available for it. Does anyone know if there 
is any such driver in progress or if I've misunderstood the situation?
2) IPMI, Documentation/IPMI.txt mentions a ipmi_smb driver, but I could 
find no such driver in the 2.6.10 tree. Am I missing something?
Thanks in advance for any enlightenment.
Regards,
David Härdeman
