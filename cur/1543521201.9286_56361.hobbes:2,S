That scripts are a good thing if used at the proper places is a
triviality.
In fact I find myself typing whole shell loops blind into the command
line sometimes. But this isn't the issue here...

If you ask me for my oppinnion on scripting languages then I can tell
you:
I love awk, sed and ksh. Tcl isn't bad too. But I hate perl, becouse it
get's
usually overused at places where a real programm would better fit. I
call it
the emacs of scripting... Anytime somebody wan't some wired perl stuff
on his
server one has too install tons of "packages" for his single buggery
cgi.
But again this isn't the issue here.
The issue here is: What is so inconvenient about:
echo "Free memmory is"`sysctl freemem`
in comparision the the wonderfull /proc based scripting you are talking
about
cat /proc/freemem | while read TAG VALUE
do
	case $TAG
	"FreeMem:")
		echo "Free memmory is $VALUE"
		;;
	esac
done
Written entierly from memmory for you just for show, don't please
expect them to work out of the box.
You see a proper system utlility doesn't exclude you from SCRIPTING
in any way! However you can argue that linux is missing such a good
thing
as the sysctl programm I'm reffering above too.

No I don't beleve... Just again go out and compare. Many of the
things which are tunable by /proc should be in fact statrtup paremteters
for the
kernel, setup much the way rdev was warking in the early days... and
many
are just there without any practical use. And then where is the
documentation?
I didn't call scripts evil in themself. I think that it's just entierly
a silly idea to fiddle around with kernel parameters by using cat 17273

and not using proper shielding tools.
This sound just like a "workaround" for the fact that there is no
coordination
in linux between the developement of proper /sbin utils and the kernel.
This is not proper interface design.

The chaos is in the first place and therefore there is the need
for this "chierarchy". Really get out there and compare linux system
tuning with FreeBSD.

You would have been surprised how much space you could sacrify by really
removing all proc related code inside the kernel. Last time it was
passible
in linux it was about 25k code. Remember those where times where my
entier kernel
only took 149k or such of text... Or just do size /bin/ps on a free BSD
box and compare 
the reslut's with the same on linux (assuming you didn't compile the 
procps lib as shared...) Why do you think we have currently  make bzlilo
instead of make zlilo now? 
The first race in /proc I can think of is for example the simple fact
that ps
doesn't really get a true snap of the systems state, there are chances
that
it will change under the feets of it...
Do you really remember how long it took until find /proc didn't hang the
whole system anymore?!
