I see the problem, and your test will certainly alleviate the symptom.
You are making the test has this process ever been a thread group leader.
I guess alleviating the symptom is all that is necessary there.
Grumble.  I hate that entire pid transfer case, too bad glibc cares.
If I could in the fix for this I would like to add a clean concept
that we are testing for wrapped in a helper function.  Otherwise
even with a big fat comment this will be easy to break next time
someone refactors the code.

It is at least not worse, so it is probably worth doing.
