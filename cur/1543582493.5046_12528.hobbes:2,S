In application program ,code for call to write system call is given
below...
      #include<fcntl.h>
    main()
	 { 
	  int count,fd;
	 fd=open("/dev/pseudo",O_RDWR);
	  write(fd,buff,5);
	  }
	  
In driver module code for getting the buffer and count 
    #include<all related header files...>
     
    int psuedo_write(struct inode*in,struct file*fp,char *buf,int count)
    {
      kprintf("<1>pseudo_write routine called \n");
      kprintf("<1>count=%d \n",count);
      kprintf("<1>buffer=%s \n",buff);
      return 0;
    } 
/******so here after inserting the module into the kernel using insmod 
pseudo.o and executing the application cc -c pseudo_app.c, the o/p on
console is *****/
"pseudo_write routine called" 
"count=9988345352" /*garbage*/
"buffer=@#%h" .   /*garbage*/
 
/*** but neither the  buffer is carried from user space to kernel space nor
the count, why?***/Please help me
out.
