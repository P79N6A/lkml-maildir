Ah, but the implementation I have submitted is the bare bones super
minimum POSIX implementation. Now everybody can add her own special
clock/timer to the kernel. For instance if I would want to add an IRIG-B
clock I just needed to write a device driver for the card and hook it into
the system call infrastructure I have provided.
It is not necessary to provide timer and clock functionality for each
CLOCK_<type>. Some clocks cannot generate interrupts in order to be usable
as a timer, but can only be used as a clock. In that case you just
implement the clock_* functions.
Secondly I remember that not too long ago I heard someone ask for greater
precision for the clock function gettimeofday. So someone is interested in
nanosecond precision. So there it is, go ahead, and implement gettimeofday
as clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, :-).
Thirdly, on SGI IRIX 6.5 for some clocks (e.g. CLOCK_CYCLECNTR), the
function clock_gettime() maps some hardware registers to user space and
reads them, instead of doing an expensive system call.
On an i386 you could maybe access the Time Stamp Counter from user space
and offer a user space implementation which just returns the value from
the TSC (after converting it to struct timespec). If SGI gets away with it
so could the Linux community. For superfast interval timing this would be
excellent.
