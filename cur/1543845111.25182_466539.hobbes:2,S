I got similar kernel message relating to an azx_get_response timeout
with an 82801G HDA audio running Debian kernel 2.6.16-2 (happened during
suspend to ram IIRC) - after replacing kernel alsa with alsa-source
1.0.12 (24 Aug release) the problem went away (in addition to making
sound come out when it didn't before).
Not sure if this info helps but trying the alsa-project release and
seeing if that works may help identify what needs fixing in mainline
hda_intel.
