Subject: [PATCH 5/5] libfs : file/directory removal fix, 2.6.18
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Fix file and directory removal in libfs. Add inotify support for file removal.
The following scenario :
create dir a
create dir a/b
cd a/b (some process goes in cwd a/b)
rmdir a/b
rmdir a
fails due to the fact that "a" appears to be non empty. It is because the "b"
dentry is not deleted from "a" and still in use. The same problem happens if
"b" is a file. d_delete is nice enough to know when it needs to unhash and free
the dentry if nothing else is using it or, if someone is using it, to remove it
from the hash queues and wait for it to be deleted when it has no users.
The nice side-effect of this fix is that it calls the file removal
notification.
