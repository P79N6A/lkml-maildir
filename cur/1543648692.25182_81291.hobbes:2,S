I realize the whole concept is different, but could extent remapping alleviate 
the need of an *intelligent* FS block allocator, as it ensure the best 
statistical-average IO perfs.
I can even imagine an *intelligent* FS block allocator being counter 
productive in the case of a heavily fragmented LV (extends out-of-order ...) 
because, after all, block allocator seem to take for granted that the device 
is linearly mapped over physical.
This whole point fade into mud if the block group object of an extN FS is 
mapped over an LVM extent. But even in this case the *simple* allocator would 
be best in combination with an extent remapper.
I don't pretend an extent remapper can replace the FS block allocator, but 
only *complex* block allocators ... and particularitly those that make the 
false assomption that underlying block device is made of linearly and 
consecutive physical blocks.
