Sorry for being dense, but can you say what "no more merges" means?
At the kernel summit we talked about no more git merges after the
initial devel period, and I'm wondering if that really is the policy.
As a concrete example, suppose I have a git tree with something like
 drivers/infiniband/hw/mthca/mthca_qp.c    |    2 +-
 drivers/infiniband/ulp/ipoib/ipoib_main.c |    2 ++
 2 files changed, 3 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
ie a couple of really small, simple fixes.  Emailing those to Andrew
as patches is fine by me, but it seems like it creates extra work for
Andrew and you.  So is email via Andrew what you want, or are "bugfix
only" git pulls OK?
Thanks,
  Roland
