I just ripped my machine apart, cleaned it out and made sure all the 
connections are snug.  I didn't find anything glaringly wrong inside, so my 
current conclusion is that my machine just gets too durn hot for the drive to 
function properly.  I'm going to periodically test my throughput to see if it 
degrades over time.  See if taking your machine down for a few hours helps 
things out.  If so we can yell at Maxtor, otherwise its back on the bug hunt.
Thanks to everyone who sent suggestions!  Hopefully I'm through with this 
hiccup. :)
