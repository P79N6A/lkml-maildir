Do you have any idea how insulting and arrogant this is?
Let me translate for you, how this arrived:
"O Ingo, who art our god of the scheduler. You have blessed the paths I 
walked in. You kept me from sinning numerous times. Your wisdom is 
infinite. Guide me on the journey that layeth ahead of me into this world 
knowledge of Your truth."
(I apologize already in advance, if I should have hurt anyones religious 
feelings.)
It's obvious that you have more experience with the scheduler code, but 
does that make you unfailable? Does that give you the right to act like a 
jerk?
I do make mistakes, I try to learn from them and life goes on, I have no 
problem with that, but what I have a problem with is if someone is abusing 
this to his own advantage. I have to be extremely carful what I say to 
you, because you jump on the first small mistake and I have to bear your 
insults like "there's nothing i can do about your denial of facts - that 
is your own private problem." I have no problems with facts, I'm only 
trying very hard to ignore your arrogant behaviour...
If you have something to contribute to this discussion which might clear 
things up, then just say it, but I'm not going to beg for it.
bye, Roman
