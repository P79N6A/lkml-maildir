It's really a namespace issue for user apps trying to deal with xattrs.
Being able to display the xattrs associated with a file in sane way,
like getxattr(path, "system.security", ...).  Otherwise something like
listxattr() then gettxttr(... "system.security.[blah]" ...).  Total
freeform naming is a headache for userspace to deal with.  Esp. since we
don't want to teach all userland tools about each individual module/policy.
There were a couple proposals to use common root like "system.security."
(or the trusted namespace which was discussed in earlier threads).
Would you still prefer module specific naming?
thanks,
