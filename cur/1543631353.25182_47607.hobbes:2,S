The thing is, we won't get Oracle to rewrite a lot for a completely
threaded system. And clone does _not_ come with a way to share only parts
of the VM, and never will - that's fundamentally against the way "struct 
mm_struct" works. 
Oracle is apparently already used to magic shmem-like things, so doing 
that is probably acceptable to them.
