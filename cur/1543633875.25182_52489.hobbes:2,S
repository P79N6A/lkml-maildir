This part of the patch (the change to kernel/sched.c) can be safely	
removed without making o1 stop working.
This hack (conservatively) fixes an issue where on bootup, the machine
would get into a page fault loop and hang.  This only happens a very
small percentage of the time.  I will investigate whether the patch
Ingo put out fixes this issue.
