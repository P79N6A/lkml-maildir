you seem to have some misconceived notion that this is somehow a 
"ReiserFS versus XFS" or "ReiserFS versus ext3" case.
l-k could do without those conspiracy theories.  lets just stick to the 
facts.

one of the nice things about linux is the freedom open-source gives you.
there is no reason why Hans cannot keep whatever proprietary mechanisms 
to do whatever fancy plugins he wants and you as a user can use until
