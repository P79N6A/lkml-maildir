Good points. It could be really difficult to trace the cause of those  
issues. But hard/too much effort != impossible. For every entry point to  
the module we have a known state of the system prior to and after the  
call. We could potentially checksum the whole of memory before and after  
and find out exactly what the module has changed.
Anyway, I'm going to drop this conversation now. Work to do :>
