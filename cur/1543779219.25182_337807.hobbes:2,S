latest Linus git tree, and it just does the usual entering suspend and
then when I resume I get crap out of the serial port, nothing at all
intelliigble...
Serial: 8250/16550 driver $Revision: 1.90 $ 4 ports, IRQ sharing disabled
ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A
And as I said its an i865 based motherboard from Intel... nothing
special on it, do you need to know the super-io chip, i.e. I 'll have
to open the case to find out...
Dave.
