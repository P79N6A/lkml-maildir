Hummm, from what i gathered from reading this list it has a 'standoff
period' (like you said after getting data but also) before it initiates
a read... And afair, CFQ did just about 'nothing' when the disk wasn't
under 'load'.
I also thought that deadline didn't merge and sort on the same level as
AS.

Ahhh

Yes, but... 
I was more referring to the stalls in AS (the waits). If one could
eliminate them and just enable AS when the disk is loaded... Then we
could add all the 'bonus on wait' and or process priorities being
honored etc, atm, it just feels like overhead, it might be small but
still.
And, if sfq would build up one queue and feed it to AS, don't you think
there would be a gain? Esp in small reads when not loaded and scattered
small reads... Aswell as during heavy load?
