nonsense.
 /dev/mem exists for example, but you are still not supposed to go
bang all over the place in it.

Dunno, something less scary, like knowing where your sensors are on a
given machine... honestly, it's just scary the risk you guys are taking
by banging random IO ports.
At the very least, that shouldn't be done on non-x86.

It wouldn't, but at least I could NAK it or make it CONFIG_X86 :-)
