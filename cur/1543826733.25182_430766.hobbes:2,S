I am trying to boot with 2.6.16  kernel at my desktop running fedora
core 4 . It does not boot without initrd generating the message "VFS:
can not open device "804" or unknown-block(8,4)
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel panic - not syncing : VFS:Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(8,4)
I have disabled the module support & built in all modules/drivers for
ide/scsi/sata but it does not boot. I have to disable the module as I
need a statically built  kernel.
If someone could describe the way to boot without initrd it will be great.
Thanks in advance for your cooperation.
