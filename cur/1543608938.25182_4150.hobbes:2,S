Thought that too untill a minute ago. Went to the Intel site and read the
information.
http://developer.intel.com/software/products/eval/
Gives details about _two_ ways to get it free. The known 30 day free trial
with support but also a less known "non commercial unsupported" option. So
for non-commercial use you can use it as much as you want, you just don't
get support.
Downloading it now to play some with it :-)
