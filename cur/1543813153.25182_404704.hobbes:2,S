It already is... for most of the arches except x86_64.
And on -mm, the asm-generic version uses atomic_long_t for local_t (signed
long) which seems right.
Although, I wonder why we use:
#define local_read(l) ((unsigned long)atomic_long_read(&(l)->a))
It would return a huge value if the local counter was even -1 no?
