I have seen ios_in_flight as low as -4 already.

The use (one of the most important values here) is also completely wrong
when ios_in_flight is too low: Whenever ios_in_flight!=0, the disk is
accounted as running.
I have patched gen_partition_disk() to correct the ios_in_flight value
as a workaround. This is better than checking it each time ios_in_flight
is decremented, because it only happens when someone reads
/proc/partitions, and so it doesn't slow down the disk access.
But I'm still trying to reproduce the cause of the problem.
