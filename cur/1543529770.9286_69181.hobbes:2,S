Hello,
I've tried Kernel 2.3.51 and run into two problems. The first is, that my
DEC Tulip 21140 does not work. No special error messages. I remember that
also with 2.3.44 that card does not work.
The second problem is that squid 2.2.5 does not start: 
Starting proxy server: shmget: shm filesystem not mounted
IpcMemoryCreate: shmget failed (Invalid argument) key=5432010, size=120,
permission=700
shmget: shm filesystem not mounted
IpcMemoryIdGet: shmget failed (Invalid argument) key=5432010, size=120,
permission=0
IpcMemoryAttach: shmat failed (Invalid argument) id=-2
FATAL 1:  AttachSLockMemory: could not attach segment
squid.
Regards, Norbert
