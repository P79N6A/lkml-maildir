Well that one appears to be a dummy place holder and probably should at
least have a kzalloc to initialize all of the fields to know values.
Regardless the normal pci device allocation does use kzalloc so we will
have well defined if not beautiful behavior if we try and use it.
Until we have a case where we need to use the msi_list outside of 
where we enable and disable msi we should be perfectly fine initializing
the list somewhere inside of pci_enable_msi, and pci_enable_msix.
With dev->msi_enabled and dev->msix_enabled serving as flags to the
rest of the world that it is safe to look at the list.
It certainly sounds safer to me then becoming to closely coupled with
code that doesn't really care about how msi works.  Heck even though
we repeat the call twice I bet it will even be less code.

This should be "unsigned int irq"
