Since 1992, lkml (with "Cc:" to the appropriate subsystem mailing list
if applicable) and the presumed responsible parties are the only channels
I've used to report the bugs I encounter.
Other methods come and go, but old habits die hard, particularly when
they have a knack for producing the desired result.  Historically,
requiring a developer to fire up a GUI to read a bug report decreases
the chance that bug report will be noticed.  The development community
can do whatever flips its collective switch as far as tracking bugs,
but the bugs have to be reported and noticed before tracking becomes a
meaningful activity.
One more thought and I'll get off your screens...  We've steadfastly
resisted making lkml and friends subscriber-only mailing lists precisely
because we don't want to miss a potential bug report because a would-be
submitter isn't subscribed.  If people aren't looking for bug reports
here, what's the point?
