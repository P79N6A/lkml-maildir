The problem is that the it87 driver is used on a variety of motherboards,
some where the hardware monitoring device I/O ports are reserved by the
BIOS, some where they aren't. How am I supposed to deal with this?

PCI is an entirely different beast. With PCI you know the PCI device ID
that is associated with the resources, and for a given device, the
resources are always declared (if standard BARs are used) or never
declared; there's no "may be". So it's much easier to handle the
resources properly.

That's not really safe, no. They may overlap with other device resources
and prevent those drivers from loading.

As I wrote above, the problem is that you can't assume that. Some
motherboards do declare the range at PNP level but some don't. That's
the reason why the it87 driver (and most other hwmon drivers for
Super-I/O devices) do declare the I/O resource again.
Another problem is how do I connect this specific I/O port range of the
PNP0C02 device with the it87 driver? I am by far no PNP expert but it
looks to me like this PNP device covers more than one actual device, and
I/O port ranges do not have labels nor identifiers that would let me
find the one that corresponds to the IT87xxF device (if it exists at
all.)
I'm all for integrating the it87 driver into the PNP subsystem if it is
going to solve problems, but I just don't know how it works. I you do
some work in this direction, I'll be happy to help with reviews and
testing.

Well these resources already do cause problems, otherwise we wouldn't be
having this discussion ;)

OK.
