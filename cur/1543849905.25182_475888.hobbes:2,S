Exactly.  The only reserved sysctl numbers we have are 0 and -1.
Until my previous patch there was on number you could place into the
sysctl table that meant we did not have a binary sysctl name.  0 was
the closest but since it terminated the table it is generally useless.
-2 was a hack attempting to implement that within in the confines of
the previous sysctl implementation.
Now that I have reserved ctl_name == 0 to explicitly mean no sysctl number
and require both ctl_name == 0 and procname == NULL to terminate a sysctl
table.  We can remove the hack that nfs had, because we actually have a clean
way of implementing it.
There are sysctl tables currently in existence that use -2 as the index
of a data entry so that was out.  Numbers around MIN_INT/MAX_INT are probably
still available to reserve for a new purpose globally but 0 seems perfectly
up to the job.
I kept the CTL_UNNUMBERED name because it seems a little clearer than CTL_NONE.
