No, we are sending an event that says:
	block/hda/hda3 was mounted.
Now it's up to you, in your namespace to figure out where sysfs is
mounted, and then what, if any /dev device corrisponds to that sysfs
block device (using udevinfo in your namespace if you so desire.)
We aren't giving absolute /dev entries here, that's the beauty of the
kobject tree :)
