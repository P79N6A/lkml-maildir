While this looks like it will work fine for the z990, it is a special case 
which does not address other requirements for hardware support (some 
initial requirements are listed at 
http://www.intercode.com.au/jamesm/crypto/hardware_notes.txt
).
I'm not enthusiastic about adding infrastructure which is really just a
hack for some quaint hardware, and probably does not work towards
addressing more common hardware requirements.
