Augh... It's ugly, indeed, but... sysctl() is not much nicer and all
systems in question manage to deal with it somehow. OTOH doing it as
strings... Hell knows. I'll look at it. Considering that HFS folks
had already asked for more than one value here (creator and type?) it may
be reasonable. I'm afraid that doing that may open the hell gates ;-/
'N' in *ANA can be 'namespace' as well as 'number'...

BTW, how does NetBSD deal with HFS <cough> forks?
