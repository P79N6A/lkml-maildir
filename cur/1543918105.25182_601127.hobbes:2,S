Subject: [patch] menuconfig - lift the fs menu
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/2/172

Lift the FS menu a bit by moving filesystem-specific
parts into their own menu.
This also moves minix and romfs into the "misc fs" menu,
as per Randy Dunlap's suggestion [
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/25/344
]
