I checked again and there is something that looks broken to me. I agree with you
that the NMI watchdog must be per-CPU. In fact it is setup per local APIC in
smpboot.c. Yet what is confusing is that the owner variable lapic_nmi_owner
is shared with spinlock. So you either setup NMI on all CPUs or none. 
That also implies that the reserve_lapic_nmi() function must be called only
once. If called for each CPU, it will fail for the second caller because
it will see the lapic_nmi_owner already set to RESERVED. But if called only
once, then the the disable logic in reserve_lapic_nmi() is wrong:
int reserve_lapic_nmi(void)
{
        unsigned int old_owner;
        spin_lock(&lapic_nmi_owner_lock);
        old_owner = lapic_nmi_owner;
        lapic_nmi_owner |= LAPIC_NMI_RESERVED;
        spin_unlock(&lapic_nmi_owner_lock);
        if (old_owner & LAPIC_NMI_RESERVED)
                return -EBUSY;
        if (old_owner & LAPIC_NMI_WATCHDOG)
                disable_lapic_nmi_watchdog();
        return 0;
}
If reserve_lapic_nmi() is called only once, then it will call
disable_lapic_nmi_watchdog() on ONLY one CPU even though it was
setup on all CPUs in smpboot.c. The function disable_lapic_nmi_watchdog()
should be called on all CPUs (once nmi_active, nmi_watchdog are moved
out of it). 
It appears to me that the lapic_nmi_owner variable somehow needs
to become a per-cpu variable. Then the reserve_lapic_nmi() would
have to be called on CPUs as necessary.
