Subject: [GIT PULL] sh updates for 2.6.24-rc3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/9/26

The only thing of note here (depending on whether one has a sadistic
inclination towards page colouring or not) is basically some of the
kmap_coherent() interfacing which fixes up regressions observed on some
old parts with 2-way aliasing VIPT dcaches. The clear_user_highpage() and
copy_user_highpage() bits are more or less directly adapted from MIPS,
with the PG_dcache_dirty/PG_mapped logic for lazy dcache writeback
flipped. These particular regressions started showing up in 2.6.23 after
the initial interface was merged. The rest is just idle bug fixing and
killing off some dead code.
sh64 also had a total of 1 trivial changeset, so that got pulled in to
this update as well for general completeness.
