Well I'm running a Gigabyte GA-8STXCFS which is using the
SiS645DX/SiS962L chipset. I'll certainly give the patch a spin if anyone
can throw me a pointer.
I was under the impression that once  Linux took over from the BIOS it
had complete control of the system, including the interrupt/exception
table. I am assuming some sort of interrupt or exception must be being
generated by this keypress that runs some BIOS code. Is this is the case
is that not a "Bad Thing", ACPI/APM issues aside shouldn't the kernel
only run code *it wants to*.
