Hi,
I am using your v1.5 VIA driver and it seems to work well. Here is my
dmesg output:
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.31
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes
VP_IDE: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
VP_IDE: chipset revision 16
VP_IDE: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
VP_IDE: VIA vt82c686a IDE UDMA66 controller on pci0:7.1
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xd000-0xd007, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xd008-0xd00f, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd:pio
hda: QUANTUM FIREBALL EL5.1A, ATA DISK drive
ide0: Setting drive 0 to PIO4
hdc: CD-ROM TW 120D, ATAPI CDROM drive
ide1: Setting drive 0 to PIO3
hdc: set_drive_speed_status: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdc: set_drive_speed_status: error=0x04
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
ide0: Setting drive 0 to UDMA2
hda: 10018890 sectors (5130 MB) w/418KiB Cache, CHS=623/255/63, UDMA(33)
ide1: Setting drive 2 to MDMA1
hdc: ATAPI 12X CD-ROM drive, 240kB Cache, DMA
Uniform CD-ROM driver Revision: 3.11
Partition check:
 hda: hda1 hda2 < hda5 hda6 hda7 hda8 hda9 hda10 >
Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
FDC 0 is a post-1991 82077
This is on a Abit KA7 board. I only have one ide drive (udma33)which is
hda  and a ATAPI cdrom which is hdc.
BTW: This driver seems to have helped but not eliminated an ongoing
problem I have been having with 2.4 kernels and XFree 3.3.6. The desktop
freezes but the mouse still moves, I am still working on this one. :)
Would you please tell me when CONFIG_VIA82CXXX_TUNING should be set and
when it shouldn't be set? 
Thanks,
Shane
