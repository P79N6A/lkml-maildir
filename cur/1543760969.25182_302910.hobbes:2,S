The for (;;) form has always struck me as needlessly clever and I've
known it to puzzle coworkers. I try to make my for loops fall into the
mold of simple initialize/test/advance. But no, I'm not aware of any
LKML concensus opinion on this particular point.
The assignment-in-if problem is a bit more serious as it exacerbates
the jammed-up-against-the-right-margin formatting issues.
