You mean the typed pointer inside struct inode's union?  Because I
needed a way to go from struct inode to struct ext2_inode_info,
-without- a nasty cast.  inode->u.ext2_ip maintains the type information
without resorting to a nastier solution like an OFFSET_OF macro. 
Suggestions for improvement welcome.

Agreed.  That would be [not yet written] patch8 in my plan.

In my patch get_empty_inode and new_inode are completely identical. 
This is easy.

I don't have an opinion on this one way or the other...

Yes... the opacity factor in the other patch bothers me.

Not doing so now is a shoot-on-sight offense, I thought...
