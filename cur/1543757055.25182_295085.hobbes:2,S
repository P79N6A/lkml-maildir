As far as I understand it, there are only non-free licences for
Bitkeeper.  For one you pay with money, for the other with freedom.
While I am posting in this thread, I have a few questions to Larry
McVoy:
- You wrote that you could not develop Bitkeeper as free software,
because it is economically not viable.  You also write that you put
the non-compete clause in the pay-with-freedom license, because you
don't want to see a free clone of bitkeeper eat your business.  So do
you consider a free Bitkeeper-like system economically viable after
all?
- You say that all information is there, in the form of the patches.
Could Bitkeeper reconstruct the Linux tree(s) from the patches alone?
