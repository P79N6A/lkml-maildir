I have no problems accepting your patch. Thanks for it.
I just want to have to deal with a human manageable finite number of
actual driver versions :). I also want the same driver source to also be
useable on recent 2.2 kernels.
About timers in modules and more generally either timers in drivers or
modules unloading, you must keep in mind that this stuff has been racy for
years in Linux. Allow time for me to check if it is really fixed in latest
kernel and so to make sure it is worthwhile to apply your patch.
