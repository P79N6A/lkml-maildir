Hello,
I need support for files larger than 2GB.  What's the status for that ?  
AFAIK neither 2.2 nor 2.4-test support that out of the box.  Can anyone
point me to a good link for patches ?  Apart from the kernel, does
anything else need changes for large file support ?
 Thanks,
							Arnaud

The reason computer chips are so small is computers don't eat much.
