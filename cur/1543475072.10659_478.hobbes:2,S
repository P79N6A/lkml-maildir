I get the message "device or resource busy: /dev/dsp" even when no other 
process is using the device. This happens with both 2.1.132 and 
2.2.0pre4, but not with 2.0.36
It seems like when the device (/dev/dsp) has been opened once for one 
mode (read-only or write-only), trying to open it later with a different 
mode fails. In other words, it I first use the playback, the recording stops 
working and inversly.
