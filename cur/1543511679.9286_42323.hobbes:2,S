I don't know of any Unixes which are truly plug and play.
I have no experience with BeOS, but I've heard their solution works
well.
Microsoft doesn't use device nodes, but they solve the naming issue with
GUID, Globally Unique Identifiers. This is something that has been
brought up before.
Also, Windows doesn't differentiate between different Mice for instance,
they all move the one cursor on the screen.
All in all, I'm not really familiar with all of the different PnP
solutions in other OS'. Does anyone have more information?
