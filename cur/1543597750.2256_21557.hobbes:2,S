How is making a virus any different from making any other weapon, like
a gun?  Using it against someone might of course be illegal.
There are certainly valid reasons for making viruses.  For example
in order to test (and develop) antivirus software that 
automatically detect new viruses without being told about them first.
Oh, and surely someone can invent an excuse for using a virus
offensively
too.  "I need this to defend my site from cyber-terrorists..."
