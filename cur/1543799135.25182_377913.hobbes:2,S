There is an auto-eject function causing the media to be ejected on the last
user closing the device. Unfortunately it makes the device open itself
during mounts, and setting this flag will inevitably eject the media.
Additionally, it didn't work with my SCSI cdroms.
With slight changes, it could do the trick.
OTOH, we could also introduce the 'eject' mount option to let umount() eject
the media after the (last if possible) mount is gone. This will behave sane
for audio CDs, too.
