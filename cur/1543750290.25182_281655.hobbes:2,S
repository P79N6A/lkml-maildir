Subject: local root exploit confirmed in 2.6.10: Linux 2.6 Kernel Capability LSM Module Local Privilege Elevation

Frank Barknecht pointed this out on linux-audio-dev, it's a horrible
bug, I confirmed it in 2.6.10, and have not seen it mentioned on the
list.
Executive summary:
run "vim" as normal user.  Do ":r /etc/shadow".  Permission denied.
do "modprobe capability" as root in another terminal
Do ":r /etc/shadow" again in the same vim.  You will be able to read and
write /etc/shadow as normal user.
