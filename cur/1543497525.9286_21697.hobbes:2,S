Please ask Ingo Molnar to put a recent version on some accessible placce
(ftp or http-site).
I found some problems with FPU saving for multithreaded apps, which Ingo
fixed, but that happended after the 2.2.1 patch was sent to the list.
I can mail you the latest version, which I got: fx-2.2.5-A4 from 16th of
April 1999. It works perfectly here. Ingo certainly has more recent versions.
