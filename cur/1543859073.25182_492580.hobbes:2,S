That wasn't very interesting, because you also had the patch that just 
disabled "page_mkclean_one()" entirely:

The above patch is bad. It's always going to hide the bug, but it hides it 
by just not doing anything at all. So any patch combination that contains 
that patch will probably _always_ fix your problem, but it won't be an 
interesting patch..
So can you remove that small fragment? Also, it would be nice if you added 
the WARN_ON() to this sequence in mm/page-writeback.c:
+                       if (!must_clean_ptes && cleaned)
+                               set_page_dirty(page);
just make it do a WARN_ON() if this ever triggers.
Then, IF the corruption is gone, we'd love to see the WARN_ON results..
