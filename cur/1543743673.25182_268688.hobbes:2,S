I seem to get filesystem corruption whenever I mount a Fedora 
Core 2 (2.6.5 kernel) with a RedHat 9 rescue CD (2.4.20) or my
other 2.4.18 rescue media and try to chroot to the system image.
I've tried on a few systems so it's not a hardware issue.
Here are the messages I get in dmesg.  They seem file system 
related.
EXT3-fs: mounted filesystem with ordered data mode.
attempt to access beyond end of device
08:02: rw=0, want=1219858868, limit=15767797

I haven't been able to reliably reproduce the actual file 
system corruption that I've seen.  Sometimes ls doesn't work
in /bin/ or once I lost everything under /usr.
I've googled for this and I found a redhat bug that might be
related.

I have tried with both ext2 and ext3 partitions formatted 
under the 2.6 kernel and I get the same results in both cases.
Has something changed in ext2 and ext3 to make them not 
backward compatible to 2.4 kernels?
regards,
dan carpenter
