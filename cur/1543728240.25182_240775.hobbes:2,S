No. It's just that the changes are so fundamental (how data is stored,
how we prepare the image etc) that to talk about evolution is simply a
misnomer. It's a redesign. The steps did occur one at a time, and there
are basic similarities, but some of the steps were fundamental rewrites.

I agree with the last bit, and I don't want a second competing design.
But there are flag days for some things, and multiple versions of some
code are found in the kernel (suspend until recently, e100/eepro100
driver...). This should be one of them.
Once it is merged, the period of co-existence should be short anyway.
Suspend 2 has had a ton of testing and is - dare I say it - virtually
bugfree. There should be no reason to delay its including in Linus'
tree.

I'm not suggested it should be or that suspend2 was (it has been nearly
two years since I posted my first patch). But I am suggesting that the
process of working out bugs and thinking through design improvements has
already been done and tested. I'm perfectly willing to submit 16 or 30
patches, breaking up the changes into their main parts, but it is a
waste of your time and mine for me to break it up further than that.
That said, I'm sure there will also be suggestions that I can do some
things better. I look forward to them. But I don't look forward to
trying to break some of the irreducible changes down into artificially
distinguished component parts.
