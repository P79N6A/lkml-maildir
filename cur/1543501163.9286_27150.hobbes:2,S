I had a few mount points on systems that use Solaris
and the wsize and rsize is 32k. I assume that Solaris
uses 32k for a better performance.

I use SuSE 6.1 as the distribution. The kernel is
2.2.10ac3 and the NFSv3 patch is 
linux-2.2.10-ac2-nfsv3-0.9.9.1.dif. I have no other
patches installed. I could not gather additional
informations from the logs. I will change to 2.2.10ac5
with NFSv3 9.9.10 tonight.
