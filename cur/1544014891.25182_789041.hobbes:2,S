Subject: [PATCH] trace: mmiotrace to the tracer menu in Kconfig
Impact: cosmetic change in Kconfig menu layout
This patch was originally suggested by Peter Zijlstra, but seems it
was forgotten.
CONFIG_MMIOTRACE and CONFIG_MMIOTRACE_TEST were selectable
directly under the Kernel hacking / debugging menu in the kernel
configuration system. They were present only for x86 and x86_64.
Other tracers that use the ftrace tracing framework are in their own
sub-menu. This patch moves the mmiotrace configuration options there.
Since the Kconfig file, where the tracer menu is, is not architecture
specific, HAVE_MMIOTRACE_SUPPORT is introduced and provided only by
x86/x86_64. CONFIG_MMIOTRACE now depends on it.
