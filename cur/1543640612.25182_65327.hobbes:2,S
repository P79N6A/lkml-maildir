Here's that lets you fit 3 1" drives in a full height space and a good deal
cheaper at about $40:
http://www.pcpowercooling.com/products/cooling/drive/bay-cool/index_bc3.htm
Pros: Local company (In Carlsbad right off the 5 across the street from
Claim Jumper, In And Out, etc) so fast shipping if you can't make the drive
there to pick it up.  Fans to keep the drives cool.  Filtered fan inlet with
common sized 80mm fan.
Cons: Don't see any...
