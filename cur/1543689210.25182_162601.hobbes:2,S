I think it was the bit when you suggested using bitkeeper to sync multiple
/etc/passwd files when I really switched off ... perhaps you were just
joking ;-) Perhaps we just had a massive communication disconnect.

I can go back and re-read them, if I misread them last time than I apologise.
I've also shifted perspectives on SSI clusters somewhat over the last year. 
Yes, if it's SSI, I'd agree for the most part ... once it's implemented ;-)
I'd rather start with everything separate (one OS instance per node), and
bind things back together, than split everything up. However, I'm really
not sure how feasible it is until we actually have something that works.
I have a rough plan of how to go about it mapped out, in small steps that
might be useful by themselves. It's a lot of fairly complex hard work ;-)

Let's not go into that one again, we've both dragged that over the coals
already. Time to agree to disagree. All the significant degredations I
looked at that people screamed were scalability changes turned out to
be something else completely.

I'm cool with doing SSI clusters over NUMA on a per-node basis. But it's
still vapourware ... yes, I'd love to work on that full time to try and
change that if I can get funding to do so.
