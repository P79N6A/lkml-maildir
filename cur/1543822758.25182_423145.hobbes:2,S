The thing is, that it boots nicely into init=/bin/sh, and even runs top and 
mc w/o a hitch, but when another bash is started the kernel starts to oom 
everything, when in fact it should have easily been able to swap.
Note that this is not specific to mem=8M, but rather a general oom 
observation even for mem=4G, where it is only much later to occur.
Thanks!
