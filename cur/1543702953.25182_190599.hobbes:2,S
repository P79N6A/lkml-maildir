I think BARs 1-5 don't exist at all. Being set to all ones is common for
"unused" (it ends up being a normal result of a lazy probe - you set all 
bits to 1 to check for the size of the region, and if you decide not to 
map it and leave it there, you'll get the above behaviour).
I suspect only BAR0 is actually real.
What's in that ffe80000-ffffffff region that the BIOS has allocated,
anyway?
