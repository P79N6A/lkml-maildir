I'm still hoping that distros (like my employer) and orgs like OSDL will 
step up, and hook 2.6.x BK snapshots into daily test harnesses.
Something like John Cherry's reports to lkml on warnings and errors 
would be darned useful.  His reports are IMO an ideal model:  show 
day-to-day _changes_ in test results.  Don't just dump a huge list of 
testsuite results, results which are often clogged with expected 
failures and testsuite bug noise.
