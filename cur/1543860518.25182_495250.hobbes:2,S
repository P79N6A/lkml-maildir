A double free of non-NULL is certainly an error.
So the idea of setting it to NULL is ok, since then you can
kfree the variable over and over again without any harm.
It is just complicated to do this side effect free.
Maybe one should check for builtin-constant and take the address,
if this is not an builtin-constant.
sth, like this
#define kfree_nullify(x) do { \
	if (__builtin_constant_p(x)) { \
		kfree(x); \
	} else { \
		typeof(x) *__addr_x = &x; \
		kfree(*__addr_x); \
		*__addr_x = NULL; \
	} \
} while (0)
