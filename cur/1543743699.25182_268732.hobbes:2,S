Added:
  +buildfix.diff
This was accidentally removed from ck2 so it has been readded. Prevents 
"internal compiler error" with certain versions of gcc.
  +s9.0_s9.1.diff
An update to the staircase cpu scheduler for a long standing bug I 
recently discovered whereby tasks could drop to low priority for long 
periods and have sustained periods of high latency and low cpu usage.

A fix for the trigger happy out-of-memory killer that seemed to go mad 
in 2.6.9
