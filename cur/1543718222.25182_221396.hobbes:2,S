Subject: [RFC] sysfs kobject that doesn't trigger hotplug events
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I'm adding some data structures to a device and want them to appear 
under that device in sysfs in subdirectories.  These data structures are 
linked together in a tree like layout so it would make sense to have 
them have a subdirectory tree representing them.  These data structures 
have a kobject for reference counting and I can use kobject_add and 
kobject_del to add them to the sysfs tree.
Looking through the kobject.c code I noticed that this would create a 
lot of hotplug events which would burn up a bit of processor time.  
These events are not necessary as these are not device kobjects.  I've 
enclosed a patch to my solution for this.  I'd like to know if there are 
any side effects with this method.
