Hello Oleg,
I've done some more tests and quite frankly I think this is really related 
to the dreaded ''fglrx.ko'' module. It seems to me that it is much easier 
to reproduce the problem if that damn module is loaded. It does uses 
workqueue. Then there is another driver ipw3945 loaded and it is required 
to run binary only ''ipw3945d'' daemon just to start using wireless driver 
...
In either way both these kernel modules are workqueue users.
Btw, I had also tested kernel (compiled from the same source) but on 
different laptop (EVO N800v), single core, Pentium M 2GHz. Kernel is not 
freezing on shutdown, even loop nfs kernel stop/start - does not cause any 
kernel panic as on nx9420 (Dual Core) laptop. And that with or without any 
patch applied from Oleg. :((
I think this time it is really needed to stop here, kernel was tainted for 
a reason. :(((
Thank you both, Oleg and Andrew.
