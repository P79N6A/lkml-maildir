   You think as system-programmer.
   Every bit of i$ waste - hit user space applications too.
   128k of $ - is for every app.
   If you gained one cycle by polluting one more cache line - do not 
forget that this cache line probably contained some info, which was able 
to avoid cache miss for another application. So you gained cycle here - 
and lost it immediately in another app. Not good.
   If you can improve performance by NOT polluting cache - it would be 
another story :-)))

   Indeed. RTFM quickly shown some good examples.
   But still I never saw this kind of thing being used in kernel. 
Instead of writing normal asm we have something like i386/mmx.c. And 
i386/checksum.S not the best sample of asm in kernel too. Sad.

    There should be some SCO's source code in Linux -
       my servers sometimes are crashing.      -- People
