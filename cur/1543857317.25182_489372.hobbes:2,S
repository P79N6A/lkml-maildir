If memory consumption is less than "oomthresh", that process is simply 
bypassed.  (Equivalent to oomkilladj==OOM_DISABLE.)  Otherwise, continue 
processing as normal.

Correct.

Currently it does not.  This is to allow for different memory access 
patterns by parent/child.  And exec() wipes it as well.

Hmm...it might make sense given that the point of the group is to manage 
tasks together...but it would make accounting more tricky.  Currently 
it's just a very simple comparison of p->mm->total_vm against the 
threshold in badness().

Then the system wasn't properly engineered.  <grin>
In this case you reboot.
