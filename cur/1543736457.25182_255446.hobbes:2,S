is this reproducible? can you get sysrq-t / sysrq-p while it is slow
writing to disk?
I have seen this, too but i cannot nail it down to some specific
pattern, it just "sometimes" is slow. Sysrq-p shows me it's almost
always in "pccardd" (where it shouldn't be during suspend, iiuc).
Unfortunately Pavel does not see this so we have to convince him that
this is really a problem ;-)
So if you can reproduce this, it would be a step in the right direction.
