Hi,
I have opserved that the current linux 2.6test8 totally fails to 
correctly set the IO-APIC IRQs.
Even in just PIC mode, it cannot change any IRQs. It just has to stay 
with whatever the bios set.
Can anyone give me a URL for the VT8235/VT400 chipsets datasheet 
specification, so that I could implement correct IO-APIC setting for 
Motherboards based on this.
Cheers
James
