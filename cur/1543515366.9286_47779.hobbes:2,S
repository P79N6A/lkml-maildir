Hello,
I have a Rage Fury (AGP) and an Xpert@Play (PCI) in my computer.
for the first time, I managed compiling aty128fb on my 686, but I don't know
how to use it...
First of all, I don't know if it is possible to have two fb?
With lilo, every attempt I do ends with the detection of Rage Pro and hangs the
boot process... but turn on my second monitor that is plugged on the PCI card.
What option should I give at boot?
Thanks you very much,
Please, don't cc to me: I am on the list...
