Andrew, Linus,
This is mostly a resend, modulo problems discovered by Mike Waychison
and Brice Goglin in the previous submission.  Thanks for the review!
Please apply!
If you still have any gripes about FUSE, I'd very much like to know
about it (it stinks of microkernels, it's too complex, etc.), so I can
try to address them.
Thanks,
Miklos
