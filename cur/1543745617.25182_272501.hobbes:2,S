Note, that NTFS supports all those things natively on the file system,
so it may be worth keeping in mind when designing your APIs.  It would
be nice if one day when ntfs write support is finished, when running
Samba on an NTFS partition on Linux, Samba can directly access all those
things directly from NTFS.  I guess a good way would be if your
interface is sufficiently abstracted so that it can use xattrs as a
backend or a native backend which NTFS could provide for you or Samba
could provide for NTFS.  For example NTFS stores the 4 different times
in NT format in each inode (base Mft record) so you would not have to
take an xattr performance hit there.
Anyway, just thought I would mention this, I am not expecting you to do
anything about it, especially since full NTFS read-write support is
still a long way away...
Best regards,
