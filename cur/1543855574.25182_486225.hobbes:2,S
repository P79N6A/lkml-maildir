That sure reads to me like you were saying that it would be a security 
hole, so that can't be how it works.   Maybe I just misinterpreted, but 
at any rate it is a non sequitur, so let's move on.

I still don't see how feeding tons of zeros ( or some other carefully 
crafted sequence ) in will not decrease the entropy of the pool ( even 
if it does so in a way that is impossible to predict ), but assuming it 
can't, what good does a non root user do by writing to random?  If it 
does not increase the entropy estimate, and it may not actually increase 
the entropy, why bother allowing it?

I would favor the latter argument since the entropy estimate is only 
that: an estimate.  Trying to come up with an estimate of the amount of 
entropy that will be added to the existing unknown pool after it is 
stirred by the new data seems to be an exercise in futility.
