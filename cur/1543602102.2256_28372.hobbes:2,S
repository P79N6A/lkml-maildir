BTW, just for the statistics: On the Duron 600 machine, for which
I reported the athlon bug, the fix does not work. Register 0x55 has
a default value of 0x81, but setting it to 0x01 (as the fix does)
doesn't solve the problem, athlon optimised 2.4.9 kernels still fail
to run. 
But, OTOH, the computer in question regulary oopses on 2.4.0-test7 which
didn't have the athlon optimises page copy routine at all, so it may be
just a case of faulty hardware :-(
