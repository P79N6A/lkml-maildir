Because timeout has it's meaning for syscall processing, but signals are
completely separated objects. Why do you want to allow to queue signals
_and_ add 'temporal' signal mask for syscall? Just use one way - queue
them all.

That's where we have different opinioins (among others places :) - I do
not agree that signals are parameters for syscall, I insist that is is
usual events. ppoll() shows us that there is no difference between
signal reported as usual user - syscall returns and we can check if
something was changed (signal was delivered or even was fired), it does
not differ from the case when syscall returns and we check what event it
reports first - ready signal or some other event.

They are usefull for special waiting, but not for waiting when syscall
is called. The former is supported by timer notifications, the latter -
by syscall parameter. We can add support for absolute timer
notifications as addon to relative ones. But using there timeval
structure is not accessible, since it has different sizes on different
arches, so there will be problems with 32/64 arches like x86_64.
Instead it is possible to use u32/u32 structure for sec/nsec, like what
is used for relative timeouts.

It does not introduce any flexibility, since syscall does not have a
parameter to specify absolute or relative timeout has been provided.
That's one.
I do argue that syscall must have timout parameter, since it is related
to syscall behaviour but not to events syscall is working with - which is
completely different things: syscall must be interrupted after some time
to allow to fail operation or perform other tasks, but timer event can
be fired in any time in the future, syscall should not care about
underlaying events. That's two.
You say "every other syscall other than poll" - but even aio_suspend()
and friends use relative timeouts (although glibc converts them into 
absolute to be used with pthread_cond_timedwait), so why do you propose 
to use wariable sized structure (even if it is transferred almost for 
free in syscall) instead of usual timeout specified in 
seconds/nanoseconds/anything? That's three.
