Yes.

2.4.9 behaved like current 2.6 --- on MS_ASYNC, it did a
set_page_dirty() which means the page will get picked up by the next
5-second bdflush pass.  But later 2.4 kernels were changed so that they
started MS_ASYNC IO immediately with filemap_fdatasync() (which is
asynchronous regarding the new IO, but which blocks synchronously if
there is already old IO in flight on the page.)
That was reverted back to the earlier, 2.4.9 behaviour in the 2.5
series.
Cheers,
 Stephen
