Since this is really a question in several areas I'll put it here. Now 
that the Pentium-D processors are available at reasonable prices and for 
quick delivery, can anyone speak to the ACPI issues? The available 
boards use the 945 and 955 chipset. Is there any reason to think that 
the scheduler would get confused by the CPU, such as thinking it was HT 
or some such?
The specs indicate that 64 bit is supported, is there any actualy Linux 
support for the Intel 64 bit stuff in gcc and the kernel? One of the 
people I work with reports that the distro he runs on his Athlon64 lock 
solid after reading the boot sector, so obviously this isn't Athlon 
compatable.
The price is lower than a dual Xeon setup if you have an application 
which needs SMP, and initial power values make it look like a lower 
power solution overall.
