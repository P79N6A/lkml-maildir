Well nobody asked, but here goes. My system has roughly 1,012 devices.
Their names occupy 6,160 bytes.
So, you either keep all this stuff together in a /dev directory, or
you have a program that builds potentially the same number of device
entries upon startup. It resides on the file-system, and it still has
to have the names within it (although some can be constructed, given
sufficient code).  It looks like 6 of one, 1/2 dozen of another to
me.
Or is it that somebody still wants the awful....
			/dev/dsk/c0t3d0s0
			/dev/dsk/c0t3d0s6	
			/dev/dsk/c0t3d0s7
     ... that Sun uses??
A simple shell-script will generate these for you. After all, these
horrible names are simply a 'human readable' association with
major and minor device numbers. You can name them anything. They
don't even have to be in the /dev directory.
