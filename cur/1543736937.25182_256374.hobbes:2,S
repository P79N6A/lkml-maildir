How does the computer "know" that the timer is at the beginning
of the jiffy?  By definition, Linux (without HRT support) has
no way of dealing with sub-jiffy resolution for timers.
Maybe a graphic (ascii-graphic) will help:
tick 1 ---------------------
tick 2 ---------------------
schedule point A ->
schedule point B ->
tick 3 ---------------------
tick 4 ---------------------
tick 5 ---------------------
Let's say, that at point A, you ask for a 20 millisecond timer.
(2 jiffies, on ARM).  You think you are asking for a timer to fire
on tick 4 (20 milliseconds after tick 2), but Linux can't
distinguish point A from point B.  In order to avoid
the situation where someone scheduled a 20 millisecond timer
at point B, and had it fire on tick 4 (only 10 milliseconds
later), Linux adds one jiffy to the expiration time.
Both timers (set at point A or point B) would fire
on tick 5.  For the A timer, this makes it 30 milliseconds
(or, jiffies plus one) later, which looks pretty bad.
For the B timer, the interval would be close to 20
milliseconds, which looks pretty good.
If you are rescheduling one-shot timers immediately
after they fire, you should 'undershoot' on the time
interval, to hit the tick boundary you want, based
on the jiffy resolution of your platform.
