 The poll() library call was introduced in libc 5.4.28
 (and provides emulation using select if your kernel does not
 have a poll syscall).
+.SH NOTES
+When
+.B poll
+indicates that a file descriptor is ready, this is only a strong hint,
+not a guarantee, that a read or write is possible without blocking.
+For this reason, the associated file descriptors
+.I must always be in non-blocking mode
+(see
+.BR fcntl (2))
+in a correct program.  Reasons why the I/O could block include:
+.TP
+(i)
+Another process may have performed I/O on the
+.I fd
+in the meantime.
+.TP
+(ii)
+Some needed kernel buffer space may have been consumed for reasons
+totally unrelated to this I/O, or
+.TP
+(iii)
+Since 2.4.x, Linux has overlapped UDP checksum verification with
+copying to user-space.  If a UDP packet arrives,
+.B poll
+will indicate that data is ready, but during the read, if the checksum is
+bad, the packet will disappear and (if no subsequent packet with a
+valid checksum is waiting) the read will indicate that no data is available.
+.PP
+In general, it is legal for
+.B poll
+to make some optimistic assumptions, subject to later verification by the
+subsequent I/O, as long as this does not result in a busy-loop where
+.B poll
+is stuck thinking data is ready when it is not.
