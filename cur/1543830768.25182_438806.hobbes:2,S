Jay - what happens if we have 1024 CPUs (the current default config
for ia64/sn2)?
My naive expectation would be that the rate of exits/sec would go up as
the number of CPUs. In other words, I'd expect the exits/sec/CPU to be
a rough constant, slowly increasing over the years as the CPU clock
rate goes up.
So if current CPU technology can generate 1000 exits/sec, and if we
have 1024 CPUs then doesn't that mean we'd like to handle a million
exits/sec?
