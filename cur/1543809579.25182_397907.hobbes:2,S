I still like the following:
clone(): extended with flags for asking a private copy of various
	namespaces.  For the CLONE_NEWPIDSPACE flag, the pid which
	is returned to the parent process is it's handle to the
	new pidspace.
sys_execpid(pid, argv, envp): exec a new syscall with the requested
	pid, if the pid is available.  Else either return an error,
	or pick a random pid.  Error makes sense to me, but that's
	probably debatable.
sys_fork_slide(pid): fork and slide into the pidspace belong to pid.
	This way we can do things like
	p = sys_fork_slide(2794);
	if (p == 0) {
		kill(2974);
	} else {
		waitpid(p, 0, 0);
	}
Ok, this last one in particular needs to be improved, but these two
syscalls and the clone flags together give us all we need.  Right?
