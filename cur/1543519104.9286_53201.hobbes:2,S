You just noticed this trend ??? ALL 2.1.x and 2.2.x kernel will not compile
with all modules turned "on" (Alan's versions are better but still can not
be compiled "out of box").

Just like all 2.1.x and 2.2.x kernels for last few years... Nothing really new.

Ramdisk is broken in 2.3.31. There are exist patches to make it work
(as patch I'm using called bde-ramdisk-2.3.29-p1.patch and still applies I
guess it was broken for some time now)...

KSI was able to compile this beast :-) You can grab his .src.rpm from
http://www.ksi-linux.com/~khim/kernel/SRPMS
 -- even if it's for KSI-Linux
I guess it'll help you to compile it under different versions of Linux...

It was long long ago. And it should be for stable kernels anyway: development
is development. Some things will be always broken...

What do you mean ??? All patches for RedHat's kernel you can find in .src.rpm.
Ditto for all other vendors. You are free to grab that patches and apply them.

Hmm. Half of rpm's from latest version of Mandrake can not be rebuilt under
that version of Mandrake. Now what ?

It's not special versions of kernel. It's just versions where big hammer
was used to make some compileable :-/ SGI version of kernel can be called
special though...

Hey ! All their "secrets" are there ! Right on ftp ! How it can be called
"secret" if it's downloadable by everyone ?

Real version of kernel is still downloadable from ftp.kernel.org and
mirrors. It just can not be compiled :-)
