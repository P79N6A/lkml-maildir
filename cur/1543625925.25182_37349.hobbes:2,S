    ... Also we sort of have a problem since OPEN_MAX is not
    a constant on Linux x86. I guess that means a libc enforced
    behaviour or something for that bit
OPEN_MAX is described in the <limits.h> POSIX man page
as a runtime invariant constant. However, it is allowed
to be indeterminate, so no problems arise, I think.
