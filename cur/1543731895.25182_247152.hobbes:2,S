Subject: [patch 1/2] Set-cflags-before-including-arch-Makefile
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/8/30/214

Please note that this patch, even if UML-related, should be immediately
discussed for merging in mainline, if possible. The UML patch to handle
this has therefore been separated.
---Patch purpose:
If arch/$(ARCH)/Makefile is included before adding -O2 (and the rest) to
CFLAGS, I must duplicate the addition of it to USER_CFLAGS for UML.
So let's fix this.
