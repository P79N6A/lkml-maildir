Good point, sigh , I will look into reserfs but my adventurous nature is
getting a good beat down lately.

A CLUE!
Cool I will dig into this weekend. 
Thanks a lot

True 18 gigs is small and yes I don't have those two options
turned on , but my problem is this crash occures while Writing
to the drive not reading. So, Out of an estimated 24 crashes every
last one of them have caused me to enter single user mode manually
run e2fsck on the partition and hold down th y key for a few
minutes. Then after booting I have to go and clean out the directory
which (1-3) times results in another crash. Rexecute loop.
What I was thinking about is if I could remove the buffer layer
then I would have a lot less damage on the disk and maybe it could
just reboot on it's own. sigh
