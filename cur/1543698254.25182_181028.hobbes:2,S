 I'm compiling for SMP x86 and getting:
	make[3]: Entering directory `/homes/hawkwind/u0/cks/sys/linux-BK/drivers/char'
	gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/homes/hawkwind/u0/cks/sys/linux-BK/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i686   -nostdinc -iwithprefix include -DKBUILD_BASENAME=rtc  -c -o rtc.o rtc.c
	rtc.c: In function `rtc_init':
	rtc.c:772: `RTC_IOMAPPED' undeclared (first use in this function)
	rtc.c:772: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
	rtc.c:772: for each function it appears in.)
	rtc.c:773: `RTC_IO_EXTENT' undeclared (first use in this function)
	rtc.c: In function `rtc_exit':

	rtc.c:874: `RTC_IO_EXTENT' undeclared (first use in this function)
	make[3]: *** [rtc.o] Error 1
It looks like the MIPS changes require these to be defined in
include/asm-*/mc146818rtc.h (or included files) for all architectures
(previously RTC_IO_EXTENT was defined in rtc.c and RTC_IOMAPPED didn't
exist), but only MIPS has been updated to do this. From looking at the
diffs to rtc.c, it looks like the correct additions are just:
	#define RTC_IO_EXTENT	0x10	/* Only really two ports, but...	*/
	#define	RTC_IOMAPPED	0
	- cks
