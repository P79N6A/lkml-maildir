I have some other CodingStyle changes to submit, but feel free
to write this one up.
However, I didn't know that we had a known style for this, other
than "not indented so far that it's hidden".
If a label in column 0 [0-based :] confuses patch, then that's
a reason, I suppose.  I wasn't aware of that one...
In a case like that, we usually say "fix the tool then."
