Umm, when did I ever say "emulate smack on top of the reference  
policy"?  I state categorically that I can write an estimated 500  
line perl script which will generate a standalone SELinux policy  
based directly on a smack ruleset.  It would require no additional  
policy beyond what the script outputs, and the script would be only  
roughly 500 lines so it can't contain all that much direct source-to- 
output text.
I've started tinkering with that perl script, though I probably won't  
get it finished till tomorrow or sunday.

There is no "requirement" for a 400,000-line reference policy to  
reproduce exactly the behavior of SMACK.  The SMACK architecture is  
trivial and therefore the SELinux policy is also simple.

I can also state categorically that given the set of all admins,  
users, and software developers, hardly a fraction of them are  
qualified to write security policy at all.  Hell, most admins and  
software developers can't get SUID binaries right, and that's a  
thousand times simpler than a MAC security policy.  Ergo the only  
people who should be writing security policy for deployment are those  
people who have studied and trained in the stuff.  Those people are  
also known as "security professionals".

Neither security nor your average distro nowadays is "simple" by any  
stretch of the imagination.  Hell, my desktop system hits at least 2  
million unique lines of code during boot, let alone logging in to  
XFCE.  If you can show me a security system other than SELinux which  
is sufficiently flexible to secure those 2 million lines of code  
along with the other 50 million lines of code found in various pieces  
of software on my Debian box then I'll go put on my dunce hat and sit  
in the corner.
