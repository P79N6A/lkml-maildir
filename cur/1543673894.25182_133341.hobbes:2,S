Subject: [PATCH] 2.5->2.4 backport: PCMCIA crashes without CONFIG_ISA

Hello!
My patch to fix a crash in validate_mem() (drivers/pcmcia/rsrc_mgr.c)
without CONFIG_ISA defined
(
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-pcmcia/2003-April/000039.html
)
has been in the 2.5 kernels for some time, and it turns out that it needs
to be applied to 2.4.x kernels as well.
The patch against 2.4.21-rc2-ac2 is attached.
validate_mem() traverses memory regions and calls do_mem_probe() on them.
do_mem_probe() can free the current region.  That's why the pointer to the
next region should be preserved before do_mem_probe() is called.
There are two versions of validate_mem().  The one used when CONFIG_ISA is
defined does the right thing.  However, this fix has not been propagated
to the simplified version of validate_mem(), which is used without
CONFIG_ISA defined.
The backport has been published in the PCMCIA mailing list:
