It supports my idea that linux kernel driver miss some 'special'
initialization for Seagate disk. But I need to try HighPoint's own
driver first, hopefully during weekend.
I also know that's not problem of AUTO DMA, I tried it and it didn't
change anything. During boot driver reports that my disk can do only
PIO.
However I am myself not so sure if I should use the HPT366 or the PIIX4

The problem with faster controller is a bit funny. I suppose that the
HPT366 controller is there because of its ability to run UDMA66, so that
it should be faster.
Anyway, thanks for your comments.
