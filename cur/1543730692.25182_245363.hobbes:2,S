That doesn't make sense anyway. (actually, I tried what happens and the
result was an Oops ;))
It should be completely forbidden to link into a meta-directory or out
of such a directory. You could think of those meta-directory as a sysfs
for that inode. Of course it's not an own filesystem and that means that
there need to be a lot of security precautions in the VFS layer. Where
something like that belongs anyway, if done correctly.

What do you mean? If you tell that file that you want it to be
compressed or encrypted or modify some attributes (like ACLs) this isn't
necessarily a backdoor.

Yes, I don't think it was a good idea either. Probably someone should
remove these features and make it a "normal" filesystem. The people who
need it now can turn it on again and a real solution could be worked out
in Linux 2.7.
I wouldn't use it on a public server anyway now because I'm not
convinced some malicious guy could find a way to exploit that. What if
you changed into a meta directory using ftp and some manage to break
things? This might be very dangerous.
I personally think that the idea of doing something like this (I'm not
speaking of the current implementation which I think is really bad) is
the right way to go in the long term.
