The balancing of allocations between zones is becoming unnecessary. Also 
in a NUMA system we then have zone == node which allows for a series of 
simplifications.

There are 6 platforms that have only one zone. These are not major 
platforms. In order for major platforms to go to a single zone in general 
we would have to implement a generic mechanism to do an allocation where 
one can specify the memory boundaries. Many DMA engines have different
limitations from what ZONE_DMA and ZONE_DMA32 can provide. If such a 
scheme would be implemented then those would be able to utilize memory 
better and the amount of bounce buffers would be reduced.
