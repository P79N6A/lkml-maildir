Subject: [PATCH 1/2] workqueues: shrink cpu_populated_map when CPU dies
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/16/162

When cpu_populated_map was introduced, it was supposed that cwq->thread can
survive after CPU_DEAD, that is why we never shrink cpu_populated_map.
This is not very nice, we can safely remove the already dead CPU from the map.
The only required change is that destroy_workqueue() must hold the hotplug lock
until it destroys all cwq->thread's, to protect the cpu_populated_map. We could
make the local copy of cpu mask and drop the lock, but sizeof(cpumask_t) may be
very large.
Also, fix the comment near queue_work(). Unless _cpu_down() happens we do
guarantee the cpu-affinity of the work_struct, and we have users which rely on
this.
