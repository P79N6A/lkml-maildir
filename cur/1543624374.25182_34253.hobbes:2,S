you shouldn't even need a crossover cable :)  1000baseT NICs should figure
out what the wire pairings are and adjust the DSP accordingly.  at least
the acenic-based cards seem to work host-to-host with a regular patch
cable or a cross-over (or a hacked up pairing i tried which crossed over
both the two 100baseT pairs and the other 2 pairs which aren't usually
crossed over).
