Right, but if the timestamp granularity is coarse and there's no 
blocking call in between it makes no sense to invoke 
gettimeofday()/time() repeatedly. I was referring to the kind of app 
that abuses them just because somebody is too lazy to reuse the previous 
value - calling gettimeofday() in 10 sequential printf() statements for eg.
There are legitimate scenarios of course, but this doesn't seem to be 
one of them:
15:22:38.825562 kill(2419, SIGRTMIN)    = 0
15:22:38.825748 gettimeofday({1122405758, 825765}, NULL) = 0
15:22:38.825801 gettimeofday({1122405758, 825812}, NULL) = 0
15:22:38.825845 gettimeofday({1122405758, 825856}, NULL) = 0
15:22:38.825888 gettimeofday({1122405758, 825899}, NULL) = 0
15:22:38.825931 time(NULL)              = 1122405758
15:22:38.825968 gettimeofday({1122405758, 825984}, NULL) = 0
15:22:38.826012 gettimeofday({1122405758, 826022}, NULL) = 0
15:22:38.826062 time(NULL)              = 1122405758
15:22:38.826099 time(NULL)              = 1122405758
15:22:38.826142 time(NULL)              = 1122405758
...
Here's another cute one, just in case you thought calling getpid() once 
should be enough ;)

My point: "real world" apps do stupid things.
