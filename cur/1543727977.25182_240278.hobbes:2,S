Subject: Mozilla hang with 2.6.8-rc3-mm1

Running this kernel, preempt enabled, SMP enabled to get it to compile, I 
get Mozilla hangs, seemingly caused by a zombie process. I say that 
cautiously, the zombie is not seen when the hang is not present, the hang 
always has the zombie, they may have common cause.
ps output attached, config is on another machine not currently mountable. 
At this point just a heads up, I don't have enough info to debug. This is 
Mozilla 7.1, I'm going to upgrade to 7.1.2 because of security issues, 
I'll repost with config if the problem comes back, the NFS server machine 
will be up by noon tomorrow.
