That's a given.  We might need kernel compile options to define how many
major numbers are used (and therefore how large the pool is).
Regardless of the translation between USB devices and /dev devices, we
still need some way to present these things in /dev -- perhaps
/dev/usb[0-255] is simply a particular interface on a particular device?
The main thrust of the idea still stands.
