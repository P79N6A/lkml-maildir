Uh... and aside from init, mission critical stuff... crond should never
get killed, it runs mission critical cleanup tasks..
If crond dies, might as well make the machine die in a lot of cases.. I
hate to miss my nightly database exports...
Getting to look more and more like we need some way to configure certain
tasks at the admin level to never die..
