I am with you this far.

Nothing is exported except to the reader's brain aka user space. It
is not exported to a new book.
Exporting a new interface is equivalent to making the marginal notes.
You can still READ the book without GPLing your brain or your
application. You can make additional temporary marginal notes,
place data into the kernel which causes the kernel to disgorge
some data.

Either you cannot have a non-GPL program on the kernel OR you can. It
makes no difference if the kernel is modified (the modification is GPL)
or the kernel is not modified. The modified kernel must be distributed
as source if requested. The application does not unless EVERY application
must be distributed with source.
There is apparently no argument with regards to applications that are
not GPL running on LINUX. Therefore there should be no argument with
an application that uses a newly exported API being GPLed.
If you are considering the potential case that the modification is made
to the kernel and then the source for that modification is also used in
user space in an application requiring the application to be GPLed then
you must first prove it was done in that order rather than the other order.
Code can also be released dual licensed. GPL for the kernel and private
for the user space, if it is done so by the owner or creator of the code
in question. Anything else is absurd on its face.
