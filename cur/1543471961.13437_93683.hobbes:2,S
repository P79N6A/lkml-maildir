Greetings,
	My most useful system (P-II, Adaptec 100% SCSI, Matrox) system will not
boot.  Last time I reported [a problem similar to] this I got several
messages from people who were attempting to make me realize how
in-DUH-vidual I truly am.  
	I make the kernel (I have tried: gcc 2.7.2.3, 2.8.1, and egcs 1.0.2)
and it compiles, I move the files, 'lilo -v', sync the disks, and
reboot.   When the system starts, I try to use the new kernel, and it
just says:
LILO: 
Loading
And nothing more.  If this is a LILO problem, then why will my current
running kernel (2.1.129) boot? Basted [?Bastard?] Turkey kicks my butt.  
	So, I humbly submit it to the Linux people of low & high, and I ask:
'What do you suggest?'
Thanks,
  Joshua
