What remains to be answered is, how does one split a system of a myriad of
build rule files into a reasonable amount of small patches.
Of course, you could have hundreds of patches each consisting of a single
Makefile.in, but how would that make the reviewing/integrating easier? In
the end you'd end up reading the same input, only you'd complement it by
frequently pressing your favorite show-me-the-next-mail key.
The solution here is not to create "artificial splitting," but rather spare
the good ol' system for the time being and have kbuild25 coexist with it until
all build issues are resolved and everything works acceptably -- and that's
what has been offered. 2.5 is certain to span a long enough period for such
treatment, and Keith will be so kind as to keep updating his work.
Alright I really didn't want to get involved in another kbuild thread but
couldn't help it. Sorry.
