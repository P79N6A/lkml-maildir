Well, up to and including 2.6.28 they needed to echo 'enable' to the USB
controllers' /sys/devices/.../power/wakeup files, so if the patch is reverted,
they won't be worse off than they were day before yestarday. :-)
Perhaps we can choose the default depending on whether or not any HID devices
are attached to given controller?
