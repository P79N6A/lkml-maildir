Thanks for all your contributions ;-) But with noapic I also get APIC
errors from time to time (altough /etc/intrerrupts shows that the
XT-PIC is used). But anyway the box is not running very reliable in
both modes and processes seg-fault every now and then and sometimes
the box freezed. I'll get rid of the box I got for free and no longer
waste our time ... ;-)
