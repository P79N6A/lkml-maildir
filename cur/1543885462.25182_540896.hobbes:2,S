I think the "select" is better.

It has to stay there for external modules.
It's similar to MII - drivers select MII automatically but you can
turn it on (Y or M) by hand as well.
And you can have HDLC=y and driver=m (and it makes perfect sense).
Actually I can't see any bad idea here.
The original dependency was certainly, uhm, not the best one.
