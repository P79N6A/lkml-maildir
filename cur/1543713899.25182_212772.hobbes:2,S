I don't think you sent it to the parisc list?
I'm afraid we've just been pretty heavily updating flush_dcache_page
recently to fill a number of holes in the implementation.
As far as list traversal goes...we don't require the list to freeze:
acidentally flushing dead vmas would be harmless and added ones wouldn't
need flushing, so all we need would probably be a safe traversal and a
reference to prevent the vma being deallocated.
