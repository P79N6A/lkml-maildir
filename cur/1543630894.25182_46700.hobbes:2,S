Huh? There are no patches to go from 2.4.18 to 2.5.anything AFAIK.
I just downloaded linux-2.5.16.tar.bz2 from kernel.org, did tar xvjf, cd, 
make mrproper, make menuconfig, enabled config experimental, and I get the 
ACPI option so something is wrong on your end... This is on ia32 arch.
Which architecture are you using?
