Locking the module does nothing except increase module overhead. The
premise is that we don't care how long it takes to remove a module. It
just must be done safely. So, what we need to do it make certain that...
(1) All calls from the module have returned.
(2) All calls to the module code have returned.
(3) All user-access has completed.
That's what the trap in schedule() does, in conjunction with the
wait-for-timer-ticks. We don't want to have lots of locks and semiphores
that have to be accessed during normal execution paths.

But this doesn't solve the module-removal problem .

Again, it's not the problem I'm addressing.

Good point. Member usecount could be anything. A 'long' isn't the correct
pad for all types, but it will probably handle everything that was
intended.
