You put something from offset 0x100 into %al.

Then you compared it against 1. This is where the comparaison
occurred.

Then you put something else into %ax. Whatever it is, doesn't count.

Then you jumped based upon the comparison you made before you
destroyed the contents of %al by poping %eax (%eax is (%ah << 8) | %al).
If you don't want to muck with registers, just do:
		cmpb	$1, (0x100)
		jz	wherever
You don't need to put memory oprands into registers to compare.

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
