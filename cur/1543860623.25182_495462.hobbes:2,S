	I have not yet performed the 21 steps of
linux-2.6.20-rc3/Documentation/SubmitChecklist, which I think is a
great objectives list for future automation or some kind of community
web site.  I hope to find time to make progress through that
checklist, but, in the meantime, I think the world may nevertheless be
infinitesmally better off if I post the patch that I'm currently
using that seems to fix the problem, seeing as how rc3 has passed
with no fix incorporated.
	I think the intent of the offending code was to avoid doing
a lock_sock() in a presumably common case where there was no need to
take the lock.  So, I have kept the presumably fast test to exit
early.
	When it turns out to be necessary to take lock_sock(), RCU is
unlocked, then lock_sock is taken, the RCU is locked again, and
the test is repeated.
	If I am wrong about lock_sock being expensive, I can
delete the lines that do the early return.
	By the way, in a change not included in this patch,
I also tried consolidating the RCU locking in this file into a macro
IF_NLBL_REQUIRE(sksec, action), where "action" is the code
fragment to be executed with rcu_read_lock() held, although this
required splitting a couple of functions in half.
	Anyhow, here is my current patch as MIME attachment.
Comments and labor in getting it through SubmitChecklist would
both be welcome.
