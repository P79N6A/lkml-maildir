Right, back when I was working on zero copy for 2.4 I noticed that 
2.6 seemed to support aio in the socket code, passing the kiocb 
pointer as I recall, and support in the socket  code for for sendpage
seemed enhanced. I was also wondering about using 2.6 and aio for zero
copy instead of tokens via sendmsg() and recvmsg() cmsghdr structures.
