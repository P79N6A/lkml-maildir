The object of the merge is to save memory, and to reduce the size of the
rbtree that might payoff during other operations (with a smaller tree,
lookups will be faster too). If you only measure the time of creating
and removing a mapping then it should be normal that you see a slowdown
since merging involves more work than non-merging. The payoff is
supposed to be in the other operations.
The reason mlock doesn't merge is that nobody asked for it yet, but it
was originally supposed to merge too (I stopped at mremap since mlock
wasn't high prio to fixup). But the long term plan was to eventually add
merging to mlock too and it's good that you're optimizing it now.
