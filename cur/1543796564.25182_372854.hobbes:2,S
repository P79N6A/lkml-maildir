The SoftMAC is a separate module. That is _good_, so devices like
the ipw do not have to load the code, because they do not need it.
The SoftMAC ties (and integrates) very close to the ieee80211 subsystem.

This is approximately how it works.
You see that SoftMAC is not exactly a part or the ieee80211 subsystem,
but it uses its interface to TX a frame (and the struct to get
some information about the device).
This works without any modifications to the ieee80211 layer and I
doubt big changes will have to be made in future.
In fact, we started with the SoftMAC layer integrated into the
ieee80211 subsystem. You can still find the patches on the project FTP.
We decided to drop it, because of the bad design.
This all works fine. There is absolutely no need to bloat the
ieee80211 layer with functionality, which is not needed by all devices.
