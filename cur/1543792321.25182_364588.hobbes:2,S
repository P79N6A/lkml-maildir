I'm also of the opinion that if we make the kernel remap that we can "remove 
RAM".  Now, we've had enough people weigh in on this being a bad idea I'm not 
going to try it.  After all it is fairly complex, quite a bit more so than Mel's 
reasonable patches.  But I think it is possible.  The steps would look like this:
Method A:
1. Find some unused RAM (or free some up)
2. Reserve that RAM
3. Copy the active data from the soon to be removed RAM to the reserved RAM
4. Remap the addresses
5. Remove the RAM
This of course requires step 3 & 4 take place under something like 
stop_machine_run() to keep the data from changing.
Alternately you could do it like this:
Method B:
1. Find some unused RAM (or free some up)
2. Reserve that RAM
3. Unmap the addresses on the soon to be removed RAM
4. Copy the active data from the soon to be removed RAM to the reserved RAM
5. Remap the addresses
6. Remove the RAM
Which would save you the stop_machine_run(), but which adds the complication of 
dealing with faults on pinned memory during the migration.
