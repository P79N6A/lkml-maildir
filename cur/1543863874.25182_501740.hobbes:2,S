I have not.  I tested the one I sent.  Today I'm at a different location than 
that test environment.  All I can try it on here is Ubuntu, and so could you 
just as easily.
As I said, I'm not particularly interested in a more intrusive solution 
solving a problem I haven't actually seen.  I don't see any obvious reason 
why it wouldn't work, and yes it would probably also solve my problem, but I 
still don't see why you think it's "better" than the three byte fix.
