No worries. That did the trick.
The following message appears just before the first oops:
Nov 27 18:56:32 localhost kernel: bio_add_page: want to add 4096 at 17658 but 
only allowed 3072 - prepare to oops...
second oops:
Nov 27 18:56:36 localhost kernel:  <3>bio_add_page: want to add 4096 at 426874 
but only allowed 3072 - prepare to oops...
And the third:
Nov 27 18:56:39 localhost kernel:  <3>bio_add_page: want to add 4096 at 427002 
but only allowed 3072 - prepare to oops...
Hope that helps. I can give the oops report(s) if you need (but they are once 
again the same "kernel BUG at drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c:1950!").
Thanks.
