Hello all. I've got a Promise SX8 SATA controller and the performance
seems a little off. I'm using a debian-built 2.6.9 kernel and the
read/write I/O seems to level off around 80-90 MB/s. When I use the same
hardware in Windows, sequential I/O goes up to 218 MB/s. (That's about
the limit of my motherboard's buses.) If I move some disks to the
on-board SATA controller, I can get the I/O to go higher but never as
high as in Windows.
Is this a problem with my expectations, my testing, or the driver? 
Some Bonnie numbers for a raid 0 array of Seagate 7200.7's (2 GB file,
sequential, MB/s):
