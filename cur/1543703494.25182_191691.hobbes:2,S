This is already done, they are called "extent"s.  Reiser4 uses them, XFS 
uses them, I think Veritas may have been the first to use them but I am 
not sure of this, maybe it was IBM.

ReiserFS does dynamic allocation of stat data (what stat() returns), we 
don't have inodes.  Many filesystems do dynamic allocation of inodes.

Use a tree to store everything in.  See www.namesys.com for extensive 
details.
