No. The problem is still there. But now lots of losts packets instead of
a total hang.
Due to the modification of mask_irq now disable_irq_nosync and
enable_irq act as if I would press SysRQ+q every millisecond, and thus
the io apic is immediatly reset when it got stuck.
Btw, my initial assumption about EOI to masked interrupt must be wrong:
2.2 always first masks the irq, then it sends the EOI, and 2.2 doesn't
hang.
