Good point.
Looking at vfs_mkdir(), it's pretty simple, and really the only bits
that apply to container_clone() are the call to ->mkdir() and possibly
the call to fsnotify_mkdir(). (I think that's maybe how you did it
originally?)
Maybe it would make sense to just call container_create() at that
point directly, which would allow us more parameters.
