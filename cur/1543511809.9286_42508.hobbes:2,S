RW> How many really need 16?
I would suggest that keyboards and mice certainly need. Imagine a
multihead linux computer with 16+1 heads... the whole computer lab would
consist of one big linux computer with many monitors, keyboards and
mice. Monitors need graphics cards too so many PCI buses are probably
needed but that's another issue. The keyboards and mice should have _at
least_ 16 minors allocated.
