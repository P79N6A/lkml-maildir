Let's see...
1) This increases context switches over a solution that links with 
libcrypto and libssl.
2) "build really lightweight programs with crypto support" implies that 
you think it's a benefit to use the kernel as your crypto lib.  Shared libs
3) Your proposal actually avoids existing, working hardware crypto 
support such as Broadcom's hwcrypto driver which is fully supported by 
openssh.
4) "open it and use ioctls to transfer data" is typically a bad idea. 
ioctl(2) is a historical Unix mistake, to be avoided where possible. 
read(2)/write(2) are to be used to transfer data.
