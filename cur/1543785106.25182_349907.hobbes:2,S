I'm still of the opinion that we should add
	-imacros include/linux/config.h
to the gcc command line and stop bothering with trying to get
linux/config.h included into the right files and not in others.
(which then means we can eliminate linux/config.h from all files.)
From what you can see below, missing includes of it can remain
for months, and it can cause bugs which are rather non-obvious.
