BLKTRACE is a special-purpose tracing facility limited to one subsystem 
and written and maintained by the /same/ person (Jens) who maintains 
that subsystem. He maintains the subsystem, the tracer and the userspace 
tool that extracts the tracer data.
LTT on the other hand is a static tracer that affects _all_ subsystems. 
That is a very different situation from a maintainance overhead POV, and 
i believe you must know that.
your suggestion that this controversy has prevented consolidation in 
this area is baseless and misleading, please correct or retract it.
