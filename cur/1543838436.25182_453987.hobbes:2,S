The synaptics driver itself was not changed for many month, it is the
surrounding code that was changed and somehow it interferes with your
box.

Does it exibit the same behavior when you switch to text console?
Also, is there programs that poll status of your battery or monitor
box's temperature? How often do they do the polling? Have you updated
any of them recently?
Oh, another one... try booting with "ec_intr=0" on the kernel command
line to disable embedded controller interrupt mode.
And finally, can I mples get a dmesg (or /var/log/messages) of boot
with "i8042.debug=1 log_buf_len=131072" please?
