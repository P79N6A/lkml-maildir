  But I think there are workloads for which this is suboptimal to say the
least. Imagine you do some crazy LDAP database crunching or other similar load
which randomly writes to a big file (big means it's size is rougly
comparable to your available memory). Kernel finds pdflush isn't able to
flush the data fast enough so we decrease dirty limits. This results in
even more agressive flushing but that makes things even worse (in a sence
that your application runs slower and the disk is busy all the time anyway).
This is the kind of load where we observe problems currently.
  Ideally we could observe that we write out the same pages again and again
(or even pages close to them) and in that case be less agressive about
writeback on the file. But it feels a bit overcomplicated...
