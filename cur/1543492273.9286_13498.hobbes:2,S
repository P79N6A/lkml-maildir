Can anybody tell me what the ac version of the new kernels means? I'm
currently running 2.2.5 and for whatever reason netscape seems to scroll
slower than 2.0.34...I thought about upgrading further and I keep seeing
ac appended some kernel versions. I've looked around (although I'm sure I
didn't use the right keywords) and I can't find any info on what the ac
is.
Thanks for you help!
Chris
