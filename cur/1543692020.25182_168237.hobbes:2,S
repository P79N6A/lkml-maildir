You forget two things.
First, if the kernel comes up with a bogus partition table, this
will confuse users (and user space) greatly. It is not harmless,
even though you would know how to survive.
Second, if the kernel reads random stuff from flash media that may yield
I/O errors. Such media do often not have blocks at a fixed place, but
have at the start a table that says where on the media a given block lives.
Blocks that have never been written do not occur in the table, and attempts
to read them give an I/O error. (And our famous SCSI error handling may
want to retry a few times, reset the device and retry, reset the bus
and retry .. I have seen boot times of a quarter of an hour because
the kernel was busy retrying SmartMedia accesses.)
In short - we should not read random blocks from a disk on flash media.
