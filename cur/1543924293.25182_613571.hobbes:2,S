Since this is a debug-only type file, why not just put it in debugfs
instead?
And I have a huge patch-series pending that will make adding files like
this to sysfs much easier in the future.  But nice job, it looks like
you got it all correct, which is pretty hard to do first time these days
due to the complexity of the current interface :)
thanks,
