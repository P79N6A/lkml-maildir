ps.  Due to bugs in the kernel build system, you cannot assume that
changing scripts/kallsyms.c or CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL or
CONFIG_KALLSYMS_EXTRA_PASS will be automatically detected.  The make
dependency tree for the kallsyms code is incomplete.
After applying the patch and adjusting the config, touch init/main.c
then make.  Touching a file will force a kernel relink and work around
the incomplete dependency data.
