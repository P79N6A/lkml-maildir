Your mail seems to be about a gpio userspace interface, which is
something entirely different from an in-kernel API, although I suppose
it should be possible to build a userspace interface on top of the
generic in-kernel API.
If you're looking for a way to do GPIO from a driver, the new generic
GPIO API should offer what you need, assuming it has actually been
implemented on your platform.
