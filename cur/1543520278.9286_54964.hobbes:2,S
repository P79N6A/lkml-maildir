     I disagree.  THE net application is HTTP server.  Nothing is more critical
to a presence on the Internet than a robust effecient web server.  It is SO
widely used that it deserves some kernel space if it buys a substantial
performance benefit.  It's an OPTION, you don't HAVE to configure it in.
     In the Linux/NT wars; the ability to provide a better performing web
server, not just in benchmarks, but in real world applications on the net is
going to be a major factor.  I don't see embedded applications as "cheating". 
     One could just as easily argue that TCP/IP should be in user space not in
kernel space, and in fact I've seen some Sys 5r2 systems that DO implement it
as a deamon.  But substantial performance benefits result from it being
incorporated in the kernel, and the same is true of the HTTP, and it's becoming
a common enough application that that protocol deserves kernel space.  It's
usefulness is limited, but it at least gives you a way to serve static content
fast.
