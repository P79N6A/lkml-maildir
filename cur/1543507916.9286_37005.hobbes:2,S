Sure, you can use /etc/modules.conf... both works... I dunno, this is (i
think) a internal option in modutils package, very used in modprobe, to
locate some modules, use aliases for mods, catch parameters pre-defined,
and so on... I don´t know if this can be possible, but maybe location of
this file can be changed, same with the filename... I know that modprobe
location can be changed for kmod, but i really dunno about the
conf.modules...
