I suspect it's somewhat similar (though perhaps a different cause), the 
code is trying to lookup a value (presumably register contents) in a 
table using Match, gets a value that's not in the table (which makes 
Match return the ONES value FFFFFFFF meaning not found) and so the 
lookup of the corresponding output value with that index fails. We'd 
need the full ASL dump to know exactly what's going on there.
