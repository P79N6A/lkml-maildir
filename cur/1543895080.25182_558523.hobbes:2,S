I want the string to be \{ ... '\}' gives me that:
$ perl
$q = '\}';
print "$q\n";
\}

Well I want a combination of variable expanded and not expanded.  I
think there will be a general cleanup to some standard quoting for the
RE's as there are hundreds, and about 7 different quote styles right now.

Hmm really?  Thats not how gcc seems to parse that, it seems to think
its a comment.  Which makes us safe, as the compiler will trip them up.
$ cat test4.c
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
        int _p = 10;
        int *p = &_p;
        int foo = 10 /*p;
        printf("foo=%d\n", foo);
}
$ cc -o test4 test4.c

Yep and we check for that.  But here we are trying to catch a switch and
case at differing levels, we want to catch that whether they got their
spacing right or not.

Well I would tend to say use what works and is easy to understand.  The
semantics of '' and "" are well known, to change to qr{} I would have to
go read the manual to know what it is going to do.  That said, _if_ it
did have the same semantics as m// then it may wel allow all of these to
be expressed as qr{} as it would expand variables but treat \ as if we
were in ''.  So ... to the manual for me.
