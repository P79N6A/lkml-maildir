With all respect. I'm NOT newbie (also in Linux). 2.4.21 is first kernel
version, where I have problems with IDE subsystem (both on old and new
PC).
When I enabled both standard IDE and SiS IDE drivers, errors
("DriveReadySeekCompleteError" and similiar) don't allow system to
start.
When I use SIS IDE only, DMA is not enabled by default (for UDMA 33
devices - earlier in 2.4.20 and earlier IT WAS DONE).
Today I bough new IDE card  with Silicon Image and Silicon Image IDE
driver also shows errors with HDD (which is 100% OK). 
Please treat it seriously. I know, how to configure Linux kernel - I
make it from few years. In 2.4.21 there is REALLY something wrong.
Please do not say, that errors are normal - earlier they didn't exist
and weren't shown anywhere (also in hdparm). I'm here and can give all
required info for tracking bug. Please treat it seriously. When kernel
shows errors in some parameters configurations, doesn't allow to use
some combination of config parameters or when doesn't enable DMA, there
is something wrong.
In attachment config info from hdparm.
Pozdrowienia/Best Regards
