it only works on pointer less kernels because the spinlock profile 
unwinding is _conditional_ on an FP kernel right now:
 #if defined(CONFIG_SMP) && defined(CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER)
 unsigned long profile_pc(struct pt_regs *regs)
 {
 ...
on non-FP kernels you'll see all the overhead in the single spin_lock()
function, agreed?

wchan has only one assumption: that that all __sched section functions
have a valid frame pointer. This is not unrobust at all. (it is
nonperformant though on register-starved platforms and having proper
unwind would fix wchan too.) In fact ->real_pc could be used by __sched
functions as well, it would likely be cheaper (on x86) than having to
compile with -fno-omit-frame-pointers.
