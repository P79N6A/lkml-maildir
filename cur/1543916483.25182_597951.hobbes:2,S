Hmm, I cannot agree it to be fair - but pretty acceptable ;-)
Your patch already brings great improvements in the multi-bdi case.

Sure it is in the extreme case. However the limit could be ensured
if we really want(which I'm really not sure;-) it:
        if (nr_reclaimable + nr_writeback < dirty_thresh &&
                bdi_nr_reclaimable + bdi_nr_writeback <= bdi_min_thresh)
                break;

Thank you :-)
