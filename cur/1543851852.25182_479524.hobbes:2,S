Usually, when you have a problem with some program, you ask the
developer about the bug you have found (or whatever). So you should
ask Ubuntu folks, because the kernels you are using are a "fork" of
the mailine kernel. They add a lot of 3rd party stuff along other
things, so they are the ones who need to solve their problems. I'm
sure there is someone at Ubuntu that can help you for future problems.

Well, you can browse menuconfig without compile the kernel at all...
Just for check if some driver is already in. Anyway, Ubuntu kernels
aren't the mailine ones and they have more drivers.

If you discover a bug in the Ubuntu kernel, you should report it to
Ubuntu developers. Their kernels are "old" and very patched so they
are pretty different. Only report here if the bug appears in the
lastest mainline kernels (like 2.6.18 or 2.6.18.1 right now...).
Anyway, you can always use the lastest official kernel from
www.kernel.org ;-) so if you find a bug you can be sure to report it
here.
