This entry in the DMI blacklist table is missing it's NO_MATCH
tags, which means the struct gets padded instead of filled with
the desired NO_MATCH data which is {255, NULL}
Usually not fatal it seems, but there have been numerous cases
in Red Hat bugzilla where this did get tripped up, and caused
an immediate reset on these boards. Not fun to track down.
