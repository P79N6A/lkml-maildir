Sorry for the typo & confusion caused. I meant in that example as:-
myArmWireless app. compiled with gcc-3.4.x, NOT gcc-4.1.x compiler on
say 2.4.34 kernel (assuming I can build 4.1.x on 2.4.34 kernel).
Now, I've got it about this app funda. Ok! Am coming closer now. I
have these 2 tasks:-
a) Since 2.6 kernel has no issues with gcc-3.4.x, gcc-4.1.x. So I will
build them. No probs here.
b) 2.4 kernel has no issues with gcc-3.4.x to my understanding, but am
not sure about compiling it with gcc-4.1.x? If this is true, how to
build this?
Whole idea is to have 2 compilers (gcc-3.4.x, gcc-4.1.x) on the both
the kernels.
