No, that's fine, we already have to call it before entering the PM
state, so I'll just pass it along and, at the low level, decide how
deep to sleep based on that.
I think I should also add some stats on the amount of interrupts, since
it would be fairly inefficient to keep entering deep PM state on a
machine with typically little timer interrupts but high HW interrupt
(Rusty mentions case of packet forwarding routers or that kind of thing)
