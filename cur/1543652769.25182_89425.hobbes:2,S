actually TF should cleared implicitly in the do_debug or it could get
the single step trap before you can clear TF explicitly in the entry.S.
but it's certainly zerocost to clear it explicitly there too just to
remeber it's one of the bits not cleared implicitly in hardware when
entering via lcall.  However in 2.5 it seems the clear_TF in do_debug is
still missing.
basically you need to add this check in do_debug too:

Yep.
