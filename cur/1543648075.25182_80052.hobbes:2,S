Right.  By coincidence, I found myself thinking about this very problem
as I re-materialized this morning.  If TRY_INC_MOD_COUNT also ors a flag
(which it does now, for other reasons) then:
   1) Clear the mod_inc flag
   2) Unhook the function hooks
   3) Schedule on each CPU
   4) If the mod_inc flag is set, repeat from (1)
This should perform acceptably well, and would only be done in cases
where the existing TRY_INC_MOD_COUNT strategy can't be used.

Why is that harder than bumping a counter that makes preempt_schedule
return without doing anything?
