Pejorative comments aside Pavel, it is valued feedback for end-user
re-assurance. It has also helped swsusp2 get streets ahead of the other
implementations by aiding end-user feedback on a wide range of hardware,
Which would appear to be well worth it? If it's not broke (and is
valuble) why rip it out?
Regards,
Jonathan
