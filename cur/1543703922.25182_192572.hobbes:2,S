Subject: [2.6 patch] disallow DRM on 386

I got the following compile error in 2.6.1-mm5 with X86_CMPXCHG=n.
This problem is not specific to -mm, and it always occurs when you 
include support for the 386 cpu (oposed to the 486 or later cpus) since 
in this case X86_CMPXCHG=n and therefoore cmpxchg isn't defined in 
include/asm-i386/system.h .
The patch below disallows DRM if X86_CMPXCHG=n.
Please apply
Adrian
