The question is a little bit off the kernel discussion, but nevertheless
related:
I am working on filesystem and I need to analyze the filesystem. I wrote a
C program that calls the "getdents" function. The man page says it is
not a good idea to use it but that is the very function I need. The
problem is now I cannot link the program with "getdents", although I can
find it in libc.a with "nm". I tried "readdir 2" the system call version,
but it results in SIGSEGV. What shall I do?
--------code segment
 printf("pass 2: using linux system call getdents\n");
 if( (fd = open("/home/feiliu", O_RDONLY)) <0){printf("open: abort\n");
exit(1);}
 /* if( getdents(fd, &dir, 1) == -1) {printf("getdents: abort\n");
exit(1);};*/
 if( readdir(fd, &dir, 1) == -1) {printf("getdents: abort\n"); exit(1);};
 printf("%d %d %d %s\n", dir.d_ino, dir.d_off, dir.d_reclen, dir.d_name);
-------with getdents
[feiliu@map src]$ nm /usr/lib/libc.a|grep getdents
getdents.o:
getdents64.o:
[feiliu@map src]$ gcc -L/usr/lib -g -o tdir dir.c
/tmp/ccfre2LK.o: In function `main':

-------with readdir 2

exit(1);}
