Well, my test box agrees (I have never ever used devfs, but could lock hard 
in minutes)  mm6 works fine here, so I _think_ it's probably resolved...

I don't think you're missing anything, but I also don't know wtf the 
interaction is.  I put a couple of man-days into looking for it, and came 
up with exactly nada of interest.

Mine locked hard hard hard.  Booted fine, but died reliably under heavy load.
(something seems funky with nmi_watchdog... hard lock = no_more_nmi_ticks 
.  Anybody out there know enough about local APIC to explain why idle=poll 
gives nice 1 second nmi, but everything else depends upon cpu load?... and 
why when hardlock happens, it _stops_)

My box agrees that you're not a loon fwTw :)
