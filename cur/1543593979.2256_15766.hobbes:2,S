modprobe cannot find the file avma1_cs.o. it may not exist at all (check your 
.config ), or the specified path (in /etc/modules.conf) may be wrong.
if neither of these apply to your system, it may be a misconfiguration in 
/etc/modules.conf or a hardware problem.
i cannot help you with pcmcia however. never used it.
cheers,
Hrishi
