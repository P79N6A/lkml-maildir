Hi,
As you can see below, current ACPI implementation concludes it has to use the 
PIC, before it finds the PRT. No occurences of PRT in dmesg before this one.

ACPI: Using PIC for interrupt routing
^^^^
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKA] (IRQs 3 4 *5 6 7 9 10 11 12 14 15)
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKB] (IRQs 3 4 5 6 *7 9 10 11 12 14 15)
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKC] (IRQs 3 4 5 6 7 9 *10 11 12 14 15)
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKD] (IRQs 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 *11 12 14 15)
ACPI: PCI Root Bridge [PCI0] (00:00)
PCI: Probing PCI hardware (bus 00)
vvvv
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Routing Table [\_SB_.PCI0._PRT]
