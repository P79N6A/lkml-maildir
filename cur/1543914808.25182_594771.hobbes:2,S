Thank you Oleg, hopefully I addressed all your comments in v4.

I documented this in v4, but I was wondering if always setting
tsk->exit_state under the protection of lock_task_sighand() would fix
the race.

Seems like this code was copied from kernel/acct.c:acct_collect():
	if (thread_group_leader(current)) {
		pacct->ac_exitcode = exitcode;
		if (current->flags & PF_FORKNOEXEC)
			pacct->ac_flag |= AFORK;
	}

From include/linux/acct.h: executed fork, but did not exec
Except that it talks about fork(2), not do_fork() hence the
thread_group_leader() test to avoid flagging threads.

I put ->signal->group_exit_code if not null, otherwise
leader->exit_code.
Thank again to you and Andrew for the review.
