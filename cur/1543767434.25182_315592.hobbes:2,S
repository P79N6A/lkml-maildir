It does if we are trying to do multiple ptes per hugepage, but we can
actually drop most of that stuff (including ARCH_HAS_SETCLEAR_HUGE_PTE),
and use ptep_get_and_clear() instead.
We only actual have one pte per hugepage, having multiple ptes for the
page range at least for sh/sh64 was roughly an experiment in trying to
get larger ranges working, but this turned out not to be useful, so we
can pretty much switch to the more generic way of handling this.
I have patches that drop this behaviour already, so I'll bounce these
along to Andrew if this goes in -mm.
