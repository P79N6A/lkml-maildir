The patch looks really interesting, it's just a little hard to parse
with all of the s/4096/PAGE_SIZE/ bits around.  Those cleanups, along
with the s/PAGE_SIZE/HARD_PAGE_SIZE/ parts would be great in a
separated-out patch so that the really juicy bits (like the pte
handling) where the new logic is stand out better.  
I think it would help readability to have something like:
#define PAGES_PER_HARD_PAGE (1<<(PAGE_SHIFT-HARD_PAGE_SHIFT))
which would look like this:
-	if (unlikely(!pfn_valid(pfn))) {
+	if (unlikely(!pfn_valid(pfn * PAGES_PER_HARD_PAGE))) {
Instead of having hardpfn_t, would it be more useful to tag the types
with sparse?  That's probably something that other interested parties
could work on.
