Yes. You can set the maximum and minimum allowed frequencies using 
the standard cpufreq interface. Something like:
echo 800000 >  /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq
However, other interfaces to tune this particular governor is not 
there yet. Other tunables that will be exported to user in future are 
Polling interval and CPU utilization thresholds.

AFAIK, P4M does not support EST. You can double check with 
/proc/cpuinfo and look out for EST flag.
