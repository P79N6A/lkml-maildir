I had some unreproducable system crashes with NO watchdog and NO SMP
enabled that do no longer occure since I compile my kernels without
CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL. I don't know if it this is related, but there seems
to be a problem in one of the "Kernel hacking" options that isn't related
to watchdog or SMP.
