dbench isn't scaling as well with the -rmap13b patch.
With 128 processes, dbench throughput is less than 1/3
of mainline.
dbench ext2 32 processes   Average     High        Low
2.5.24                      28.24     28.84      27.30 mb/sec
2.5.24-rmap13b              21.64     23.50      19.71
dbench ext2 128 processes  Average     High        Low
2.5.24                      19.32     21.05      18.05
2.5.24-rmap13b               5.34      5.38       5.30
tiobench:
Sequential reads, rmap had about 10% more throughput 
and lower max latency.  
For random reads, throughput was lower and max latency 
was higher with rmap.  
Lmbench:
Most metrics look better with rmap.  Exceptions
are fork/exec latency and mmap latency.  mmap
latency was 18% higher with rmap.
Autoconf build (fork test) was about 5% faster
without rmap.
