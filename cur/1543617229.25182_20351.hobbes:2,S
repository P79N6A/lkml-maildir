And I guarantee that if Penelope calls up her vendor, she can get
someone to provide her a guaranteed-compatible and *tested* driver that
can be managed by her package manager for less than the price of the
pack of twelve she'll be using with the dude in the penguin t-shirt.
Please try to understand the entire _point_ of distributions and get a
grasp of how vendors work with the kernel, and stop waxing lyrical about
contrived situations.
Tom.
