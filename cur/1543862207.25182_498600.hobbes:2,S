Hi,
I have running Linux Version 2.6.14-rc5-rt7 on ARM EP9302 and
in the most of time all works fine for me, but very seldom
my system crash.
With a JTAG-debugger I dumped out the kernel-log message and saw
following entries:
<4>BUG: unbalanced irq-handler preempt count in timer_interrupt+0x0/0x50!
<4>entered with 00010002, exited with 00000000.
What could be the reason for that? A racing ? If it true, how I can find
it out? BTW, I enabled all debug-options without to get
more information's.
I know this version is totally out-dated, but it is my current playground
to get a deeper understanding and it's a try to fix a problem.
Any hints are welcome!
Thanks,
Harald
