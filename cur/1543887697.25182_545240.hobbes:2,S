One minor glitch here: BAZ may not be a "select"able dependency at all.
Like Al wrote, it could be an <expr> that is something like !SMP etc that
can't be meaningfully selected.
For that case, menuconfig / xconfig could simply show up a dialog
explaining why the user's selection of FOO can't be allowed, and
config/oldconfig/etc can simply refuse to write out the broken .config.
