Thanks for your reply. So the only reason is for rpc auditing? If so,
why not just lock the code that updating the audit information? Now
the code is:
lock_kernel()
rpc_execute()
unlock_kernel().
That means the kernel will be blocked when rpc is executed, which
could take long time. Even if rpc_execute() won't take very long, this
implementation still looks inefficient. That's why I am a little
confused on this point.
Any further thought?
Xin
