Dear Developer,
I am a Linux driver developer now planning to port a USB OTG stack to an embedded device.
I am relatively new to USB architecture. Any information & pointers would be greatly helpful.
I need a proper working USB OTG stack which I am planning to port to my Embedded RTOS calculator.
Can someone point me some information about the development status of the USB OTG stack.
Regards,
Mukund Jampala
