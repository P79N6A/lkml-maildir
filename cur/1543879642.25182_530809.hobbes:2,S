This.  Yes. SAK is noisy and tells you everything it kills.

Is there any swapping going on?
I'm inclined to suspect that it is a problem that has more to do with the
number of processes and has nothing to do with ttys.
Anyway you can easily rule out ttys by having your startup program
detach from a controlling tty before you start everything.
I'm more inclined to guess something is reading /proc a lot, or doing
something that holds the tasklist lock, a lot or something like that,
if the problem isn't that you are being kicked into swap.
