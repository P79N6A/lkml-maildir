Actually, I see a more serious problem with the current "syscall"
interface: it doesn't allow six-argument system calls AT ALL, since it
needed %ebp to keep the stack pointer.
So a six-argument system call _has_ to use "int $0x80" anyway, which to
some degree simplifies your problem: you can only use the indirect call
approach for things where %ebp will be free for use anyway.
So then you can use %ebp as the indirection, and the code will look
something like
games, since that is guaranteed not to be ever used by a system call (it
wasn't guaranteed before, but since the sysenter really needs something to
hold the stack pointer I made %ebp do that, so there's no way we can ever
use %ebp for system calls on x86).
So you _can_ do something like this:
	syscall_with_5_args:
		pushl %ebx
		pushl %esi
		pushl %edi
		pushl %ebp
		movl syscall_ptr + GOT,%ebp	// uses DSO ptr in %ebx or whatever
		movl $__NR_xxxxxx,%eax
		movl 20(%esp),%ebx
		movl 24(%esp),%ecx
		movl 28(%esp),%edx
		movl 32(%esp),%esi
		movl 36(%esp),%edi
		call *%ebp
		.. test for errno if needed ..
		popl %ebp
		popl %edi
		popl %esi
		popl %ebx
		ret

See why this isn't possible right now anyway.
Hmm.. Which system calls have all six parameters? I'll have to see if I
can find any way to make those use the new interface too.
In the meantime, I do agree with you that the TLS approach should work
too, and might be better. It will allow all six arguments to be used if we
just find a good calling conventions (too bad sysenter is such a pig of an
instruction, it's really not very well designed since it loses
information).
