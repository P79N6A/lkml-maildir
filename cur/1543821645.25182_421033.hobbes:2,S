The fundamental problem with SMI is that we CAN'T know what it is doing.
I've seen systems which trigger SMI from a GPIO toggled by a clock.  I've
seen systems trigger SMI from a chipset-internal periodic timer.  I've
seen chipsets route NMI->SMI or even MCE->SMI.  If the BIOS is polling the
error status registers from a periodic SMI, we're GOING to lose data.
The big hammer - turn off SMI - is probably OK on some systems, but is not
a general solution.  More and more hardware workarounds and features are
SMI based.  There are some rather interesting things that can be done in
SMM, *iff* we could get the BIOS out of the way.
