Greetings folks,
   Would it be possible to make a slight change in the listing of the processors selection, especially the Celerons?  It seems it is sort of difficult to tell which Celeron goes into which catagory, when they are using same naming for 3 generations.
   Of interest is the P4 Celerons, which seems to have started at 1.8 GHz.  Would it be possible if we amend it to add this line as this:
Original: "Pentium-4" for the Intel Pentium 4 or P4-based Celeron.
Revised: "Pentium-4" for the Intel Pentium 4 or P4-based 1.8 Celeron or later
   It would help stop the little confusion as I have found out when I compiled the 2.6.2 on Celeron 1.7 and it seems to crash one way or other when I selected the Pentium-4 for compile and after recompiling it to Pentium III, it works fine.
   Not sure on the Pre-Coppermine Celeron, but I do know that there is some confusion on trying to figure out which version of Celeron by looking at the clock speed itself for Coppermine and P4 versions.
