BTW, there's another infrastructure feature I forgot when you asked
what should go in before feature freeze.  And IMHO it's very important
(so why did I forget it..):  IBM's read copy update synchronisation
primitives.  They've shown significant improvements when used for the
file tables, dcache and routing cache, it has been around since before
2.5 forked, SuSE has it in their production kernel for a while, too and 
akpm has it in his tree for while.
Even if those existing users don't get in yet I don't want to miss the
infrastructure in the 2.6 series.
