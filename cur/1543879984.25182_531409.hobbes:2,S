I have in fact seen the message several times and that messages gives
me no reason to believe something needs to be fixed.
It should have said "PLEASE REPORT THIS to drivers@qlogic.com" or
something similar to indicate the severity better.
"An invalid WWPN, what's that?" said the user. :)
How about "FC IDs may conflict and cause miscommunication!  Please
report to driver author so this can be fixed!" or similar?
