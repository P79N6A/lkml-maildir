Hm, I'm thinking a service might have a good reason to want to know the
possible list of nodes as opposed to the currently active membership;
though the DLM as the service in question right now does not appear to
need such.
But, see below.

Right. I thought that the node manager changes for generalizing it where
pushing into sort-of direction 1. Thanks for clearing this up.
