Looking back at bug #10216 the patch is unlikely to help Lars' system
since it doesn't use nohz and there are also warnings about unsynced
TSCs (I just don't know why not for 2.6.27-rc kernels)...

AFAICS this is a special one for measuring stability of the clocksource
only -- by comparing the value returned by a given clocksource with the
reference clocksource.  Normal drivers have no bussiness there...
Anyway I forgot to add that it fixes the issue for me under QEMU (on my
laptop TSC is unstable due to halts in idle) and it could be as well QEMU's
oddity (although it looks like a legit kernel problem).  v2 of the patch
below (updated patch description).

Fixes "Clocksource tsc unstable (delta = -974982308 ns)" problem
under QEMU.
