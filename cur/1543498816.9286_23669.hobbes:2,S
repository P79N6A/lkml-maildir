I have created a patch against 2.2.6 that deals with arbitrary memory
maps. It uses the BIOS int 0x15, eax=0xe820 call to read the map, but
this can be overridden with a command line option. It works fine on
all new machines; however, I have found an old 386 board which gives
odd results. I haven't had time to look into that too much, which is
why I haven't submitted the patch before.
