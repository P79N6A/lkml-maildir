Nah, I think it's an intentional troll.
Either that or somebody who's So naieve they honestly think that having 
different "text mode" and "binary mode" attributes of files (the cr/lf thing) 
can in some strange way actually improve a system.  (Justifying it with the 
way printers work when sent an ascii text stream, despite the fact that most 
printers these days receive postscript or something equally distant from 
ascii after the printer drivers get done with it.  And that text processing 
itself is, regrettably, moving to Unicode.)
