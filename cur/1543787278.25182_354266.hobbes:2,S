Hi Al,
(btw, original subject was wrong, I actually meant /proc/ide/via)

I don't think there is anywhere else that provides the whole range, but I do 
question the usefulness of most of it :)
Here's my previous attempt at this patch:
	http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-ide&m=112630444000358&w=2
If you can point out a way to keep /proc/ide/via around without causing the 
kind of ugliness found above, then maybe Bart can be persuaded to keep it 
around :)

I'm pushing to get a simple patch merged, which adds ID's for a VIA VT6410 
controller. Apparently these are available in PCI-card form as well as 
onboard-PCI-chip form. Bart raised the concern that this driver wouldn't cope 
well with 2 different controllers in use, so I'm trying to address this.
Thanks,
Daniel
