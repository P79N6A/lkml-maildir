There appears to be a lot of developer activity concentrated on getting
sysfs support in various parts of the kernel, and this inevitably leads to
a reworking of kernel object lifetime rules.  I have to wonder if making
these lifetime changes is really a good idea.
Sysfs appears to be mainly used for exporting various adhoc pieces of
information and occasionally for getting various tuning input.  This
functionality is generally ancillary to the main purpose of the
subsystems/drivers that use sysfs.  It seems backward to me that the
lifetime rules of an object should be dominated by this ancillary
functionality.
So, my question - is it really a good idea to rework much of the kernel
object lifetime rules just to support sysfs?
And a related question - couldn't sysfs be taught to atomically drop its
references to external kernel objects and thus obviate the need for all
these lifetime rule changes?
