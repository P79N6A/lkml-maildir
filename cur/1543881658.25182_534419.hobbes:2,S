It is not "just moved". It is in userspace, where we can use liblzf /
gcrypt / ( and vbetool for s2ram/s2both) as libraries. We have about
7000 LoC of userland code (that is not libraries).

Ok, I do not know how big suspend2 user code is, but kernel uswsusp
(4 kLoC) + userland support (7 kLoC) is still smaller than suspend2
kernel code (+ ? kLoC suspend2 userland support).

Yep, sorry about that.

I believe uswsusp user/kernel separation is clean enough. Kernel
provides "snapshot image" and "resume image". (Thanks go to Rafael for
very clean interface).
