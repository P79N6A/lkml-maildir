Hi,
We have a computer with 4 Go of ram, and a matrox meteor frame grabber.
The meteor board need some ram to be reserved and not used by linux,
using mem=<total RAM - 2Mo> kernel parameter (in lilo.conf for me).
If i use a kernel without CONFIG_HIGHMEM enabled, everything goes fine,
but of course i endup with +- 800 Mo of available RAM for linux.
If i add CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G support to my kernel, without mem setting,
the kernel boots, sees about 3800 Mo of RAM, but my meteor doesn't work.
If i use CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G  and mem=3600M , my system doesn't boot,
crashing with an obscure EXT2 error and 'no init found'
Any help ?
