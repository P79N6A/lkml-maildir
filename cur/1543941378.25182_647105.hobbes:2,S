Those two addresses are in the same cache line, but they are *not* in the same 
128-bit ECC block.  This is probably a northbridge problem, not a RAM problem. 
It's not necessarily a hardware problem.  I wouldn't be surprised if you swapped 
CPUs and still got the same result, due to BIOS misconfiguration.
