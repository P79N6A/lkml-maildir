I'm trying to figure something out.  For ppc, in asm/unistd.h, 
__syscall_nr is defined as:
#define __syscall_nr(nr, type, name, args...)	\
	unsigned long __sc_ret, __sc_err;	\
	{					\
<snipped for brevity>
	}					\
	if (__sc_err & 0x10000000)		\
	{					\
		errno = __sc_ret;		\
		__sc_ret = -1;			\
	}					\
	return (type) __sc_ret
Whenever I use this in my code, I get compiler warnings about the 
statment "__sc_ret = -1" since it is assigning a negative value to an 
unsigned int.
Would it hurt anything if I put in an explicit cast, like this?
__sc_ret = (unsigned long) -1;
This seems to get rid of the warnings, and I can't imagine it hurting 
anything.
Am I missing something bad here?
Chris
