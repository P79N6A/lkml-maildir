I currently think so too.

Probably not. All devices (except perhaps custom embedded devices) which 
implement one or another high level protocol will always be accessed 
either by a protocol driver in kernelspace (like sbp2, eth1394, 
video1394) on top of a struct unit_directory, or by a driver or library 
in userspace on top of libraw1394/ raw1394. This is because such devices 
and protocols all implement the ISO/IEC 13213 CSR architecture.

[...]
When a node represented by a node_entry leaves the bus, the node_entry 
is "suspended" and "put into limbo", which is both the same for the 1394 
stack. The node_entry is only "removed" when forced by userspace through 
ieee1394's sysfs interface or when the ieee1394 driver module is 
unloaded. A unit_directory is either "suspended" or "removed", depending 
on what the protocol driver bound to the unit_directory implements. 
This behaviour of ieee1394 is currently not extensively used, but I plan 
to implement capability of sbp2 to survive transient disconnection on 
top of it.
I still haven't tested your driver yet and won't be able to do so during 
the next days...
