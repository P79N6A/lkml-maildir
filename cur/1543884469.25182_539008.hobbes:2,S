This is a sensitive piece of the kernel as you say and we better allow the 
running of two allocator for some time to make sure that it behaves in all 
load situations. The design is fundamentally different so its performance 
characteristics may diverge significantly and perhaps there will be corner 
cases for each where they do the best job.
I have already reworked the slab API to allow for an easy implementation 
of alternate slab allocators (released with 2.6.20) which only covered 
SLAB and SLOB. This is continuing the cleanup work and adding a third one.
