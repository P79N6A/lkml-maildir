Much like LIDS works... You can configure, at build time, the kernel so
you can't switch the LIDS protection at all. Moreover, in case you want
to allow switching LIDS on/off, you can restrict such change to a
program that is running, at most, at the console, or over a serial line.
IMHO, I think that by definition, and programatically, allowing NX/
ExecShield to be turned on and off is an exploitable way of cracking a
system. I'd better like the LIDS approach.
