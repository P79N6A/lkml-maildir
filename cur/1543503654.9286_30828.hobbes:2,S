Subject: [patch] soft-RT latency (kswapd and update not check need_resched)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Benno and Roger reported me that they got bad RT latency running an RT app
_and_ writing tons of data to disk at the same time.
It seems I spotted and fixed at least one of the reasons: kswapd and
sync_old_buffers was not checking if they should reschedule during their
loops (and they can sleep). I sent this patch for testing to Benno and
Roger and it seems it helps quite a bit.
Benno and Roger have the numbers.
(the patch is against 2.2.10)
