From: Randy Dunlap <randy.dunlap@oracle.com>
setcc() in math-emu is written as a gcc extension statement expression
macro that returns a value.  However, it's not used that way and it's
not needed like that, so just make it a do-while non-extension macro
so that we don't use an extension when it's not needed.
