Ummmmm. Last I saw the idea was to simply have the fallback
zonelist for allocations extend into other pgdats ... ;)

Both the current code and classzone will need some adjustments
to work fine (as in: reasonably efficient) with NUMA.
If the classzone idea can be extended to NUMA with more
readable (== maintainable) code than the standard zoned
allocator, I'm all for having it integrated...
(I'm not sure if classzone will have many benefits in
"normal" setups, but with NUMA I can see the idea giving
a lot more performance benefits)

Rik
