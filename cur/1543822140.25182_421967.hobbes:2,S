the problem with this code as it stands is that acpi/mp_register_gsi()
can be called with gsi in any order.  So it is possible
for the compression code above to select gsi_to_irq[n]
and later for the non-compression path to over-write gsi_to_irq[n].
Also, I would prefer that this code be in ioapic_renumber_irq(), as I
think
it is unnecessarily complex to re-number, and then re-number again.
(gsi_irq_sharing() is a separate discussion)
I think this should be model-specific, but if you feel that handling
(gsi > NR_IRQS) here is important in the generic case, then I'm
fine with this being a default ioapic_renumber_irq() handler
that a platform can augment/override.
Re: returning error
At one point acpi_register_gsi() was able to return an error.
However, that was broken when acpi_gsi_to_irq() was created,
and then broken worse when that routine was modified
with gsi_irq_sharing().  if you BUG() on i > NR_IRQS,
that would be consistent wth gsi_irq_sharing().
