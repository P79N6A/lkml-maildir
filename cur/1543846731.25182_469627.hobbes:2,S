Thanks. Above did not work and compiler gave following warning message upon
using __pa_symbol(_text)
error: cast specified array type
Then I specifically typecasted x to unsigned long and it seems to be
fine. 
Regenerated patch is attached.
On x86_64 we have to be careful with calculating the physical
address of kernel symbols.  Both because of compiler odditities
and because the symbols live in a different range of the virtual
address space.
Having a defintition of __pa_symbol that works on both x86_64 and
i386 simplifies writing code that works for both x86_64 and
i386 that has these kinds of dependencies.
So this patch adds the trivial i386 __pa_symbol definition.
Added assembly magic similar to RELOC_HIDE as suggested by Andi Kleen.
Just picked it up from x86_64.
