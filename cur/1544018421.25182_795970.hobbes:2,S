If it lingers, it has a better chance of getting cleaned up here, than
if it lives in -mm, right?

That's up to you as a distro to handle, not much I can do there.
But, if you want a recommendation, some of the drivers in staging came
from the Fedora kernel tree, so you should be enabling them :)

From a support perspective, if I see the TAINT_CRAP flag set, we just
instantly close the bug out.  Already done that a number of times for
openSUSE bugs, with no problems.

What is wrong with it?  Bugs are getting fixed, people are getting use
out of their hardware (hell, Linus is even using one of the drivers),
and lots of developers are cutting their teeth on helping out.
If you don't like it, just disable it in your kernel packages, or
instantly close out the bugs.  The drivers in staging has already helped
out some distros by virtue of including newer drivers than they were
mistakenly using at the time (Ubuntu, I'm looking at you...)
And again, it's helped out users, which is the most important thing
here.
