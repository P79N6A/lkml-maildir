Two comments on this series:
  - the pci_regs.h change I can take right now, that's in the standard
    so it can't hurt to add it now, right?  Is this ok?
  - the patches break the build if you try to build things without the
    whole series applied.  That's not good for users running 'git
    bisect' on Linus's tree.  Can you redo the series so this doesn't
    happen?
thanks,
