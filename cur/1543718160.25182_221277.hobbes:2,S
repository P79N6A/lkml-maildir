No, it won't help in that case.

I guess it would be interesting to run it on a filesystem which has 2k or
even 1k blocksize.  If the corruption then terminates on a 2k- or
1k-boundary then that will rule out a few culprits.
I'd really like to see this happen on some other machine though.  It'd be
funny if you have a dud disk drive or something.
