Appalling or not, it is more accurate to define a SCSI target
properly than equate it to a direct access logical unit (i.e.
a disk). IMO the designers of that driver and associated
applications made exactly the same mistake which they are now
fixing. That driver is also transport specific with support
for iSCSI and iSER. Try writing a SPI, FC or SAS target driver
for scsi_tgt (I failed with SAS).
It could also be noted that if the reader doesn't understand
the description they can most likely say 'N'.
