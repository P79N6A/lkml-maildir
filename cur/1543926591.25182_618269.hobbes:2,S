I think the placement was correct, but the patch itself was made
against a tree that already contained the changes from
use-struct-path-in-struct-svc_export.patch.
nfsd-fix-wrong-mnt_writer-count-in-rename.patch should have used the
old naming ex_mnt and only use-struct-path-in-struct-svc_export.patch
should have changed it to ex_path.mnt.
