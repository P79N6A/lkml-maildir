Subject: [PATCH 0/2] srcu-2: add RCU variant that permits read-side blocking

Updated based on review comments from Andrew and Oleg (thank you!).
Oleg's bug did turn out to be real (thank you, Oleg!!!), so this patch
contains an alleged fix.  It passes a short rcutorture run on x86 and
ppc64, but so did the previous one (more intense testing in the offing).
This patchset depends on the earlier ops-ization of the rcutorture
infrastructure.
As before, series includes:
o	Addition of SRCU primitives and documentation.
o	Addition of SRCU operations to rcutorture.
							Thanx, Paul
