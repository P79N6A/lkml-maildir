Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Mid-month LTP release made.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

In light of the recent problems with the March release and the large amount
of patches applied, it was decided to release another LTP.  This mid-month
release contains all submitted and accepted patches up to 03-21-03.  Since
the April release is only two weeks away (April 3rd), I will wait until
then to create all the various modules and rpm files....this release is
simply: ltp-full-20030321.tgz.  I also didn't update the ChangeLog....this
will be done for the April release.  However, if anyone wants to know what
was changed they may review the ltp-cvs@lists.sourceforge.net archives.
