Indeed.  I didn't catch that.

Ok, so this would entail changing each ipv6 dst_free() call
into one to ip6_dst_free(), which would:
	ip6_garbage_add(dst);
	dst_free(dst);
It would mean that dst_run_gc() would need to have some callback
like dst->ops->gc_destroy() or similar, which would allow ipv6
to delete the dst from it's local garbage list.

I think there is a hole in this idea.... maybe.
If the idea is to scan dst_garbage_list down in ipv6 specific code,
you can't do that since 'dst' objects from every pool in the kernel
get put onto the dst_garbage_list.   It is generic.
They have no identity, so it's illegal to treat any member of that
list as an rt_entry, rt6_entry or any specific higher level dst
type.
