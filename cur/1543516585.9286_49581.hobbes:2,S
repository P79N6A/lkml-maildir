I don't see why. You ask for it, you get it.

Some X servers do. There also exist X servers that use MEDIUMRAW.
MEDIUMRAW may be slightly more efficient, but is almost equivalent.
For the usual keys both scancode and keycode are well known.
For the strange keyboards with unusual scancodes the user can
(via setkeycodes) assign the desired keycodes, so that these
unusual keys work on the console.
When I last looked at the X source (at least five years ago),
it was not possible to teach X about new scancodes or keycodes,
I think.
