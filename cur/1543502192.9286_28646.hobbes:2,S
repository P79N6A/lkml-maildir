what if the md5-verifying function is clobbered itself ?

I think that could be possible, but may be both good and bad :
   - it may be good because lilo's code is now far more accurate than my
     ASM.
   - lilo already has informations about disks, boot files (kernel) ...
   - the disk from which lilo boots the kernel is obviously accessible from
     the bios
   - but : it's not good that lilo completely re-runs a kernel after a crash,
     while the bios may not have completely cleant everything. So we'll have
     to maintain a special flag to force it to dump, and prevent it from 
     booting. If that flag gets a problem during the dump or anything, it
     would be very annoying that lilo can't boot anymore because it would
     always try to dump a crash. Linux mustn't be as crash-sensitive as NT,
     IMHO.
   - if we use the bios to reboot, we loose the buffer in RAM.
A quick reflexion on this makes me think about a scenario like this one :
   - upon crash, the messages are immediately dumped to sector 2 of the
     first hard disk known to the bios. There should be at least one for lilo.
     This space is nearly never used (except by viruses) and can handle several
     sectors of data.
   - the system reboots through the bios.
   - lilo sees anormal data in these sectors and copies them itself to the
     right place, while marking them read.
   - it then reboots completely (hard reboot) to ensure better cleaning.
   - when it gets back, it sees the sectors marked as "read" so it boots
     normally.
Obviously, dangerous points would be :
   1) direct dump to the beginning of the disk. If the dump code is corrupted,
      noone can tell what could happen
   2) it's very important that lilo never enters in a "dump loop" and can boot
      normaly, what ever error could have been detected during the last dump
      attempt.
