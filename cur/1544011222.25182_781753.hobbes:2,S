Hi,
Alpha uses a generic futex implementation, which causes some problems [1].
I've read through the code, and it appears as if the implementation
could be done by using the ldq_l/stq_c instructions, relatively easy I
might add. I'm definitely interested in implementing this, but first...
I have only a few questions.
1) What are the benefits of a native futex implementation, other than
fixing the glibc test failures?
2) Is there a technical reason it hasn't been implemented on Alpha?
3) Am in correct that it could be done with ldq_l/stq_c instructions?
I'm not experienced with kernel development, but I'd like to learn, so
please bear with me.
Thanks,
Matt Turner
