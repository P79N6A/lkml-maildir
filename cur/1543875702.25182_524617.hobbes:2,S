I am sorry for I see this mail so later.
I also sense this. we may need not such a complete layer at all. Although the work of hiddev/rawdev support does not begin, however, as the design, especially, let hiddev/rawdev live in HIDAL, I think this may need a bit of abstract of transport layer.

Nod. HIDAL should not care which transport layer works under it. if so, that is not HIDAL, that is HIDBL(HID Branch instruction Layer) instead of. :D

In current development implementation, the match process still can work in traditional Vendor ID/Product ID way, but it do not reject other means. If the author of driver hope to match for specific HID report, just do it. In fact, the HIDAL only know the result of match process, not how to do it.I think your "generic driver" is same with my "fundamental driver", and "specific driver" is same with "shadow driver" too.
Er, What's mean of your "HUT", HID Usage Table? if so, I think I have already explained we can do it.However, we should supply some convenient API for this work. or HIT is other mysterious thing? ;)

Progress: It seem the shadow basic support works! but It still need more tests.
Good luck.
