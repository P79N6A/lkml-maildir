How about passing _only_ the caps in effect when doing an exec(2) to the
child, fI on that allowing? This gives the effect of fM, but finer-grained.

It would almost always be "none at all": Witness "foo --version"

Not 100% equivalent, as this means setting _one_ bit in the FS gives
(unknown!) capabilities that reside inside the file. Doesn't work at all
for non-ELF executables

- Stands in the way of doing it properly (in the FS) later: What do you do
  with ELF-marked capable executables when the capabilities now reside in
  the FS?
I dont see the "compatible with current tools" at all here, and I don't see
the needed (re)design of the userland tools and procedures either...
