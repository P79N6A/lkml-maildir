Hmm. Some trees do seem to get pulled more often than others.
Linus, is there a upper limit on the number of times you want
to see pull requests? It strikes me as odd, so I'm wondering
if there are some crossed wires here.

Has Andrew commented on why this is proving to be more of a problem?
I've done regular rebases of cpufreq/agpgart (admittedly, they don't
reject hardly ever unless Len has ACPI bits touching cpufreq) without
causing too much headache.

That doesn't sound like the right way to fix the 'caring for my Linus' problem :)

That's unfortunate. If you want someone to scoop bits up and feed Linus,
I'm happy to volunteer for the task, as long as you're still willing
to eyeball serial diffs until I get up to speed.
