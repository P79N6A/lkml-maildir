Thanks for the responses Jeremy and Randy.
I tried taking the acpi dock patch seperately out of the mm patchset by
applying this patch:
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.17-rc6/2.6.17-rc6-mm1/broken-out/acpi-dock-driver.patch
it successfully is applied, and i notice that CONFIG_ACPI_DOCK needs to
be set, so I did a "make oldconfig" after applying the patch, expecting
it to ask me whether or not i wanted to support it... it didn't.  So
then I manually added "CONFIG_ACPI_DOCK=y" to the .config and built the
kernel, but dock.o is never built... what else do i need to do?
If i can't get hot swappable support yet, I might as well get what is
supported for now so I can atleast use it sometimes :)
Maybe this cry for help will spark someone to finish off the work on hot
swapping the optical drive.
Thanks!
George
