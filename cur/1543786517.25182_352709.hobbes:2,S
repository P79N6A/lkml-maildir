it's so early in the bootup that any failure here would probably be 
fatal anyway. But yeah, a comment would be nice.

that doesnt really solve the problem for e.g. Xen, which needs a 
separate page for each GDT. (xenolinux is a separate arch right now, but 
it will/should be merged back into its base architectures) So why not 
solve all the problems at once?
