If it was calling pnpbios_set_resources you probably do.  This means it was
trying to activate a device.  If a device is not active you cannot use it.
This device was most likely a serial port or modem.  Try turning on PnP
Debug after applying the below patch and see if a device is activated.

Oops.  I put the pnpbios_kmalloc in the wrong place.  It's amazing it still 
worked on my test box.  Here's a patch that should fix it.  Justin: could you
please try it.
Thanks,
Adam
The typo appears to be in pnpbios_set_resources.  Andrew: Is this where you 
found it?
