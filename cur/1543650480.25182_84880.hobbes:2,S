Kernel is 2.4.20-rc1, X is 4.2.0-8 from RH.  The X log reports:
(--) Chipset ATI Rage 128 Pro ULTRA TF (AGP) found
Warnings/errors are:
(WW) R128(0): Can't determine panel dimensions, and none specified.
       Disabling programming of FP registers.
(EE) R128(0): No DFP detected
The Dell packing list reports: 32MB ATI RAGE ULTRA 4X AGP.
Probably should take this off linux-kernel....
