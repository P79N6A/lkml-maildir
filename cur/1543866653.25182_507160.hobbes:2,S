100% agreed.
I've been used to a notebook (VAIO) which did not correctly shut down, and
did not support reboot. Now the one I have behaves normally on both features.
I've never ever felt the need for suspend/resume, that I've always attributed
to "geeks" requirements. I had to debug the shutdown code myself for the
previous notebook, and discovered that it was caused by bugs in the ACPI
state transitions for suspend and such fancy features. I would really have
prefered that the people writing the ACPI code had focused first on power-on/
power-off before the rest.

I think we should even proceed in the opposite direction : refuse to suspend
if at least one driver does not support the feature, and enumerate the
faulty drivers on the console. While I agree that a machine which resumes
in a bad state is not funny at all to debug, at least when the user expects
his notebook to suspend and sees that it refuses, he can complain about the
drivers which do not support it, and can even unload them first if unneeded.
