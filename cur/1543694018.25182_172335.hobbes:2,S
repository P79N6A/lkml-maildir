| Or maybe there are bugs in both of these front-ends.  I finally thought of

| # USB Human Interface Devices (HID)
| #
| CONFIG_USB_HID=m
| CONFIG_USB_HIDINPUT=y
| # CONFIG_HID_FF is not set
| # CONFIG_USB_HIDDEV is not set
| 
| #
| # USB HID Boot Protocol drivers
| #
| # CONFIG_USB_KBD is not set
| # CONFIG_USB_MOUSE is not set
| # CONFIG_USB_AIPTEK is not set
| # CONFIG_USB_WACOM is not set
| [...]
| 
| OK, aside from making me wonder what HIDDEV refers to and why it isn't set,

| 
| In the .config generated by make gconfig, the following lines exist:

| # USB Human Interface Devices (HID)

| CONFIG_USB_HID=y
| CONFIG_USB_HIDINPUT=y
| # CONFIG_HID_FF is not set
| CONFIG_USB_HIDDEV=y
| # CONFIG_USB_AIPTEK is not set
| # CONFIG_USB_WACOM is not set
| [...]

Let me see if I am understanding this..
Is the problem that some generated .config files contain different
strings for options that are _not_ set, depending on which
front-end is used?
Or are you discussing a bug in the (on-screen) viewable part of a
config front-end?
If so, I'll confirm that different config front-ends generate different
.config files, and it makes using "vi .config && make oldconfig"
not as usable as I'd like it to be, but I don't know that it's a bug.
