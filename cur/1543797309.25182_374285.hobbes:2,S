OK this would get all device ids into the database, but it would not say anything about how well the device is supported. It could be anything from the moment you add it / partial support /  pick this - excellent hardware choice random for newbie
So how about the kernel testing discussion months ago. Should there be a progam that people/developers could run, if they wanted to, that collects information from the current kernel and before sending it to kernel.org it asks the user about how happy he is with the hardware currently connected/installed to the machine.
Alternatively/Additionally you have an automated database and people keep adding things in a wikimanner to it, with some apropriate structure to it.
But still, if even bugzilla is not the perfect tool, can it be improved?

Dirk
