Yes, udev, mdev, and a few other tools people use to populate /dev
from the kernel supplied device information.

It's a special case, where two "struct device" have the same dev_t,
but they both point to and handle the same device, so it's fine. The
usb_device class is deprecated, no recent distro uses it, and will be
removed some day.
The /sys/dev/ is handled properly by doing:
  usb_classdev_class->dev_kobj = NULL;
