Besides other possibilities, a bug in the kernel could be the cause. 
Please check if any process (one or two) is in uninterruptible sleep. 
(using ps axl the state is D)
Furthermore, Magic SysRequest+T (alt-print-t) and the dmesg output could 
give some hints.
If there is nothing suspicious you might try some profiling tool, e.g. 
OProfile. 
There was another bug report about a wrap around load average. I dont know 
if both reports are related. 
cheers
