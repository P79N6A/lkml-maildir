"device specific system call". When I hear that I worry. It means someone
didnt get the model

Your driver specific mmap routine can set up specific vm ops if it needs to.

It sounds like you are fighting the system not using it. Your PCI board
is a device. You open it, mmap it and close it. It may not be the API you
want to present to an application but that is a user space library
issue.
