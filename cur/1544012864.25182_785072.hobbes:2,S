Subject: 2.6.28: How come some kernel options cannot be disabled for non-existent hardware?

Example:
-> ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) Support
-> -*-   Dock
From dmesg:
[    0.247210] ACPI: EC: Look up EC in DSDT
[    0.249987] ACPI: Interpreter enabled
[    0.249990] ACPI: (supports S0 S5)
[    0.250005] ACPI: Using IOAPIC for interrupt routing
[    0.254621] ACPI: No dock devices found.
[    0.254631] ACPI: PCI Root Bridge [PCI0] (0000:00)
I have no Docking bay on my desktop machine, even when I change:
CONFIG_ACPI_DOCK=y
to
CONFIG_ACPI_DOCK=n
It still shows up as enabled and it is in dmesg shown above.  How come 
some kernel options are enabled and cannot (easily?) be disabled for 
hardware that does not exist in my machine?
