You can use the latest drivers (6629) with this patches:
http://www.minion.de/files/1.0-6629/
They work fine up to -rc2.
If you want to use the driver with -mm, you have to kill the support
for AGPGART in nvidia driver, add -DNOAGPGART to EXTRA_CFLAGS in the
makefile. It will require a big change to use the multi-agp patches
in -mm. But you are restricted to those AGPs supported by nvidia
(ah, and don't load any agp related module...).
Ah, just a ton of workarounds....
