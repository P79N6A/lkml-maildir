- this doesn't work for people using distribution kernels
- "by replacing the new one from some older kernel" doesn't sound
  reasonable - 3 or 4 point releases later it will have become pretty
  unlikely that the driver will still work unmodified
  (if you disagree, please name one ISA driver where the 2.6.15 version
   compiles without any modifications in 2.6.19-rc3)

Sure, but see my comment above.
