At the time this code was developed, inotify was not in the kernel. We would 
be patching against another patch that's not in the kernel.

The problems that we are faced with are dictated by CAPP and other security 
profiles. The audit user space access has been in the kernel for over a year, 
so that's not really a good thing to go changing.

That's what Tim's email was providing. Its a new component.

Right. You get a few warnings due to missing functionality. If the kernel were 
patched with Tim's code, it all works as expected. We have worked out the 
user space access and that shouldn't be changing.
