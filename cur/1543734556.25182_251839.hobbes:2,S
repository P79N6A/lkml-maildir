No, as long as you don't keep the routes from the old session until the
new one establishes and fills up (or you reach the timeout). And when I
spoke about "connection errors", I really spoke about connection
establishment. I bet you'll have more difficulties trying to send the
right RST just after a SYN (or an ICMP unreachable with the right payload)
than sending them once the session is already established. It does make
a big difference.
