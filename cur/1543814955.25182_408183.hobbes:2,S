Sorry, I did mean to post a link to the latest efibootmgr that has
this fixed:
Home page: 
http://linux.dell.com/efibootmgr/
For distros that care about 32-bit EFI, please upgrade to efibootmgr 0.5.3.
http://linux.dell.com/efibootmgr/efibootmgr-0.5.3.tar.gz
http://linux.dell.com/efibootmgr/efibootmgr-0.5.3.tar.gz.sign

Thanks,
Matt
