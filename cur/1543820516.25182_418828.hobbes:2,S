Well you'd want to optimize for the busy case, right, no point in
optimizing for a more idle system.
I'm not at all uninterested in this, I'd just like to see a more
intelligent/controlled work load that actually stresses the io subsystem
being profiled. If you have a not-so-busy system, you like don't do
enough IO to trigger a lot of merges. Or maybe you do, and we just have
a bug somewhere so that we unfortunately repeatedly recount segments.
Care to run a simple io benchmark and profile that?
