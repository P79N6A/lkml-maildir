NT has a facility to monitor changing files.  You could run a daemon :-)

Not just NFS.  It's me when I back-touch files to control Make (Emacs
backtouch-mode ;-), or rename files, or my CMOS clock breaks, or I have
to do an fsck.  The last applies especially to kernel development on one
machine...
Just checking 100GB of files _locally_ is pretty tedious.
Heck, just calling _stat_ on a typical source tree can be immensely time
consuming over NFS.  Like, a minute.
