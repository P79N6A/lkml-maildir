If user want to get RNG data at full speed we do not want to allow it?
Something changed in the world...
User actually do not want to use xstore, but only read from /dev/random.
If kernelspace can assist and driver _knows_ in advance that data
produced is cryptographically strong, why not allow it directly
access pools?
