Well this should happen even when sysrq is NOT compiled into the kernel...

Not a bug - just an easy-to-disable "feature" - read on ;)

Well that "print-screen" key is usually bound to ^\ :
% dumpkeys | grep 'e  99'
keycode  99 = Control_backslash
        control alt     keycode  99 = Meta_Control_backslash
Now by default ^\ is bound to sigquit - and should be as quite a few
programs depend on that...
% dumpkeys | grep [^_]Control_backslash
keycode   5 = four             degree           dollar
Control_backslash Control_backslash
        altgr   control keycode  12 = Control_backslash
        control keycode  43 = Control_backslash
keycode  99 = Control_backslash
Looks like there're quite a few ways to generate ^\ - so disabling one of
them won't hurt:
% echo 'keycode  99 = VoidSymbol' | loadkeys
(Note that this leaves all the "modified" versions of sysrq to do whatever
they were already doing - so shift-printscreen will still generate ^\)
In any case putting that somewhere in your bootup scripts should solve it ;)
(or even users' login scripts as Linux allows anyone to screw up the
keyboard mappings - why?!)
