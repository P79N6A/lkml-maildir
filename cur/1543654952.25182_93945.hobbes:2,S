Not really, that can all be taken care of in the platform implementation.
The parisc implementation has exactly that problem.  The platform 
implementation uses the generic device platform_data to cache the iommu 
accessor methods (it actually finds the iommu by walking up the device parents 
until it gets to the iommu driver--which means it needs to walk off the PCI 
bus).
In general, the generic device already has enough information that the 
platform implementation can be highly bus specific---and, of course, once you 
know exactly what bus it's on, you can cast it to the bus device if you want.
