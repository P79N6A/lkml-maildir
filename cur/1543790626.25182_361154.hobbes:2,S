OK, I wasn't as thorough as I had hoped re: 64-bit kernel/32-bit
userspace. The uid_t and gid_t types appear to present a problem to the
following:
User  <-> Kernel
i386  <-> x86_64/IA64
sparc <-> sparc64
s390  <-> s390x
:(
	I'll look at this some more and see if I need to resubmit. Until then
I'll hold off on my request for inclusion in -mm.
Cheers,
