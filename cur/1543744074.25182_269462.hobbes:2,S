ok, i've done some other things here and built kernels from
2.6.10-rc1-bk13 and all were giving the oops:
http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/prinz/2.6.10-rc1/config-2.6.10-rc1-bk13
http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/prinz/2.6.10-rc1/dmesg-debug_oops-2.6.10-rc1-bk13.txt
the config is the same config i am usually using, never gave me a
headache, new options (due to new kernel version) were left to default in
most cases. anyway - i've pulled again a recent tree, did
"bk undo -a1.2463" again but this time i stripped down my .config (via
menuconfig) to the absolute necessary things:
http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/prinz/2.6.10-rc1/config-2.6.10-rc1_a1.2463_take2
...and  it did *NOT* oops:
http://www.nerdbynature.de/bits/prinz/2.6.10-rc1/dmesg-no-oops-2.6.10-rc1_a1.2463.txt
i'll investigate further, building former -bk snapshots, using other
configs before i'll fiddle around with bk again (to get the smaller
changes). but this is a tomorrow thing, real life calls in :(
Thank you all so far,
Christian.
