Hi,

Is coredump_setting_sem a global semaphore?  If so, it prevents concurrent
core dumping.  Additionally, while some process is dumped, writing to
coredump_omit_anon_shared of unrelated process will be blocked.
So we should use per process or per mm locking.  But where should we
place the variable for locking?  Because we don't want to increase the
struct size, we might want to add another bit field in mm_struct:
	struct mm_struct {
		...
 		unsigned char dumpable:2;
		unsigned char coredump_in_progress:1;      /* this */
		unsigned char coredump_omit_anon_shared:1;
		...
And we use it to determine whether core dumping is in progress or not:
 	int do_coredump(long signr, int exit_code, struct pt_regs * regs)
 	{
 		<setup vars>
 
 		spin_lock(&dump_bits_lock);
		current->mm->coredump_in_progress = 1;
		spin_unlock(&dump_bits_lock);
		...
Additionally:
 	static ssize_t proc_coredump_omit_anon_shared_write(struct file *file,
 						    const char __user *buf,
 						    size_t count,
 						    loff_t *ppos)
 	{
 		<setup vars>
		ret = -EBUSY; 
		spin_lock(&dump_bits_lock);
		if (mm->coredump_in_progress) {
			spin_unlock(&dump_bits_lock);
			goto out;
		}
		mm->coredump_omit_anon_shared = (val != 0);
		spin_unlock(&dump_bits_lock);
		...
Do you think which is better this method or passing argument method
used by my patchset?
Or, are there even better way else?
