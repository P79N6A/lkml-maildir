I managed to turn off the DVD burner by suspending the laptop to disk
and reviving.
Now the command
cdrecord -tao dev=ATAPI:0,0,0 speed=8 /home/clock/cdrom.iso
is behaving like in those good olden days before Linux kernel seizure.
More information: dmesg reveals that during the seizure, no dmesg
messages were generated (no SCSI errors/timeouts etc.).
When mounting the first badly burned CD, SCSI errors were generated.
Last 3 of them:
hdc: media error (bad sector): status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete
Error }
hdc: media error (bad sector): error=0x30 { LastFailedSense=0x03 }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
end_request: I/O error, dev hdc, sector 8
printk: 2 messages suppressed.
Buffer I/O error on device hdc, logical block 1
hdc: media error (bad sector): status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete
Error }
hdc: media error (bad sector): error=0x30 { LastFailedSense=0x03 }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
end_request: I/O error, dev hdc, sector 16
hdc: media error (bad sector): status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete
Error }
hdc: media error (bad sector): error=0x30 { LastFailedSense=0x03 }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
end_request: I/O error, dev hdc, sector 0
