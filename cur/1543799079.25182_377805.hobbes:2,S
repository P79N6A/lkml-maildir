Why? It is just a plain increment of a location that will almost certainly
be in cache. I can't see how it would be more than half the cost of the
irq implementation (based on looking at your measurements). How do you
figure?
Also, preempt_disable is a very frequent operation on preempt kernels so
if you have CONFIG_PREEMPT then you don't care about preempt_disable in
down() (and if you do then you are calling down too often).

I guess there is no bother for you, but maintaining code for 1 generic
platform versus two dozen architectures is a huge win for many.
