I received a note from Michael T. Babcock noting that there already
is a digest operated by yahoogroups.com (formerly egroups.com):

If you don't care for the advertising that comes with it, I've been
informed there's a site that hopes to make a Mailman server publically
available to carry linux-kernel as a digest also.  They have to be
prepared for 3000 digest users, since that's what vger.rutgers.edu
used to carry.  Watch the list for a public announcement.
