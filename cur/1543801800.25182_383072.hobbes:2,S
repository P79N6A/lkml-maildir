These are original IBM patches to the linux kernel to get the kernel 
running on there thin client. There are some others, which fixes some 
oddities in the hardware. The thin client is about 99% pc compatible. It 
  lacks of a realtime clock, so IBM has a patch to get the time from 
within the NFS protocol.
There are some more but they are not importent to get the kernel up and 
running.

The boot process is very different and has nothing to do with that one 
on a PC. The method I use mounts a NFS share, downloads the kernel and 
does the unmount. Afterwards the kernel gets started.
The kernel commandline parameters are passed  from within the firmware.
Besides, the firmware itself is aware that it has to load a linux kernel.
The patch below sets a fixed value for the address where the commandline 
resides. This is not my problem to understand.
But to transfer this handling to the 2.6. kernel I need a real 
understanding of how the 2.4 kernel does commandline handling and how it 
has changed in 2.6 kernels. Then it seems possible to change the 2.6 
startup code to get the 2.6 kernel running on a 8363 Thin-Client.
