Forgive the mind-numbing question but, it says, "But the AOL software
could be configured to override Windows and launch a version of Red
Hat's Linux operating system, sources said."
Now, my idea of overriding Windows is blowing it away, or at least
making the system dual-boot.  I'm having trouble reconciling the
concepts.  Can anyone shed some light?
