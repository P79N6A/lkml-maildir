Hi jeff,
Thank you for your quick reply.
According to your mail I believe I had to write a SATA low-level
driver only for
2.6 kernels.
But I have a problem my other drivers are 2.4.25 compliant. So it is a huge work
to make all other drivers 2.6 compliant and use libata-core.c.
I believe it is far more easier to have 2.4.x libata rather than
porting my drivers to
2.6.x.
What do you suggest me ?
Regards,
balani
