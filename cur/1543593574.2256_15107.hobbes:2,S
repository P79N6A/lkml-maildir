Ok, I was not aware of that stipulation. So to be very strict in the
interpretation, if there is a module export that is in the -ac kernels, ACME
could not make a binary module that depends on it until/if it makes it to
Linus' tree. Hmmm, Ok.

Right.  The GPL still allows one to "embrace and extend" it :-)
