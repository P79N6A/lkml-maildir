M$ has a whole division dedicated to plug-and-pray developers.
When their USB disk, camera, or whatever gets "approved", its
name is put into W$ even without installing any "drivers".
That's why W$ is so large. It would be good if somebody
started to do something like that for Linux, perhaps a
database from which configuration stuff could be extracted.
It's not a kernel issue, so some distribution really should
take it up.
Of course, the work needs to be done correctly so you don't
get the M$ problem of; "Everything was working until I installed
my new printer...." Whereupon you install everything from a
newly-formatted hard-disk, all over again, installing the
new printer first!
Cheers,
