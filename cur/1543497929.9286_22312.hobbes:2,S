framing/carrier errors are consistent with a hardware problem or low level
driver problem. The framing is done in hardware, carrier errors are hardware
and framing on rx errors are hardware level. What devices are you using for
this ?

ping -f is a meaningless test, it generates no long back to back frames,
and few frames with pessimal ethernet clocking.
