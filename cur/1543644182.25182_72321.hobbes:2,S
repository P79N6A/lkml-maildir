That seems a reasonable thing to want to do.

Does it need to be this fancy?  Why not just have:
        if (core_name_format is unset)
                use "core"
        else
                use core_name_format/nodename-uid-pid-comm.core
which saves all that string format processing, while giving
people everything they could want?
