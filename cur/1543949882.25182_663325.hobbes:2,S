to keep it simple for now. Some of the other 24 architectures are 
seriously under-tested and while we can make sure x86 works well, i dont 
test the others. If it works out fine on x86 it can be generalized.

i really wanted to name it 'optimize' - because that's what it does. We 
just lost 2 years of uninlining advantage due to CONFIG_FORCED_INLINING 
not working and nobody actually connecting the dots that the lack of 
'forced inlining' should have resulted in a 'smaller image' and report 
it as a bug.

i think people know that, but i'll add it.

i dont know why they there are so many variants, but all of them seem to 
be used throughout the kernel:
   inline    : 25648
 __inline__  : 1380
 __inline    : 368
so obviously the patch has to cover them.
a few stats about inlines btw:
- in v2.6.24 there were 26452 inlines in the kernel in 8083114 lines of 
  code - or one inline per 305.6 lines of code.
- in v2.6.25-rc3 there are 27396 inlines in the kernel in 8387992 lines 
  of code - or one inline per 308.2 lines of code.
at that rate, all inlines will be removed in about 117.5 kernel cycles - 
which, if we count with 90 day release cycles, will be finished in about 
29 years.
if we only look at include/linux/ files [which have the largest inlining 
effect], the rate of inline removal is in fact negative: in v2.6.24 we 
had one inline per 59.1 lines, in 2.6.25-to-be we have one inline per 
57.9 lines.
so i'm not holding my breath and i'm going for the much more immediate 
benefit of CONFIG_OPTIMIZE_INLINING=y.
