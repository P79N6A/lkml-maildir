Hello, 
We sent you an email a while ago, because you now qualify 
for a much lower rate based on the biggest rate drop in years. 
You can now get $370,000 for as little as $650 a month! 
Bad credit? Doesn't matter, low rates are fixed no matter what! 
Follow this link to process your application and a 24 hour approval:
