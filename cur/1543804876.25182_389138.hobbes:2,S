We really should give those things a more appropriate name.
ext2_set_bit() is non-atomic, so the above code must provide its own
locking against other CPUs (and threads, if preempt) performing
modification of this memory.
Is such locking present?  If not, we should use ext2_set_bit_atomic(). 
(And if so, the old code could have used __set_bit)
