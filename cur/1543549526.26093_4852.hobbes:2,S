firstly, I have no understanding of IO_APIC vs. legacy IRQ handling in i386
hardware so what I say may be completely wrong.  I'll explain my circumstance
and we'll go from there.
Legacy would be just fine, but ISAPNP is attempting to assign an IRQ that is
unavailable on my system.  In otherwords, the BIOS has assigned it to some
other function and thus the IRQ doesn't appear to Linux as even existing.
In my case IRQ5 was assigned to "DISPLAY CONTROLLER" and IRQ5 isn't available
to the system, excerpts from dmesg:
...
Bus #2 is ISA
I/O APIC #2 Version 17 at 0xFEC00000.
Int: type 0, pol 0, trig 0, bus 2, IRQ 04, APIC ID 2, APIC INT 04  *** NO ISA IRQ 5 ***
Int: type 0, pol 0, trig 0, bus 2, IRQ 06, APIC ID 2, APIC INT 06
...
ENABLING IO-APIC IRQs
...changing IO-APIC physical APIC ID to 2 ... ok.
Synchronizing Arb IDs.
init IO_APIC IRQs
 IO-APIC (apicid-pin) 2-0, 2-5, 2-10, 2-11, 2-17, 2-20, 2-21, 2-22, 2-23 not connected.
                             ^ no IRQ 5 ?
...
 IRQ redirection table:
 NR Log Phy Mask Trig IRR Pol Stat Dest Deli Vect:
 04 003 03  0    0    0   0   0    1    1    49
 05 000 00  1    0    0   0   0    0    0    00   *** IRQ 5 ??? ***
 06 003 03  0    0    0   0   0    1    1    51
Yet ISAPNP decided to assign that IRQ5 to my NIC.  ne.c fails to operate
when there are plenty of other IRQs still available.
The difference is in this logic between _no_ IO-APIC and _yes_ IO_APIC
in isapnp.c
        isapnp_for_each_dev(dev) {
                if (dev->active) {
                        if (dev->irq_resource[0].start == irq ||
                            dev->irq_resource[1].start == irq)
                                return 1;
                }
        }                                                                  
since w/o IO_APIC no PIC->APIC IRQ transform is done and this returns 1
and IRQ 5 is not used.  With IO_APIC no match occurs and the system attempt
to use IRQ 5, thus a hung system.
Hence, my attempt to rule out APIC IRQs that were unavailable to the system,
also assuming the legacy IRQs would also not be available.  This may not be
globally true, but seems to be on my system.  Abit BP6, nu Bios.
This entire problem would not have bothered me too badly, had the system
come up and run, but w/o explicitly telling the BIOS to reserve an ISA
IRQ ISAPNP eventually decides to try IRQ 12.  IRQ sharing with PS/2 mouse
and ne.c fail miserably.  On 2.2.X I had been using IRQ9 for ne.c card.
With 2.4 IRQ 9 is listed after IRQ 12 in xtab[16] (isapnp.c) so the system
fails to boot.
> Especially as they seem to be acceptable if there are _no_ IO-APIC irq's.
Only if they work. ;)
More info on request or tell me to go away, _grin_ again.
