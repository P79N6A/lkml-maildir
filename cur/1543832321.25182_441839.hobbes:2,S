No, I don't. From my point of view, uswsusp is misdesigned, but suspend2 
isn't. Suspend2 keeps the stuff that ought to be done by the kernel in the 
kernel. It doesn't shift data out to userspace, only to copy it straight back 
to the kernel for I/O. It will keep working even if userspace crashes and 
burns. It leverages support for compression and encryption that's already in 
the kernel. It does a real image of memory, not a half-pie attempt that 
causes lots of faulting of pages etc post-resume. If there's any misdesign in 
Suspend2, it's that I haven't made it a special case of checkpointing. But, 
of course, there's no support for checkpointing in the rest of the kernel at 
the moment anyway.

It looks simple, I agree. But that's only because it's doing the minimum 
required.

I agree that I didn't do the best job of making the reviewer's life easy. But 
let's give me some credit. I did all those patches because I genuinely 
thought that's what was requested the last time I submitted patches for 
review. I didn't like splitting up the files into all those patches - it was 
a lot of work and took a lot of time. But I did it because I wanted to do 
what was asked and wanted to do what was necessary to get a good 
implementation into the vanilla kernel.
Frankly, I'd rather be working on improving drivers and helping implement the 
run-time power management than working on getting Suspend2 merged. But for 
now, this is the immediate task.
I don't know why you see the user interface code as a problem. All the kernel 
is doing is telling the userspace program, via a netlink socket, what's going 
on and receiving messages from the userspace program sometimes.

Removing /proc isn't a big task. It will affect the hibernate script far more 
that the kernel code. The user interface is already in userland.

I don't want to fork anything. I didn't fork swsusp to start with, and I don't 
want to start forking things now. (If you want to debate that point, can you 
check the mailing list archives on Sourceforge, Berlios and suspend2.net 
first? You'll find that I just carried on where Florent left off).

With your current design, I don't see how you're ever going to get to the 
level of functionality that Suspend2 has. I'm of course thinking of a full 
image of memory (although Rafael's patch a while back looked hopeful there) 
and support for other-than-just-one-swap-partition.
