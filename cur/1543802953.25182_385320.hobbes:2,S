That is a little on the warm side, I believe AMD's posted limit
is 70C for most of their chips, assuming the measuring point is
in the correct place for the 70C limit.
Certain cpus also seem to have more issues than others, so one cpu
out of a batch can be ok with a certain setup, and another from the
same batch will mce under similar conditions.
Did you build the machines yourself or did you buy them this way?
Machines getting MCE's that often will fail the burnin testing that
we use here.
And machines that produce those kinds of temps will also fail our
burn-in process just because that seems a bit too warm.
