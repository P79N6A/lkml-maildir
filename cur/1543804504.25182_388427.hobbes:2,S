Yep, 
http://kerneltrap.org/node/5654
 suggests [to me] that the repacker be 
finished first before it's of good use
  "Hans Reiser: Our fsync performance is not optimized yet, and will be bad 
  until it is optimized. Our performance for fully random modifications 
  will be bad until we ship a repacker." (kerneltrap article from September 
  13 2005)
