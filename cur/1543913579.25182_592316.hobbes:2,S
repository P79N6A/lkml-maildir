see section 7.2.3 of intel volume 3A...
"Code dependent upon sequential store ordering should not use the string 
operations for the entire data structure to be stored. Data and semaphores 
should be separated. Order dependent code should use a discrete semaphore 
uniquely stored to after any string operations to allow correctly ordered 
data to be seen by all processors."
i think we need sfence after things like copy_page, clear_page, and 
possibly copy_user... at least on intel processors with fast strings 
option enabled.
