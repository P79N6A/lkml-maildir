Hi,
svgalib needs to be compiled without background support in order to run
under kernl 2.4.0 or newer. Here's a patch to Documentation/Changes that
says this.

+=======
+If you want svgalib programs to run with kernel 2.4.0 or newer, svgalib
+needs to be compiled without background support (BACKGROUND not defined in
+Makefile.cfg). This is relevant to any svgalib version.
+This is because svgalib uses mmap of /proc/mem to emulate vga's memory bank
+switching when in background, and kernel 2.4.0 stopped supporting this feature.
