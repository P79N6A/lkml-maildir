The problem hasn't changed in a few decades, neither has the urge of 
developers to make their app look good at the expense of the rest of the 
system. Been there and done that myself.
"Back when" we had no good tools except to raise priority and drop 
timeslice if a process blocked for i/o and vice-versa if it used the 
whole timeslice. The amzing thing is that it worked reasonably well as 
long as no one was there who knew how to cook the books the scheduler 
used. And the user could hold off interrupts for up to 16ms, just to 
make it worse.
