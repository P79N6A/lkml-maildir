Quilt is very good at doing this kind of thing.

It keeps all your patches in a "patches" subdirectory and makes going 
back and fixing previous patches very easy (git makes this quite hard). 
You can rsync your patches/ directory to any webserver, and anyone else 
can save them in a patches subdirectory and apply them in the same way 
(the equivalent of sharing your tree).
