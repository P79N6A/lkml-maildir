I will be fully back in business next week. Just got stuck in a project
that needed 200% of my time to get it going.

I followed the list only a little bit, but from what I have seen is that
Dave is doing a great job in tracking all issues down to the real cause.
I had a look at his last patch and after review, I agree that this is a
possible solution. I only have two nitpicks about the coding style. So
in del_conn the struct device declaration should be made after the
struct hci_conn assignment from the container and I would put an extra
empty line before the devel_del, put_device block. Nitpicks only.
Right now I can't think of any side effects by this patch. Actually I
only see an improvement with this patch. So please take it directly and
starting with next week, I gonna make sure that they are handled again
properly by me.
Regards
Marcel
