I think the user info is not critical: according to the GPL, you must 
tag your changes with date+name. By making a patch, you have agreed to 
the GPL terms, which means you have agreed that your name will be used 
together with the change.
I think the copyright laws require that, too.
But the GPL doesn't mandate a changelog...

For example.
Or a sentence in the Licensing file, or whatever.("If you want to 
contribute to the development at www.kernel.org, then you must agree to 
the following conditions: You name will be used, your commit text will 
be used, your mail address will be published etc." No GPL conflict, you
are free to fork)
I agree with Ingo that there is the danger that without anything, it 
might happen that we'd have to throw away the changelogs [or that 
express permission for all existing entries will be needed, which is 
more or less equivalent]
