I'm running some Dell 1750s with a moderately customized 2.4.20 kernel,  
it has a couple of newer drivers but it's fairly standard.   I have 3 
identical systems that are turning up ext3 corruption fairly regularly.  
They are using the MPT/53c1030 SCSI.  2 of the 3 reported log corruption 
on a boot and mounted the root filesystem in read only.  The other is 
spitting
Dec  9 19:59:58 localhost Unexpected dirty buffer encountered at 
do_get_write_access:616 (08:02 blocknr 0)
 From time to time, I haven't rebooted it yet.
thanks,
Ian
