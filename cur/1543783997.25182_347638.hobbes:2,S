No, it is the same point as in the parent process - just the fork()
call. In fact the fork() returns twice - once within the parent process
(returning as result the pid of the child) and once within the child
(returning 0) [ and we ignore the error case for simplicity ].
Basically you are not forced to do a if() or switch() on the return
value(s) of fork()
----  snip  ----
printf("1. fork() in process %d returned %d\n", getpid(), fork());
printf("2. fork() in process %d returned %d\n", getpid(), fork());
printf("3. fork() in process %d returned %d\n", getpid(), fork());
printf("4. fork() in process %d returned %d\n", getpid(), fork());
printf("5. fork() in process %d returned %d\n", getpid(), fork());
----  snip  ----
Put this in a main() function and try it out.

The kernel doesn't know (or care) about the C code (e.g. if(), ...) in
your application.
The "pointer" (if you want to call it) is the normal instruction pointer
(or what else it is called on your CPU).
