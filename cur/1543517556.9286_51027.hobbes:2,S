First, thank you for your reply ! I felt a little bit lonely...

It seems they don't 'sync', as when I did one manually, before running 'update',
it took so long time I think everything was in memory. And when a crash occured,
my customer lost a whole day of everything (database, files with samba, inodes ...)

Can I check it another way ? I use a modem to connect to the server, so I
suspect <shift-scrollock> won't do it through the phone line :-)
However, what should I check for ?
Do you have pointers on memory testers programs ? However, I don't beleave
this option as I got corruption on a few different servers.

No, I don't use raw devices, just plain files.

True for the kernels, but both servers use amiraid driver.

Nothing in the logs. But if something goes wrong within the driver/firmware, I
think anything can happen.
As doing tests, we cannot afford such beast we sell to our customer...
Worse than that, I've been through Oracle log file, and found the file was
scrambled with pieces of an include file of the kernel. So there *is* memory/disk
corruption, and Oracle is not the only culprit :-(
My sysadmin life is becoming a nightmare, and my collegues are starting to
say that Linux is not so stable. Too bad :-<
