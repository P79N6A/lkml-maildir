I'm primarily fixing ide-cs but the same fix equally applies to any
CompactFlash interface directly accessed as an ide device.

Initially I'd have blamed udev but its actually doing exactly the right
thing in this case and is definitely not at fault. (I've described this
in detail in the past if you want more information.)

These both generally use ide-cs and the patch was written with this in
mind. 
There are a small number of broken adaptors which have been discussed
and the known ones are already worked around.

USB devices have secondary controllers between the card and the USB bus.
The ide interface is not exposed to the system and they're handled by a
totally different interface and driver (sd = scsidisk). This patch
doesn't change anything to do with that and their behaviour is correct.
