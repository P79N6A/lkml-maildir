Maybe you can make use of the same driver that I'd like to use:
- a processes opens the driver device file, and passes the FD to
  another "daemon" process (a child or whatever)
- one process mmap(2)s the FD and does reads and writes to the VMA
- the "daemon" does an ioctl(2) waiting for page fault events, and
  proceeds to read(2)/write(2) to satisfy the page faults
- the driver passes page fault and free memory request events to the
  daemon.
This allows you to set up a user-space virtual memory system. This is
useful for me, it may be useful for you.
All I need to do is find a victim to volunteer to write this ;-)
