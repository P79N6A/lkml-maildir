You need to set your struct device's dma_mask appropriately:
        u64 limit = BLK_BOUNCE_HIGH;
        if (host->dev->dma_mask && *host->dev->dma_mask)
                limit = *host->dev->dma_mask;
        blk_queue_bounce_limit(mq->queue, limit);
Hence, if dma_mask is a NULL pointer or zero, highmem will be bounced.
Neither PNP nor your platform device sets dma_mask, so highmem will
always be bounced in the case of wbsd - which from what you write above
is what you require anyway.
Note: The host can't reach the queue itself because the queues are
created dynamically - it doesn't know when the queue is created or
destroyed or which request comes from which queue.  I'd also guess that
randomly changing the bounce limit will probably end up with a random
selection of requests which have been bounced and those which haven't
hitting the driver.
