Actually is there any chance you could just provide ->compat_ioctl handlers
in the drivers?  All these ioctls are specific to drivers, and it sounds like
a rather bad idea to pollute the global has table with them.  This is also
a good chance to switch the drivers to drop BKL usage in the ioctl path and
use the same handler for ->unlocked_ioctl and ->compat_ioctl.
