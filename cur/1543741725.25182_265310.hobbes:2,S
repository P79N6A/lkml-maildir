I would tend to be very suspicious of DMA not being restored correctly 
because on some systems, prior to or during suspend, DMA may be shutdown 
to conserve power.  There are changes afloat that touch suspend/resume, 
and there have been historical problems with DMA not being restored 
properly after wakeup on some laptops.
Although this may be another shot in the dark, it might rule out the DMA 
problem:  try cat /proc/ide/yourchipset before and after suspend and 
note any changes.  Failing that, use hdparm to turn off DMA before 
suspend and see if the performance suffers to the same degree as after 
wakeup.
