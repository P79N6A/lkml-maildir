that's probably true.
afaict, this powerpc platform <--> RTC class code glue is totally unnecessary; RTC class sets things up fine on 83xx based boards that have rtc chips supported in RTC class (e.g., the ITX).  I'm referring to the third bullet point here:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=116387226902131&w=2
For the MDS boards, which use the ds1374, I'd rather fix the problem properly and add a ds1374 driver to the RTC class.  While Scott Wood (cc'd) has already done the port, I believe his patches are pending some patches by David Brownell.
