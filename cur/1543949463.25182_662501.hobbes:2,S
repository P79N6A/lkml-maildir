Hi Pekka,
thanks for the patch. I however think that HID code is really a wrong 
place to to this, we really want to do this in USB core instead, as that 
it where it belongs.
Why do you think that adding a new quirk for this device to 
usb/core/quirks.c and then checking for it in usb_parse_endpoint() is not 
feasible?
Thanks,
