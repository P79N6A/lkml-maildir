I fully agree that we shouldn't put firmware versioning into the kernel
drivers. The pattern you give to request_firmware() can be mapped to any
file on the file system. And you also have the link to the device object
and I prefer you export a sysfs file for the version so that the helper
application loading the firmware can pick the right file.
