UMSDOS is broken in 2.4 in few places.
You can try to change link sequence by placing
  umsdos.o
before
  msdos.o
in fs/Makefile.
Then you'll get UMSDOS being registered, and possibly an oops
As I remember, the pseudo-root feature doesn't work 
(Certainly it did not work in test7 and I did not notice any patch for
it since that time)
Seems that it is unmaintained at the moment...
