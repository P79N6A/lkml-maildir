What happens with the (sick) case of spaces in directory names?
Also is it really nicely defined that there is no way to put a space
in an option in any of the filesystems?   I suppose someone
particularly sick could have a device node in a directory with a space
in it.  It would be nice if new formats for this are being defined
to make it cover everything.
