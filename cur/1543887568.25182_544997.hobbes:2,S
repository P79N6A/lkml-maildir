oh crap, sorry.  Oh well.
Please test 2.6.22-rc1-mm1 which has all the fixes and is a damn fine
kernel.  It's at
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.22-rc1/2.6.22-rc1-mm1/
The core patch is at 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.22-rc1/2.6.22-rc1-mm1/2.6.22-rc1-mm1.gz,
 and it's against 2.6.22-rc1.
Thanks.
