Hello,
Apologies for the format of the quoted message, I don't like my mailer
either.
Update:
A couple trials indicated that there is even more weirdness going on here
than I previously thought. Firstly, it does not appear to be a problem
restoring when you are in X, just at the console. Secondly, the results are
not always the same but generally the same symptoms appear in some fasion.
Thirdly, switching virtual consoles (which still works when the keyboard is
muffed up) appears to fix the problems.
This morning when I restored my machine, it appeared initially as if my
keyboard had be somehow remapped. Keys were not returning what they should
have. The enter key, for instance, worked. But several of the home row keys
either did nothing or beeped. I hit the 'f' key and I was loogged out of
the shell. (What kind of escape sequence does *that*?)
I know next to nothing about Linux's keyboard implementation. But it
appears as if the APM BIOS is stepping on some data structure that handles
keyboard controls, maybe the keyboard buffer itself. (Is there a real
hardware buffer or is that a feature that is only relevant when programming
DOS applications?) But whatever it is, Linux apparantly already knows how
to fix the problem when it changes consoles so *maybe* it could be fixed by
doing that immediately aftert an APM restore is detected. Or, I could be
off-base.
Thanks for your support, I know that this is a non-critical item. If
someone has a suggested fix, I'd be happy to throw it into a kernel and
test it.

Subject:  ISSUE: Keyboard ScrollLock on after APM suspend/restore
Hello,
I'm going to follow the template...
Keyboard NumLock on after APM suspend/restore
On my laptop, when I restore the machine from a suspended state, it usually
comes up with 1) the screen cleared (but apparantly this is caused by
something that the kernel knows about as it is smart enough to put the
prompt at the top of the screen) and 2) the scroll lock has been turned on.
I have been unable to determine why this is so but I suspect that it may be
a problem with either Power Management and/or the keyboard driver. This
does not happen all of the time but fairly often. Also, the screen clear
and the scroll-lock problem may be separate issues as sometimes I get the
scroll-lock without the screen clear. (It is possible that a particular
garbage string is being sent through the keyboard after a restore that just
happens to do these things through an escape sequence, etc.)

My laptop is a Compaq Armada 1598DMT with APM version 1.2. My keyboard
includes "Compaq Programmable Keys" (which appear to just be able to
be programmed with scancodes, but I have not yet determined a way to do
that under Linux.) but is otherwise as standard as they get on laptops.
