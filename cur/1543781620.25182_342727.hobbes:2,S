IA64 arranges instructions in word size bundles in order to optimize 
instruction fetch. Current GCC versions cannot properly optimize for 
the parallelism capabilities of the Itanium processor and thus many 
slots are filled with nop. Hopefully that will become better in gcc 4.X.
Itanium processors are the fastest 64bit processors at any given clock 
frequency. The earlier generations of processors do not even have the 
instruction set that would enable the processor to do more parallel 
processing. =-)
Please do not make such inflammatory statements on the 
ia64 list.
