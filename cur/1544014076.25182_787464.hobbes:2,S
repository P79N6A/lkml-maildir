The tasklet won't detect any errors unless the DMA controller flags it,
so (7) must happen before (8). That does not necessarily mean that the
interrupts from (6) and (7) get handled before (8), but I don't think
it matters because dwc_handle_error() calls dwc_scan_descriptors(),
which will remove desc B from the active list if it is finished. And it
must be finished if desc C has failed, so the failed descriptor will
always be at the head of the queue after dwc_scan_descriptors() returns.
