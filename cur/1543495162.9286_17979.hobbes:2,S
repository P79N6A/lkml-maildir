This reminds me a strange uucp problem that I see about once a
mounth..three months in 2.0.3x. Sometimes the uucp destination address
is overwitten with garbage, mostly ^@'s but also ^H and other symbols.
The total length of the garbage is about the same.
The problem persists for a uucp session (actually it corrupts the
session) or sometimes repeats 2 or 3 times and then disappears.
Serial ports at 115K (2 builtin + 4 on expansion cards, all 16550A-s
with own irqs). Taylor uucp as comes with RH 4.2. I mostly suspect
uucp but this looks similar...
