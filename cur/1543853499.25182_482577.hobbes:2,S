ia64 and x86_64 are different!
X86_64 shares acpi-cpufreq.c in arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq. So, that
is the file that can be causing problems here.

Yes. Patch from Mattia is indeed required for acpi-cpufreq. 
Mattia: Can you please send the patch towards Andrew (With signed off
etc) for inclusion.
Reuben: Can you please enable CPU_FREQ_DEBUG in your config and boot
with "cpufreq.debug=7" boot parameter and send me the log. That will
give some more debug information that should help to root cause this
faster.
Thanks,
Venki
