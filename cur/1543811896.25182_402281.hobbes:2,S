Solar Designer's Openwall Linux patch contains code for these types of
restrictions (at least since 2.2 if not earlier).  Idea was stolen and
made into an LSM smth like 4 or 5 years ago.  Neither of these have made
it upstream.  Attempts have also been made to codify such restrictions
in SELinux policy.  Polyinstantiation and per-process namespaces can be
done effectively with code that's now in mainline, and can mitigate much
of this risk.
