Reply ALL also results in 2 mails being sent instead of one   but of course this is usually not a problem since one is going direct and the other is going through vger, but still... it's kind of wasteful to
resources and i dont see any harm in Reply-to being sent in the header.  Proftpd's mailing list seems to work fine with it. Is your position against it just due to client incompatibility?
