The device is listed in the DSDT but the functions are empty. E.g. _SRS:
Method (_SRS, 1, NotSerialized)
{
}
_PRS and _CRS at least returns the proper resources that should be used.
PNPBIOS cannot be compiled in. This is a x86_64 machine and PNPBIOS is 
dependent on ISA. Are there any user-space tools that can do the same 
thing? Just to do some testing.
