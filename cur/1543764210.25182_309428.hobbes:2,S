I'll volunteer. As I said, i think it's worth the time and trouble. But 
i can't do it on my own,
at least i need some backup from thee development community around 
here. You telling
me what's up, for one. I found one mail by Greg KH spelling out some of 
the problems, but you
suggest there's more to worry about.
Problem is, i'll be spending 5 weeks prety much scattered around 
europe, starting next friday and have
no idea on my online-ness yet. As it is, my trusty mac is my only 
digital companion, and my linux-box is in
storage for the time being.
So don't expect any results before May 17. But hey... Somebody has to 
do it. Just don't be surprised if the
folks at gcc do not agree with you "a prima vista". They may have a 
different idea on what exactly constitutes
a bug.
Upside is, i'll be taking my Mac anyway, so at least i'll have the 
sources handy. I'll start downloading tonight, so if you have data, 
please, lets have it.
Nevertheless, the points made in previous posts stand.
Regards,
Renate Meijer.
