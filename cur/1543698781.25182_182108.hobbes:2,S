Hi all,
I get
"kernel panic: scsi_free: Bad offset
In interrupt handler: not syncing"
and a deadlock with a 2.4.23 kernel on a SMP (Dual Pentium II) machine.
I'm using a BusLogic card and the only communication on the SCSI bus is
to a CD jukebox with one CD mounted (crash observed with many, too, but
X was running at the time so I don't know if the message was different).
About thirty seconds before crashing the SCSI bus attemted a reset
(apparently successfully, though no more data flow was observed).  During
this reset the system was utterly unresponsive for two seconds before
resuming seemingly normal operations - this same two second lag is
observed at module load (BusLogic) time.
What more information would be useful to fixing this problem?
Thanks.
