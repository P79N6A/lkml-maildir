Ingo,
Donald wrote just about all the Linux netdrivers, but he
now concentrates upon the drivers which he maintains at
http://www.scyld.com
.  Other people try to help out with the
drivers which come from kernel.org.
This particular problem does still occur occasionally.
It's way too infrequent to pin down.  It can certainly
be caused by a very high collision rate on a hubbed LAN.
If that were the only cause I would take all the diagnostics
out, because that's simply ethernet.
Other possible causes are lost interrupts in the kernel
or hardware, cabling problems, power supply problems or,
indeed, a driver bug.
If you are able to reproduce this then I'd be very interested
in working with you on it.  First step is to read the final
section of Documentation/networking/vortex.txt, then send
me a long email.
Thanks.
