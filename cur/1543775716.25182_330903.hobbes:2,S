IIRC, you don't have to do anything to wake up the drive after a
STANDBYNOW command, if you want to be on the safe side you just issue an
IDLEIMMEDIATE. So your code will look something like:
int drive_standby(int fd)
{
        char foo[4] = { 0xe0, 0, 0, 0 };
        return ioctl(fd, HDIO_DRIVE_CMD, &foo);
}
int drive_wakeup(int fd)
{
        char foo[4] = { 0xe1, 0, 0, 0 };
        return ioctl(fd, HDIO_DRIVE_CMD, &foo);
}
