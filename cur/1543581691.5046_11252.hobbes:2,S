Yup,
those who fail to learn from TCP are doomed to re-invent it, badly, at the
wrong level <GRIN>.
Seriously, the console subsystem on the Sequent (now IBM) NUMA-Q systems
originally used UDP. It wound up as a serious mess. We changed to TCP.
I'll admit that the NUMA-Q console subsystem does more than what is being
proposed here currently, but it's likely to grow.
In general UDP is only appropriate if you *can* afford to drop data.
Did RDP ever get anywhere ?

Tim
