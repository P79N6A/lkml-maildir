That's something which should be done for any partitioning method imho.
I have heard of some situations where, on x86 machines, the DOS and
ext2 filesystems overlapped, but somehow managed to keep working for
a considerable period of time.  Then when it all goes wrong, the user
blamed Linux for screwing their DOS/Windows partition.
This might be an acceptable way out of this problem.

If the checksum seems to be correct and you mis-parse an x86 bios
partition table as powertec, chances are that you'll have a non-zero
size word somewhere in that sector.

Unfortunately they don't default to zero.
