How about a run-time mechanism for detecting illegal instructions and
modifying them into harmless NOP sequences?
Ie. on loading of a binary could quickly scan it for illegal sequences and
overwrite with NOPs, then execute it. Of course, this doesn't cater for
things that does J-I-T compilation & execution though.
