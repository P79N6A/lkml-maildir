I believe Linus mentioned this before, but I'll mention it anyway; when
sharing interrupts, remember to set them to be level triggered, not edge
triggered, otherwise you may get lost interrupts.
This may be one of the main causes for shared interrupt problems, since
it's not something people are likely to know about.
