I can't get a SIGSEGV on any native i386 kernel, not even when
running on AMD64.  It only happens on native x86_64 kernels.
Looking at the AMD instruction manual, the pseudo-code for 'enter'
ends with:
RSP.s = RSP - temp_ALLOC_SPACE // Leave "temp_ALLOC_SPACE" free bytes on
                               // the stack
WRITE_MEM.v [SS:RSP.s] = temp_unused // ENTER finishes with a memory write
                                     // check on the final stack pointer,
                                     // but no write actually occurs.
RBP.v = temp_RBP
EXIT
And the Intel manual says:
IF 64-Bit Mode (StackSize = 64)
THEN
        RBP = FrameTemp;
        RSP = RSP - Size;
ELSE IF StackSize = 32
THEN
        EBP = FrameTemp;
        ESP = ESP - Size;
ELSE (* StackSize = 16 *)
        BP = FrameTemp;
        SP = SP - Size;
FI;
END;
Intel says nothing about a write check.  Is that a mistake in the manual
or is that something only AMD64 does, and then only in long mode?
