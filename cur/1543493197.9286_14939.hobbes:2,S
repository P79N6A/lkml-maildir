   Which only means that "more" should have inheritable set equal to
   zero. I _still_ do not see why setting inheritable set should be
   privileged operation.
If it's not a privileged operation, then the attacker can change the
inheritable set of "more" first....
   Ok, given example with "more"... I do not think inheritable set of
   "more" set to NULL would help: even if it was that way, shell executed
   from more would have uid == 0 and no privileges. But what user owns
   /etc/passwd? uid == 0. And I've got a shell with... uid == 0. So I do
   not need any privilege (it is owned by same uid!) to edit /etc/passwd
   and you are screwed; anyway. I could this be solved in "pure
   capabilities" system, but I do not see how you want to fit protection
   against "more" attack and still be unix.
You can do full POSIX capabilities and still be Unix; and the way you
solve this problem using model outlined by the POSIX capabilities draft
is that /usr/ucb/Mail would no longer be setuid root, so "more" would not
be running with uid 0, and neither would the shell executing from more.
/usr/ucb/Mail would instead have a capability which allowed it to
override filesystem discretionary access controls, or whatever other
capabilities/privileges it needed.  But it would not need to be setuid
root.
