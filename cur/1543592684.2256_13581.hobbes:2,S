Well, they probably did. Its just that the kernel released unused swap
cache pages (thus releasing swap space) "more often".
Just to confirm this is what happening in your case:  Can you please try
2.4.4-ac5 and see if the _swap usage_ is still as badly?
This kernel contains a workaround to make the VM release unused swap cache
pages more often. (note: newer 2.4.4-ac do not contain the patch because
it could cause locks under some cases. Specially swap to files)
Back to the interactivity issue, I suppose you've "felt" bad interactivity
with 2.4.* kernels, right ?
I am asking that because I do not believe this swap usage issue is the
main reason for the problem.
