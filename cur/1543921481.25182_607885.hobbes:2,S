I don't understand why should we re-initialize the completion too,
but see below.

Why?

No, because we decrement the ->done count only once, but there is no
guarantee that ->done == 1 when we get CPU after wakeup. Another reader
can do lock_cpu_hotplug/unlock_cpu_hotplug in between, so we have a race.
But I disagree with "Yet once a completion is completed, it needs to be
re-initialized to be reused: it's "complete" and wait_for_completion
will return immediately thereafter".
Rusty, could you please clarify?
Side note, we don't block the new readers while cpu_hotplug_begin() waits
for the completion. I don't think this is a problem, but perhaps it makes
sense to document the possible livelock.
Oleg.
