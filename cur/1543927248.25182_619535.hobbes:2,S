I guess the problem is that we converted a macro to a function, where the
macro did no type checking. Now we need to pick between integers and
pointers. Some places uses intergers in wrmsrl and some use pointers. So
changing this to a typechecking protocol is not going to be nice.
Looking at the current code now, we have this:
====
	checking_wrmsrl(MSR_IA32_SYSENTER_CS, (u64)__KERNEL_CS);
	checking_wrmsrl(MSR_IA32_SYSENTER_ESP, 0ULL);
	checking_wrmsrl(MSR_IA32_SYSENTER_EIP, (u64)ia32_sysenter_target);
	wrmsrl(MSR_CSTAR, ia32_cstar_target);
====
A typecast is already used in that same area.
