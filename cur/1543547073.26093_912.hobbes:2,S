Kind of what I figured, too bad Linux 2.4 PNP is akin to Plug'N Pray (trademark MS ;)).
It seems as though 2.4 is taking a step backwards since the same system/bios setup
worked just fine on 2.2 with userland PNP utilities.  Making PNP work for more
cases would sure be nice.
Do you know of anyone actively working to make the above kernel adjustments?
Can it be done relatively easily?
