The "message" is actually mapped to an the interrupt vector by the core
generic interrupt handling code in the kernel.
A "GSI" (Generic Sys Interrupt?) is associated with each entry in
the MSI-X table. Driver then calls request_irq() to bind an interrupt
handler to each GSI. So the driver never directly sees the "message".
