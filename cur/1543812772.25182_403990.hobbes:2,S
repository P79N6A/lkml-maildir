If it is making the machine unusable then it is a bug rather than
just poor behaviour, and definitely a regression.
I think this is very good grounds to get into 2.6.16, even if it
does mean pushing the release back.
The other thing that is typically done for regressions like these
close to release time is to revert the offending changes. I figure
that in this case, such an option is probably _more_ risky.
