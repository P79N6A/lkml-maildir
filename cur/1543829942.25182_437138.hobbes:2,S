Thanks Eric, that helps me understand. Section 8.2.2 of the open cciss
spec supports a reset message. Target 0x00 is the controller. We could
add this to the init routine to ensure the board is made sane again but
this would drastically increase init time under normal circumstances.
And I suspect this is a hard reset, also. Not sure if that would
negatively impact kdump. If there were some condition we could test
against and perform the reset when that condition is met it would not
impact 99.9% of users.
Thoughts, comments, flames?
