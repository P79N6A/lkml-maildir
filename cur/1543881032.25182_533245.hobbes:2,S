i'm sorry, but i can't test it, i don't have the device. initially the
patch was a kernel janitorial with the idea to replace the assignation
to SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED by DEFINE_SPINLOCK. when i sent the first patch
to the kj list someone pointed me to the spinlock on stack. 
i also wondered about the use of the spinlock after aquiring the big
kernel lock, i agree that it's probable the safest to remove the
spinlockaltogether. below you find a patch that does this.
thanks for your comments

remove spinlock hysdn_lock (declared on the stack) from HYSDN
driver. the code region is already protected by the big kernel lock.
