Subject: [PATCH 4/4] ACPI C-States: dyn-ticks tweaks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/12/31/47

If dyn-ticks is enabled, we can and should try to be smart when
deciding which C-State to enter.
If we're likely not to wake up soon, we can "kick back" to the high C-State
the system was in before bus mastering activity was present.
If we slept for a long period of time last time, and we're scheduled to do
so again, we can enter a higher (or even the next higher) C-State.
(fastpath, super-fastpath promotion).
If bus mastering activity was detected this jiffy, schedule an extra
early wakeup: most likely there's something to handle then anyways, and
we hope this bus mastering activity will end soon, allowing us to utilize
high C-States afterwards.
