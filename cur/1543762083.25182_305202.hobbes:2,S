It shouldn't be.
In the case that pud is folded, free_pud_range will only call into
free_pmd_range once, and that function will loop over the required
range of the pud (ie. the pmd). If it then also falls through to
pud_clear in that function, it will also fall through to pgd_clear
in free_pud_range. So it doesn't _really_ matter which one does the
actual clearing in that case.
I think David's on the right track - I think there's something a
bit wrong at the top. In my reply to Andrew in this thread I
posted a patch which may at least get things working...
