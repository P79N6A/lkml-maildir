  Oops, sorry, I spoke to soon. After thinking more about it, I think we
cannot clear the dirty bit (at least not jbddirty) in all cases and in
fact moving cancel_dirty_page() after do_invalidatepage() call only
hides the real problem.
  Let's recap what JBD/ext3 code requires in case of truncation.  A
life-cycle of a journaled buffer looks as follows: When we want to write
some data to it, it gets attached to the running transaction. When the
transaction is committing, the buffer is written to the journal.
Sometime later, the buffer is written to it's final place in the
filesystem - this is called checkpoint - and can be released.
  Now suppose a write to the buffer happens in one transaction and you
truncate the buffer in the next one. You cannot just free the buffer
immediately - it can for example happen, that the transaction in which
the write happened hasn't committed yet. So we just leave the dirty
buffer there and it should be cleaned up later when the committing
transaction writes the data where it needs...
  The problem is that when the commit code writes the buffer, it
eventually calls try_to_free_buffers() but as Nick pointed out,
->mapping is set to NULL by that time so we don't even call
cancel_dirty_page() and so the number of dirty pages is not properly
decreased. Of course, we could decrease the number of dirty pages after
we return from do_invalidatepage when clearing ->mapping but that would
make dirty accounting imprecise - we really still have those dirty data
which need writeout. But it's probably the best workaround I can
currently think of.
