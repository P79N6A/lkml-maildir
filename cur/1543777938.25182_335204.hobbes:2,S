If these are reasonable numbers, is there any methods available to improve the 
responsiveness of X? I find I can't get smooth drawing, both scrolling text 
(in konsole) and dragging windows around, yields "skips" where the drawing 
isn't fluid. 
Secondly, what are the suggested settings for preempt in the ck kernel 
configuration?
Thanks for your time.
