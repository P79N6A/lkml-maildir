Hello,
What is the status for nforce3 support in 2.4 and 2.6? Ive found a patch from 
google dating all the way back in nov 2003, but it doesnt seem like its been 
applied. FYR here is the google search link:

+linux&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&selm=JSef.Wi.19%40gated-at.bofh.it&rnum=1
When trying the agpgart and nvidia_agp module on my nforce3 system, I get this 
message in dmesg:
agpgart: Detected an NVIDIA nForce/nForce2 chipset, but could not find the 
secondary devices.
Right now Im using 2.6.2-rc2-mm2, but 2.4.24 also give the same message. What 
is this "secondary devices" it cant find? Is this related to an unsupported 
AGP card? (Im using an Creative ATI Radeon 9200SE, and I cant enable direct 
rendering - only been able to use X version 4.3.99.902 and its built-in 
driver.)
I'll be happy to provide DeviceIDs and test patches, if someone needs it.
Thank you.
