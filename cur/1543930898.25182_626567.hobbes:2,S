I missed the early part of this thread,
but here is a data point that may or may not be useful.
I have an ASUS mobo here with an onboard JM363 SATA/PATA controller
(verified by looking at the actual chip).
It works fine when in AHCI mode with a PATA ATAPI ZIP100 drive
all by itself.  No other configurations tested.
This is with kernel 2.6.24-rc4-git?.
Cheers
