Actually it is something compatible from ELSA. 
I tried your suggestions and it didn't work. On your machines, does the card
get an interrupt from the bios during init?
My Bios (PCI v2.1) only prints CardBus Adapter, no IRQ is assigned.
I already tried different slots. I guess it's a bios problem but i'm interested
to make it work without the help of the bios. At least the bios is only
a pice of software...

Did that. Interesting messages during kernel boot:
PCI->APIC IRQ transform: (B1,I0,P0) -> 16
  got res[20000000:20000fff] for resource 0 of Texas Instruments PCI1410 \
PCcard Cardbus Controller
Linux Kernel Card Services 3.1.22
  options:  [pci] [cardbus]
PCI: Enabling device 00:13.0 (0000 -> 0002)
PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 00:13.0. Probably buggy MP 
table.
Isn't it possible to assign an interrupt to INT A of this device ? IOW, fix 
what
is considered a buggy MP table ?
Yenta IRQ list 0000, PCI irq0
Socket status: 10000047
