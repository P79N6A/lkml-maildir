It just happened again. It's reproducibly triggered, at least on this
system, by the ocaml-3.09.02 configure script running over NFS (probably
NFS over UDP is necessary as well).
In theory I could now use this to minimise the problem, but the sheer
number of reboots this is likely to need is dissuading me: I'll put it
off until someone actually wants such a minimal crash case :)
