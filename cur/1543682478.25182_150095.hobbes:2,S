Subject: INIT:   USB FATAL in for Kernel 2.5.xx and 2.6.xx in Redhat v9.0  PLease Read.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

After installing RH 9.0 and installing rawhide's
mkinitrd and moduitls rpm's as well as non kernel
updates from "
http://people.redhat.com/arjanv/2.5/",
 
I still have a problem with USB.
Note:  after updating the mkinitrd and modutils, the
generate-modprobe.conf must automatically run and did
run  because it was created in /etc/modprobe.conf.  I
did not have to generate it manually.
I have 2.4.20-8, 2.4.20-18.9 boot jsut fine with the
updated mkinitrd and modutils but I still have
problems with kernel 2.5.75-mm1 and 2.6.0-test1-mm2.
I have also attached my modules.conf and modprobe,conf
and my rc.sysinit, so maybe you can tell me what I
need to do to fix this
issue for 2.5.xx and 2.6.xx kernels.
One thing I knwo for sure is that in 2.5.xx and 2.6.xx
kernels there is no usb-uhci.o driver.  I believe they
changes the name and I wonder if this is why I am
having problems booting the 2.5.xx and 2.6.xx serieis
kernels?
