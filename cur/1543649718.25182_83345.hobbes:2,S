Resource Management code in phprm.h works fine for both ACPI based platforms
and non-ACPI platforms (smbios, BIOS $HRT, pcibios_pci_irq_routing...) doing
php enumeration, configuration, resource allocation, etc. Only phprm_acpi.c
is included in this release for size matters.
intcphp driver is free from controller type, IA32/IPF, ACPI/non-ACPI and
depending on kernel configuration, it can bind to either ACPI PHPRM or
non-ACPI PHPRM.
PCI resource handling code - that does add/delete/sort/combine, etc on
pci_resource - has nothing to do with ACPI or non-ACPI so it should be
common across cpqphp, ibmphp, acpiphp and intcphp. They are duplicated and
varied due to mother structures differences.
