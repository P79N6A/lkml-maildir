Hello,
I have installed the RH 6.0 and have updated the kernel to 2.2.7-ac1.
I am testing NFS with iozone.
The NFS server is doing rather well with one client (6,8Mo/s with a
2.2.7-ac1 Linux client, 7,3 Mo/s with a FreeBSD client for writing,
5,0 Mo/s during reading for Linux, 4,8 Mo/s for FreeBSD).
Unfortunately, when I run both clients at the same time, reading
performance drops drastically : 700 Ko/s each. During rereading,
the load of the server climbs between 3 and 4.
When I run two iozones locally on the server, I get 3,5 Mo/s on each
iozone (ie, the global rate is  around 7 Mo/s, which is consistent).
So, to summary :
1)	1 NFS client : ~ 7 Mo/s writing, 5 Mo/s reading
2)	2 NFS clients: ~ 7 Mo/s writing, 1,5 Mo/s reading (cumulated)
3)	1 local client : ~ 9 Mo/s writing,  7 Mo/s reading
4)	2 local clients : ~ 9 Mo/s writing,  7 Mo/s reading. (cumulated)
Where can the problem (1,5 Mo/s) be ?
A +,
