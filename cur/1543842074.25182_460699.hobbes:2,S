Is that Intel? They normally don't have problems with free drivers.

The code would certainly need a lot of cleanup and split up etc.
(Andrew has a nice document on that somewhere, it's called "the perfect 
patch")
What I could see is that if you turn that into generic "memory mirror" 
VM code and submit the patches to do that together with some simple
that uses it. I suppose other people could then use it too and it might
end up as a nice generic facility in Linux code.
Then when that generic subsystem is in your hardware specific drivers could 
possibly use it, although it would be definitely strongly prefered if those
were GPL too.
