? So the idea is to merge inferior code and "hope users won't notice"?
Users  might not notice that half their memory is gone, but they *will* 
notice that their system is dog slow when it resumes because all their 
caches are gone and a most of their stuff is swapped out.
Non-responsive system on resume is one of the main reasons that swsusp2 
is much better than swsusp1, and yes, users *do* notice (I was one of 
them, as I pointed out a while back). Yes, 50% is better than nothing, 
but it's still a pretty poor show.
Seen from the perspective of a user, the situation is simple: suspend2 
works, it's fast, and it's rock-solid. Just use it.
Regards,
Lorenzo
P.S. Don't "show me the code" me. I can't write the code. :-) But based 
on what I see of how well suspend2 works, I think Nigel can...
