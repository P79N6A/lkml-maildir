More Info.  If any of your file names contain the following hex values
in ASCII and the server has either the OS2, LONG, or NFS namespaces
installed on the volume, these characters will be "stripped" and/or
converted by other Novell clients and the namespace modules (LONG.NAM
(4x/5x), NFS.NAM, OS2.NAM (3x)).  Also, any characters above 127 could
get garbaged by the server if you are running a US version of NetWare. 
Any of the international versions, except Japanese, allow characters to
be stored in "pass through" mode where the namespace modules do not
filter or strip out characters.  If you can get a copy of the French
NetWare version, you may see this problem go away.
=(x3D) %(x25) #(x23) +(x2B)
'(x27) [(x5B) ](x5D) ;(x3B)
,(x2C) "(x22) <space>(x20)
