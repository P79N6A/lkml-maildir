That's an application problem.  For kernel.org, you may well have
multi-megabyte files which are created gradually over quite some
time as ftp uploads take place: do you expect the filesystem to be
able to tell the difference between a successful and an unsuccessful
upload and delete the file if it went wrong?  
In this sort of case, you want the application to create a temporary
file, fsync it, and then rename it to its final destination if you 
want the consistency of the final file to be guaranteed.
