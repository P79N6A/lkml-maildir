FYI, it wasn't the libraries.  The lxdialog was compiled on the machine that
had the 'problem', but ran fine on another machine.  When I upgraded the
ncurses library/dev package, I never upgraded the rest of ncurses (debian
system).  Upgraded -bin, -term, -base and everything is fine now, I believe
it was -term that caused the problems.
Altho the colors that was there wasn't too bad, should we go for a color
configurator now ?  <g>
