You can't check if it's been handled, yes; but you can certainly check
if you delivered it. I guess Javier wants to exclude the cases where
userspace didn't have any chance to handle it.
Javier: Do you have an idea how common the case "we broadcasted, but
nobody listened so we got a timeout" is? If the usual reason for the
timeout is that firmware was requested before a listener showed up, I'm
not sure whether that check is worth it...
