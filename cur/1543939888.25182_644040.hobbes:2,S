btw., it's quite mysterious how this can lock up. ktime_get() on a hpet 
clocksource does a very straightforward:
 static cycle_t read_hpet(void)
 {
         return (cycle_t)hpet_readl(HPET_COUNTER);
 }
which is a very simple thing:
c0119470 <hpet_readl>:
c0119470:       8b 15 b8 b4 ae c0       mov    0xc0aeb4b8,%edx
c0119476:       55                      push   %ebp
c0119477:       89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp
c0119479:       5d                      pop    %ebp
c011947a:       01 d0                   add    %edx,%eax
c011947c:       8b 00                   mov    (%eax),%eax
c011947e:       c3                      ret
basically just a memory access to an ioremap()-ed area.
hm, perhaps it's due to the xtime lock dependency:
        do {
                seq = read_seqbegin(&xtime_lock);
                getnstimeofday(ts);
                tomono = wall_to_monotonic;
        } while (read_seqretry(&xtime_lock, seq));
perhaps your system somehow generates a printk from within an xtime_lock 
locked section?
