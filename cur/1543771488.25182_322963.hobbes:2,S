It is not insignificant and makes a lot of difference. On the x86-64
version of pmtimer I dropped it completely and so far nobody 
complained.
However I wonder why this new time system is using pmtimer by default
at all. That is very broken because pmtimer is one of the slowest.
I would suggest to duplicate the time source selection I have
in the latest x86-64 (-rc5) time.c, that is optimal for all machines
I know about (except that you might need to add cyclone and a non TSC
fallback for i386)
