I'm not supposed to run linux on i386, ask Bill. Why do I do it then?

If you allocate a block of 2*PAGESIZE-1 bytes, *any* allocation method is
*guaranteed* return at least one complete page. (BTW: The example from the
manpage is wrong since it does only make sure the starting address is on
the page, but not that the end of the protected memory is within the
allocated area. Whom should I contact?)
But even if Vincend makes the next malloc/free/whatever to be fubar,
or if he made the world explode, mprotect is still required to report
an error if the requested action failed. If it doesn't do that for
mprotecting _any_ range, no matter how strange it may be, it is broken.
