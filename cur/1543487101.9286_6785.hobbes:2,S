The README also suggests to first check that your SCSI bus is compliant to
specs. Let me assume you did it. :)

General remark:
---------------
IMO, mixing a JAZ device with a fine Fast-40 Hard disk on the same SCSI
BUS is kind of suicide, since the JAZ devices are known to be crappily 
firmwared.
> Every once and a while, I get something like the following in my log files:
You got 2 SCSI interrupts in the same second (UDC+PAR) that seem to have
occurred for a single cause. This is not impossible if the device
disconnected the BUS and the chip was reading the SCSI BUS, or if the 
disconnect had been too hard. Btw, we get such kinds of error conditions  
with not correctly set SCSI BUS.
I suggest you the following:
1 - Make sure that your SCSI BUS is, at least theorically, correctly
    configured (cables characteristics and quality, terminator positions, 
    etc...). If you aren't sure enough, send me (us)  the description of
    your SCSI BUS (cables length, position of each terminator and
    devices).
2 - If you donnot have either old 810 rev. < 16 or 815 or 825 rev < 16 on 
    your system, give a try with the latest sym53c8xx-1.2a driver that has 
    been recently enhanced for SCSI error recovery. Changes haven't yet 
    been backported to stock ncr53c8xx driver.
3 - Send me the messages printed by the driver at bootup using driver
    verbose level 2. Boot command line : ncr53c8xx=verb:2
4 - Never use lspci command or cat /proc/pci/your_895_device under root 
    account with linux-2.1/2.2 since the reading of config space bytes 128 
    to 256 will just read the whole IO register space of the chip and
    trigger bunches of side effects that have every chance to kill your 
    system.
Let me know.
Gérard.
