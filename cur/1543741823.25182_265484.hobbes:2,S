Allow me to translate that what this means, so everyone clearly knows 
what's going on here:
The complete development history of the Linux kernel is now effectly 
locked into the bk format, you can get a summary of it, but that's it.
The data everyone put into a bk repository is now owned by BM and only if 
you abide to the rules set by BM, do you have the permission to extract 
some of the data again. You can completely forget the idea to one day 
import "your" data into a different SCM system.
bye, Roman
