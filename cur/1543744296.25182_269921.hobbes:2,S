How long is a piece of string? It depends entirely on your workload. On 
a desktop machine just switching applications pushes it to 10,000. 
Basically you end up making it an O(n) calculation by increasing the 
overhead of it (albeit small) proportionately to the context switch load 
which is usually significantly higher than the system load.

Same answer. Depends entirely on the workload and to whether your 
running tasks sleep at all or not (hint - most do). While it will be a 
lower number than the number of context switches, it potentially can be 
as high with just the right sort of threads (think server, network type 
stuff).
