mmm. will take me a little time to digest that.
But we were just discussing here ... wouldn't it be worth moving 
"unlikely" sections of code completely out of line? If they were calls 
to separate functions, all this optimisation stuff could just work at a 
function level, and would be pretty trivial to do?
ie instead of:
if (unlikely(conditon)) {
	do;
	some;
	stuff;
	BUG();
	error();
	oh_dear();
}
we'd have
if (unlikely(conditon)) {
	call_oh_shit();
}
__rarely_called void call_oh_shit()
{
	do;
	some;
	stuff;
	BUG();
	error();
	oh_dear();
}
depends how long they are, I suppose. Moving that out of line would seem 
to make more difference to icache footprint to me than just cacheline 
packing functions.
