Hmmm...
pml4, pgd, pmd, pte  (kernel names)
PML4E, PDPE, PDE, PTE   (AMD hardware names)
It's kind of a mess, isn't it? It was bad enough
with the "pmd" (page middle directory, ugh) being
some random invention and everything being generally
in conflict with real hardware naming. Now you've
come up with a fourth name.
Notice that you've resorted to using a number.
Why not do that for the others too? It would
bring some order to this ever-growing collection
of arbitrary names. Like this:
pd4, pd3, pd2, pd1
