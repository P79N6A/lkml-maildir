Hi,
I am trying to implement a virtual TTY device which relate to a serial
port through some complex protocol, but I have no experience about
it.So can anybody tell me where should I put the operation functions ?
Implement a new tty driver or just put the operation in the
functions(tty_open,tty_read, etc) which in the tty_io.c or something
else(maybe as a line dicipline:)?
In my opinion, to implement the code in the tty_driver will let the code be with the hardware driver together,and its not good I think.
But to implement the code in tty_io.c will let the length of tty_io.c longer and longer...
So is there any suggestion or something like this which had been implemented ?
TIA
