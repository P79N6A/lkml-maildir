Correct - all the vendors face the problem that there are people out
there who want to try and pass crap on using someone elses good name
whether its toothpaste, perfume or software (or in the case of RHEL
software/services/support bundles)
The Fedora mark is thus used to make sure that if you get a Fedora CD, it
actually has -Fedora- on it etc.
