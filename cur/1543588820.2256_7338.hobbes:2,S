:-) Great.
You and Alex are right - I agree that this is a complete moronism.
But, what I should say to the network security, is that AFAIK in the most
of linux distributions the standard daemons (httpd, sendmail) are run as
root! Having multi-user system or not! Why? For only listening to a port
<1024? Is there any elegant solution?
