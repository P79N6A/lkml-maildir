Agreed, it looks like a memleak of a page_count (while mapcount is fine).
I would suggest looking after pages part of pagecache (i.e.
page->mapcount not null) that have a mapcount of 0 and a page_count > 1,
almost all of them should be like that during the memleak, and almost
none should be like that before the memleak.
This seems unrelated to the bug that started the thread that was clearly
a slab shrinking issue and not a pagecache memleak.
Thanks.
