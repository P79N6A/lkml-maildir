I don't think so.  Some quick grepping indicates that _all_
tty drivers currently use the "ttyS" equivalent if !CONFIG_DEVFS.
Instead, it appears that someone broke tty_name().  Here's the
2.2 kernel's version:
char *tty_name(struct tty_struct *tty, char *buf)
{
        if (tty)
                sprintf(buf, "%s%d", tty->driver.name, TTY_NUMBER(tty));
        else
                strcpy(buf, "NULL tty");
        return buf;
}
And that's much more sensible.  The tty has a name associated with
what it is (eg "ttyS") - correlates with major number, probably.
And it has an instance number.
Which is cleaner, IMO, than embedding printf control strings
in the driver name.

Does this look (and work) OK to you?
