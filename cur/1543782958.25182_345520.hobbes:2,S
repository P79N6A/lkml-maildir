The wakeup.S code is missing a small piece of code.
For a  lot of BIOSes you need to set ax to a PCI ID, I have code in my
tree at the moment that does this:
in do_vgapost_lowlevel:
acpi_video_devnum = (pci_dev->bus->number<<8) | (pci_dev->devfn);
and then in the wakeup code
movl video_devnum-wakeup_code, %eax
The code is all in the patch at
http://www.skynet.ie/~airlied/patches/lk/my_pm_diffs
This is just a drop of my current tree from when I was hacking on
suspend/resume at OLS.
Dave.
