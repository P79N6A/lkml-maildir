  The compact flashes appear to PCMCIA as removable IDE drives.
  Unless the PCMCIA-CF adapter is more than just two connectors
  plus a set of wires in between, you should have no problems
  at all.   Either IDE, or IDE_CS driver should do it.
  (The IDE_CS will, of course, need the PCMCIA suite too to
   support removable media.  IDE doesn't support removability.)
  To boot from CF you need support in your boot-rom/flash
  code.  Something which might not be true, unless you write
  it yourself..
