Why do you keep saying "upgraded" to GPLv3?  How is it an improvement to move 
from a small, simple, elegant, and tested implementation to something that's 
more complicated, less elegant, less coherent, totally untested, and full of 
numerous special cases?
Bumping a version number is not in indicator of quality, and spending over 
twice as much text to express the same legal principles is not an 
improvement.  So far, you haven't brought up a single reason to use v3 except 
for a higher version number.  (Not that I'm asking you to.)  You've just 
tried to argue that it isn't WORSE than the existing license.
