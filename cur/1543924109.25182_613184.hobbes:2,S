Yeah:
  ep_81 -> ../../../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/usb2/2-0:1.0/usb_endpoint/usbdev2.1_ep81
just becomes:
  ep_81 -> usb_endpoint/usbdev1.1_ep81
which is nice. The current logic always goes back down to the root of sysfs
and moves forward to the target, which in this case prepends the pointless:
  "../../../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/usb2/2-0:1.0/" to
the target string.
