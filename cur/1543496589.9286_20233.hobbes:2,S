   Running 2.2.7 here, I often run into this problem: my serial ports, though
   detected perfectly by setserial, fail to show interrupts in
   /proc/interrupts. This happens with my soundcard as well, occasionally
   (though right now it does have an interrupt - none for the serials
   though).
This isn't a problem, it's standard behaviour.  /proc/interrupts show
which interrupts are currently active and registered with the kernel.
The serial driver releases the IRQ if there are no ports open using that
IRQ.  This allows the IRQ to be shared by other devices (normally other
serial devices).
