Subject: [PATCH] fix bogus ECHILD return from wait* with zombie group leader
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/12/4/74

Klaus Dittrich observed this bug and posted a test case for it.  This patch
fixes both that failure mode and some others possible.  What Klaus saw was
a false negative (i.e. ECHILD when there was a child) when the group leader
was a zombie but delayed because other children live; in the test program
this happens in a race between the two threads dying on a signal.  The
change to the TASK_TRACED case avoids a potential false positive (blocking,
or WNOHANG returning 0, when there are really no children left), in the
race condition where my_ptrace_child returns zero.
Thanks,
Roland
