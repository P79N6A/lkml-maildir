Hi,
I want to let a nopage mmap handler return a 'struct page' that
refers to a non-physical-memory address (e.g. some device memory).
pfn_valid(x) fails for this address (returning 0) so
pfn_to_page(x) can't be used.
How can I implement this functionality? Must the VM_IO bit be set?
Are there several methods to implement this?
thanks,
y
