The box died, but not due to rmap.  We have a lock ranking
bug:
        do_exit
        ->mmput
          ->exit_mmap                           page_table_lock
            ->removed_shared_vm_struct
              ->lock_vma_mappings               i_shared_lock
versus
        do_truncate
        ->notify_change
          ->inode_setattr
            ->vmtruncate                        i_shared_lock
              ->vmtruncate_list
                ->zap_page_range                page_table_lock
It seems that in 2.5.16, a call to remove_shared_vm_struct() was
added to exit_mmap(), inside mm->page_table_lock.
That ranking conflicts with truncate.
