Subject: [PATCH 00/16] Add InfiniBand userspace verbs (direct userspace access)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Here is a series of patches that adds support for direct userspace access to
InfiniBand hardware -- so-called "userspace verbs."  I believe these patches
are ready to merge, but a final review would be useful.
These patches should incorporate all of the feedback from the discussion when
I posted an earlier version back in April (see
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/4/4/267
 for the start of the thread).  In
particular, memory pinned for use by userspace is accounted for in
current->mm->vm_locked and requests to pin memory are checked against
RLIMIT_MEMLOCK.
Thanks,
  Roland
