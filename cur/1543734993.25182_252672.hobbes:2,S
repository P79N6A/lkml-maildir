Each task has several timers, i.e. time slice, time limit, and possibly itimer 
profile.  Granted only one of these needs to be sent to the timer code, but that 
takes a bit of time, not much, but enough to increase the context switch 
overhead such that a system with a modest amount of context switching will incur 
more timer management overhead than the periodic tick generates.
