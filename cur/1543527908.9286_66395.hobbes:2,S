Now I understood how you protect your sacred area ... seems to me that,
if __va(0x90000) or __va(0x100000) happen to be in your vmalloc'ed
area, you may corrupt the new kernel.
I find it also a bit unfortunate that your code needs to have a fairly
good idea of the memory layout of what it's loading, so even the part
in kernel/sys.c is quite architecture-specific.

Ah, seems that you don't know the secret  nocheck  option yet ;-)
From my notebook's /etc/fstab:
/dev/hda1   /   ext2   noatime,nocheck 1 1
etc.
