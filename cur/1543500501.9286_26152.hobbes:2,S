Not exactly. In fact we need BOTH. Otherwise will be VERY hard to convinience
KDE/GNOME/whatever developers to use such features.

And STILL big part of threads support is in libc, not in kernel. And even more:
there are quite a few user-level threads packages. So when you use thread-based
program (MySQL, for example) you can use user-level version when system does
not have kernel-supported threads package.

I'm really can not see why it's so problematic. You can use file suffix or
prefix ( "\albod" or "*albod" ) to mark albod's... Yes, this is ugly but it
will work.

Secuority is not a big problem here -- you can make a secuirty holes in
user-space solution as well as in kernel solution. Portability is a BIG win.
Without portability it will be VERY hard to convinience application developers
to use such additions. And kernel version is inherently non-portable.
