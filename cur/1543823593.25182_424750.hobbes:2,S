Wiretapping is about listening in on communication. Network cards are the 
means this communication is carried out and see all the traffic somebody 
might want to tap into. This clearly makes it at least theoretically 
possible to use them as a listening device (and it sees all the other 
traffic on its network segment, too).
Additionally its listening on the system bus. Question: Can it tap into 
data addressed to another peripheral (say the hd controller)? If so, then 
only the system RAM is outside its scope.
