Lost forever means? If there are more processes watching some fd 
(external events), they all get their own copy of the events in their own 
private epoll fd. It's not that we "steal" things out of the kernel, is 
not a 1:1 producer/consumer thing (one producer, 1 queue). It's one 
producer, broadcast to all listeners (consumers) thing. The only case 
where it'd matter is in the case of multiple threads sharing the same 
epoll fd.
In general, I'd be more for having the userspace get his own SEGFAULT 
instead of letting it go with broken parameters. If I'm coding userspace, 
and I'm doing something wrong, I like the kernel to let me know, instead 
of trying to fix things for me.
Also, epoll can easily be fixed (add a param to ep_reinject_items() to 
re-inject items in case of error/EFAULT) to leave events in the ready-list 
and let the EFAULT emerge. 
Anyone else has opinions about this?
PS: Next time it'd be great if you Cc: me when posting epoll patches, so 
    you avoid Andrew the job of doing it.
