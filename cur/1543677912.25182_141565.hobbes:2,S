Subject: [RFC][PATCH] Correct AT_PLATFORM for HT P4 in 2.4.21
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi all...
Current kernel fails to set AT_PLATFORM when siblings are present, so HT-P4
fails to publish itself as an i686, and ld.so does not pick automatically
i686 optmized libraries.
Explanation of current bug in create_elf_tables::fs/binfmt_elf.c:
u_platform is used both as the place where platform info is copied at the
beginning of the process data area, and as the stack begin:
- if (k_platform), it is copied at stack top, and u_platform is set to the
  beginning of that info.
- if siblings are present, u_platform is moved to avoid cache conflicts and
  predictability
- the address of u_platform is put to user space, but it has changed and now
  does not point to correct info
This patch separates the two uses, stack and u_platform
Note: it also changes the shifting factor from a fixed 64 to NR_CPUS to save
some space...
