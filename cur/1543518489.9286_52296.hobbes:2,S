I got this after upgrading to 2.2.13,
what should I tweak ??
squid[8196]: aio_queue_request: WARNING - Running out of I/O theads
squid[8196]: aio_queue_request: Perhaps you should increase NUMTHREADS
squid[8196]: aio_queue_request: Or install more disks to share the load
With 2.2.12 its ok, the box is not busy, idle time is 98%
