It isn't just bonnie showing bad performance. My application shows it,
bonnie shows it, and tiobench shows it. I think the focus on putc
may be too intense. It isn't suprizing to me that either the kernel
or glibc may not be optimised on ia64, I'm just trying to figure out
how to get better io rates out of my itanium machine.
