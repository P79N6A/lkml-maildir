I don't know what else I can really suggest. Perhaps it's time to find
a distribution that includes the kernel release you want (or a more
recent one).
Please answer the questions Sam asked:

Look in your kernel source directory. Is there a file there called "vmlinux"?

This file should be found in the root of your kernel tree, too.

Is the build of the kernel failing, thus leaving certain dependancies
not met for the build of the modules? Do you get any error messages
when you run "make" in the kernel source directory?
Again, unless this is a "just for fun" exercise, it might be more
worth your while to get a different distribution with all of this
stuff preconfigured.
