Nodz...

Depends how much of it you're using - you CAN free up swpa space
without rebooting, PROVIDING the swap file or partition you wish to
free up is SMALLER than your unused swap space at the time you wish to
free it up...
Given that condition, have a look at the `swapoff` command...
Best wishes from Riley.
