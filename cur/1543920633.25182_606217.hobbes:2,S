Hello everyone,
I ran lspci -vvv on a system:
http://linux.kernel.free.fr/halt/lspci.txt
(I used lspci version 2.2.5 in case it matters.)
But I'm having a hard time making sense of the output.
1. How many PCI buses are there in the system?
2. Do any of the PCI buses support 66 MHz operation?
3. Do any of the PCI slots support 64-bit data path?
4. Does the system have a PCI-X bus?
Regards.
