Hello there,
I just tried to compile the Linux Kernel version 2.6.11.12
with the most excellent Intel C compiler. It said
drivers/media/video/bt819.c(239): warning #175: subscript out of range
    init[0x19*2-1] = decoder->norm == 0 ? 115 : 93; /* Chroma burst delay */
        ^
This is clearly broken code, since the init data is declared
with 44 elements, but the index is for number 49.
Suggest code rework.
