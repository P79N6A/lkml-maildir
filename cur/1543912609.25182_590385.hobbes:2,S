What you're saying is a plausible problem, but note that it is quite a
completely different issue to what Matti Linnanvuori suggested in the
original bug report.
The report was about module B (which depends on module A, because it
references symbol exported by module A) being able to call a function
(or access data) /exported/ by module A _without_ the module_init()
function of module A having finished completely (and hence the possibility
of accessing uninitialized data etc). But this is not possible -- see the
last reply to Matti.
You're referring to is a module implementing an (possibly un-exported)
function that refers to module-local data, and registering that function
(say through a notifier_block) _before_ initializing_ the data used by
that function. But ...

... exactly. That module is the buggy culprit here, nothing wrong with
the kernel's core module code.
[ BTW I suspect there /are/ modules out there that get this register_foo()
  ordering wrong in their module_init functions.
  Even more widespread (as I have noticed) is the sad habit of modules
  to not unregister_foo() their stuff (in the module_exit function) in
  the exact reverse order of the register_foo() calls made during
  module_init. This can clearly lead to oopsen, but the only reason why
  we don't see them frequently is because the module_init and module_exit
  codepaths are rarely ever executed at runtime, and even more rarely
  concurrently with other stuff that's using the module. ]
