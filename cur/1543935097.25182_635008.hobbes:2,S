I'm happy with a domino effect.  I don't want to see lg->vcpus[0] *anywhere* 
though, because it's non-futureproof.
When I looked through these patches it seems to me that we should accept that 
vcpu is now the basic guest unit, and lg exists to serve it.  Otherwise I 
think you can see the bones of the old UP code poking through, and that's 
ugly.
Thanks!
Rusty.
