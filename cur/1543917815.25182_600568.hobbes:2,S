I agree with you for the original issue.
But the /dev/rtc issue described here has *nothing* to do with mm: I saw 
that with pure Linus' 2.6.23-rc8 + Thomas' hrt1 on top: the combination you 
asked me to test.
So this is an issue in "your" hrt changes. Thomas may have some suggestions, 
but maybe you can have a look as well?
I'm of course willing to do a bisect if needed to narrow this down, but I'd 
like to know who I'll be talking or where I should follow up for issues in 
the hrt patch set.
