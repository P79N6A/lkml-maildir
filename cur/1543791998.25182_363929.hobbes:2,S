Note that this method will produce a split block cursor with EGA, which is
still supported by vgacon, but possibly not used anymore.  Why not use
this method (scanline_end < scanline_start) for VGA, and the default method
(moving the cursor out of the screen) for the rest?
Or why not just set bit 5 of the cursor start register (port 0x0a) to disable
the cursor, and clear to enable? I believe this will also work for the
other types.
