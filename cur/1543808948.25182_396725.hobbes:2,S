I have got the impression that most of IEEE 1394a/ USB 2.0 combo bridges 
on the market are now based on Prolific chips.

Some more findings:
  - The TI StorageLynx based bridge reports device type 0 (TYPE_DISK).
    The problem occurs apparently with page 4 and page 8. Sbp2 has a
    fix since yesterday which sets the skip_ms_page_8 flag.

  - Another bridge made by the same manufacturer but based on TI
    StorageLynx revision A features the same MODE SENSE bug. This bridge
    reports type 14 (TYPE_RBC).
  - I tested a tenth bridge now, based on Initio INIC-2430F. The bridge
    reports TYPE_DISK and seems to support all pages which scsiinfo is
    interested in. Sd_mod is a different story: After sd_mod accesses
    page 8, the kernel panics. (This is discussed in another thread. The
    mentioned sbp2 patch catches this bridge as a skip_ms_page_8
    candidate too, thus avoids the panic. I will eventually check what
    sd_mod is doing; the sbp2 patch is not the real fix.)
Of course sg does not care for any black list flags (like sd_mod and 
sr_mod do), but considering the nature of the bugs and anticipated usage 
of affected devices, there is hardly a reason for further safeguards in 
sbp2, let alone sg.
