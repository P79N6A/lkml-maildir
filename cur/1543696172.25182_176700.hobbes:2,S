Just as some extra information, when I try to shutdown the hotplug
service (via /etc/init.d/hotplug stop), the program hangs and I get
processes in the D state in the output of ps.
Also, when this occurs, lsmod also hangs and is also unkillable.
I am using Debian testing's hotplug, which has version 0.0.20031013-2.
Thanks again for your work, Rogério Brito.
