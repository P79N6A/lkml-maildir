No. We have only one small web server, and we're using an old Pentium
(AFAIK the oldest computer still in use) with Linux & Apache.
NT crashed to often.
But I thought about the benchmark:
It's possible that there is a minor bug if you use this
hardware configuration. I know that Linux doesn't handle unusual
hardware combinations very well: when I installed Linux on one
computer, I had to fix a bug in the SCSI mid-layer before the
computer was usable.
Perhaps someone (I don't have the hardware - we use 10 MBit]) could
install this hardware combination and look for anomalies.
