Right, when it was in the function directly the optimiser seems to have
lopped it off nice and early and got rid of the link failure.

Compiler is as below:
    gcc version 3.3.4 (Debian 1:3.3.4-3)
Yes, making efi_limit_regions() inline also seems to work.  Can we
guarentee it will be inlined though?  I had the feeling that inline was
advisory and if it does not inline then we will get the link failures.
