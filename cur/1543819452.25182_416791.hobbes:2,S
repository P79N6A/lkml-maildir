Well then, have a look at 
http://alphagate.hopto.org/multiadm/
There is a reason to why people [read: I] do not submit out-of-tree (OOT)
modules; because I think chances are low that they get in. Sad fact about the
Linux kernel.

In that case, maybe it would be worthwhile to flip the positions, i.e. LSM on
top of SELinux, sort of a compat layer.
