When booting Linux on a keyboardless machine, the kernel complains about
too many NACKs and suggests a broken keyboard cable, which is not the case
when there is no keyboard attached. The error message could be changed to
a more general one, but I think the right thing to do is to disable
keyboard error reporting since it is only actually useful for debugging
purposes. Many servers such as the ones that I am setting up are 
keyboardless, and I don't think the kernel should complain verbosely
about the admin's descision to not plug in a keyboard.
