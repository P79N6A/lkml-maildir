void trampoline(void (*func)(void *), struct thr_data *thr)
{
	if (thr->scheduler) { 
		struct sched_param p = { sched_priority: thr->sched_pri }; 
		thr->setuperr = sched_setscheduler(getpid(), thr->scheduler, &p); 
		if (thr->setuperr < 0) { 
			_exit(-1) 
		}	
	} 
	
	func(thr->data); 
	..
} 	
Manager checks thr->setuperr after waitpid(). 
The thread itself never runs when it fails.

P.S.: What do you think about the cmpxchg emulation in kernel idea to speed up
the mutexes?
