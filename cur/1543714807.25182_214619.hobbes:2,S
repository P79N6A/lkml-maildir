No. E.g. mq_notify(,&{.sigev_notify=SIGEV_THREAD) cannot be implemented 
in kernel space. And sys_mq_getsetattr isn't posix compliant either - 
the user space library must implement mq_getattr and mq_setattr on top 
of the kernel API.
The kernel API was designed to be simple and flexible. Perhaps we want 
to extend the kernel implementation in the future, and then a leading 
slash could be used to indicate that we are using the new features.
