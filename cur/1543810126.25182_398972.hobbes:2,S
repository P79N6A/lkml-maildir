why do you think so? VPIDs approach supports nested pspaces easily. 
Moreover it can be used in any configuration. See below.

options:
- all pspaces except for host system can live fully with virtual pids
- you can restrict what parent pspace can see from it's child. and as in 
your case you can see only "init".
- you can make fully isolated pspaces, where these problems doesn't 
arise at all.

initial pidspace always sees "global" pids.

See my other emails. This is required.
1. Enter doesn't always work. e.g. due to resource limitations.
2. you may don't want to install some apps inside, especiall taking into 
account that libs in VPS can be broken.

Doesn't look so.
