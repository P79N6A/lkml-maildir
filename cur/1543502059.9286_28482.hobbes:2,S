Interesting. It certainly addresses a serious problem
in the 2.2 series of kernels that causes OOM for
SCSI, sound and floppy devices.  
Jaroslav Kysela <perex@suse.cz> posted a patch addressing
the same problem. It was titled: 'DMA page allocation' and
dated Wednesday 16th June 1999. He has set up a web page
about it at: 
http://www.alsa-project.org/~perex/page_alloc.html
Perhaps you could compare notes.
