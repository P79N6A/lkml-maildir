The reason why I wrote it this way is so that it matches default ld linker
scripts:
...
  .rodata   : { *(.rodata) *(.rodata.*) *(.gnu.linkonce.r.*) }
  .rodata1   : { *(.rodata1) }
...
Of course, *(.rodata*) would work as well and provided nobody creates
sections like .rodatafoo, the behaviour would be the same as well.
