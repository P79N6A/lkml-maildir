I shivered as i wrote it.  I don't consider the periods of
non-redundancy to be prolonged but they are periods of
highest stress on the drives so they are more likely to fail
(even sans Murphy) while doing that than they would
otherwise.  And if you look back at my closing statement
you'll see that i don't recommend it.  I only site it as a
possibility.
Extendibility is i think the only rationalised excuse for
0+1 when 1+0 is available.  I consider it a rationalisation
because by the time you need to extend an array the value of
same-size disks will be questionable.

Absolutely.
