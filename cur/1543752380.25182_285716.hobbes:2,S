Hi all,
I've installed the patches on 2.6.10 (2.6.10-mm1 & realtime-preempt-2.6.10
... .34-01) on my G5 desktop.  The realtime patched kernel wont compile, as
it has a large number of re-defined & conflicting types.  Including:
spinlock_t
rwlock_t
SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED
RW_LOCK_UNLOCKED
and lots of _raw_.*lock types.
It seems the ppc64 architecture hasn't been fleshed out yet for the
real-time preemption patches, or did I just do something moronic?
I'm sitting in front of a couple of G5 desktops and I'd like to help test /
checkout / work on this branch!
TIA.
