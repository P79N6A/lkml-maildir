Probably not.
The main thing they do is to try to be smarter about which active
mapped pages to evict. The slab shrinking balance is pretty well
unchanged.
However there is one path in try_to_free_pages that I've changed
to shrink the slab where it otherwise wouldn't. It is pretty
unlikely that would would be continually running into this path,
but testing is welcome, as always.
Stupid question: you didn't actually say what the problem is...
having 600MB slab cache and 400MB swap may not actually be a
problem provided the swap is not being used and the cache is.
I have an idea it might be worthwhile to try using inactive list
scanning as an input to slab pressure...
