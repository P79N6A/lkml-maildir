Well, finding the cause of this is going to be such a pain in the ass.
With the major IDE change after the serial code went in 2.5, there is
no one kernel I can say "could you try to see what effect that kernel
has" to narrow it down to whether it is really due to the new serial
or due to other changes elsewhere.
You seem to imply that you loose received characters when you get IDE
activity.  It would be nice to find out if how old serial + new IDE or
new serial + old IDE behave.  (Such kernels do not exist.)  Unfortunately,
neither is possible without lots of work, and there presently aren't
enough hours in the day to put together such kernels without co-operation
of other kernel developers.
