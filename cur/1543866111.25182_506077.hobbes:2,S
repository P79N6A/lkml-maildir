Maybe it depends on the filesystem you use. I've used ext3 for 6 or so
years of development on Suspend2, and it's never given me a single
problem, despite the fact that I've sometimes done the equivalent of
pulling the plug without a sync or unmount. I did try XFS at one stage.
It's performance was better, but it did give problems. Nevertheless, I'm
more than happy to make the above claim about ext3.

Isn't that part of the point to having those uuid thingys? I hate them
at the moment (from the point of view of suspend code), but hopefully
they'll end up being nicer to deal with.
