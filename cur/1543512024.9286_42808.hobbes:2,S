Actually, devfs is exactly that. It's just a very minimal namespace wherein
device nodes are registered by name. That's really it. Exporting it through
VFS is very natural from there.

I don't think broad changes can be included unless their entire lifecycle
is planned out, ie, it isn't just a hook. I'm not sure if I've communicated
my point... It seems we would be shipping hooks with no real userland
accessability in this scenario, correct me if I'm wrong...
