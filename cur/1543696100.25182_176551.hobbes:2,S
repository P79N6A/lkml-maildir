Ulrich meant glibc CVS HEAD.
For some reason, stdio locking was not using the jump around lock prefix
variant of locking:
            __asm __volatile ("cmpl $0, %%gs:%P6\n\t"                         \
                              "je,pt 0f\n\t"                                  \
                              "lock\n"                                        \
                              "0:\tcmpxchgl %1, %2\n\t"                       \
                              "jnz _L_mutex_lock_%=\n\t"                      \
			      ".subsection 1\m\t" ...
but one without the first 2 insns, so there were 2 instructions with lock
prefix in putc and similar functions even when only one thread was running.
