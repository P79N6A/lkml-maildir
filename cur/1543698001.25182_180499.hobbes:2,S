Hello Ross,

Thanks, that's quite a nice overview.
But something seems strange:

> PREM,APIC,LAPIC                                         S
Does those two lines mean, that using ACPI, APIC and local APIC
enabled is stable, as long as your kernel is not an SMP kernel? If
yes, then I can't confirm this. I run strictly non-SMP kernels and
they always crash if APIC (or local APIC?) is enabled.
BTW, I use a very quick test to see if the system is stable, that also
can be performed when booting with a "read-only init=/bin/bash" LILO
command line (so that no filesystem will need to fsck after a crash):
just type hdparm -t /dev/hd<someharddrive> several times.
Regards,
Julien
