No, it was a BSD out-of-tree module, I don't even remember what
it was anymore, it's probably not significant, but if "tainted"
is exported, it seems like some binary module writers might get
the brilliant idea to twiddle it by hand.  How about something
like this to enforce the idea that taintedness is add-only:
void add_taint(unsigned int flags);
unsigned int get_taint(void);
static unsigned int tainted;
Then use atomic bit operations on platforms which have them and
a spinlock on those that don't.  My guess where the lack of
locking might cause issues is if we hit an MCE and bad_page at
the same time on SMP or something.  It seems like it would be
really rare in practice, but I guess that appropriately timed
badness in multiple drivers (perhaps one triggered by the other?)
could cause it to occur.

Or that :-D.  The only way I can see this dying or accidentally
untainting is if two processors try to add different types of
taint simultaneously.

software stuff and not get a real job. Charles Shultz had the best  
answer:

it because

draw
cartoons. It's my life."
