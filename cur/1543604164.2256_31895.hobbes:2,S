It doesn't work, only the behaviour changed:
Linux now ignores the setuid bit if you try to ptrace a setuid app (idea from FreeBSD).
Up to 2.2.18 [and 2.4.0-pre?], it tried to return an error message if you try to ptrace a setuid app, and there was a race window
between the test (must be early, since it tries to return an error code) and the actual uid change. I haven't checked how it was
fixed in 2.2.19.
