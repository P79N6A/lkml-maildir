Okay, so bring me the sledgehammer.

You are wrong.
swsusp1 fails your test, swsusp2 fails your test, and pmdisk fails it,
too. If half of memory is used by kmalloc(), there's no sane way to
make suspend-to-disk working. And swsusp[12] does not. Granted, half
of memory kmalloc-ed is unusual situation, but it can theoreticaly
happen. Try mem=8M or something.
So stop spreading nonsense about "NO COMPROMISES" and stop comparing
me to Mickey$oft. Thanks.

So don't put swsusp into car-braking system.
