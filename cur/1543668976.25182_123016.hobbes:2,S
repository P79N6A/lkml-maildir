It just caused sshd to hang. I don't know why Here's what strace reports:
Sshd is stuck in 'D' and a child in zombie state. The machine has been up
for 2 days 18 hours 50 mins.
Somehow, although those changes fix the kernel from oopsing, its now causing
other tty issues somewhere.
Any ideas?
Shawn.

Andrew, since the new timer changes made, Things are looking solid so far.
We might want to begin adding things into BK-current no?
Sshd hasn't hung, ttys haven't hung either.
