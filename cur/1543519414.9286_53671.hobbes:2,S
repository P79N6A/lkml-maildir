How serious?  [Factor of two?  Four?  Less?]
If you look at this as a requirement for very-coarse-granularity updates,
what happens?  [Do you run out of memory trying to cache the entire disk?
Do you wind up never writing anything to disk?  Do you wind up writing
the same stuff too often?  Some other set of possibilities?]
I'd think that raid5 just means that the size of a logical block
to be written must be larger, but I'm not the expert you folks are.
Thanks,
