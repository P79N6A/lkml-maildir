You need to do the IPIs before you look at the hazard pointers.

The problem is you don't know when the hazard pointer was set to NULL.
It could have been set soon after the IPI interrupt was received and
any outstanding accesses made since the IPI interrupt aren't syncronized
with respect to setting the hazard pointer to null.
But if you looked at the hazard pointer in the IPI interrupt handler,
you could use that information to decide whether you had to wait an
additional RCU interval.  So updater logic would be
          1.  Set global pointer to NULL.  // make object unreachable
          2.  Send IPIs  to all other CPUs
              (IPI interrupt handler will copy CPU's hazard pointers)
          3.  Check objects to be freed against copied hazard pointers.
          4.  There is no step 4.  Even if the actual hazard pointers
              that pointed to the object is NULL by this point (but not
              its copy), you'd still have to wait and addtional RCU
              interval so you might as well leave it out as redundant.
This is better.  I may try that trick I used to make NPTL condvars
faster to see if I can keep Linux user space version of this from
tanking.  It uses unix signals instead of IPIs.

Yes, it might better be called RCU+SMR+RCU in that case.

I've done plenty of that.  I have some atomically thread-safe reference
counting impletations and a proxy GC based on those which I compare to
an RCU for user threads implementation.  Using lock-free in user space
gives you much more dramatic performance improvements than in the kernel.
It cuts down on unnecessary context switching which can slow things down
considerably.  Also mutexes and rwlocks are prone to starvation.  Making
them FIFO for guaranteed service order slows them down even further.
I usually use a semaphore to keep the updaters from running out of  
resources.
It slows down updater throughput but then I'm more concerned with reader
throughput.  If I want faster recovery of resources I'll used the atomic
refcounted pointer or the proxy based on it.  Slightly slower updater  
performance
but resources are recovered more quickly.
