It didnt make sense two decades ago either, the VAX 8300 could be made to 
go 6way and it stopped going faster around the third processor added.
(my memory is a bit rusty, but I believe this is what we came up with when 
we got donated a few of those in the mid 90ties and yes, they're not from 
83 but perhaps from 86-87 so not two decades ago either).
