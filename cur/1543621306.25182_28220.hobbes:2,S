I did try out the patch.  
The first time I used the driver there was major damage to the fs on one 
of my zip disks (so the "mv bigassfile /mnt/zip/" failed miserably), but 
I couldn't be sure that the driver was the root cause so I didn't email 
you about it.
Thereafter, I tried mounting/unmounting, writing new filesystems, 
writing/reading large files...
everything checked out fine.
You should definitely forward your patch to LKML and Linus.
