It is not unlikely because it care too much about the higher order

Is this with raiserfs and/or nfs? And without highmem support?
Why is 2-order allocations needed???
Can anyone answer?
Higher order allocs during normal operation is not that nice...

Might also be related to the higher order. Freeing too much inactive pages
to satisfy the request...
SMP might be a factor since the patch will go harder on the locks...

But the real problem might be - why are the higher order allocations
needed anyway?
