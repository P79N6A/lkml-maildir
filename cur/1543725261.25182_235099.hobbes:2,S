Subject: [PATCH] fix readahead breakage for sequential after random reads
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Andrew,
Current readahead logic is broken when a random read pattern is
followed by a long sequential read.  The cause is that on a window
miss ra->next_size is set to ra->average, but ra->average is only
updated at the end of a sequence, so window size will remain 1 until
the end of the sequential read.
This patch fixes this by taking the current sequence length into
account (code taken from towards end of page_cache_readahead()), and
also setting ra->average to a decent value in handle_ra_miss() when
sequential access is detected.
Please apply!
