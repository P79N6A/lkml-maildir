 applied?
Hmm, does not apply to 2.6.23-rc2:
2 out of 2 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file kernel/power/Kconfig.rej
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file arch/x86_64/Kconfig.rej
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file arch/arm/Kconfig.rej
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file arch/i386/Kconfig.rej
1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file arch/powerpc/Kconfig.rej
It doesn't seem to touch arch/ppc/Kconfig but only arch/powerpc/Kconfig 
- should it make any difference at all?
