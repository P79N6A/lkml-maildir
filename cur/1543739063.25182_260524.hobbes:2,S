Thanks for the info. As I mentioned, the enclosure works flawlessly for 
me under 2.4.27. It's getting detected incorrectly only in 2.6.x. 
Another user reported a similar problem but was able to get dvd burning 
working by removing the checks from the writing tool. So, it looks like 
detection has been messed up only in 2.6.x.
Once again, 2.6.8 reports it as

whereas 2.4.27 correctly reports

I checked the kernel sources. Sure enough, 
drivers/usb/storage/unusual_devs.h
has a new entry in the 2.6 tree:
========
/* <torsten.scherer@uni-bielefeld.de>: I don't know the name of the bridge
 * manufacturer, but I've got an external USB drive by the Revoltec company
 * that needs this. otherwise the drive is recognized as /dev/sda, but any
 * access to it blocks indefinitely.
 */
UNUSUAL_DEV(  0x0402, 0x5621, 0x0103, 0x0103,
        "Revoltec",
        "USB/IDE Bridge (ATA/ATAPI)",
        US_SC_DEVICE, US_PR_DEVICE, NULL, US_FL_FIX_INQUIRY),
========
I have not yet tested after removing this entry, but this looks to be 
the likely problem. The enclosure actually supports both 3.5 IDE hard 
disks as well as 5.25 CD/DVD drives. I have no clue why this entry 
should cause the drive to be wrongly detected. CCing linux-usb-devel for 
help.
Please CC me on replies to linux-usb-devel since I am not subscribed to 
that list. Thanks.
