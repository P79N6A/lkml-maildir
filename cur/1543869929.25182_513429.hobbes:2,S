Obviously there must be several real threads, each of them can reschedule 
userspace threads, because it is fast and scalable.
So, one CPU - one real thread.

And here were start our discussion again from the begining :)
We entered kernel, of course, but then kernel decides to move thread
away and put another one on its place under hardware sun - so kernel
starts to move registers, change some states and so on.
While in case of userspace threads we arelady returned back to userspace
(on behalf of written above overhead) and start doing new task - move
registers, change some states and so one.
And somehow it happens that doing it in userspace (for example with
setjmp/longjmp) is faster than in kernel. I do not know why - I never
investigated that case, but that is it.

Threads happen to be really fast, and easy to programm, but the maximum
performance still can not be achieved with them just because event
handling is faster - read one cacheline from the ring or queue, or
reschedule threads?
Anyway, what we are talking about, Ingo?
I understand your point, I also understand that you are not going to
change it (yes, that's it, but I need to confirm that I'm guilty too - I
doubtly will think that thousands of threads doing IO is a win), so we
can close the discussion at this point.
My main point in participating in it was kevent introduction - although
I created kevent AIO as a state machine, I never wanted to promote
kevent as AIO - kevent is event processing mechanism, one of its usage
models is AIO, another ones are signals, file events, timers, whatever...
You drawn a line - kevent is not needed - that is your point.
I wanted to hear definitive wordsa half a year ago, but community kept
silence. Eventually things are done.
Thanks.
