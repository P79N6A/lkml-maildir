a) thank you; I've been wondering why so many people seem unable to see
   the obvious.
b) I should mention, on the Alpha, CBAUDEX is defined as 0, and the used
   states are 0..30, so the spare state is 31
   But again, there *is* a spare state that can be used when a custom
   baud rate is queried via the backward-compatible inerface.
