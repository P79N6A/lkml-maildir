	There is a *completely* userspace solution for such things. Teach
sudo which capabilities it should leave. That's it. 'ask admin to mark
executable' == be included into sudoers with appropriate set of
capabilities. sudo allows different behaviour basing on a command, host,
user and arguments of said command. And it leaves audit trail. No need to
touch the kernel at all - tool already exists, so why reinvent the wheel?
