Oh, I didn't know that symbol existed. I just looked at the serial
Kconfig, not arch/arm/Kconfig. You're right of course.

Right. Probably shouldn't have changed the prompt -- I have a different
patch that actually adds AVR32 support (I don't want to do that before
it actually compiles on AVR32, in case some crazy person comes along
and tries out allyesconfig ;)
Is it OK if I keep the patch as it is and change the dependency and
help text in a later patch?
