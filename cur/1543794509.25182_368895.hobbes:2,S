Martin,
Once again thank you for finding useful data on hard problems.   I don't 
think this will be too hard to code into the cifs vfs (I also wish ntfs 
already had worker functions for setfacl and chmod similar to this...) 
but now the interesting question is how fast it is worth coding and 
getting in mainline -
1)  acl and chmod mapping (ie the ntfs security descriptor like way, 
rather than Samba-only posix acl way),  and
2) Kerberos/SPNEGO session setup
are the two most common requests for the cifs vfs these days.   The 
upcall for Kerberos support is begun but not complete, and it has taken 
longer than I had hoped partly due to lack of examples - the only uses 
of the new cn.ko (Linux "connector") posted so far are simpler 
(notification up, rather than "request up /response down").
