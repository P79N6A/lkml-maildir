Hello,
this is 100% reproduceable on my 2.2.12:
while [ 1 ]; to telnet 127.0.0.1 1234; done
(where 1234 is a tcp port not being bind()'d, works with any other
unused port):
gives a lot of 
Trying 127.0.0.1...
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused
end after few seconds/minutes ends up with:
Connected to 127.0.0.1.
Escape character is '^]'.
I insist, there is no daemon listening on the specified port.
Anything i type in is simply echo'd.
Thanks,
