Well, this isn't only networking, It started with all the apps running
and ended up with a pretty basic desktop with almost nothing running...

programs)

I have never, to my knowledge, had this happen before... 
I just happened to start a few downloads with rtorrent and watched the
machine slow down to a crawl... All this with over a gig in cache.
The machine was actually deadlocked for almost a minute at one time.
Top memory usage:
  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND                  
 2395 pomac     20   0  440m 289m 238m S    2 14.4  32:56.54 rtorrent
21647 root      20   0  203m 120m  10m S    1  6.0 569:45.31 X                        
 2351 pomac     20   0  170m 111m  53m S    0  5.5  15:43.66 rtorrent          
At peak time, one of the rtorrent processes consumed more, but i still
had 1.x gig as cache, which imho should have been reclaimed.
vmstat now:
procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ----cpu----
 r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa
 0  0 365204  16628  30644 1445316    2    1   362    92   18   21  4  2 91  3
PS. I have a dmesg dump from the incident, it's not long enough to
contain all but it could be seen as a snapshot...
DS.
