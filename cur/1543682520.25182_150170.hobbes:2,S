I read the two README files and started to try building the first one
starting with "./configure --prefix=/" as directed.  It said:
  /home/ndiamond/modutils-2.4.21-18/SOURCES/module-init-tools-0.9.11a/missing: Unknown `--run' option
  Try `/home/ndiamond/modutils-2.4.21-18/SOURCES/module-init-tools-0.9.11a/missing --help' for more information
I tried that command for help.  Indeed it says there's no such thing as a
"--run" option.  Looks like I lied.  I don't know how to compile the new
module utilities.
One thing is interesting though.  This configure script figured out that my
cpu is an i586.
By the way, the last line in that README file says that if this is all too
complicated then install the source RPM.  Gee thanks.  I already tried
"rpm --rebuild" but it assumes an i686.
