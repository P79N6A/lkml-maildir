I do agree that the directory inode number would better not be part of the 
filehandle. In this thread I'm trying to argue why trying to compute 
pathnames based on nfs file handles makes no sense though, and that the sane 
thing is not to even try.

I'm glad to be proven wrong here. Pathnames for nfs remain meaningless even 
without mount point aliasing, though.

No worries, the super_block is not hanging off struct vfsmount, it's hanging 
off struct dentry.
Thanks,
