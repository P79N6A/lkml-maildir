Agreed. Now, reread what I said above, and tell me why this is an
argument for doing dsa in the kernel?

Turning off coredump is trivial. All the features that LSM provide apply
to userland too (including security_ptrace()), so the SELinux policies
are not an argument for putting stuff in the kernel.
Only the swap-out to disk is an issue, and that is less of a worry if
you use a time-limited proxy in the daemon.

Has anyone tried to look for simpler signing mechanisms that make use of
the crypto algorithms that are already in the kernel?
