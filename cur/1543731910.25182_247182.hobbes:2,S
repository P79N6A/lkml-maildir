Subject: [PATCH] identifier string for P4 Prescott

A trivial patch to change the identifier in the kernel from "Unknown CPU 
[15:3]" to "Pentium 4(tm) Prescott".  Although Prescott is not the 
official name of the chip (I think Intel just decided to go with the 
P4 name), I do think it is useful to be able to identify this chip 
separately (given that it has a different core).  This is a patch against 
2.4.27
