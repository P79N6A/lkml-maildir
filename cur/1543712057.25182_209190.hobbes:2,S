Given my recent work in bug fixing, and in isolating some problems to 
the platform rather than libata, the Silicon Image driver will be moving 
to beta, and the CONFIG_BROKEN marker removed, as soon as 2.6.5 kernel 
is out.
With the latest patches, I would say status of sata_sil is now "beta".
To answer your other question, yes, I progressive update the document 
you quoted to reflect updates in the status of the various drivers.
