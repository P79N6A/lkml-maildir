After a bit of googling...
Andries Brouwer suggested include/linuxabi with arch-specific dirs
H. Peter Anvin apparently suggested putting them in include/abi, with 
arch-specific dirs.  However, he thinks its too much work for 2.6 and sees it as 
an early 2.7 thing.
Matthew Wilcox apparently suggested something similar
Jeff Garzik approved the idea
Rob Landley suggested moving your headers there and then cleaning up the other 
headers, and expressed willingness to submit patches.
Sam Ravnborg supported the idea
Eric Biederman supported the idea, suggested linux-only namespace and 
version-based naming, figured it was 2.7 work
David Miller approved the idea
Maybe this should be a topic for the kernel summit or a BOF session at OLS?
