It would be probably hopeless at least in the 2-6 letter TLA space. 
Every possible TLA has been already used for countless other things.
Just live with the collisions. Or use names instead of them.
cpuinfo flags are deeply architecture specific anyways, so I don't
think it makes much sense to try to get them unique over architectures.
In fact I think ppc doesn't even have a "flags" line.
