Hi all,
	I have recently encounter a weird raid 1 problem on my system. Here is 
my setup:
i have two ide harddisk on a promise ide control card (PDC20262)
and here is my /etc/raidtab file
raiddev       /dev/md0
raid-level    1
chunk-size    64k
persistent-superblock 1
nr-raid-disks 2
     device    /dev/hdd1
     raid-disk 0
     device    /dev/hdb1
     raid-disk 1
the file system is XFS. everything works most of time except from time 
to time, files seem to get corrupted. I test the integrity by running 
rpm --checks *.rpm continuously to verify the signature of the file.
the corrupted files seem to 'recover' itself if i leave the machine 
alone for a while or umount and mount back the filesystem.
does anyone have this type of temperory file corruption problem? I 
tested it against 2.4.2x kernel including the last vanilla 2.4.22 + xfs 
patches, they all seem to have the same problem
Thanks,
-Ying
