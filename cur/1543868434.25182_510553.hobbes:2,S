Yes. utf8 support is broken, and it will fail to convert letter case
on many case. And it's why that is not recommended.

`?' is meaning the character can't be converted.

It seems readdir() was success, but stat() was failed. And the dosfsck
doesn't check filename correctly.
Those problem seem to be relateing to poor utf8 support...
