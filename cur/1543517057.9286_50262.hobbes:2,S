I'm know very little about Intel MP 1.4 but I know for sure that DOS, Windows9X
and WindowsNT will hung on Dell PowerEdge 2300 when you'll try to access
EtherExpress (in Linux first EtherExpress uses 20 IRQ and second uses 21 IRQ).
You can boot DOS on Dell PowerEdge 2300 just fine as long as you do not try to
use external devices: first PCI slot using 20 IRQ, second PCI slot using 21 IRQ,
third -- 22 IRQ and so on (I mean PCI interrupt A)... I still have 2.2.5ac6
installed there though since 2.2.10ac10 refused to support IDE on 22 IRQ -- it
was sure (even when I told in command line that my ide0 is using 22 IRQ !) my
Tekram is using standard 14 IRQ and complained about "lost IRQ" while I can
not play much with our main server so I decided to go back to 2.2.5ac6 .
I'm not sure if such configuration is correct according to MP 1.4 but it's how
it all works just fine under Linux -- uptime 51 days (and I'm not sure why it
does not work under DOS, Windows9X and under "normal" WindowsNT -- may be all
three OSes hung while loading EtherExpress driver only by concidence but it'll
be REALLY strage coincidence)...
