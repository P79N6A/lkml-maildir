TCO watchdog works on my old P-III machine.  After writing to
/dev/watchdog, about 50 (not 30) seconds later, it reboots.
Oh, I see.  Two choices:
use: echo -n 1 > /dev/watchdog
or when you use: cat > /dev/watchdog
and press CR, that doesn't close /dev/watchdog yet.
You need to kill cat (^C) and then /dev/watchdog is closed
and the watchdog timer starts counting.  You will (should) see
a message like so:
  i8xx TCO timer: Unexpected close, not stopping watchdog!
then wait awhile, then it reboots.
