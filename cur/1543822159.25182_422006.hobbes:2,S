Yea, it's decent :) I asked for the big one since this way we can test
IRQs "wrapping  around".

It should always find the entry it's done the first one around actually,
the first thing in mp_register_gsi() will check for it I think.

Sure - for i386, but Len, we would have to bring it into x86_64 and make
this thing above (or something like this) to be a default handler, yes.

OK.. besides note that only pretty large system will wrap around to get
unused IRQs, the rest of the world is getting pretty much default
behavior, pre-compression time so to speak :)

Ok, sounds good. I will put something together according to the above
and hopefully test it soon.
