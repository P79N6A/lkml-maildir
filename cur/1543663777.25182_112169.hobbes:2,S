A quick back of the napkin estimate guesstimates that this 3ware stuff
would max at 6 racks of disks on NUMA-Q or 3/8 of a rack per node
(ignoring cabling, which looks infeasible, but never mind that), which
is a smaller capacity than I remember FC having. NUMA-Q's a bit
optimistic for 3ware because it has buttloads of PCI slots in
comparison to more modern machines.
