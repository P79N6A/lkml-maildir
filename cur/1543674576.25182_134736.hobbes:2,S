Yep, a few quick tests suggest that #739 looks to be fixed by Alex's
patch, and it removes the assert from 2023, so if that's bogus then his
patch fixes that too.  I did see a hang with his patch and I wasn't able
to get any output or sysrq, so I'm going to go back and try with
nmi_watchdog to see if it'll tell me anything new.  I'm not sure if I
just didn't get far enough to see this without his patch, or if it comes
in the door with it though.  Also a few extra "sleeping function called
from illegal context" goodies on boot with it.  I'm going to get this
test kicked of right now but I'll be out until Tuesday so if it doesn't
show up again quickly I won't be seeing it until then.
Thanks,
