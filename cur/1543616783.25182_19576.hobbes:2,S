Hm, I am not quite sure about what you expect to hear about it, but:
a) It applies cleanly to 2.4.18-pre3.
b) It compiles
c) During a load of around 150 produced by (of course :-) "make -j bzImage" and
concurrent XMMS playing while my mail-client and mozilla are open, I cannot
"feel" a real big difference in interactivity compared to vanilla kernel. XMMS
hickups sometimes, mouse does kangaroo'ing, switching around different
X-screens and screen refresh (especially mozilla of course) are no big hit.
This is a dual PIII-1GHz/2 GB RAM and some swap. During make no swapping is
going on.
Sorry, but I cannot see (feel) the difference in _this_ test (if this is really
a test for what you intend to do). Compile time btw makes no difference either.
Perhaps this try is rather something for ingo and the scheduler...
Regards,
Stephan
