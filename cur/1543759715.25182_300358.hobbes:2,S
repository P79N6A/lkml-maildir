- Yes, but linux-box can be a all-vlan-bridge without the 8021q
module. So, in a some cases of configuration (like currently is my
own) nobody in kernel can set skb->priority in the forwarded packets.
But I (as a user) can expect than the bridge with QoS will able to
plain and evident prioritization without my immersion into ebtables...
1) I will put the verification by pskb_may_pull() as pointed Patrick
McHardy. It is just my mistake/bug.
2) Despite of opportunities ebtables I think, that this addition is
necessary. As small forces, by default, provide more correct and
expected behaviour of system, without conflicts to other
opportunities.
3) But I think, it is not necessary to provide a customization of
mapping .1q priority to skb->priority (e.g. clone a code from
VLAN-module) for the following reasons:
    - my patch is intended only for the basic, obvious behaviour;
    - ebtables already provide a powerful abilities;
    - user can expect that the bridge will not require more
      configuration that currently is provided;
