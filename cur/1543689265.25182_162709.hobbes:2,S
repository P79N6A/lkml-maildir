Don't you want to put a max(10,TIMESLICE_GRANULARITY) in there so that the
time slice won't go below 1ms for large proc servers?  I'm not sure if it
was you, or someone else but they did some testing to see how the
timeslice length affected the cache warmth, and the major improvements
stopped after 7ms, so 10 might be a good default mimimum.
