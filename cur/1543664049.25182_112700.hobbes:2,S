You can't have non-integer numbers of processors.  HT is a hack that
makes what appears to be two processors using common silicon.
The fact it's slower than a really dual CPU box is irrelevant in some
sense, you still need SMP smart to deal with it; it's only important
when you want to know why performance increases aren't apparent or you
loose performance in some cases... (ie. other virtual CPU thrashing
the cache).

I overstated things thinking SMP/HT would be in low-end hardware given
two years.
As Alan pointed out, since the 'Walmart' class hardware is 'whatever
is cheapest' then perhaps HT/SMT/whatever won't be common place for
super-low end boxes in two years --- but I would be surprised if it
didn't gain considerable market share elsewhere.

UP != HT
HT is SMP with magic requirements.  For multiple physical CPUs the
requirements become even more complex; you want to try to group tasks
to physical CPUs, not logical ones lest you thrash the cache.
Presumably there are other tweaks possible two, cache-line's don't
bounce between logic CPUs on a physical CPU for example, so some locks
and other data structures will be much faster to access than those
which actually do need cache-lines to migrate between different
physical CPUs.  I'm not sure if these specific property cane be
exploited in the general case though.

Present 2.5.x looks like it will have smarts for HT as a subset of
NUMA.
If HT does become more common and similar things abound, I'm not sure
if it even makes sense to have a UP kernel for certain platforms
and/or CPUs --- since a mere BIOS change will affect what is
'virtually' apparent to the OS.
