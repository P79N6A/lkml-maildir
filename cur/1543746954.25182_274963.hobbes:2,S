The existing evil user code is broken already. Any of the above can be
implemented in a such a way that it only works in the kernel anyway.
We don't need to preserve it any more than we need to preserve evil
broken code which defines __KERNEL__ before including certain headers.
We're supposed to be cleaning this crap up. If we want every evil broken
hack that's currently possible to _remain_ possible, it's never going to
work.
