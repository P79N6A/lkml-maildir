Hi, all,
I am new to this maillist. I want to boot my system
from a single floppy. If I use 1.44MB, the space
is too small. So I format my floppy to 1.6MB.
I do the following things,
#fdformat /dev/fd0H1600
#cp /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/zImage /dev/fd0
#rdev /dev/fd0 /dev/fd0
#rdev -r /dev/fd0 49552
When I boot from floppy, the console print:
Loading...........
But then not print other things, then system
reboot again.
I read arch/i386/boot/bootsect.S file and find
no support for 1.6MB floppy. How can I support
this floppy in kernel? 
If someone knows, please help me.
Thanks in advance!
Qingbo
