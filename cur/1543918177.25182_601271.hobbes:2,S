More information:
* No improvement in 2.6.23-rc9.
* Building the same config on a different system with the same
  toolchain, fails the same. So it's not just one system acting weirdly,
  the bug can be reproduced.
* I tried arbitrary values for the kzalloc() in dmi-id.c, the bottom line
  is that anything above 64 bytes triggers the bug.
* The same kzalloc() in a different driver doesn't trigger the bug.
I'm puzzled, no idea what to try next.
