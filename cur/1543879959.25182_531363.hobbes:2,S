The problem is not CPU synchronized TSC, but TSC with varying frequency
on a single CPU like on the A64.
The old implementation can lose really badly on that because it mixes
measurements at different frequencies together without individual scaling.
The error gets worse the longer the system runs.

I've been pondering for some time if doubling the NMI watchdog as a 
ring 0 counter for this is worth it. So far I'm still undecided
(and it's moot now since it's disabled by default :/)
