Hi Arthur,
I'm a little concerned about changing the API for the dma_ foo
functions, which are defined cross platform. If you want to change
that, I think it will require updating the documentation explaining
it.
Regarding ARCH_DOES_POSTED_DMA, is that sufficient as a #define or
does it have to be run-time tested? (does it do anything at this
stage). I ask since not all ia64 platforms do posted DMA.
Cheers,
Jes
