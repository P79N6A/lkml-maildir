This is not necessarily faster.
I recently came across some discussions on the web from Jim Gettys that
discussed similar issues for X (unix sockets vs shared memory).  I seem to
remember that the over head of synchronizing stuff to keep the shared
memory in a sane state ate away at any gains one had with using shared
memory.  It works ok for large chunks of data (say, things on the order of
sizes of pixmaps), but not for smaller pieces, like say, function call
arguments.
Then again, isn't Jim some how involved in ORBit and GNOME?  Or just a big
supporter?  :->
