Sort of --- there are various flush commands we can use.  However, bio
can't just submit the barriers, it needs to synchronise them, and that
means doing a global wait over all the devices until they have all
acked their barrier op.  That's expensive: you may be as well off just
using the current fs-internal synchronous commands at that point.
