Hi!
This is a really interesting issue. :-)
<michael@michael>:/tmp>dir -d kkk/ ddd 
-rw-r--r--   1 michael  users           5 Dec 16 00:14 ddd
drwxr-xr-x   2 michael  users        1024 Dec 16 00:15 kkk//
<michael@michael>:/tmp>
So let's look what strace says:
<michael@michael>:/tmp>strace cat ddd/
...
fstat(1, {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0622, st_rdev=makedev(3, 0), ...}) = 0
open("ddd/", O_RDONLY)                  = -1 ENOTDIR (Not a directory)
write(2, "cat: ", 5cat: )                    = 5
write(2, "ddd/", 4ddd/)                     = 4
write(2, ": Not a directory", 17: Not a directory)       = 17
write(2, "\n", 1
)                       = 1
close(1)                                = 0
_exit(1)                                = ?
<michael@michael>:/tmp>strace cat kkk/
...
fstat(1, {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0622, st_rdev=makedev(3, 0), ...}) = 0
open("kkk/", O_RDONLY)                  = 3
fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=1024, ...}) = 0
brk(0x8005000)                          = 0x8005000
read(3, 0x8002b30, 4096)                = -1 EISDIR (Is a directory)
write(2, "cat: ", 5cat: )                    = 5
write(2, "kkk/", 4kkk/)                     = 4
write(2, ": Is a directory", 16: Is a directory)        = 16
write(2, "\n", 1
)                       = 1
close(3)                                = 0
close(1)                                = 0
_exit(1)                                = ?
If I try to open the file "ddd/" open fails, because it isn't a
directory and a trailing "/" means it is a directory.
If I try to open the file "kkk/" open does not fail but read does,
because this is a directory and you can open a directory, but you can't
read it like a file.
If you say that "/" is a delimitor like a space, then this shouldn't
fail.
<michael@michael>:/tmp>cat/kkk/
bash: cat/kkk/: No such file or directory
<michael@michael>:/tmp>
Greetings, Michael
