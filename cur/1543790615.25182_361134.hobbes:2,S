Well, Andi's patch here wasn't just a small optimization as the changelog 
suggests. It helped EM64T boxes a great deal.  Just to make sure, I 
reran 2.6.14 with the attached patch and got about 45% better performance 
with iozone Initial write.  This was on a 2 cpu 4 thread SMP Xeon with 8G ram,
with 2 processes performing io to 4G files on a IDE drive.  
Maybe it wouldn't have caused breakage on some AMD boxes if the following
additional check for swiotlb was added.  Can this go into 2.6.15 please?
Thanks,
Kiran
Originally by Andi Kleen.  Patch prevents the block layer from bouncing if 
a hard or soft iommu is present.
