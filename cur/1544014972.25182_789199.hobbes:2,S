Do you mean something like this?
		dmatest_init_srcbuf(thread->srcbuf, src_off, len);
		dmatest_init_dstbuf(thread->dstbuf, dst_off, len);
		dma_src = dma_map_single(dev->dev, src + src_off, len,
			 DMA_TO_DEVICE);
		dma_dest = dma_map_single(dev->dev, dest_buf, test_buf_size,
			DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL);
		tx = dev->device_prep_dma_memcpy(chan, dma_dest + dst_off,
				dma_src, len,
				DMA_CTRL_ACK | DMA_COMPL_SKIP_DEST_UNMAP);
		if (!tx) {
			/* error */
		}
		tx->callback = NULL;
		cookie = tx->tx_submit(tx);
		...
		/* wait for completion */
		...
		dma_unmap_single(dev->dev, dma_dest, test_buf_size,
			DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL);
It will make dmatest more aggressive, for example, a option for
testing DMA_PREP_INTERRUPT handling of a lowlevel driver can be added
easily.
