Maybe try using the ip route tool, and pretending ip-aliases don't
exist:
# Add three different addresses to eth0
ip addr add 10.1.1.1/24 dev eth0
ip addr add 10.1.1.2/24 dev eth0
ip addr add 1.2.3.4/24 dev eth0
# Route to different networks with different source addresses
ip route add 10.1.1.0/24 src 10.1.1.1 dev eth0
ip route add 10.0.0.0/8 src 10.1.1.2 dev eth0
ip route add default src 1.2.3.4 dev eth0
