1. "No need".  Doesn't apply to everybody of course, but
   many have enough memory and don't plug in much new stuff.
   Recompiling & booting for the rare occation where you
   bought a new usb device is ok.  
2. A simpler setup.  No /etc/modules.conf to worry about.
   Compiling ALSA into the kernel surely made life easier.
   even more so when also using devfs...
3. Performance.  Compiled-in stuff is always there, and
   on x86 it exists in the kernel's 4M page so no
   TLB loading overhead either.

Actually, that isn't an argument for linking everything in.
All you need is the drivers for your root fs and root device.
The rest may still be modular, loaded from /lib/modules on
that root fs.
