We certainly need to do /something/ here, but I'm not sure this is it. 
Adam Belay has code to limit PCI state restoration to the PCI-specified 
registers, with the idea being that individual drivers fix things up 
properly. While this has the obvious drawback that almost every PCI 
driver in the tree would then need fixing up, it's also probably the 
right thing.
