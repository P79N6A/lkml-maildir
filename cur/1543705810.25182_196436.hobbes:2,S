I think cdrecord should be hacked to complain loudly if the device is
already mounted.  Regardless of the device cache not being cleared,
(which is a firmware bug, in my opinion), blanking a mounted device is
usually not what the user intended.  This is not a kernel problem as
such, and should be dealt with in userspace.
