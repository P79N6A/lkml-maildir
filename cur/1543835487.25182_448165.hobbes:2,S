Hi folks,
I tried to spin down my harddisk using hdparm, but when it is
supposed to spin up again, then it is blocked for quite some
time. dmesg says:
ata1.00: exception Emask 0x0 SAct 0x0 SErr 0x0 action 0x2 frozen
ata1.00: (BMDMA stat 0x20)
ata1.00: tag 0 cmd 0xca Emask 0x4 stat 0x40 err 0x0 (timeout)
ata1: port is slow to respond, please be patient
ata1: port failed to respond (30 secs)
ata1: soft resetting port
ata1.00: configured for UDMA/133
ata1: EH complete
SCSI device sda: 312581808 512-byte hdwr sectors (160042 MB)
sda: Write Protect is off
sda: Mode Sense: 00 3a 00 00
SCSI device sda: drive cache: write back
The disk is a SAMSUNG SP1614C.
On another machine (with a SAMSUNG SP2504C inside) there is no
such problem: The disk is back after just a few seconds.
Is there some trick to wake up the disk a little bit faster?
Regards
Harri
