Hi Andrew
Please consider for inclusion... resending with changelog per Andrew.

This patch makes CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU depend on !X86_PC, so we need to turn on 
either CONFIG_GENERICARCH, CONFIG_BIGSMP or any other subarch except X86_PC when
CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=y
With 2.6.15+ kernels when CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU is turned on we switch to bigsmp mode for
sending IPI's and ioapic configurations that caused the following error message.
>> More than 8 CPUs detected and CONFIG_X86_PC cannot handle it.
>> Use CONFIG_X86_GENERICARCH or CONFIG_X86_BIGSMP.
Originally bigsmp was added just to handle >8 cpus, but now with hotplug cpu support
we need to use bigsmp mode (why? see below), that cause the above error message even 
if there were less than 8 cpus in the system.
The message is bogus, but we are cannot use logical flat mode due to issues with
broadcast IPI can confuse a CPU just comming up. We use flat physical mode just like x86_64
case. More details on why bigsmp now uses flat physical mode (vs. cluster mode)
in following link.
