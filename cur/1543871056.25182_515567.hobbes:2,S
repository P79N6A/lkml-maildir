Actually, it seems like I will run into other kinds of nasty problems
due to stupid design of the HCD code. The OHCI code #includes
the various drivers, which have a module_init each. So if you
compile PCI and SSB support, you have two module_init for one
OHCI module. Not sure how to fix this. Any idea?
