Mmm. But we also adjust the console loglevel depending upon the
verbosity of debugging info required. (And reset it when we're done).
When the nice display is on, the loglevel is 0 or 1. If a driver wants
to printk at KERN_EMERG or KERN_ALERT then, well the display should get
messed up a little :>

I did. Didn't find much. I'll look again. Perhaps I'm just blind :>

No. There's a kernel daemon - kswsuspd - that does all the hard work.
The userland process that initiates the suspend sleeps in
wait_for_completion until post resume. At boot time, we initiate the
resume via an init call. Still fine?
