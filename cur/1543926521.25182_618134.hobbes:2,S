IIRC, the present bit is ignored in the magic 4-entry PGD.  All entries 
have to be present.
What earlier CPU's did was to basically load all four values into the CPU 
when you loaded %cr3. There was no "three-level page table walker" at all: 
it was still a two-level page table walker, there were just for magic 
internal page tables that were indexed off the two high bits.
