Some things in that patch are in the same league as low latency patch. Some
things are real good and just not applied (not a big wonder as author do not
want to help here and patch as whole is completely unacceptable). But "main
thing" of Solar Designer patch is non-solution for non-problem and THAT was
discussed quite a few times @ lklm. If you'll scan archives you'll find
complete investigation. With generec schemes to convert exploits not usable
with non-executable stack in ones usable with non-executable stack.
