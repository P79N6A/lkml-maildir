Not exactly. We NEED sanity checking in kernel and we HAVE it. Just
HDIO_DRIVE_CMD is NOT kernel command. It's mere interface to IDE bus so
you can send ANY commands to IDE bus. Checking in this case DOES NOT
belong to kernel - it's HDD duty. Do we need such dangerous interface
in kernel and do we need it to be used for trivial tasks like putting
drive in sleep ? IMHO no for second question and yes for first one
(firmware upgrades can be needed not only for crackers, you know).
But if we think it's too dangerous interface to leave it in kernel at
all then Al Viro is right:
-- cut --
Umm... Which may very well mean that
        a) set of commands provided by protocol is misdesigned
        b) we would be better off if we had reasonable set of commands
(preferably the text ones) that could be written to /proc/ide/hd<x>/cmd,
so that hdparm would become an equivalent of echo [commands] >/proc...
        c) ->write() for that file doing all needed locking.
-- cut --
If we found that we have bad [dangerous] design to serve some tasks we
SHOULD NOT try to add band-iads over bad-aids (THIS is Microsoft's style
indeed). We should remove it from kernel completely (may be have code
ifdef'ed but NOT turnable via make *config) and replace it with sane
interface. Most tuning can be done with commands like
echo unmaskirq:1 > /proc/ide/hda/options
SO why not extend this interface slightly to cover also standby mode and
xfer rate ? Then set of commands in NOT unknown (we designed it!) and
we can sanity check arguments, try to prevent destructive operations, etc.

I'm not so sure. What about CD-R, scanners, video and so on ? Do we REALLY
need drivers for all this stuff in kernel ? Perhaps. But IF it's true then
proper way to fix problem is to REMOVE "raw IDE I/O" and "raw SCSI I/O"
interfaces from kernel and replace it with drivers for ALL possible IDE
and SCSI device. EVEN if it's "way to go(tm)" (I'm not so sure it is) we
can not do it for 2.4 anyway.

It is done on this basis now. It's big paradigm shift. MAY BE (just may be)
we need such a shift. But Andre's patch is not even step in this direction.
Quite an opposite.

You can do this on your router and perhaps even on your web-server. You can not
do this on desktop workstation. Not while such access is needed by XFree86.

How you can discuss design if you not even looked on it ? Gosh. Design of
proposed patch is simple: leave this dangerous "straight to hadrware" interface
in place. Do not replace it with proper interface. Just try to filter
commands send to IDE bus and allow only "good ones". Not a way to go IMO.

Not at all. If there are exist bad arguments for open(2) call (in 2.2.15 there
WERE such arguments: you can open(2) a socket and then get nasty problems with
kernel) then open(3) call should be fixed, NOT fopen(3) function in GLibC.
If ability to push ANY packet to network is dangerous then protect it with
capability and give sane interface for normally used (TCP/IP) packets.
That's how kernel is designed. If you want band-aids to avoid the "obvious"
holes... you know where to find it.

Not exactly. Userspace has beed give MANY nukes in Linux. Especially for
root. But it's just stupid to give userspace nuke and THEN try to prevent
misuse of that nuke. THIS is Microsoft way indeed. If this nuke with full
power is not needed in userspace then why to give it in first place ? If
(when) it is NEEDED in userspace in full glory and uglyness (when you want
to upgrade firmware for real :-) it's needed there and we should not try to
second-guess if it's needed there for real.

  1. GENERIC kernel drive can not handle it.
  2. We are allowing "raw I/O IDE bus" or refusing it. Filtering is just wrong
approach. If you need some things to be done with IDE device (change in xfer
mode, standby/sleep, Seagate auto-standby regulation, etc) driver should
provide sane interafaces for such needs (BTW it can check is you are trying
to disable auto-standby with Seagate-specific command on Seagate and not
on WD :-)

It IS genuine feature. If we need such feature or not is other question
entirely.
