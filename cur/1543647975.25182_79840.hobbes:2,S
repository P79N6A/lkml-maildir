Bug in apm vs O1-scheduler. The apm task is moved from processor 0.
I took the fix from -ac tree. Just diff kernel/apm.c from -mm and from
-ac. That worked for me for 2.4 kernels. Perhaps 2.5 needs some additional
fix in other files. (err, I suppose that fix is in Alan's 2.5 tee also...)
Hope this helps.
Anyways, patch for 2.4 attached. I suppose it won't apply on 2.5, but you
can try...
