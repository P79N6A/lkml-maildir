Can someone tell me the flow of code for these two scenarios -
I write disk to /sys/power/state. How does system go to hibernation? How
does this trigger ACPI driver functions?
I issue shutdown command.
I am using 2.6.18 kernel.
Thanks,
Lomesh

Please tell me what kernel version you're referring to.

Sorry, I have misunderstood your post (the "now" doesn't look as a part
of the
command).
