Note that this is how it's supposed to always work, except you should 
replace "Linus" with "any maintainer".
At any point in the chain, you should always have to worry only about the
"immediate predecessor". That's why the certificate is "recursive", ie if
the immediate predecessor signed off, then you can always sign off
yourself, without worrying about any history, and you've done the "right
thing".
