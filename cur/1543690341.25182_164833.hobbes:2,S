Alan,
thanks for replying so quickly!

Yes, we are working with several versions (rh-8.0, rh-9.0, as2.1, el3.0a2), and 
would like to support all of them. If this was for internal use, we would just 
go to the most up-to-date version, but sometimes customers are reluctant to 
upgrade (don't ask, I am not a marketing person :-))))

Just NFS mounts. This is how we do PXE install: download vmlinuz and an initial 
initrd.img image. vmlinuz uncompresses, allocates a RAM disk and mounts 
initrd.img where it finds the modules necessary to carry on (tg3 driver amongst 
them), then it nfs mount a directory from the install server (something like 
/tftp/install/this_release/images/ where it would find configurastion files and 
images for the install) and it is this MOUNT request that, if the reply gets 
lost, starts the storm.
You said you already saw a similar report of this. Is this logged somewhere?
Again, Thanks very much.
Marco
