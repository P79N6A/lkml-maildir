So, uh, where do I get git? Where is your "git repository" and Linus' "git
repository" and how do I set that up?
Or, at least, where do I find all this info?
I take it it's not this:

Description: GNU Interactive Tools, a file browser/viewer and process viewer/killer
 git (GNU Interactive Tools) is a set of interactive text-mode tools,
 closely integrated with the shell.  It contains an extensible file
 system browser, an ascii/hex file viewer, a process viewer/killer and
 some other related utilities and shell scripts.  It can be used to
 increase the speed and efficiency of most of the daily tasks such as
 copying and moving files and directories, invoking editors,
 compressing and uncompressing files, creating and expanding archives,
 compiling programs, sending mail, etc.  It looks nice, has colors (if
 the standard ANSI color sequences are supported) and is user-friendly.
 .
 One of the main advantages of Git is its flexibility.  It is not
 limited to a given set of commands.  The configuration file can be
 easily enhanced, allowing the user to add new commands or file
 operations, depending on its needs or preferences.
