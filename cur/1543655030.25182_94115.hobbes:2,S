Indeed.  Think about a 16-byte descriptor in a 32-byte cache line.
The net chip has written status information to the first word, you've
just written to the 4th word of that cache line.
To access the status word written by the chip, you need to invalidate
(without writeback) that cache line.  For the chip to access the word
you've just written, you need to writeback that cache line.
In other words, you _will_ loose information in this case, guaranteed.
I'd rather keep our existing pci_* API than be forced into this crap
again.
