This is probabbly because you're using the referenced xbindkeys trick to
delete the button11/12 event. Unfortunately, binding 11/12 while cruise
control is enabled also obscures the first scroll event.
The horrible-ugly-very-nasty-workaround is to bind that event to a
command that re-simulates the up/down click. I've attached a piece of C
code that'll do that. ('./click 4' will simulate button 4 going up and
down.)

I'm sort of guessing at the xbindkeys setting for this. Myself, i've
performed this bind event in my openbox configuration.
This still doesn't catch the button 11/12 mouse-up event, although that
doesn't seem to bother many applications
