I just sent a patch with a lot of compile breakages so I'm feeling
quite embarrassed here but when the patch is touching this low in arch
code, I don't think small four configuration build isn't too much
before sending out a patchset.  With two quad core machines and ram
disk configured, it just doesn't take that much of time (which BTW
doesn't cost that much these days).  With my typical test config,
whole build takes about 80 to 90 seconds.  Four times that is still
under ten minutes.
Anyways, it's a balancing act.  Four small builds don't sound like too
much to me.  Hey, if you're okay with it.  :-)
Thanks.
