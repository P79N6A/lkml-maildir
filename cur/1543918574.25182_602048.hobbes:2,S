Yeah the fastpath vs. slow path is not the issue as Siddha and I concluded 
earlier. Seems that we are mainly seeing cacheline bouncing due to two 
cpus accessing meta data in the same page struct. The patches in 
MM that are scheduled to be merged for .24 address that issue. I 
have repeatedly asked that these patches be tested. The patches were 
posted months ago.

I thought Siddha has a test in the works with the per cpu structure 
patchset from MM? Could you sync up with Siddha?
