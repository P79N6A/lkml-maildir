it exists in 2.6.15 and I see no changes in 2.6.16-rc1 except for 
cosmetics :(
checked the git tree, dput() etc. the bug is definetely still here - 
nothing changed in this area.
Sorry for bad news.
The patch can be probably remade via introducing "notlocked_refs" 
counter on dentry. if shrinker()/umount() see such a dentry() with 
non-zero refcnt it can sleep as it is done in current patch. It would be 
a little bit cleaner/simpler. What do you think?
If someone suggest any brilliant/helpfull idea I would be happy to 
improve it.
Kirill
