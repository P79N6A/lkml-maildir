ZONE_DMA is out of whack.  It shouldn't be, and I'm not aware of anyone
getting in and working out why.  I certainly wouldn't want to go and add
all this stuff without having a good understanding of _why_ it's out of
whack.  Perhaps it's just some silly bug, like the thing I pointed at in
the previous email.
