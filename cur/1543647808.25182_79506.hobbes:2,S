Right.

I've been thinking along the exact same lines. I even started to
implement something like this originally, but ended up doing a simpler
save/restore thing in oprofile. It would be fairly easy to implement,
the biggest difficulty being the hand-off of the power management
routines and the NMI handler where appropriate.
I agree that it doesn't make sense to split up the resources (though at
some point I'd like to maintain the watchdog functionality even with
oprofile running). In fact, for now, I think the simple exclusive CONFIG
solution is the simplest - the things don't get on together, after all.
