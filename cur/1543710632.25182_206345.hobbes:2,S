These functions are indeed in 2.6.3 and 2.6.4 -- and they work fine. If you
have any questions related to them, please ask me.

Minor correction: only the first and last steps are indeed used to handle
_PPC, IIRC.
Also, you'll have
- support for _PDC, if needed
- proper embedding into ACPI core
- the /proc/acpi/processor/./performance interface which some still tend to
   like...
