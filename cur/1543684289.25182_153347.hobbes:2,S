Right. I have 1.5 GB and can reproduce the problem.
And 'append mem=512M' in lilo made things works nicely too.

In fact, last week I had such bad warm reboots that I opened the box and 
all of a sudden everythings was working fine again.
So I would say I have a problem of low power supply or fan. And I think 
I have read some post about it in the past:
[System Starvation under heavy io load with HIGHMEM4G]
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0303.2/1435.html
[Tyan 2460/Dual Athlon MP hangs]
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0207.0/0040.html
Eventhought I have a Tyan S2460, I read that:
[The Thunder K7 is an Extended ATX board, measuring 12 × 13 inches. It 
only supports Registered DDR PC1600/2100 memory, so your old DIMMs won't 
work. Your old power supply won't work either. The Thunder K7 needs an 
extra 8-pin power connector. It's not the same extra power connector 
that Intel Pentium 4 Xeon-based motherboards need either, so you must 
get a special power supply that currently only will work with this one 
board.]

What do you think of it ?
Here is my uptime:
$ uptime
   5:15pm  up 3 days,  3:18, 13 users,  load average: 0.08, 0.25, 0.21
And I have been running rather heavy jobs ('make -j') with a lot of IO...
One final thing, I am pretty novice at those things, so please 
appologize if I said something completely dumb.
my 2 cents,
mathieu
