Hi,
I'm getting periodic oopses running KVM-33 on 2.6.23-rc1. Here is a digital 
photo of the oops. Alarmingly, a lot of the time it triple faults the machine 
and I don't get a chance to grab it. This time I was lucky, though.

Unfortunately, some of the oops text scrolled out of the screen. I will 
endeavour to reproduce the bug over serial console, but I can make no 
guarantees.
The CPU is an AMD X2 BE-2350, chipset is AMD 690G.
