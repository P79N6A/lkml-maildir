Ok, I'll drop it.  Any objections to me doing this?
So, with the remaining pci patches, (as seen in
kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/gregkh-2.6/patches/pci/) are
there any objections to me pushing these (with the exception of the
above one) to Linus?  I think there was one report of the
pci-assign-unassigned-resources.patch patch causing boot problems on one
box, but that might have also been due to the above patch, am not sure.
Ah, the joys of acpi and pci resources... bleah.
thanks,
