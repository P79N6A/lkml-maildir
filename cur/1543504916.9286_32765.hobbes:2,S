They're different things.
Regardless of committing to stable storage, write atomicity can be used
for database synchronisation between clients.  Of course any sensible
client would synchronise on a single byte... I don't know if any real
applications depend on atomic writes.

And atomicity isn't specified for NFSv3 either.
