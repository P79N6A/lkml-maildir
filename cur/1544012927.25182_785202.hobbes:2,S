You can't prevent a local root user from accessing cached data: that's
true with or without cachefs. root can typically access the data
using /dev/kmem, swap, intercepting tty traffic, spoofing user creds,...
If root can't be trusted, then find another machine.
The worry is rather that privileged daemons may be tricked into
revealing said data to unprivileged users, or that unprivileged users
may attempt to read data from files to which they have no rights using
the cachefs itself. That is a problem that is addressable by means of
LSM, and is what David has attempted to solve.
