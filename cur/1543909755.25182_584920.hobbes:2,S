I don't recall what specifically went wrong when we were using select
in there, but it was pretty ugly.
We're hitting more and more problems with this "select is
broken"-versus-"depends-on user inferface sucks" problem.  I do think that
a suitable fix could be found at the user interface level: show the
"cpusets" option to the user, but don't let them select it.  Instead, tell
the user what needs to be enabled so they can access this option.
But I haven't seen the slightest sign of anyone thinking about doing
anything along those lines.
