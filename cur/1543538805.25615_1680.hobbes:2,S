On completing chat script (modem connection to ISP):
pppd[646]: Serial connection established.
pppd[646]: Using interface ppp0
pppd[646]: Connect: ppp0 <--> /dev/modem
pppd[646]: default route ioctl(SIOCADDRT): Network is unreachable(101)
pppd[646]: local  IP address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
pppd[646]: remote IP address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
Using 2.4.0-test4-pre6 (but problem has been present since test2, and maybe
before) and the latest version of pppd.
"route add default gw ppp0" gives the same 101 error.
PPP and Async modem support where compiled in kernel (havnt tried modular).
Using same script & pppd version give no probs under 2.2.14.
