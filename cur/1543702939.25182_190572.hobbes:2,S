Hi Andrew,
following this mail, I'll send the following three patches that have 
accumulated in my better i386 CPU selection patch (but don't depend on 
it):
[1/3] gcc 2.95 supports -march=k6 (no need for check_gcc)
[2/3] added Pentium M and Pentium-4 M options
[3/3] AMD Elan is a different subarch
Please apply
Adrian
