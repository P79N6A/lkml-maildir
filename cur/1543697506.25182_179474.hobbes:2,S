I can't help you there.

Swap space is really just special case of disk caching.  Many pages
will be backed by regular files, such as the text segment of most
processes.  Swap is used for pages that don't have a corresponding
disk file.  Not configuring any swap is perfectly normal, and
shouldn't cause any problems.  After all, swap is normally enabled by
some system boot script, so it has to be able to start without any
swap space.  For the record, I've been running without swap for a long
time on a system with enough real RAM.
