Some time-outs are enforced by hardware, some errors even result in
a bus reset in which all the devices reload their firmware, etc.
Therefore time-outs are made quite long so one has to wait for a
relatively long to either retry or to give up upon an error. It
is possible to dynamically determine the kind of time-out necessary
for a particular error in a particular device. This could be
determined, for instance, when a device is mounted or otherwise
first accessed. However, then there would be complaints about
the amount of time necessary to mount a device, etc.
So, basically, the compromise seems to be that bad devices or
bad media result in long-time retries.
Note, if you have another task, that is not trying to use the
errored device or its bus, it does not get starved for CPU time.
The kernel still sleeps while waiting for pass/fail interrupts,
therefore giving the CPU to somebody. Of course this doesn't
help the task that's accessing the device, and to that task the
system seems to, as you say, come to a near halt. 
FYI "Dr. Death" is phony and email to that node gets bounced.
