userfs
I don't much see the need for anything else, and I don't think
the kernel should be bloated by something that can be done in
userland very easily.  Next, people will want to put the Netscape
new layout engine into the kernel, so it runs faster, and opens
HTML files transparently without the app needing to know that it
is an HTML file...
No thanks, my kernel is good enough coming in at < 1Mb.
