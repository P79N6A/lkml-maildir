It's unusual for a memory allocate/free function to not be IRQ-safe.  Will
there never be a requirement that mq_free() or mq_alloc() be called from
interrupts or softirq's?

You've religiously used the wrong coding style throughout these patches:
neither core kernel nor arch/arm places a space before the opening paren. 
A little thing, but easy to get right.
There are eight-spaces where tabs should be in various places too..
