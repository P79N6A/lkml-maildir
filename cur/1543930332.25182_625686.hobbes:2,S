> To that end, this patch series differs from v6 in significant ways:

>  * syslets are initiated by providing syslet arguments to sys_indirect().
> 
>  * uatoms, threadlets, and the kaio changes are postponed until they can be
>    justified and rebuilt on more complete infrastructure.  (I'm not saying
>    these shouldn't or won't be persued.  I'm saying that we should get the
>    simplest piece working first.)

>  * the code is clarified and commented, the patches are bisectable and pass
