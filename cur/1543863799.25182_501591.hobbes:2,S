Well, this is true only as long as all applications running in the
system are graded equally and it is kernel's job to provide the best
of the system resources to all applications.

The current reclaim code does a good job based on the assumption that
pages belonging to different applications have equal priority.  The
aging of the page is independent of application's priority or class.
This is good for best overall system performance.
The new use case that is challenging this assumption is the fact that
application groups fall into different class on the same system and
there is a need to make certain class perform better at the cost of
certain other class of applications.  In this scenario system
performance is not judged by overall average throughput, but by
performance of certain class of applications only.
A backup job running in the database server can take any amount of
performance hit to marginally improve database performance since that
is what the users care about.  We would run into similar situations
when running various virtualization and consolidation solutions.

Well, we may need to use both the approach.  Hints with
madvise/fadvise is definitely a good approach and the kernel should
take these hints aggressively. Yet even with these hints we may want
to have limits in the interest of other applications that do not use
pagecache.
System wide limit to pagecache may not sound very interesting, but if
we think about 'containers' and group of process having such limits it
will have more practical use cases.  An aggregation of process having
 limit on pagecache would give relative importance to certain class of
pages during page replacement.  Controlling limits among group of
applications will help achieve peak application performance with the
applications that we care about.
