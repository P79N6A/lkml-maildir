Valdis,
These permission checks are based on the receiving socket security
context, not any process security context, and are performed by the
sock_rcv_skb hook when mediating packet receipt on a socket.  The
auxiliary pid and comm or exe information is meaningless for such
checks.  avc_audit could possibly be modified to check whether we are in
softirq and omit them in those cases from the audit messages.  This has
been discussed previously on the selinux mailing list, please see the
archives.
