Exactly the same downside as with suid/guid to root shell scripts:
An exploit is possible where someone can gain that userid
running something other than the shell script.  Such
as a generic shell.
If you need this - use the trivial workaround:
A short c program that runs that particular shell script, and passes
parameters on to it.  compile it and make it setuid. 
There should be some safety checks in that program, such as verifying
the script.
