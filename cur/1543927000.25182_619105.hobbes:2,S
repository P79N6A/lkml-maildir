Hi Ingo,
	I would prefer this to go in 2.6.24 if possible. 2.6.24 would be the
first kernel to support a group scheduler in its entirety (user interface +
related support in scheduler) and also that works reasonably well :) It would 
also give me early test feedback.

From my inspection, here are the changes introduced by this patch
for !CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED case:
- inc/dec_load() takes a load input instead of task pointer input as their
  2nd arg
- inc/dec_nr_running don't call inc/dec_load. Instead,
- enqueue/dequeue_task class callbacks call inc/dec_load
- [Unintended/will-fix change] min/max tunables added in
  /proc/sys/kernel
All of above changes (except last, which I will fix) should have zero
functional+runtime effect for !CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED case. So I don't see how
I can split Patch 2/2 further.
Or do you prefer I introduce #ifdef's such that even these minor changes to 
inc/dec_load are avoided for !CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED case? That would
make the code slightly ugly I suspect.
