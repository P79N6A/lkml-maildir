I recently got the same mainboard and it works fine for me with CD
reading/writing (LG CDRW, no DVD drive). Just tried yesterday, wrote a
CD at speed 12 and then read it as fast as it could and I did not notice
anything wrong. I'm using PS/2 keyboard and mouse and a very recent git
kernel (2.6.17-rc6+...). Maybe the CD speed is not enough to trigger it.
Are you sure DMA was on?
