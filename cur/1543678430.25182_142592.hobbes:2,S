This is very strange address to oops on.

And the EIP is prior to kernel start which is also very strange.
On the other hand the address c0192df4 is somewhere inside reiserfs code,
so it looks like a single bit error, I'd say.
Can you run memtest86 for some time to verify that your RAM is OK?
(hm, and the oops got twice to the logs which is pretty strange thing, too,
never seen anything like this).
Bye,
