Percentage of CPU time is not a useful measurement.
Think about it.. if I/O were infinitely fast, then CPU usage
would be 100%, since the CPU would never have to wait.
If disk I/O were infinitely slow, CPU usage would be 0%,
but that's not a Good Thing, is it..
Cycle/instruction counts would be useful, if available.
