I think I disagree with Andew here.  Having a core patch separate
from a new drivers/filesystem/etc.. is always a good idea.  It makes
reviewing a lot easier and allows independant handling, e.g. merging it
earlier than the new driver for some reason - as happened for example
with the clear_inode changes we needed earlier for ocfs or the pagevec
exports that came in via the reiser4 patches but were needed in mainline
for cifs now.
