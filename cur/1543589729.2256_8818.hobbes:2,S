Why ? debug=7 is the highest debug level and produces _lots_ of debug data
for high network activity. Do you have problems when insmod-ing without
any option and use a higher debug level just to see what's going on?

Why do you believe that the card/driver is responsible for the freeze ?
The outputs that you provided show no problems to me.
A duplex mismatch would not freeze a computer. You would get crappy
transfer rates, usually some error messages from the driver, but
everything should otherwise work. To verify the media settings, you might
want to use mii-diag (from ftp.scyld.com).
