 Hi Jakob,
i've looked at your sources and i wonder
 why you use "return _RGB_ or _YUV_ data in
 read() mode"....
 better find use VIDIOCSPICT to find out what
 the program wants
 YUV...or .. RGB
 then have an internal video_picture
 and change the palette in there
 
then in your read() function
 simply query the cam->vpic.palette
 and decide wheter to read YUV or RGB
 
Bye
  Bye
   Niko
