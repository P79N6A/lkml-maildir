It's a shame for the people not using distros, since they need to first
experience the suspend failure, then google around for a solution, find
the patch, etc. That is a shame, since it could have worked out of the
box since 2.6.12 at least.
And it's a shame because it causes extra work for me everytime we update
the SUSE kernel :-)
