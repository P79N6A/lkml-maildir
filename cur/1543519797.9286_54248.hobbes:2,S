from a brief look at mm/* it would seem that page->index at least lives 
in the same "universe" as the old offset field, but if you figure out 
exactly the difference, can you please also update the include/linux/mm.h 
to explain it (it currently talks about page->offset which does not 
exist)
Regards,
Tigran.
