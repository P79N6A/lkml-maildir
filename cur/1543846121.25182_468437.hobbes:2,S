Funny - I started doing the exact same thing here just eight hours ago. 
I'll send you anything which isn't in that git tree, thanks.

I think we should merge that and use it.  No overhead, self-documenting,
easily greppable for.
The downsides are that it muckies up the source a little and introduces a
very small risk that real use-uninitialised bugs will be hidden.  But I
believe the benefit outweighs those disadvantages.
