You load up and bloat the SCSI layer the special function to do the
taskfile iops, however since the exported ioctl to permit outside the
driver to grant access has been deleted, you have to add more bloat in
scsi.
The result is having to stagger scsi's queuing layer to deal with
overlap protocols that differ enough to cause major headaches.  But this
is 2.5 so bring out the wrecking balls and give SCSI equal time.
