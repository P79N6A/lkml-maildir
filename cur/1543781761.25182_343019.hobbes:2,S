Since the itanium off loads a lot of its instruction steam decisions on 
to the compiler(s), where other processors just do it, one might argue 
that you can not even characterize the itanium without bundling in the 
compilers...
Not to say that is wrong but just to make it clear that saying the 
itanium speed is <X> is like saying that a cummings diesel is fast with 
out saying what sort of car/truck it is mounted in.
