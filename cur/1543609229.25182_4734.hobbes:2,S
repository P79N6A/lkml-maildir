Not really - just an implementation issue.  At one point (long ago) I had
started putting in support for this.  However, the consensus is that some
people will still want to use the less complex ext2 code instead of ext3
that pretends to be ext2.  I imagine that eventually support for mounting
unjournaled ext2 filesystems with the ext3 driver will be added, but there
is no pressing need - you can always use the ext2 driver.  Yes, it takes
a bit more memory to have both loaded, but most people who switch to ext3
don't use ext2 filesystems anymore anyways.
Cheers, Andreas
