Sure, but from what I can see this bug appears unrelated to the one in
kernel bugzilla #7781 that we've been discussing the past few days.
First of all, the nf conntrack paths won't be used by normal
users until 2.6.20-rc1 or so.  The bz #7781 report is against
2.6.19 and all those backtraces have IP conntrack in them, not
nf conntrack.
So what are we compiling with here btw, gcc-4.1?
I want to rule the compiler out in this and the bz #7781 case
so that we can look at the code seriously.
