But vbetool can only handle primary cards, can't it?

I had a patch sometime before, vm86d.  It's a daemon in userspace that
accepts requests from the kernel which executes x86 instructions using
lrmi, then pushes the result back to the kernel.  I modified vesafb
so that it uses this daemon which makes vesafb acquire the capability
to do on the fly mode switching (similar in functionality with
vesafb-tng which uses a different method).
I abandoned this patch, but it seems there's might be at least one user.
