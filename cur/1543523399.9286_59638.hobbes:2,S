I have checked them all out (including a similar case within i2c-core.c),
and applied fixes in our master archive. They will be propagated to 
the kernel tree in at most a few days (also depending on Alan Cox' speed, 
of course). In the meantime, desperate people can use our CVS
archive (anon@penn.netroedge.com:/home/cvs, directory i2c, password anonymous)
Thanks for your help,
  Frodo
PS Things are not as bad as you might think; at several places, we
   call verify_area instead of checking the return code of
   copy_{to,from}_user. As far as I know, this should also guard
   against possible faults.
