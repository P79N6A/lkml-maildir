Well, 'Documentation/devices.txt' says:
  THE DEVICE REGISTRY IS OFFICIALLY FROZEN FOR LINUS TORVALDS' KERNEL
  TREE.  At Linus' request, no more allocations will be made official
  for Linus' kernel tree; the 3 June 2001 version of this list is the
  official final version of this registry.
So placing it in /proc doesn't seem to me such a bad idea.

This would break the assumption that no requests can be received until
the filesystem is mounted.
