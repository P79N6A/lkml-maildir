on a related topic,
i notice that try_to_read_ahead (used by both mmap and normal file reads)
will add a page to the page cache and read it in if it isn't already in
the cache.  but it won't update a page if the page is already in the
cache, but is not up to date.
does anyone know why ?  as an experiment i've changed it to update pages
that aren't up to date, and noticed a performance improvement for mmaps,
but a performance degradation for file reads.
