So the practical difference between finding a file in a hierarchy if you  
already know the first N characters (because you need them to find the  
subdirectory it's in), and finding the same file in a flat directory still  
knowing the first N characters, is ... well, maybe tab completion is a tad  
slower.
Sorry, but I can't see the human angle.
