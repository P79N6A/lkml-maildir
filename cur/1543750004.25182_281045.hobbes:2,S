Not to hand, its under the retired chipset stuff. The details are as
follows from memory
When you read one 8bit value from an 8254 timer the values latch for
read so that when you read the other half of the 16bit value you get the
value from the moment of the first read. On 
neptune that didn't work right so you got halves of two differing
samples. That means the error would be worst case a bit under 300 (257
for the wrap + a few for timing)
