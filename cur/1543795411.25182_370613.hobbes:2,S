Subject: 2.6.14-rt13: high res timer problem?

Hi guys
I noticed an odd problem with 2.6.14-rt13 this past week.  If the new-ish
high resolution timer is enabled (not HPET), sleeps take far too long.
For example, "sleep 1" from bash actually delays 38 seconds, not 1 second
as expected.  I've also noticed that the clock on the computer seems to
run slow, but I haven't looked into that in any detail yet.
At the present moment I am running Ingo's rt13 patch with 2.6.14.  I have
not yet had a chance to test an unpatched 2.6.14 - I will try to get to
that soon.  I've also got 2.6.14-rt15 now and I'll test that too.
This is on a Centrino laptop with an i915 chipset.  I can confirm that the
effect persists irrespective of whether any or all of the APIC options are
selected.  The presence or absence of various timer-related options
(ktimers, HPET, PM timer) also don't appear to make any difference.
Please CC replies to me to ensure I see them.  Thanks.
Regards
  jonathan
