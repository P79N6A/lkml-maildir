I hate to be the squeaky wheel here, but the attached patch is not 100%

This should instead be:
#define EP_MAX_MSTIMEO min(1000ULL * MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT / HZ, (LONG_MAX - 999ULL) / HZ)
Here's why:
We want to avoid overflow of (timeout * HZ + 999), or, in other words,
the case where (timeout * HZ + 999) >= LONG_MAX
Unwrapping the equation, we get timeout >= (LONG_MAX - 999) / HZ
The original code isn't _wrong_, but more restrictive than it should be.
In any case, better to fix up the base patch now, before all the other
patches go in. I could do this, or Davide can... it's all good. :-)
