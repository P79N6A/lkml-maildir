I did this in my local tree but decided for a different directory name.
Usage of modpost would conflict with the modpost binary and I suspected
that some systems would not allow this clash.
I do not expect people to run make mrproper before applying a patch..
The new directory name is: scripts/mod - also signalling that this can be
used for other module related utilities in the future.
