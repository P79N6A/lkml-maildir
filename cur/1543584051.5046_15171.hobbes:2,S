	I presume the aicasm (or whatever) can do its meager DB needs
	by simpler ubiquitous things like  GDBM.   SleepyCat DBx is good,
	but in this case as serious overkill as e.g. using Oracle ;)
	(No, I didn't read the source of the aicasm.)
	There really should be some convenient way to compile the firmware
	from source when wanted, but the normal case should not be dependent
	of FIRMWARE SOURCE - the integer/byte array include file should
	be enough for normal users.
		$ (cd drivers/xx/yy; make aic7xxx.fw )
	What HOSTCC et.al. settings are needed, that I can't say,
	and that 'make' method doesn't get top-level definitions in...
	Simultaneously (as 'aic7xxx.fw' would not be the real filename),
	aic7xxx.o file's dependencies would contain the real firmware
	files so that "make bzImage" will recompile it correctly.
	When people like Justin are sending the driver update to Linus,
	they just need to be carefull at sending all relevant files/diffs.
	We are placing a lot of trust to these firmware makers to supply
	us working firmware, why not trust them to do it right so that
	compiling kernel won't need to generate firmware assembler program
	at first...
