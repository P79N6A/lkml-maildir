Linux does NOT provide any PC-BIOS interrupts of any kind. Linux uses the
BIOS only for booting, after which it does everything for itself.
If you have a watchdog timer running off an interrupt, that software
is broken and broken in the worse way.
Yes you CAN disable the watchdog. It is disabled automatically when
a reset occurs. Patch your bad BIOS that accesses the timer. If
it is never accessed, it will never time-out and therefore it will
never reboot the machine.
