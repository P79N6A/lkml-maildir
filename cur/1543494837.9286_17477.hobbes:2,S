How does one configure the sound card settings (IRQ, DMA, etc.) for the PAS-16
sound card for kernel 2.2.7 using menu-config? I don't see a menu item for that
anywhere. I compiled the kernel without doing those settings, but /dev/sndstat
didn't show any devices loaded, other than the system timer. HELP!!!

P.S. Is it possible to release a kernel archive that has only i386 support,
to decrease the time required to download the monster? I will never use the
Alpha or MIPS or 68K or whatever support. Just the i386. Thanks!
