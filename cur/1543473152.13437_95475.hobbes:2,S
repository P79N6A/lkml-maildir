	You mean 'vm_offset' field ?
	There are 37 files with (sub)string 'vm_offset' in them.
	Changeing its type from current  loff_t  to  pgoff_t  would
	help finding its instances, I guess.  (And thus ease locating
	places using it for page (non-)aligned things.)
	That part about "a greater chunk" I don't understand, though.
