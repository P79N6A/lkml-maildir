Linus, please pull the latest scheduler git tree from:
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mingo/linux-2.6-sched.git
three bugfixes:
- a nice fix from eagle-eye Oleg for a subtle typo in the balancing
  code, the effect of this bug was more agressive idle balancing. This
  bug was introduced by one of the original CFS commits.
- a round of global->static fixes from Adrian Bunk - this change,
  besides the cleanup effect, chops 100 bytes off sched.o.
- Peter Zijlstra noticed a sleeper-bonus bug. I kept this patch under
  observation and testing this past week and saw no ill effects so far. 
  It could fix two suspected regressions. (It could improve Kasper
  Sandberg's workload and it could improve the sleeper/runner
  problem/bug Roman Zippel was seeing.)
test-built and test-booted on x86-32 and x86-64, and did a dozen of 
randconfig builds for good measure (which uncovered two new build errors 
in latest -git).
Thanks,
	Ingo
