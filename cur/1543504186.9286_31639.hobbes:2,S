I'm booting machines as a diskless machine so modules won't do me any good. 
/ is nfs mounted.  I copyied the file to the place in the kernel and I'm
hoping for the best atm.
Why hasn't the one from that ftp site in the kernel?  I noticed that even in
2.3.11 it hasn't changed since 2.2.0  I don't know how far back it was since
the earliest kernel I have is 2.2.0 on this machine.
