Actually I think John's problem was that the usb core code has now
_stopped_ doing this byteswapping, and he has a lsusb which is hacked to
expect it. So if you apply my patch you're preserving the userspace ABI
by reverting to the extremely stupid behaviour of byteswapping _some_ of
the fields in the descriptor we pass to userspace.
