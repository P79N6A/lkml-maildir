Yes, so I was thinking of treating it with a pseudo driver that could save and 
restore just that portion of the page.
Regarding the allocation, I was originally thinking of that other ACPI 
allocation while atomic issue, and trying to avoid another one. I guess this 
is simpler though because we know ahead of time how much is needed (am I 
right in thinking that in the other case, the amount of memory needed isn't 
known ahead of time?).
