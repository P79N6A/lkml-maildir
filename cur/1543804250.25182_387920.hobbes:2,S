Why does running the following command cause processes to be killed:
	dd if=/dev/zero of=/u/u1/andyc/tmpfile bs=1M count=8k
And I noticed one of my windows disappeared. Further investigation
showed that was my terminator window (java based app: see
http://software.jessies.org/terminator/
). I found this in my syslog:
Jan 17 11:12:58 boco kernel: Out of Memory: Killed process 16498 (java).
My hardware: amd64 based machine (ASUS A8V Deluxe motherboard) with 4Gb
of memory.
My kernel: debian package linux-image-2.6.15-1-amd64-k8 package
installed. IE its running 2.6.15 compiled for amd64.
This is repeatable. The above dd command also causes the machine to
become very unresponsive (eg windows don't focus).
