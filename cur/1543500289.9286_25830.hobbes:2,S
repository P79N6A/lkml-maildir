	Yes, it is half-decent one.
	... no, actually not even that, see below.
	I would like to see call numbers and entry vector diffs for
	Alpha, SPARCs, MIPSes, ... as well.

	I do find this thing a bit surprising, I had thought we already
	had this facility in the kernel ???  Perhaps not then ?
	Changeing f_op field in the associated 'struct file' to point
	to the revocation file operations set(s) would be the easiest way.
	One way is shown at the  drivers/char/tty_io.c  with the way
	how hungup is handled by changeing the filp->f_op field.
	Another approach would be to pick the 'inode' from below the file,
	and then call   make_bad_inode(inode)  at it.
	Basically the idea is to ruin the file completely, and the only
	f_op operation doable to the file is close().  All others yield
	-EIO.
	Also, less multiprocessing hazards at the change of f_op, when
	compared to going in and calling filp_close() at all files which
	get same "kill" treatment...
