Well I've been trying it out once more, because the first time I was more 
or less in hurry, so I almost straightaway booted in to one of my spare
kernels.
It could be that it got totally past the video4linux stuff, it leaves no
clear error code on where the fault appeared. For the output (hand to
write it down by hand, system really was dead) look below.
Maybe it past it, looking at pre7 the next step would be the loopback
device and afterwards IDE detection. I hope somebody sees where it goes
wrong, cause it's got me puzzled.
Last messages before error:
