Hello, I have another (probably stupid) problem.  A server is running
a Micronics M6Me mainboard with integrated SCSI.  I want to add extra
drive(s) into a RAID0 of aging Seagate Elite 9GB `bricks', and thought
that I might make do with a 7200rpm Fujitsu MPE (13GB UDMA-66) as the
third drive in the RAID, perhaps in a RAID-4.  It is only after being
all done with the backing-up, re-set-up, and so on that I realised the
unfortunate fact that the M6Me, like earlier server boards such as the
SuperMicro P6DOF, has its IDE drives connected to the ISA bus -- good
for maybe 1.5 MB/s in PIO mode, no DMA.  No problem, said I, I have a
Promise PCI UDMA66 controller lying around.  In it went and I was able
to find and set up with my Fujitsu as /dev/hde on the ide2 interface.
But OUCH!! when I try to do enable DMA, I get this:
[root@titania /root]# /sbin/hdparm -d 1 /dev/hde
/dev/hde:
 setting using_dma to 1 (on)
 HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Operation not permitted
 using_dma    =  0 (off)
[root@titania /root]# /sbin/hdparm -i /dev/hde
/dev/hde:

 IORDY=yes, tPIO={min:120,w/IORDY:120}, PIO modes: mode3 mode4

Can someone point to a reason why enabling DMA might fail?  I'd been
under the impression that UDMA-66 controllers offer all functionality
of common IDE DMA controllers, plus more.  I tried this starting with
the IDE interfaces disabled or enabled, no difference.  THANKS!
