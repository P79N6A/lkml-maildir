Blackmailing volunteers is not the way to go. This just
creates bad blood and certainly will not result in better
cooperation. You will just lose good programmers (btw. AFAIK
none of the ISDN-core developers even participated in this
thread). And I doubt you could get SuSE to do what you want. 
If the ISDN developers decide to go on strike SuSE would be 
in serious trouble. In 1998 there were more ISDN cards than 
traditional modems sold in Germany.
So, alianating the people who actually do this important
work is plain and simply wrong. If you don't like the way 
they are doing things, you are free to look for an alternative
code base (I doubt you will get one that even plays in the
same league as the current isdn4linux).
Trying to force your will on somebody else who is volunteering 
his spare time will not work and you should know this. You
already lost some very good programmers through this attitude
(not to speak of the sentiments you created in the gcc team
by calling them names when they disagree with your world view).
