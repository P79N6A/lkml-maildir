My mistake; I didn't understand slabinfo very well at the time... and
(embarassingly enough) that was related to my piping the output to a file
(in order to do a diff later) rather than a regularly-occurring phenomenon.
As for my memory leak problem, I did finally track it down to the
kernel-preemption patch... my best guess is that it interacts poorly with
some of our platform-specific modifications... though what I can't figure
out is why even with preemption disabled (in menuconfig), I still have the
problem.  I'm looking through the patch again to try to find additions that
aren't #ifdef'd out when it's disabled, but I have a feeling that since I've
found a way to fix the problem, I'll be moving on to other things soon.
<sigh>
Anyway, thanks to everyone who offered advice, and if any kernel preemption
experts want to set me straight, feel free!
