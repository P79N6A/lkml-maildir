Francois:
You should look at
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4944
This appears to be almost exactly the same as your problem, even though
the motherboard is completely different.  Instead of starting a new bug
report of your own, just add your address to the CC: list for this bug and
add a comment summarizing your experiences.
