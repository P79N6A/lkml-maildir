I tried that.
In file included from arch/i386/mm/pgtable.c:11:
include/linux/swap.h:82: warning: ‘__used__’ attribute ignored
In file included from include/linux/suspend.h:8,
                 from init/do_mounts.c:7:
include/linux/swap.h:82: warning: ‘__used__’ attribute ignored
In file included from arch/i386/mm/init.c:22:

  AS      arch/i386/kernel/vsyscall-sysenter.o
etc..
and doesn't fix the warning in vmscan.c. __attribute_used__ is handled 
differently by gcc4 it seems (this is 4.1.0)
