What I'm suggesting is that rt patches shouldn't touch the existing
codebase. Instead, functionality having to do with rt should be
integrated in separate directories, and depending the way you
configure the kernel, include/linux would point to either
include/linux-srt or include/linux-hrt, much like include/asm
points to one of inclux/asm-*.

There's no trick. It's just a layout thing. Hope the above
explains what I'm trying to say.

I'm not sure that benchmarking would be relevant. This is just a
integration/layout/configuration/build suggestion. I don't think
that this organization will change anything to the benchmark
results.
