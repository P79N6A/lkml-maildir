Don't forget the embedded space, where the hardware vendor can ensure
that their hardware is well-behaved.  Even on a PC, it is possible for
someone who cares about realtime to spec a reasonable system.
On good hardware, we can easily do much better than 1ms latency with a
preemptible kernel and a spinlock cleanup.  I don't think the
limitations of some PC hardware should limit our goals for Linux.
