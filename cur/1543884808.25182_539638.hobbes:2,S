Subject: [PATCH] make cancel_rearming_delayed_work() reliable
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Thanks to Jarek Poplawski for the ideas and for spotting the bug in the
initial draft patch.
cancel_rearming_delayed_work() currently has many limitations, because it
requires that dwork always re-arms itself via queue_delayed_work(). So it
hangs forever if dwork doesn't do this, or cancel_rearming_delayed_work/
cancel_delayed_work was already called. It uses flush_workqueue() in a loop,
so it can't be used if workqueue was freezed, and it is potentially live-
lockable on busy system if delay is small.
With this patch cancel_rearming_delayed_work() doesn't make any assumptions
about dwork, it can re-arm itself via queue_delayed_work(), or queue_work(),
or do nothing.
As a "side effect", cancel_work_sync() was changed to handle re-arming works
as well.
Disadvantages:
	- this patch adds wmb() to insert_work().
	- slowdowns the fast path (when del_timer() succeeds on entry) of
	  cancel_rearming_delayed_work(), because wait_on_work() is called
	  unconditionally. In that case, compared to the old version, we are
	  doing "unneeded" lock/unlock for each online CPU.
	  On the other hand, this means we don't need to use cancel_work_sync()
	  after cancel_rearming_delayed_work().
	- complicates the code (.text grows by 130 bytes).
