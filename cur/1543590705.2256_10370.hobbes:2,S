I will test it on Sunday evening, when I get back access to my Athlon.
Again I am not sure if I had the same problem related to the
compiler-optimizations. My problems (system freeze) started with 2.4.3-ac7.
So the problem might related to the VIA-bug-workaround.
Is there a possibility to get debugging messages or register dumps without a
second PC? Or is there a possibility to an unbuffered log write? e.g. write
kernel logs to a floppy disc unbuffered. Otherwise I am not sure, if I am
able to help you finding the problem.
Unfortunately I have only a VIA-based Athlon system and not a S/390
