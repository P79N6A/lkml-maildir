Mea culpa!  I forgot to mention this other clever half.  Please excuse

Right, IPSECed packets should arguably never have DF set.  From the
RFCs, IIRC, this is configurable.
The gateways can, however, tell the hosts behind the gateways that the
tunnel is slightly smaller, to improve performance, which is what we
are trying to do.
I am still fiddling with bits and pieces to try to figure out where to
set the mss without affecting the MTU of that device or that route?
Can you be very specific about which members of which structures do
this?  I assumed that skb->dst->pmtu was one, but I am not certain.
Are they actually named 'mss'?
