So, assuming that we raise the file descriptors to an appropriate number,
we could theoretically hold 8000 sockets in 500 megs of memory? At what
point does poll() start getting dicey?

Hmmmm....we did some testing by syn-flooding my workstation with and
without syn-cookies, and while the number of incoming syn_recv was much
higher without syn_cookies enabled, we still saw (using netstat -na) a
steadily higher number of incoming syn_recvs.  Is this normal?  We assumed
that because of that, the syn_cookies were not completely working (or
aren't a panacea for syn flooding).  Based on your description, it would
seem that it would stop flooding in its tracks.  Perhaps there was a
problem in our admittedly un-scientific test.
Thanks,
