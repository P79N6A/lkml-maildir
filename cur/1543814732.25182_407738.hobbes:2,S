Yes, there will be.  If people do wrong things.

There's an implicit conversion from integer (-1, 0, 1) to boolean there. 
It _should_ require a typecast or, better,
	bool res = (strcmp(...) != 0);
But it won't require that - the compiler will just accept it..  A new `gcc
--implement-bools-properly' or perhaps sparse should warn about the above.
(Hopefully the compiler would have the brains to optimise it all away in
this specific example).
But yeah, it's always possible to deoptimise your code.
