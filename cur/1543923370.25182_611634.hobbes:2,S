I agree, that is confusing. However, you can safely add two different file 
descriptors pointing to the same file*, with different event masks, and 
that will work as expected.

OTOH you cannot list *every* possible scenario in a man page, otherwise 
you end up writing a book instead of a man page. I will try to find some 
time with Michael to refine the man page.

Does anyone that in 2007 still did not manage to find a way to avoid dups 
in hitting his mailbox, deserve any consideration at all?
OTOH many ppl, like myself, uses To and Cc header to direct email to 
proper folders, where they are treated with a different level of 
attention. And your stripp-all-headers mania screws that up badly.
