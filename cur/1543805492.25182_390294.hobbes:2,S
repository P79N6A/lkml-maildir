Subject: Dont record local apic ids when they are disabled in MADT

Hi Andrew,
We had added additional_cpus=xx for x86_64, but apparently there were some
BIOSs that had duplicate apic ids when they were reported disabled.
It seems fair not to record them, this was causing some bad behaviour due to
the duplicate apic id. More details in the bugzilla recorded in the log.
Please help with inclusion.

Some broken BIOS's had processors disabled, but 
same apic id as a valid processor. This causes
acpi_processor_start() to think this disabled 
cpu is ok, and croak. So we dont record bad
apicid's anymore.
