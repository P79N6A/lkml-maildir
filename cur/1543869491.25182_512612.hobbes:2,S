Hi,
I have just booted 2.6.20.1 on my Pentium 3 machine, which has a G400 MAX graphics card. This
machine uses the Matrox framebuffer and TV-OUT modules, and I have found these warnings in the
kernel log:
**WARNING** I2C adapter driver [DDC:fb0 #0] forgot to specify physical device; fix it!
**WARNING** I2C adapter driver [DDC:fb0 #1] forgot to specify physical device; fix it!
**WARNING** I2C adapter driver [MAVEN:fb0] forgot to specify physical device; fix it!
The relevant kernel modules seem to be:
matroxfb_maven         13228  0
i2c_matroxfb            4064  0
i2c_algo_bit            6312  1 i2c_matroxfb
Cheers,
Chris
