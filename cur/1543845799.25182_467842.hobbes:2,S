I don't see where the GPLv3 forbids such checks.  Which section are
you thinking of?  In my understanding, it says only that HP must give
users the keys to install modified software.  From section 1 (of the
July draft):
  The Corresponding Source also includes any encryption or
  authorization keys necessary to install and/or execute modified
  versions from source code in the recommended or principal context of
  use, such that they can implement all the same functionality in the
  same range of circumstances.
So the user, having the keys, can remove the cartridge check.  HP
might not like it and may choose not to distribute GPLv3 software with
the printer, but that's a separate story.
