You might want to put a few comments by spinlock functions too, since I
hit this bug in the -rt patch and it confused my for about 10 minutes. Of
course I first blamed my own work on the spinlocks before I noticed that
the caller was using "int".
But actually, I like the idea of having a irqflags_t type that must be
used.
struct irqflags_s {
	unsigned long flags;
};
typedef struct irqflags_s irqflags_t;
This would force everyone to use this structure, and it would be an easy
script to create to do a the cross the board conversion. The only problems
would be where someone didn't use "flags" as the name, but that can be
fixed as well.
