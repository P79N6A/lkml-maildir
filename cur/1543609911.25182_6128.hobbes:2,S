It's certainly doable.  I have an i386 patch against 2.4.7 which did that,
MMUPAGE_SIZE 4kB distinguished from PAGE_SIZE 4kB, 8kB, 16kB or 32kB
(but 64kB truncates to 0 in unsigned short b_size, doesn't work so well!);
while still presenting the 4kB EXEC_PAGESIZE to userspace.
It's a bit tedious working through each kernel update, to decide which
PAGEs should be MMUPAGEs etc, and I didn't see an immediate reward of
a huge leap in performance, so I haven't kept it up to date since then.
