You are the one who needs to answer this question ;-)
Most new Intel AHCI have a sane and reliable Ports-Implemented register 
value even across reset, unlike earlier ones or some clones.  For those, 
we use board_ahci_pi.
If PI is not reliable across reset or if BIOS is absent (yes we care 
about that case, when we do our own PCI resume for example), then you 
should use board_ahci.
