That would work if you don't want to use a new minor number for the
device.  But all of the current usb-serial drivers are there because
userspace tools expect the device to act just like a serial port.  Since
the userspace tools for this device is closely tied to the driver, that
restriction isn't really there.
I also agree with Johannes, this would probably be better off as a
userspace program.
