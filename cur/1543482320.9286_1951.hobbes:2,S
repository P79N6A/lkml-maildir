Me as well.  That 600MHz Alpha raises your bills a hell of a lot more; it's
dissipating in the neighbourhood of 80 watts, versus half a dozen or so for
an 'ancient' x86.
Power consumption is just not an appropriate measure for the usefulness of
a processor.  Perhaps in MIPS/watt it would be slightly less meaningless.
But then the StrongARM used in the NetWinders would win hands down.
