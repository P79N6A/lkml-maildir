I did a lspci -v and the Radeon has IRQ 5 all to itself. There is no
sharing.
I do suspect the 
agpgart: Putting AGP V2 device at 00:00.0 into 4x mode
agpgart: Putting AGP V2 device at 01:00.0 into 4x mode
might give us a clue, since lspci says
00:00.0 Host bridge: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 735 Host (rev
01)
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Radeon R200 QL
[Radeon 8500 LE]
Maybe the AGP code is trying to push some bits in the wrong
port/address?
Thanks,
florin
