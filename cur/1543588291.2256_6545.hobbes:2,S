I do not think this is a communication problem at all, but a clear lack
of understanding (perhaps willful) on the part of the "LVM maintainers"
about how to get things into the kernel.
linux/Documentation/SubmittingPatches exist to bonk people on the head
if they are screwing up, and it sounds like such is occurring now.
Quite simply,
1) Split up your patches.  How many times does it have to be said? 
Think ONE CHANGE, ONE PATCH.  Big patches full of tons of disparate
changes are impossible to review.
2) (parroting Linus)  Open source is about lack of control, not hoarding
code and lording over it.  That's why Linus will take a patch from Jens
or another knowledgeable person who says "this LVM code is broken,
-here- is a fix." -- regardless of who the "official" maintainer of the
code is listed as...
