Kernel compile on NUMA-Q looks like this:
125673 total
82183 default_idle
6134 do_anonymous_page
4431 page_remove_rmap
2345 page_add_rmap
2288 d_lookup
1921 vm_enough_memory
1883 __generic_copy_from_user
1566 file_read_actor
1381 .text.lock.file_table           <-------------
1168 find_get_page
1116 get_empty_filp
Presumably that's the same thing? Interestingly, if I look back at 
previous results, I see it's about twice the cost in -mm as it is 
in mainline, not sure why ... at least against 2.5.37 virgin it was.

Will do ... if you tell me where it is ;-)
