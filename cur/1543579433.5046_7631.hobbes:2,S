FTP is under Connection Tracking support, FTP connection tracking. Does
the same stuff as ip_masq_ftp. IRC is located in patch-o-matic -
download iptables 1.2 and do a make patch-o-matic, there is also RPC and
eggdrop support in there. I'm half in the middle of porting ip_masq_icq,
but it's one hideously ugly kludge after another. Such is life.
