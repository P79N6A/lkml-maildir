Hence the justification for a Linux logo. As I said in another thread  
"Linux Hardware Quality Labs":
"The primary motivation for this is that it leverages the individual  
power of each purchaser (of a system or individual piece of hardware)  
be they a consumer, SME, system builder, tier 1 or 2 PC manufacturer,  
government dept., or Linux distro company, into a single point of  
pressure that can be applied to OEMs to ensure that they provide open  
source drivers."
