If you're seriously interested in this then cool. Let me know how you get on.
I looked at hacking something into gtop etc. previously to use
/proc/kcore and pull out task information - I'd certainly like to see
a visual process monitor that could pull all of this stuff out and
display it for educational interest (page tables, vmas, other
resources). But then, it's probably been done - I didn't look to see
what else is out there.
