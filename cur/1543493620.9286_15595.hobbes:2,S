Hello,
	I've begun to experience a few system crashes since linux-2.2.3. I
have trouble reproducing the event, but it seems that, sometimes, when I
use more than one virtual console, and I am running xdm, the screen will
get filled with stripes and the system is crashed. Then, no alt-ctrl-del
or any key bindings do anything. I don't know if telnet works because
thins is a standalone box with no network.
	This happend 10-12 times so far, once with the dialog interface on
make menuconfig, and the rest of the time with vi. Always when I was
scrolling with the arrows, and always when I got to the bottom and the
text should have started to move up.
