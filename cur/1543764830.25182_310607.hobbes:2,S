Yes, although it is not totally trivial.

We have seen it in 9.3-beta, exact scenario was:
- root fs is XFS, ide driver is modular
  => xfs module and ide-controller module is in initramfs
  => first all modules were loaded (device driver + fs)
  => resume was triggered, resume was _really_ slow.
we worked around it in the initramfs by first loading device drivers,
triggering resume, then loading the fs modules and continuing boot.
In the resume case, we'd never reach the "load fs modules" part and
generally it seems a good idea (if the drivers are modular) to keep the
setup before resume as minimalistic as possible.
We never tried with XFS compiled in. It seems we can no longer hide from
fixing XFS ;-)
