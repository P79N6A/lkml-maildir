when you boot, your bios decides how much ram is "really" available,
usually for  good reasons.  If the bios knows that its power management
routines need a few meg off the top it'll report a few less meg to the OS
that is to be booted.  You can tell linux to ignore the bios with the kernel
parameter mem=256, but I highly recommend *against* it in this case.  Look
into it.
