Just a quick question. I'm trying to set up a Raid 0 array using solid state drives (SATA II). My thinking is that because these drives are unbuffered that a 4K chuck size would be fastest.
Am I correct?
I thought I'd ask here because people here would actually know the right answer.
Thanks in advance.
