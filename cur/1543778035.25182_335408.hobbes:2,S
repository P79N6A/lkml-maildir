I'm willing to agree to disagree.  I'm in favor of full virtualization
as well, as it is appropriate to certain styles of workloads.  I also
have enough end users who also want to share user level, share tasks,
yet also have some level of balancing between the resource consumption
of the various environments.  I don't think you are one of those end
users, though.  I don't think I'm required to make everyone happy all
the time.  ;)
BTW, does your mailer purposefully remove cc:'s?  Seems like that is
normally considered impolite.
