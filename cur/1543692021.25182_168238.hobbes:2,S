I thought it would be easier than that. However, I did write a
program that keeps the connection open forever (until the SPAM-server
hangs up). This slows down the servers. I also thought that I could
make multiple connections to the server and never hang up, depriving
the SPAM-server of resources. However, I can't make a new connection
with the same socket (don't know why), EISCONN,  without closing the
previous.
This means that I need a new socket for each connection. I run out
of sockets before the SPAM-servers do.
