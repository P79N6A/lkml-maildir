  This is a known problem. It happens because the DAC960 driver tries to use
  the block queue _before_ calling blk_init_queue(). I have informed Leonard
  about the problem, so he is aware of it and will fix it. I saw him at OLS
  today, so it probably won't get fixed within the next couple of days ;)
The DAC960 driver in 2.4.0-testN is currently out of date and I will be sending
an update as soon as I verify that the next release works.  The above problem
was actually already fixed in the 2.4.6 driver on my web page, but changes to
2.4.0-test4 broke compilation.  If you need a temporary fix for the moment,
please apply the following patch to the 2.4.6 driver from my web page.
