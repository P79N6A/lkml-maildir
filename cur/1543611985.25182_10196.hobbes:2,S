Amen!  Those are *exactly* the reasons I play with kernel upgrades.

It wont become stable if nobody can configure it because nobody will build
it or run it. Lots of people build non stable kernels because its
a) fun
b) a way to learn and play with the system
c) they might make their own small fix and mark
not all of the them are demon kernel hackers.
