It was not a problem with GPL[0-1]/BSD/MIT license, but is it still true
with GPL3? What is the difference between running application on the top
of the kernel "A" and linked with the library "B"?

... ???. I am not so sure. Kernel is really a small thing. The VMWare
proprietary hyper-visor was/is reusing Linux drivers with ease, why BSD or
Hurd can not do the same? As a former (Linux) driver writer I like to show the
following numbers to my friends:
$ du -s lib kernel  net drivers
980     lib
1728    kernel
16132   net
130872  drivers
and:
$ find ./kernel -type f -exec cat  {} + | wc -l
48312
$ find ./drivers -type f -exec cat  {} + | wc -l
3367849
================================================================
PS. Given that some of the sub-systems (e.g SCSI) in Linux still suck
badly, other OS (not as in Operating Systems but as in Open Source)
alternatives might eventually gain some ground in the enterprise
environment.
