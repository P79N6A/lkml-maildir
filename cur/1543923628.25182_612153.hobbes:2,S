Subject: [PATCH 0/4] UML - Four tidying patches for 2.6.25
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/30/302

These four patches are non-urgent and should wait for 2.6.25.  Three
of them are code cleanup and the other is an implementation of
get_wchan, which no one has been complaining about.
