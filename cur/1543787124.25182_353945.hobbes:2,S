Ok, so it seems that there's agreement that the other two inlines in
the patch makes sense, but the malloc() is not clear cut.
Since this is in initramfs after all it doesn't make that big a
difference overall, so I'll just send in a patch that inlines the
other two functions but leaves malloc() alone.
Thank you both, Nick, Con, for commenting.
