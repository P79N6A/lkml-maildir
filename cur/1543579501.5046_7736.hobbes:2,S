When playing audio CDs under kernel 2.4.0, syslog is showing the
following message repeatedly:
     sr0: CDROM (ioctl) reports ILLEGAL REQUEST.
The command line utility cdplay seems to only cause this occasionally,
when I start playing a CD or skip to a different track, while gnome's
gtcd will generate it every few seconds... presumably gtcd is regularly
querying the drive.
I'm pretty sure that this wasn't occurring under the 2.4.0-testX
kernels, but I haven't verified this as they aren't currently
installed.
The system is a dual PIII 600 (i840) with 512MB.  The CDROM is an
internal Plextor PX-20TS, connected to an Adaptec 2940UW (PCI).  SCSI
support (including the aic7xxx driver) is compiled directly into the
kernel, while CDROM support is built as a module.  The only kernel
patch applied is version 2.4.0.3 of the crypto patch from
<
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/crypto/v2.4/>.
Suggestions and/or pointers would be most appreciated.  Thanx!
