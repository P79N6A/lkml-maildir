From  Mr Isa Usman.
Auditing And Accounting Department
Bank Of Africa, Ouagadougou,  Burkina Faso.
DEAR FRIEND
I am Isa Usman., the manager in charge of auditing and accounting department 
bank of Africa ouagadougou burkina faso .With due respect and regard i have 
decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be beneficial to 
both of us at the end of the transaction .
In my department i discovered an abandoned sum of $ 10.5m ( ten million five 
hundred thousand us dollars ) in an account that belong to one of our 
foriengn  customer who died along with his family on 25th July  2000, in 
plane crash  and the fund has been dormat in his account with this bank 
without any claim of fund since we got the infomation about his death , the 
bank has been expecting his next of kin to come down and claim his money 
because the bank cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of 
kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking principles.
It is therefore upon this discovery that i have  decided to make this 
business proposal to you so that the bank will release the money to you as 
the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent 
disbursement since nobody is coming for it and i dont want this money to go 
into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill because the banking law and 
guidelines here stipulate that if such money remained unclaimed after seveen 
years the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as un claimed fund 
. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by 
the fact that the customer was a foreiner and Burkinabe cannot stand as next 
of kin to a foreiner.
In this transaction ( 30 percent ) of this money will be for you as foreign 
partner in respect  of the provision of a foreign account , (10 percent ) 
will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and   ( 60 
percent would be for me.
There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the 
percentage
indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as 
arranged , you must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of 
the deceased indicating your bank name , your account number , your 
telephone and fax number for easy efective communication and location where 
the money will be remmitted.
Upon receipt of your reply , iwill send to you by fax or mail the text of 
appliction which you shall fill and send to the bank and i will not fail to 
bring to your notice that this transaction is risk free and that you should 
not entertain any fear as all arrangements have been made for the transfer.
You should contact me immidiately as soon as you receive this message .
Thanks for your co-operation.
Isa Usman..
