That is not how things works out.
Doing trivial changes to 10+ Makefiles does not require to bother
10+ arch maintaners. Same goes for trivial fixes for any subsystem.
Linus pointed out what to do:
Keep a copy of the kernel used for last sync.
Take a copy of latest kernel.
Do a diff of all relevant files, and apply that before submitting.
When it was brought up last time, someone came with a small script to
do so.
No bk magic or other stuff needed, and I see that used by many arch
maintainers - otherwise they would loose to many trivial changes.
