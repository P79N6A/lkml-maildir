Hi,
2.4.19-pre8 adds the CONFIG_AGP_HP_ZX1 config option that should only be
available on ia64 but it was selectable on i386. The problem seems to be
that IIRC the dependency on a symbol in dep_bool doesn't work if the
symbol is neither set or unset.
The following patch should fix this (tested only on i386):
