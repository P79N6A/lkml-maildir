hi,
i have a problem with my Asus a1000 notebook.
some buttons, like video switch, mute on/off, brightness up/down
are not detected by acpi nor keyboard driver.
the strange thing is that brightness works and video switch turn on/off
my tft (can't enable other video mode, but this is not a trouble).
if it turns off tft and change brightness i guess kernel should receive
some events but
/proc/acpi/event doesn't get them.
how can i see what happens when i press those keys?
acpi4asus doesn't support my notebook.
Thanks so much.
ps. of course, as usual, i'm ready to test every suggestions/ patches
