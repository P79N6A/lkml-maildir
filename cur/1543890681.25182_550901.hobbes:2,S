But you don't need to sync *everything*. It is doable to have 1 thread
per processor, each with their own data, and sync the minimum information
(eg: statistics).

I have not said it is simple, I said that when it is justified, it is doable.

It is very often a problem because system limits have not evolved as fast
as requirements.

I agree with a small pool of workers. But they must be dedicated to CPU
only, and perform no I/O. Then you can have 1 thread/CPU.

That's clearly not my opinion, but I don't want to enter a flamewar on
the subject, it's not interesting. As long as people like us will push
the system to limits using either model, at least there will be
references for comparisons :-)
