Subject: [PATCH] small 2.4 (2.2?) change for loopback
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Alan, Linus,
please consider the following micro-patch for 2.2 and/or 2.4 loopback
devices.  It forces a re-scan of the loopback device size when BLKGETSIZE
ioctl is called, in case the underlying device/file size has changed.
This is important if, for example, an LVM device is mounted via loopback
and then resized under the loopback driver, but may also happen if a file
that is being used for a loop device is appended to.  If the loop driver
does not re-scan the size, it will continue to report the original size of
the device.
Because BLKGETSIZE is not on the path for device I/O, it should not impact
performance at all, and in normal circumstances has no impact on loop devs.
Cheers, Andreas
