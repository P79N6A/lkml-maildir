Red Hat's 2.4.20 based kernels include the rmap VM.
Due to this fixes that have gone into mainline vm may or may not
be relevant. You may notice the same bug affecting both, but they're
not necessarily fixed in the same way.

2.4.20-x.7 is a 2.4.20 kernel with additional patches.
2.4.21-4EL is a 2.4.21 kernel with additional patches.
I.e., they _are_ based off the previous kernel base.
What you've seen is that something got fixed for one product
but not for another. Hardly surprising considering the VM
for those kernels is quite different.  If the 2.4.21-4EL kernel
still suffers this bug, file it in bugzilla.

See above. The VM in Red Hat's 2.4.20 works completely differently
to mainline.
