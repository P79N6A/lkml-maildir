Which kind of proves my point about one size doesn't fit all...

Erm, how does that work? The models I've seen for threads is that all
VM is the same for all threads. Having COW pages such that one thread
ends up seeing different contents than another breaks that model.
Yeah, I know about sproc(): that's what I use for my IRIX port (had
to: IRIX didn't have POSIX threads back then). It's a pity about all
the stuffing around you have to do with arenas and usconfig(),
though.
