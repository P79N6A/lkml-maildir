That's actually not an error (sorry).  It just means that the NIC's
statistics accumulators are getting full and it's time for software to
unload them.
Probably a duplex problem.  Check your statistics counters in /proc/net/dev
for errors and take a look at the mii-diag and vortex-diag output.   There
are pointers to these in Documentation/networking/vortex.txt.
