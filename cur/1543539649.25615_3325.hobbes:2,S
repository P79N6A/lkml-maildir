That assumes an infallible root, which is a bit optimistic. What reason is
there NOT to have sanity checking, other than some people liking the
thrill of Russian roulette with their hardware?
I know enough about electricity not to prod the live wire in my mains
supply. Does this mean I should leave the cover off my fusebox? After all,
my house is secure, so nobody gets to do anything improper there...

The "security" aspect of this is largely a red herring, I suspect; at
best, fixing this will make a malicious root marginally less damaging. The
real issue is just that the kernel is accepting unvalidated parameters
from userspace, and shooting itself in the foot with them. MS took a fair
bit of flak, IIRC, for doing this with WIN32K.SYS in NT4. Do we now expect
higher standards of design from NT than Linux? :-)

No thanks - I've just eaten :-)
Seriously, in the NT case at least, the kernel is expected to validate the
parameters it is passed from userland. It doesn't matter what user or
capability set the process has - it can still only pass valid parameters.
Where a parameter is being accepted unchecked, the code in question is
regarded as a bug, and fixed as such.

This isn't a security issue, really, just a "this is a dangerous
implementation" issue. As a longer term aim, I'd like to see this sort of
loophole for hardware manufacturers to bypass the kernel closed off, too -
I don't want to see a load of vendor-specific binaries screwing with the
hardware completely outside the kernel's control.
Other things like CPU microcode updates have sanity checking - why not do
the same here? HDD firmware upgrades can hardly be performance critical,
after all!
James.
