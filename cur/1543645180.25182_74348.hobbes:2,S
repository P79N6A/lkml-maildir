Hmm, I tried to explain this in comments in the patch ...

We need a context to look up the EIP against when we process each sample
in buffer_sync.c. We could just log current at sample time along with
EIP/event, but why would it be preferrable to just logging the same
information once when it's needed ?
Basically it's a matter of :
	task_struct *
	EIP/Event
	EIP/Event
	EIP/Event
	EIP/Event
	....
versus
	task_struct */EIP/Event
	task_struct */EIP/Event
	task_struct */EIP/Event
	task_struct */EIP/Event
	task_struct */EIP/Event
	....
Where task_struct is the same as the previous entry for the vast
majority of entries.

Sure, but it was ugly as hell (and worked completely differently)
