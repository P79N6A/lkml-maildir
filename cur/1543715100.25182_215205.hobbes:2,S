Paul, the patch you show reflects how ptep_get_and_clear looked in
2.6.5, but not how it now looks in 2.6.6-rc1-bk - should be using
page_mapping(page) and mapping_writably_mapped(mapping).
I dare say you're referring to a master tree into which the recent
mainline changes need to be ported (I CC'ed gniibe@m17n.org when
sending those changes to akpm): I'm not saying your version is
wrong, just trying to make sure that two sets of changes in the
same area don't end up with one set getting lost.
