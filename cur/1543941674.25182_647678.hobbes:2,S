Does the mm tree also have a calm down period during release candidates ?
I have modified the patchset so now if rcu helpers are used from
rculist.h then fine otherwise gcc warns you that you're using the
helpers from list.h like this:
init/foo.c:13: warning: ‘__deprecated_list_add_rcu’ is deprecated (declared at include/linux/rculist.h:76)
But the build process doesn't fail anymore.
For that I added some ugly hacks in list.h and rculist.h but they
definitively should be removed for mainline inclusion. I'm sending them
in response to this email.
If we include this now, then people can have a chance to notice that
rculist.h exists and fix their stuffs until 2.6.25 release
candidates but I'll redo the patchset and give it some test around the
2.6.25-rc1 timeframe anyway.
