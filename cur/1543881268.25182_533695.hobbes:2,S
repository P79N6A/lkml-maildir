On the SCx200, the scx200_acb driver doesn't actually detect the
device. It uses arbitrary I/O addresses and hopes for the best. By
default, two buses are created, at 0x820 and 0x840. This might simply
not be the right addresses for your board. See
Documentation/i2c/busses/scx200_acb.
You should enable CONFIG_I2C_DEBUG_BUS and see what the driver says
when being loaded.
I seem to remember there has been a patch floating around to
auto-detect the right ports back in June 2006, but it seems to have
been lost somehow. Jordan, do you remember?

Not only. There was also a log of bug fixing.
