No.  That's right.  The increment doesn't happen until the leap second
has happened.  The TIME_OOP exists to increment the TAI offset at the
right time.  The decrement would happen right away, since the second
is deleted at the end of :58.
I had to draw lots of pictures when I was working this code out in
FreeBSD.
