Subject: Can a non-sg scsi write command be more than PAGE_SIZE length?

...or more importantly, is it allowed.  Kernel is FC3 2.6.10-1.766.
The latest iscsi driver[1] blows on a 32K-long request for a tape write
which followed this path:
 [<f8cef985>] iscsi_queuecommand+0x161/0x2f1 [iscsi_tcp]
 [<f883f724>] scsi_dispatch_cmd+0x1e9/0x24f [scsi_mod]
 [<f88440ff>] scsi_request_fn+0x29a/0x310 [scsi_mod]
 [<c0217487>] blk_insert_request+0x8b/0x9e
 [<f88430b8>] scsi_insert_special_req+0x20/0x26 [scsi_mod]
 [<f8cc043e>] st_do_scsi+0x111/0x147 [st]
 [<f8cc026c>] st_sleep_done+0x0/0xc1 [st]
 [<f8cc189b>] st_write+0x3eb/0x671 [st]
 [<c0152484>] vfs_write+0xb6/0xe2
 [<c015254e>] sys_write+0x3c/0x62
 [<c0103c97>] syscall_call+0x7/0xb
The command is not using scatter-gather (sc->use_sg is 0) but is more
than PAGE_SIZE, and the driver hates that.  So my question is whether
it's allowed (then I'll have to fix the driver, not sure many people
have virtual tapes over iscsi) or whether st_write has to be fixed.
  OG.
