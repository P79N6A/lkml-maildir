Right. But, with the token bouncing around, effectively the RSS of the
processes at that time will keep increasing, and they should be able to
spend more time on execution than i/o. And meanwhile the priorities of
the tasks that were contending for the token, but didnt get it, will
increment. So since the fairness is preserved, all the tasks should get
their fair share for execution and it should result in a speedup as
compared to the current upstream implementation. I took a time
instrumentation of the vanilla 2.6.18 kernel build with -j 4 and I've
posted up the results in the previous mail. I'm testing on an ibm t42
1.69Ghz 64M system.

Cool!
Had you applied these patches when you posted your test results ?
Thanks
