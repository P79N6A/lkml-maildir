Hi folks outside,
because I am completely new to this mailing list I just want to 
characterize myself shortly.
I am Nico Schmoigl, living in Germany. As a young child I had my 
first contact with the computers. Soon I got familar with them and 
since 1997 I'm using Linux and I'm pleased about it. I do not think 
that I have to sum up those advantiges of this OS here :)
As a student I am writing my Abitur (the final exam in Germany) 
this year. At our school we use Linux on two servers and since we 
installed it, our system got very reliable.
But there is one bug which I cannot locate at all. I think it must be 
somewhere in the PCI-system of the kernel. I want to discribe this 
problem:
Starting the kernel, everything seems to be very good. Sometimes 
(it can often be seen if you compile a new kernel and booting it the 
first time) the system hangs up at the point where it has written 
"Probing PCI devices". Nothing seems to go back or forth. Now if 
you reset the system and restarting the kernel, you fall into the 
same problem. But if you reset the system several times, 
suddently I goes beyond that message and everything works 
good.But the surprise comes now: After you got those this trouble 
you will not experience this again! Any time you reboot it does not 
hang up. Only if you recompile and install a new kernel version you 
might reproduce it. 
I am currently using 2.2.0-pre6. From version 2.1.120-2.1.135 the 
bug appeared very seldom. In the version around 2.1.110 it was 
very common. Although not having experienced it in the 2.0.20s, I 
thing it has the same problem because I had it in the 2.0.30s. 
To this mail I am attaching some information to show how my 
system is assembled.
If anyone needs some more information please let me know - I'll try 
my best to get it.
Besides this problem, I just read through 
Documentation/fb/vesafb.txt and some other documents. I found 
some minor spelling mistakes - nothing important. But I want to 
submit it, so that this simple things are out of this kernel. I can put 
them into this mailinglist, but I do not think that we need to discuss 
those changes. Now my question: To whom I have to send this 
diff -u, so that it can be included sometime in the new kernel? To 
you, Linus?
Thanks for your help and your answers...
