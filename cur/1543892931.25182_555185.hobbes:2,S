Ok, so after I figured out again how to enable the nmi watchdog, I found
a few more bugs. One is pretty clear, calling a function directly while
the wrapper should be used, causing a(nother) BUG() when the watchdog is
disabled using /proc/sys/...
The other is less clear (to me). It seems like the perfect candidate to
muck up the watchdog, but I can't get it to do that. On system boot up,
the MSRs are no longer reserved, so some other subsystem might mess with
them. The only suitable subsystem I found was oprofile though, and I
could neither get that to reproduce the hang here nor does oprofile show
up in your logs.
Anyway, both are bugs and should be fixed. Maybe we're even lucky and it
fixes your hang. *fingers crossed*
