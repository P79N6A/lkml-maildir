gstreamer might work for your average desktop application, and a
gstreamer plugin for this might be very handy indeed. However, there are
setups where gstreamer is just too bloated, and there's no way I could
squeeze it on the box's filesystem (think in the 8-16Mb range for
available space).
A small decoding library and a gstreamer plugin on top of that would be
the best solution, I think.
However, until there's such a thing, Luc's driver works fine for me and
my employer.
(Also, keep in mind that PWC thingies are pretty common in some circles,
and owners of these devices would like to see a working driver now.
Instead of a perfect one a year from now. Therefore, the driver staging
in the -ac tree is a very good thing, imho.)
