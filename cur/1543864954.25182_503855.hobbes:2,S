... and *growing*, which is the real issue I think.
Something that might make sense for KS is to have multiple sessions 
(perhaps replacing some or all of the "mini-summits" that have cropped 
up) combined with some bigger, overall sessions.  At least that way 
there would be more cross-pollination between the various groups than if 
we eventually end up meeting everywhere.
That's of course only practical if KS is separated from any other 
conference (like OLS.)
