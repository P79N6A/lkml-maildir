I can see another extension to this functionality.  With appropriate  
changes it might also be possible to have a container exist across  
multiple computers using some cluster code for synchronization and  
fencing.  The outermost container would be the system boot container,  
and multiple inner containers would use some sort of network- 
container-aware cluster filesystem to spread multiple vservers across  
multiple servers, distributing CPU and network load appropriately.

I have yet to see any problem, however complicated, which, when you  
looked at it in the right way, did not become still more complicated.
