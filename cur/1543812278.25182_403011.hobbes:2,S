I think most important part is update_times() cleanup (to avoid
jiffies/wall_jiffies mismatch) and it (and x86_64 part) seems not
conflict with john's work for now.

I and Ralf talked a bit about the jiffies issue.  Making an union
containing jiffies and jiffies_64 looks good to avoid such an
optimization problem, but it would affect so many existing codes.
