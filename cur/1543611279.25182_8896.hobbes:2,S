Err,
	close(-ENOMEM);
What's that going to close?  Hint: you _can't_ close a descriptor that
failed to open, since you don't have a descriptor to close.  You can
only try to close an error code, but that's not going to make it anywhere
near the kernel driver level.

Correct.

Here's an example why that'd be real bad:
1. process A opens /dev/ttyS0 as a normal device.  This initialises
   tty->driver_data.
2. process B tries to open /dev/cua0
3. process B fails with -EBUSY since the normal device is open and active
   (see block_til_ready)
4. since rs_open failed, we set tty->driver_data to be NULL (note that this
   is the same tty device pointer as (1) above.
5. process A writes to /dev/ttyS0
6. rs_write does the following:
        struct async_struct *info = (struct async_struct *)tty->driver_data;
7. Oops.
