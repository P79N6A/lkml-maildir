Yeah, I was thinking about something like that.  It's unclear how it should
figure out how much memory to grab, though.  You'd have to get some idea
how desperate the host is for memory and balance that off against how 
desperate the VM is.
And you want to avoid doing things that just aggravate the host's situation,
i.e. if it is swapping its brains out, you want the VM to just drop some
clean pages and you definitely don't want it swapping dirty ones and add
to the host's IO load.

Yup.
Is any of your (you or IBM in general) thinking on this written down publically
anywhere?
