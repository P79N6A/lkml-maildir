Because ext4 is impending, you want to push a bunch of cleanups into 
ext3 over a short span of time.  That's not routine maintenance at all. 
  We're not talking about routine maintenance.  In your words, we are 
talking about spring cleaning.
Why not let the devel/stable system work its magic?  If the cleanups are 
viable, proving that first in ext4 should give us more confidence to put 
them into ext3.
Cross-porting bugfixes and cleanups will _obviously_ be quite easy, 
during the first few months of ext4's life.
Just look at ext2->ext3 history.  Regardless of when you make the split, 
there will be a bunch of stuff people wish to backport after the split 
occurs.  Given that, it makes more sense to testbed the changes in ext4 
first.
