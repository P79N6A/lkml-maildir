Putting on a different hat, that of forensics and auditing, I would
claim that such functionality is useful for every API. If something
can be set, then there must be a corresponding way to find out.
For settings created with *netlink, it is entirely reasonable to
use the *netlink API to query its state. It's just a pain in the
butt for people like me to find out and advise users.
