It depends on the hardware. In principle, with this patch _if_ your system 
can suspend while keeping the UART powered on and the interrupt from this 
UART can wake up your system, then using this patch and the command above 
you'll be able to also keep the UART configured, i.e., prevent the driver 
from suspending it during suspend and then an interrupt from this UART 
will wake up the system. How you generate this interrupt - doesn't matter. 
Whether it is a received byte, or a modem line toggle, as long as it 
produces an interrupt, the system will wake up.
Don't know whether "normal" PCs can do that and if yes - how.
Thanks
