Duh!  (what a maroon)  I booted the wrong kernel due to a typo.
I enabled some other debug options (poke/hope), and it now boots past
the BUG at arch/i386/mm/pageattr.c:165 point, through the sound NULL
pointer dereference, and on to the eventual complete hang as NFS is
being initialized.  The log shows 326 failures at lines 385 and 589.
