Compilation is easily fixed, a patch is below.
BTW, this will still leave the macsonic driver in a non-working state. I 
have a patch to make it work again, which also re-introduces the support 
for 16-bit cards that went missing way back in 2.4.something (jazzsonic 
cards are all 32-bit, as are some mac cards). My patch basically ports the 
current macsonic driver from mac68k 2.2 branch, and has been widely tested 
on macs. Problem is, it hasn't yet been tested on MIPS, and it makes a lot 
of changes to sonic.c, which is shared by jazzsonic and macsonic.
Can anyone with a Jazz machine help out with this?
One of the difficulties is that MIPS and m68k architectures each have 
their own repo, and last time I looked, the SONIC code in the MIPS repo 
didn't agree with the SONIC code in the m68k repo. But, it shouldn't be 
difficult to make macsonic and jazzsonic work with the same core driver 
code again. Besides, we already have two SONIC drivers in the tree, 
seperating jazzsonic and macsonic would add a third.
