Subject: [PATCH 110/114] x86: move non-standard 32-bit platform Kconfig entries
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/28/594

- make X86_GENERICARCH depend X86_NON_STANDARD
- move X86_SUMMIT, X86_ES7000 and X86_BIGSMP out of the subarchitecture
  menu and under this option
