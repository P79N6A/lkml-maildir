It would seem that what concerns all of these levels is the process
migration cost, so perhaps it will be possible in 2.6 after all. Right
now a lot of clever people are actively working on scheduling, so now
is the time for a breakthrough which gives a big boost. Absent that I
predict all of the clever folks and most of us "build a bunch of
kernels and play" types will conclude the low hanging fruit have all
been picked and move on. Scheduling will be stable again.
Before that perhaps one of you will suddenly see some way to make this
all very simple and elegant, so everyone can look and say "of course"
and everything will work optimally.
What we have in all of these patches is a big gain over base, so the
efforts have produced visable gains.
