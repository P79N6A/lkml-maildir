This reminds me of a known UltraSPARC chip bug.  There is a bug
wherein if you do a 64-bit endianness swapped load instruction, it
only endian swaps within each 32-bit word, not throughout the entire
64-bit word as it should.
But this is weird, because the errata description for this chip bug
says that it only applies to the deprecated 32-bit mode "ldd/std"
instructions, whereas the compiler emits the 64-bit "ldx/stx"
instructions for sparc64 kernel builds.
So, first, let's sanity check the ___arch__swab64p() implementation:
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#define ASI_PL			0x88 /* Primary, implicit, l-endian	*/
typedef unsigned long __u64;
static __inline__ __u64 ___arch__swab64p(const __u64 *addr)
{
	__u64 ret;
	__asm__ __volatile__ ("ldxa [%1] %2, %0"
			      : "=r" (ret)
			      : "r" (addr), "i" (ASI_PL));
	return ret;
}
int main(void)
{
	unsigned long tval = 0x123456789abcdef0;
	unsigned long *p, v;
	p = &tval;
	v = ___arch__swab64p(p);
	printf("%016lx --> %016lx\n",
	       tval, v);
	exit(0);
}
Running this on my Ultra-IIIi workstation (this chip doesn't have
said errata) gives the desired result:
davem@sunset:~/src/GIT/sparc-2.6$ gcc -m64 -O2 -o x x.c
davem@sunset:~/src/GIT/sparc-2.6$ ./x
123456789abcdef0 --> f0debc9a78563412
davem@sunset:~/src/GIT/sparc-2.6$
So it looks sane.  Let's try this on a chip that has the errata:
? ./x
123456789abcdef0 --> f0debc9a78563412
? 
That's fine too, so this isn't what is causing the problems.
Wait, I think I see the problem.  Is that "&id[100<<1]" pointer
aligned properly on a 64-bit boundary?  I bet it isn't, and the
sparc64 unaligned load/store trap handler doesn't check whether one of
the endian swapping load/store attributes are being used.
Looking at the assembler generated for aoecmd.s, it isn't aligned:
	add	%l1, 236, %g2
 ...
	ldxa [%g2] 136, %g7
That's aligned on a 4-byte boundary, but not an 8-byte one.
So this is what the bug is.
