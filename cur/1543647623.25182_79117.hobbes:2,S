Attached is a patch (1.749 at bk://cifs.bkbits.net/linux-2.5-with-cifs) for
renaming the cifs vfs debug function that you noted can conflict in some
cases with a jfs debug function of the same name if jfs debugging is
enabled
(See attached file: cifs-rename-internal-debug-function.patch)

Also patch 1.748 which fixes 64 compiler warnings in the cifs vfs and
removes an optional debug function whose name conflicted (print_status) was
also posted to bk://cifs.bkbits.net/linux-2.5-with-cifs earlier today.

Both jfs and cifs ship a function called `dump_mem' causing the following
compile error when both are included:
<--  snip  -->
   ld -m elf_i386  -r -o fs/built-in.o ...
fs/jfs/built-in.o: In function `dump_mem':
fs/jfs/built-in.o(.text+0xe420): multiple definition of `dump_mem'
fs/cifs/built-in.o(.text+0x3af0): first defined here
make[1]: *** [fs/built-in.o] Error 1
make: *** [fs] Error 2
<--  snip  -->
