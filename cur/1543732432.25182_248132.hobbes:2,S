Why is the kset needed?  We can determine that from the kobject.
How about changing this to:
	int send_kevent(struct kobject *kobj, struct attribute *attr);
which just tells userspace that a specific attribute needs to be read,
as something "important" has changed.
Will passing the attribute name be able to successfully handle the 
"enum kevent" and "signal" combinations?
thanks,
