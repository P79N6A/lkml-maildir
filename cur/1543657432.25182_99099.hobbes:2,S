clone() and vfork() both use int $0x80.  The vfork() problem is obvious.
And the way we use clone() with a separate stack for the child it is
easy to see that we cannot prepare the stack appropriately for both
situations.  When the child is started it returns with a carefully
crafted stack which among other values find the start functions address
on the stack.
There might be a way to make this use int and vsyscall at the same time
but I don't think it is worth it.
