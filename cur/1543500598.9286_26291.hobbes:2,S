From the man page:
       flags is one of O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY or O_RDWR which request
       opening the  file  read-only,  write-only  or  read/write,
       respectively.
What about an open() that is only used to grab a file handle?
One might not have read access on the file, but there are plenty
of functions that take a file descriptor.
