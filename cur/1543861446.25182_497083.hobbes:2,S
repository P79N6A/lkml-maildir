I guess you could have cwq->thread flush only it's cpu's workqueue by
running on another cpu, which will avoid the need to synchronize
between worker threads. I am not 100% sure if that breaks workqueue
model in any way (since we could have two worker threads running on the
same CPU, but servicing different queues). Hopefully it doesnt.
However the concern expressed below remains ..
