Ah well acrobat reader does some very strange things, even stranger when it's 
a plugin in mozilla. A kernel profile while running it (like yours) shows mad 
virtual memory activity, not just rescheduling so apart from starving acrobat 
reader forcibly (or mozilla when acroread is the plugin) the scheduler can't 
help it an awful lot. Try opening pdfs in another pdf viewer and you'll see 
what I mean.

The (priority inversion) starvation issue is being actively attended to in a 
different way at the moment but acroread is a different beast again, and we 
shall see.

Of course; any report contributes to the pool of information; thank you.
