Do you have a link to the standard?  Iirc, it is explicitly
unspecified whether files created/deleted after opendir/rewinddir are
returned.  Why do you want to return one such unspecified file now?
Especially when the implementation is ugly and the whole concept
appears to be plain stupid.

Does the above really happen, or is this just a theoretical case?  At
least it looks as if ext3 with dir_index will simply barf on it:
	/* Some one has messed with f_pos; reset the world */
	if (info->last_pos != filp->f_pos) {
		...
And imo, that is the correct behaviour.  Anything else would leave the
door wide open for trivial DOS attacks on kernel memory.
