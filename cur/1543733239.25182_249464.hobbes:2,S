Is the code in question attributed to a single developer or to a horde?
I only have a 2.4 kernel handy, so I can't check.
If it's a single developer or just a few, you could ask them for
permission to put it under a less restrictive license.  Petr Vandrovec
gave that permission for his components of the matroxfb code.
A lot of times the FB people don't really care about the license and
slap GPL on it just because that's the default thing to do for code
going into the Linux kernel.  It doesn't necessarily mean that they
would only grant permission for the code to be used in GPL scenarios.
