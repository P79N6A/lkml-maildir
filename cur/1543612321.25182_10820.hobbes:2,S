Hmm.  Actually most flash chips I have seen for roms have a couple of nice
properties.  1 Voltage so you don't need to play with Vpp.  Either socketed or
their is a jumper that inverts an address line to allow easy switching to a
fallback image.  Of course not all motherboard makers have a clue, but
most do.
It may be worth asking but at this point I don't think anyone has actually
written a driver for the A7V266.  Via hasn't been the most supportive of
companies with the chipset documentation.
