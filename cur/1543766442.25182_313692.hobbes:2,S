 Hello to All,
     I am facing problems like various warnings after giving mount point
for  jffs2 File System as  /tmp dir .
     I have Root file system as ext2 . Please can I be guided on foll :
      1.) Is it that Mount point for filesystem should not be /tmp .
      2.) Are there any other dir which should not be given as a mount
point for File system.
 BR,
 Mansi
