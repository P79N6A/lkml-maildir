I totally agree.  On the other hand, you need REDIRECT for things  
like transparent proxies which by definition aren't visible as  
anything other than a router or bridge.

The problem is this:
I want to be able to filter bridged network traffic *both* based on  
the IP layer *and* the physical device it's going to be routed out.   
Due to fundamental problems with a statically-ordered architecture,  
it's impossible to get both, see commit  
68df071a201f06b08cdc07111c6d4af918e64edd (found here: http:// 
lists.netfilter.org/pipermail/netfilter-devel/2006-December/ 
026388.html).  Basically if you want such cross-layer hooks, right  
now your *ONLY* choice is to use marks with 2 drawbacks:  (1)  There  
are a very small number of marks which must be carefully allocated by  
your firewall-setup script  (2)  Marks are inherently extremely  
fragile for passing data between layers.

No, the intent of "-j BRIDGE" would be _after_ "-j ROUTE" and some  
kind of "-j ARP", to actually compute which physical port a given  
packet should go.

Well the problem is this:  Do you want the packet accepted locally or  
forwarded.  If forwarded, how do you want it routed, and which  
physical port do you want it to go out?  Without a statically-coded  
ordering for all those things there is no way to say what the  
"default" is.  You would need some way to switch between iptables/ 
ip6tables (for compatibility) and pkttables/nettables (for advanced  
functionality).

It does give you a million more ways to shoot yourself in the foot.   
Some things would have constraints like "output device must be  
set" (BRIDGE/ARP, for example).  If you accidentally stuck non- 
constrained things in the wrong order you could get totally-non-IP- 
compliant behavior.  On the other hand, it does give you many choices  
about IPsec before or after ROUTING (or after one routing step and  
before another), etc.
