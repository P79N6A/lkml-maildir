Right.  DEBUG_SLAB and DEBUG_PAGEALLOC will change where things end up in
memory.  The part that *I* was surprised at was that turning them on did *NOT*
make the code quickly die as expected - but it *did* corrupt the on-screen
image.  That's telling me that the DEBUG stuff is setting canaries that end up
in memory locations that the fbdev code thinks are destined for the display
pixels.  (And conversely, that when you build without those two debug options,
that the fbdev code is parking those now not visibly corrupted pixels on top of
somebody's pointer chains and that's where the memory corruption is coming
from.
Or I could just be full of it as usual.. :)
