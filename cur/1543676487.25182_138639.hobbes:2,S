I believe that we would need callbacks for DFSes because many of them
have different locking granularities.  For example, a number of them allow
writes from different clients to different pages of the same file
fully in parallel, with no communication between the clients required.
Communication is required only when one client attempts to write to
a page most recently written to by another client.
The locking required to support this is more complex than would
be justified in most local-filesystem cases, I suspect.  ;-)

Good news, they are OK with your approach for handling the truncation
race!  They still believe they need the callback for handling fine-grained
locking required for invalidations.

Sounds great!!!  Of course, if we get it all agreed to before then,
we will just have to find other things to talk about at OLS.  ;-)
Hopefully by that time, one of the DFSes will be released under GPL.
Don't ask.  :-/

Cool!  Then there is no need to worry about fr_lock getting accepted
into 2.5.  ;-)

Unless you have other thoughts, I will take a stab at making
the patches safe for each other.
