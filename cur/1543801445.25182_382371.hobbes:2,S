Hmm, it would be nice if that comment was in reply to the email in which

device that actually woke the system up, which is in direct conflict with
what I've always assumed - that when a system wakes up, it is caused by a
single device (and if there were multiple events, like a key press *and* a
mouse movement, it's doesn't really matter)..
