Hi Tomas,
the reason for hid-input not claiming the device is very probably that the 
report descriptor of the device doesn't comply with what the in-kernel 
HID-input driver is accepting.
Could you please 
- compile the kernel with CONFIG_HID_DEBUG and send me the output you 
  receive when you connect the device
- if you'd like to work on it yourself, try to analyze the hid report 
  descriptor (it will be in the kernel log after you plug the device into 
  CONFIG_HID_DEBUG compiled kernel) and see what types of collection types 
  and usages does it contain. Please look at the code in 
  drivers/hid/hid-input.c:hidinput_connect() to understand which HID 
  devices are being claimed by the hid-input subsystem (the very first 
  loop over all the collections is the most important one)
