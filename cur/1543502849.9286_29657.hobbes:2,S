My apologies, I may have been unclear.  I've been trying to clear all
the cache data and have been calling the following: to reduce the
dcache     -- prune_dcache(0);
page cache --   empty_dcache(); -- a clone of prune dcache that calls 
                       clear_inode_pages() for each dcache entry
           --   and/or a modified shrink_mmap() that 
                    if (xxxx_under_min())  removed and (below)
inode cache --  free_inode_memory(20);
buffer cache --		sys_sync(); & invalidate_all_buffers();  
 
all in an order something like this.  
Is there a better way you'd recommend for clearing the cached I/O
data?  I suspect the best things seems to be a reboot, and then memory
exhaust will suffice as an approximation despite its side effects.
In any case, sincerely thanks for your patience and help,
