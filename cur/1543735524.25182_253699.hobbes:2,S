Just use /etc/dev.d. No delays, no polling. Everything is event based.

It  would not be necessary if the module provides some pseudo-device
without device nodes and loading will *always* succeed.
If this is not the case (ie. always), your script is even unsuitable for a
static /dev.
(I know that many scripts make that assumption, including my own.
Nevertheless it is wrong, and has always been wrong.)

How do you want to solve it? We cannot look into the future, so how should
we know which device nodes "modprobe xyz" will or should create?
dev.d is a nice solution. If any device node is created, your script is
called. If it is the node you want, you perform your actions.
