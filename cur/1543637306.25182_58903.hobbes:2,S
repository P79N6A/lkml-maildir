Well did you look at the code? It's the infamous Broadcom bcm5700
driver which is probably the worst driver code we have seen in the
Linux community for the last 5 years. Sure you can run it, but don't
come back and complain when you run into trouble. You will be a lot
better off using the tg3 driver, or better yet, getting a NIC thats
less buggy.
Cheers,
Jes
