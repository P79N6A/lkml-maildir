Subject: nfsv2 ref leak in 2.6.24?

I'm testing unionfs on top of nfsv2/3/4, using 2.6.24 as of linus's commit
4fa4d23fa20de67df919030c1216295664866ad7.  A lot of my unionfs regression
tests are failing on nfs2, b/c files that should be deleted, aren't.  It
feels like there may be a ref leak that prevents the files from being
deleted, or maybe an unlink issue.  It doesn't happen in all of my previous
kernels w/ identical unionfs (code 2.6.9--2.6.23).  And in 2.6.24 it happens
only w/ nfs2 -- nfs3/4 are fine.
I'm not sure if this is a client or server issue, and I'm only starting to
dig deeper.  But I thought I'd ask you in case this is a known problem and
you have a fix.  If this is the first you hear of this problem, let me know
and I'll try to narrow it down further.
Thanks,
Erez.
