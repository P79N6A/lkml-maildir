Subject: 'vintage' via dma bug

I have the misfortune to run a rather old PIII machine with a VIA chipset, 
a Fedora Core 1 distro with 2.4.22 kernel and two PATA hard mirrored hard 
disk, on two separate channels, both set to primary. I've experienced some 
data corruption lately and after much googling I've found that 4-5 years 
ago some via chipset experienced a similar problem with dma transfers, 
especially with hard disk configured the very same way as my setup. The bug 
was fixed, I gather, in 2.4.4. I've upgrade the kernel to 2.6.10 (the 
latest Fedora legacy core *TWO* kernel, with fingers crossed) but the 
corruption problems usually start to pop up only after a few weeks of 
uptime, especially under relatively heavy load.
I couldn't find more precise pointers after all these years so I'd like to 
know if that bug really affected my chipset, and if 2.6.10 is a valid 
solution.. 
the kernel identifies the chipset at boot:
