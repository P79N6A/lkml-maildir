Hi,
I make the tests of fsck with raid-soft 2x18Go raid-1.
We crash the server to see how much time does fsck take
(power down) :)
- with standard /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit of redhat 6.2
it takes 1h30 (with lot of inodes)
- i modified the options of fsck and erased -a.
In place I put -y
The fsck takes 8 minutes with log of inodes (more inodes ;) ).
3 questions:
- what is the difference between -a et -y ?
man gives:
       -a     Automatically  repair  the  file system without any questions (use this option with caution).  Note that
              e2fsck(8) supports -a for backwards compatibility only.  This option is mapped  to  e2fsck's  -p  option
              which is safe to use, unlike the -a option that most file system checkers support.
and -y does not repair automatically ?
- what is it so long with -a ?
- is it safe solution ?
Thanks for help
Octave
