I've had this board for a couple of months now. The only problem I have
is that the onboard NIC doesn't work with the sis900 module. And then
there's some messages in dmesg that have so far not caused me any problems:
SIS_IDE: probe of 0000:00:02.5 failed with error -1
Losing some ticks... checking if CPU frequency changed.
With some kernels (I'm sure about the one that came with ubuntu, but
also with at least one other x86_64 distribution) dhcpcd didn't work
with the tulip card that's in there now.
I've never had panics though. I'm running vanilla and gentoo 2.6.11 and
12-rc3 sources on this board.
