i have a quantum fireballst udma 33 drive. Its not that fast but anyways.
i cant run udma33 either i get the exact same thing if i switch to udma 33 ,
i did turn dma on , and i did turn 32bit transfers on ... 
but thats it. 
that made me go up to 7.5 from 4-5 mb/sec ... since this is my boot dirve 
i had to reboot about 7 times (every time i turned udma on ) 
and i finally gave up... 
here is a listing from my hdparm : 
[root@beast widow]# hdparm /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
 multcount    =  0 (off)
 I/O support  =  1 (32-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 nowerr       =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 782/128/63, sectors = 6306048, start = 0
here are the settings i use : 
grep hdparm *
grep: init.d: Is a directory
rc.local:hdparm -X12 /dev/hda
rc.local:hdparm -c1 /dev/hda
rc.local:hdparm -d1 /dev/hda
rc.local:hdparm -u1 /dev/hda
  -X     Set the IDE transfer mode for newer (E)IDE/ATA2 drives.  This  is
              typically  used in combination with -d1 when enabling DMA
to/from
              a drive on a supported interface chipset (such as the Intel
430FX
              Triton),  where -X34 is used to select multiword DMA mode2
trans-
              fers.  Apart from that, use of  this  flag  is  seldom
necessary
              since  most/all  modern  IDE  drives default to their fastest
PIO
              transfer mode at power-on.  Fiddling with this can be both
need-
              less  and  risky.   On  drives  which  support alternate
transfer
              modes, -X can be used to switch  the  mode  of  the  drive
only.
              Prior  to changing the transfer mode, the IDE interface should
be
              jumpered or programmed (see -p flag) for the new mode setting
to
              prevent  loss  and/or  corruption of data.  Use this with
extreme
              caution!  For the PIO (Programmed  Input/Output)  transfer
modes
              used  by  Linux, this value is simply the desired PIO mode
number
              plus 8.  Thus, a value of 09  sets  PIO  mode1,  10  enables
PIO
              mode2, and 11 selects PIO mode3.  Setting 00 restores the
drive's
              "default" PIO mode, and 01 disables IORDY.
