There is a quite large variety of keyboards these days; putting stuff
in the kernel is meaningless. You'll have to use the setkeycodes
utility to assign keycodes to these 14 keys. See also

Usually keycodes 89-95 and 112-118 and 120-127 are free to be assigned.
Concerning these LEDs, you can patch the kernel to automatically
set/clear them when appropriate, or you can send the required
codes from userspace. For example, if you use these keys to control
a CD player, like the labels suggest, then this cdplay program
should listen to these keys, and set LEDs when desired.
Probably the program does not exist yet. People do not usually write
programs that require one particular keyboard.
At present there is no good interface that would allow a user space
utility to request part of the keyboard. And I do not know any userspace
utilities today that would profit from the possibility.
