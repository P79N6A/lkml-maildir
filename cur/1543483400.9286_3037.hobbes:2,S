Ran across a hangup in 2.2.1 -
What happened was that, after having my system up for
16 hours, I found I suddenly couldn't run an `expect' 
script in a particular xterm window. The script worked just 
fine in other xterms.
The WCHAN seems to point to it getting hung up in 
tty_wait_until_sent(). Here are the relevant processes:
 PID  WCHAN       STA TTY TIME COMMAND
2255  pipe_read   S   p2  0:00 expect -f /home/frankm/bin/fly 
2256  wait4       S   p4  0:00 expect -f /home/frankm/bin/fly
2257  wait4       S   p4  0:00 sh -c /bin/stty sane < /dev/ttyp4 
2258  tty_wait_un S   p4  0:00 /bin/stty sane 
The script is running an automated telnet login (to a machine
I'm connected to over a PPP modem link). 
System info:

For the record, in other xterms I see:
WCHAN       STA TTY TIME COMMAND
do_select   S   p3  0:00 expect -f /home/frankm/bin/fly
... when it works correctly.
Is there any other information I could give that would help?
