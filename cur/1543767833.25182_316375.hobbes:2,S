Andrew,
You can pull:
rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/shaggy/jfs-2.6.git/HEAD-for-mm
whenever you do an -mm build.  If your scripts have a problem with that,
you might try
rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/shaggy/jfs-2.6.git#for-mm
Let me know which you prefer.
Thanks,
Shaggy
