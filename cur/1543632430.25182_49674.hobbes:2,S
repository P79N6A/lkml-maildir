Subject: patch to have root fs on USB device (please CC)

It simply sleeps 10 seconds before mount_block_root().
I get an 'Unable to mount root' panic if I don't apply it,
because the attached device rolls in too late.
Same for FireWire, but that's currently out of reach because
I must run rescan-scsi-bus.sh from user space to make the
disk visible as /dev/sd?  (to be fixed soon??).
Same for all hotpluggable storage devices I suppose.
Of course that patch is really terribly wrong, maybe someone
will fix these things some day.
Please CC, I'm not on the list.
