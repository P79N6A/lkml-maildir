That is interesting, indeed.. If that holds up then I assume some other 
change in 2.6.20-rc is either causing or triggering this problem. It 
would be useful if you could try git bisect between 2.6.19 and 
2.6.20-rc5, keeping the latest sata_nv.c each time, and see if that 
gives any indication. If not, just trying some of the different 
2.6.20-rcX versions may be useful.
Before that, though, can you try making this change I suggested below in 
2.6.20-rc5 and see if the problem still shows up?
