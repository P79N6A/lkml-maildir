If we look at set/get_fpu_xxx in i386 and x86-64, their codes are not
consistent; functions vs. macros. This is mainly because x86-64 can
assume the modern CPU features are available, and thus those are
simplified. 
It's not required to make mxcsr_feature_mask global on i386 because
nobody else is using it in other files, but I agree that it would be
better to make it global to avoid potential confusion/mistakes in the
future.

If we do this, then we should check if we can remove other (unused)
set/get_fpu_xxx to make i386 and x86-64 more consistent. For example,
set/get_fpu_fwd() are not used as far as I checked.
