I don't think it's safe to check css_under_removal here w/o cgroup_lock.
(It's safe *NOW* just because memcg is the only user of css->refcnt.)
As Li said before, css_under_removal doesn't necessarily mean
this this group has been destroyed, but mem_cgroup will be freed.
But adding cgroup_lock/unlock here causes another dead lock,
because mem_cgroup_get_next_node calls mem_cgroup_put.
hmm.. hierarchical reclaim code will be re-written completely by [21/21],
so would it be better to change patch order or to take another approach ?
Thanks,
Daisuke Nishimura.
