| Summary of features:
| - staircase7.4 scheduler
|
| - batch scheduling
|
| - isochronous scheduling
|
| - autoregulated swappiness
|
| - autotuned vm page inactivation
|
| - supermount-ng
|
| - default cfq I/O scheduler
|
| - config hz
|
| - bootsplash v3.14
|
|
| Changed:
| - Updated staircase scheduler. Significant bugfixes and improvements
| have been made to the staircase scheduler since v7 that was in 2.6.7-ck1
| and updating is highly recommended. See separate announcement on lkml.
|
| Added:
| - autotuned vm page inactivation
| This extends the functionality of the autoregulated swappiness to now
| bias the active/inactive ratio according to the percentage of physical
| ram used by application pages. It has the effect of avoiding swap much
| more effectively, and drastically reducing the time spent in swap-thrash
| scenarios over and above the effectiveness of the autoregulated
| swappiness. The 2 are rolled into one sysctl which allows them to be
| disabled together (on by default) at /proc/sys/vm/autoregulate
|
| - default cfq i/o scheduler
| Self explanatory
|
| - config hz
| Self explanatory
|
| - bootsplash
| See www.bootsplash.org
|
|
|
| A full set of split-out patches are available with a series that can be
| used with the quilt application.
|
|
| The FAQ on my web page have also been updated.
|
| Comments, questions, suggestions welcome.
