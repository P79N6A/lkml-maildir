Thanks - I appreciate that.
Just to catch everyone up on what this thread is
about, I'm proposing a new way of looking at file
systems where files no longer have permission, owners,
or groups, or file attributes. The idea is that
people, groups, managers, applications, and other
objects have permissions to names that are pointers to
files.

My proposal is the same somewhat. If one put
restricting on a specific name to deny access to users
then that denial follows that filename even if it is
copied or moved. However if a file has no specific
restrictions and is in a restricted directory then the
file inherits the restrictions and permissions of the
new directory based on where it is.
If you don't want your jewlery laying around then
don't put a copy of it in a folder where users have
access to it.
