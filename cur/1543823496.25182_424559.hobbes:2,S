I have been too obsessed with the other issues to remember.

Admittedly, I didn't, but merely believed the comment above the function.

sheds some light.
I would be happy to exploit an API that may result from that discussion.
I would plead for exporting such an API to modules. I don't see how
to implement statistics for latencies, otherwise.
Any other hints on how to replace my sched_clock() calls are welcome.
(I want to measure elapsed times in units that are understandable to
users without hardware manuals and calculator, such as milliseconds.)
