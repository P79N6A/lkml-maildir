Subject: [VFS-EXPORTS] Why generic_forget_inode() is not exported?

Hello,
I have a question about EXPORTS in VEFS:
if sb->drop_inode method is set, than it's called in iput_final().
But it's impossible to call neither generic_drop_inode(), nor 
generic_forget_inode() inside this handler. Only generic_delete_inode() 
is accessiable.
why generic_delete_inode() is exported and generic_forget_inode() is not?
It looks like it should. At least, from VFS interface point of view.
