You're going to make lots of IETFer's really annoyed by suggesting that :-)
Honestly, there are lots of other ways to solve this, and it would be nice 
if the IETF's recent additions got implemented; there are many relevant 
things going on there.  Those interested should just talk to the draft 
authors about implementing things.  It's an open organisation just like 
linux-kernel after all, just a bit more formal.
In a closed network, why not have SOCK_STREAM map to something faster than 
TCP anyway?  That is, if I connect(address matching localnet), SOCK_STREAM 
maps to (eg) SCTP.  That would be a far more dramatic performance hack!
