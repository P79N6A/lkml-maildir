Hi there,
I am one of the people having problems with the eepro 100... Here is my
output at dmesg time...
eth0: Intel EtherExpress Pro 10/100 at 0xd000, 00:90:27:9D:0D:6B, IRQ 10.
  Receiver lock-up bug exists -- enabling work-around.
  Board assembly 721383-007, Physical connectors present: RJ45
  Primary interface chip i82555 PHY #1.
  General self-test: passed.
  Serial sub-system self-test: passed.
  Internal registers self-test: passed.
  ROM checksum self-test: passed (0x04f4518b)
This is what appears in the /var/log/messages when it goes mad....

This continues ad infinitum.... I tried the patched driver in 2.2.15pre3
and that gave a different error. IT said out of memory... 
Normally with the error above I can get control of the machine via a
serial console and reboot it. However with the new kernel, I can't even
get the serial console up.
One other thing on the topic of serial consoles. I have a serial console
setup to a box. I have added the line to /etc/inittab and I am using the
same kernel as I am using on one of my other boxes. The other box's serial
console works fine. However on this box, I go into minicom and hit enter.
I then get a login prompt and type a user name. It then never comes back
with a password prompt. On the other box I get a password prompt
immediately and am able to login. Is there something that I haven't
installed that is causing this ?
Thanks a stack!
