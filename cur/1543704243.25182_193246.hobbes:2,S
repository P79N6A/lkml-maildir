I has hacking on swsusp2 to ppc for whole day. Here is the update
swsusp2-asm.S.
First I can true suspend is ok, the data and CPU context are full write
to disk. Then in resume, the copyback function works.
How I know it?
 I'm adding printk before do_swsusp2_lowleve finished, I has printf 
the r1, That is the pointer to cpu context, it must right on resume,
when resume it'll triger xmon, I d pm_sleep_storage, and check the 
pointer, I see that same things, So I true the copyback is ok, at least 
the cpu context memory has backed.
very tire day.
The current problem that is, In resume, It stop with all register
(r0-r32) is zero. I don't known where I am. :)
