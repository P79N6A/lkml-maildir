On a closely related note:  I just now submitted a patch to fix SMP-poweroff,
by having it do disable_nonboot_cpus before doing poweroff.
Which has led me to thinking..
..are similar precautions perhaps necessary for *all* ACPI BIOS calls?
Because one never knows what the other CPUs are doing at the same time,
and what the side effects may be on the ACPI BIOS functions.
And also, I wonder if at a minimum we should be guaranteeing ACPI BIOS calls
only ever happen from CPU#0 (or the "boot" CPU)?   Or do we do that already?
