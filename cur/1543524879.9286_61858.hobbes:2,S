My local computer store hardware guy tells me that Athlon-500's have
problems, and heavily advises the 700 and above (and not just to pad his
bottom line :))
He mentioned one trick -- make sure you have at least 32MB of AGP'able
video memory, if you have an Athlon 500.  If you have less, many
motherboards malfunction apparently.
Again, this problem isn't present on Athlon 700 and above, or so he
says.
