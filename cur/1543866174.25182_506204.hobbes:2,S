The greater has to include the lesser. If you have the authority to remove or modify a copyright enforcement scheme, you cannot be circumventing it.
In any event, if your argument were correct, the Linux kernel would not be distributable. The license enforcement scheme in the kernel makes it unlawful to modify the modules in a particular way, and they are both distributed under the GPL. This would be a "further restriction" since the restriction is not found in the GPL itself.
> Changing the source (allowed by the GPL) is not circumvention.
Then you can change the module source to include a null in the license tag.

And neither is breaking down your own door. If you have the right to remove the door, you have the right to break it down. The greater includes the lesser.

Sounds like a further restriction to me. This is a restriction on how the modules can be modified, it's not found in the GPL, and it was imposed by people who modified the kernel. This is exactly what the GPL was designed to force people to remove before they could distribute a work.

Right, but you can't put something into your source such that someone removing it or modifying it is breaking the law. If there was a law that said a file could not be modified if someone put the words "DO NOT MODIFY" in it, then you could *not* put such words in a GPL'd work. If you did, such a work would not be distributable because the law imposes a further restriction.
The DMCA is no different. It's a law that says if you put a copyright enforcement scheme in a work, then someone can't circumvent it. Since there are no anti-circumvention rules in the GPL itself, it's a further restriction.
Simply put, if you assume this is a license enforcement scheme, then the Linux kernel together with some modules contains a further restriction that prohibits you from modifying the modules in ways allowed by the GPL. This is precisely what the GPL prohibits.

You are missing the point of the example. This is an example of what happens when some kind of legal process not found in the GPL operates to restrict the rights guaranteed by the GPL.

I cannot see any rational way you can have the right to modify all the involved code, the right to remove the scheme, and yet you can be "circumventing" it.
> Note that this particular scheme doesn't even try to prevent copying.
That's simply not true. It makes some proprietary modules unusable on mainstream kernels, thus decreasing the value of them if they're distributed. This is exactly what many anti-copying schemes do.
How is this scheme (which makes mainstream kernels unable to work with modules that are not GPL-licensed) different from the DVD scheme (that makes unlicensed players unable to play mainstream DVDs)? Engineered incompatability restricts the distribution value of the items made incompatible.

If you choose the GPL, you lose the right to "make it harder" for people to distribute and modify code. The GPL sets the terms and is carefully constructed so that nobody can later change them.

This is precisely the type of thing the GPL was designed to prohibit. You are not supposed to be able to abuse copyright to retain control over a GPL'd work.
