Ok, next bug, introduced by this change:
commit f565913ef8a8d0cfa46a1faaf8340cc357a46f3a
Author: Jens Axboe <jens.axboe@oracle.com>

    block: convert to using sg helpers
    Convert the main rq mapper (blk_rq_map_sg()) to the sg helper setup.
    Signed-off-by: Jens Axboe <jens.axboe@oracle.com>
Specifically this part:
 new_segment:
-			memset(&sg[nsegs],0,sizeof(struct scatterlist));
-			sg[nsegs].page = bvec->bv_page;
-			sg[nsegs].length = nbytes;
-			sg[nsegs].offset = bvec->bv_offset;
+			sg = next_sg;
+			next_sg = sg_next(sg);
+			sg->page = bvec->bv_page;
+			sg->length = nbytes;
+			sg->offset = bvec->bv_offset;
You can't remove that memset(), it's there for a reason.  The IOMMU
layers depended upon the code zero'ing out the whole scatterlist
struct, there might be more to it than page, length and offset :-)
In sparc64's case, this zero'd the dma_address and dma_length members
and the mapping algorithms use that to their advantage.
