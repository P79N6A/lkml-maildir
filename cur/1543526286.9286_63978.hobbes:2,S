Subject: shmat on non-NULL address?

According to the man page for shmat, supplying a non-NULL shmaddr
(with or without asserting SHM_RND) should attach a shared memory
segment to the address. However, the shmat call always fails unless
supplied with a NULL shmaddr. I quickly perused the sys_shmat function
in linux/ipc/shm.c (RedHat 6.1, kernel 2.2.5) and could not tell if
non-NULL behavior is even implemented. Would someone who is more
knowledgeable about shared memory than I tell me if it is possible to
attach an existing address to shared memory? Thanks.
