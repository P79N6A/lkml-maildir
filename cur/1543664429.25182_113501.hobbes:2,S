The Generic Address Structure (GAS) is basically a 64 bit address and a
type field. The type can be:
System memory
System IO
PCI Config space
Embedded Controller
SMBus
Functional fixed hardware
I don't think this will very easily handle a clean request/release API.
Corey, what is the specific table you are concerned with? At least with
the GASes ACPI uses internally, they point to resource regions already
marked as used via other means (e820 or _CRS, for example.)
