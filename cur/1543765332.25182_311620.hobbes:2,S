Yep, it takes very little to achieve that -- to allow multiple checked-
out trees from a single object database. Petr's already outlined what it
takes.

If I use git in my home directory I cannot _help_ but share it.
Sometimes I'm using it from a BE box, sometimes from a LE box. Should I
really be forced to use separate checkouts for each type of machine?
It's bad enough having to do that for ~/bin :)
Seriously, it shouldn't have a significantly detrimental effect on the
performance if we just use explicitly sized types and fixed byte-order.
It's just not worth the pain of being gratuitously non-portable.
