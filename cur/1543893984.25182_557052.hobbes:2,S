I'd say this is unfair, but if it can happen, then maybe the small
company could have been more careful about the regulations.  There are
various ways to prevent these changes that don't involve imposing
restrictions of modification on any software in the device, all the
way from hardware-constrained output power to hardware-verified
authorized configuration parameters.

When this doesn't bring freedom to people, when people can't actually
enjoy the freedoms that the software is supposed to provide, I don't
see why this would be a good thing.  What's the merit in being able to
claim "vendor X chose my Free Software and locked it down such that
users don't get the freedoms I meant for them, and I'm happy about it?"
