That one is default. Recent kernels (since 2.6.12 or so, I think when 
the default on-link assumption was killed) have a default route pointing 
to "unreachable default lo" on bootup. Routes learned from RA or added 
statically are installed with a better metric and are preferred that way.
I think the use is to have a Network unreachable returned immediately if 
no IPv6 router is present.
