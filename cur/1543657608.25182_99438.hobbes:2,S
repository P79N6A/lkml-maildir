indeed. that doesnt change the fact that this large body of NVidia
specific code still must make use of large parts of linux code
(through function calls).

yes, but the legalities of it are rather grey.

indeed, and if that were the only issue it would be clear there is no 
issue. however, it must make use of linux code at runtime through 
function calls - as linux makes use of the NVidia proprietary code by 
calling the functions it provides.

I run systems that use many GPL and fully open drivers that are quite
well optimised. Some of these drivers were written by the vendor's
"experts" and are distributed seperately - still GPL though.  
Sometimes one has a choice between drivers written by the vendor and
drivers written by (non-expert???) "community" authors, and often one
finds the vendor driver is the one that isn't terribly optimised.

none of this stuff is done in kernel (least it shouldnt be). Its done 
in user-space libraries.
The XFree licence allows binary only modules, indeed XFree 4 was 
designed to make distribution of (possibly binary) modules as easy as 
possible.
There isnt that much magic the NVidia kernel modules ought to be 
doing really.

aha.. yes, all that complicated hardware stuff - you dont really want 
those linux kernel amatuers writing that.
