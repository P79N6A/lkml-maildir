Hi Andrew and all
Just tried to compile the kernel with the 'allyesconfig' when I stumbled 
on this one (have not seen any reports on this one, otherwise sorry for 
the blotter):
  CHK     usr/initramfs_list
  CC      sound/oss/sonicvibes.o
sound/oss/sonicvibes.c:421: error: static declaration of ‘hweight32’ follows non-static declaration
include/asm-generic/bitops/hweight.h:6: error: previous declaration of ‘hweight32’ was here
make[2]: *** [sound/oss/sonicvibes.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [sound/oss] Error 2
make: *** [sound] Error 2
I am not sure why it tries to make its own hweight32() so I just 
disabled it:

BTW, I do not have the hardware, so it is just building-tested.
