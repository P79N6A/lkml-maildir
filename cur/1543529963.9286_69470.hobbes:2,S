I was the one complaining about the tests Chris is referring to - but my
complaint wasn't that the ReiserFS guys had failed to nuke the code, or
were being less than thorough. Rather, I just pointed out these tests
didn't address the original complaint at all - they were the wrong tests
to begin with.

I hope not - there wouldn't be much kernel left if that were strictly
applied :-)

A journalling FS would definitely be a desirable feature. ISTR the VFS
update is being worked on now - with that done, the FS should be OK for
inclusion?
Personally, I want to see ReiserFS included as soon as possible - provided
it can be done cleanly.

Any idea of relative timescale for 2.4.0 vs. fixing ReiserFS? ISTR someone
suggested a week or so for ReiserFS having the VFS layer fixed - is this
realistic, and could this make it into the kernel early enough for 2.4.0??
Sorry if I seemed a bit hostile to ReiserFS earlier in the week - quite
the opposite, I want to see it in - but not before it is ready.
James.
