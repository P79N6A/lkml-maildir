hm, Linux has no such message. Do you get this 'Memory error or NMI' when
the BIOS does the RAM check? This could be a fault in a RAM chip being
triggered by high DMA traffic. Sporadic reboots in the 2.2.latest kernel
line are almost certainly a sign of hardware error. (it could also be
overheating of any hw component: RAM, motherboard, CPU or disk)
