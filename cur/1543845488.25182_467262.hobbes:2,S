What does "has a hardcoded return value" mean?
AFICT the problem here is that (for example) (going up the call stack in
the callee->caller direction):
scsi_internal_device_block() returns an error code
but device_block() drops that on the floor
so target_block() drops it on the floor too
so scsi_target_block() drops it on the floor too
It's a small matter of (correct kernel) programming to correctly propagate
the scsi_internal_device_block() error code all the way back out of
scsi_target_block().
It all looks rather sloppy?
