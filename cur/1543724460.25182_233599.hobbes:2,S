Yeah, now that you mention it I see the mail from Go Taniguchi, missed it
before.
I can confirm his findings. I just now grabbed that cset as a diff and
backed it out of 2.6.7-mm7 and that fixes the problem.
Now all we need it someone knowledgable about the changes made by that
cset to review it and find out exactely what causes the breakage.
