Exactly! Although I had a lot of positive experiences in connection with mm-tree bug fixing. Ask Andrew if you do not believe.

You are definitely right.

Yes. But I am the last one to avoid a "thank you" or "well done" if I notice that I have met someone doing a pretty good job! Positive motivation, OK?

Of course. But the one in question @linuxtv.org is extreme as far as this is concerned.

a. I am good-looking too. If you doubt, ask my women, (yes plural!) they will agree.
b. Apart from the sarcastical background of that statement your biggest fault is that you have been publishing horrible kernels since December 2006. The speed (1 release candidate almost every week) is too high, completely insane.
The result is crap code as hell in official release candidates.
To get those regressions fixed you feel like a hamster in a running wheel.
It simply feels inhuman, like a robot.
I remember Michael Krufky posting something like: "Linus, this code needs more testing". And your answer was: "Too late, already being pushed!"
See, Linus, you cannot go on like this, so please slow down now, man!
I can very well understand Andrew asking me to test the mm-tree which conforms to something like a filter system for buggy code. But when should I do this if I need a machine running for 10 hours to wait that the "hopefully" last regression in kernel 2.6.20 can be identified? And fixed by Bart or Alan hopefully?
And if I cannot even trust in the fact that an official rc is sane, how should I or anybody else draw conclusions which module or which hunks are faulty then in some mm-tree? And I still do not know how to do git bisecting. Never done that.
You cannot test the quality of the roof of a house if its fundament is faulty and buggy like hell, can you?? SLOW DOWN MAN!

I guess I can see through the problem.

Who is Al Viro and Christoph? The two examples of the reproduction of your personal genetic code I suppose?

Maybe. The power of prejudice.
But, as I stated already: There is nothing that I hate more than people providing an opinion towards everything but, at the same time, no behaviour towards nothing - they are a pest, they are a cholera, they are a disease.

But, dear Linus, the facts stay:
1. A maintainer who produces 4 unusable kernels and, at the same time discourages capable contributors is a mismatch. So substitution is the only solution for the person in question. Even then if there will be a gap for some time.
2. I pick up the things necessary for me and want to share them by trying to get them implied into vanilla, but they are still waiting for a signature which is an act of 10 minutes or even 5 minutes. And that is the incredible thing that cannot go on like this, can it?
3. If I would have enough knowledge in some dvb terms I would volunteer for being maintainer without hesitation.
But my personal advantages are rather more situated in profound knowledge about music and linguistics.
Yours sincerely
Uwe
Once again, please: Slow down the kernel release speed!
