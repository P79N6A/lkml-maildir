But it is (hopefully) a one-time change.

Your "simple bitfields" :)
But on the note of readability; there is in no way any constraints to 
only use 'false'/'true'. Right now I'm converting some files who already 
uses FALSE/TRUE and may change 0/1 for consitency.
But I think it all boils down to what people are used to (I don't think 
there are any C++/Java-developers who complains about boolean and 
false/true). I am not too concerned about 0/1 being used or false/true, 
but the proper use of booleans and values.

Actually I find it to be simpler. Which would you chose?:
u8 a:1;
or
int a:1;
for a value? But if 'a' is a statement, then we just use:
bool a:1 (if the size of the variable is of relevance, otherwise just 
"bool a"). (You know what the variables are going to be used for when 
declaring them, right??)
Btw, how do you know if "a += 1" is just used to flip 'a's value or if 
it is a bug (in the case of boolean)?
