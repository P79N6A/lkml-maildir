	It's a good idea, and should have the advantages you cited. My only
concern is that each task watcher would have to (un)register multiple
notifier blocks. I expect that in most cases there would only be two.
Also, if we apply this to per-task notifiers it would mean that we'd
have a 6 raw notifier heads per-task.
	Would you like me to redo the patches as multiple chains? Alternately,
I could produce patches that apply on top of the current set.
Cheers,
