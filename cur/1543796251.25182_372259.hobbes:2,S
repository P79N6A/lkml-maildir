Hi
Is there any plans about making a kthread_create_on_cpu() version of 
kthread_create(), so that memory allocated for thread stack/info is allocated 
on the node of the target CPU ?
There is a mention about kthread_create_on_cpu() in a comment in 
include/linux/kthread.h, but no implementation.
The current use pattern is
p = kthread_create(ksoftirqd, hcpu, "ksoftirqd/%d", hotcpu);
if (IS_ERR(p)) { error ... }
kthread_bind(p, hotcpu);
So the thread memory is currently allocated on the node of the current cpu, ie 
not the target cpu (hotcpu in this example)
Thank you
Eric Dumazet
