Dear,  
RE: YOUR ASSISTANCE IS HIGHLY NEEDED.
I am very sure that this mail will bring lots of surprises and curiosity to you since there was no previous correspondence before now between us.I am the widow of one of the top rulers in Chechnya, My husband died along side with the Chenchan president who was killed in a bomb attack early this year in a parade ground.
My husband told me before his death that he has a deposit of $28.8m which he deposited overseas and handed to me all the documents which my lawyer has confirmed with the bank. 
Right now I am looking for an Investor who will help me to invest the total sum in the west and after which I will relocate to your country.The security situation in Chechnya does not warrant me to do much from here; therefore I have designated my family lawyers who will co ordinate every aspect of the fund transfer and the investment   with your assistance.
I am ready to concede up to 25% of the funds to you as your share if you will help me to pull the funds and invest it in your country which has a stable economy.
Upon receipt of your acceptance letter to my private mail box quoted above, I will introduce you to my family lawyer for details on how the transfer can be done in the shortest possible time.
Awaiting your Urgent response via MY DIRECT EMAIL ADDRESS   stated BELOW.
                             katarina.igor@atlas.cz
Regards,
MRS. KATARINA IGOR.
