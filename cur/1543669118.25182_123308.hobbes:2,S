ok, based on messing around this morning with this, here's what
i've found.
(first, apologies to andrew morton; when i said his patch applied
on top of bk12, i was just confused.  it's a "battle tactic". :-)
all of this is based on my RH 9 (shrike) box, running on a dell
inspiron 8100.
first, the rpm flaw exists using all three variations of the
kernel i tested:
  2.5.66
  2.5.66-bk12
  2.5.66-bk12-mm (bk12 minus andrew's filemap patch)
the interesting part is that doing something simple like "rpm -q rpm"
works for a non-root user; it fails only when root tries it, even
though the operation is only a query.  go figure.
next, backing out from rpm-4.2-0.69 to rpm-4.2-0.66 didn't seem to
fix the problem (at least, not for me -- a previous poster claimed
that it fixed it for him, but it didn't solve the problem here).
finally, using:
  LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5 rpm -q rpm
solves the problem (at least under the 2.5.66-bk12-mm kernel i'm
running at the moment -- i'll assume it does the same under the
others).
take whatever you can get from this.

p.s.  more 2.5.66-bk12 oddities coming up shortly
