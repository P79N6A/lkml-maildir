If the comment that this doesn't work with the stable kernel is correct, I
consider that a pretty major flaw. Unlike the kernel and NGPT which are
developed using an open source model with lots of eyes on the WIP, this
was done and then released whole with the decision to include it in the
standard library already made. Having any part of glibc not work with the
current stable kernel doesn't seem like such a hot idea, honestly.

Is there a performance comparison with current pthreads and NGPT and more
typical levels of 5-10k threads as seen on news/mail/dns/web servers?
Eliminating overhead is good, but in most cases there just isn't all that
much overhead in NGPT. I haven't measured Linux threads, but there are a
lot of bad urban legends about them ;-)

Of course not, it's coincidence that only Redhat has these things readily
available, perhaps because this was developed where no other vendor knew
it existed and could have support ready for it.
Modulo my comments on not putting things in libraries which don't widely
work, this souncds as if it is less complex and hopefully more stable (not
that NGPT isn't) and lower maintenence. I'd love to see comparisons of the
three libraries under some typical load, how about a Redhat DNS server
running threaded bind? Run a day with each library and look at response
time, load average, and of course stability.
