great!
meanwhile i spent an afternoon with another latency testing suite:
  
http://www.alsa-project.org/~iwai/latencytest-0.5.3.tar.gz
it was reporting more accurate latencies, except that there were strange
spikes of latencies. It turned out that for whatever reason, userspace
RDTSC is not always reliable on my box (!).
I've attached two fixes against latencytest - one makes rdtsc timestamps
more reliable, the other one fixes an SMP bug in the kernel module (it
would lock up under SMP otherwise.).
here's a latencytest QuickStart: 'cd latencytest; make', then
'insmod kernel/latency-test.ko', then 'cd tests; ../bin/run_tests'.  
Assuming you have RTC and audio enabled in your kernel it should work 
fine. It produces PNGs in the same format as Benno's latencytest suite.
