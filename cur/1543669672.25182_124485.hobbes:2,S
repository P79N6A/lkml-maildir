Ok, but that still leaves the race between creation and removal of devices
files. In my scenario three different bad things can happen:
- The file is removed after the device is added
- The file is added when the device is already unplugged again
- The file gets added with the wrong device number -> worst case
This can be avoided by completely serializing all events, both inside
the kernel and the execution of /sbin/hotplug,  but that might cause
significant downtime.
