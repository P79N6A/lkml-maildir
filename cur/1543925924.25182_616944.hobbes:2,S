Let me have a doubt, considering that the last public -mm kernel was
released over a month ago (October 12th), which is before your previous
pull request (October 14th). I don't think that any of these patches
has been in even one public -mm tree, so in practice they probably
didn't receive any public testing at all.
Now let's hope that nothing breaks.
