You don't need CMPXCHG8B to do efficient inline mutexes.  In fact, the
pthreads code for i386 uses the same mutexes the kernel does (LOCK INC
based, I believe), complete with section hacking to make them
efficiently inlinable -- and then they're put inside a function call.
I believe "kill me now" is an appropriate response.
