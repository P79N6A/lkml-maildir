That would make sense, I guess.

Me too.  I use 1000 to get my 50MB of pagecache back.
I haven't thought about it yet, but there must be some way to avoid leaving
huge amounts of lowmem free.  It should be OK to allow lowmem to be fully
used, as long as there's sufficent reclaimable stuff in there - slab,
blockdev pagecache, etc.  (Assuming nothing sane mmaps blockdevs.  INND
does).  Dunno....
