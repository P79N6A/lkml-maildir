Hello,
  I compiled 2.5.2 and rebooted and my swap no longer
works.  swapon returns happy but 'free' show 0 swap
and /proc/swap is empty.  if i reboot to 2.4.17 swap
is back.  Since i can't find any like this in the list
archives i'm guessing it is something i did.
if anyone could help me i would appreciate it.
Thanks,
joe rice
