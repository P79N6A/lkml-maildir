I don't think there ever were any 2.2.0-testX patches - my recollection is
that we went from 2.1.1xx to 2.2.0-preX, with no -testX in between like we
seem to be having now.
In other words, if I understand things correctly, once we have Linux 
2.4.0-test4294967296 ;) and 2.4 is stable enough for the last phase of
testing before release, 2.4.0-pre1 will be next...
