Don't know if this is a similar problem or not, but I'm been getting very
strange behavior with the tulip driver when typing in a telnet session..
(I am doing this right now actually)
I'll get like half second, to second delays after I type a character and
when it actually appears on the screen.  I used to use a ne2k card, and
never saw this behavior, so I'm pretty sure it's a driver problem...
I can try the 2.3.48 kernel to see if it exhibits the same problem...
