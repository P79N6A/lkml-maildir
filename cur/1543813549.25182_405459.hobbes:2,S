Going back to that mysterious idle time fluctuation problem, I just noticed
something interesting here:

Look, the real time artifacts show up in the same places in the two
different runs.  There was a reboot before each run.  There is a sync
before  and after each trial.  Each trial was initiated by hand, so this
isn't about something else going on in the machine at the same time.
Got to be a clue in there somewhere.
Regards,
Daniel
