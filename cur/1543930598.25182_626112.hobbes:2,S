The resolution of mtime/ctime may be too low since some filesystems sets
them in unit of a second, which means you cannot detect the changes made
within a second.
I think it is better to use inotify for every directory while it
consumes a little more resources.
Additionally, if you implement vm_operations instead of
struggling along address_space_operations or VFS patches, in order to
share the mmap-ed memory pages between lower inode and unionfs inode,
then most of issues will be gone.
You can see this approach and how it is working in 
http://aufs.sf.net
(and get the source file from CVS).
But I am afraid the approach sharing memory pages will not be avaiable
for ecryptfs.
