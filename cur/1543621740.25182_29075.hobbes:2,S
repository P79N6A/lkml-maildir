Not exactly. It does check for 'is_sony_vaio_laptop' variable.
The check for the pci device is just an additionnal clue on the kind
of sonypi device you have.
Does your kernel print a line:
	Sony Vaio laptop detected.
on boot ? I suppose not, and that would explain the sonypi init failure.
Could you send me the output of dmidecode ?
