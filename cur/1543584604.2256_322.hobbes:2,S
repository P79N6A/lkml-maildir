Yeah, that works.  But I'm not all that interested in compiling UML 
differently for UP and SMP hosts.

This looks a lot better.  For UML, if there's a thread spinning on a lock, 
there has to be a runnable thread holding it, and that thread will get a 
timeslice before the spinning one (assuming that the thread holding the lock 
hasn't called a blocking system call, which is something that I intend to make 
sure can't happen).

OK, that makes sense.
