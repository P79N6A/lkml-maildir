I have had no problems burning CD-Rs in the 2.3/2.4 series but
I have my Yamaha 4416S on a different adapter from my main
disk.

Ouch, that seems like a problem. Cdrecord doesn't queue commands to
my knowledge (haven't checked the last few alphas) so that will
probably be IO to your disk queued up behind it. The Yamaha 4416S
neither supports disconnect nor tagged queueing.

Agreed.

Well the "jerkiness" has been a latter 2.3 series "feature" that
we don't think the SCSI subsystem is responsble for. Happily
this seems to be improving in the 2.4.0-test3-pre series.
In your case, if the cdwriter monopolizes the SCSI bus which
contains your disks for over a minute, it's no surprise that
your system may be a little unresponsive for that period.
The system being completely DEAD for 30 seconds is "normal" 
when a SCSI bus reset occurs on an all SCSI system. The typical
response to a timeout is a SCSI bus reset.

#define SD_TIMEOUT (30 * HZ)
    [from drivers/scsi/sd.c]

Yes, having a second SCSI controller would certainly help. Even 
something like an old aha1542 (16 bit ISA) would help. Leave your 
disks on the current adapter and move the ZIP drive and especially 
the 4416S.
