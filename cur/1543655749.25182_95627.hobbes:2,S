This is now the case in 2.5-mm - bdflush() is deprecated and will print
a stern warning on use.
I suspect this will move to mainline shortly.

Yes, Evolution is broken.  The problem is actually ORBit.  I have talked
to Elliot Lee about this and we are not sure whether it is the kernel's
or ORBit's fault.  I originally thought it was ORBit's, but it is
looking like the kernel's to be honest.  The behavior of getpeername()
wrt to sun_path seems to of changed.  If any networking hacker wants to
look into it, please do :)
In the mean time, you CAN fix the problem by patching ORBit.  I have a
patch and RPM packages available at:

Which works just fine for me.
