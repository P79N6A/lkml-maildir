I just mentioned the previous problem because the behaviour was pretty
much the same as before, long times of no TCP traffic, intermittent
freezes apparently of all the processes trying to do IO to the disk.

It appears (purely speculation, no hard facts to back it up) related to
memory pressure, it doesn't happen with smaller files (my laptop has
512Mb) and it happens less often on the second copy if the file fits on
cache.

I'm running 2.6.7, are the changes contained in 2.6.8-rc(something)? I
cant try them or an -mm kernel if you prefer.
