My RaptorNT 6.5 firewall rejects all connections from my linux box when ECN
is enabled.  The error is attached.  Perhaps this feature should be disabled
by default?  Or is there already an option of the sort that i'm missing?  I
only got the idea to disable it after a search of linux-kernel.
Plz cc me, I"m not on the list.
Later!
