Hi,
I have a UDP client which send packet to an echo server and receive the
same packet back. Most time it works fine. But some time the recvfrom
call is hanging without returning anything, even no error return. I set
the alarm signal try to break the recvfrom and reach to next step in
process.  It doesn't work. I also tried to send a SIGPIPE signal to that
same process, but the recvfrom is still hanging.
Please help if you know anything about this! I appreciate it.
Thanks!
Tracy
