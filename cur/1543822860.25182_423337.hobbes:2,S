Btw, on the face it of, I really think that this patch is correct 
regardless of any other issues.
We're clearly getting rid of "disk->driverfs_dev" (that's what the 
"put_device()" does). So we should clear it out - using 
"disk->driverfs_dev" afterwards is clearly not _valid_, because we've 
dropped the reference.
Of course, we shouldn't assign zero to it. We should assign NULL. 
Alternatively, we could poison it (so that anybody who tries to use it 
gets a nice oops ASAP).
Now, regardless of whether that is correct or not, it might not be the 
only problem, of course. It sounds like there is something else going on 
here too.
