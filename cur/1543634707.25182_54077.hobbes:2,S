This is a known issue. The following patch to fix it is already in
Marcelos BK reporsitory (which means that the fix will be in -pre11/-rc1):
# --------------------------------------------
# 02/06/07	akpm@zip.com.au	1.537.1.44
# [PATCH] Remove debug code from /proc/stat
#
# This patch removes a piece of debug code which crept into the kernel
# by accident.
