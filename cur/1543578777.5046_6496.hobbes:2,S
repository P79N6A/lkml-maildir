IIRC xprt_lock is there for 2 purposes:
  - serialize access to the TCP connect code
  - gate access to the *socket* via the xprt_(up|down)_transmit() (and
    hence setting xprt->snd_task which is a pointer to the task that
    currently is allowed to access the socket.)
Those 2 tasks are completely orthogonal to one another, so we should
be quite free to drop xprt_lock in the second case.
I can see no other places where we're using xprt_lock to protect a
sleep/wakeup of xprt->snd_task unless you're introducing it? If so for
what purpose?
Cheers,
  Trond
