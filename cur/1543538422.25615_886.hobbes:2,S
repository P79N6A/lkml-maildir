 The right thing? I don't think so. This doesn't fix anything. Processes
will still have to exit! How can this be tolerated in a multiuser
environement? Someone starts a memory hog process and the other
users in the system read in their terminal:
got SIGDANGER signal: exiting...
IMO you're only disguising the problem with this aproach, not fixing it.
Per user resource accounting is surely the right thing, and has been
proven to work on other UNIX systems.
