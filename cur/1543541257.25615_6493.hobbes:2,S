Greg,
I sent out a new message today that filtered out (hopefully all/most)
such false positives.  If you're going to poke around some more, it's
probably best to use it rather than the unannotated (and false positive
containing) tail end of my first message.  The heuristic: if there's
code from the kernel by the error messsage, its something I didn't see
as an obvious false positive.  Otherwise it could go either way.
Thanks for confirming the errors, and apologies for the time wasted
on the others.
Dawson
