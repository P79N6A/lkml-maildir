Hello Linus!
I am no kernel developer. But I understand what you are trying to tell 
here.
I agree that suspend to ram and snapshot should be handled differently by 
drivers. And unlike schedulers - whether it be I/O or process related 
ones - I think it should be quite easy to settle and decide on *one* 
implementation for each feature. It least it doesn't look as difficult as 
deciding on a scheduler which works for all the different workloads to 
me.
I do not believe that the reasons preventing this to happen until now are 
of pure technical nature.
I think snapshotting is a very important feature. I would patch it into my 
kernels if it was removed. But then I am using suspend2 anyway.
Regards,
