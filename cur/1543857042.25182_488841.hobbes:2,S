I also wondered why this patch should have the effect as it didn't seem in an area that should be 
important. I did test it on both 2.6.19-rc5-mm2 and vanilla 2.6.19. In both cases, it made 
interactive response improve.
One single task that seems to have the biggest effect on my unpatched systems is the link step for a 
new kernel. I am assuming that this process calls for lots of virtual memory. One other 
characteristic of my system when it gets unresponsive is that kswapd is running regularly; however, 
I have never observed any swap file usage.
