Hello Jeff,
thanks for the FAQ. Do you also have a link to
some FAQ not dealing with RAID and hotplug, but
explaining how to simply "coldplug" SATA drives?
I want to use them much in the same way like USB
disks can be used.
I picked up some fragments about /sys/class/scsi_host
scans and some /sbin/sata (script?) but I could not
find any more details or howtos.
Dieter.
