OK. You are right, they are both trees. But the menu tree is different
from the dependency tree. I can see two reasons: 1. We expect the menu's
layout to reflect function rather than implementation. 2. Menu tree and
dependency tree are directed trees, but only the menu tree has a root
(i.e. _one_ root).

It doesn't really revert the dependency. It changes the path that the
user takes to enable interdependent options. Thereby it changes _how_
the configurator ensures (or rather, _should_ ensure) that dependencies
are fulfilled.

"select" would not be needed if the configurator wouldn't make an option
_invisible_ if it depends on another disabled option. It would be nice
if the option would stay visible (or better yet, would be optionally
visible) and had pointers to unfulfilled dependencies.
Or more generally spoken, "select" would not be needed if there were
other means to switch the configurator's UI to a layout that exposes
more details about dependencies. There is already such a UI mode which
fully exposes _fulfilled_ dependencies.
