I remember using devices which require this. Not recently.

The last time I tried, cdrecord was allowed to burn the first session of 
a multi-session CD as a user (with correct device permissions) but not 
to read the multisession info (current ISO size) to burn another 
session. I haven't tried it in the last few months, I changed my script 
to do something else. However, it really should work.
I will test this if you like, but I'm on 7x24 coverage this week and 
7x24 vacation after that, so not soon.
