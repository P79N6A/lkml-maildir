Actually I found this dead code back then (with gcc as well), though
it was not looked all that serious. I think I decided we may want to have that
just in case sector_t will become signed oneday or something like that.
(in 2.4 the block type is still signed long, for example).
As for why gcc is finding this, but scripts (e.g. smatch) do not is because
scripts generally know nothing about variable types, so they cannot tell
this comparison was always false (and since gcc can do this for long time
already, there is no point in implementing it in scripts anyway).
Bye,
