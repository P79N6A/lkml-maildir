Subject: [PATCH] NLS patch part 2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/7/29/80

This patch removes more unneeded code from the new NLS tables.  The
charset->unicode tables all have a section of zeroes at the begining of
the table.  Removing these and compensating in code saves 270k of source
code, plus some runtime memory savings.
