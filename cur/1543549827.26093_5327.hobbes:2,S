kswapd is perfectly capable of evicting clean pages and triggering any
necessary writeback of dirty filesystem data at this point, even if
there is no swap.  If there is truly nothing kswapd can do to recover
here, then we are truly OOM.  Otherwise, kswapd should be able to free
the required memory, providing that the PF_MEMALLOC flag allows it to
eat into a reserved set of free pages which nobody else can allocate
once physical free pages gets below a certain threshold.
