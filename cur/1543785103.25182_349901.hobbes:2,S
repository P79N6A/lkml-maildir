Hi,
I have a kernel module (kernel 2.6) where I have
opened multiple tcp connections. when there is no data
i want my process to sleep. For that i have added the
following code.
/* Initialise the wait q head */
  init_waitqueue_head(&VNICClientWQHead);
init_waitqueue_entry(&(currentMap->waitQ), current);
add_wait_queue(currentMap->sock->sk->sk_sleep,
&(currentMap->waitQ));
/* here currentMap is a structure containing tcp
conenction info for my module. There is a currentMap
for each tcp connection */
wait_event_interruptible_timeout(VNICClientWQHead,
                                 0, HZ * 100000);
I am not sure about the condition argument, 0. 
It is not working. How the condition is to be set here
so that whenever data is available on any socket (tcp
connection) the sleeping process gets waken up?
Could anyone please give some light on this?
Regards,
Mano
