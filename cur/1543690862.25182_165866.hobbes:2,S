I'm not sure whether you understand my intention.
Nothing will change, except that if you want to support all CPUs, you 
have to select all CPUs instead of 386.
My main intention is to get a clear user interface (user = person 
compiling the kernel) that suits everyone's needs and to put all the 
logic what to do when you plan to support several different CPUs into 
the kernel.
I don't like the current user interface that says "if you want to 
support both an Athlon and a Pentium 4 in your kernel use the Pentium III
option. And for better optimization, also check the "generic" option".
