We, CKRM, can put this on our stack, once we have settled how we are 
going to address the structural requirements that came out of the kernel 
summit.
As indicated above, this would mean to create a resource controller
and assign mask to them, which is not what we have done so far, as
our current controllers are more share focused. This should be a good 
excercise.
While we are on the topic, do you envision these sets to be somewhat 
hierarchical or simply a flat hierarchy ?
