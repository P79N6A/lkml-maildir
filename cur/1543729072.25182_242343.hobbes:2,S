3) stop making broken changes.
	You do stop fb from beeing loaded after drm
and thus break perfectly working setups during stable series.  And you
introduce indeterministic behaviour, and although I haven't looked at the
code because unlike every guideline tells you you didn't post it to do the
list, probably horribly broken code.
If you want pci_driver semantics - and apparently you do - move fbdev
and drm into a common driver or introduce a stub.  This was discussed to
death and all kinds of list and Kernel Summit and now please follow what
was agreed on instead of introducing subtile hacks.
