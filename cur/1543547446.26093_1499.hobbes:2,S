but it's slower (on SMP) and more error-prone to use threads. We have the
following task: 'use multiple contexts and share some state'. The 'share
everything' model overdoes this goal a bit. Why not share the *specific*
state that should be shared, and nothing more? The fact that this is
inconsistent across platforms is IMHO not a good excuse - it just shows
the mistaken concept that threads should be used for such tasks. You are
right about the semaphore part - i have plans to add a new type of
semaphore to Linux, which are not as complex as SysV semaphores and are
not persistent.
