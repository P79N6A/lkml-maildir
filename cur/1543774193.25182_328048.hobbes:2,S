[ 1 hour later ... ] the mystery is solved: i had a ~15 MB kernel image 
size due to various debugging options plus per-CPU tracing buffer at 
NR_CPUS=8. PAGEALLOC caused an extra +1MB of DMA-zone kernel footprint 
(the 4k granular kernel pagetables of 1 GB physical RAM), which was the 
final drop and depleted the DMA pool completely.
