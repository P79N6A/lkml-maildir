The exported functions shouldn't normally be declared static though, 
because that means that they will not be available to other modules in the 
built-in case.
So most likely the correct fix is to remove the "static". However, 
ixj_register() still doesn't seem to be used anywhere at all, at least not 
by in-tree modules.
