Ah, much better.  That seems to fix it.

I was working under the assumption that the spinlocks were needed.  But 
now I see that there are spinlocks in wait_for_completion.  You did get 
init_completion() and call_rcu() backwards, they would need to be the 
opposite order, I think.

Since just about all of these will be in modules at unload time, I'm 
thinking that the way it is now is better.  Otherwise, someone will mess 
it up.  IMHO, it's much more likely that someone doesn't handle the 
callback correctly than someone reused the value before the call that 
releases it returns.  I'd prefer to leave it the way it is now.
