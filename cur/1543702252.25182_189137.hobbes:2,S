Consider the long-range ramifications
if a device can also be a directory,  just "magically".
I'm not going to automatically diss the idea  (other than my
natural reaction above)  but please consider beyond the immediate hack.
It reminds me of AIX from the days when it ran on PCs.
They had this neat trick of  "hidden directories"  (for a different
purpose).   It looked like an executable,  but really was a
directory containing multiple executables for various platforms.
(This version of AIX also ran on the mainframe, AIX/386 and AIX/370.)
There were/are better ways of solving the problem they were addressing.
