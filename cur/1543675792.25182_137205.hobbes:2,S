In trying to figure out why this might be worse under 2.5 I took some
simple vmstat numbers under 2.4 and 2.5, this biggest difference is the
number of context switches.  Under 2.4, with the page loaded, but
otherwise idle, the system averages around 700/sec, and when I mouse
around the page I get 2000-3000/sec.
However, under 2.5, as I reported previously, I get 2000/sec all the
time, and 3000-4000 as I mouse around the page.
Would this be expected behavior?  Does 2.5 do something that would cause
more context switches that 2.4?  I have no idea if this would have any
impact at all, but it was the only difference I could observe in my
fairly simple testing of the two kernels.
Later,
Tom
