I think it's more to do with everyone being busy, and not considering
this important, which is understandable, this is a fringe
functionality, and almost nobody uses it.
Problems with my attitude probably stem from this fact.  This bug is
important to _me_, and I behave accordingly, ant that seems
inappropriate.
Dave, I really appreciate the work you do.  Please forgive my
impatience.
