Subject: [PATCH] swapoff atomic_inc_not_zero on mm_users
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/26/325

Now that we have atomic_inc_not_zero, it's more elegant for try_to_unuse
to use that on mm_users: doesn't actually matter at present, but safer to
be sure that once mm_users has gone to 0, nothing raises it for an instant.
