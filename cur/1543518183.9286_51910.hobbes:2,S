Which breaks horribly since /usr/include/net conflicts with
/usr/src/linux-2.4.15ac10/include/net on a RedHat 6.1 box :-(
It isn't much of a problem when building kernel modules, but trying to
build applications which need both the driver-specific include file
(e.g. linux/wancard.h) and generic include files (e.g. net/if_ppp.h)
will break.
