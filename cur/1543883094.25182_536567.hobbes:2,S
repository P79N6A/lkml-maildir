Well I was assuming you'd code this up in the driver not arbitarily - and
you need to do that for IRQ anyway. So something like
	writel(0xFFFFFFFF, &mdev->irq_mask);
	pci_mark_failed(pdev, PCI_TRY_REPLUG|PCI_TRY_D3);
	spin_unlock(&mylock);
	return -EXPLODED;
with pci_mark_failed firing off any replug via a work queue
