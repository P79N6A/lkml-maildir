I agree both of those make it all more fragile;
but I still don't quite see where it's broken.
The existing shortcuts are normally dealing with either a freed
page or a just allocated, not yet published, page.  And you're
right that the anon->swap case is an exception, less obvious.

Don't both of those TryLockPage (in one case holding page_table_lock,
in the other case holding pagemap_lru_lock, to hold the page while
doing so)?

Perhaps Matt could add description of what they observed, in support
of the patch.  I'm not yet convinced that it's necessarily the fix.
