Easy.  All applications are themselves swap space - the binary is 
merely memory-mapped onto the executable file.  When the system gets 
low on memory, the only thing it can do is purge some binary pages, 
and then repeatedly page them back in from the original executable 
file.
If you added a little bit of swap, it would be able to page out some 
idle data rather than binaries, and would probably avoid thrashing.
