Subject: NFS mounting a QNX box crashed my Linux one

Hello,
Just for your info, I tried to NFS mount a QNX 4.25/TCP 4.25 box on my RH 6.1
(2.2.12-20) machine, and weird things happened after I have issued the
following commands :
# mount qnx425:/ /mnt
# cd /mnt/tmp
# ls
At that point, the Linux box still responded on a ping, but was giving up on
a telnet (never got to the login: prompt).
My X session was completely dead (mouse + keyboard) , as well as all the
connexions
on that machine.
After the reboot, I checked the log file, but nothing has been logged.
A+,
