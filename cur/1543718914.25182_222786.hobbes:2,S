Dick, it's called capabilities, and people have already modified the 
operating system to do that, it just doesn't work quite as intended in 
some cases. Setuid is the keys to the kingdom, you really don't want to 
use setuid root unless there's no other way.
Remember when everything used to take the BKL? Then people saw a better 
way. Capabilities is the same kind of progression, save the big hammer 
for the big nail.
