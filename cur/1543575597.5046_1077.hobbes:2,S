Hmmmm, if you're messing around with the pci device table, why not just
convert it to use new-style PCI init?  This is fairly easy to do (I did
one driver myself, and that *proves* it's easy).  The main points:
 1) convert the device table to a 'struct pci_device_id' and reference
    this struct with a call to MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(my_struct)
 2) create a 'struct pci_driver' function table, rearranging the driver
    housekeeping functions to fit this table
 3) convert your PCI probe loop inn your init function to use
    pci_module_init(my_pci_driver_struct), which does the looping for
    you
Thanks to Adam Richter's hard work, there are lots of examples of
drivers that have already been converted to this scheme.  I don't
remember if Adam purposely skipped hp100.c or if it was an oversight.
