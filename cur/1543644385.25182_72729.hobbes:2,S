It does (or something else does) - tabs have been space'ified.
What the hell is _wrong_ with mail client authors that they can't get
something as simple as keeping a file intact _correct_? Why do email
clients think they have to corrupt the input on something as simple as
plain 7-bit ascii (oe even 8-bit latin1, for that matter)? Silly buggers.
Please complain to the mozilla people.
