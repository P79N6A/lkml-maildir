<DIV>A brief Introduction<BR>I am a Windoze user, programmer, system 
administrator. compitent in C/C++,<BR>Delphi, Visual Basic and more. I also am a 
little more than a newbe to linux<BR>with several computers running Windows 
version x and Linux mostlly using<BR>Lucent Viking modems.<BR><BR>I have been 
trying to make these work in linux and have been reading all of<BR>the topics 
from several mailing lists with very little help until I found<BR>someone saying 
that this modem was all software driven (duh I knew that) and<BR>that the 
drivers were somekind of seceret (did not know that can't even see<BR>how, sence 
i found them?) and that they were not available. Well as of now i<BR>have the 
technology (drivers source code) to make the drivers required to<BR>run my 
modem. I can recreate the drivers for windozs make new ones for DOS<BR>(also not 
&quot;supported&quot; by the vendor) but i have no ability to program 
in<BR>Linux and don't even know where to start. The drivers would need to do 
3<BR>major things<BR><BR>1. initialize the device maybee at a very early stage 
the ports are turned<BR>off until initialize is complete and successful.<BR>2. 
process every 32bit word before being sent to the modem.<BR>3. process every 
32bit word after being recieved by the modem.<BR><BR>I think this might be 
slightly off topic but am not sure I know that i have<BR>seen this and simalar 
topics on this and a few other mailing lists.&nbsp; sorry<BR>for any 
inconvience.please feel free to respond even if you don't know how<BR>to do this 
as I learn from every comment<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
