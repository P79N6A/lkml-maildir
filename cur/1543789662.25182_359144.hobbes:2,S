Nope.  Periodic mode works (I've made my tests on timer #2), you can just
set only period (through way which sets value according to the spec), and
you cannot set current value (at least I do not know how).  So I can
program VIA hardware to generate periodic interrupt, there is just
unavoidable delay up to 5 minutes. I've worked around by setting period
to 1 tick, so in 5 minutes value and main timer synchronize, and if
timer is not stopped after that then it stays synchronized with main timer.

It would work for VMware's use of /dev/rtc if number of missed interrupts
will be reported on next read.  Otherwise it might be a problem for
keeping time between host and virtual machines in sync.
