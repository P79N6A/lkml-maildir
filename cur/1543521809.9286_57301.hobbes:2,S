It is in the devo kernel, and it works fine in kernels up through 2.3.31 (and
.32?).  The "problem" is that somebody made a patch which broke MD, and said patch
author never offered to fix their handiwork.
Where I work, there's an "if you break it, you fix it" mandate.  (And if you can't
fix it, you come forward and offer those who can some help.)  But that's a minority
opinion on L-K, where the cutting-edge emphasis puts technology several steps ahead
of the stable bug-fixes.  I'm not complaining, mind you; the SCSI mid-level code
cleanups and so forth are much needed, and I'm glad they went in.  But I think the
MD breakage has gone on long enough now that the authors of the new technology
should make a token effort to spruce up the fringes of their efforts.
