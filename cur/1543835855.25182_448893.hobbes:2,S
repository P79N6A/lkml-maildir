Wandering logs is a term specific to reiser4, and I think you are making
a more general remark.
You are missing the implications of the oft-cited statistic that 80% of
files never or rarely move.   You are also missing the implications of
the repacker being able to do larger IOs than occur for a random tiny IO
workload which is impacting a filesystem that is performing allocations
on the fly.

When the repacker is done, we will just for you run one of our
benchmarks the morning after the repacker is run (and reference this
email);-)....  that was what you wanted us to do to address your
concern, yes?;-)
