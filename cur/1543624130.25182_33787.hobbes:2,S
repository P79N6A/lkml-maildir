My pet feature?
cvs dontcommit file.c
What it should do? Mark changes in file.c as private to me, so that it
never tries to commit them to official tree. It would be best if cvs
diff just pretended changes are not there.
So, if I checkout tree, do some dirty hacks to make it compile, do cvs
dontcommit ., cvs diff should show nothing and cvs commit should try
to commit nothing. That would be nice,
									Pavel
