Small windows are (or at least were) pretty common on specialized
hardware with no real full TCP/IP stack.  There was one early HP printer
that had a very stupid TCP stack, and I think it hardcoded its window to
something like a kilobyte or two. 
I wouldn't be surprised if the same was true on some of the embedded
stuff. Think cell-phones that can do POP3. Maybe not today, but never
dismiss the lure of the internet and the stupidity of devices ;)
