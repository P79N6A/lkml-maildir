Let's say an uneven distribution is chosen for all 4 processes, with all processes mapped to processor 0. So they allocate on node 0 yet the scheduler will map these to both processors since CPU should be balanced. In this case, you will have a situation where the second processor will have to fetch memory from the other processor's memory.

So could process 0 run on processor 0, allocating local to processor 0, 
then run on processor 1, allocating local to processor 1, this way 
allocating to both processors?  So over time process 0's allocations 
would be split up between both processors, defeating NUMA.  The homenode 
concept + explicit CPU pinning seems useful in that they allow you to 
take advantage of NUMA better. Without these two things the kernel will 
just allocate on the currently running CPU whatever that may be when in 
fact a preference must be given to a CPU at some point, hopefully early 
on in the life of the process, in order to take advantage of NUMA.
I'm trying to play devil's advocate by the way so bear with me, you've 
been very helpful and I'm learning a great deal from you.  :)
Thanks,
Brett
