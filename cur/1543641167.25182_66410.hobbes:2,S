   Would you consider these for each arch as there are coresponding one for
   IOMIO, and life would be better if we had a standard set for MMIO.
   Please consider the request.
I responded to the private email I got on this subject.
I forget who asked me this, but they said they were working
on this IDE stuff.
My response was that io_barrier() shall be defined on all
platforms in asm/io.h and that you can then define your
ide_read{l,w,b} as:
	__raw_raw{l,w,b}(...);
	io_barrier();
So instead of having a million read* variations, we have one that is
standard usage (little endian + I/O barrier) and then a raw variant
where the cpu does nothing special and you have to byte-twiddle and
barrier explicitly.
