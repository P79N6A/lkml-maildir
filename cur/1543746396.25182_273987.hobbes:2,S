How about this then; let's say that pid_t can be either 16 or 32 bits, and 
for some reason you want to handle something special if the value is 
greater than 0xffffff (or some other arbitrary value between 0xffff and 
0xffffffff), obviously that can only happen in the cases where pid_t is 32 
bit and never when it is only 16 bit, so code like
int foo(pid_t a) {
	if (a > 0xffffff) {
		...
	}
}
will generate warnings when pid_t is only 16 bit, but not when it is 32 
bit, but the code will still do the correct thing in every case and is 
perfectly OK.
