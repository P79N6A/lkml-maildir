	Yeah, I've heard that claimed but a real problem is that nobody can
tell which ones do or don't until you've got a crispy chip.  I've looked
and I haven't been able to find a single reference on any that you might
pick up at Best Buy or Fry's.  I've never seen one that has it written
on it that it has any sort of wear leveling like that.  But I guess we
don't all buy our flash drives at an industrial supply house (forget
Tiger Direct or CDW either - consumer grade).  I would bet that most
people don't even REALIZE that flash has a limited life and wears out.

	Unfortunately, it's the default under some RedHat stuff (yes, I've
filed the bug reports) and the documentation on "mount" is incorrect and
it's arguable if it's any value, and there's no warning of the risks.
"User error" is a bit off the mark when the user has to take action he
has no knowledge of to work around a destructive default he doesn't even
know exists (here I'm referring specifically to the need to unmount the
automounted flash and then remount it somewhere else without the unsafe
options).
	User error also boils down to removing drives before they are unmounted
or sync'ed.  Windows seems to deal with this problem without jacking off
on the FAT tables.  Why is it that Linux has a procedure that is
potentially destructive and degrades performance so badly when MS gets
away without it in Windows?  It's an MS file system.  One of the
contributors on the Fedora list remarked that this explained why his USB
keys were so slow on Linux compared to Windows.

	Already filed bug reports with RedHat.  On both HAL and on the
documentation for mount.

	Oh?  It's of some use now?  Beyond degrading performance to the point
that it takes many times longer to write a flash system in Linux than in
Windows?  Yes, I know, don't use it.  What's it there for, then?  To
protect idiots from removing drives before they're unmounted?  Those are
the same idiots who will not know what happened when it burns up there
drive and they are the least likely to use that option overtly.  Most
people don't realize that it was being used without their knowledge
(much less the risks associated with using it in the first place) and
just thought it was a Linux problem that it took many times longer to
write USB keys in Linux than in Windows.

	Rule number one should be "do no harm".  Maybe it should be under some
"force" flag or something just warning people not to use it unless they
really REALLY know what their doing.  I, personally, would never have
used it under any circumstances.  I was shocked to discover that RedHat
was doing this by default.  A warning to THEM would have been better
than a warning to me, since I already knew not to do stupid shit like
that.  Not sure who is responsible for that HAL package or what other
distros may also be vulnerable to this.  I mostly blame RedHat for this
problem first plus the mount man pages (which I suspect they replied on)
second but I question if there shouldn't be a better way to avoid
destroying hardware here.
