64.  Well, at least CONFIG_X86_L1_CACHE_BYTES has this value.  Last few lines in 
/proc/slabinfo in reverse order are:
kmem_cache
size-64
size-128
size-32
size-32(DMA)
size-64(DMA)
size-128(DMA)
so 64 (INDEX_AC) & 128 (INDEX_L3) slabs were created first.  But 
__find_general_cachep BUGs on *first* entry, which is 32 byte one on systems 
with 4KB pages.
It seems to me that problem is CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB together with 
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK and/or CONFIG_PREEMPT - in your configuration spinlock_t 
has 4 bytes, and whole arraycache_init 32 bytes - so it fits into size-32 slab, 
and you do not hit BUG that size-32 slab does not exist.
On SMP systems with CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK or CONFIG_PREEMPT spinlock_t is 8 
bytes, and so arraycache_init has 36 bytes, and it no longer fits into 
size-32...  And if you'll enable both SPINLOCK debugging and PREEMPT, you get 12 
bytes spinlock_t and 40 byte arraycache_init...
So I believe that if you'll rebuild your kernel with PREEMPT or DEBUG_SPINLOCK 
(or both), you'll get crash I'm seeing.  Probably size-32 slab needs to be 
special cased same way INDEX_AC and INDEX_L3 arrays are.
