Right, but what happens if you need to extend the format? For example 
somebody adds support for USB 2.0 to the kernel and you need to some new 
values. Then you would have the choice between changing the format and 
breaking applications or keeping the format and dont provide the additional 
information. 
With XML (or single-value-per-file) it is easy to tell application to ignore 
unknown tags (or files). When you just list values you will be damned sooner 
or later, unless you make up additional rules that say how apps should handle 
these cases. And then your approach is no longer simple, but possibly even 
more complicated
