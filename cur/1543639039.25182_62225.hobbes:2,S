Correct, and if you look at the code you will notice the #ifdef NTFS_RW 
around it... The read-only compiled driver doesn't have any write related 
code. Only the read-write compiled driver has, but at the moment this is 
just adding necesary safety bits before starting to add actual write code. 
Writing is under development and you will be seing more and more bits 
related to it appearing. (-:
