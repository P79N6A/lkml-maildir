hen I boot Linux 2.2.1 with my ISA ne2000 clone, I get the following in
my dmesg:
---
NE*000 ethercard probe at 0x300: 00 40 05 2e f0 65
eth0: NE2000 found at 0x300, using IRQ 10.
Hw. address read/write mismap 0
---
Then, If I try to ping my networked box, I get the following errors:
---
Feb  7 18:52:27 odyssey kernel: Hw. address read/write mismap 0
Feb  7 18:52:27 odyssey kernel: eth0: trigger_send() called with the
transmitter busy.
Feb  7 18:53:02 odyssey kernel: eth0: Tx timed out, cable problem?
TSR=0x0, ISR=0x0, t=3500.
---
There is *NO* CABLE PROBLEM!
Tried BUT FAILED Solutions:
--------------------
1) Tried swapping in another ne2000 brand.
2) Tried using the 2.0.36 8390.c in /usr/src/linux/drivers/net. (didn't
compile)
3) Tried compiling ne2000 support in as a module
--------------------
In 2.0.36,  I have no problems with this NIC card. It works beautifully
in 2.0.x. Are there any ideas out there? Linus, Alan? Help me out here!
I have
inquired much about this problem, and no one has seemed
to come up with a solution. (Yes, My kernel config is fine. I have
ne2000 support, etc., yada yada yada. )
