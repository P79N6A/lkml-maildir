nice! I've merged your patch and it built/booted fine so it should show 
up in -v15. This should also play well with Andi's sched_clock() 
enhancements in -mm, slated for .23.
btw., i think some more consolidation could be done in this area. We've 
now got the traditional /proc/PID/stat metrics, schedstats, taskstats 
and delay accounting and with CFS we've got /proc/sched_debug and 
/proc/PID/sched. There's a fair amount of overlap.
btw., CFS does this change to fs/proc/array.c:

if you have some spare capacity to improve this code, it could be 
further enhanced by not setting 'stime' to zero, but using the existing 
jiffies based utime/stime statistics as a _ratio_ to split up the 
precise p->sum_exec_runtime. That way we dont have to add precise 
accounting to syscall entry/exit points (that would be quite expensive), 
but still the sum of utime+stime would be very precise. (and that's what 
matters most anyway)
