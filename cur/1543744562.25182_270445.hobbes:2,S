but the overhead isn't the syscall :)  it's the pm timer itself... the 
program below reads the pm timer the same way the kernel does and you can 
see it takes 2.5us to read it...
# cc -O2 -g -Wall readport.c -o readport
# grep PM-Timer /var/log/dmesg
ACPI: PM-Timer IO Port: 0xd808
# time ./readport 0xd808 1000000
./readport 0xd808 1000000  2.54s user 0.00s system 100% cpu 2.526 total
the gettimeofday overhead is dominated by this i/o...
