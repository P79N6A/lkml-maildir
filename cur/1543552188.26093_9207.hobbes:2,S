to me, that says: we haven't succeeded in flushing anything,
and our balance looks OK, so unplug the disks and sleep.  this logic
must have got accidentally inverted at some point.
I think we want to unplug if we've flushed and are low on memory:
	if (flushed && balance_dirty_state(NODEV) >= 0)

definitely.  actually, I think there's some major code rot in the tuning
logic of the VM.  specifically, free_shortage() and inactive_shortage()
both return an int that tells you how many pages we're short.  negative
returns mean we're not short.  but all calls to these functions treat the
return as a boolean!  so for example, the following is wrong:
	if (can_get_io_locks && !launder_loop && free_shortage()) {
(vmscan.c:page_launder)  should be "free_shortage > 0".  there are 
about a dozen other similar places, for which I'll shortly post a patch.
