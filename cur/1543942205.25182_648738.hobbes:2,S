"draw the line" -- I see.
BTW, what is wrong with "exporting the interface"?
What is wrong if both implementations are in the kernel
and then let the users and distros decide which one
they like best and use more?  It'll not be the fist time
this has happened in the kernel.  Both are actively
maintained.
It seems highly arbitrary to say: "X is in the kernel, Y
is not. If you want Y, just forget about it and fix X."
Give people choice at config time.
This is off topic anyway.

Yes, I've mentioned this thing before on this list.  Oh, maybe 3
years ago.  This is why I had wanted for transport protocols
to export ... (oh, let's not get this off topic).

It isn't quite the same thing.  It's like comparing

I thought Serial General Purpose Input Output
(SGPIO) was a method to serialize general purpose
IO signals.

That's true.  And this is why I mentioned a couple
of emails ago to simply export a sgpio device node *IF*
this is what is needed.  Of course devices that use SGPIO
abstract it away for their functional purpose, e.g.
enclosures, LED, etc, and provide a more general way to
control it -- highly hardware specific on one side.
Your abstraction currently deals with "SES" devices
and I'd rather leave that to user-space.  Alternatively,
which I presume is what you're thinking, a HW specific
core would be using your "abstraction" to provide
some unified access to raw features, and that "unified
access" isn't defined anywhere, and would likely not
be.  Alternatively that "unified access" is things
like SES and SAF-TE, which is what vendors prefer
to export, or they prefer to drive this directly
via other means.
That is, I fail to see the kernel bloat, for things
that aren't necessary in the kernel.
If you want your abstraction to fly, it first needs
a common usage model to abstract, and the latter is
missing _from the kernel_.
Unless I don't know the details and you've been
asked to implement this for a single vendor's HW solution.

I didn't say you should do that.  I had already
mentioned that vendors export such controls
as either enclosure or processor type devices,
and this is why I told you that that is what
needs to be exported, which incidentally is
a device node of that type.
Without a common usage model already in the kernel
to abstract (e.g. sd for block device, since you brought
that up) your abstraction seems redundant and arbitrary.
Your kernel code already uses READ DIAGNOSTIC, etc,
and I'd rather leave that to user-space.
