I do agree that the pre and rc names gave a strong hint that (-pre) new 
features would be considered or (-rc) it's worth doing more serious 
testing. If Linux doesn't like this any more, perhaps some other way to 
indicate the same thing would be desirable. I admit that the kernel has 
gotten so good that I only try -rc (by whatever name) kernel, I'm not 
waiting for the next big thing. I think that's really good, actually.
