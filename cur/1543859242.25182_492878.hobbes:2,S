You do not really need the 255-63-X PNP mode. Given a hard disk small
enough, VMware may make it a 16-63-X, 16-64-X, or something like
that. Still works as intended.
You see, the kernel mostly gives a damn about CHS, since the moment
the partition table is scanned, it is translated into LBA offsets (
part of that should be seen in /proc/partitions).
