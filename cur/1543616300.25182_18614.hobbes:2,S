SuSE has a ddrescure RPM in their distribution which will do what you
need:
wh@aragorn:~$ /usr/local/frodo/bin/dd_rescue
dd_rescue: (fatal): both input and output have to be specified!
dd_rescue Version 0.98, garloff@suse.de, GNU GPL
 ($Id: dd_rescue.c,v 1.22 1999/10/19 23:46:25 garloff Exp $)
dd_rescue copies data from one file (or block device) to another
USAGE: dd_rescue [options] infile outfile
Options: -s ipos    start position in  input file (default=0),
         -S opos    start position in output file (def=ipos);
         -b softbs  block size for copy operation (def=16384),
         -B hardbs  fallback block size in case of errs (def=512);
         -e maxerr  exit after maxerr errors (def=0=infinite);
         -m maxxfer maximum amount of data to be transfered (def=0=inf);
         -l logfile name of a file to log errors and summary to
(def="");
         -r         reverse direction copy (def=forward);
         -t         truncate output file (def=no);
         -w         abort on Write errors (def=no);
         -a         spArse file writing (def=no),
         -A         Always write blocks, zeroed if err (def=no);
         -i         interactive: ask before overwriting data (def=no);
         -f         force: skip some sanity checks (def=no);
         -q         quiet operation,
         -v         verbose operation;
         -V         display version and exit;
         -h         display this help and exit.
Note: Sizes may be given in units b(=512), k(=1024) or M(=1024*1024)
bytes
This program is useful to rescue data in case of I/O errors, because
 it does not necessarily aborts or truncates the output.
