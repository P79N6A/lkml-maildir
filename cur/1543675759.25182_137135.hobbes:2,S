Subject: [PATCH] 2.5.70-mm3: 64bit kdev_t architecture updates

Since only i386's __kernel_dev_t is updated for a 64bit kdev_t, this patch
updates the rest of the archs.  Again, it includes asm/types.h to handle
the dirty work of deciding what type each arch needs for u64.  I'm testing
this out w/ an ultrasparc1 box; so far, no major (compile) issues.
