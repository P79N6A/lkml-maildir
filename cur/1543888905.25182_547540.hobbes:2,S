The size isn't the advantage being cited; I'd actually expect the net
result to be larger. It's the control over the layout of the metadata
for cache locality and even things like having enough flags, folding
buffer_head -like affairs into the per-page metadata for filesystems
and so reaping cache locality benefits even there (assuming it works
out in other respects), and so on.
Passing pages between subsystems doesn't seem very significant to me.
There isn't going to be much locality of reference, or even any
guarantee that the subsystem gets fed a cache hot page structure. The
subsystem being passed the page will have its own cache hot accounting
structures to stick the information about the memory into.

I'm not entirely sure what you're on about there, but it sounds
interesting.
