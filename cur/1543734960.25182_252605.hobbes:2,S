I really think this is wrong.
Maybe not from a conceptual standpoint, but that implementation with the
scheduler doing "reaquire_kernel_lock()" and doing a down() there is just
wrong, wrong, wrong.
If we're going to do a down() and block immediately after being scheduled,
I don't think we should have been picked in the first place.
Yeah, yeah, you have all that magic to not recurse by setting lock-depth 
negative before doing the down(), but it still feels fundamentally wrong 
to me. There's also the question whether this actually _helps_ anything, 
since it may well just replace the spinning with lots of new scheduler 
activity. 
And you make schedule() a lot more expensive for kernel lock holders by 
copying the CPU map. You may have tested it on a machine where the CPU map 
is just a single word, but what about the big machines?
Spinlocks really _are_ cheaper. Wouldn't it be nice to just continue 
removing kernel lock users and keeping a very _simple_ kernel lock for 
legacy issues? 
In other words, I'd _really_ like to see some serious numbers for this.
