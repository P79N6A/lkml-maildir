has anyone running RedHat7(with kernel 2.2.16, gcc 2.96, kgcc 2.91.66)
complied 2.2.17 kernel successfully?
i've downloaded the source and gunzip/untar to /root/linux-2.2.17
1. make menuconfig (ok)
2. make dep (ok)
3. make zImage
===> lots of warning message
===> error: checksum.S:231 badly punctuated parameter list in #define
===> error: checksum.S:237 badly punctuated parameter list in #define
4. make CC=kgcc zImage
===> snapshot of errors reported:

....many more errors

5. changed CC= kgcc in Makefile and execute "make zImage"
===> same error as 3 (strange, seems like the the compilation is still by
gcc and not kgcc despite the change)
i was able to compile 2.4.0-test10 kernel image with "make CC=kgcc bzImage"
pls kindly advise on the possible solutions.
thanks.
