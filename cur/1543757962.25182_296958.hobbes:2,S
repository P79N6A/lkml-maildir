This particular kernel function is implemented via a kernel thread per CPU,
with each thread bound to each CPU.  The xterm-does-exit cleanup code is
waiting for the thread which is bound to the busy CPU to do something.
No other CPU can, or is allowed, to do that thread's work.  If it were to
do so, the implicit locking which we get from the per-cpuness would be
violated.
I don't know if any clients of the workqueue code rely upon the
pinned-to-cpu feature.
