That wouldn't seem right to me:
* in the UP-case, it is explicitly called in mem_init() [mm/init.c]:
void __init mem_init(void)
{
[...]
#ifndef CONFIG_SMP
        zap_low_mappings();
#endif
}
* in the SMP-case, this call is delayed until 
  smp_cpus_done() [kernel/smpboot.c]
These two cases are fine however, as the UP-case defines it in mm/init.c,
and the SMP-case has CONFIG_SMP enabled and includes <smp.h>; the warning
comes from this function being called from acpi_restore_state_mem()
[kernel/acpi/sleep.c]) in the UP-case, in which case it isn't declared in
<smp.h>.
Bye,
Jasper
