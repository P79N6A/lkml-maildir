Guilt (Git Quilt) is a series of bash scripts which add a Mercurial
queues-like [1] functionality and interface to git.  The one distinguishing
feature from other quilt-like porcelains, is the format of the patches
directory. _All_ the information is stored as plain text - a series file and
the patches (one per file). This easily lends itself to versioning the
patches using any number of of SCMs.
