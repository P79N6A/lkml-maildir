I'm going to add my AMD/Nvidia IDE experiences as well as my current nforce2 experience.
Firstly, aside from the forcedeth module vs. nvnet hacked, I have never even known of problems with nforce2 systems.  I have a shuttle mn31/n (micro ATX) and I can use firewire, ide hd running udma5, ide cd running udma2, and the only thing I can do to crash/hang the system is to force unload a module.  It's running apic, lapic, acpi quite happily, no preempt, run every test since around 2.5.75.
noteing that.  I have to run my FSB underclocked by 1 mhz.
my cpu claims to be an xp2400(133/266fsb) but I run it at 132/264.  It was hanging/rebooting due to heat.
my other system (a little off topic here)  is a dual athlon athlon-mp tyan thunder k7 system.  will NOT run with apic and the amd ide driver.
