I don't see which libs you are talking about. The compiler you build your
kernel with is totally independant on the compiler you build your apps with.
A few years ago, some distros even shipped a compiler just for the kernel
(they called the binary "kgcc").
So you just have to build 2 different GCC, one for 2.4, one for 2.6 and
you use them to build your kernels. If you want yet another compiler for
your apps, simply do it, it's not a problem. For instance, look on my
system when I type gcc- <Tab> :
$ gcc-
gcc-2.95    gcc-3.3     gcc-3.4     gcc-4.0     gcc-4.1     
gcc-2.95.3  gcc-3.3.6   gcc-3.4.4   gcc-4.0.2   gcc-4.1.1   
My gcc is a symlink to gcc-2.95, and I use any of those to build kernels
and applications, depending on what I need (optimizations, etc...).

Well, I hope it will help you
