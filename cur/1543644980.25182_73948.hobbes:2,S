hm, OK.  Sorry, I did not realise that you were this closely
interested/involved with slab, so things have been sort of
going on behind your back :(

Well with a, what? 100:1 speed ratio, we'll generally get best results
from optimising for locality/recency of reference.

Definitely worthy of investigation.  Memory sizes are increasing,
and the cached-versus-noncached latencies are increasing.  Both
these say "optimise for cache hits".
Plus we'd lose a ton of ifdefs if we enabled it on UP as well...
