Then add another factor to the equation, randomly pick the next event.
Consider if you would, gather entropy by choosing random bytes from 
checksums from random packets.  All the selection isn't technically 
random but very uncontrolled.  You start by picking a random packet 
(seeded from existing entropy), and take a random byte from the checksum 
of that packet.  Using that byte, add it to the entropy pool and use it 
to help determine the next 'random' packet you'll swipe data from.
An attacker would have to have absolute control over the packets 
arriving at the machine to have a chance.  He still cannot know exactly 
which packets are chosen for entropy gathering being that the next 
packet is chosen randomly from two or more entropy sources.  Neither 
will he know which byte(s) in the checksum are chosen.
In real world situations you should have a plentiful source of 'noise'. 
 The above idea can be improved upon significantly I'm sure.
