That's true for multi-user access where knowing the context for each I/O
request - i.e. the object that holds it provides a crucial hint for
read-ahead and write allocation, where for a dumb device that doesn't
know anything about the filesystem's internals, it's much harder to
associate different blocks with their respective containers, or "streams"
(in case the container is typically accessed in a sequential pattern).

That's awesome!
It be really interesting to benchmark one against the other.
