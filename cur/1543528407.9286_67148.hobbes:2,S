In other words have you ever tried to recover data from a compressed hard drive
that had gone I/O bad? Or after a memory failure?

Why? The smallest disk you can buy today is 9G. An average W$ user will not
notice the difference. 
The feature is mostly oriented towards server admins that have to deal with
11MB one page excell spreadsheets flying around.

Many admins have had their fingers burned by various compression features
before so they had to market the thing under a name that is different from
compression. And claim an innovation of course.

There is non-OT question here and it is how exactly is the crap stored on disk.
For those of us who have to read Win file systems from linux this may be
a question of substantial interest. I do not have a W2K around so I cannot try.
Anybody tried it so far?
