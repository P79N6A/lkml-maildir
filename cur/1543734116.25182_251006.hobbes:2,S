Um, yes, you're right.  The direct calls to ldisc->receive_buf predate
TTY_DONT_FLIP; TTY_DONT_FLIP was added by Bill Hawes (if I remember
correctly) in an attempt to fix various locking problems, but
unfortunately the direct callers weren't fixed.

We needed to close the line discpline in order to prevent a line
discipline (such as ppp) from trying to write to the tty.  Given there
was an invariant that a tty always had a line discpline always, we
reassigned it back to N_TTY.  The right answer is probably to be to
add checks to the line discpline code before they attempt to send data
to the tty.
