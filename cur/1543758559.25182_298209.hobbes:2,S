I'm also trying to mesure the process-creation/destruction performance on following three environment.
Archtechture: i686 / Distribution: Fedora Core 3
* Kernel Preemption is DISABLE
* SMP kernel but UP-machine / Not Hyper Threading
[1] 2.6.11-rc4-mm1 normal
[2] 2.6.11-rc4-mm1 with PAGG based Process Accounting Module
[3] 2.6.11-rc4-mm1 with fork-connector notification (it's enabled)
When 367th-fork() was called after fork-connector notification, kernel was locked up.
(User-Space-Listener has been also run until 366th-fork() notification was received)
Does this number have any sort of means ?
In my second trial, kernel was also locked up after 366th-fork() notification.
Currently, I don't know its causition. Is there a person encounted it?
# I wanted to say "[2] is faster than [3]" when process-grouping is enable, but the plan came off.  :(
Thanks.
