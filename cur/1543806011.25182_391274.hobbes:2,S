Interesting. On 111105, I wrote to Asrock about Linux libata support for 
JM360, and mentioned Jeff Garzik as the developer/maintainer, along with 
his requirements for implementing JM360 libata support, but never got a 
reply from Asrock. I didn't get back to Garzik either; my apologies...
Due to other work, I didn't go on with that mobo, and partly because I 
saw no other products using JM360.
Nvidia hving bought ULi, I wonder what'll happen to ILi and Asrock.
I know that (fabless) Jmicron does chipset design and integration.
939Dual-SATA2 is interesting as an upgrade board due to performance, 
price, working PCIe/AGP and provisions for socket M2 via an adapter.
Whether this will actually work is of cause to be seen...
Now having libata SATA support gets it back into my thoughts.
@Prakash: Did you test with a SATA-2 disk?
