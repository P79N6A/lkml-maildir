you can do more but you'd need to build additional APIs, to allow the
highlevel (possibly userspace too) to give hints to the lowlevel.
This only requires the pid and checking current->mm which is trivial. So
without adding a complex API I think this is the best/only thing you can
do to get close to the minimal possible I/O latency from a process point
of view.

I'm not saying anticipatory scheduling is going to be obsoleted by SFQ,
especially because SFQ has to be an option to use only when absolutely
your only care to get the lowest possible I/O latency from a per-process
point of view (like while playing an mpeg or mp3).
But I still definitely think that if you run an anticipatory scheduling
benchmark w/ and w/o SFQ, the effect w/o SFQ (i.e. right now) is going
to be much more visible than w/ SFQ enabled. The reason is the size of
the queue that w/o SFQ can be as large as several seconds in time and
several dozen mbytes in bytes.
