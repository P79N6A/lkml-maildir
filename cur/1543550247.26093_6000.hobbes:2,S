OK, but I can't leave without pointing out that having gcc 2.96 breaks
compiling gcc 2.95.2. I've got Debian for my main machine and RH7 the other
machine on my desk as well as a couple of other test boxen (have to be
administered by clueless WinNT-type operators, so Debian was out), and RH7
refuses to compile 2.2.17 or 2.4.0-test9-pre7. "Aha!" thinks Daniel, "I'll
just recompile gcc 2.95.2 and all will be well!". No joy; it refuses to
compile. Shame, since RH7 has improved dramatically in terms of supporting
hardware RAID 5 as the root partition from RH6.2 (i.e. from not at all to
working perfectly).
