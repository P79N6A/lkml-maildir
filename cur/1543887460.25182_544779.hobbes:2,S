Hangs at boot here:
	Kernel alive
	Kernel direct mapping tables up to 100000000 @ 8000-d000
(and that's it)
This is a Dell Inspiron E1705 with a Core 2 Duo 2.16GHz
highres-v3 also hung at the same point, but 2.6.21-git2-v2 worked
2.6.22-rc1 boots without problem
Is there any information I can provide to help track down the problem?
Thanks,
Frank
