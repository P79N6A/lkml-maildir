I like the current patch, from a quick look. I'll look more soonish
(monday). I've always liked the concept of being able to mix various
traces into the same stream, since it makes it MUCH easier to see what
on earth is going wrong. What I didn't like in the patches Acme did was
the enable part, I'll need to look into that. Again, from a quick look,
what is the BKL doing in there?!

Can't answer that yet, I'll give it a more thorough look next week.
