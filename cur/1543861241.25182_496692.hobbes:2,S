There is absolutely nothing 'odd' about the '7 wire', it is _the_ standard 
for bi-directional hardware flow control, in common usage for at least 25 
years that I'm aware of.

Humm, src code snooping time I guess, when I get a chance.  Right now its 
a race against time to get us on the air with a fresher transmitter since 
I can no longer get 4-1000 tubes to service our old GE, and the ones in 
it are on their last month.  So I'm outta here in a few minutes to go see 
if I can do a decent job of cutting 3.125" transmission lines on a 12" 
chop saw with a carbide blade.
