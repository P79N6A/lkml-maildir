I don't think you need a runtime detection. All that's needed is
the ability to set the clock divisor to a slightly different value
than the default. It doesn't need some special architecture because
that will prevent setting other things like SMP. And yes, the embedded
AMDs we use here have the SMP spin-locks because it is necessary to
completely test the operating system independently of the target
system. This is done by running my development workstation, a Pentium
with two CPUs with the exact same OS. The modules are, of course,
different, actually mostly missing on the target system because
only Analogic-specific hardware interface modules are used plus
the RAM disk.
I just set my workstation time when I log in in the morning.
In a whole day it's only off by:
Script started on Tue Jan 20 17:25:37 2004
$ nettime time-a.timefreq.bldrdoc.gov
Reference time = Tue Jan 20 17:22:26 2004
       My time = Tue Jan 20 17:25:54 2004
    Difference = 208 seconds
   Time set by   time-a.timefreq.bldrdoc.gov (132.163.4.101)
$ exit
exit
Script done on Tue Jan 20 17:22:36 2004
208 seconds. As long as I don't change it during a compile,
everything is fine.
So, again, please don't change anything that prevents me and
others from using the AMD operating system on an ordinary workstation.
Otherwise, I'll have to make some stupid embedded test software
that exercises the OS on the AMD to get by the FDA requirements
for independent testing of the OS. I would also have to re-certify
our testing procedure.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
