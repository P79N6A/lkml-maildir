  I'm snipping because obviously lots of folks are reading the previous
posts. Since you clearly can see the issue, I will let this thread rest in
hopes that we will have a patch to try and that it will make the whole
problem shrink if not vanish.
  It seems the casual assumption that anyone who has a problem must be
putting both devices on the same cable has been laid to rest, time to wait
for new data and/or patches. I will try again next weekend to test the
same problem using a totally separate (Promise) controller for the CD.
