I dunno about that.  Maybe it is, but it has some gotchas.
Recently when doing a sparsification of code I noticed there are
places which essentially do things like:
    void *foo;
    [...]
    foo += bar * n;
Part of the fix (cleanup) was to change the 'void *foo' to
'gratuitous_typedef_t __user *foo' --- which silently breaks the math
if you don't explicitly check for this.
