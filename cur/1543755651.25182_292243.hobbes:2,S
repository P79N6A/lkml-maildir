So, what's the magic amount of redirection and abstraction that cleanses
the GPLness, hmm?  Who gets to wave the magic wand to say what
interfaces are GPL-to-non-GPL and which aren't?
For example, the IDE drivers use GPL symbols but the VFS does not.  So
anyone can write a proprietary filesystem which eventually gets around
to driving the IDE layer.  That is okay, but this isn't?
If the trend of making everything _GPL continues, I don't see any choice
for binary module vendors but to join together to develop a stable
driver API and build it as a GPL/BSD module.  Do the same API for BSD
systems to prove modules using it are not GPL derived.  Watch Greg foam.
It'd be fun.
