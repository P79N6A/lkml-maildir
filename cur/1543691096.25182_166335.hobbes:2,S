Okay, now I'm able to explain it myself.
It's a timing issue.
After this it works well even with CONFIG_APM is undefined:

There were no changes from 2.4.20 to 2.4.22 (with 2.4.20
everything worked fine), so I guess, other timings changed.
I *guess* the 30msecs was a bit strong for cd-drives in
2.4.20 too (btw. it doesnt matter, if I compile ide-scsi
as module and insmod/rmmod it a few times) but worked.
Somewhere in 2.4.21 things were changed somehow that
modified the timing hardly enough to cross the border.

IMHO some ide-proof should have a look at it to answer
this.
