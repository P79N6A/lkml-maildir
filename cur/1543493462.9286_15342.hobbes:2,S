Are you, by any chance, using the XFree86-3DLabs server (version 3.3.3 or 
so ?).
That server messed poked a value into a clock register (by mistake, it used
"80" instead of "0x80" or so) and slowed the clock of the system down with a 
factor 5.5 too.
But that bug has been fixed for quite some time now.
