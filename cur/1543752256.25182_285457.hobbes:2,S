Yeah, I realize it provides some safety, I just wanted to point out
the fundamental difference.  And one point being made is that it's
the occasional worst case latencies which are the problem.  Dynamic
adjustments could be one culprit for this.
Hmm, I wonder if this could have anything to do with it.  These are
within striking range:
  PID COMMAND          NI PRI
    9 events/1        -10  34
  931 kcryptd/1       -10  33
  930 kcryptd/0       -10  34
    8 events/0        -10  34
  892 ata/1           -10  34
  891 ata/0           -10  34
 3747 udevd           -10  33
   26 kacpid          -10  31
  238 aio/1           -10  34
  237 aio/0           -10  31
  117 kblockd/1       -10  34
  116 kblockd/0       -10  34
   10 khelper         -10  34
thanks,
