Greets,
For assorted reasons I have to use a 2.2 kernel
with devfs for my diskless workstations.
I want to have swap over the network, for the rare
occasions when they need to.  I've found two
solutions so far: nbd and nfs.  Both seem to need
patches to the standard 2.2.16 kernel.
Are there any other solutions (that don't need
kernel patches)?
Which solution performs the best?
TIA,
chippo
