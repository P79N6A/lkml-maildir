The fact that the i2c drivers are not really true "drivers" in the
driver model.  We bind them by hand to the device and then register the
device with the core.  That isn't a nice thing to do...
Also the sysfs representation of the sensor stuff is tied to the i2c
sysfs code very tightly, which isn't good for other types of sensors.
It should be in the class portion of sysfs, and the recent hwmon patches
are moving it in that direction.
