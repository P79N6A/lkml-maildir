I wrote that backward, sorry. Cross-CPU wakeups' frequency depend
heavily on the workload. Probably the only other case I can think of
is io_schedule() but that's not really significant.
I'm not really convinced it's all that worthwhile of an optimization,
essentially for the same reasons as you, but presumably there's a
benchmark result somewhere that says it matters. I've just not seen it.
