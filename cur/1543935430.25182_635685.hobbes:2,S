Journalling is on, but it's no use because the superblock always has
corrupted last-checked time at boot. "File system check forced: 31352
days since last check" or so.

Athlon XP 2500+, SiI 3112 (the obsoleted driver that makes the disk 
appear as the predictable hde, not the random scsi mapping driver). 
As for the rest... I'm on Windows, because I can't be arsed waiting 
for an hour for Linux to boot.
