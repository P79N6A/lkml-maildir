Hi,
I'd like to know if it's planned to put some skeleton files into the kernel
source tree, like block device driver etc. I know some of them can be found,
but we didn't found skeleton for block device driver, and it's hard
to figure out (for newbies at least, like me) to begin writing drivers
for newer kernels with slightly redesigned kernel interface compared to
older kernels. Or is there available skeleton sources somewhere else than
kernel source eg on the net ?
thx, Gabor.
