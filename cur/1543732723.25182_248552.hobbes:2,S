HZ not being HZ is the source of many foul problems.
NTP should be able to correct for the error. For systems
not running NTP, provide a fake NTP to make corrections
based on the expected frequency error.
Based on that, skip or double-up on the ticks to make
them be exactly HZ over long periods of time.

Don't optimize until the patch is in and stable.
The divides can be removed much later. Wait months,
if not forever, before making the code less readable.
The same goes for arch-specific non-syscall hacks.
