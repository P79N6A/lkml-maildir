Can someone tell me when the udev/hal support went into the kernel?
I tried compiling a 2.6.12, but when I booted it, Ubuntu 6.06 couldn't
run udev/hal, so my devices didn't get configured.  I loaded rtl8150
using modprobe, but no ethX device was created, so I couldn't test the
card.  I am attempting to determine how far back in the kernel history
I have to go to have this adapter not crash the system when I remove it.
It didn't crash 2.6.12, but it doesn't count if the driver isn't successfully
associated with the hardware, I suspect.
Thanks,
