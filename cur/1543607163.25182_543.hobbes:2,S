Subject: [PATCH] Fix broken reparenting in forget_original_parent() (resubmit)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/10/22/387

The code in forget_original_parent() that attempts to reparent a task to 
another task in the thread group is broken.  It's not safe to parent to any 
task other than init because of the race condition it introduces (init is 
only safe as long as it never dies, in fact).
The patch to change forget_original_parent() to always use init is below.
