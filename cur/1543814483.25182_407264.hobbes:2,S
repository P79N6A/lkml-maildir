OK.  Would it be correct to say that this is what we should do, then?
      * On 2.6.15 and later kernels, use __GFP_COMP at allocation time,
        and get_page in ->nopage.  This is what we're doing as of this
        morning, and it works.
      * For backports to 2.6.14 and earlier, avoid __GFP_COMP, mark each
        page with SetPageReserved at allocation time, and do nothing
        special in ->nopage.  Do we need to ClearPageReserved before
        freeing?
Thanks,
