I can get the trace again, but basically the system was booting. 
AIC_7XXX was defined in defconfig, but my system doesnt have it. Seems like
the senario was the driver tried to probe, found nothing, and tries
to de-reg resulting in the BUG().
I will try to get the recompile and entire dmesg log in the meantime.
