My idea, which I planned to cast into a patch during this weekend, was
to keep a patch in linux1394-2.6.git's feed to -mm which basically
restores what can now be seen in -mm  (one 1394 menu, two big
subsections in it), while Linus' tree gets the menuconfig form.
On the other hand, there may come a period were Linus' tree gets
something like we have in -mm, i.e. the choice to enable one or the
other or both or none of the two stacks.
So, shall I put Jan's patch aside until there is only one stack left?
Or what about:
	menuconfig FIREWIRE_SUPPORT
		tristate "IEEE 1394 (FireWire) support"
	config FIREWIRE
		tristate "new FireWire stack, alias Juju"
		depends on FIREWIRE_SUPPORT && !(IEEE1394=y)
		default m
	[...]
	config IEEE1394
		tristate "legacy FireWire stack"
		depends on FIREWIRE_SUPPORT && !(FIREWIRE=y)
		default m
	[...]
	comment "You can have both stacks installed but should blacklist
	         the modules of one of them.  Else modules from both
	         stacks will be autoloaded on hotplug events."
		depends on FIREWIRE && IEEE1394
(Untested pseudo code.)  This would add an extra level of yes/no/m
choice for those who want FireWire drivers.  But it lets people who
don't want FireWire skip everything at the superordinate menu.
