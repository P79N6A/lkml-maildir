That looks fine to me, but I wonder if there's a cleaner way, rather 
than sprinkling these initializations in the code.  If __udf_read_inode 
fails, then it calls mark_bad_inode; maybe the code should check for 
that before trying to discard prealloced blocks?  I don't really know 
enough about all the UDF codepaths (by far!) to know for sure what the 
best solution is, here.
I do notice that for example ext2_put_inode() checks for bad_inode 
before calling ext2_discard_prealloc.  And it looks like the udf code 
may have a little ext2 history in it :)

(hm, just realized that my original patch in this thread isn't strictly 
necessary for the reasons I originally proposed; udf_clear_inode checks 
for MS_RDONLY before discarding the prealloc, and my first UDF patch set 
the MS_RDONLY flag on these read-only-marked filesystems... ah well)
