Quick suggestion, instead of sending a flame out to everyone you can
think of, try sending some specific information about the problem you're
having the the appropriate mailing list (ltp-list).  Details will help
us solve your problem, ranting will not.

No, again, details please

Yes

We can verify on the hardware we have available to us.  Obviously we
don't have everything ever made, or even a sample of every architecture
supported by Linux.  Being an open source project we depend on others to
let us know when they are having problems on an architecture that we
don't have.  Are you volunteering?

I'm not sure what "205 patches" you're referring to.  We make monthly
releases, and fixes are made to cvs in the interim.  You can pull from
the cvs tree to get the latest.
