Hello!
I opened an overview about Linux IPSec implementations at
http://linux.schottelius.org/ipsec/
I would like to add recent kernel changes in IPSec to the site.
So it would be very nice if someone could forward
latest IPSec news to nico-ipsec@schottelius.org..do you think this is possible?
Greetings,
Nico
