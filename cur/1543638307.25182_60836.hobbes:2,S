Subject: PROBLEM: "make dep" fails for version 2.4.18-5

Just got the 2.4.18-5 patched from Redhat.  The "make
dep" failes somewhere in the middle of the process. 
The error message indicates
xargs -f .....
The -f is a wrong option for the xargs.  The ver_linux
output is attached.  Any help is greatly appreciated.
Frank
