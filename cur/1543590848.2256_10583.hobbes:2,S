Alrighty.  That eliminates the patch.  I'll rewrite the ixj.c according 
to this.  ixj.c will be a large patch due to the numerous revisions, I 
don't know how well it can be broken up into small pieces.  Do you want 
small pieces still?  The ChangeLog shows all the fixes for the 
revisions.  There have been 68 revisions since the version listed in the 
kernel's tree.
