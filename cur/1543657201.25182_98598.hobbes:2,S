This sounds like a mirror of the problem of finding the IOMMU on parisc (there 
can be more than one).
The way parisc solves this is to look in dev->platform_data and if that's null 
walk up the dev->parent until the IOMMU is found and then cache the IOMMU ops 
in the current dev->platform_data.  Obviously, you can't use platform_data, 
but you could use driver_data for this.  The IOMMU's actually lie on a parisc 
specific bus, so the ability to walk up the device tree without having to know 
the device types was crucial to implementing this.
