No, that only clears hpet_virt_address, and thus makes all subsequent 
"hpet_readl()" and "hpet_writel()" calls oops.
But it doesn't actually *tell* anybody that the HPET is disabled, so if 
you later on do
	if (is_hpet_capable()) {
		time = hpet_readl(..);
		..
you will just Oops!
So as far as I can see, even with your latest patch, if hpet_enable() 
fails (and triggers the "goto out_nohpet" cases), you'll just oops 
immediately when you try to suspend/resume the HPET.
THAT was what I meant - when we clear hpet_virt_address, we should also 
tell all potential subsequent users that the HPET is not there!
