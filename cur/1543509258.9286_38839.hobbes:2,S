Hi,
Why does do_load_elf_binary() fail if the program header table size
(e_phentsize * e_phnum) is greater than 65536 bytes? If it is because in
some old versions kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL) couldn't get more than 64K (although
the earliest I remember could get 120K or so) then it should be removed.
But if there is some other reason, I would like to know.
Regards,
Tigran.
