    One thing seems interesting about the log below.... why does it say
    65530/15/61 ???  Linux thinks the logical geometry is 4982/255/63
    (which is correct) but maybe the drive thinks it is 65531/16/63
Yes, it does. (With jumper.)
[So these error messages come precisely at the end of the
truncated disk. But it seems that you are using CHS,
not LBA addressing:
 hda: dma_intr: error=0x10 { SectorIdNotFound },
   CHS=65530/15/61, sector=48737112
and with CHS and 65531/16/63 it is clear that you cannot
get beyond 66055248 sectors. Why are you using CHS?]
["Linux thinks the logical geometry is 4982/255/63"
Note that this logical geometry is entirely irrelevant.
It is not used for I/O.]
["CurSects=-66060037" - that is a misinterpretation.
This number is FC1000FB, but both shorts were interchanged
and the correct number is 00FBFC10, which is 16514064.
A flaw in hdparm, I suppose.]
