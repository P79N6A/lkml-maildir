Not to start an architecture war or anything like that, but I've had uni
and smp alpha linux boxes stay up under moderate to heavy loads for
nearly twice as long as any x86 box.   All of them, both alpha and x86,
are running the same distro and are performing similar tasks of routers,
firewalls, mail, and web servers.  The longest uptime being a 2cpu alpha
with well over 300 days only to be rebooted due to my own fiddling :) 
Other than that all my alpha linux systems, of which I have several,
have been rock solid and overall more reliable than any of my x86
boxes.  I suppose this is because most alpha hardware is less "generic"
than x86 platforms or in other words a little more consistent.  Once you
get a configuration that works it just keeps on going till you hit the
power button.
Just my 2 cents
