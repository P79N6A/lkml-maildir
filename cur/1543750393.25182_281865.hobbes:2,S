Right, all packets, regardless of type, colour, flavour, whatever are enqueued
onto the same skb queue. You can always put a cbq/htb qdisc underneath
and have gred be the leaf qdisc so you can do the prioritizing before gred.
Be warned, heavy dropping in a gred leaf qdisc corrupts any rate estimations
in prio qdiscs.

Yes, struct gred_sched_data.
