Subject: ANNOUNCE: dgipip - dynamic IPIP gateway client/server for Linux

Hello all,
As a result of some discussion on the convers network about the plight
of people wanting to operate IPIP encapsulating gateways, but having
only a dynamic assigned IP network connection, and of hearing that the
DOS based MFNOS had provided a solution to this problem, I've implemented
a compatible scheme for Linux.
The client works, of that I'm sure, and as that is what most people will
want to use, I've released the package for use/testing.
The server *might* work for 2.0.* machines. I didn't have a 2.0.* kernel
handy to test it with so I don't know. It doesn't appear to work for kernel
2.2.* (the means of creating IPIP encap routes changed as many of you will be
aware).
In any case, it's version 0.1 so I won't be offended if you report bugs :)
Debian users can find the software pre-packaged in the potato distribution at
your nearest Debian mirror site. It will work quite happily with slink too,
so just grab it from there if you run either.
It's simple enough that it will probably alien-convert to rpm ok if you want
to try it that way.
Everybody else can find the source tar file at:
	
ftp://tao.linux.org.au/pub/radio/dgipip/
	
ftp://guglielmo.vk2ktj.ampr.org/pub/radio/dgipip/
It will compile against glibc2.x, it might work with older libc with a little
tweaking.
It's fairly ugly, it was a rushed job (I still don't have enough time!) but
you can improve it if you want. It's covered by the GPL of course.
regards
Terry
