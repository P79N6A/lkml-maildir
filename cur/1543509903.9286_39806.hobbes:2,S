`.text.lock' is simply the name of a section, like `.text' or `.data' or
`.gnu.warning'.  It is not a subsection: ELF doesn't have subsections.
It's conventional to use dots to separate words like that as it is
suggestive of some kind of hierarchy.  And GNU linker scripts allow
wildcards so that you can say "link all sections name `.text.*' into
`.text'", if you want.
`.previous' means switch back to the previous section.  So you can write
code like in Linux.  It wasn't documented when Linus started using it,
and it still isn't.  I'm surprised.  Anyone is welcome to send a
documentation patch to <bug-gnu-utils@gnu.org>.
have a nice day,
