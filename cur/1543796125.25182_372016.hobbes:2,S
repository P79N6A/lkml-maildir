ABI or API ? yuck. I am thinking more like a /proc/cachedetail like
thing (mostly for debug).

You are right. I think, kernel should NOT try to distinguish more than
that. This would at least separate out most of the stuff anyway (with
few execeptions).

Yes. I am worried about that too. We do have "mapping->nrpages"  to
represent how many of them are in cache. But getting to all mappings
(especially the ones we can't get to from any process - closed files)
and printing them is quite expensive and need to hold locks :(
