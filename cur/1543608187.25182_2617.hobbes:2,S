Subject: Bind to protocol with AF_PACKET doesn't work for outgoing packets

Hello.
I'm trying to see outgoing network packets through the AF_PACKET
interface. This works as long as I bind the packet socket with
sll_protocol==htons(ETH_P_ALL).  I would expect that I can filter
on IP packets by binding to sll_protocol==htons(ETH_P_IP), but when
I try it I suddenly see only the incoming packets and no outgoing at all.
I suspect this is because dev_queue_xmit_nit() only walks the ptype_all
chain (with the ETH_P_ALL taps) and doesn't process the ptype_base[]
lists. net_rx_action() processes ptype_all as well as ptype_base, so
it works fine for incoming packets.
So... Shouldn't dev_queue_xmit_nit() also process ptype_base then ?
Or is this just complete cluelessness on my part ?
(I'm rather new to this so I don't know how it's supposed to work)
I tried this with linux-2.4.12, but it seems relevant to 2.2.x
and 2.0.x as well.
Thanks,
