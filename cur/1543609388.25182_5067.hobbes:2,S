What information or documentation is there on HFS and writing linux applications what use resource forks and other mac quirkiness.
In particular how do I write an application that uses all the data availiable on macs (and hence HFS) but not commonly used.  Whats more if there is a method to access that data, what happens if I try using it on a non HFS file system.
I'm entertaining thoughts on tidying up some of the underlying code in netatalk if you're wondering why I'm asking all this.
