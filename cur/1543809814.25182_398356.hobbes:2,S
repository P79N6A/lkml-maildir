This may be true if you create your own /dev entries, or are a udev guru 
and can get it to generate the right entries. And if you use ATAPI 
devices it works fine... But with Fedora and SuSE it appears that USB 
devices which appear as SCSI aren't functional. I tested the Fedora 
myself, and after killing udevd and making some entries by hand it 
worked once.
Now if you can access SCSI burners more power to you, with FC4 up to 
recent updates, my one convenient real SCSI device most definitely 
doesn't work, and I havd to fall the system back to Slackware and 2.4 
which was on it before.
Because you know how to get around the problems doesn't really suggest 
that there aren't any.
