pivoting - probably true, moving... why not?

Er...  These mounts might not be propagated, but what about a bind
over another instance of such file in master tree?

Then you are going to have interesting time with locking in final mntput().
BTW, what about having several links to the same file?  You have i_mutex
on the inode, so serialization of those is not a problem, but...

Releasing the last reference will lead to cascade of umounts in that
case...  IOW, need to be careful with locking.
