1. Keep the kernel image on non-writable media as well.
2. If the kernel is compromised, then kernel-level protection doesn't help
   you either (the above was a reference to the claim that user-level daemons
   couldn't be trusted).  You're screwed unless your defense is implemented
   in hardware (which is basically equivalent to putting the kernel and
   security daemons on non-writable media).
