Actually I imagined that if kobject_add() failed it would back out all 
the changes it made -- which means it would deallocate the name 
string.  But requiring people to call kobject_put() will do this just 
as well.

To be symmetrical with kobject_init() and kobject_add().  Besides, 
isn't there kobject_unregister()?  Presumably it will go away along 
with kobject_register(), though.

Sorry, yes, that's what I meant.  After a successful call to 
kobject_add() you must call kobject_del() to undo the _add, and then
kobject_put() for the final cleanup.
