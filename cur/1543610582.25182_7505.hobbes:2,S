Definitely.  Right now the page cache on x86 has a limit (per file) of
2^32 * PAGE_SIZE == 2^32 * 2^12 = 2^44 = 16TB.  And I doubt that will
change.  x86 will be going 64bit in the next 2-3 years, at which point
I don't see it paying to push 32bit code into the larger data sizes.
Especially when we our limit is still 2 orders of magnitude larger
then the largest disk manufactured today.
Now the file size limit on x86 can be increased a little by increasing
the internal PAGE_SIZE for the page cache but that will only give us a
bit or two which really isn't significant.
