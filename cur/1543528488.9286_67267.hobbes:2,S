We do that now. Problem is that we don't keep track of pages
that aren't allocated yet for other users. Or COW pages, or
kernel pages, or ...
I guess we could build a system which does keep track of
everything, but I don't think many people will want to use
it. Imagine needing 3 MB of swap for every apache child
being forked ... (ditto for mysql, sendmail, ...)
