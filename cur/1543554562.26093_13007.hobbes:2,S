Eeek. Apparently I was a bit too early with the champagne... I was
away for an hour or so and when I came back it (2.2.18pre21) had 
oopsed with multiple oops (i.e. the first offscreen) and hardlocked.
I'm now running 2.2.14-5 again, doing the exact same stuff and it
seems to hold up... (knock wood).
Barring someine suggestin a better solution I'll try to compile 
a kernel with serial console and capture an oops that way.
