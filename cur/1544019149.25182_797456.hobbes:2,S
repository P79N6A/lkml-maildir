I agree, we are no worse than we were before.
But I can't understand why we can't be better ;)
If we add the special workqueue for work_on_cpu() (patch 2/3), then why
do we need [PATCH 1/3] ?
IOW, given that the 2nd patch adds the special wq, which locking problems
solves the 1st patch?
Perhaps I missed something, and the patches are questionable anyway,
but I think these 2 patches are "conflicting".
If we use a special wq, then work_on_cpu()->get_online_cpus() is fine,
it can't deadlock with cpu_hotplug_begin().
No?
Oleg.
