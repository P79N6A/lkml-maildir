Subject: VIA IDE bug with WD drive?

Hi all,
I get the following error if I try to enable DMA on my Abit KT7 motherboard
with a VIA2C686 chipset:
hdb: irq timeout: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hdb: timeout waiting for DMA
hda: DMA disabled
hdb: DMA disabled
ide0: reset: success
hdb is a Western Digital 136BA 13,6 GB drive and hda is a Maxtor 20GB drive.
I do not get the error when enabling DMA on the Maxtor drive (hda).
I have tried kernel versions 2.2.16-3 (stock RH7), 2.2.17 and 2.4.0-testx.
Is this a known bug? Is it solved by the IDE backport patch?
TIA,
Rahul
