Nope, it's a stock kernel and it's running on a server, kprobes isn't in use.
And no, to my knowledge there's not been another "unexplained" oops. I've had 
crashes, but they've always been known issues or BIOS trouble.
The machine was recently tampered with to install additional HDDs, but the 
memory was memtest'ed when it was installed and passed several times without 
issue. I'm rather puzzled.
