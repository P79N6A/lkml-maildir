   Netfilter 0.1.13 doesn't seem to compile with 2.3.41-pre3, this
   dirty hack seems to fix that:
   --- linux/include/linux/tcp.h	Thu Jan 27 16:08:13 2000
   +++ linux-new/include/linux/tcp.h	Thu Jan 27 13:36:09 2000
 ...
This is not correct (I know, you said it was a dirty hack).
Because res2 now refers to a single bit whereas res2 was
two bits together in the original version.
So applications depending upon the old res2 should just be fixed.
Most of them are just zero'ing the bits, so are easy to fix.
Netfilter should especially be fixed as it depends upon kernel
internals and is fresh experimental code still.  So it should have
no problem just being updated.
Rusty can you take care of this if you haven't already?
Thanks.
Later,
