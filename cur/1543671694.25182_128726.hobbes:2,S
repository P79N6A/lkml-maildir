Well, i had similar problems with 2.5 stalling, but now that i disabled
preemtible kernel, it is better now. Are there no complaints about preemt?
Also there is one issue, i am not sure if this may be a kernel issue,
but with setiathome running in a X desktop environment all apps work fine,
but when i run openoffice, openoffice responds with 5 second delay.
I remember somebody noticing a problem with evolution that was related to
a kernel problem. Maybe i could help sorting it out?
Regards,
Maciej
