I think Jeff is right on this particular point -- better to have this
worked around in the userspace tool than in the kernel.

Nobody's talking about changing the raw pci data.  What we're talking
about is changing the value read out of
$ cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:00\:00.0/class 
0x060000
We do tweak at least some of the other similar values (vendor, for sure)
to work around bugs; not sure we have an example for changing the class
value yet.
pciutils knows that the kernel has potentially fixed up the values in
the individual files, and to trust those over the raw data.
