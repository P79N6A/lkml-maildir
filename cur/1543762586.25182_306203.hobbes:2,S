Consider what an RNG does:  spews garbage.
In practical applications, you -do not- want to dedicate the machine to 
spewing garbage.  The vast majority of users would prefer to use their
machines for real stuff.  Thus, "extreme RNG consumption" is largely
irrelevant to sane usage.
That said, I cannot remember if the udelay() is hardcoding a policy
decision (bad), or required for the hardware.
In any case, it is the wrong solution to simply "turn on the tap" and
let the RNG spew data.  There needs to be a limiting factor... typically
rngd should figure out when /dev/random needs more entropy, or simply
delay a little bit between entropy collection/stuffing runs.
