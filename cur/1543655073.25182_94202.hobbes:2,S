I hadn't seen it before.  I'll grab it and give it
a look.  I'm assuming it uses ioctl() calls to do
its dirty work.  In that case, it should mostly
still work.  I might have broken something around
the edges.  I also observed some races in the driver
between its ioctl() functions and some timer-driven
health monitoring functions that concerned me.
I'll look those over again more carefully.
Give me a day or so, and I'll let you know how
things look.
I've heard of something Mylex provides called
"global array manager" that runs on Linux.  But, I
think it requires a graphical front end on a windows
box.  I don't think it's open source either.
I'll look it over as a second priority after
this one.
