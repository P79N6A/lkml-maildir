Subject: 2.6.21-rc4-git6 Console freezes

1. Hardware: HP Pavilion DV6150eu, AMD Turion 64 X2 TL-52, NVidia MCP51 
chipset, GeForce Go 7200
2. Problem: 
Console 'freezes' in random moments, showing no underscore cursor, nor GPM 
mouse cursor, it's not responding on network too. System works perfectly fine 
in graphics mode (with propertiary NVidia module loaded, those freezes are 
happening with and without it, so it's not the problem). Appeared on earlier 
kernels (for sure on 2.6.20-rc6, AFAIR I've tested 2.6.18 too), but it wasn't 
so annoying as it usually got to run KDM before freezing (not always) - on 
2.6.21-rc4-git6 it has freezed in:
[    0.000000] Linux version 2.6.21-rc4-git6 (wpk@hippie) (gcc version 4.2.0 
20070307 (prerelease) (PLD-Linux)) #2 SMP Thu Mar 22 19:09:09 CET 2007

After few tries, it boots up perfectly, passing that moment. 
Mentioned device is 
00:0d.0 IDE interface: nVidia Corporation MCP51 IDE (rev f1)
Though it might not be a problem with the device (as it happened before, in 
different moments, on earlier kernels).
