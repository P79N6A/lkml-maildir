Yes, and probably 2.6.21.y, though the patch will be slightly
different, see below.

And thank-you for pursuing this with me.

---------------------------
Avoid overflow in raid0 calculation with large components.
If a raid0 has a component device larger than 4TB, and is accessed on
a 32bit machines, then as 'chunk' is unsigned lock,
   chunk << chunksize_bits
can overflow (this can be as high as the size of the device in KB).
chunk itself will not overflow (without triggering a BUG).
So change 'chunk' to be 'sector_t, and get rid of the 'BUG' as it becomes
impossible to hit.
