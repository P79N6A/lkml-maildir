The 2.6.8-rc2-mm2 kernel has the staircase scheduler, right?  Well, I am
seeing an odd thing.  At least, I think it is odd.
I'm running Fedora Core 2 and playing music with Rhythmbox.  When I
watch top sorted by priority, I see esd slowly increase its priority
until it reaches 38, then it goes back to 20.  ESD is only using 1-2%
CPU.
This is causing a problem because doing just about anything in X, like
bring up a new window or drag a window causes the sound to just stop.
Why does ESD's priority keep climbing?
Oh yes, this does not happen if I change /proc/sys/fs/interactive to 0. 
When it is 0, X's priority climbs faster than ESDs and does not cause
the problem.
