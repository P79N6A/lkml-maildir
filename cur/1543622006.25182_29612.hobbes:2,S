Even within the constraints of CML1, you can do stuff like "I want
CONFIG_USB_HID, which implies that CONFIG_INPUT is needed"
That simple stuff.  For anything beyond that, like "create me an
ipv6-netlink configuration with adequate support for 3rd party modules"
it's not gonna cut it, nor will any reasonable config system.

It sounds like you want an implementation detail -- undo last [n]
choice[s].
Imagine this case:
make xconfig # select CONFIG_USB_HID, which auto-selects CONFIG_INPUT
{ time passes }
make xconfig # de-select CONFIG_USB_HID
On the second 'make xconfig', should CONFIG_INPUT be automatically
de-selected?  No.  Because that is making the assumption that the person
does not want to continue to make the input API available.
