Except that a similar problem with capi existed allready with gcc 3.0 +
kernels 2.4.*, and that problem was reported to gcc people multiple 
times. But it is still broken in gcc 3.0.1:
bp2.c:414: warning: `sbp2_host_info_lock' defined but not used
capi.c: In function `capi_ioctl':
capi.c:1031: Unrecognizable insn:
(insn/i 1675 3103 3100 (parallel[ capi.c:1031: Internal error: Segmentation fault
Please submit a full bug report,
with preprocessed source if appropriate.
See <URL:
http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/bugs.html>
 for instructions.
So, does anyone have any ideas? That problem is critical because
it makes ISDN (capi 2) unusable with kernels 2.4.* + gcc 3.0.* 
All other things seem to function pretty well with 2.4.9 + 3.0.1.
