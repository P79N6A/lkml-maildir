Hi you there!
I do still have a question to the IDE guys. I have fully modularized IDE.
The kernel is 2.3.31. I have the following in modules:
- ide-mod
- ide-probe-mod
- ide-disk
- ide-tape
- ide-cd
- ide-floppy
I have IBM-DJNA-370910 drive on a primary interface. Disk is NOT recognized
automagically (hda: no response ...) so I have to use kernel command line
option "hda=17662,16,63" when booting the kernel with built-in IDE drivers.
Can someone enlighten me how can I do the same when using the a.m. IDE
modules zoo? The "option=hda=17662,16,63" (btw, which module have I to pass
it to?) when used with ide-mod gives the following:
=== Cut ===
[root@nomad block]# insmod ide-mod options="hda=17662,16,63"
./ide-mod.o: too many values for options (max 1)
=== Cut ===  
Any other module do refuse to accept such an option line at all.
What does the right way to load modular IDE looks like? Unfortunately enough
I have not found any light in kernel docs and sources...
Please describe the right procedure to get the drivers loaded and disks
detected.
Building IDE core into the kernel is NOT an option - the whole idea is to
have a possibility to add/remove/change IDE disk[s] without rebooting the
system.
Any help is highly appreciated.
