Here is one more regression report.
My /home was on reiserfs some time ago (migrated to ext3 using convertfs due
to this regression). I read my mail with KMail. I am also subscribed to
several mailing lists. I have a separate Maildir-formatted folder for each
mailing list. Some of such folders are more than a year old and contain
thousands of messages. With linux-2.4, I could click on such folder and the
list of messages sorted by subject will appear in KMail almost instantly.
With linux-2.6, this process takes much longer.
