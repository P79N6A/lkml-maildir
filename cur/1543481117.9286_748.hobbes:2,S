Hi,
on my intellistation the clock is running exactly five times too slow :-(
when i do a cat on /proc/interrupts the timer interrupt
has 100 added in 5 seconds (should it not be 500 ???)
i tried with kernel 2.0.36 an 2.2.0-pre8, both have the same problem.
Does anyone have an idea or knows a workaround?
-- cheers browny
