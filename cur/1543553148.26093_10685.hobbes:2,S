Yes. But that doesn't count like a "show-stopper" for me, simply because
it's one of those small details that are known, and never materialize
under normal load.
Yes, it will have to be fixed before anybody starts doing RAW IO in a
major way. And I bet it will be fixed. But it's not on my list of "I
cannot release a 2.4.0 before this is done" - even if I think it will
actually be fixed for the common case before that anyway.
(Note: I suspect that we may just have to accept the fact that due to NFS
etc issues, RAW IO into a shared mapping might not really supported at
all. I don't think any raw IO user uses it that way anyway, so I think the
big and worrisome case is actually only the swap-out case).

Naah, he mainly just does some browsing with netscape, and (don't tell a
soul) plays QuakeIII with the door locked.
