Subject: [PATCH] Remove inclusion of <linux/irq.h> from pci/quirks.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/10/20/222

<linux/irq.h> states:
/*
 * Please do not include this file in generic code.  There is currently
 * no requirement for any architecture to implement anything held
 * within this file.
 *
 * Thanks. --rmk
 */
The latest update into pci/quirks.c did not follow this and breaks 
building on ARM.
