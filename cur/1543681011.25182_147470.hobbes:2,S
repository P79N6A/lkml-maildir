(Sorry, I missed this)
You can work that out very easily. When your read/write returns a lower
number of bytes, it means that it is time to stop processing this fd. If
events happened meanwhile, you will get them at the next epoll_wait(). If
not, the next time they'll happen. There's no blind spot if you follow
this simple rule, and you do not even have the extra syscall with EAGAIN.
