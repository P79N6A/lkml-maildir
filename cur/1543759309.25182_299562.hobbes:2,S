This is what Seto is proposing, aiui.  I.e. calls around I/O so you can 
gracefully handle errors during that I/O.

The idea is to allow them to do something like that, or consolidate such 
threads in a platform specific error handling thread or interrupt handler 
that can call a driver's ->dma_error(dev) routine (or ->error(dev, ERROR_DMA) 
or whatever) routine.
