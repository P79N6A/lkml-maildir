The option itself doesn't hide the bug this time, I got one freeze
pretty quickly.  But after starting the trace-it-1sec loop, I couldn't
get it any more.
Normally I get a freeze after 3-5 minutes of testing, but with
trace-it-1sec there's still nothing after 30 minutes.
If I stop trace-it, and do "echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/trace_enabled",
I get the freeze again. It's a perfect heisenbug.
This issue came up when I was testing a userspace fuse bug, and now
the reporter of that bug (added to CC) says that he also sometimes
experienced a hard lockup during testing but ignored it up to now.  So
we may yet get some info from him.
It could be something fuse related, but it's very hard to imagine how
fuse could trigger such a low-level problem.
