well but busybox is big nowadays and generally compiled against glibc.
i'm quite eager to kick busybox out of default Debian initramfs-tools
to have an klibc only default initramfs. those tools are needed atm,
and there is not enough yet. afaik suse adds sed on klibc with a minimal
patch and we'd liked to have stat, kill and readlink on klibc-utils.
how about busybox on klibc?
