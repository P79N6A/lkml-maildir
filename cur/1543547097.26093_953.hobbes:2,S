	a) fs methods _are_ called under BKL.
	b) BKL has nothing to single-processor races. Proof: definition of
lock_kernel() on non-SMP builds. You sleep - you lose BKL. schedule()
drops it (and restores when your process gets a timeslice again, but
whatever happens in the meanwhile - happens).

	BKL matters only in the areas where you do not block. Moreover,
fs code is still under the BKL, so it's totally moot.

	Which means pageout when you are dealing with sparse files. You
don't have them - fine, then you can take such lock right now.

Using kiovec, for one thing.

Filesystems, actually. The problem is not a burst of IO (it will not
happen - your thread is locked), but completely unnecessary interlock
between the output on different files.

Let me put it that way:
	It will not help with anything except a very specific problem with
sparse files.
You've mentioned handling of HFS. Guess what, there your suggestion gives
zero. Why? Because pageout on HFS never has a chance to allocate anything,
so no matter what/how you lock on allocation, kswapd doesn't enter the
picture. At all.

No problem with _that_.
How about we all calm down and do something more useful than this pissing
match? One thing that became really obvious is that current documentation
is either not enough or not read. Hell knows what to do about the latter,
but the former can be helped. We have several pieces of it - Richard's one
in the tree, Daniel's postings on fsdevel and several parts written by
various folks. This stuff needs to be merged (and corrected where needed).
I volunteer to do that - I've spent quite a while dealing with the code,
so I at least know what _is_ there. I would be really grateful if
	* folks who have writeups would post URLs to them (or texts
themselves, if they are small enough). Preferably to fsdevel, but private
email will also go.
	* people would comment after the result will be posted. Especially
about the missing / hard-to-understand pieces of text.
	* somebody helped to turn the result into decent English text.
