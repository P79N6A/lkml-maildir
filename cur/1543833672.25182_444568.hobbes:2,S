Here's a possible example:
I have one disk which I want to share between multiple virtualized  
instances for root filesystems.  I bind-mount /onedisk/foo as the foo  
virtual machine's root and /onedisk/bar as the bar virtual machine's  
root.  There should (must) be two interpretations of the linear UID  
space on that disk, one for the foo virtual machine, and one for the  
bar virtual machine.  By allowing the administrator to determine UID  
namespace per-vfsmount, you make such an arrangement possible where  
it otherwise would not be.
With NFS and the proposed superblock-sharing patches (necessary for  
efficiency and other reasons I don't entirely understand), the  
situation is worse:  A mount of server:/foo/bar on / in the bar  
virtual machine may get its superblock merged with a mount of server:/ 
foo/baz on / in the baz virtual machine.  If it's efficient to merge  
those superblocks we should, and once again it's necessary to tie the  
UID namespace to the vfsmount, not the superblock.
