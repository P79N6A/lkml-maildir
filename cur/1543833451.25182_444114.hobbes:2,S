Hey,
x60s gnychis # echo -n mem > /sys/power/state
bash: echo: write error: Operation not permitted
x60s gnychis # cat /sys/power/state
standby mem
I think I have acpid installed, it is a Gentoo system:
[ebuild   R   ] sys-power/acpid-1.0.4-r3  USE="-doc -logrotate" 22 kB
I think I've already set up some acpid stuff for my CPU frequency
scaling capabilities, I followed this guide:
ttp://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/power-management-guide.xml
I modified:
/etc/acpi/actions/pmg_switch_runlevel.sh
If i "tail -f /var/log/acpid" and try to suspend the system or shut the
lid, no new messages come up.  If i pull my power cable to switch
between AC and battery, messages do come up.
Whats my next step here?
Thanks!
George
