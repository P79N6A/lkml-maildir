Hi,
Thanks for finding these bugs! I'll post an updated version soon (2 patches
with no separate Kconfig patches, one LRO and one eHEA patch). See comments below.
Thanks,
Jan-Bernd

I'd tend to stick to an explicit check as implemented in your patch
for now

I thought about it... As we do update the TCP checksum for aggregated
packets we could add a second ip_summed field in the net_lro_mgr struct 
used for aggregated packets to support HW that does not have any checksum helper
functionality. These drivers could set this ip_summed field to CHECKSUM_NONE, 
and thus leave the checksum check to the stack. I'm not sure if these old devices benefit
a lot from LRO. So what do you think?

Hmmm, can't confirm that. For our skb-based version I see
correct checksums for aggregated packets and for the page-based version as well.
I used: (tcpdump -i ethX -s 0 -w dump.bin) in combination with ethereal.
Don't see problems as well with your tcpdump command.
