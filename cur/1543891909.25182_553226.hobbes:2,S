Then I've found that ext3_read_inode() can call make_bad_inode() without any error/warning messages, for example in the following case:

Ah, I see - so you have confirmed that this inode does have bad ops...? 
I did notice on another orphan inode bug investigation that 
ext3_inode_delete won't clear orphan from a bad_inode...

That seems reasonable to me in any case, though as Andrew said, do you 
know for sure how the bad inodes were getting on the orphan list...?
Is it possible that they were recycled after being freed while still on 
the orphan list, as in my previous reply to your previous message?
