Yes, I know. The patch needs to be enhanced/corrected. From what I read
in this thread it seems a fix to that priority inversion (high priority
processes temporarily inherit the low priority of the holder of the
lock) would be good anyway, even for the current scheduler.

I like the idea to temporarily increase the priority of the lock holder
as mentiond in this thread, but I don't know how to do. All I can think
of has bad races and slows things down.

You mean `p->counter + p->priority > current->counter + 3 + current->priority'?

That's basically what I do. I just omitted the + 3 and scaled the
p->priority
The +3 disappeared because I want to help freshly woken-up processes to get
the CPU. This still doesn't work very well and needs further
modification of goodness(). 
I do that scaling to keep p->counter and p->priority in their usual
ranges while having a range of 11 niceness-values getting the CPU.
(10<<2 = 40  and  current->counter = [0..40])
