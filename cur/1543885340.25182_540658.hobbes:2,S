There is no one policy here that will make everyone happy.
Some will want all the data before some was lost,
others the data after some was lost.
The real goal is to minimize any data loss.

The flush minimizes stale data the application must process.
As Alan said in his response there are other sources of
stale data beyond the kernel's control. But we absolutely should
be flushing all buffers we control.
In the end, if more reliability is needed the application must
implement its own discipline of framing (defining block boundaries) and
checking (CRC) on the raw data stream.
