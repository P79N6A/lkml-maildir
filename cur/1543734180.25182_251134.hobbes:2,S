These messages are very common on many platforms, infrequent (once
very few days to twice a day at most in my observations) and seemingly
harmless.
I agree that if you get *many* of these certainly that would indicate
there is a problem but I've not not heard a single instance of this
and if that is the case we need to deal with it differently.

Sometimes as boot, though often in my experience several minutes after
boot.

I think in *both* cases we want to detect a largish (more than 1 ever
n seconds or so) number of these and then complain, not before and
even then not excessively so that we printk our-selves to death.
I'm not inclined to offer such a patch right now as it feels like it's
fixing a problem nobody has reported.
