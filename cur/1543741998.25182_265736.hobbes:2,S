128mb. System was idle, fresh after boot.
Seems I wasn't clear enough. I will try harder now:
Even if I add up size of every process, *counting libc shared pages
once per process* (which will overestimate memory usage), I arrive at
23mb *total memory required by all processes*. How come kernel
found 90mb to swap out? There is NOTHING to swap out except those
23mb!
(Of course when oom_trigger was running, kernel first swapped out
those 23mb and then started swapping out momery taken by oom_trigger
itself, but when oom_trigger was killed, its RAM *and* swapspace
should be deallocated. Thus I expected to see ~20 mb swap usage).
