WIBNI?
Anyway, MSI needs more than the standard size as well.
But I would actually prefer the interface to go the other way:
	pci_save_state(pdev);
		and
	pci_restore_state(pdev);
Allocate and store the state in a pointer in struct pci_dev, or 
somesuch.  And somebody other than the low-level driver figures out the 
amount to save and restore.
