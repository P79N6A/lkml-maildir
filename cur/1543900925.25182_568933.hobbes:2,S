Macros should never evaluate their argument more than once, because if they
do they will misbehave when someone passes them an
expression-with-side-effects:
	struct inode *p = q;
	EXT4_DIR_LINK_MAX(p++);
one expects `p' to have the value q+1 here.  But it might be q+2.
and
	EXT4_DIR_LINK_MAX(some_function());
might cause some_function() to be called twice.
This is one of the many problems which gets fixed when we write code in C
rather than in cpp.
