Hmm I use the same compiler from SUSE10.2 and it works for me (with both
mm and only my tree applied) 
Ok mm fails with some errors in the wireless drivers but with 
wireless disabled it compiles.
When you compile a simple test program like
main() { printf("%lu\n", __builtin_labs(-1)); }
does it work?

Andrew, I actually checked that and the abs() there is just abs()
not a labs(). So it wouldn't work on 64bit platform.
We could opencode it of course, but __builtin_labs should be really 
there.
