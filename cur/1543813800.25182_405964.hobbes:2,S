Subject: Problem applying Patch to linux 2.6 kernel

hello,
I am trying to apply the patch to linux 2.6 kernel on linux fedora core 4.
As per Kernel-HOWTO I should do the following:
i have downloaded the patch "patch-2.6.15.bz2" from www.linuxhq.com site
,kept that patch in /usr/src. 
Changed dir using cd /usr/src and did a
bzip2 -dc patch-2.6.15.bz2 | patch -p0.
 
I followed the instructions mentioned, the following happens:
 
# bzip2 -dc patch-2.6.15 | patch -p0 
can not find file to patch at input line 5 Perhaps you used the wrong -p or
--strip option?
The text leading up to this was:
--------------------------
|diff --git a/Documentation/hwmon/it87 b/Documentation/hwmon/it87 index 
|7f42e44..9555be1 100644
|--- a/Documentation/hwmon/it87
|+++ b/Documentation/hwmon/it87
--------------------------
 
File to patch:
 
What steps I am doing wrong while applying the kernel patch?
Please let me know how can apply the above mentioned patch to mykernel...
and why I am getting the above mentioned error message...
My current kernel version is 2.6.11-1.1369_FC4 and I am trying to apply
2.6.15 kernel patch.
Is it necessary to apply patches such as 2.6.12,2.6.13,2.6.14 in-order
before I will have to apply 2.6.15 kernel patch or should I apply 2.6.15
kernel patch directly without applying intermediate patches?
 
Please suggest me to solve this patching problem.
