ok, let us define a new KEY_KPPOUND in linux/input.h
this also means that any application wanting to use this key must
be updated to read this new keycode.
do you want me to add a new value for KEY_KPPOUND in linux/input.h
and include it in the next patch, or can you add that value to the
tree first?

I agree - I dont want to upgrade the driver code whenever there is a
new phone with different key-mapping.
regarding get/set-keycodes, please let me know how I should
proceed on this one..
