Hi
I have a MSI MS-6701 with an onboard SiS900 network card. Using the 
linux kernel 2.4.23 and 2.6.[0-3] I experienced very low transfer rates 
of 200-300Kb/s. Looking at the boot messages, I found a number of 
entries about unknown PHY tranceivers at several addresses. Only at one 
address a Realtek RTL8201 PHY transceiver was found. By default the last 
transceiver, not the known one, was selected.
All but the recognised transceiver had a fault bit set. So I added two 
lines to take that bit into account. This allowed the known transceiver 
to be selected and resulted in increased transfer rates up to the 
expected 10-11Mb/s.
I don't have access to other SiS900 nics nor appropriate documentation 
to check my modifications. So I'd be glad if people with such cards 
could check or anybody with experience with nic drivers could comment on 
this patch.
