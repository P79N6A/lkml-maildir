The two settings are not really comparable. The "effective timeslice is 
the double of the granularity" thing i mentioned before is really a 
special-case: only true for a really undisturbed 100% CPU-using 
_two-task_ workload, if and only if the workload would not reschedule 
otherwise, but that is clearly not the case here: and if you look at the 
vmstat output provided by Michael you'll see that all 3 schedulers 
rescheduled this workload at around 1000/sec or 1 msec per scheduling 
atom. (But i'd agree that to be on the safe side the context-switch rate 
has to be monitored and if it seems too high on SD, the rr_interval 
should be increased.)

even on a totally idle system there's at least a 10 Hz 'background 
sound' of various activities, so any setting above 100 msecs rarely has 
any effect.
