Hi All!
I'm now designing sound driver for Linux and trying to support Direct Access 
to DMA buffer in it. But I can't find games (besides Quake),  that support 
this. Of course, I can debug this with my own application, but I'd like to 
be sure that my implementation is compatible with standard.
Would you advice me such game. Unfortunately, I could not run Quake on my 
computer (I have no 3dfx video card).
Thanks.
Konstantin Lazarev.
