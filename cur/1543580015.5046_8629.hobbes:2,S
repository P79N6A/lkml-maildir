For outb_p, EAX is used, usually for the last time, in the preceding
"out" instruction so clobbering it is not a big deal.
For inb_p, you first have to copy EAX to another register before
outputting the post_byte.  That's a small penalty.  Are in[bwl]_p used
anywhere time critical?  (Richard Johnson's explanation for outb_p
implies that inb_p is not required, but perhaps that explanation doesn't
tell the whole story).

Can the BIOS-written value be read from port 0x80?
