I have a block driver I inherited that I working on that has a problem and
was wondering for cleaner solutions.
The driver can accept written characters from either userspace programs or from
the kernel.  From userspace it uses sys_write.  That in turn calls block_write.
There's almost 100 lines of duplicated code in a copy of the block_write
code in the driver "block_writek" as well as duplicate code in audit_write vs. audit_writek.
The only difference being down in block_write at the "copy_from_user(p,buf,chars); "
which becomes a "memcpy(p,buf,chars)" in the "block_writek" version.  
I find this duplication of code to be inefficient.  Is there a way to dummy up the
the 'buf' address so that the "copy_from_user" will copy the buffer from kernel space?
My assumption is that it wouldn't "just work" (which may also be an invalid assumption).
Suggestions?  Abuse?
Thanks!
