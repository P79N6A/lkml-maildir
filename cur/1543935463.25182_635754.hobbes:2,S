ok done; I had to fizzle a bit because some things aren't *exactly* a BUG() statement
but I track them anyway (things like the "sleeping in invalid context" check), so I
had to somewhat arbitrarily assign categories for those. I might fine tune these over time
some; if you or someone else sees problems with categorization please let me know
