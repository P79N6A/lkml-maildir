The hardware part of mode restoring could really be done the register way and
may be interesting - i did code a lot in dos and this is what i did too, 
if i had experience with register programming and vga(..). Mostly i skipped
this arena, because i have had information about vga registers just enough
to damage monitor, so rather used VESA for video stuff :)
But i think only this way should break some internal state of console or
what driver. 
Thanks for the willingness, thought. I read from the thread - James Simmons,
console developer, is working on it, so you may eg. ask to cooperate with him,
he surely has a lot of ideas of text/vga switching in linux.
Cheers                                                               B.
