Until I can pass a patch or source file as an argument to a script and get out 
the URL of the git tree it needs to go into on the path to Linus's tree, 
MAINTAINERS is inadequate.  If I ask for the MAINTAINER info of 
drivers/net/atl1/atl1_main.c, I should get back myself, my co-maintainer, our 
sourceforge URL, our mailing list address, etc.  There should also be a 
mechanism, either as part of MAINTAINERS or something else, that will tell me 
that atl1 is part of the netdev subsystem, which is discussed on 
netdev@vger.kernel.org, maintained by Jeff Garzik, and has the appropriate URI 
for the netdev GIT tree.
