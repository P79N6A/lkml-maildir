Short answer: kernel hacking.
You might want to subscribe to linux-mips@oss.sgi.com and visit
irc.openprojects.net #mipslinux, which are more appropriate fora for
this. There is also a site dedicated to Linux on DecStations at
	
http://decstation.unix-ag.org/
which distributes a port of 2.2.x to DecStations. It makes no reference
to DecStation 4000's so you may well be faced with porting it yourself.
Cheers,
Bill
