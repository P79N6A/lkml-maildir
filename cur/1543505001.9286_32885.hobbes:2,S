AFAIK it's a well-kept secret (well, it was :-) that people who are
interested in ISDN4Linux development (but not active developers
themselves) may get a subscription if they ask nicely. I think the
reluctance to make it fully open is the experience with the isdn4linux
mailing list, which has an astounding amount of traffic.
However, perhaps it should be archived somewhere publicly, that may help
in that direction.
