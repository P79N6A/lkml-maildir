My patch does exactly that.
Sam's patch only made a subtle difference for all*config, but otherwise it 
would have made little difference, i.e. you still had to edit .config.
The maybe only remaining issue is which default config to use for 
defconfig, when ARCH isn't specified, but that is purely a Kbuild issue.
