Hi Dick,
You are right, its not a zombie.
The process is held up in "drain" in the tty close of the
processes stdin (/dev/ttyS0).
(I assumed brackets in ps -ef meant zombies, but that's wrong)
I added some code to make a short timeout in the "tty close" part of
the driver, then check the values of:
current->signal->shared_pending.list.next
current->signal->shared_pending.list.prev
They *do* change, when I send the process (date) a signal.
The kernel just isn't waking up the driver's "wait" to let it
know that there are signals pending.
Also, why did this work under 2.4?
This is why I was wondering if this was intentional, or was just an
oversight...
Thanks!
Scott
