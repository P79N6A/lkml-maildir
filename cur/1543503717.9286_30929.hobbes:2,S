If you need service X to be realtime, then you can't rely on a nonrealtime
service. For sure. But Linux services are available to the RTL rt tasks, its
just that the RTL tasks can't magically make Linux services be realtime.

Not unless it relies on the UDP packages coming in at a fixed rate. But 
relying on precise timing of UDP packages seems a little peculiar anyways.

Au contraire. Those systems are closely coupled on Linux because the micro-kernel
experiment showed the consequences of separating them.
Process 1                         Process 2                 Process 3
read data from a RT pipe and	  read from the file        Gnuplot
write to disk on the FS           do computation
                                  output to standard out
The closely coupled OS will correctly note the shared data between
the three processes for a major performance win.
