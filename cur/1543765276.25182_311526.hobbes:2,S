Hi,
I'm surprised nobody considered GNU Arch 
(
http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/
) to replace BitKeeper - it was 
probably started in direct response to the Linux Kernel using a 
non-free tool.
I must say I haven't used it, but from reviews and comparisons I've 
read, it seems to be a good tool.
