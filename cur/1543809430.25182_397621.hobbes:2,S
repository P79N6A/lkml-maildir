If history is a guide, it will.  KDE is harder because the C++ as
implemented in gcc has changed in the meantime, so things that were
correct-ish two years ago aren't anymore and the libraries aren't
binary-compatible with the older gccs, but in the gtk/gnome case I
have programs I wrote in 1999 that still compile and work as is.  And
in the X case, I have programs from before linux existed that still
compile and work as is.  So I'm not sure what your point is here.
