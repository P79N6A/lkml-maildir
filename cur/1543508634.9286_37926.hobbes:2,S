	Exactly my point.  Your comment that "Now that companies are beginning
to run Linux on production systems, the carefree attitude toward "stable"
kernels has to change." is what I was commenting on.  That represents the idea
that because some special group of people are using Linux that we must limit
Linux in some way, such as upgrading very needed parts of the kernel.

	Think of those of us who have to upgrade to a new kernel, then
discover that the patches we have to apply (ie: RAID patches) won't apply
cleanly!  This is NOT good.  I've had to go through a couple of times and
apply the raid patch by hand, and I've been bitten by doing that once or
twice, badly.  It would seem to me that most people who are using RAID
under linux are using the later RAID, because it's that much better.  I
would agree that perhaps it should be put in as a seperate CONFIG option,
and even marked 'experimental' if people are truely concerned, but it needs
to get updated with the regular kernel releases.
