Mr. Engel,
Thanks for the tip.
I like to develop programs. If I have to write a program for something
that I don't know, I do some searchs, I read manuals, I understand
this thing and later I write the program.
Can you suggest something to me? :)
I really want to help, but I don't know where I should start.
I need to see how it works, what I need to have to help. I think that
a C compiler and a knowledge in C isn't sufficient. :)
I don't know if exists a guide that I can read..... if it exists,
please, tell me where I can get it.
