And that's the whole issue.
As soon as the kernel is in Unicode  mode for the console, currently
there is no way to input accented characters through a dead key
(composed).
Some years back when 8-bit encodings where used there was no problem,
however now all distros are broken with regards to this.
I do not know what is the next step to consider adding the patch. Do we
get a kernel maintainer related to console I/O speak up and say "Hmm, I
*might* consider a patch, if I see it and people say they are happy"?
