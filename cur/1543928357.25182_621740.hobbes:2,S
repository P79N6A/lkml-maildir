Hi Neil,
If we implement first solution, we don't have to implement second. Problem
will automatically be solved.
In general adding more code in crash shutdown path is not good. We are
trying to make that code path as small as possible.
OTOH, I think we have not root caused this problem yet. We don't know yet
why interrupts are not coming to non-boot cpu. I think we can go little
deeper to compare the system state in normal boot and kdump boot and see
what has changed. System state would include, LAPIC and IOAPIC entries
etc.
Are we putting the system back in PIC mode or virtual wire mode? I have
not seen systems which support PIC mode. All latest systems seems
to be having virtual wire mode. I think in case of PIC mode, interrupts
can be delivered to cpu0 only. In virt wire mode, one can program IOAPIC
to deliver interrupt to any of the cpus and that's what we have been
relying on  until and unless there is something board specific.
Thanks
Vivek
