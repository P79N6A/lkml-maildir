Your signal handler function is illegally calling non-reentrant functions.
The *printf() family of functions are going to need to call malloc() to
allocate buffers. malloc() cannot be re-entered.
So specifically your deadlock sequence is:
Parent:
fork()
fprintf()
-> malloc()
   -> take a malloc() lock
(Child schedules and sends SIGALRM at this point)
SIGALRM:
fprintf()
-> malloc()
   -> try to take a malloc() lock
      -> deadlock, lock is already taken and will never be released!
Modern glibc / kernel combinations which use futexes in the malloc code
really seem to expose this race.
Cheers
Chris
