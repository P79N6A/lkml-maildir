Hello,
I'm about to compile my new 2.4.27 (Debian Sarge) kernel. There is
only one hurdle left to take.
For my 3C905C-TX-M I wan't to use the latest vendor driver since I
heard the famous 3c59x is not optimal for that card. The driver of
choice is: 
http://support.3com.com/infodeli/tools/nic/linux/3c90x-102.tar.gz.
How do I compile this source (3c90x.c and 3c90x.h) directly into the
kernel (not as a module)? And how as a module inside a
my-kernel_modules.deb like ALSA
get's compiled?
Kind regards,
Jouke
