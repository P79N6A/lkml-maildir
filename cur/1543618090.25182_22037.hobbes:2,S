Reiserfs puts on-disk inode (stat-data) near file "body" which is an
array of pointers to actual blocks of the file. This optimizes the case
of short files, because inode and file "body" can be read in one io. But
when there are many large files in the same directory, this results in
inodes of the files from the same directory being far from each other on
the disk, making readdir() or sequential stat() slower. Reiser4 uses
(will use, that is) different allocation policy that tries to address
this.
