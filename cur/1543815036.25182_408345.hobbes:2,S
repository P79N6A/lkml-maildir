Hi all,
While sata_mv in 2.6.16-rc6-mm2 seems stable (yah!) compared to
2.6.16-rc6 (no crashes, no data corruption), I still get these messages:
[ 3962.139906] ata5: translated ATA stat/err 0xd0/00 to SCSI SK/ASC/ASCQ 0xb/47/00
[ 3962.139959] ata5: status=0xd0 { Busy }

I'm not entirely sure this is only happens on sata_mv (Marvell
MV88SX6081) as out of eight disks only one is connected to the onboard
sata_nv (nVidia) and the error doesn't happen very often. But I'll keep
an eye on it.
Are these messages somehow dangerous or otherwise indicating a
potentional serious problem? A google search came up with a few links,
but none of them helped me understand the messages.
Thanks!
