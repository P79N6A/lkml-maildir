Yes, seems to be up now.  But you do need to submit your module if you
want to make a case that LSM should be retained in mainline.  Even if
LSM stays, it could be altered in the future to help counter misuse of
the interface, and such changes could break your module if you aren't in
the tree.  Not to mention that out-of-tree modules don't fair well in
general.
