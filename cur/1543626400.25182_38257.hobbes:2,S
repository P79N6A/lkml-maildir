Hmm.  Could it have something to do with the 1k blocksize?

The 15% delta was between 2.4.19-pre5 and 2.4.19-pre5aa1.  The move
a tree around test may not be a particularly wonderful test though.
(Bonnie, known to be less than wonderful test, shows no difference)

My disk throughput loss has nothing to do with the VM change I think.
I thought your flush changes would give me more, just as my flush
changes to 2.4.6 did.  Alas, it didn't pan out.
