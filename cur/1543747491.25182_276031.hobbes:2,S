Where do you want to move it ? 
I don't buy that moving the invocation to any place will solve the
problem of multiple invocations.
The multiple invocations happen with SMP and UP + PREEMPT, when the lock
is dropped in out_of_memory()
	spin_unlock(&oom_lock);
	oom_kill();
	spin_lock(&oom_lock);
How does moving the invocation change this ?
