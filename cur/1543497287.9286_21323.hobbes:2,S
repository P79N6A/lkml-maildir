I don't think it is ipv6.  I have two machines w/ eepro100 cards, one onboard.
Every 10-30 seconds, the cards storm the network, totally disabling it for
anywhere between 5 and 30 seconds -unless- the card is in promiscuous mode.  If
the card is left in promisc, it'll function perfectly.
While this storm is going on, the machine originating it appears completely
unaware of the activity.  tcpdump on that machine shows nothing however any other
machine shows the packet flood.  The packet flood is entirely comprised of one
specific packet for that particular flood.  Perhaps it is the last packet being
sent and the transmitter gets wedged?
This has been happening since early 2.2.x.
If anyone wishes tcpdump captures, I'll be happy to provide them.
