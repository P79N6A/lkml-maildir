FIBMAP is used by bootloaders.
It can also be used to optimise file access at the user level --
arguably a dubious thing to do, I'll get back to you when I've done the
experiments.  (Ordering inode access by number when you've a lot of
inodes to read is sometimes a big win, but I don't know if ordering
content reads through FIBMAP is a win yet).
Please don't restrict FIBMAP unless you've some better reason.  But do
feel free to fix the messages.
