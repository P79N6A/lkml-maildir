Subject: Solved? Repeatable File Corruption (ECS K7S5A w/SIS735)

I have been considering buying some computers systems based on the SiS735
chipset (specifically the ECS K7S5A motherboard), but was disturbed by
reports in late October
(
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0110.3/0465.html
) of
repeatable file corruption when running linux on these systems.  This would
be about the time of the 2.4.13 kernel.
There was no report (that I can find, at least) of this problem ever being
fixed.  Has it been fixed?  The person who originally reported the problem
has also not heard anything about the problem being fixed, and is preparing
to spend a significant amount of money on swapping out the ECS motherboards
for other boards.
This chipset and motherboard appear to make a very good, low cost system,
but I can't use it if I don't know for sure that the Linux kernel supports
the IDE subsystem properly.
Thanks in advance for your assistance,
