The spinlock v writel case is not guaranteed on other platforms and
requires you use mmiowb. The main memory v writel ordering is half
guaranteed for PCI bus only .. viz:
The following is ok
	fooblock->command = 1;
	writel(&fooblock_phys, pci_addr);   /* mem write seen */
The following is not
	fooblock->command = 1;
	writel(&fooblock_phys, pci_addr);
	fooblock->command = 2;		/* could occur before PCI */
