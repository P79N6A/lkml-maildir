Well take a socket with 64K of buffering. You don't want to wake processes
waiting in select or in write every time you can scribble another 1460 bytes
to the buffer. Instead you wait until there is 32K of room then wake the
user. That means that there is one wakeup/trip through userspace every 32K
rather than potentially every time a byte is read the other end
