pata_cs5535 won't drive a 5536 -- they're completely different beasts.
So you haven't been testing what you think you're testing...
Try booting your pata_cs5536 kernel with libata.dma=0
I also suggest you try a kernel with pata_amd compiled in instead of
pata_cs5536.  Slight timings aside there shouldn't be any functional
difference between the way the two drivers configure things.  But let
us know how that goes.  And include the diff of the relevant portion
of the boot logs.
Finally - which drive is it?
