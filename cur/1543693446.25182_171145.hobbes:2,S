*sigh* I can use it with ethernet instead of USB. I don't mind 
installing a new piece of hardware in order to run Linux, but I'd like 
it to be "fully" compatible for the masses. Who in the kernel team would 
likely be able to come up with an USB driver if sent one of those 
devices? You? You? You over there? The fellow in the back row with the 
nose piercing? ;)
