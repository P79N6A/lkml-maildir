At first glance it looks like acpi didn't come on in the kexec'd kernel.
Do you see anything like the line below.
> [ 78.139976] ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:1d.7[D] -> GSI 23 (level, low) -> IRQ
Could your provide the full bootlogs instead of these partial ones?
There is enough context missing I don't think anyone can do more than 
agree you are seeing a problem.
