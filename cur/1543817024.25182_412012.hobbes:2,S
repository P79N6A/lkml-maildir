It's a nifty idea, a sort of uClibc of C compilers. Alas it's useless on
almost all my systems because it's x86-only by design...

Good for it, as long as it doesn't go on to define __GNUC__ like icc did
at one point (even though it doesn't implement all GCC
extensions)... but Fabrice is sane so I doubt he'd do anything that
loopy.
