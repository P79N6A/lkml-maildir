The 68000 was a 32 bit CPU.  It had 32 bit registers and could do 32 bit
operations.  However, it had a 16 bit address bus and a 24 bit address
bus.  The address bus was implemented as 23 address lines (A1-A23), a
low byte select line, and a high byte select line.  IIRC when both the
low and high select lines were enabled, the data lines became interrupt
lines, selecting interrupts 0-15 (but it has been a while so I probably
don't RC).

I don't speak for anybody but myself - that's enough trouble.
