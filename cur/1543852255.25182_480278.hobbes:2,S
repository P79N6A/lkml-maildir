While compiling 2.6.19-rc4-mm2 on ia64, I met this compile error.
==
  CC [M]  drivers/acpi/processor_idle.o
drivers/acpi/processor_idle.c:43:22: asm/apic.h: No such file or directory
drivers/acpi/processor_idle.c: In function `acpi_processor_power_seq_show':
drivers/acpi/processor_idle.c:1202: warning: long long unsigned int format, u64 arg (arg 5)

This is because of acpi-include-apic-h.patch, maybe.
ia64 doesn't have asm/acpi.h
my .config is attached.
Thanks.
