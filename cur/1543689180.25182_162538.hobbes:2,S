ALi does support LBA48 in PIO mode. Right now the choice is 
DMA and 137Gb or no DMA and 200Gb, ideally it should be DMA
and fall back to PIO for the top 70Gb, but not yet a while.
I've actually not yet found a controller in my testing that cannot
manage LBA48 PIO, including nailing a 160Gb drive to a Cyrix box with
a VIA VP2.
