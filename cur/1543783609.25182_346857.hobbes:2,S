 Without powernow! feature, works fine.(I tested every -rc kernel 
after 2.6.8 for x86_64).
 With powernow! feature,works bad at least after 2.6.11-rc*.
 I'm using xserver-xorg at debian,6.8.2-dfsg.1-5 happend OOPS 
at any process using X any older kernel, but update X to 6.8.2-6,
any processes not/with using  X got  null exception and down
when enable powernow! feature :-(
 What happened? 
Ohta.
