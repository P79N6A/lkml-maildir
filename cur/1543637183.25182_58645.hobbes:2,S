2.6.x will run on alpha.  There are still a handfull of people that still 
activly maintian Linux on Alpha.   Since there is only a few people that 
activly work on Alpha, they tend to chose a kernel versions, then work with 
that version for a while until it is stable.  In the past few months most of 
the efforts have been spent on 2.4.9.  Currently there have been discussions 
in regard to:
1) porting all those patches for 2.4.9 forward to 2.4.[18-19] and 2.5.x.  
2) taking a look at the latest 2.5.x in the next few weeks, as we are aware 
that 2.5.x does not compile on Alpha.

It is certainly worth the time.  It is not too difficult to get any sane 
patch applied to the kernel for Alpha.

I have access to a Lab that is filled with Alpha systems.  I would be happy 
to test any patch as I have time.
Please let me know if I can be of further assistence.
