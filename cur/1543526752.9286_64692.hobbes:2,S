Im just a bit out of my depth here, but would it be possible to have
encrypted memory ?
Like the physical memory is encrypted but it is mapped to virtual memory
which is unencrypted, to get to this secure virtual memory, you would
have to use a special encryption module.
This may narrow the security risk to how the encryption module behaves
within the kernel.
I though of this when remember ages ago there was "ram doubler" software
for other operating systems that compressed memory, they allowed
programs to reside in memmory in compresed form.
Like i said, im out of my depth, maybe this would be just shifting the
problem, i hope im not just demonstrating my ignorance.
Thanks
