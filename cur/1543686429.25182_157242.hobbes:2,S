Dear Albert,
I have to tell you your are totally wrong :)
Most C programmers will find "!!x" less clear than "x != 0", simply
because "!!x" isn't used all that much.
If you require significant thought to parse "x != 0" you are going to
have trouble with more complex idioms.
Like "x && 1" and "x || 0", which are obvious to anyone :)
