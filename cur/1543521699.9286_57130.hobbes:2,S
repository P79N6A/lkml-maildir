If the hardware does 64 bit native arithmetic, I would expect it to use it.
If the hardware is more extensive, then it would use it, and reduce it down
to 64 bits just as it does for a normal bit field.
If I wanted it in a register, then I would say: register int var:64; This
should work since the compiler can already ignore the register declaration
if it determines that it isn't appropriate anyway.
If the hardware is more limited, then I would expect it to use a runtime
library to implement the correct arithmetic, in the most efficient manner
for that hardware.
If I wanted an unsigned value I would say "unsigned int var:64", or
"unsigned var:64".

Yup. Fixes the names, but doesn't fix the functionality. 128 bit integers
become usefull with IP version 6. A 4K bit number would be usefull with
encryption (and poll vectors? maybe not). The construct would/could
even simplify inittypes.h. It would even be usefull for compatability
between various hardware platforms. At least a users need for a specific
number of bits could be met in all cases (even if a bit inefficently).
It really depends on the application as to where it would be usefull.
