Ted,
Thanks for clarifying. It does NOT work this way today, and the 
detection of and translation of
LABEL=/ is passed in the kernel, so its a kernel issue. e2label also 
originated here, and yes I know about where
its stored. I will modify the kernels we use to translate this into a 
dynamic device handle. What
the rest of the world does is its problem. I was making a suggestion. 
See subject = "suggestions".
Thanks for responding. This has been helpful.
