It's not so bad when it is combined with per user resource quotas. The
system doesn't fail. The user fails, and then gets aborted. Since all
processes being signaled should/would be owned by the user (as is the
amount of resources involved) only that specific user would have a
problem. Then the he usual deadlock detection techniques could/would be
used to select a single process to abort.
