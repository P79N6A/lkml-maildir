It's probably not a big deal, because I'm not worried about the
failure of standard crypto primitives, but--
Do you know of any analysis to back up the claim that /dev/random
will be robust in the failure of crypto primitives?  I have never
seen anyone try to do such an analysis, but maybe you know of something
that I don't.
