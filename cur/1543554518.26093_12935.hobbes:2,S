Hi,
My lockup problems started increasing in frequency, and it
became obvious that they were independent of the kernel I
booted. The shoe dropped, nic was failing. It's salvage now.
The bizarre shift errors on ftp are gone, so the data I sent
is irrelevant to the kernel.
The soft hangs I was getting were real, though perhaps
encouraged by nic failure. Your net/ipv4/tcp.c patch from
the NE2000 thread cured them even before I found the
hardware fault. Has that patch gone to the queue? I
recommend it.
Thanks,
Tom
