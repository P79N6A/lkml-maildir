Hello guys,
Since some weeks we are facing troubles with systems running 2.0.36.
From time to time (this means > 20 a day) tasks are raising %CPU till 95%
When this situation occurs, all tasks requiring access to DB (15 threads)
are locked for 1 till 2 minutes.
Recently we introduced a top shell and discovered this situation 
happens when a task is exiting. Until now we suspected our DB server (Solid 2.3)
but recently this problem appeared when a program not using the DB
was exiting.
Are there some tools/utilities/procedure we can use to better determine the
source of this problem ?
Regards
E. Soriano
