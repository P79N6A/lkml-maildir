Hmm...I was just going to go with the "because I told you so" approach
that I use with my kids.  It works so well with them after all.

I agree with just about everything you've said, and am tweaking things
accordingly.  But...

Instead, it seems to me that the process is crucially important.
Reviewed-by shouldn't be a rubber stamp that somebody applies to a
patch; I think it should really imply that issues of interest have been
communicated to the developers.  If we are setting expectations for what
Reviewed-by means, I would prefer to leave an explicit mention of
communication in there.  If I'm in the minority here, though, it can
certainly come out.
Thanks,
