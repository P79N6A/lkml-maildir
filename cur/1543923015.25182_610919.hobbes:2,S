I think there are two other problems regarding LSM.
(1) There is only one "struct security_ops" structure in the system.
(2) There is only one "void *security" field in "struct task_struct".
Years ago, there was only one MAC implementation (i.e. SELinux)
in the mainline kernel.
But now, there are many MAC (or access control/tracking) implementations
waiting for inclusion into the mainline kernel.
The competition for occupying "struct security_ops" has started.
My idea is that, why not create chains of "struct security_ops"
(i.e. linked list of "struct security_ops")
and allow choosing which chain to use for per a "struct task_struct" basis
(i.e. add "struct security_ops" to "struct task_struct").
TOMOYO Linux is having difficulty that TOMOYO Linux unlikely be able to use
"struct security_ops" since SELinux is occupying it.
Yes, there is secondary_ops in SELinux, but it doesn't help TOMOYO Linux
since SELinux is not calling secondary ops for operations TOMOYO Linux wants to control.
So, there is only one "struct security_ops" as a matter of practice.
At the same time, the competition for occupying "void *security" has started.
My idea is that, why not allow multiple "void *security" fields in "struct task_struct"?
TOMOYO Linux is having difficulty that TOMOYO Linux unlikely be able to use
"struct task_struct"->security field since SELinux is occupying it.
If TOMOYO Linux is permitted to add "void *" and "u32" to "struct task_struct",
SELinux and other LSM implementations can use "struct task_struct"->security field.
May be we should consider stackable LSM again?
Regards.
