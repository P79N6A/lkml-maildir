I think it just died. I also have an USB mouse which is working 
fine, but I rebooted under 2.6.15 to see if the gamepad would 
return to live and it didn't.
About the motherboard, it's an ECS K7VTA 5.0 which I bought 
almost 3 years ago. Poorly grounded, probably, but not worse 
than it was before.
