Yes,  they are.  The cachep->spinlock goes away at many places due to the 
colour_next patch and keeping the l3 around. (we should not have called that 
optimization I guess :)), and the irq disabling had to be moved to the 
l3 lock anyways.  Maybe I could have done away with patch 2 (merged it with 
patch3), but I thought keeping them seperate made it readable ....
Patchset against rc2 follows.
Thanks,

PS: Many hotplug fixes are yet to be applied upstream I think.  I know
these slab patches work well with mm4 (with the x86_64 subtree and hotplug 
fixes in there) but I cannot really test cpu_up after cpu_down on rc2 
because it is broken as of now (pending merges, I guess).
