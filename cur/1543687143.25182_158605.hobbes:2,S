As a general thing, when people report this problem (or any other problem),
can they please include at least the following details please:
- make/model of machine
- type of cardbus bridge (from lspci)
- type of card (pcmcia or cardbus)
- make/model of card
- full kernel dmesg (including yenta, card services messages)
- cardmgr messages from system log
