Hello all,
I am still having these strange boot-delays which I reported in [0] when 
I was under the assumption that ohci1394 was to blame, simply because 
"ohci1394: aborting transmission" was the last message before the 
3minute delay during bootup happened. I've found out that the actual 
problem started way earlier (2.6.14->2.6.15) and I have bisected my way 
down to this patchset:
a7fd67062efc5b0fc9a61368c607fa92d1d57f9e is first bad commit

     [PATCH] add sysfs attr to re-emit device hotplug event
     A "coldplug + udevstart" can be simple like this:
       for i in /sys/block/*/*/uevent; do echo 1 > $i; done
       for i in /sys/class/*/*/uevent; do echo 1 > $i; done
       for i in /sys/bus/*/devices/*/uevent; do echo 1 > $i; done

Wtihout this patch, booting is fine, no delays. With this patchset, I 
notice a 3 minute delay.
However, as the patch-description tells me, it only introduces something 
in /sys/..../*/uevent and the delay is in fact triggered by userspace!
My distribution of choice (Ubuntu/6.06 LTS) does "something" in /sys 
during execution of /etc/init.d/udev (from: udev-079-0ubuntu34). Please 
see this url for details, logs, .config and more:

Many thanks for hints on what to do here. This issue is 100% 
reproducible and is kinda annoying now that I happen to be on-site when 
the machine boots up. As mentioned earlier I had no access to the box 
for a few months and did not pay attention to the boot-process and did 
not track -current too, that's why I'm whining about 2.6.15-problems 
when we're actually at 2.6.18-* already....
Thanks,
Christian.
