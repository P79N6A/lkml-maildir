that would fix it too indeed, OTOH I think changing the empty zone
handling in the kernel is beyond the scope of the bugfix (grep for
zone->size in mm/*.c :). Certainly making empty zones transparent to the
vm sounds much cleaner from a mm/*.c point of view but it may be faster
to skip the block with a branch instead of always computing it.
