fully agreed. queued events / batch notifications would also be kind of nice.
the fact that it is not possible to see if a file write has been 
completely written out currently (i.e, written to and then closed) 
is quite frustrating. anyone got any ideas for this?
currently i'm doing the ugly - readdir on dnotify signal, then
check mtime's to see if > 5 seconds, and just assume the writing
process has finished, then force a readdir in case any events
were missed while dnotify notification was off.
mvg,
Alex
