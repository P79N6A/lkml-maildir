	Mark, sorry, but requiring modules to *have* a resident part is what
makes life unpleasant. I know about kmem_cache_shrink(), indeed. Think of
modules debugging, where you may have the size of cache elements changing
across the rmmod/insmod and definitely do not want to reboot after
recompiling. And keeping stubs for all filesystems would be ugly.
	How serious are problems with destroying a totally shrinked slab?
*This* part may be as slow as it wants - it isn't something speed-critical.

	Fine. For the time being I'll simply use kmalloc/kfree.
