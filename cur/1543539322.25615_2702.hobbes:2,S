Subject: [patch-2.4.0-test5-pre3] struct inode shortened

Hi Linus,
Why aren't inode->i_pipe and inode->i_bdev in a union? Surely one
cannot find an inode that is a pipe and a block device at the same time...
That will save the precious 4 bytes from struct inode. (or 8 on 64bit
arch). And on a system with 1000000 incore inodes that is a lot of bits :)
Regards,
Tigran
