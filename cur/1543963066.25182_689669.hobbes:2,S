Well, considering just *how* bad the new BKL apparently is, I think that's 
a separate issue. The semaphore implementation is simply not worth it. At 
a minimum, it should be a mutex.

Quite frankly, maybe we _need_ to have a bad BKL for those to ever get 
fixed. As it was, people worked on trying to make the BKL behave better, 
and it was a failure. Rather than spend the effort on trying to make it 
work better (at a horrible cost), why not just say "Hell no - if you have 
issues with it, you need to work with people to get rid of the BKL 
rather than cluge around it".
