I don't expect admins to switch "privacy" on and off very often.  Once
would be enough, I hope.
Mount options would be easier to use, I agree, but I doubt the added
complexity is worth it.  Kernel options for procfs are not _that_
magical because the kernel mounts it internally, so it's a kernel part,
not a real filesystem ;-)
One question I couldn't find a good answer for regarding remount
options: what to do with processes that have cd'd into a /proc/<pid> dir
belonging to another user when the privacy option is being turned on?
Letting them keep their access is counter-intuitive and taking it away
would need quite invasive changes compared to my patch, I think.

You mean using ptrace_may_attach() and/or MAY_PTRACE() for determining
access to all (or at least more) files in /proc/<pid> instead of my
proposed "chmod 500"?  What are the advantages?
Thanks,
René
