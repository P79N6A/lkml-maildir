Why bother? It is only 16 bytes. Look at these:
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root      1089889 Jul  8  1998 bash
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root       138812 Jan 10  1998 gawk
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root       580716 Jul  1  1998 rpm
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root       257212 Jan 10  1998 tcsh
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root       294812 Jan 10  1998 vim
That is just the /bin directory. There are some real treasures in
/usr/bin and /usr/X11/bin, including a 3186694-byte monster.
(remember, those 16 bytes are only needed when loading the executable)
Bit stealing is ugly. For only 0.01% to 0.1% savings, no thanks.

OK, this seems useful.

The nice error messages are almost enough reason alone. With the
additional possibility of a DoS attack, I think the cost is justified.
