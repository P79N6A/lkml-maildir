I think we're just rediscovering the floppy and i8042 issues that we found
and fixed in -mm a while back.  The i8042 patch is contained in here:
 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.10-rc2/2.6.10-rc2-mm1/broken-out/bk-input.patch
I have no idea whether this will apply directly to Linus' kernel, or
whether it depends on other patches, but it should fix the problem.
