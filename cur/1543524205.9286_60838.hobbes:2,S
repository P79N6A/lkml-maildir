Hello,
Relevant info:
RedHat 6.1
AMD K6-2 400Mhz processor
FIC 503+ Motherboard
128Mb PC100 DRAM
Kingston KNE-100TX ethernet card
I've been using Donald Becker's kern-2.3 drivers, in this case, the Tulip
0.91x driver.  The card comes up ok and everything works fine for awhile
and then my network connection will freeze.  Sometimes there's a message
about eth0 being hung but more often than not, the logs show no indication
that anything is wrong.  Often, I can just restart the interface and
everything continues.  However, about 25% of the time, I get a kernel oops
when I do this (see below) .  All further attempts to use ifconfig
generate this oops including (obviously) the one in the shutdown script.  
This results in me having to do a hard reboot, with the obligitory
looooong fsck.
On a perhaps related note, I also appear to have some SCSI related
hardware problems, wherein the bus is reset way too often.  From a purely
anecdotal viewpoint, it seems my SCSI problems and ethernet card problems
exacerbate one another, although it might be purely coincidence.  I don't
know if this sheds any light on the problem or not.
I know that kernel 2.3.X is winding down and is mostly in a feature
freeze.  It would seem, however, that Donald's 2.3.X ethernet drivers,
haven't had the chance to undergo a lot of testing, since they haven't
even been included in the official kernel release yet.  I know that to use
my Tulip card, I need at least a 0.91g driver - the 0.89H driver won't
work.  So is the idea to ship a 2.4 kernel that supports a bunch of older
cards but not many of the newer ones?  
The oops:
