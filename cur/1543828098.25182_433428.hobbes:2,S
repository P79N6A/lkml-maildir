That is not how user space TLS works. It usually has a base a register.

14 cycles is not a 100 times longer.

This means it cannot be cache colored (because you would need a static
offset) and you couldn't share task_structs on a page.
Also you would make task_struct part of the userland ABI which
seems like a very very bad idea to me. It means we couldn't change
it anymore.
