I think so, but do not have time to check all details.
Now the first parameter of mm_release() always is current,
so that this parameter is superfluous. Similarly, the only
parameter of exit_mm() always is current, and hence is superfluous.
Maybe it is a good idea to remove the pretense that these routines
might do something useful for general parameters, now that
deactivate_mm() does sneaky global things.
