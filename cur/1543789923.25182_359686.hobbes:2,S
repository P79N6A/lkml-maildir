This effectively illustrates the wrong thing to do:  duplicating 
information that's already in Scsi_Host_Template.
Just use Scsi_Host_Template in the LLDD and see where that goes.

Correct.  That's why there is resistance to aic94xx's approach of 
creating a totally new "strict SAM" path, existing in parallel with the 
traditional SCSI core.  You need to evolve the existing code to get 
there.  Such changes are gradual, involving more than one developer, etc.
We don't need one small set of SCSI drivers behaving differently from 
the vast majority of existing SCSI drivers.
Hear me now, and believe me later:  we all largely agree on the points 
you've raised about legacy crapola in the SCSI core.  James, Christoph, 
myself, and several others disagree with your assertion that the old 
SCSI core should exist in parallel with your new SCSI core.
We differ on the path, not the goal.  As a thought experiment, you could 
try simply implementing the changes requested, and see where that goes.
