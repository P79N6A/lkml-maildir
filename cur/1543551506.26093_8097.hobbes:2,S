   Doesn't boot on alpha systems with pci-pci bridges.  I sent a
   report about this a couple days ago and noone responds.
Richard Henderson knows about this bug and it requires quite a bit of
painful surgery.  I believe his wording that more interesting work
would be cleaning his cat's litter boxes.
Later,
