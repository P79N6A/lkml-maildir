Not really, there are PCI boards containing an UHCI controller,
so unless there are chip bugs it should work in an Alpha board too.
The Intel asm construct is there because the locking between
the CPU and the bus master engine on the UHCI chip is quite
hairy. To add Alpha support an alpha geek has to think about
these issues.
