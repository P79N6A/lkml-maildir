It probably makes sense to talk about this up in Ottowa.

Well the rewrite of the history may simply be an ordering change.
It isn't so much the reviewability of a single piece but the reviewability
of the whole that I am worried about.  I have had one occasion lately
where I made a small simple sane change but I discovered that there
was one little hack I had to get rid of to make everything work.
To remove that hack required me to refactor another piece of code and
was more work than the original change.  That refactoring then had to happen
first, when the code was merged with the rest of the kernel.
So while we should try to keep our pieces as sane as possible we should
assume we have to rewrite history from our sandbox when we push the code
upstream.
