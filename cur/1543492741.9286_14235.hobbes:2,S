Yes, and make sure you explicitly give them equal priorities.
% /sbin/swapon -s
Filename                        Type            Size    Used    Priority
/dev/sda2                       partition       21500   1976    1
/dev/sdb2                       partition       20476   2084    1
/scratch/SWAPFILE               file            40956   412     1
(from fstab)
/dev/sda2       none            swap    sw,pri=1                0       0
/dev/sdb2       none            swap    sw,pri=1                0       0
/scratch/SWAPFILE none          swap    sw,pri=1                0       0
It's been my experience that if you don't specify a priority it will fill 
up the first swap, then the second, then the third, instead of
spreading the swap out across different drives.  I noticed a big
performance jump when I gave explicit priorities on this old
486..
