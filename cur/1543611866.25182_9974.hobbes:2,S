Yes.
Because smp_init() is later in place than console_init(), printk() can be
called in such a situation.
For example, in IA-64, identify_cpu() is called before ia64_mmu_init(),
while identify_cpu() calls printk() in it.
I don't think the ordering itself is a problem.

The reason I put it in release_console_sem() is that release_console_sem()
can be called from other functions than printk(), e.g. console_unblank().
I agree with you that it is clearer but I think it is not sufficient.
Best regards.
