    Indeed. The man page is out of date: The info file for glibc 2.1
    says:
     - Function: int remove (const char *FILENAME)
         This is the ISO C function to remove a file.  It works like
         `unlink' for files and like `rmdir' for directories.  `remove' is
         declared in `stdio.h'.
Good. Updated remove.3.
