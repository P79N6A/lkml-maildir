    Hi Hans :)
    I've not read the code in order to not make assumptions about
proper parameters or how to make the tests. I've tested using an AMD
Athlon XP 1900+, using a self compiled 2.4.29 kernel. The measures
were made using zsh 'time'. Not quite exact but I think that's good
for comparisons anyway.

    With 3-1 I get an usage of 20% more or less. But with 16-1 the
CPU usage is nearly 0! and with 16-16 the usage is 5% more or less.

    Not here. It uses 29% instead of 20% with 3-1, but drops to 6%
when using 16 processes. Far from full CPU usage. A test with 16-160
doesn't make the system slower or irresponsive, at least here...

    Not here. I haven't noticed any slow-down or latency increase
using high number of messages. Using 16-160 only uses at most 7% of
CPU per process, and I don't feel the system irresponsive.
    If you want more accurate results, try to modify your test
programs: make them run for a couple of minutes (you decide how much
time, the longer, the better) and kill all children processes. After
that, use getrusage() (with RUSAGE_CHILDREN) or wait3(). That should
give more accurate results.
    Hope that helps. If you want to make any other test, tell me.
I'll try to help.
