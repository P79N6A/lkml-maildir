Well, I can confirm that it is in the errata internally available in a 
document marked 5/14/2001.  I had difficulty finding any errata 
listings for the 7400 on our external site, though.

Yeah, the 7410 had some small microarchitectural and architectural 
changes.  Changes that mean it can't necessarily be used in the same 
socket as the 7400.  Votages were modified, and some memory interfacing 
was changed.  Also, it was a significantly different process (a major 
shrink), so it gets a new name.  The various versions of the 7400 are 
all in the same sized process (with slightly different transistors, I 
think).

True.  But I'm going to have to think about this one more, before I 
agree with you.  :)

I'm fairly certain they do shut off the instant the interrupt happens 
if they aren't supposed to count privileged events, but I'd have to do 
some testing to prove it.  The issue is that MSR[EE] takes 2 cycles to 
be written.

The 604 and 604e both have performance monitors.  I can't find anything 
which says that this is a bug in them.  However, being as this bug 
managed to creep into the 7400/7410, I'm not willing to say that the 
bug didn't exist in all of those processors.  More testing would be 
necessary.
BTW, I am also interested in helping out with this code.  Meanwhile, 
I'll attempt to find the answers to those questions.
