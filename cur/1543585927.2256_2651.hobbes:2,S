Hi,
Can I build the linux kernel 2.4.0 for MIPS(R3000) processor.
I have cross compiler and binutils intstalled on my host m/c (x86).
Will it compile ?
Do I need to do any extra patche for MIPS ?
Does the built image work ?
Any input or suggestion are welcome.
</// Pls reply to me personally as I am not the member of this mailing list.

Thanks and regards,
Nazim
