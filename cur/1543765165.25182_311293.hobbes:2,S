No, I would not.
Creating a derivative work requires creativity, and a linker is not
creative.
The copyright issues for the linked program are the copyright issues
for the unlinked program.
Of course, you might have evidence in the form of a linked program where
you don't have evidence in the form of an unlinked program.  But that's
a practical issue, not a copyright issue.

The first sale doctrine (basically, 17 USC 109) doesn't really say that.

I don't think the words you're using mean what you think they mean.
I'm just going to quote part of 17 USC 106 at you.
"... the owner of copyright ... has the exclusive rights to ...
prepare derivative works ...".
Go look it up yourself if you think the text I've omitted makes it mean
something different.
