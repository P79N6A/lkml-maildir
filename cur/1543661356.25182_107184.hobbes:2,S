	In this case, the degradation is quite graceful. The Wireless
Tools just assume that the card doesn't support Wireless Extension, so
you won't get extra stats and configuration, but you can still use the
driver.

	I believe that *BSD consider all system tools as part of the
base OS, and is compiled alongside the kernel, so you don't have this
issue, because kernel and tools are "in sync".
	Anyway, I believe that 64 bit platforms will need to become
mainstream before the issue of wireless on 64 bit is pressing, and by
that time most distro will have made the jump.

	It's just a shame that it's not more distinctive, because the
error message wouldn't lead me to think "doh, I need a recompile".

	They use the device private ioctls and subclass them. They use
one ioctl to query the driver for support of the API.

	Of course, because you have dealt with the most common
subset. I want to remain pragmatic and try to define how far we need
to go. 100% coverage is unrealistic, and there is always the tradeof
between amount of work and number of users.
	I just believe that in thise case the number of users is not
there yet, and we can re-evaluate our options when we have those
users, because at that point we may have new options available.
	Also note that I made a first step in your direction. Since
WE-13, most of the metadata describing the ioctls is in the kernel
itself and the copy_to/from_user is centralised, which should make
things easier once all drivers are converted...
