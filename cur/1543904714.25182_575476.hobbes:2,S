such a knob already exists to a certain degree, but i havent tested its 
full effects on SMP fairness yet. If you pull my scheduler tree:
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mingo/linux-2.6-sched.git
and if you enable CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG, then all the sched-domain 
parameters become runtime tunable under /proc/sys/cpu*.
Could you try to increase the cross-CPU rebalancing frequency and see 
how it impacts the precision of your measurement? Tune 'min_interval' 
and 'max_interval' down to increase the frequency of rebalancing.
