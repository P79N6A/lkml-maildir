We don't use the code in the driver straight away [2] (in the case
that i mentioned), since that happens in the hardware (demodulator
chip) [1], but we have an interface for selecting the code-rate [2]
(LDPC/BCH) for DVB-S2 and the new papers for DVB-T2 looks geared that
the base decision is to use LDPC.
Though i now see a patent application for it [3]. Not sure whether it
is a registered patent, i am under an agreement of Non-Disclosure with
STM. Will ask the relevant person there, whether they have it
registered. (Most probably they may have it registered).
There are a few people from STM on LK, if not they can possibly
confirm whether the patent is regsitered or not.
