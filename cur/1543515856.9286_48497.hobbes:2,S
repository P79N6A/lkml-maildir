Sure. I do it the same, too (and also have a lilo bootsector on floppy with
a map on hdc, so as to be able to boot on hdc even if hda is unfriendly).

Hum. I never had any problem with my old (external) SCSI2 drive on an SC200,
but obviously YMMV. How do you determine that bays at hotswappable?
A crash test with an old drive on that IDE rack
indicates the drive copes well with hot(un)plugging
(using hdparm -f -Y /dev/hda before unplugging).
The remaining problem to me is about convincing the kernel
to re-read the drive's geometry and information, after re-plugging
(and no, I can't just rmmod and insmod the IDE subsystem,
since it's necessary to support the root partition on /dev/hdc).
PS: as for something completely different; I suppose this is a known bug,
but while using mutt 1.0i over NFS, I could kind of hang up the whole
2.2.{12,13,13ac1}'s VFS subsystem while mutt tried to lock the NFS'ed
~/Mail/received. During the hang up, processes wouldn't run,
but VT switching and IP pinging and forwarding would behave normally.
Killing mutt with SAK would have the machine resume normal operation.
Latest debian potato on both machines, with rpc.nfsd on 2.2.13 on the server
(oops; I'll be retrying with knfsd shortly).

Obviously, a man's judgement cannot be better than the information on which he
has based it.  Give him the truth and he may still go wrong when he has
the chance to be right, but give him no news or present him only with distorted
and incomplete data, with ignorant, sloppy or biased reporting, with propaganda
and deliberate falsehoods, and you destroy his whole reasoning processes, and
make him something less than a man.
