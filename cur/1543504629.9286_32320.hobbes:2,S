Mingo,
did you find additional spots which cold be RAM-size related like in my case ?
Yesterday I retested latencies with mem=32m (without swap what a pain :-)  ),
and got about 6ms on disk writes, better than the 64m,128m and 256m case.
If I get some time I will try out Roger's profiling patch let's see if I can
find this nasty function which ruins your nice flat diagrams! 
:-)
Note that sometime I must run the test 2-3times to get  greater than 5ms
latencies.
regards,
Benno.
