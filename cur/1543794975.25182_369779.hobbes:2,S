Maybe I found the answer to it :)
I listed the dentry-state in several other normal machines, they all have
more than 10k unused dentries:
        54215   42155   45      0       0       0
        91704   81376   45      0       0       0
        96304   88832   45      0       0       0
        30057   26999   45      0       0       0
Then I disabled the shrinker by:
        echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/vfs_cache_pressure
That increased the number from
        3393    28      45      0       0       0
to
        6247    2672    45      0       0       0
And there is no sudden huge increases of free pages any more.
Maybe your patch is shrinking the slabs much more, though I cannot confirm this
from the source code. But one thing I'm sure is that there should be a lower
bound for the unused dentries, either absolutely or relatively, something like
this:
--- linux-2.6.15-rc1-mm2.orig/fs/dcache.c
+++ linux-2.6.15-rc1-mm2/fs/dcache.c
@@ -860,7 +860,7 @@ static int shrink_dcache_memory(int nr, 
 			return -1;
 		prune_dcache(nr);
 	}
-	return (dentry_stat.nr_unused / 100) * sysctl_vfs_cache_pressure;
+	return (dentry_stat.nr_unused / 1000) * 10 * sysctl_vfs_cache_pressure;
 }
 
 /**
The original 100 is way too small. It should be much more than the SHRINK_BATCH(128).
Thanks,
Wu
