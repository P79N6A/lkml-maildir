Hi All,
The header fields in the sk_buff structure have been renamed and are
no longer unions.
Networking code and drivers are supposed to use skb->transport_header,
skb->network_header, and skb->skb_mac_header.
But when I am trying to access fields of TCP using the code
struct tcphdr *tcp = skb->transport_header;
tcp->   //accessing proper field
It is not accessing the value properly ...
Can anyone please help me ???
Thanks in advance
Regards
Juliet
