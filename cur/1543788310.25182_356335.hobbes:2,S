Yes it should be using unsigned long. The actual flag word is still
only 32bit, but the inline assembly expects 64bit. And save_flags 
might corrupt the target if it's too small.
Normally you should get a warning from warn_if_not_ulong() though.
You didn't get it in that case?  I don't remember any such warnings
from the ACPI code.
Which code does it exactly?
