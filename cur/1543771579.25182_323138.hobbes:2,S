Looks pretty nice, but your usage of asm-generic is totally wrong.
files in asm-generic must only ever be used for default implementations
of asm/ headers, and _never_ be included from common code.  But your
asm-generic files are only ever used from linux/spinlock.h, so there's
no point at all in splitting them out in the first time.
Similarly there's no point in a separate linux/spinlock_smp.h and
linux/spinlock_up.h - it'll only cause some driver writers to include
either of them directly and break the build for either UP or SMP.
If you absolutely want to split them add an #error if not included from
spinlock.h
Little nitpick no 2: please include linux/*.h always before asm/*.h
(in linux/jbd.h)
