Ohh.. ok..
So.
1) Its more a HW problem? (a PRocessor problem?) I have AMD K6
2) So.. you are telling me that I cant solve it? :(, only if I change the
proccessor to a Pentium?..

it's an instruction, "conditional move", which appeared first
in the Intel P6, and is not supported by your processor.

no, it's not a kernel issue.  the problem is the binary module
you are trying to use: whoever compiled it chose compiler flags
that make it impossible to use on your CPU (any CPU which lacks
cmov, such as all pentium's (P5), K6, etc.  athlons, though,
have cmov.)

none.  strictly a problem with the module.
