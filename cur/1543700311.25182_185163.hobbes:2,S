Not when apic is disabled. (And I'm guessing you mean 2.4, right?
Although IIRC the patches are available for both.)
The patches for enabling/using apic/io-apic on nforce2 work fine, except
instead of oopsing it hardlocks semi-randomly. (It ran fine for a few
days, then hardlocked, and upon reboot it only made it about 10 minutes,
then another 30 minutes, so I went back to an unpatched 2.4.23 with
'noapic'.  Now that the hardware has arrived I can move production
elsewhere and do further testing.)  I was under the impression that
nmi-watchdog was supposed to prevent the hardlocks (well, turn them into
oopses), but no such luck here.
