It's was in OSDI '99.  You can find a copy at Druschel's web page:

This seems complicated.  How about having a kernel thread whose task it is
to run bottom half handlers?  If it ran at the highest priority in the
system, then things would work more or less as they do now.  However, it
could be preempted by RT threads of sufficiently high priority.
