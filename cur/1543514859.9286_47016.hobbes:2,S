Because we have caches that are not associated with any particular inode.
(swap, for one). Moreover, we don't actually need to know the inode - just
a small subset. Said subset makes perfect sense for any sort of page cache
and switching to that allows to avoid fake inodes. Moreover, it lets us
use several caches per inode, etc. And makes for cleaner code, IMHO.
