We actually experimented with usleep(0) and select(...) with a zeroed 
timeval. Both of these approaches performed worse than just using 
sched_yield(), depending on the system and some other conditions. 
Dual-core AMD64 vs single-CPU had quite different behaviors. Also, if 
the slapd main event loop was using epoll() instead of select(), the 
select's used for yields slowed down by a couple orders of magnitude. (A 
test that normally took ~30 seconds took as long as 45 minutes in one 
case, it was quite erratic.)
It turned out that most of those yield's were leftovers inherited from 
when we only supported non-preemptive threads, and simply deleting them 
was the best approach.
