And also for 2.2. 2.2.18pre18/19 should ident the CPU fine. A contributed patch
should also report the caches correctly in 2.2.18pre20 once I release it.
The big 2.4 issue is that 2.4 won't work with a CPU running at 2GHz or higher
(2.2.18 will be the first 2.2 kernel handling this). The changes have yet to be
pushed into 2.4. Thus judging by Intels noises so far it will only be early
PIV processors that work ;)
