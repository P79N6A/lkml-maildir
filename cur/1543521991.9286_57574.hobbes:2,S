My point is: (3) allows to tolerate violation of (2) legally, by means
of HTTP or FTP. Thus, while making a CD that the NSA cannot even see if
you do it properly---hey, no-one said the FTP site needed to be publicly
accessible... :o)---you can safely export your CD's contents via FTP. 
So what reason is there? There's a shorter way to write "if you export
strong crypto to Iraq or <whateverelseisblackliste>, do it by
FTP/HTTP".
