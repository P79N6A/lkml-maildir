	This driver is not finished, and for the time being quite limited,
but
it works for me. I use it to initialized a custom PPC board without bios.
And, this driver work the same way on an intel box.
There is no function to change the resolution, this one need to be written,
but I think this driver is better and more universal than the previous one
that
work only on a special PPC architecture.
	I have tested this driver with the VGA output only, and I don't know
if
	it can work without changes with a notebook. But there is some
functions
	to dump the internal registers, this is a fast way to change the
configuration.
	I know, the manual of this chip is available on the intel web site.
	If you have patch or improvement, I will be pleased to add them to
	this driver.
