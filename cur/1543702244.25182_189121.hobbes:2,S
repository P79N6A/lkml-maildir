Indeed, we _can_ rely on the kernel partition support, but the subnodes 
are needed to get at those partitions.
Obviously, a "repartitioning hotplug event" can create the subnodes, but 
that will fail exactly because it wouldn't allow the user to just access 
the nodes.

I hate those "background CPU users". Have you looked at "ps" output after 
something like kscd has run, and does a CD check every second? It's 
_expensive_. It goes all the way down to the hardware, sends a request 
to the device.
Doing it every five minutes wouldn't be an issue, but doing it every five 
minutes would be absolutely _horrible_ from a user perspective standpoint. 
If you insert a smartmedia card in your cardreader, you expect to be able 
to access it pretty much immediately when you start typing. So a second or 
two of delay is fine, but even just five or ten seconds are already bad.
So the choice is:
 - probe every removable device once a second
 - pre-populate the device nodes, and when the user presses the icon that 
   says "mount", it will just do so. Immediately. No delay at all.

It might be acceptable to create even just the first one, since things
like cameras etc only ever generate a single partition. But the
inconsistency would drive me mad. I'd just do all of them.
NOTE! We do have an alternative: if we were to just make block device 
nodes support "readdir" and "lookup", you could just do
	open("/dev/sda/1" ...)
and it magically works right. I've wanted to do this for a long time, but 
every time I suggest allowing it, people scream.
