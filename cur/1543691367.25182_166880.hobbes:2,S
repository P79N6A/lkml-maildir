According to what I've seen in the release notes of the closed-source
siimage driver (I posted what I found), the right fix could be in
netbsd's code, but in sys/dev/ata/wd.c :
         * Some Seagate S-ATA drives have a PHY which can get confused
         * with the way data is packetized by some S-ATA controllers.
         *
         * The work-around is to split in two any write transfer whose
         * sector count % 15 == 1 (assuming 512 byte sectors).
 
I'm not smart enough to try and write a patch, but maybe the siimage
maintainer could have a look to that file...
