  Sorry, can't believe I forgot this- this is with 2.6-test2-bk3.  I'll
have info on which kernel was the last to not exhibit this behavior
tonight, I hope (school, work, etc. in the way).

  Just IDE messages.
  Booting without the mentioned options, if I let it sit long enough, I
get the following message quite a few times:
swapper: page allocation failure. order:0, mode:0x20
  Also, if I hit the power button while it's frozen, it continues
booting- obvious problem with ACPI/PCMCIA, I suppose?
  Today it's actually sometimes booting to init without the pci/acpi
options (it seems to depend on whether I have a card in the slot,
actually), but at some point I get the following never-ending series of
errors:
  ACPI-0398: *** Error: acpi_ev_gpe_dispatch: No handler or method for
GPE[xx], disabling event
Thanks for helping me help. ;-)
