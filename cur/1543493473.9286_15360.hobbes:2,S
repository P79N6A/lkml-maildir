Not at all - that's exactly how it works at the moment. The first problem is 
that it changes the frequency of the 'current irq0 routine' slightly, because 
it's not exactly 'every 180th interrupt'. So it mucks up the clock accuracy.
The second problem, possibly related to the above, is that Linus doesn't
approve of such an arrangement, so while the PC speaker driver is working like
this, it's not got a chance of being included in 2.3.x. (This is hearsay - I
got that second hand at least. Confirmation would be very much appreciated,
Linus)
