After a sleep, I build up a clean 2.6.5-rc2-mm1, removed the two 
initramfs-* from the broken-out patches, and problem looks *quite* the same.
I managed to start init, but it fails somewhere in running scripts in 
rcS.d. I have :
README                S30checkfs.sh       S40networking
S01devfsd             S30etc-setserial    S41portmap
S02mountvirtfs        S30procps.sh        S45mountnfs.sh
S05bootlogd           S35devpts.sh        S46setserial
S05keymap.sh          S35mountall.sh      S48console-screen.sh
S09scsitools-pre.sh   S35mountkernfs      S50hwclock.sh
S10checkroot.sh       S38pppd-dns         S51ntpdate
S18hwclockfirst.sh    S39dns-clean        S55bootmisc.sh
S20dns-clean          S39ifupdown         S55urandom
S20module-init-tools  S39pppstatus-clean  S70nviboot
S20modutils           S40hostname.sh      S70xfree86-common
S22scsitools.sh       S40hotplug          S75sudo
I see *sometimes* the first devfsd message but almost nothing else. I 
think I also manage to partially initialize usbdevfs on /proc/bus/usb. 
It looks like due to an asynchronuous (irq) event, something deadlocks 
the machine.
