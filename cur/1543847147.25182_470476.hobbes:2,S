I'm tempted to submit a patch that just kills the warning.
The only known user is lipthreads from glibc performing.
if ! uname -v | grep "SMP" ; then
	....
fi
That code if it gets -ENOSYS reads /proc/sys/kernel/version,
and it has worked this way since the day it was written.
I have been looking for other uses of sys_sysctl but I haven't
found any.  Why glibc doesn't call uname like any normal
program when it wants to uname information is beyond me.
