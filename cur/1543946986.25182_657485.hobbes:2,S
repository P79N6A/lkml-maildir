Yep, you were right. They do share the same IRQ and the problem does go away.
Unfortunately  I can't run this machine with noapic. I need irq affinity.

Yes this is i386. Is it just a certain interrupt controller that acts this way or are there more?
I guess I have at least one of "those funny interrupt controllers"  Hmm
