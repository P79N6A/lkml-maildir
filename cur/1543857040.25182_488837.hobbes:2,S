I still have the same objection - the "simple'" code will have to be
compiled into the driver instead of being a separate module and
eventyally will lead to a monster-size HID module. We have this issue
with psmouse to a degree but with HID the growth potential is much
bigger IMO.
Jiri, I have not looked at your patches yet (I need to do that) but
what I was hoping to do (or have someone to do ;) ) is to provide
ability to define HID transport drivers (we would have USB transport
and bluetooth transport) and then say:
  device = hid_create_device(&my_transport);
  device->event = my_event_handler;
  ....
  hid_start_device(device);
hid-create_device would parse all reports and create "standard" hid
device. Then you have a chance to override and tweak it as you see
fit.
This way we could have several small drivers implementing quirks to
the generic HID driver. Most of the code is still in hid core module
but every individual driver is complete USB (or bluetooth) driver, has
its own device table and is loaded via standard driver code bust
matching/hotplug modalias mechanism.
Btw, I saw you moving it into drivers/hid, would not
drivers/input/hid/ suit better?
