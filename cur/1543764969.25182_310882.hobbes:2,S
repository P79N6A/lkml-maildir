If that did bother you, could you keep track of the actually
activated mm in your arch code? Or would that involve more arch
hooks and general ugliness in the scheduler?
Could you alternatively just disable interrupts across the switch?
I guess that would require a bit of #ifdefery in sched.c, which we
are trying to move away from, but it would be pretty minimal. Much
better than what is there now.

IMO it *is* the direction we should move towards. That is,
liberating context switching from scheduler locking, and providing
a single set of semantics for the context switch hooks for all
architectures.
No rush, of course. But it would be good to get it in sooner
or later.
