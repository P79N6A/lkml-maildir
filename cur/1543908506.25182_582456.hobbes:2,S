| Andrew,

| I'm not sure if this patch is the right fix for the bug.  But it do
| stops the oops message. The bug also happens in 2.6.23-rc1-mm2/2.6.23-rc2-mm2.
| I'm running debian/sid. The .config is attached.

Even if you're right you have to make the same patch for
mm/nommu.c but I've an anticipation the problem is growing
up from another point (and I'm really hoping that I'm wrong ;)
