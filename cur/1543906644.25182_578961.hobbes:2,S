Hi Matthew,
are you sure about windows suspending the HID devices in runtime? I have 
never seen LEDs of USB keyboard connected to windows host to go off after 
some time of not using it.
We have been playing with runtime autosuspend of HID devices, are 
currently postponed the full support, as it turns out that many devices 
don't support this feature properly (probably due to not being tested in 
Windows).
