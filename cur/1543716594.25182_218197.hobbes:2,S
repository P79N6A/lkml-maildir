Hello,
This might be related to the change in fs-writeback.c that fixed
redirtying inodes on NFS, but I'm not sure. It seems that the Slab cache
never shrinks. Could this be a memory leak? It definitely affects system
performance. Here are the numbers after running for about 12 hours with
heavy NFS traffic (this is the client).
What's the best way to see who is allocating Slab memory?
