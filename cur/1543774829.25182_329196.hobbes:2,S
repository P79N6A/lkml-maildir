Actually both of them use the same chip and same pci id (hint: you could
have used the proper PCI ID definition from pci_ids.h instead of adding
your own which is discouraged :)), so it's not as easy.
Stanislaw Skowronek has been done a lot of work on supporting the IOC3
fully, maybe you could get into contact with him?  I'm pretty sure
everyone in mips land is appreciating your fully featured serial
driver, let's just make sure it fits into the general framework.
