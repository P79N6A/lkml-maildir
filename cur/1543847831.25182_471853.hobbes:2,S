The pagebuf code doesn't use high-order allocations anymore; it uses
scatter lists and remapping to allow physically discontiguous pages
in a multi-page buffer. That is, the pages are sourced via
find_or_create_page() from the address space of the backing device,
and then mapped via vmap() to provide a virtually contigous mapping
of the multi-page buffer.
So I don't think this problem exists anymore...
Cheers,
Dave.
