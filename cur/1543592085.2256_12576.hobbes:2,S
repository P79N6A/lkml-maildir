  Folks, herewith I declare this topic ("ECN is on") TABOO, if
  you want to continue discussing it, do that at   linux-kernel
  WITH NEW TOPIC.
  My original message had  reply-to  pointing to  linux-kernel,
  but all it takes is single person to ignore that...
  Spare the other lists, my original intention was to "spread
  the word", as not everybody subscribes  linux-kernel ...
