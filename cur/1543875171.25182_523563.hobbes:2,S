Well, I've seen several bug reports on this issue -- but they're all
internal to Intel.
However, we do have here a real bug, which shows up on real hardware,
which will be released soon.  Obviously, I can't discuss release
schedules, but "soon" is a good word to use.  You might find out more if
you read The Register (wink, wink).
Given the time frame for release of 2.6.21, I'd be fine with skipping
2.6.20.x, and putting this in 2.6.21.  But we really don't want to wait
for 2.6.22.
I'll take Auke's suggestion and repost this Monday and cc linux-pci and
a slew of other people.
