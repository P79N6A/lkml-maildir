Subject probably says it.  Why is "GenuineIntel" the default vendor ID
reported by /proc/cpuinfo?  Seems  likely to cause a lot of confusion. 
(It sure confused me at first!)
I found a posting like this on the archives some while back, but with no
response...
Email reply would be appreciated, if convenient.
