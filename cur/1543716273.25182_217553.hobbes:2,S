Nope.  The real objection was misleading people about the license of the 
module.  That part was clearly wrong.
The fact that it dilutes Linux is a side-objection, and we're not making 
an objection so much as a warning about the potential long-term effects. 
  This part isn't clearly wrong so much as something to be concerned about.
At least, that's MY opinion on it.
