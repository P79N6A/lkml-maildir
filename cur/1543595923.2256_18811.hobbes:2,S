And if the other one is stable someone should spend the time merging the

For 2.5 that may wellk make sense. Personally I'd prefer someone worked out
why the qlogicfc driver behaves as it does. It sounds like two small bugs
nothing more
1.	That the FC event code wasnt updated from 2.2 so now runs
	with IRQ's off when it didnt expect it
2.	That someone has a slight glitch in the queue handling.
