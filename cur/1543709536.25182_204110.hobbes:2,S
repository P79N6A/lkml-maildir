If GDB is already connected and sitting by waiting, you can send the O
packet.  If it is not, you could delay sending the O packet until you
know that GDB has now connected.
This isn't an unworkable idea, but it's probably better to just set
*why_i_crashed (think work work work, oh wait, what caused this again?)
and provide some handy macros (which we should be in the docs anyhow).
