Richard,
It appears that struct inode i_ino has a special value of 0.  I don't
see a mention of that in vfs.txt, and I haven't found anything obvious
in the fs code... Would it be possible to add some documentation of
that, along with an explaination of what i_ino==0 is supposed to
indicate?  (Bad/invalid inode?)
TIA,
Eli
