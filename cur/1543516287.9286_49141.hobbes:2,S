It was running, as was rpc.quotad, rpc.mountd, and rpc.nfsd.  RedHat's
init scripts start these programs automatically at boot time.  I may
have some complaints about RedHat, but they generally make sure the
right stuff gets started in their rc scripts. 
And I goofed up those messages... the svc messages were supposed to be:
svc: unknown version (3)
svc: unknown program 100227 (me 100003)
I believe these are both pertaining to nfs v3 (nfsd and rpc).
