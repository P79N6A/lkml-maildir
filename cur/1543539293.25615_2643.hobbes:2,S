Or better yet, an ISA->PCI adaptor card.  Umm.. I guess that
wouldn't work since space restrictions would kill it.  It was a
good thought though.  ;o)

Er.. looks like you thought of the same thing as I.  The pitfalls
of reading a message while you respond...  ;o)

And that was a big PITA.  I'm glad it got merged in, and equally
frustrated at the ongoing "get rid of ISA" motherboard makers are
doing.  I fear when I get a new Athlon sometime this year, I will
have to follow a trickle down of upgrades.  I currently have ISA
modem, SB16, and MDA.  I have 3 ISA slots, and need them.  What
anyone would need 8 PCI's for is beyond me...  Itd be nice to use
my existing hardware in the new system..

I use MDA + Cirrus Logic GL5446 with no framebuffer. Works great.
I can't wait for the new console stuff to get finished and
hopefully merged with the kernel proper.  That would be very cool
indeed.
