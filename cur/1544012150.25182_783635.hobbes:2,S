We have:
        clocksource_tick.read = tick_ops->get_tick;
And clocksource_tick is of type clocksource:
struct clocksource {
	...
        cycle_t (*read)(void);
And cycle_t is:
/* clocksource cycle base type */
typedef u64 cycle_t;
And u64 is now:
unsigned long long - thus we need to fix prototype
of get_tick to fix the warnings.
A cast could do it - but fixing the real problem
is better here.
