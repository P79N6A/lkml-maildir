This should be driven by hid-apple/usbhid. Could you please look into 
/sys/bus/usb/devices for this device and check where does the 'driver' 
symlink point to?
Also, for this device, we force a creation of hiddev node, so it's 
possible (and, in fact, probable), that some lirc process has the node 
open and wakes it up periodically? (I think there is a macmini lirc 
userspace driver, please check whether it has the hiddev node open).
