Here is the full patch I sent to Chris the other day. That first hunk
must have gotten lost somewhere...

NFS: Fix a potential panic in O_DIRECT
Based on an original patch by Mike O'Connor and Greg Banks of SGI.
Mike states:
A normal user can panic an NFS client and cause a local DoS with
'judicious'(?) use of O_DIRECT. Any O_DIRECT write to an NFS file where the
user buffer starts with a valid mapped page and contains an unmapped page,
will crash in this way.  I haven't followed the code, but O_DIRECT reads
with similar user buffers will probably also crash albeit in different
ways.
Details:  when nfs_get_user_pages() calls get_user_pages(), it detects
and correctly handles get_user_pages() returning an error, which happens
if the first page covered by the user buffer's address range is unmapped.
However, if the first page is mapped but some subsequent page isn't,
get_user_pages() will return a positive number which is less than the
number of pages requested (this behaviour is sort of analagous to a
short write() call and appears to be intentional).  nfs_get_user_pages()
doesn't detect this and hands off the array of pages (whose last few
elements are random rubbish from the newly allocated array memory) to
it's caller, whence they go to nfs_direct_write_seg(), which then totally
ignores the nr_pages it's given, and calculates its own idea of how many
pages are in the array from the user buffer length.  Needless to say,
when it comes to transmit those uninitialised page* pointers, we see
a crash in the network stack.
