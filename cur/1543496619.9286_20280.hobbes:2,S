G'day all,
I was just have a bit of a look at the fs code, and noticed something a
little odd. There are alot of 'goto' statements in the code. From what I
can see they are not needed.
eg :
line 632 of /usr/src/linux/fs/open.c :
struct file *filp_open(const char * filename, int flags, int mode)
{
        struct inode * inode;
        struct dentry * dentry;
        struct file * f;
        int flag,error;
 
        error = -ENFILE;
        f = get_empty_filp();
        if (!f)
                goto out;
	....
	<SNIP>
out:
        return ERR_PTR(error);
}
this seems like an extra jmp statement to me (unless the compiler
optimises it)
ie why not just do this :
struct file *filp_open(const char * filename, int flags, int mode)
{
        struct inode * inode;
        struct dentry * dentry;
        struct file * f;
        int flag,error;
        error = -ENFILE;
        f = get_empty_filp();
        if (!f)
                return ERR_PTR(error);
	....
	<SNIP>
}
Cheers Mof.
