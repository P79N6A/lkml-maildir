Well, I wrote both.
The bootmem patch's benefits are not very visible (if at all) for
machines other than simulators and some unusual large systems. I
am not pressing for its inclusion in mainline for the basic reason
that what it addresses does not affect the systems I'm using anymore,
if only because the systems changed. =)
The waitqueue patch has been integrated into both mainline 2.4 and 2.5.
Cheers,
Bill
