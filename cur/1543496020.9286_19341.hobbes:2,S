I received a reply from Colin Plumb <colin@alumni.cs.colorado.edu>, that
included the following:

Since Mr. Plumb has been active in the NTP community, I accept his word
on this.
If anyone knows for certain that recent systems do synchronize the CPU
clocks, it would be useful to note that in these mailing lists, so that
future development might take advantage of it.
Since I don't have access to an MP Alpha, I can't contribute further in
this area.  I would like to thank everyone who has taken time to try to
resolve this.
