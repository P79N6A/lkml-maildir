Sure. Run any of: top, ps, lsof, fuser...

Judging by the crazy example and the observation
that an O(n*n) algorithm is involved, directory
reads on that very fast machine should get annoying
once you have a few thousand processes. They'd be
perceptable one-by-one, which adds up when you have
multiple reads due to scripts, top, or multiple
users.
Anyway, it's not just about performance! That's
only half of the problem. The other half is
reliability. The way /proc works is this:
Count tasks as you read them. The number is
your directory offset. Return a few dozen entries
at a time. For each read, you'll need to find
back your place. You do this by counting tasks
until you reach your offset. Of course, tasks
will have been created and destroyed between
reads, so who knows where you'll continue from?
That's simply not reliable.
