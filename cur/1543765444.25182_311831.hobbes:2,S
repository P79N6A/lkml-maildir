Thanks, I'll get myself onto that list...

With this array of modules:
sg                     34112  0 
sr_mod                 17700  0

ide_cd                 40004  0 
Where ide_cd was told to ignore hdc (inspired from the dvd+rw-tools 
web), I got this:

Not sure what it says, but I see one sesssion there. I guess that's 
from my previos burn attempt. I seemed to be successful with:
tippex root # dvd+rw-format -blank /dev/sr0
* DVD±RW/-RAM format utility by <appro@fy.chalmers.se>, version 4.10.
* 4.7GB DVD-RW media in Sequential mode detected.
* blanking |
No errors reported! Now I get:

Yep. I get the feeling my media and the drive as-is don't like each
other. What are the chances that the device is faulty but i can still 
blank the media (btw where can I read up on blanking vs. formating?)
