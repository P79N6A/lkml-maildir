I'm afraid I don't see the point in this.  You could use one marker
for all that data (and force the more naive tracer callbacks to ignore
out some of them).  You could even use two markers (and force the more
naive tracer to attach to only to its favorite subset).  But to use a
second, different, less efficient, not more configurable tracing hook
mechanism in the same logical spot makes no sense to me.
