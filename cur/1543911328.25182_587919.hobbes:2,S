Thanks, fair enough. Does this mean you're acking them -- I'd prefer both
the patches to be applied separately. Rationale: we should still fix the
appldata_exit() related oops _before_ removing it so that in future if
this needs to be made modular for debugging purpose again, just the
removal patch can be reverted, but the oops would still be fixed in the
commit before it.
