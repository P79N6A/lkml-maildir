What's the prupose of d_move_count?
AFAICS it protects against a double rename: first to different bucket, 
then back to original bucket. This changes the position of the dentry in 
the hash chain and a concurrent lookup would skip entries.
d_lock wouldn't prevent that.
But I think d_bucket could be removed: for __d_lookup the test appears 
to be redundant with the d_move_count test. The remaining users are not 
performance critical, they could recalculate the bucket from d_parent 
and d_name.hash.
