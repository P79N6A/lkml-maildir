Dear friends,
                              Here I am facing a little problem in writing a
device driver for linux. Actually i have to integrate a A/D card with the
system,  I want to use the DMA transfer scheme ( I am using the memory mappped
addresses of the card and linux system calls) , I am in particular not able to
use the function __get_dma_pages to allocate the memory for dma transfer.  I
have tried by includung the header file but it is giving  undefined reference, 
do i have to install some module for this .  Waiting for the reply.
ALSO I WOULD LIKE TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE MAILING LIST FOR LINUX DEVICE DRIVERS,
PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO DO THE SAME.
Thanking you,
Anand Garg.
IRPD, NewDelhi.
