Let me suggest something different. Buy a pile of cheap celerons and 100Mbit
cards. Then you can try and make your algorithms massively parallel instead

On a PPro it may help. But if you are worried about memory bandwidth a ppro
isnt a good option anyway by modern standards

We dont flush caches on task switches and we dont flush caches on cross cpu
invalidated (just the TLB is flushed in general, sometimes specific pages)

Possibly - if it will boot that way. You may well not get USB bios emulation
unless you have a card with roms on it and stuff.
