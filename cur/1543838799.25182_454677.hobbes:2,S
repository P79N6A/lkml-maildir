BTW this patch didn't add the STA_NANO bits yet, as that requires changes 
to <sys/timex.h> and a recompiled ntpd, so the values are still in usec.
It's not difficult to change/add, but one has to be a little careful about 
compatibility.

I think you refer to the PPSKit? Well, the first step to integrate it 
properly is done. Ulrich took the reference code rather unmodified, which 
has a rather strong emphasis on weird portability (one only has to look at 
l_fp.h to know what I mean), which is not really acceptable in the kernel. 
Its ioctl API probably should be converted to sysfs, so there is still 
some way to go.
bye, Roman
