AC> You need a permanent on disk device key for the system.
Correct.
AC> That basically means either a name or number in the inode.
Correct.
AC> A number is obviously somewhat easier.
Wrong. Configuration files for programs uses names (like "/dev/ttyS0" or
wahtever) anyway. So you have NO choice: you use names. Then you can translate
it to major/minor numbers and then kernel will translate major/minor number in
device address (old way) or you can translate device name straight to device
address (devfs way). Why old way is preferrable ? This is the question.
AC> major/minor is a very clean and neat idea - we might want 32bits of it sure
They are clean and neat ONLY if we agree that intermediate step
(device name->major/minor->driver address) is needed. And I can not understood
why it's needed.
