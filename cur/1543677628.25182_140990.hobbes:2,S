   EMSG_NET_LINK_UP     "%s: state change: link up, %d Mbps, %s-duplex\n"
Should indicate flow control state too.
   EMSG_NET_START_QUEUE "%s: performance event: (re)starting netdev queue\n"
   EMSG_NET_STOP_QUEUE  "%s: performance event: stopping netdev queue\n"
Oh _ABSOLUTELY NOT_, you're not printing a message
for normal events like this.  Especially those that are
going to occur on highly loaded systems.
