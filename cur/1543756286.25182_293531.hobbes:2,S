I've just spotted that if the function is arch-dependent it means that for us 
it will be subarch-dependant.
I've the doubt that the addition would better go under sys-i386 or some other 
subarch-dependent directories (in a file compiled against kernelspace 
headers, i.e. not listed in USER_OBJS in the directory it's contained 
inside), and it'd be nice to add also the x86_64 version.
