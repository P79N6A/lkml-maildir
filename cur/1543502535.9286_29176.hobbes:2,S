And how do you determine whether your DIMM is bad? I have the above
problem too - except that it only shows in X -, and I've tried running
md5sum-s several times or compiling kernel, but those showed no error.
How can one determine _if_ the lockup is caused by bad hardware, and
if it is, _which_ piece of hardware is bad?
(I have an old Trident 9680, a K6-2/300, 128M RAM, an SMC Ultra ISA
and an NE2k PCI Ethernet card, two IDE disks and an IDE cd-rom. Nearly
the same hw worked fine with a 486 dx4-100 w/64M RAM)
