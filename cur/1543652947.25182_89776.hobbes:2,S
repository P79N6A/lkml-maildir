oprofile enabled: source of NMIs, check for apic irqs gets triggered,
all is OK
oprofile disabled: oprofile disable restores the perfctr settings, so
NMI watchdog is as before, all is OK
So this patch actually allows the NMI watchdog to work when oprofile is
running, which it didn't before, which is neat.

Can you send me the test module so I don't have to bother writing one
myself ?
I'll try to test this weekend
