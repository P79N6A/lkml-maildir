That's slightly different from what I am experiencing on s390x. Here,
I get a panic 'length error' after initramfs is unzipped. It always
seems like one byte less is counted than actually is inside the
archive.
OTOH, the result of a stack overflow is usually undefined, so it might
also be this problem.
