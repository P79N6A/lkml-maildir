Link to earlier discussion below
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=112317327529855&w=2
I had suggested that we remove it completely in our discussion but i didnt
hear anything from you after that, so i thought that was acceptable.
You had suggested in that discussion that it would be better to add an 
option for startup. Iam opposed to adding any option, when we certainly know 
there are no users. Earlier based on your suggestion i added a startup
option to choose ipi broadcast mode, which you promptly removed when you
put physflat changes. I think its better to not add any option without
real need. Do you agree?
Please reply if you want me to remove the !HOTPLUG case which is my 
preference as well, and maybe while the memory is fresh, we can stick
with it this time when we are in the same page :-(
