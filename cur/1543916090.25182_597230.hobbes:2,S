 Hmm, it sounds a bit hackish to me.  The serial part is from the 1970s -- 
nobody thought of power management back then.  And even though the 
DECstation is about 20 years younger, it does not provide any means for 
power management either -- it is a workstation/server class system after 
all.

 Hmm, nothing of relevance there.
 I see no problem with implementing the ->pm() call as something like:
void zs_pm(struct uart_port uport, unsigned int state, unsigned int oldstate)
{
	struct zs_port *zport = to_zport(uport);
	if (state < 3)
		zport->regs[5] |= TxENAB;
	else
		zport->regs[5] &= ~TxENAB;
	write_zsreg(zport, R5, zport->regs[5]);
}
itself, but it looks more like a workaround than a fix to me.  I'll have 
to think about it and also double-check it is safe.  The SCC is about as 
complicated as you can get with a serial port.
 Thanks for the hint though.
