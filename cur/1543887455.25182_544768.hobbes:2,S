For all Debian sysvinit issues, please send email to
pkg-sysvinit-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org (added to CC).
For the Debian sysvinit crew: Guys, have a look at
http://linux-ata.org/shutdown.html.
  We need to act on it, and also file a
bug on all of our current kernels (poweroff causes minor but accumulating-
over-time damage to all hardware under control of libata).  This is really
something we should be trying to fix on our 2.6.18 kernels and stable
sysvinit.

Tejun, am I right to assume that any servers with self-contained SCSI disks
(i.e. that are not plugged into externally powered drive enclosures, etc)
also get the emergency head unloads when they are powered off?
