Hi,
I have an ATAPI 36X CDROM:
cafe:bash# hdparm -i /dev/hdc
/dev/hdc:
 HDIO_GET_MULTCOUNT failed: Invalid argument
 Model=36X CD-ROM, FwRev=VER 2.F0, SerialNo=MT1102 F
 Config={ Fixed Removeable DTR<=5Mbs DTR>10Mbs nonMagnetic }
 RawCHS=0/0/0, TrkSize=0, SectSize=0, ECCbytes=0
 BuffType=0(?), BuffSize=0kB, MaxMultSect=0
 DblWordIO=no, maxPIO=4(?), DMA=yes, maxDMA=2(fast)
 (maybe): CurCHS=0/0/0, CurSects=0, LBA=yes, LBAsects=0
 tDMA={min:120,rec:150}, DMA modes: *mword0 mword1 mword2 
 IORDY=yes, tPIO={min:227,w/IORDY:120}, PIO modes: mode3 mode4 
and ide controller is the ALI 15X3
cafe:bash# lspci

01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: 3Dfx Interactive, Inc. Voodoo Banshee (rev 03)
Using Andres ide.2.2.14.20000108.patch, the cdrom does not work and the
system responds with device not configured.  Using 2.2.14 and an ide patch
I merged up from the ide.2.2.14-13.19991213.patch.bz2 the CDROM works fine.
The version that works, uses the alim15x3.c Version 0.06.  I'm attaching my
.config (used for both builds) and the patch which works is available at
http://www.affinity-systems.ab.ca/staff/jbourne/ide.2.2.14.20000106.patch.bz2
(linked from the page under /staff/jbourne/)
The ide-cd and cdrom modules are from the newer kernel so this rules them
out (they load and work fine with the older kernel and patch).
Thanks for any info.
Regards,
Jim
