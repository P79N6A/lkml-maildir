Subject: [patch 0/5] object debugging infrastructure V2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

This is version 2 of the object debugging infrastructure. Changes
versus V1:
- review comments processed:
  - multiplexing interfaces replaced
  - object type is determined by a caller provided pointer to 
    a debug structure which replaces the object type identifier
    -> No changes to the core code for new users
  - new debug state "destroyed" (kobject wishlist)
  - various cleanups
- complete detachment of the tracker object from the real object
  (no change to the real objects data structure necessary anymore)
- improved robustness (object memory management, oom cleanup)
- full set of self tests
- debugfs statistics 
- docbook documentation
Thanks,
	tglx
