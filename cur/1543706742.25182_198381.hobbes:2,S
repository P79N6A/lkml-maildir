I think the main concern now is over the testing of paths.  Sending an
io down an inactive path can be very expensive for some hardware
configurations.  So I'm considering changing a couple of things:
- Only ever send io to 1 priority group at a time (even test ios).
  To test the lower priority groups we'd have to periodically switch to
  them and use them for a bit for both test io and proper io.
- For some hardware there are better ways of testing the path than
  sending the test io.  Should the drivers expose a test function ?
  In the absence of this we'd fallback to the test io method.
The other thing we need is to try and get the drivers to deferentiate
between a media error and a path error, so that media errors get
reported up quickly and don't cause false path failures.  This is
possibly an area that you could help with ?
