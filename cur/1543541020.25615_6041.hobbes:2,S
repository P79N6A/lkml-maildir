Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi all,
Here's a small patch which gets rid of a FIXME comment in the
kernel/fork.c file. Instead of doing a memcpy, it copies each field
individually. I hope I got all of the fields which were supposed to be
in there.
Why do it this way? C allows structures to be packed with extra bytes so
simply calculating how much space all the elements *should* take, it's
better to either copy them individually or the whole structure at one
time (doing a sizeof(struct foo) for instance).
Comments?
