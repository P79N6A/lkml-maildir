In the 2.3.29 source file linux/arch/i386/boot/setup.S there's code like below :
# Move rest of setup code/data to here
---> movw $4096, %di   # four sectors loaded by LILO  <---
 subw %si, %si
 movw %cs, %ax   # aka SETUPSEG
 movw %ax, %es
 movw $SYSSEG, %ax
 movw %ax, %ds
 rep
 movsw
I wonder why there's the movw $4096, %di instead of movw $2048, %di (2048 == 4 x 512) ?
