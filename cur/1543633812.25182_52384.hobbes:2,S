Um, so you want to kill the database server?  Think carefully 
about making automatic selections like that.  Wouldn't it be 
much better to just tell a process that makes a memory request 
that won't fit that it can't have it?  The process can then 
decide on it's own if it is capable of continuing or aborting.
The real solution lies in getting rid of over subscription and 
properly returning NULL for memory allocations when RAM+SWAP 
has run out.  To me this is a kernel memory subsystem issue.  
When the X font server requested that huge block of memory it 
should have been told you can't have it as there is no way it 
would fit within RAM+SWAP-other processes.  No need to kill a 
process.
