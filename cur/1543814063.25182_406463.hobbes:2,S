Please do tell me how one is supposed to do sco communications when
this value is chosen on purpose and I'll be happy to implement that.
I have found no clue about that in the bluetooth specs.
Meanwhile, I'll implement it with a quirk, and I can guarantee that
you're not going to like the result.  I have a list of 104 (iirc)
device ids that may need it, and given that hardware is supposed to
work they will have to be added until proven otherwise.
And it won't fix the uart versions either.
  OG.
