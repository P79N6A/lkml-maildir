it deals with ip options (see rfc's 791 and 1122).  
ip_options_build is called while putting together the headers, but
prior to checksumming from numerous places in net/ipv4/ip_output.c.  
ip_options_fragment does special handling for options in fragmented
datagrams (again, ip_output.c).
ip_options_echo is used to setup the options used in a reply; see
net/ipv4/icmp.c et al.
ip_options_compile and ip_options_get both seem to be used to extract raw
options from an skb.
ip_options_forward handles setting up source-routed packets, while 
ip_options_rcv_srr handles their receipt.
i am by not any mean at all an authority on these matters, so take this with
a grain of salt :).
