Subject: [36/41] 64k block size support for Ext2/3/4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The next 4 patches support large block size (up to PAGESIZE, max 64KB)
for ext2/3/4, originally from Takashi Sato.
http://marc.info/?l=linux-ext4&m=115768873518400&w=2
It's quite simple to support large block size in ext2/3/4, mostly just
enlarge the block size limit.  But it is NOT possible to have 64kB
blocksize on ext2/3/4 without some changes to the directory handling
code.  The reason is that an empty 64kB directory block would have a
rec_len == (__u16)2^16 == 0, and this would cause an error to be hit in
the filesystem.  The proposed solution is to put 2 empty records in such
a directory, or to special-case an impossible value like rec_len =
0xffff to handle this.
The Patch-set consists of the following 4 patches.
  [1/4]  ext2/3/4: enlarge blocksize
         - Allow blocksize up to pagesize
  [2/4]  ext2: fix rec_len overflow
         - prevent rec_len from overflow with 64KB blocksize
  [3/4]  ext3: fix rec_len overflow
         - prevent rec_len from overflow with 64KB blocksize
  [4/4]  ext4: fix rec_len overflow
         - prevent rec_len from overflow with 64KB blocksize
Just rebase to 2.6.23-rc4 and against the ext4 patch queue. Compile tested only.
Next steps:
Need a e2fsprogs changes to able test this feature. As mkfs needs to be
educated not assuming rec_len to be blocksize all the time.
Will try it with Christoph Lameter's large block patch next.
