How about CHECK_PAGE_FLAGS_CLEAR_AT_FREE?

If you like the suggestion above, then for this one
how about CHECK_PAGE_FLAGS_CLEAR_AT_ALLOC?
I just haven't changed those names in the patch, continued to
use the names from before: they're probably not the names I'd

The one I really disliked was "PAGE_FLAGS" for an obscure
subset of page flags, and have got rid of that.

That's exactly what I did, isn't it?
