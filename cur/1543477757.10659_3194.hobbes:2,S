Agreed. Sounds much more professional and press release-like. You
might even want to make it more marketing-ish, though -- hype the
wondrous things Linux 2.2 will allow users to do.
Also, I'm happy that it doesn't use the words "GNU/Linux". internal
politics aside, all that would do in a mainstream press release is
confuse people, and we _don't_ want that. remember, there are a lot of 
people out there who have heard of Linux but have no idea what GNU
is. while that's arguably a bad thing, a press release is not an
appropriate place to try and change that.
