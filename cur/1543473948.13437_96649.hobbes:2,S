Subject: Cannot mount vfat partitions with 2.2.0pre3

Just built and booted 2.2.0pre3. Unfortunately it cannot mount my
Win95 partition:
[root@mothra /root]# mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /dos/
fat_read_super: Bad fsinfo_offset
VFS: Can't find a valid MSDOS filesystem on dev 08:01.
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sda1,
       or too many mounted file systems
Regards,
Damien Miller
