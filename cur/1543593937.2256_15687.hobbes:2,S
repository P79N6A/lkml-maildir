Well, first, I have to ask, why??
First, if you need to deal with little endian data, on a PPC stwbrx &
lwbrx are your friends.
With the possible exception of the matrox guy, I haven't heard of ANYONE 
running in LE mode on ppc. The second problem is going to be to recompile 
ALL the applications you want and hope they work.
Finally, if you're doing anything that connects to the internet, remember 
that network byte order is big-endian. You might find it interesting that 
even Intel is now re-discovering the usefullness of big-endian in some of 
their strongarm/Xscale processors.
