Can we have an end to the distribution plugs on the l-k list please? I
have seen enough of the endless mails about your wonderful revolutionary
distribution to realize that you are simply going to take every
opportunity that you can to espouse about it in long emails that say
nothing.  Try a distribution advocacy group please, this is not the
place.
Thank you kindly...
