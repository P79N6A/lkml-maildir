several reasons
1) this thread keeps coming back on linux-kernel and various linux
   related usenet groups every couple of months or so.  the people who
   ask are either slow learners or incapable of using dejanews.
2) someone always suggests putting in C++ but never wants to do the
   work to do it themselves.  if they are so gung ho about the idea,
   they are free to fork off a variant kernel path.

it's also trivial to write very bad code in C++ since the compiler
will try to do a lot of stuff behind the scenes.

how many of these are out there?  seriously, if you want to share
driver code between windows and linux i see no reason not to write the
whole thing in plain C in the first place.

please, be my guest.  no one is stopping you in this effort.

no, why don't *you* start doing them.
