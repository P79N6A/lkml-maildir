I'm not seeing the path on the freeing side that silently accepts BADPTR.
It is not ok to derefence BADPTR, but it's obviously ok to _free_ it.
Also, if I read the patch correctly, you _also_ return BADPTR for slabs 
that are too large. No?  That would be wrong - those need to return NULL 
for "out of memory".
(But I only looked at the diff, not at the end result, so it may be that 
all the cases where you changed "return NULL" into "return BADPTR" were 
really just the size-zero ones - it just looked suspicious).
