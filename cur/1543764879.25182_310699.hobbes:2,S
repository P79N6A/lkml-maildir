Could you explain a little more?  I don't see the point in denying
access to root, but I also can't tell from your explanation whether you
do or not.
If I mount a filesystem using ssh, I want to be able to "sudo cp
foo.txt /etc" and not get an inexplicable permissions error.
I don't really see the point of this restriction, anyway.  Could you
explain why this shouldn't be a matter of policy, and kept out of the
kernel?  Have the userspace file servers default to putting restrictive
permissions on mounts unless requested otherwise.
I can think of plenty of uses for this.
