Hi Tomasz. I can't tell; The combined kernel+initramfs is bigger than the 8Mb 
silo allocates for the kernel, and it does this:
	boot: chunky
	Allocated 8 Megs of memory at 0x40000000 for kernel
	/
	Fatal error: Image too large to fit in destination
	
	Fatal error: Image too large to fit in destination
	
	Error loading /boot/chunky
	
	Image not found.... try again
I don't see any silo config options to increase this value in the docs.
Good idea though :)
