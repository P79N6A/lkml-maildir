The abort code check of cmd->serial_number is the only thing I can see
that needs care and that looks safe by the time we hit eh_abort because
the mid level has quiesced the request queue.
eh_reset is whacking on requests but they are the IDE layer requests so
I suspect you want to simply drop the scsi locks for the eh functions
much earlier and use spin_lock_irqsave/restore on the ide lock ?
