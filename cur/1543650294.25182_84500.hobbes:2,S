HI,folks
I am reading the source code about tty(tty_io.c,n_tty.c,tty_ioctl.c etc)to implement some virtual tty which link to the UART through complex protocol .
My problem:
I know /dev/tty is the current terminal,
and /dev/ttySX is serial port,
but what is /dev/tty0,/dev/ttyX,/dev/console,/dev/cuaX,/dev/cuaX?
I got confused with these.
what is /dev/ptmx?what is ptm/pts? what is the device which's major device number is 128-135 and 136-143,what is the relationship among them?
I am sorry about my poor Englist and maybe foolish question,but I really need help.
TIA
BTW:can somebody show me any link to Mailing list/News group/Forum which about tty?
