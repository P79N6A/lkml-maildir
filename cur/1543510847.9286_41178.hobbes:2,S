We are in the process of putting a very large database online hopefuly
using a linux cluster attached to a multi-host stand-alone RAID controller
(CMD 5500 - www.cmd.com).
I couldn't find any specific references, but how well does linux handle
logical drive sizes of, say, 750GB or higher?  We could break the RAID 5
array up into smaller chunks, but for ease-of-management it seems easier
to just make one huge drive (i dunno, maybe there's performance reasons
not to).
Thoughts?
