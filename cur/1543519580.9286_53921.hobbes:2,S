	If this is the way the headers are heading ?  Who is going to
	maintain the 'which kernel headers should I be using(*)' list ?
	I see an easy way of automating the process ,  But I sure as heck
	am not going to update my headers without at least compiling the
	the kernel & booting it & testing & recompile a few tools that
	are dependant on them & testing & ...  ,  Please can we find an
	decent way around this dilemma ?  Tia,  JimL
