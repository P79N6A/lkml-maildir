The old JFS code base had something similar before it got ported
to Linux (I believe it came from OS/2). But it was removed.
And miguel did a prototype of it with ext2 at some point long ago.
But to me it's unclear it's a really good idea. Having at least the option
to control where physical storage is placed is nice, especially 
if you cannot mirror everything (ZFS seems to assume everything is mirrored)
And separate devices and LVM make that easier.
