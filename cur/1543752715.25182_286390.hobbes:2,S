This isn't a "quick exit", though.  It is just a termination check in
case dnotify was disabled on boot.  The rest of dnotify_parent() is
always executed and it does the equivalent of dget_parent().
So why is inotify showing up on your test and not dnotify?
Hm, dnotify always grabs the lock but does not bump dentry->count unless
there is actually a watch on the dentry.  Could that really be the
difference and cause of the slowdown?  We could probably do that, too.

Unfortunately, no.  There is no relationship between the parent and the
child inode's inotify_data structure.  The best we can do is exactly
what dnotify does, actually, which is
	spin_lock(&dentry->d_lock);
	parent = dentry->d_parent;
	if (parent->d_inode->i_dnotify_mask & event) {
		dget(parent);
		spin_unlock(&dentry->d_lock);
		__inode_dir_notify(parent->d_inode, event);
		dput(parent);
	} else {
		spin_unlock(&dentry->d_lock);
	}
Instead of our current "explicit"
	parent = dget_parent(dentry);
	inotify_inode_queue_event(parent->d_inode, mask, cookie,
				  filename);
	dput(parent);
E.g., save the ref unless absolutely needed.
I am open to other ideas, too, but I don't see any nice shortcuts like
what we can do in inotify_inode_queue_event().
(Other) John?  Any ideas?
Best,
