We already have such a flag in the zone structure
        /* A count of how many reclaimers are scanning this zone */
        atomic_t                reclaim_in_progress;
The problem is that the LRU lock etc is also taken outside of reclaim. In 
order for the flag to work we would have to set it everywhere the lru lock 
etcis taken.
