Fair enough.

OK

This seems reasonable, and it doesn't preclude the ability of a
library interface having a u_int64_t interface either. I think once
we support large files for other API like stat it should make
application code much cleaner.
I really like the idea of being able to so something like:
    u_int64_t	offset;
    f = open("really/bin/file",O_RDRW);
    fstat64(f,&st);			/* probably doesn't need new syscall */
    [...]
    offset = 3ul*(1024*1024*1024);	/* 3GB offset */
    
    ptr = mmap64(NULL,small_size,PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,MAP_SHARED,f,offset);
    /* ptr now maps to 3GB offset into file... */
