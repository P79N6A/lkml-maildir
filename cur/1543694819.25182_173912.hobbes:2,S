Hi,
Please CC me in on reply as I do not subscribe to list.
I am getting the following errors on an Intel Dual 1.8Ghz Zeon box with
1gb RAM.  Dual Seagate Cheetah U320 (ST336607LC) in software raid 1 on
an Adaptec 7902W controller.  Kernel version 2.4.20-20.9smp

Server was rebooted at this point after syslog failure and general
service stability problems.  What-no-mail etc.
The server started up and gave file system errors - you would think bad
hardware here but of course when fsck was run in maintenance mode
everything came back fine.  Rebooted and it came up and ran just great
apart from this single message (see below).  Server has now been up for
20 minutes and is v.busy delivering mail but working just fine.

I am out researching driver / firmware issues with the hard drives and
controllers as I googled some links on various searches that might be
relevant. My question is this.  Is there any known issues in the kernel
version that I am using 2.4.20-20.9smp that may impact what I am seeing
here?  Any other comments, suggestions, toilet humor etc. welcomed.
Again I am not subscribed to this list please CC me in on the reply.
Regards and thanks!
