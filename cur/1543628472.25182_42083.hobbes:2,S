Hi all,
2.2.20 with Andre's IDE patches, running on Debian 2.2.
Apr 23 14:53:51 cadmium kernel: hda: timeout waiting for DMA
Apr 23 14:53:51 cadmium kernel: hda: ide_dma_timeout: Lets do it again!stat
= 0x58, dma_stat = 0x20
Apr 23 14:53:51 cadmium kernel: hda: DMA disabled
Apr 23 14:53:51 cadmium kernel: hda: irq timeout: status=0x80 { Busy }
Apr 23 14:53:51 cadmium kernel: hda: DMA disabled
Apr 23 14:53:51 cadmium kernel: hda: ide_set_handler: handler not null;
old=c0197f84, new=c0197f84
Apr 23 14:53:51 cadmium kernel: bug: kernel timer added twice at c0197df1.
Apr 23 14:53:51 cadmium kernel: ide0: reset: success
This is the poor man's SMP, a dual Celeron 466 with an Abit BP6 motherboard
- the motherboard not being the most stable on earth. However, the notice
above might still help the quality of the IDE driver. Maxtor 5T030H3.
(Oh, I'm aware of the fact that running the IDE patch is my own
responsibility, i.e. might break things, burn house, steal car).
Feel free to ask additional information.
Best regards,
Valentijn
