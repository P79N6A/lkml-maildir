i think worker threads (or any 'helper' threads) should be avoided. It can
be done without any extra process context, and it should be done that way.
Why all the trouble with async IO requests if requests are going to end up
in a worker thread's context anyway? (which will be a serializing point,
otherwise why does it end up there?)
