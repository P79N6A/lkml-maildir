There's no dentry for the "/"? I mean the rootfs.

Why we need such a vfsmount (for the "/", not the rootfs)? And where
we store the mount point info (path) when mount_root, s_root and the
mnt_mountpoint are all points to the "/" which is allocated by
d_alloc_root? Or do we have to store such info? Why?
