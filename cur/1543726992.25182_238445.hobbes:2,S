Instead of architecting a generic interface, might you simply exclude
access from your driver to things that already have generic interfaces? 
I think there are things that we exclude from /proc/device-tree on ppc64
because there's a generic equivalent elsewhere.

There are certainly some very platform-specific things that obviously
need to be done with direct access to the firmware, and that we don't
want to pollute the kernel with.  Parsing some of the firmware error
logs on ppc64 comes to mind.  You just need to be *very* careful with
the application authors because it's such a big gun :)
