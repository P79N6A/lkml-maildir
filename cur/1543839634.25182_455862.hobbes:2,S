Unfortunately the NPTL documentation is FAR from complete - there are no
man pages at all, and some featured are completely undocumented.  For
example process-shared mutexes are supported, but the only way you'd
know is to look at the source.  The only docs I could find on how to use
them were old Solaris man pages.
