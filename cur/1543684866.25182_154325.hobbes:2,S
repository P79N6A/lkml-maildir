Clusters have captive, no, _desperate_ customers ;-) And it
seems that people are just as happy putting MPI as their
transport on top of all those link-layer technologies.

That's one of the few things ATM's AAL5 got right. But in the end,
I think it doesn't really matter. At 1 Gbps, an MTU-sized packet
flies by within 13 us. At 10 Gbps, it's only 1.3 us. At that point,
you may well treat it as an atomic unit.

And it's about time for that :-)
