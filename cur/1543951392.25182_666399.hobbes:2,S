Where "interesting tick" means "tick in which a process timer has
expired," correct?

And my changes introduce these clocks as separate fields in the signal
struct, updated at the tick.

Okay, I hadn't been clear on the distinction between process-wide and
thread-only timers.  So, really, run_posix_cpu_timers() needs to check
both sets, the versions in the signal struct for the process-wide timers
and the versions in the task struct for the thread-only timers.

I'm going to table this for now.  Based on my preliminary performance
results, the changes I've made mean that using a workqueue or softirq is
not necessary.  In the profiles of a couple of testcases I've run,
run_posix_cpu_timers() didn't show up at all, whereas before my change
it was right at the top with ~35% of the time.
I'll hang on to your notes, though, for future reference.

So, check_process_timers() checks for and handles any expired timers for
the currently-running process, whereas check_thread_timers() checks for
and handles any expired timers for the currently-running thread.  Is
that correct?
And, since these timers are only counting CPU time, if a thread is never
running at the tick (since that's how we account time in the first
place) any timers it might have will never expire.  Sorry to repeat the
obvious but sometimes it's better to state things very explicitly.
At each tick a process-wide timer may have expired.  Also, at each tick
a thread-only timer may have expired.  Or, of course, both.  So we need
to detect both events and fire the appropriate timer in the appropriate
context.
I think my current code (i.e. the patch I published for comment a few
days ago) does this, with one exception:  If a thread-only timer expires
it _won't_ be detected when run_posix_cpu_timers() runs, since I'm only
checking the process-wide timers.  This implies that I need to do twice
as many checks up front.  I'll think about how to minimize that, though.

I've actually gotten a little bit of insight into this.  I don't think
that a straight set of shared fields is sufficient except in UP (and
possibly dual-CPU) environments.  I was able to run a reasonable test on
both a four-core Opteron system and a sixteen-core Opteron system.
(That's two dual-core CPUs and four four-core CPUs, no sixteen-core
Opteron chips here. :-)  They had 1024K and 512K cache respectively.  I
didn't have a chance to actually time the runs but I observed that the
sixteen-core run took substantially longer than the four-core run.
Something like double the time.  While some part of this is likely
attributable to the smaller cache, the testcase was small enough that
that shouldn't have been a real issue.  I'm pretty confident that it was
cache conflict among the sixteen cores that did the damage.

I'm currently working on an implementation that uses the alloc_percpu()
mechanism and a separate structure.  I'm encapsulating access to the
fields in shared_xxx_sum() inline functions, which could have different
implementations for UP, dual-CPU and generic SMP kernels.  Each tick
does something like, for example:
	if (p->signal->shared_times) { /* Set if timer running. */
		cpu = get_cpu();
		shared_times = per_cpu_ptr(p->signal->shared_times, cpu);
		shared_times->shared_stime = cputime_add(shared_times->shared_stime, cputime);
		put_cpu_no_resched();
	}
(Where "shared_times" is the structure encapsulating the shared fields.)
This adds overhead to sum the per-CPU values but means that multiple
CPUs updating at the same tick won't be competing for the cache line and
killing performance.

I'll keep this in mind.

I personally think that the most promising approach is the one outlined
above (without considering the context-switch scheme for the moment).
It saves as much space as possible, doesn't penalize processes that
aren't using the posix timers and avoids cache contention between CPUs.
I'll go ahead and implement it and try to generate some numbers.
