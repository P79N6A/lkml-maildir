I would love to test this patch, but I really dont want it touching my other
ext2 file systems (like /).  I assume it would be possible to copy the ext2
code over to something like linux/fs/extnew, patch that, and then mount my
scratch partitions as extnew.  I can try an cook something like this up, but
I thought you might already have it, so I am posting here to see.
Thanks,
Jim
