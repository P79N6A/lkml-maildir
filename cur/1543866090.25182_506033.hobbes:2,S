Added ia64 list to CC.
I know ia64 kernel did what you say in old days (I know RHEL4/2.6.9 kernel does it).
Someone changed it and created cpu-only-node for some purpose, I don't know why.

In this case, MPOL_MBIND, the user requests to allocate memory from specified nodes.
I think it's better to tell him "you can't do that" than silently allocating memory
from other places.
