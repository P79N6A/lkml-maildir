Hi Ingo.
A few comments based on the git tree pulled as of
~11:00.
We have following header files in the core part:
linux/kgdb.h
asm-generic/kgdb.h
I would expect linux/kgdb.h to contain all the common definitions
needed by an arch.
And asm-generic/kgdb.h to list everything that the arch needs to
provide to support kgdb. + anything that rely on the arch
definitions provided by the arch.
Yet linux/kgdb.h says:
+/*
+ * Functions each KGDB-supporting architecture must provide:
+ */
So I am obviously wrong here. What triggered the division
in the two header files?
Some minor specific comments:
+/**
+ *	kgdb_skipexception - Bail of of KGDB when we've been triggered.
+ *	@exception: Exception vector number
+ *	@regs: Current &struct pt_regs.
+ *
+ *	On some architectures we need to skip a breakpoint exception when
+ *	it occurs after a breakpoint has been removed.
+ */
+int kgdb_skipexception(int exception, struct pt_regs *regs);
+
+/**
+ *	kgdb_post_master_code - Save error vector/code numbers.
+ *	@regs: Original pt_regs.
+ *	@e_vector: Original error vector.
+ *	@err_code: Original error code.
+ *
+ *	This is needed on architectures which support SMP and KGDB.
+ *	This function is called after all the slave cpus have been put
+ *	to a know spin state and the master CPU has control over KGDB.
+ */
+extern void kgdb_post_master_code(struct pt_regs *regs, int e_vector,
+				  int err_code);
+
Please be consistent in use of extern.
Either drop it all over or use it all over.
+#ifndef _KGDB_H_
+#define _KGDB_H_

+#include <asm/atomic.h>

+#ifdef CONFIG_KGDB
+
+#include <linux/serial_8250.h>
+#include <linux/linkage.h>
+#include <linux/init.h>
+
+#include <asm/kgdb.h>
I do not really see the point of the CONFIG_KGDB ifdef.
And if we want it then why not above the inclusion
of atomic.h?
Looking a bit closer it looks like all content from asm-generic/kgdb.h
is included in linux/kgdb.h - correct?
I assume the header file in asm-generic should have been deleted?

Make return value visible on same line as the function to be consistent in
style.

I searched but I could not find any places this

Please add:
config HAVE_ARCH_KGDB
	bool
So we later in x86/Kconfig can do:
config X86
	select HAVE_ARCH_KGDB
And we can get rid of (from x86/Kconfig):
+config HAVE_ARCH_KGDB
+	def_bool y
Back to Kconfig.kgdb:
+config KGDBOC
+	tristate "KGDB: use kgdb over the serial console"
+	depends on KGDB
Can we have a more descriptive name here.
For example:
config KGDB_SERIAL_CONSOLE
It is only used in one place so there is no
specific need for such a magic short name.
I see that all my other comments were addresses - thanks.
