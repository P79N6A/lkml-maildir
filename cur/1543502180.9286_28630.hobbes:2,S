hello all , 
I am wondering if anyone could please help me. 
i am trying to compile 2.2.9 with the kerneli patch. 
In fact i need cipe running. I would like to have the kernel module built in
( not loadable) .
there seems to be very little documentation on it, adn i am not quite sure
how it works. the parts which i dont understand is : 
once in kernel how does it appear ( cipcb cip3b ??) 
do i need to compile the user level daemon ( ciped separately ) 
are there any special options ? 
any information would be much appreciated. 
cheers,
