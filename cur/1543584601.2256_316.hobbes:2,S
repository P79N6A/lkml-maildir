You shouldn't be able to compile both usb-uhci and uhci into the kernel,
unless you tweak your .config file by hand.

What is the oops from when things crash?
Have you tried enabling debugging on the usb-serial drivers and looking
at what the visor driver spits out to the kernel debug log?  I'd be
interested in seeing that.
Since you are reporting problems with a clean 2.4.2 kernel, I don't
think that the 1 line patch in ac12 is the cause of your problem.
What kind of hardware is this?  What compiler?  What version of
modutils?  What is your .config?  Do you have any other USB devices that
work properly (or not) in this system?  Have you tried resetting your
Visor?

I've considered it, but I keep hoping that JE is going to fix the uhci
driver some day soon :)
There are other drivers that also do not work with the uhci.o driver do
to this bug.
thanks,
