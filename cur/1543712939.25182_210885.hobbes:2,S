the point is that you want this counter to increase in every cpu quick,
that's why I was thinking at posting the tasklet, if the counter doesn't
increase from softirq, you fallback in the grace period length of the
non-bh rcu.
maybe the softirq load is so high in all cpus that just the additional
counter will fix it w/o having to post any additional tasklet (I very
much hope so but especially with irq binding I don't see it happening,
however with irq binding you may have a call_rcu_bh_cpuset).  You should
give it a try and see if it just works.
