Hi,
Linux 2.2.0-pre4 has problems with my motherboard recognizing the
correct PCI configuration.
In pcibios_fixup_peer_brigdes it gives a lot of messages
PCI: Discovered primary peer bus xx
with xx ranging from e9 to ff (that's what I can see on screen after
forcing a panic to stop output) and from pcibios_sort comes a lot of
lines saying
PCI: BIOS reporting unknown device 00:xx
PCI: Device ff:xx not found by BIOS
with xx ranging from 68 to 90 in steps of 8 (again, that's what I see
on the screen).
I am quite sure that the board has only one PCI bus. Later in the
startup sequence, Linux detects at least 3 SCSI host adapters (Adaptec
2940) and hangs when setting up the "third". I am very sure there is
only one adapter.
The problem occurs in 2.1.125, 2.1.130 to 132 and all the 2.2.0-pre
upto pre4. 2.0.36 works fine, I did not try any 2.1.x before 125 yet.
My board is a UM8810P AIO V2.0 11-16-94 with a 486DX/2 processor,
Phoenix BIOS version 4.04.
The content of /proc/pci from 2.0.36 follows:
---

All devices are really there.
Hopefully we can fix that problem until 2.2.0 comes out.
