Yes.. the VM is being tuned.  The latest changes result in overly
agressive caching with some work loads.
For people who are running into this, please edit mm/vmscan.c and
change DEF_PRIORITY from 6 to 2.  This change helps the performance
woes I see on my box quite a bit.  Report results to me (interested),
and the cc list (those who can ACT on it;) unless they say otherwise.
