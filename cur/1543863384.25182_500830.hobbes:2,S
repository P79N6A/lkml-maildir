Why do you think it is not enough?  I think that any locking is not
needed.
My design principle is that the core dump routine is controlled by
the bitmask which was assigned to the dumping process at the time of
starting core dump. So if a coremask setting is changed while
core dumping, the change doesn't affect current dumping process.
This can be implemented as follows:
   core_dump_start:
  unsigned int mask = current->mm->coremask;
  for each VMA {
    write a header which depends on the result of maydump(vma, mask)
  }
  for each VMA {
    write a body which depends on the result of maydump(vma, mask)
  }
NOTE:
  maydump() is the central function, which decides whether a given
  VMA should be dumped or not.
What do you think about this?
Best regards,
