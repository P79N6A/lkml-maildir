I've discovered sme additional info on this problem. It seems to be related
to probing; if I specify "hdc=noprobe hdc=cdrom" in my append statement in
LILO, the CD-ROM mounts fine.
I tried to pin down the problem (I think it's in ide-probe.c), but I can't
find the exact thing that breaks it. In probe_for_drive(), do_probe() is
called twice for CDROMs, the first time as a hard drive, and the second as a
ATAPI device. I confirmed with some debugging code that the (failed)
do_probe(WIN_IDENTIFY) does not break the drive, but the
do_probe(WIN_PIDENTIFY) does kill it.
Does anyone with more experience in this area have any ideas? Thanks in
advance..
