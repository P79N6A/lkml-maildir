What are you smoking?
The DNS requests are happening against his express wishes, so if anything,  
the *requests* are computer misuse. Alan's NS entries pointing people  
there definitely are.
It's not Ronald who's telling people his server is authoritative; in fact,  
he's doing just the opposite, loudly.

How about starting a true free project, with charter and/or licensing that  
makes it impossible to go non-free? Something that's controlled by more  
than one person, and which is explicit about what exactly the rules are,  
and which part of those rules are responsible for particular entry.
