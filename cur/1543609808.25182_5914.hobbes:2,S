How do i get the kernel messages to stop interupting my scripting? 
( YeS im editing as root .. because the files i edit are in roots
directory and are often executables.. yes i know thats bad)
I want to divert them all to the console tty1 ( why is the first console
tty1 and not tty0? )... or just not interrupt a vi session by not
posting to the screen when i am editing ?
Maybe there is a curses vi clone editor that can give me this?
Regardless is there a way to post the messages to the console tty1 ..
without having to resort to the lilo prompt .. and telling it
console=??..
also how do i log to multiple consoles .. or send only certain types of
messages .. based on the user/author of the message or content of the
message to different ttys?
Its late.. i should know this ... help
Thanks bunches in advance
Madhav
