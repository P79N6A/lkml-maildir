   (1) You need to use (read|write)[bwl] instead of just dereferencing
       a pointer to any PCI memory region.
   (2) If the memory region is marked as non-prefetchable, readb/writeb
       should generate byte transactions. If it isn't marked as such,
       the device is broken.
				Have a nice fortnight
