Actually, I think you misunderstand the way the API works.  The only
time the dma_map_ functions pay attention to the mask is in an IOMMU
transaction.  For no-IOMMU systems, its far more efficient for bouncing
to occur in the upper layers (as it does for block and net).

This statement is incorrect, Russell has already given you a counter
example.
