Ok, that's reasonable, we don't want to end up with zillions of
ARCH_HAS_THIS and ARCH_HAS_THAT.
But then, what _is_ the problem with your approach above? An arch that
wants (and implements) hard_irq_disable will also #define that dummy
macro, so we just need to pull in the appropriate header (directly,
indirectly, anyhow -- we don't really care) into
include/linux/interrupt.h and then just do the exact same "#ifndef
hard_irq_disable" check that you're doing right now. I must be missing
something trivial (either that or I need to go and have a coffee :-)
because I don't see the possibility of hitting multiple _different_
definitions with the approach you mentioned just now.
