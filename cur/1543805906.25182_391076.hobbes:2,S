Then fix ssh, not the kernel. As I said before, this is a problem that
has been solved entirely in userspace by means of proxy certificates:
they allow the user to issue time-limited certificates that are signed
by the original certificate (hence can be authenticated as such), and
that authorise a service to do a specific thing.
