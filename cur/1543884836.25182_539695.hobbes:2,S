Subject: [PATCH] input: fix aux port detection with some i8042 chips
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Roland Scheidegger <sroland@tungstengraphics.com>
The i8042 driver fails detection of the AUX port with some chips,
because they apparently do not change the I8042_CTR_AUXDIS bit
immediately. This is known to affect at least HP500 / HP510 notebooks,
consequently the built-in touchpad will not work. The patch will simply
reread the value until it gets the expected value or a retry limit is
hit, without touching other workaround code in the same area.

There is some discussion about non-working touchpads in HP500 notebooks
in ubuntu and a (ugly) workaround for this problem here:
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=344103.
 I've got a HP510 and
even with 2.6.21 the aux port would get disabled. Works with the patch,
for the record the i8042 here needs around 6 tries (sometimes a bit
more, sometimes less) until it reads the I8042_CTR_AUXDIS bit correctly,
both after disabling and enabling the aux port.
