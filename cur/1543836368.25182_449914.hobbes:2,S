Hi,
   Two things:
1) While compiling some code this morning on my AMD64 machine using
2.6.17-rt8 I had a hard crash. Everything was hung  - the compile,
Gnome, everything - and I didn't seem to be able to get out with and
key combination so I did a hard reset.
2) I tried rebooting into 2.6.17-rt8 and hung during the boot process.
I managed to catch one not-so-good photo (the flash was on) showing
the "3-level deep critical section nesting". Let me know who to send
it to off list. The end shows something like:
__sched_text_start+0x3b/0x58f...[<00000000>] <=0x0
rt_lock_slowclock_)x30/0x23e...[<00000000>] <=0x0
rt_lock_slowclock_)x30/0x23e...[<00000000>] <=0x0
Up above there is some stuff like:
rt_lock_slowdown
get_page_from_freelist
get_zeroed_page
pte_alloc
__handle_mm_fault.
do_(something I cannot read)
do_(somethign I cannot read)
debug_(something)_mutex_unlock
error_exit
Unfortunately stuff in there is blanked out by the flash reflecting on
the screen. (Stupid me! Sorry!)
   I've gone back to 2.6.17-rt5 for now which has been running great
and never crashed on me.
   I hope this little bit helps confirm some of what you all are
debuggin in your other threads.
Cheers,
Mark
