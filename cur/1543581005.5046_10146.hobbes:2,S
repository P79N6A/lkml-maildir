It would actually be nice to have a whole collect of compiler tests in the
kernel; whenever we fall over a compiler bug add the test and leave it in.
Possibly as a separate block of the code.
One thing to remember is not to test for compiler versions; versions which
cause problems on x86 might work fine on real systems and the otherway
round.
