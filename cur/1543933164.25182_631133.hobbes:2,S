Ok, found the culprit, now to figure out the motive and fix it.
ib_srp's srp_cleanup_module calls srp_release_transport(), which calls
transport_container_unregister() for the rport_attr_cont member of
struct srp_internal.
That last unregister call is returning -EBUSY, but it gets ignored, and
the list node gets erased (or just reused) when the module's text/memory
is free'd.
Now, to see if ib_srp should be waiting for everything to be destroyed
before calling srp_release_transport(), or if it is just not removing
some attributes properly.
That's a next week thing if no one beats me to it.
