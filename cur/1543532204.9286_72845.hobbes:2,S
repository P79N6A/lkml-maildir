If the chipset is tuned correctly and the drive is put in the correct
transfer rate "it runs flawlessly".  Even under PCI/APIC with a PIIX3
440FX PPro........this is with a broken MPTable, also........
I can not make the came for VIA yet.........
The question is how are they using the device?
tar -cvvf /dev/ht0 -b 64 *
Is the only way to call it with tar......you call the device with the
wrong block size and the buffer blows out and would probably yield IRQ
errors........
