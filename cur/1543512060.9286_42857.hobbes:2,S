       Really?   I'm afraid your conservatism exceeds mine.
       You don't need ownership, except as root, on a filesystem to boot
       a Linux+devfs system.   It might not resemble a ``standard'' Unix
       system,  but one of the spiffy things about a Unix kernel is that
       it can be adapted to a wide variety of environment.

       msdos.
       Dunno about vfat;  the msdos filesystem is good enough for the
       purposes that I'd want to put it to.

       I'm sorry, but your failure of imagination is not my responsibility.

       david parsons \bi/ Of course, to properly use a msdos filesystem I'd
                      \/    have to figure out a way to get the IBM 2.88 mb

			                shortterm solution with a zip drive.
