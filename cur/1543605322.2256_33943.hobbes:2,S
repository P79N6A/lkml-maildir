I'm playing with an external, SCSI-based DVD-RAM drive (a Hitachi GF-2050, 
marketed by Fantom).  I've got a few questions regarding Linux support for 
DVD-RAM:
1. I assume Linux supports read-only access of a DVD-RAM drive, but which 
filesystem should be used to access the device?
2. Does Linux support write access to DVD-RAM devices?  If so, can someone 
point me to a HOW-TO?
3. This device supports both single- (2.7GB) and double-sided (5.4GB) 
media.  Does Linux make any distinction between the 2 types?
Thanks.
