After going over things, I think that I'll redo my patch on top of that 
one, as it means that architectures that can optimize away the save/restore 
of irq flags will be able to benefit from that.  Maybe after all this is 
said and done we can clean things up sufficiently to be able to inline the 
inc/dec where it is simple enough to do so.
