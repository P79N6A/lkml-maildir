agressive power management settings or a CPU cooler program/driver may help
if the problem is overheating, however I doubt that they would actually
solve the problem, at best they would work around it, for a while at least.
If it is overheating you better get a better CPU fan and some heat tranfer
compound.  However I don't think that this is an overheating problem.
Overheating CPU's usually don't start to die for a couple to a few minutes
after bootup and even then the actual time of its death would be somewhat
random.  It takes time for a CPU to overcook itself.  If it were heating
problems serious enougth to be causing immediate crashes then I doubt very
much that any OS would survive on that machine unless it loaded a CPU cooler
driver immediately upon bootup.  Before running out and trying to diagnose a
hardware problem, I'd suggest first another distrib.  The system on a floppy
that I've heard about lately sounds like a good bet.  A slackware boot/root
combo would also be good
