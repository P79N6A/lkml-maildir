Hmm. Interesting idea. Just we need answer slightly earlier then in a decade :-((

It's just application of "general principle": if cleanups will broke things
they must be postponed for next stable release of kernel. Not more. If thay
are ready and working that is :-)

If you need it then you'll need some other OS. Not Linux.

To me it looks like just application of general principle, nothing more.

So far noone suggested ANYTHING better then implement-try-and-reimplement
style of development. Of course you can (and SHOULD) try to avoid as much
uglyness as possible but in the end story is always the same: something was
not taked into account when API/driver interaface/cacheing sysbsystem/whatever
was developed. Better to have well-established way to eliminate obsoleted/ugly
things in planned fashion then try to keep all accumulated cruft... You MUST
expect breakage when upgrading from 1.2 to 2.0, from 2.0 to 2.2, from
2.2 to 2.4 and so on...
