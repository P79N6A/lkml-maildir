If I'm not mistaken: You can not tell mmap and mremap to explicitely 
exchange two pages. (Mremap resizes an existing memory mapping.)
Perhaps I did not explain my idea good enough: I want something along 
the lines "Current memory contents in page starting at address X move to 
address Y and the contents of the page starting at address Y shall be 
found at address X in future".
