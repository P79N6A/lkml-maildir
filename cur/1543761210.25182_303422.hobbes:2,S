Subject: [PATCH] Reserve Bootmem fix for booting nondefault location kernel
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/3/16/87

This patch fixes a problem with reserving memory during boot up of a kernel
built for non-default location. Currently boot memory allocator reserves the
memory required by kernel image, boot allocaotor bitmap etc. It assumes that
kernel is loaded at 1MB (HIGH_MEMORY hard coded to 1024*1024). But kernel can
be built for non-default locatoin, hence existing hardcoding will lead to
reserving unnecessary memory. This patch fixes it.
