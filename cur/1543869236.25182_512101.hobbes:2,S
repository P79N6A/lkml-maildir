It was nasty, I certainly agree.  :-)

Well, there allowable by the specification, and then there is expected and
reasonable.  It seems reasonable to me that the file times should be
updated _sometime_, even if the application does not take proactive action
to cause them to be updated.  Otherwise, it would be easy to end up with a
file, whose contents are updated and reside on stable storage, but whose
mtime never changes.  Part of the motivation behind starting this work was
to address the situation where an application modifies files using mmap
but then backup software would never see the need to backup those files.
It seems to me that if something like sync() causes the file contents to
be written to stable storage, then the file metadata should follow in a
not too distant fashion.
    Thanx...
