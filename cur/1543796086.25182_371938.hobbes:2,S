Subject: loadavg always equal or above 1.00 - how to explain?

I noticed one of my Samba + OpenLDAP servers, running 2.6.11.4 kernel 
has loadavg always equal or above 1.00, although I can't explain it.
# cat /proc/loadavg
1.00 1.10 1.06 1/65 782
This server is barely used, and as I remember, loadavg was always close 
to 0.00 on that system.
When I view the process list with top, no process takes more than 1% of 
CPU time; RAM usage is also minimal:
# free
              total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        320836     241016      79820          0      23308     177232
-/+ buffers/cache:      40476     280360
Swap:       811272      14612     796660
This has ~ 50 processes running (ps aux|wc -l), and ~ 50 network 
connections (netstat -tupna|wc -l), so everything normal.
Nothing unusual in dmesg, too.
What can cause this anormal load, and how can I spot it?
