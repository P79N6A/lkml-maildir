In Australia, devices require approval from a regulatory body.  Such
approval is withheld if appropriate safeguards are not applied.

Yes it is; but what is simple, is to understand that lack of such
safeguards, even though they are imperfect, does result in refusal to
approve.

That is what I was saying: To require that only GPL-licenced USB drivers

embedded market is simply huge.  Microsoft would _love_ Linux to fail
there, because that's what's necessary for Wince to win.
