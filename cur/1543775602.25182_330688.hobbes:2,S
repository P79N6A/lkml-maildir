This code is rather pointless.  The ltt_mux is doing all the real
work and it's not included.  And while we're at it the layering for
it is wrong aswell - the ltt_log_event API should be implemented by
the actual multiplexer with what's in ltt_log_event now minus the
irq disabling becoming a library function.
Exporting a pointer to the root dentry seems like a very wrong API
aswell, that's an implementation detail that should be hidden.
Besides that the code is not following Documentation/CodingStyle
at all, please read it.
Besides that I'd sugest scrapping the ltt name and ltt_ prefix - we know
we're on linux, adn we don't care whether it's a toolkit, but spelling trace_
out would actually be a lot more descriptive.  So what about trace_* symbol
names and trace.[ch] filenames?
