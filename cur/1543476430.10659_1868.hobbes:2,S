While debugging some user-level code today, I was puzzled by 
a flood of messages appearing on the console and in the syslog
when I was running gdb. Like these:
Jan 10 10:02:20 osiris kernel: Process: unmime (stack=c6979ef0, task=c6978000)
Jan 10 10:02:20 osiris kernel: [<c010868f>] [<c0119655>] [<c0100000>] [<c010e6f1>] [<c010e951>] [<c0108eff>] [<c0108a39>] [<c010897c>]

Jan 10 10:02:20 osiris kernel: Process: unmime (stack=c6979ef0, task=c6978000)
Jan 10 10:02:20 osiris kernel: [<c010868f>] [<c0119655>] [<c0100000>] [<c010e6f1>] [<c010e951>] [<c0108eff>] [<c0108a39>] [<c010897c>]
(The problem I was debugging turned out to be a simple null-pointer
dereferencing - isspace(*p) with p==null).
They were annoying, and I guess one could launch a denial-of-service
attack through this (flooding syslog, filling up the log-file partition).
The printouts come from arch/i386/kernel/ptrace.c:print_child_state(),
which is called from sys_ptrace() in the same file. Judging from the
indentation, it looks like a debugging printout that was not removed
before putting it into the kernel sources ?
        read_unlock(&tasklist_lock);    /* FIXME!!! */
        if (!child)
                goto out;
print_child_state(child);
        ret = -EPERM;
        if (pid == 1)           /* you may not mess with init */
                goto out;
I guess the call to print_child_state() should be removed ?
