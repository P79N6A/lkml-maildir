Really? I've mostly seen symbols added, very rarely did I see constraints
changed. But that might be just my narrow view on the matter...

I understand that to mean: "If it is new and (at least somewhat)
unconstrained, ask the user.  If fully constrained, take that value
unconditionally." This is a _very_ different case from a broken
configuration as a starting point, in which constraints are violated with
the values as set.
Hell, I had to rebuild my .config files from scratch a few times already
because of wild changes in the hardware on which the resulting kernels
would have to run, its not _that_ big a deal to have to perhaps have to do
it once each time a new stable kernel series starts or so.
People, remember that doing certain things in software is just not worth
the effort.
