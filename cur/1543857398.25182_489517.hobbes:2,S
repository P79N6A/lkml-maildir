It runs OK though the system seems to fail a lot of tests.

If you see my other post, booting in SMP and decompressing the kernel 
tree on CPU 0 took 1m 35s, and CPU 1 still hadn't finished in 40m when I 
killed it to run the LFDK.
I'm running the latest HP BIOS and I don't think it's possible to put 
the ASUS one on, any idea what I can do to fix it?
Thank you for your help.
