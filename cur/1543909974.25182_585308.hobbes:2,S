On my laptop (this is a *laptop*, mind you):
% df -i /home
Filesystem            Inodes   IUsed   IFree IUse% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/VolGroup00-home
                      655360  532361  122999   82% /home
What happens if I do a 'mv /home /home1'?  Looks like more than a "relatively
small" number.  A cold-cache 'find' takes a few minutes to wade through it all,
so any solutions you come up with should beware of locking issues...
