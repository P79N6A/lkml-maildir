There is no real problem. You know I did this several times
and also sent patches at various points in time. Asking Google yields
	
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0103.3/0038.html
as the first reference, and it has all relevant details and an example patch.
(There was a discussion about 32 vs 64 bits. Of course 64 is better
in all respects, but it is no longer feasible so today it must be 32.
Too bad.)
