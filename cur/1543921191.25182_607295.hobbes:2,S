Weeeell now, that skepticism is indeed well founded.  It's dontdiff.  A
diff of trees where defkeymap.c_shipped has been modified produces no
output.  Once a working tree has been afflicted by using diff+dontdiff
to update it, even overwriting the entire tree via git-archive doesn't
lead to a good build unless you also touch defkeymap.c_shipped
afterward.  In my case, the working tree remained buildable yet
thoroughly busted through a lengthy bisect and beyond.  That bisect
positively identified... the victim.
poo.
