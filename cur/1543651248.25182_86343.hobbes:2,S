Subject: 2.5.45: make menuconfig: (NEW) disappears once touched
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/11/3/50

If I go to any item marked (NEW), like this:
< > Gameport support (NEW)
and press y,n or m (does not matter), it gets
appropriately selected but '(NEW)' disappers.
Why?
