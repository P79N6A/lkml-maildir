   Ok, I was all set to switch to static inlines, but it doesn't work.
Compiling w/ debug on, _dbg is undefined, which is part of the
ACPI_DB_INFO macro, but it only gets setup by the ACPI_FUNCTION_NAME
macro.  Guess I got lucky by choosing to do it as a macro.  IMHO, it
doesn't really make sense to make the static inline functions more
complicated or hide where they're getting called to make this all work.
So, I think the choices are to stick with the ugly macros or put #ifdefs
around the code and essentially leave it the way it is.  Sorry I didn't
give it a more thorough look when originally questioned.  Better ideas?
Thanks,
	Alex
