All of 3c59x, acenic, sunhme, sungem do all of ipv4 right.
sunhme and sungem get ipv6 right as well because they just treat the
checksummed area as an opaque buffer, whereas the other chips really
do checksummming in an ipv4 specific way.
You can check for this "ipv4 only checksumming" feature attribute
being set in the driver, via NETIF_F_IP_CSUM.
The smarter chips which checksum in a protocol independant way will
use NETIF_F_HW_CSUM.
