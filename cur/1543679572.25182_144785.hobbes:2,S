Right, this patch will introduce virtual directory hardlinks - multiple dentries
to one directory inode. But it also makes dentry validation mandatory for such
filesystems to fix it. I was not able to prevent such hardlinking as there must
already exist two valid dentries named "dir" and "DIR" to call rename("dir").
Patch successfuly being used over 1.5 year on server to vindicate it a bit. :-)
