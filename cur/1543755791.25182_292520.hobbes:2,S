I see.  I got atomic_dec and atomic_dec_and_test mixed up.
So the problem isn't as big as I thought which is good.  sk_buff
is only in trouble because of the atomic_read optimisation which
really needs a memory barrier.
However, instead of adding a memory barrier which makes the optimisation
less useful, let's just get rid of the atomic_read.

Thanks for the document, it's really helpful.
Cheers,
