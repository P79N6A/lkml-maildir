Hi !
I have Slackware 9.1 (with all erratas) installed on compaq dl380. I 
have compiled 2.6.3 kernel and machine can not boot.
 From screen:

NET: Registered protocol family 2
IP: routing cache hash table of 8192 buchets, 64Kbytes
TCP: Hash tables configured (established 262144 bind 65536)
NET: Registered protocol family 1
NET: Registered protocol family 17
and boot process stops here.
I tryed with -mm3 patches - same result.
