I was under the impression that the wineserver used ptrace() to retrieve
argument data to requests such as CreateFile(), but thinking about it, that
can't be so, since that'd mean you couldn't strace a wine program, which you
can.
It must instead pass all the argument data either by socket or by shared
memory (I'm not sure which offhand).
It does, however, (at least, I think it does), use this for debugging support,
but that's a special case.

I suppose this is more of an implementation detail, but it's primarily why I
added an RPC mechanism.

And that's why I wanted a kernel interface to the registry stuff, for which
the RPC mechanism was added.

However, I could make a Window a waitable GDI object... implementing
GetMessage() as Wait, GetAsync.
What I'd need to do is make it possible for the RPC server to create
signallable handles of effectively user-defined type that can be issued by and
passed through RPC calls. Hmmm... I'll have to think about that, but I'll
probably have to do something along these lines to support registry change
notifications.

But it is there. I think it may use WinStation handles somehow, but I don't
know for sure without a bit of disassembly work.

It depends on what you want... What I'd like is basically a range of Win32
system handles that map to (or apparently map to) kernel services. I'd also
like these to be available for ordinary Linux programs to play with if they
want to.
However, I think I might be able to see what you mean... I could implement an
RPC server, say, that has one exported operation: do registry op. Then have
all the registry operations mapped down by a userspace library to the RPC
invocation call to a single operation on that particular server.

This is one of the things I was trying to avoid:
 (1) select and poll do not implement the entire range of things you can do
     with WaitForMultipleObjects;
 (2) the struct file+struct dentry+struct inode complex is incredibly heavy
     for most of what I want to do (though does have advantages);
 (3) Linux file structures do not hold enough information to support
     CreateFile (access & sharing interactions).

True... Isn't it nice when you can provide what API's you want rather than
having to make do with whatever is dictated to you. Yes... I'm implementing
some of the Windows system APIs because I'd like to have that functionality
available under Linux running as fast as possible, not because it's the only
one worth using:-)
