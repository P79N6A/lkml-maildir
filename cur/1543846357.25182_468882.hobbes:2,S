These patches make my Vaio run really really slowly.  Maybe a quarter of
the normal speed or lower.  Bisection shows that the bug is introduced by
clockevents-drivers-for-i386.patch+clockevents-drivers-for-i386-fix.patch
With all patches applied, the slowdown happens with
CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS=n and also with CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS=y &&
CONFIG_NO_HZ=y.  So something got collaterally damaged.
I put various helpful stuff at 
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/x/
I uploaded all the patches I was using to
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/x/patches/
It doesn't seem to be a cpufreq thing: cpuinfo_min_freq=800kHz,
cpuinfo_max_freq=2GHz and cpuinfo_cur_freq goes up to 2GHz under load. 
Wall time is increasing at one second per second.
