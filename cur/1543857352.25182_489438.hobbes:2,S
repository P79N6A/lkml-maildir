  i just noticed that there are numerous invocations of kcalloc()
where the hard-coded first arg of # elements is "1", which seems like
an inappropriate use of kcalloc().
  the only rationale i can see is that kcalloc() guarantees that the
memory will be set to zero, so i'm guessing that this form of
kcalloc() was used before kzalloc() existed, or was used by folks who
didn't know that kzalloc() existed.
  if a (zero-filled) single struct is being allocated, is it worth
codifying that that allocation should use kzalloc() and not
kcalloc(1,...)?
