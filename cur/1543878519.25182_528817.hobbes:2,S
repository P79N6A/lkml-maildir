Linus, please pull from the for-linus branch at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ieee1394/linux1394-2.6.git for-linus
to receive the appended clarification (?) about the dv1394 driver and
ABI.  It has been discussed on linux1394-devel and linux1394-user.
Or apply from this mail.  Thanks.

ieee1394: change deprecation status of dv1394
Nobody ported ffmpeg from dv1394 to rawiso yet, and there is no
justification to remove dv1394 right now.
Nevertheless, a strong deprecation of this ABI makes a lot of sense,
especially as Kristian H's drivers shape up to be an attractive
alternative to the existing ones.  But we don't have a schedule at the
moment.

+What:		dv1394 (a.k.a. "OHCI-DV I/O support" for FireWire)
+Contact:	linux1394-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
+Description:
+	New application development should use raw1394 + userspace libraries
+	instead, notably libiec61883 which is functionally equivalent.
+
+Users:
+	ffmpeg/libavformat (used by a variety of media players)
+	dvgrab v1.x (replaced by dvgrab2 on top of raw1394 and resp. libraries)
