Subject: i810_audio.c v0.11 is still broken (deadlocks)

Downloaded i810_audio.c v0.11 this morning. 
After loading it I'm getting system deadlock immediatelly after first attempt 
to use sound support as i810_write() calls i810_update_lvi() without setting
PCM_ENABLE_INPUT bit. Added setting this bit in i810_write() and
also some protection against deadlocks in __i810_update_lvi() with 
corresponding error message (see attached diffs).
Results: sound seems to work as far as I have tested for not a very long time.
I'm still getting messages that __i810_update_lvi() is called without setting
PCM_ENABLE_INPUT (which would cause deadlock without protection
I added there).
