You're still missing the point.  One driver supports a whole lot of
hardware because the hardware conforms to a standard interface, and NOT
because the driver contains a whole lot of special-casing to deal with
quirks of different hardware.  You don't need a stupid mapping of
proprietary methods of doing the same thing; that's the point of having
a standard.  We just don't need to have multiple instances of the SCSI
driver for different brands of disks; if it's a SCSI disk, then it
should conform to the SCSI standard, and the standard SCSI driver will
be able to use it without any special-casing.
If the hardware tries to pervert the standard by adding a lot of
proprietary features to its interface, or in particular tries to require
the proprietary features for basic access to the hardware, then it's not
standard hardware.
