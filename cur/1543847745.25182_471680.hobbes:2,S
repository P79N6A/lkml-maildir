yup.

Things like __block_write_full_page() avoid this by checking the block's
offset against i_size.  (Not racy against truncate-down because the page is
locked, not racy against truncate-up because the bh is zero and
up-to-date).
But for jbd writeout we don't hold the page lock, so checking against
bh->b_page->host->i_size is a bit racy.
hm.  But we do lock the buffers in journal_invalidatepage(), so checking
i_size after locking the buffer in the writeout path might get us there.
