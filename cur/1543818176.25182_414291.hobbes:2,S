Excellent point! It was bothering me as well but i couldnt express my
view eloquently as you did.

Thats besides the point. You could, for example, use 1.1.1.1/24 in your
network instead of the 10.x or 192.x; and i have seen people use 10.x
in what appears to be public networks. We dont have speacial checks for 
RFC 1918 IP addresses for example.
169.254.0.0/16 is by definition link local. I think point made by Janos
is we should look at the attributes rather than value.
Have your user space set it to be link local and then fix the kernel if
it doesnt do the right thing.

Again, that is beside the point.
