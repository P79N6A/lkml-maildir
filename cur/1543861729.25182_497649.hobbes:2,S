Hi,
   Im unable to compile linux 2.6.14 with gcc 4.x, but new versions of
kernel i can compile.
   with gcc 4.x.
   It gives errors - that seem to disappear when compiled with gcc - 3.4.x
  I really dont understand why?.
 Is there anyway we can compile lower versions of linux using gcc 4.x.
 Im using a arm-linux-gcc.
Regards,
sriram
