I noticed another patch from Alan "lots-of-architectures: enable
arbitary speed tty support" is added to -mm tree, which defined struct
termios2. That is required by this one.
So it should be tested together and merged together, although Aubrey
didn't received the
lots-of-architectures-enable-arbitary-speed-tty-support.patch from LKML.
Thanks a lot
