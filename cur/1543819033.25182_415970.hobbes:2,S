I looked at this in detail last month, hoping to get it
out of the way, but unfortunately found that, in dm-crypt:
  Instead of the stack growing, we'll be allocating successive
  bios out of the *same* mempool and, without the recursion, we'll
  have lost the possibility of a later allocation waiting for an
  earlier one to be released after its endio.
In other words, I think part of dm-crypt needs re-writing to avoid problems
under memory pressure after this patch is applied.  And on the face of it,
__clone_and_map() may suffer from similar problems should a bio need to be
split into several pieces.
