I went after both, built them both and fired them off, cpuburn-in for 
2 hours that last time, and compiled memburn for half my ram or 
512kb.
Where memtest86-3.2a didn't find anything, this combination has twice 
found a bad memory location.
From the first run, at round 81 over some half a gig, at 130017311 it 
got 7bf001f, expected 7bfe81f and reread it 3 times as 7bf001f.
On the next run, I started cpuburn first, and fired off memburn again, 
and got this:
Passed round 133, elapsed 4827.19.
FAILED at round 134/14208927: got ff00, expected 0!!!
REREAD: ff00, ff00, ff00!!!
So there is apparently something fubar someplace.  I've now recompiled 
it for testing 768 megs, and while that startup is normal, its also 
shoved 150 megs out to swap and the machine is lagging quite a bit.
cpuburn isn't running, according to the cpu temps, setiathome also 
does a fine job of that.  It also didn't take much time for memburn 
to exit with this:
[root@coyote memburn]# ./memburn
Starting test with size 768 megs..
Passed round 0, elapsed 44.36.
Passed round 1, elapsed 74.13.
Passed round 2, elapsed 105.12.
FAILED at round 3/25777183: got 2b00, expected 0!!!
REREAD: 2b00, 2b00, 2b00!!!
I just fixed the printf statement in memburn for a 8 digit hex output, 
seeing only 4 as above bothers me when I know the address being read 
is an 8 digit pointer to an 8 digit hex value.  I also fixed the 
scanf conversions use of the atoi so you can enter the value in 
megbytes without haveing to reset its default and recompile it.
Yeah, I know just enough C to be dangerous :)
I'm going to run this until I have enough data to point to the exact 
memory chip on these sticks if I can.  I'm also surprised that there 
has been no Oops while allocating 768 megs of ram to run this in.
