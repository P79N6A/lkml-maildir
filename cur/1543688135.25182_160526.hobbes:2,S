You may want to run w/o HT at all for your particular problem, or limit
threads to the number of physical CPUs. Having multiple threads trying
to do ffts is likely to thrash the cache, and will result in contention
for the (single) FPU.
The schedular would seem to lack the information to make a determination
of the magnitude of the fpu contention, and by making better use of HT
it makes the contention worse.
Perhaps there should be a "don't hyperthread" attribute one could set to
hint that running multiple threads in a single CPU is unlikely to work
well. Since there isn't, I don't know a way to avoid the problem unless
you can set maxthreads to Ncpu.
