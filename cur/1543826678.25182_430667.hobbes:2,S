The kernel has differing opinions about that:
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000000000 - 000000000009fc00 (usable)
 BIOS-e820: 000000000009fc00 - 00000000000a0000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000000e0000 - 0000000000100000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000100000 - 0000000038000000 (usable)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000fec00000 - 00000000fec01000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000fee00000 - 00000000fee01000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000fffc0000 - 0000000100000000 (reserved)
0MB HIGHMEM available.
896MB LOWMEM available.

Well.  Applying this with `patch -R' would presumably restore the situation.
But not having a clue why this change was made, I didn't bother trying it.
From what you're saying, it appears that this patch is an unrelated change,
to fix the off-by-one?  And that if this machine had anything other than
exactly 7*128MB of physical memory, I wouldn't have noticed?
