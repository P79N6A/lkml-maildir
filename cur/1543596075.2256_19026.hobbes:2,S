Yes, and I am not arguing that all my customers should go Linux. But the 
way that MS goes marketing their crappy products, bundling w/ Windblows 
is atrocious. I have gotten very sick and tired of every one thinking 
that because Word is MS product, it must be perfect, or if not perfect, 
and least the best possible. I am also sick of being expected to use MS 
products, or lose out on school assignments and business b/c M$ was an 
asshole and doesn't support Wordperfect, Star Office, etc (yes, I know 
that star office can read word)
Because of their predatory practices I am stuck w/ their mediocre 
products.  I must support their products; I am expected to get a MCSE so 
I can get a job (at the moment I work for my father, so I don't need one).
If I want to set up a Linux server (my father and I are working on 
making this a solution for a few of our larger customers) I still have 
to deal with interoperatbility with a system that breaks all the rules 
(standards) makes their own, etc.
Yes, I do do the work, b/c it makes me money (not enough, b/c I can't 
get enuff hours, but the hourly pay is terrific), doesn't mean that I 
have a choice of whom I support. Yes, I could just drop the field. But 
that would mean giving up, and that doesn't sound like a choice either. 
So I work within the system to change it. Meanwhile, if this was 
something else, I could probably sue for emotional damage or something 
else (tongue in cheek). If I was imprisoned wrongly, I could get 
compensation right(don't ansewer this, it's rhetorical).
But don't just tell me to butt out, b/c I can't change it. I refuse to 
believe that.
