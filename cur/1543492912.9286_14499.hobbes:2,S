Hello,
Attached is two patches, one of which should probably be applied for
consistency in the configurators but neither of which are really truly
necessary. (But I'm always of the opinion that a little bit of consistency
goes a long way towards maintainability. Or something sage like that.)
Patch 1: Changes CONFIG_HFS to rely on CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL. This is how it
looks like it should be as the configuration option has (experimental)
after it but the check is not made.
Patch 2: Change the CONFIG_HFS line to remove the "experimental" and leave
everything else as is.
Really no-brainers.
Joe
