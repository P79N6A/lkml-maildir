Not as much as I yelled when the inter_module_crap was added in the
first place. I'll be happy to see the back of it.
The code which uses it is in need of a redesign anyway, and I'd
previously said that I didn't want a patch which _only_ removes the
inter_module_crap; the warnings there were actually a real indication
that something more was needed. But at the Kernel Summit I was persuaded
otherwise -- I'd accept a minimal patch just to kill the warning.

Agreed. And even though it's deprecated, people don't _really_ stop
using it till it's dead.
