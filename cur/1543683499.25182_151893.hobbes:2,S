Huh?  I thought Hans was being facetious, or was practicing his  
standup comedy.  I can see something like that coming out of a far 
western oriental type when dealing with an american that isn't really 
understanding his accent, but here in the states, after we've 
explained it once in plain english, the next exchange will more than 
likely go the other way, possibly even making it to the 'hey 
dumbf*ck' stage on about the 4th reply.
And I do object, albeit somewhat tongue-in-cheek, to applying that 
particular label/broad brush to all americans since I am one of those 
creatures.
