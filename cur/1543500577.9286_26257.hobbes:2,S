   Related to this, can I pass on a question I was recently asked: How
   does Linux deal with a corrupted partition where the lost+found entry
   is itself corrupted? Does it even detect that?
Yes, it will detect and fix a corrupted lost+found directory.  E2fsck
can even create a lost+found directory if it is missing (or too badly
damaged to recover), and it can allocate new blocks to lost+found.   
If you're easily amused, you can take a scratch partition, put some data
on it, use debugfs to clri the root directory, and then run e2fsck and
watch it recover from the damage.  It will recreate a root directory and
a lost+found directory, and put everything that used to be in the root
directory into lost+found.  Aside from the names of the directories and
files in the root directory, no actual data will be lost.
