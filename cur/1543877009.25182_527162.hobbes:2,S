No, there's no conflict with disabled overcommit here: Committed_AS
accounting is done on the whole vma size (at mmap or brk time), no
matter how many pages may or may not be faulted in later.  Rather
like RLIMIT_AS.  The proposed madvise operation won't affect it.
(But I take Ulrich's "must succeed" with one pinch of salt:
Out-Of-Memory killing remains a possibility, of course.)
