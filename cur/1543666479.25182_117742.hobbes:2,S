On m68k and MIPS, we do not derefence SASR to get the port number, SASR _is_
the MMIO pointer to the 8-bit SASR register. Hence you access the register by
dereferencing the pointer.

Actually, it was my suggestion to remove the dereference for PIO accesses. In
that case SASR contains the I/O port register.
