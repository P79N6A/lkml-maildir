Hello all,
The file 
http://www.cs.uwindsor.ca/~kamran/downloads/dipc-2.1-alpha2.tgz
 
contains new kernel files with all the functionality of the messages, 
semaphores, and shared memories theoretically available (the kernel compiles 
but no tests have been done).
Now there is also support for m68k, sparc and alpha CPUs (in addition to 
i386). bringing back support for for MIPS and PPC is pending.
Pease let me know of the results If you tried DIPC.
Thanks.
-Kamran
