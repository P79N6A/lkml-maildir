Which makes sense so far.

It doesn't make sense for this configuration to fail in this way, I agree.
Essentially, the ESP and AH transforms should be a magic netfilter rule, so 
you can insert them in a netfilter chain and do this sort of thing.  If 
they aren't, we should at least have the input and output chains traversed 
by packets both before and after the transforms.
The issue exists, I'm convinced.  Dang, I'm going to run into it too one 
day soon.  Another thing that needs looking at, in case noone else fixes it 
first.

You're welcome,
