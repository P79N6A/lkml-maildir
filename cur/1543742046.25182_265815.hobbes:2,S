The "attributes" stored are really mail flags such as "read", "replied
to", the size and so on. Not sure if it makes sense storing these as
extended attributes, or, the other way around, are EAs supposed to be
some "associated" generic file that can be attached to an existing file?
At any rate, the resulting software would no longer be able to call
its backing storage to be in "Maildir" format.
I know AmigaOS had a limited amount of space (some dozen characters) for
a generic file comment, but otherwise.
