This sounds like another good reason to have URBs take scatterlists
directly, oddly enough. :)

I presume there is some overhead in bouncing to lowmem?  I imagine that
highmem support for the HCDs wouldn't be that difficult -- they are just
PCI devices, after all.
I'd rather eliminate as much overhead as possible -- I already get
complaints from performance fanatics about the inability of usb-storage to
get past 92% bus saturation (sustained), and the problem will only get
worse on USB 2.0

Hrm... isn't that what one of the patches sent did?  Or does that only work
for lowmem allocations described by the structure?
