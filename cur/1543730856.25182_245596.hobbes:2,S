  You're right the goal is the same as SGI's Comprehensive System
Accounting. When I started this project there was _no_ activity from the
PAGG and CSA projects (it was during march if I remember). I saw that
possibility to do accounting not only for one process but for a group
of processes was missing in Linux. That's why, I started ELSA. 
I will respond to your comments regarding the two projects on lse-tech 
mailing list.

Guillaume
