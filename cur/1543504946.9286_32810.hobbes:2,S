I have to admit that when I need to write an email in any language
other than English, I usually write it in English, then ask BabelFish
to translate it for me and send whatever that comes up with as an
attachment to the original email, with a note that it was generated
automatically and may not be (probably isn't) 100% accurate as a
result.
Best wishes from Riley.
