I'd suggest making this be:
 - handle_mm_fault() take a more detailed flag ("read / write / copy", 
   where the new "copy" part is a write that actually leaves the page 
   only readable, but marks it dirty)
 - we do "follow-page" with a read.
That should be sufficient, I think: since "handle_mm_fault()" marks the 
page dirty (but not writable) and will have done all the work to do a COW, 
we know that once we do the "follow_page()", we'll be getting a private 
copy. Which is what we wanted.
So only "handle_mm_fault()" would actually need changing.
I think.
Anybody see any problems with this approach?
