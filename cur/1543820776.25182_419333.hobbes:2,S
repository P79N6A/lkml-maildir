> A nice feature of emptying files and buffer cache was introduced in kernel 2.6.16 but my question is: Is it possible to turn off file caching for certain operations? E.g. I do not want the kernel to cache an ISO image which is being copied from HDD to the LAN or burned to CD.
it's called O_DIRECT and madvise()
but do you rEALLY REALLY want to disable caching? Caching, even a little
bit, is essential to get ok performance; if you disable caching it's
your responsibility to do all the things needed to get good IO
performance.
