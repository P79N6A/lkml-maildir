The eeprom wasn't powered up.
Please take the 2.4.20 3c59x.c and place that into the 2.5 tree and confirm
that it does the same thing (it will).
Then try disabling APCI and/or otherwise fiddling with your power management
options (maybe in BIOS too).
One person has reported that turning off ACPI fixed this.
Thanks.
