Greetings,
- please, please, please read Documentation/CodingStyle
- kmalloc can fail
- cache seems to be disabled (?) for pages you memcpy later -> why ?
- if register_hdlc_device() fails for some device, the succeeded one are
  deallocated but not unregistered
- alloc_mem() doesn't deallocate on failure
- goto may help handling failure
