Yes; but "true" and "false" were intended for use from shell scripts.  And
exec[lv]p() fell back to the shell if the exec failed, so it even worked from 
most programs.  (I see glibc2 finally implements that fallback; [many
versions of] glibc1 didn't, which I considered a bug.)
It should also be remembered that "#!" didn't exist on those systems.

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
