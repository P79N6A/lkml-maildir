does the kernel expose a way to get the address of another process's heap
areas?  this would be for debugging purposes.
also, in /proc/<pid>/maps, what exactly is the "offset" field?  can i rely
on the stack area always having an offset field of "fffff000" ?
any ideas appreciated, even "go ask another list".
