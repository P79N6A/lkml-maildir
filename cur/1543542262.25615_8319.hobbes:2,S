Try adding the option "multiple=0". It seems that this flag changed it's
default value from 0 to 1 on test7. I sent a mail about it a week ago but
got now replies.
For us with old SB16 cards that doesn't do isapnp, it doesn't seem to work
at all.. I even got some crasches in the kernel after it had failed to
load the sb.o module..
I'm not sure if it's a bug that can be fixed or if the default value of
mutiple should go back to 0. I'm not a kernel-hacker.. I'd love some
comments from someone who knows about the sb though..
Are mutiple=1 supposed to work with old non-isapnp cards?
