No. All mailing list packages I know of have a feature of subscribers and
people allowed to post. If you want to post, you have to be on the
"poster" list, if you want to get the list, you'd be a "subscriber". You'd
usually place the subscribers into the poster category, add a bounce for
non-susbcribed people, and have "somebody" take care of subscribing the
poster to the "poster" list and forward the message to the list
proper. That's essentially what I do by hand with a 500-people linux list
around here, configured such that "subscribe" and "unsubscribe" messages to
the list also get to me first, just in case ;-)
The problem here is finding that "somebody", and ensuring {,s}he doesn't
get overwhelmed, and that response times stay low. Some questions then:
- How much traffic on the list is generated by non-subscribers?
- Is there any simple way to spread the load, i.e., get the questionable
  messages to a _list_ of whitewashers, and post the message &c when _one_
  of them OKes it?
- I assume there are possibilities for automated checks, like the RBL, and
  AFAIK they are in use. Any others that could be helpful here?
SPAM and other abuse handling is _not_ simple, the abusers thankfully stay
one or two steps behind in technical savvy, but you are forced to work on
it every day, least they catch up.
