   Yes it does, as well as the IFS (inherited filesystem) that Linux
   *did* have for a while.  It got dropped because of lack of interest,
   mostly.
Lack of developer interest, and because it was too hard to maintain; it
required making too many assumptions about how the core FS layers worked
to be easy to maintain as the VFS layer evolved.  This was before the
dentry layer was added though; it might be simpler now to do the same
thing, if somewhere to try to design it from scratch.
