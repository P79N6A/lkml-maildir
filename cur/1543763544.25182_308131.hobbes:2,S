 Yeap, That's what I'm proposing.  Block API never cares about
REQ_SPECIAL flag or ->special field except for when determining if
requests can be merged - both fields are independently checked in this
case.  And IDE driver already uses the flag regardless of ->special
field.  Do you want me to clear up the comment?

 Yes, it's non-obvious behavior of blk_insert_request() when used for
requeueing and, SCSI is the *only* user.  This patch removes the
unobvious path.

 But block drivers in general don't have to inhibit reordering
requeued requests.  SCSI midlayer caches resources over requeueing, so
it's SCSI midlayer's requirement that requeued requests shouldn't be
passed.  IOW, it's SCSI midlayer's responsibility to tell the block
layer not to reschedule the request.  REQ_SOFTBARRIER has well-defined
meaning to tell just that.  It's not a block-layer internal thing.
It's a public interface.
 IOW, this patch uses well-defined flag to tell the block layer what
the SCSI midlayer wants.  I don't see any problem there.  If you're
uncomfortable with using REQ_* flag directly, writing a wrapper
shouldn't be a problem, but, IMHO, current form seems fine.
 Thanks.
