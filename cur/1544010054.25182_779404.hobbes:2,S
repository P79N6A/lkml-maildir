These warnings are known issues. This results from a lack of lockdep annotations
in configfs. I must admit that I started to send patches for that a few months
ago, and then could not find time to finish this work.
The problem is a bit harder than just playing with I_MUTEX_CHILD, I_MUTEX_PARENT
and I_MUTEX_NORMAL, since configfs recursively locks variable numbers
(this can go to as many as the depth of the whole configfs tree) of
config_group inodes during operations like mkdir(), rmdir(), and depend_item().
I was working on two kinds of solutions:
1) insert lockdep_off()/lockdep_on() at the places of recursion,
2) separate default groups inode mutex classes according to their depth under
the created group they belong to.
People tend to reject any proposition like 1), but IIRC Joel was tending to
accept it.
Solution 2) does not work for depend_item(). This needs to rework the locking
scheme of depend_item() by removing the variable lock recursion depth, and I
think that it's doable thanks to the configfs_dirent_lock.
	Joel, what do you think about this?
Anyway, I still hope to find time for this :)
