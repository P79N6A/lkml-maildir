I'd like this one in the kernel too since I've also patched
it (although I set it to 64 not to worry anymore). It's not
uncommon to put 4 or 5 quad ethernet cards into a system
that already hosts an on-board interface. I think that at
spare time, I'll backport net_init.c from 2.4 which doesn't
have sort of these limitations.
BTW, there are also a few very little patches that would 
have to be considered :
Kai Germaschewski proposed this single-liner fix for HiSax
that could not be linked into the kernel, but I don't see it 
here (perhaps he simply forgot it, or perhaps I'm wrong) :

	int i, j, argc;
I also found that sometimes, menuconfig didn't refresh correctly (in the CPU
dialog window). This patch fixes it for me :

This one, back-ported from 2.4, avoids eventual problems with parenthesis

Robert M. Love pointed out that the command line parse could forget arguments
if either MAX_INIT_ENVS or MAX_INIT_ARGS were reached, and his patch seems to
fix it correctly :

Well, that's all for now ; I think that none of them is at risk, so if you
could apply them, that'd be great.
Thanks,
Willy
