OK... Well Andrew as I said I'd be happy for this to go in. I'd be *extra*
happy if Judith ran a few of those dbt thingy tests which had been sensitive
to idle time. Can you ask her about that? or should I?

That would be very welcome indeed. We have a big backlog of scheduler things
to go in after 2.6.9 is released (although not many of them change the runtime
behaviour IIRC). After that, I have some experimental performance work that
could use wider testing. After *that*, the multiprocessor scheduler will in a
state where 2.6 shouldn't need much more work, so we can concentrate on just
tuning the dials.
