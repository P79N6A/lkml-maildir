Subject: access to proc filesystem from chrooted process

There is a suggestion in the kernel sources that a chrooted process should only
be able to see processes that have the same root or that have a more restricted
root. 
The comment is in the source for fs/proc/inode.c:
	
http://lxr.linux.no/source/fs/proc/inode.c?v=2.3.3#L161
169  * XXX TODO: use the dentry mechanism to make off-limits procs simply
170  * invisible rather than denied?  Does each namespace root get its own
171  * dentry tree?
I wondered if anyone has done this, and wheter there are plans to include
this in the main source tree.
Regards
Peri Hankey
