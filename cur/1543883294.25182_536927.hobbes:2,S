Still works pretty reliably; the last time my PowerBook G4 was  
rebooted was 6 weeks ago.  Once every 60 suspends or so the kernel  
USB driver gets really confused and doesn't wake up the USB  
controller properly, leading to dead keyboard/mouse, but other than  
that I never have problems.  I wouldn't be surprised if I could  
comment out 90% of the "suspend" code and still have it work, the  
hardware in is is incredibly robust.  I can even swap batteries while  
it's in suspend-to-RAM, as long as I do it in less than 45 sec or so;  
I get around 6-7 days of suspend-to-RAM time on a full charge.
Cheers,
