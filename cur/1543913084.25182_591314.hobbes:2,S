Yes, I can. There is no inconsistency between acting in one case and failing
to act in another. We need not act in every possible case where we could act
to preserve our right to act in a particular case.

First of all, I haven't complained about Jiri's changes. Second, I most
certainly can. I can complain about one murder without complaining about
every murder. There is no inconsistency whatsoever with acting in one case
without having to act in every other conceivable case.
We can complain about or work to fight whatever injustices we like. There is
no obligation to address every equal, or greater, injustice before working
on the injustice of one's choice.

*My* choice of subjects?! You seem to have me confused with someone else
entirely.
My sole points in this thread were to:
1) Correct some misunderstandings about how dual licenses actually work.
2) Explain *why* a file cannot really remain dual-licensed if it's part of
the Linux kernel distribution.
While I generally prefer the BSD license to the GPL license and tend to be a
pretty vocal GPL critic, I have said many times that almost any *consistent*
license is better for a large project than different licenses, even if
they're compatible, on different files.

I'm not sure where you're getting this from, but it's not true. Linus cannot
decide tomorrow that nobody can distribute the Linux kernel anymore.
