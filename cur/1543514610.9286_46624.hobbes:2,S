(system info: Mandrake 6.0, kernel 2.2.12, i686 200MHz, 128M RAM, all
SCSI)
Friday am my system became completely hung requiring me to hit the reset
button. Unfortunately I was the cause - killed the pid for X instead of
Netscape. Anyway, once the machine came backup I logged in and started X.
I noticed that asclock had disappeared. Checking the boot log I saw that
many "deleted inode" messages had come up while booting. Anyway, I rebuilt
asclock and went on. Later in the day I noticed that X had quit - actually
crashed. I noticed console messages indicating X had lost connectivity to
the display (0.0). 
After a bit of troubleshooting and blaming one thing or another, I have
realized that the system is crashing whenever it wants, but X crashes
consistently within starting it. The system itself may still run for
several hours. I managed to capture the following message during this past
crash:
Aiee, killing interrupt handler
Kernel Panic: Attempted to kill the idle task!
Interrupt handler - not syncing
I am working on implementing a "disaster recovery" type restore, but if
anyone has any ideas how I can keep the system stable while I restore
/usr, please let me know!
