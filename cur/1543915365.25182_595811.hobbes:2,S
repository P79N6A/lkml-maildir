Subject: NetXen driver causing slab corruption in -RT kernels

In doing some stress testing of the NetXen driver, I found that my machine was 
dying in all sorts of weird ways.  I saw several different crashes, BUG 
messages in the TCP stack and some assert messages in the TCP stack as well.  
I really didn't think that there could be six different bugs all at once in 
the TCP/IP stack, so I started looking at possible memory corruption.
I first saw this on 2.6.16-rt22 with a backported netxen driver from 2.6.22.  
I figured I should try the latest kernel, so I tried it on 2.6.23-rc6-git7 
but could not trigger the slab corruption messages with CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB, so 
I figured the race must only exist in the -RT kernels.  Next I tried 
2.6.23-rc6-git7-rt1 (I applied patch-2.6.23-rc4-rt1 patch to 2.6.23-rc6-git7 
and fixed the 5 failing hunks).  After an hour or so, lots of slab corruption 
messages showed up:
Slab corruption: size-2048 start=f40c4670, len=2048
Slab corruption: size-2048 start=f313cf48, len=2048

The stress test that I am running is basically a mixed bag of stuff I threw 
together.  It runs eight concurrent netperf TCP streams and two concurrent 
UDP streams in both directions, (and on both 10GbE interfaces), ping -f in 
both directions, some more disk/cpu loads in the background and a little bit 
of NFS traffic thrown in for good measure.
