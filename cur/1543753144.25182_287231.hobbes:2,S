I don't really know anything about that stuff, but what the manuals say is
that using any MMX instruction resets the tag bits and clears the TOS field.
So the patch doesn't change anything for that case (tos == 0).

I don't really know, but I have two flavors of manual in front of me.
I suspect you remember incorrectly, or perhaps in the past there was
something like that.  AFAICT, it's always the case that MMX clears the TOS
bits and mmx0 = physical fpr0, which also = st(0) since TOS = 0.
Thanks,
Roland
