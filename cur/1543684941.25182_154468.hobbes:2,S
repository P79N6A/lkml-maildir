I know this is not useful info but I hope I am not the
only one experiencing this problem. If anyone can get
hold of the Fujitsu E-7010 laptop, you should be able
to reproduce this results. Let me know if you want my
.config. I have tested my ram using memtest86, no errors
at all. I have yet test a minimal kernel configuration 
as suggested by Andrew but will do so later on but I am
sure it will be a painful one, even with ccache :/
