It's still important for programmers to understand licenses well. Maybe Linus 
needs to put up a page somewhere detailing, in plain, yet non-legally 
binding, English, what you can and cannot do.
Of course, this wouldn't be even an issue if companies understood how Linux, 
operating system drivers, and computers historically work instead of having 
to screw everything up with all these new ways new ways of screwing people 
with IP rights and unwarrented paranoia.
Side question, would it ever be possible, with GPL code, to make modules and 
plugins of non-GPL compatible origin a license violation? Would this be a 
good idea for the kernel?
