This could explain some odd reports. Amongst the usual causes like flaky 
hardware, kernel misconfiguration and the likes, I encountered some 
people for which IO-APIC support would throw their data away...
Now I always ask the users to recompile without IO-APIC, this usually 
brings other problems (awful ethernet perfs for one user comes to my 
mind) but tends to solve IDE instability.
Until today, I've not a single report where lspci -vxxx highlighted any 
IDE register misconfiguration, AFAICS your code *is* correct Vojtech.
