VMS host-based shadowing is _nice_. :)

Sure --- garbage in, garbage out.  You still aren't proof against an
application failure or against writing the wrong data.  That doesn't
mean that having a redundant storage subsystem is useless: it just means
that such redundancy is only part of the problem.  
btw, Tandem would have caught that scsi error: the existence of such
fault tolerant systems shows that it _is_ possible to guard against
random machine failures.  You are still in trouble if the application is
buggy, of course.
