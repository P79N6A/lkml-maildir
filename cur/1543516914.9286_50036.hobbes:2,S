Richard/Andre:
Would it be benificial to add subsection to the Linux Kernel FAQ
(Under 4.3, I think), something like:
There are some situations that make a kernel oops useless.  The two
most obvious are if your are overclocking your CPU or running
VMWARE's vmmon.  The reason is that overclocking can introduce
random bit errors, while VMWARE's vmmon has the ability to (and
does) change parts of the kernel.  In both cases, data in the
kernel, as reported by the oops, won't be useful.
Ciao!

All parts should go together without forcing.  You must remember that the parts you are reassembling were disassembled by you.  Therefore, if you can't get them together again, there must be a reason.  By all means, do not use a hammer.
