Yes.
Thank you, pointed it out. So I need to select
	1) restric attribute even in mamory
or
	2) pinn inode in memory during mount
		(I think it's not good idea)
I'll revise the patch with 1).

Please confirm my understanding.
You sugessted that symlink should not have ATTR_SYS, to prevent
some over 4KB files created in DOS/WIN to be treated as symlinks?
