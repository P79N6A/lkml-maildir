Good idea, thanks.
I'll try to get all pending ext3/jbd stuff flushed out for 2.6.19-rc1 and
then we can put a plug in it for a while, get the ext4 copy-n-paste sorted
out.  I'd suggest we aim to do this on the day after 2.6.19-rc1 is tagged. 
Or maybe -rc2.  The road to 2.6.19-rc1 is going to be rough - there's an
unusually large amount of work pending, and there is an unusual (although
still small) amount of overlap between the subsystem trees which people
will need to sort out.  Because of this I expect it will take us more than
the nominal two weeks to reach -rc1.
