I added this blacklist rule last spring, but I'm also about to
submit a patch to Linus and Marcelo to remove it and the AL440LX
blacklist rule. You can read the full explanation then; suffice
it to say that using APM's DISPLAY_BLANK with certain graphics
cards causes hangs if the local APIC is enabled. You can just
remove the MS-6163 Pro blacklist rule for now.
