That is what journaling is.  It just depends on exacly what
consistency semantics those checkpoints have: metadata consistency or
full data consistency.  In general, true data consistency can only be
achieved if the application is involved in providing transactional
updates, so unless the application is doing synchronous data writes,
there isn't much point in trying to provide this.

Not really, it is easy to avoid that cost penalty, especially since
most of the recently-journaled data will be in cache anyway (and many
journaling schemes actually enforce that property).
