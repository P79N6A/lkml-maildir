    Hello all :))
    I don't know if /dev/shm (mounted with shmfs or the newer tmpfs)
is needed for proper SYSV IPC operation with newer (2.4.16 and newer)
kernel. Anyone can help?
    Moreover: I want to move my /tmp from disk to tmpfs for speed (I
make a lot of compiling, so I think it would help). Is this a good
idea? If so, what size can be appropriate for a small system that is
not permanently running?
    Thanks a lot for the answers :))
    Raúl
