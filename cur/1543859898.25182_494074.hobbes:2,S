I don't like it, it looks bloated and probably
adds plenty of overhead (similar to the OVZ
implementation where this seems to be taken from)
here are some comments/questions:

why use a spinlock, when we could use atomic
counters?

why do barrier checks with every accounting? 
there are probably a few cases where the
checks could be independant from the accounting

in what cases do we want to cross the barrier?

why do we lock current? it won't go away that
easily, and for switching the bc, it might be 
better to use RCU or a separate lock, no?

also note that certain limits are much more
complicated than the (very simple) file limits
and the code will be called at higher frequency
how to handle requests like:
 try to get as 64 files or as many as available
 whatever is smaller
happy xmas,
