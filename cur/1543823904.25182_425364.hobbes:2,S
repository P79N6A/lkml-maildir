Hi Andrew,
What you are saying indeed makes a lot of sense.
We want to start merging virtualization code some way or another.
Yet, if we merge code step-by-step, we do not want a pile of unused
infrastructure for the beginning, which may happen to be not entirely useful
in the future, or even create obstacles for development.
And in the course of merging, we would like to overcome differences in
opinions of various group, and live happily ever after.
I have a practical proposal.
We can start with presenting and merging the most interesting part, network
containers.  We discuss details, possible approaches, and related subsystems,
until networking is finished to its utmost detail.
This will create an example of virtualization of a non-trivial subsystem,
and we will have to agree on basic principles of virtualization of related
subsystems like proc.
Virtualization of networking presents a lot of challenges and decision-making
points with respect to user-visible interfaces: proc, sysctl, netlink events
(and netlink sockets themselves), and so on.  This code will also become
immediately useful as an improvement over chroot.
I am sure that when we come to a mutually acceptable solution with respect to
networking, virtualization of all other subsystems can be implemented and
merged without many questions.
What do people think about this plan?
Best regards,
Andrey
