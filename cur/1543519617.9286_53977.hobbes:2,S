   Try telling that to Ted T'so.  [He insists that /usr/src/linux/ and
   /usr/src/asm/ must match the currently running kernel.  While I disagree
   with him -- rather strongly -- I do have to admit that there's no simpler
   standard to support novices who need to build kernel modules.]
Wait a minute.  There are there issues here, which are being confused:
	* whether /usr/include/{linux,asm} should refer to the current
		default kernel sources; 
	* whether /usr/src/linux should be a pointer to the current
		default kernel sources; 
	* whether user land programs should include kernel header files
		or not.
(It is assumed to be understood that standalone kernel modules *have* to
refer to the curent default kernel sources.)
Whether or not /usr/include/{linux,asm} should point to the sources of
the current default kernel, and whether or not user land programs should
refer to the kernel sources, hopefully it's painfully obvious to all
concerned why it is extremely useful to have a standardized way to refer
to the current default kernel sources --- and that /usr/src/linux is it.
