Ah, I didn't know that.  (Or more likely, I used to know and have since 
forgotten.)  Thanks for pointing it out.

Yes.  In fact one of them already is, but the other should be too.

Okay.
Come to think of it, the reserved_size value used when a new sg device is
created should also be capped at max_sectors * 512.  Agreed?  I can't see
any reason for ever having a larger buffer -- it would be impossible to
make use of the extra space.
