I've just tried to upgrade the kernel from 2.6.19.9 to 2.6.21.  The
build dies in "make modules" at:
sound/pci/hda/patch_realtek.c:4174: error: array type has incomplete
element type
sound/pci/hda/patch_realtek.c:4175: error: field name not in record or
union initializer
sound/pci/hda/patch_realtek.c:4175: error: (near initialization for
'alc260_cfg_tbl')
sound/pci/hda/patch_realtek.c:4175: error: field name not in record or
union initializer
sound/pci/hda/patch_realtek.c:4175: error: (near initialization for
'alc260_cfg_tbl')
[lots more like the above].
sound/pci/hda/patch_realtek.c: In function 'patch_alc260':
sound/pci/hda/patch_realtek.c:4300: error: 'alc260_models' undeclared
(first use in this function)
sound/pci/hda/patch_realtek.c:4300: error: (Each undeclared identifier
is reported only once
sound/pci/hda/patch_realtek.c:4300: error: for each function it appears
in.)
make[3]: *** [sound/pci/hda/patch_realtek.o] Error 1
make[2]: *** [sound/pci/hda] Error 2
make[1]: *** [sound/pci] Error 2
make: *** [sound] Error 2
I'm on a i686, slackware-11.0 with gcc-4.1.2 box.  Things built fine on
another box (albeit with a different sound card and hence driver
options).
Please CC me on any reply.
