My current policy is that since I could only find 5 real world linux
programs that even call sys_sysctl, that if I find a broken sysctl
binary interface I'm lazy and just remove it.  The only networking one
I know of is radvd.
Added to that I just pushed an autochecking sysctl patch to Andrew
that fails register_sysctl_table if the sysctl table is broken.  And
all of these showed up.  So some fix was needed or things would have
been even worse.
