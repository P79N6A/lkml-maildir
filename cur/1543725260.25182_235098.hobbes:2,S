I noticed that it now fixes swap signatures early, good.

How do you guarantee that while copying pages back and forth,
interrupts are disabled? They have to be, because memory snapshots are
no longer atomic.
In one patch, there's "Invalid partition" message when there's
incorrect signature may be confusing.
Otherwise patches are good. Perhaps it is easier to merge them with
Andrew now and fix remaining few issues with follow up patches?
