Please follow the usual kernel coding style, which would yield something like:
static ssize_t store_auto_brightness(struct device *dev,
		struct device_attribute *attr, const char *buf, size_t count)
{
        int enable, ret;
(affects entire patch).
And please also prepare and maintain a standalone changelog.  The one you have here
is full of references to some long-gone email.  Think: "how will my changelog look
when it is in the main git tree".
Thanks.
