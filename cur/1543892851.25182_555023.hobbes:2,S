The only reason they depend on !HIGHMEM is because handling for
1GB-unaligned splits is unimplemented for PAE, which formerly only
occurred in conjunction with HIGHMEM64G. That said, they were oriented
toward avoiding highmem on laptops, hence the broader !HIGHMEM
constraint. The entire point of the patch is to add an option to use
PAE without highmem for the purposes of NX and secondarily expanded
swapspace, at which point CONFIG_VMSPLIT_[23]G_OPT need some other way
besides !HIGHMEM to exclude PAE, such as specifying !X86_PAE directly.
