Did, no bonus - still floods. Didn't really look like an util problem
anyway, rather like problem in the way the driver uses the syncppp layer
(at least to me, I'm no expert on this field though).
(Had some further test results on what triggered this here but read on...)
UGH. A look in the sources seems to suggest this is just a debugging
message someone didn't bother to hide behind some "debug" or "verbose"
variable but just left there to flood everyone's log files.
Could someone who understands the driver better look at isdn_ppp.c at line
1428 and say if this is just a stupid debug message left there to flood
the kernel log?
