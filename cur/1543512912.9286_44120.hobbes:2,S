Your one is a bug, no way. That is why I didn't bothered to look too much
thorugh the code. It's obvious. You can't depend on reschedule_idle.

The current behaviour is _intentional_ and I implemented it carefully in
June. The algorithm I described in the previous email could be used for
real too. I experimented with it while developing the current code infact.

Wrong. The other fix I mentioned is real but it applyes to CPUs that are
running SCHED_OTHER tasks (but running SCHED_OTHER). The SCHED_OTHER tasks
should be rescheduled immediatly, without my fix instead the scheduler may
force a RT task to wait the SCHED_OTHER task to reschedule. Not a big
issue but it _exists_.
