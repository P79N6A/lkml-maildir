Sounds like a neat system.  I am not sure I would know what to do with
one. :)
It does however sound like the methods used for the Cell based systems
might apply reasonably to it.  The main OS runs on the main CPU, and
executes tasks on the other processors by transfering the task to them
and retreiving the results later when it is ready.
