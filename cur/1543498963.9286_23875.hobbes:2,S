how about ._part1, ._part2 etc...
if you create a file it goes in the primary mount (which does not have a
fugly .dir) but if you want to put it on another partition that has been
"unionized" then 
cp foo /bar/thisdirisunionized/._part1
and it will be copied there
cd /var/this...
ls ._part1
would give a list of all files that are from that partion, (ie a subset of
ls .)
mv ./baz ./._part1/baz would move the file from whatever unioned partition
to that particular unioned partition, it would still appear in the main
dir...
the whole ._part? thing is a kludge, but it does seem to work for every
possible complication/permutation...
now if only I knew how to code this into being ;-)

Today: Lou Grinzo speaks on FS Unions
LG: The recent talk about fs unions (mounting more than one set of
LG: files at the same mount point and merging the dir. contents) is
LG: certainly intriguing.  
LG: 
LG: Would the feature be limited to two mounts per point?  Would it
LG: only allow mounts from the same drive, same partition, same
LG: locale (meaning local vs. networked), or from any valid drives?
LG: 
LG: How would file creations be handled (assuming all unioned file 
LG: space is R/W)?  I imagine there would have to be some very 
LG: specific rules governing this, e.g. the first mount is considered the 
LG: "primary" one and gets all file creations, barring any override from 
LG: the user/programmer.  (And no, I haven't considered exactly how 
LG: such an override should be done.)  Or does the location with the 
LG: most free space get the new file?  Or would file creations be 
LG: prevented entirely?  (That would certainly clean things up for the 
LG: implementation, but it could create severe usability problems, 
LG: so is probably not feasible.)
LG: 
LG: To create a fully-realized implementation, would there have
LG: to be modifications to commands or facilities to take into account
LG: or exploit the fs unions?  If so, this might be a way for some others 
LG: to contribute to the effort and produce a better integration of the 
LG: feature into the Linux environment.
