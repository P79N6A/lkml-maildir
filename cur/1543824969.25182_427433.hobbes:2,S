Hi,
I recently started running linux on a new x60 thinkpad and started
noticing really poor network performance with this kernel.  I saw some
archived threads from a while back saying this could be related to
conntracking.  Disabled that (rmmod ip_conntrack) did not fix the
problem.  I also tried disabling tso but that didn't have any effect
either.  I can reproduce the problem when connected to a 100Mbps switch
(I don't have a GigE network to test this with).
This laptop uses the Intel 82573L (PCI-Express) chip.  I'd be glad to
assist with any toubleshooting/testing w.r.t this.  I am not subscribed
to the list, so please cc me on any replies.
Thank you,
Aravind.
