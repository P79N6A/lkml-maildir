Merged: Per-process namespaces, late-boot cleanups.
Ready: switch to ->get_super() as primary file_system_type method.
Ready: ->getattr() handling and changes of ->setattr()/->permission()
prototypes.
Pending: proper UFS fixes, ext2 cleanups and locking
changes.
Pending: per-mountpoint read-only, union-mounts and unionfs.
Pending: lifting limitations on mount(2)
In progress: killing kdev_t for block devices (switch to struct block_device *)
Started: UMSDOS rewrite (the damn thing blocks struct inode trimming)
Planned: new mount API.
