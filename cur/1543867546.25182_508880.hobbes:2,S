it needs rediffing pretty much every time the cryptoapi changes.
On a good month that means once per point release, otherwise...
One argument in its favour is aparently Red Hat isn't the only vendor
with something like this.  I've not investigated it, but I hear rumours
that suse has something similar.  Having everyone using the same code
would be a win for obvious reasons.
