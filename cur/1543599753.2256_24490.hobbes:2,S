The problem really can't be solved with macros. Here is a little script
that you can run, which shows that some versions of gcc don't even
perform macro-expansion correctly.
SNIP-------
#!/bin/bash
cat >/tmp/xxx.c <<EOF
#include <stdio.h>
#undef MIN
#define MIN(a, b) ((unsigned int)(a) < (unsigned int)(b) ? (a) : (b)) 
int main(void);
int main() {
   int i;
   unsigned int j;
   i = j = 0;
   printf("%08x\n", MIN(i, j));
   return 0;
}
EOF
gcc -Wall -Wsign-compare -c -o /dev/null /tmp/xxx.c
rm -f /tmp/xxx.c
gcc --version
SNIP------
Here's a "good" execution:

# sh -v xxx.sh
#!/bin/bash
cat >/tmp/xxx.c <<EOF
gcc -Wall -Wsign-compare -c -o /dev/null /tmp/xxx.c
rm -f /tmp/xxx.c
gcc --version
egcs-2.91.66
# exit

Here's a "bad" execution:
Script started on Thu Aug 30 16:55:30 2001
[root@blackhole /root]# sh -v xxx.sh
#!/bin/bash
cat >/tmp/xxx.c <<EOF
gcc -Wall -Wsign-compare -c -o /dev/null /tmp/xxx.c
/tmp/xxx.c: In function `main':
/tmp/xxx.c:9: warning: signed and unsigned type in conditional expression
rm -f /tmp/xxx.c
gcc --version
2.96
[root@blackhole /root]# exit

This version was shipped with RedHat 7.x
As you can see, the casts are !!!IGNORED!!! in gcc 2.96.
The min() macro is not really used for the mathematical min, anywhere
I've found it in the kernel. It's used as a whatever_will_fit() macro
where the writer wanted to prevent a buffer overflow. In these cases,
the compare should always be unsigned, even if the input values are
signed integers. It is possible to have a buffer of 0xffffffff bytes
in length and certainly 2 bytes will fit into it. Because of the
overloading of common functions to return -1 and other signed values,
it is commonplace to use signed integers to store large values without
regard for sign. Whether or not this is a design error is moot. It's
done "everywhere".
An attempt to discover signed compare problems by redefining a common
macro is doomed to fail. No matter what you do, it can be shown to
be wrong. I suggest we just leave the damn thing alone and fix any
bugs found in the normal way, i.e., "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Cheers,

    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
