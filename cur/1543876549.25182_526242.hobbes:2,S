Subject: [PATCH] (re)register_binfmt returns with -EBUSY

When a binary format is unregistered and re-registered,
register_binfmt fails with -EBUSY. The reason is that
unregister_binfmt does not set fmt->next to NULL, and seeing
(fmt->next != NULL), register_binfmt fails with -EBUSY.
One can find his way around by explicitly setting fmt->next to NULL
after unregistering, but that is kind of unclean (one should better be
using only the interfaces, and not the interal members, isn't it?)
Attached one-liner can fix it (for 2.6.20).
