The documentation for this driver seems to be old in v2.4.0-test11-pre5:
--------------------
You need to build a new kernel to use this device, even if you want to
use a loadable module.  
Apply the patch to a 2.2.x kernel:
# cd linux
# patch -p1 <smart2.patch
---------------------
Later, there is a section:
-----------------
Booting:
--------
You'll need to use a modified lilo if you want to boot from a disk 
array.
Its simply a version of lilo with some code added to tell it how to
understand Compaq diskarray devices.
-----------------
Is this information still correct? Can't I boot from a Compaq disk 
array with a recent lilo (V 21 from SuSE 7.0)? I would need that 
feature soon and wonder where to get such a special lilo from.
Thanks in advance, and answers please per private mail, as I am not 
subscribed to this list.
