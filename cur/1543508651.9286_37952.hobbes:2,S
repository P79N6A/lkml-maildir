Hi All,
 I have just fitted a second processor to our machine (replacing one that
got damaged a while ago). I am now trying to run Linux in SMP mode. I can
compile
and boot the kernel with the SMP option turned on in menuconfig. However
when I try
and load any modules there are a number of unresolve symbols.
This include
__global_cli
tqueue_lock
__global_save_flags
How can I compile in SMP and have the modules work?
Thanks in advance,
Nicholas Waltham
