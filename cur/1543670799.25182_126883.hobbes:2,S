truncate always used to be such a PITA in the VM. And so few code depends
on it doing the right thing to vmas. Which i claim to not be the right
thing at all.
is anything forcing us to fixing up mappings during a truncate? What we
need is just for the FS to recognize pages behind end-of-inode to still
potentially exist after truncation, if those areas were mapped before the
truncation. Apps that do not keep uptodate with truncaters can get
out-of-date data anyway, via read()/write() anyway. Are there good
arguments to be this strict across truncate()? We sure could make it safe
even thought it's not safe currently.
