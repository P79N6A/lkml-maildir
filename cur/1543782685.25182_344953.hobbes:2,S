Its the overhead of using registers to pass parameters, performing a 
function call that does nothing etc. A waste of computing resources. All 
of that unconditionally in a performance critical execution path that 
is executed a gazillion times for an optional feature that I frankly 
find not useful at all and that is disabled by default.
