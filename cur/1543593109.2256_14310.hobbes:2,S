Could you compile uhci as a module, set the configuration to MPS1.4 and
find out with which interrupt line setting it works.
I'd try both
setpci -s 00:07.2 INTERRUPT_LINE=13
setpci -s 00:07.2 INTERRUPT_LINE=3
[even if 13 works, please try 03 as well. 13 is hexadecimal==19]
The via ac97 sound driver contains an irq fixup for this problem. Either
a similar fixup is necessary in the uhci driver, or the fixup from the
ac97 driver could be moved to the pci-quirks and applied to all devices
in the southbridge.
