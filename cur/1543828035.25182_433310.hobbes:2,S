At least three different sets of people want to extend the syscall
tracing.  Jeff Dike posted a patch that lets you supply a bitmask of
syscalls to trace.  Renzo Davoli posted one that lets you decide, after
trapping entrance to a syscall, whether to skip the trap that would
normally be done on exit from the same call.  Charles P. Wright also
had a similar patch.  I think this needs to be done at the utrace
level -- a tracing engine couldn't add that on its own (could it?)
Renzo Davoli also posted a patch to allow "batching" of ptrace requests
and Systemptap really needs this, too.  AFAICT this can be done by writing
a custom engine.
And BTW patches 1 and 2 never made it to the list.  The ones on your
server (
http://redhat.com/~roland/utrace/
) don't apply cleanly due to
whitespace damage but that can be fixed by stripping trailing whitespace
from the kernel files patch(1) complains about.
