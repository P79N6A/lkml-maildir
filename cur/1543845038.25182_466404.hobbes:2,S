You mean something like this?
#define MARK(n,v1,v2,v3) asm ("__mark_" #n ": nop" ::  \
                              "X" (v1), "X" (v2), "X" (v3))
I haven't been able to get gcc to emit any better debuginfo for
parameters pseudo-passed like this. 
(I've tested such a marker inserted into an inner loop of dhrystone.
It was compiled with "-ggdb -O3".  Neither gdb nor systemtap could
resolve the same values/symbols being passed as MARK() arguments,
though at least the breakpoint address was nicely marked.)
