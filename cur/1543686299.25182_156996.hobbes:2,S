Yes there are already a number of systems which exhibit this problem (see

Sorry, yeah i meant device scalability essentially, the ability to plug in 
a fair amount of these and other devices into the same system. The per cpu 
IDT route is also worthwhile following a bit later on. I've already 
written something along the lines of a per node IDT (you could make the 
granularity per cpu of course) if you're interested you can have a look 
here 
http://www.osdl.org/projects/numaqhwspprt/results/patch-numaq-highirq10
 it 
also has a companion patch to dynamically allocate the irq_desc's which 
applies on top of it 
http://function.linuxpower.ca/patches/patch-dynirq-wli
But back to the subject, your patch looks good, i'll test it for 
regression (no MSI devices but regression testing is just as important) 
when you next post.
Thanks!
