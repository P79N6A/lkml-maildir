NBD and iSCSI are two examples that come to mind. Error-handling on the
SCSI stack might get you into trouble too (though you'd probably lose
there anyway). I suspect LVM might need to alloc memory to back snapshots,
but I haven't looked at that. I won't even mention loopback.
But for all the boring scenarios, you should be fine.
