Ok, now I get it. But A) you *generally* aren't going to be restoring just
one and B) if you're using windows and can use the long filename, then the
short filename probably isn't really going to matter. This is really the
way vfat works - I sure wouldn't trust the short version in a case like
that to stay the same, and you could get the same problem moving around
files in windows. So, if we're going to fix this problem that M$ created
with their giant kludge of a "filesystem", we shouldn't mess up Linux's
filesystem to do it, and we definately shouldn't mess with the tools (tar,
cpio, etc.) to do it. If someone is *really* that concerned about the
short name changing, it should be fixed with special backup tools. You
probably wouldn't need to mess with the kernel at all, just have the
backup program generate and store the short version the vfat filesystem is
backed up.
