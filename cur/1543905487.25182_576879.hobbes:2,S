Subject: [PATCH] Fallout from "Remove fs.h from mm.h" patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/30/283

While I was busy compile-testing my patch, ENOSYS sneaked into pm.h leading to some
compile-breakages mostly on ia64 and some mips configs.
