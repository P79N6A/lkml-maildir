In this case, what good is the sleep_on stuff? Wouldn't the cleaner
solution be to:
1) add an option to signal the wait queue in the wake_up function, if the
queue is empty (or perhaps even keep it signalled, even if there are
queued tasks).
2) for the sleep_on function, add an option to be immediately awoken if
entering an already signalled queue (and clear the signal).
This would hide all the ugliness, no? And prevent a lot of incorrect
drivers being written, just because some folks didn't catch on to this
race (e.g. Dick Johnson's posting).
