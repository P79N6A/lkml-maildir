It gets worse when code authors begin to use
typedef struct { ... } MYSTRUCT, *PMYSTRUCT, **PPMYSTRUCT;
Most certainly you will run into "passing argument from incompatible 
pointer"[1] and "request for member ■a■ in something not a structure or 
union"[2] and "invalid type argument of ■->■"[3] (BTW I hate gcc using 
Unicode chars in its output which are not displayed in the console):
struct foo {
    int bar;
} ST, *PST;
void foobar(ST a) {  // [1]
    a->bar = 1;
    foobar2(a);  // [3]
}
void foobar2(PST a) {  // [2]
    a.bar = 1;
}
So I much rather like to see all the 'funky stars' (struct foo *) in the 
parameter list, instead of trying to keep track of how many of them a 
PST carries.
