for fairness reasons if there are multiple tasks, I want to wake them
all and let the others be able to eat requests before the first
allocates all the batch_sectors. So the current code is fine and
batch_sectors still works fine with multiple tasks queued in the
waitqueue, it still makes sense to wake more than one of them at the
same time to improve cpu utilization (regardless they're different
tasks, for istance we take less frequently the waitqueue spinlocks
etc..).
What we disabled is only the batch_sectors in function of the single
task, so if for example there's just 1 single task, we could let it go,
but it's quite a special case, if for example there would be two tasks,
we wouldn't want to let them go ahead (unless we can distributed exactly
count/2 requests to each task w/o reentering into __get_request_wait
that's unlikely). So the current code looks ok to me with the
wake_up_nr to take advantage of the batch_sectors against different
tasks, still w/o penalizing fariness.
