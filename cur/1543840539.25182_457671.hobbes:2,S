I'll add a vote for this.  Not sure if the user base is large enough
to justify it being added to the mainline kernel, but Computer
Forensic professionals often need to image computers with Raid setups.
 (image == dd copy of logical volume)
For many configurations, the current choices are sub-optimal.  It
would be nice to have a boot disk that could capture any and all raid
volumes.
FYI: There are already many linux boot CDs that specifically target
Computer Forensics tasks, so there is a bigger user community than
many might assume.  Examples incude SPADA (law enforcement only),
smart, Farmer Dude's boot cd, FCCU GNU/Linux Forensic Boot CD, Helix,
Penguin Sleuth.
All of the above would benefit from a generic, but slow raid driver.
For this use it would be great if both real raid and fake raid were
supported.  Not sure if fake raid comes with int13 support or not.
