__attribute__((noreturn)) may do other things besides suppress the "no
return from non-void function" warning.  The gcc manual gives two
additional reasons for it:
          void fatal () __attribute__ ((noreturn));
     The `noreturn' keyword tells the compiler to assume that `fatal'
     cannot return.  It can then optimize without regard to what would
     happen if `fatal' ever did return.  This makes slightly better
     code.  More importantly, it helps avoid spurious warnings of
     uninitialized variables.
Thus it is not a workaround, it is a way to give the optimizer extra
information.  Standard C cannot express this assertion, to my
knowledge, so if you stick with ISO you get suboptimal code.
From another viewpoint: the 'return 0', though syntactically correct,
would be misleading -- it will never be executed and we know it.  Using
__attribute__((noreturn)) reflects reality, which is usually a good
thing for coding style.  (Whoops, I said "coding style".(: )

Sorry, I don't follow your point here..
