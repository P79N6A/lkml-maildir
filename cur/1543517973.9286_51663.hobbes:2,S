        ^^^^^^^^^^^
There's your problem.  The number of cylinders is here is causing problems, as
it is clamped to 2^14.  Most BIOSes let you lower this number by increasing the
number of phony heads to 255.  With heads set to 255, your CHS values would be
1650/255/63, which the BIOS and FDISK (and thence the kernel) will understand.
Try playing around with the disk geometry parameters in your BIOS to change the
large/normal/lba setting until you achieve those values.   (But note: if you
have Windoze installed, you'll need to back up your disk and reinstall, as it
changes the mappings!)
