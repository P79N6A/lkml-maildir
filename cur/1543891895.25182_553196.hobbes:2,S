A matter of opinion :)  I tend to think goto is special enough to
warrant column 1 unconditionally.  It is special, so it draws additional
attention over and above case labels.
I and others have been tripped up when programmers "hide" goto
statements among regular statements.
IMO goto warrants a big flashing "notice me" sign.
