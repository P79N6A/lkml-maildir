POSIX is not a trademark.  The name refers to an IEEE/ISO/IEC
standard.
You don't *have* to run any tests to claim that Linux (+ libc +
utilities) conforms to POSIX.  But if you don't run a suitable test
suite, how can you be confident that it does conform to POSIX?
(The origin of the term POSIX may be a surprise to some.  See
