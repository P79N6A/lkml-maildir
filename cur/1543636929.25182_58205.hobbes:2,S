Yesterday i posted a message about troubles compiling 2.2.20RAID or
2.4.18/2.4.19rc1/2.4.19rc1aa2 kernel for an Alpha PC164LX.
I got a tip to use gcc-3.1 but i didn't find it from debian-trees,
so i used the latest 3.0 (gcc-3.0.4) compiler, and tried again.
2.2.20 w/RAID doesn't compile, so doesn't aa2-patched 2.4.19rc1.
I tried 2.4.18 using gcc-3.0.4 and it did compile and almost work.
I was able to make raid-1 /dev/md0, mke2fs -j for it and mount it
without any errors, but when i tried to use it, got crash.
Then i downloaded the latest 2.4-patch, 2.4.19-rc3 and compiled it
again. That went successfully and again it does allow me to create
raid, make filesystem and mount it, but using will crash.
Couple of minutes ago, i make very interesting notification.
This may be a reason, but how can it be solved:

The core shows a bit huge :-/ Four terabytes... huh.
What's up next?!
