This is my words....
Tape drives have a well known and simple and standardized interface since many
years (> 40). There exist ioctl()s to do anything you like.
CD/DVD writing ist still constantly evolving, so you cannot have it in the 
kernel.
BTW: I am strongly against any list of "safe commands" as this would only make 
things more complicated. Things that control security should be ket simple.
