i dont think we want to balance with that high of a frequency on NUMA
Opteron. These tunes were for testing only.
i'm dusting off the balance-on-clone patch right now, that should be the
correct solution. It is based on a find_idlest_cpu() function which
searches for the least loaded CPU and checks whether we can do passive
load-balancing to it. Ie. it's yet another balancing point in the
scheduler, _not_ some balancing logic change.
