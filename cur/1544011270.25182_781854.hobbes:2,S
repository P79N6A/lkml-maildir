Yes, w1_process_search_command() calls w1_search_devices() with the
w1_send_slave() callback which is invoked each time new slave is
detected. w1_send_slave() checks if amount of available data is enough
to store additional ID and sends message otherwise. The last message is
being sent with the flag indicating that, and it is sent no matter if
there were some slave devices found or not.
