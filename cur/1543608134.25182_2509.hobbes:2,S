Are you sure?

Doesn't work - you're piping the stdin there, not stderr as per my
example above. AFAIK, there's no way to pipe stderr without also piping
stdout, hence this sort of solution just doesn't work.
AFAICS, there is no sane alternative to /dev/null in userspace.

How does zerofill know when to stop writing zeros out? After all, if it
doesn't write enough out for the head call, then it's no longer an
equivalent to /dev/zero, and it could easily be called with just about
ANY positive number of bytes, including an infinite number, as in...
	zerofill | tr '\0' '@' > /dev/ttyS1
...which sends an infinite stream of 0x40 bytes to the serial port.
However...
	zerofill 750M  > /tmp/img.cd
	zerofill 1440k > /tmp/img.floppy
...would be a reasonable userspace equivalent to examples (2) and (3)
respectively, so that certainly could be done in userspace.

Which of my examples is this an equivalent to? I don't recognise it.

I'll leave that to somebody with more unwanted time than I have...
Best wishes from Riley.
