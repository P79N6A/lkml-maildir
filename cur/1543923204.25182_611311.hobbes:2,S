Ok, I'll change those over to container_of().

As far as I can tell, yes.

Yep, I'll change that.

It is intended to be used by ColdFire platforms that want early
boot console support. The old driver (drivers/serial/mcfserial.c)
sort of gave you this for free with its fixed resourcing.
I have changes to the ColdFire based m68knommu systems to
use a platform model at init, and this is used there.
Thanks.

Greg
