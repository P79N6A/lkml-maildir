	It seems to be a generic 2.2.14 (and 2.2.15pre5) problem.
	I was running into lost interrupts with my SCSI disks (aicxxxx
driver) when I accessed a 2nd hard disk.  Tried it with 2.2.5pre5 as 
well.  I couldn't even make it 1/4th the way through a mkfs on sdb1 or
sdc1 (both empty HD's).  I also tried the 'nosmp' option on bootup, that
had no effect either.  Went back to a 2.2.13 kernel this morning --
works fine.
	Sooooo....something broke between 2.2.13 and 2.2.14 :-(.
