I was a design decision not to parse comments.
Tradeoff between speed and accurateness.
And usually CONFIG_SYMBOLs referred in comments are also used.
The mis-behaviour is not documented in other places than in fixdep
itself - and that's not a place I expect people to look anyway.
If I at some point in time manage to convince myself to write a
how-to-compile-the-kernel I will try to include a section of
known shortcoming. This being one of them.
