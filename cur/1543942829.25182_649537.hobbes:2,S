Well, maybe for connection establishment path it is not, but it is
absolutely the case in the sending and sometimes receiving pathes for 4k
stacks. The main problem is that bugs which happen because of stack
overflow are so much obscure, that it is virtually impossible to detect
where overflow happend. 'Debug stack overflow' somehow does not help to
detect it.
Usually there is about 1-1.5 kb of free stack for each process, so this
change will cut one third of the free stack, getting into account that
something can store ipv6 addresses on stack too, this can end up badly.

One can reorganize syncookie support to work with request hash tables
too, so that we could allocate per hash-bucket space and use it as a
scratchpad for cookies.
