A couple.  If Andrew is willing to pick up the mempool patches I posted an
hour or so ago, there will be only 4 mempool users that aren't using a
common mempool allocator.  Regardless of whether that happens, there are
only a few users that aren't slab based:
   1) mm/highmem.c - page based allocator
   2) drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c - calls alloc_skb(), which does
      eventually end up making a slab allocation
   3) drivers/md/raid1.c & raid10.c - easily the biggest mempool_alloc
      functions in the kernel.  Non-trivial.
   4) drivers/md/dm-crypt.c - the driver you mentioned, also using a page
      allocator
So we could possibly get away with a reservation scheme, but a couple users
would be non-trivial to fixup.
