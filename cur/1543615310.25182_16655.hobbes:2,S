Oh please don't inject (more) noise into this1 Doing ANYTHING involves
running kerel space code somewhere. It is still possible to talk
meaningfully about:
	- opening a publicly readable file in /proc to get some info,
	  which will run some kernel code (which can presumably be trusted;
	  if you don't trust your kernel you have a serious problem)
    versus
	- running a setuid binary (however audited) to get the info; said
	  binary may have bugs, security holes, race conditions etc; it may be
	  hacked post boot (no so easy to do to the live kernel image), etc
Further, binaries which grovel in /dev/kmem tend to have to be kept in sync
with the kernel; in-kernel code is fundamentally in sync.
