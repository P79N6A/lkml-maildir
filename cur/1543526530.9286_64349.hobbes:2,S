Subject: spin lock contention: lru_list lock

I tried sgi's lockmeter with 2.3.46, and during a simple
	make -j4 dep
I get extremely long hold times for the lru_list lock:
sync_buffers(): up to 14 milliseconds, average 12 milliseconds. [called
10 times per second.]
__invalidate_buffers(): up to 8 milliseconds, average 7 milliseconds.[
called ~4.5 times/sec]
I assume that everything is cached:
* 192 MB memory.
* /proc/meminfo: Cached 122 MB
* slabinfo: dentry_cache: 17705 entries, inode cache 15174 entries,
buffer heads: 108189 entries.
Is it possible to optimize sync_buffers()/__invalidate_buffers()
further? I assume that with 1 GB memory, the hold times could become a
problem for a huge fileserver.

P.S.: some good news: except do_close [up to 34 milliseconds], noone
else owns a spinlock for more than 3 milliseconds.
