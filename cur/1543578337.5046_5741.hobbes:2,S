I dug up an old amd 386 and started compiling kernels for it with gcc 2.95.2:
2.4.0 : doesn't boot, same symptoms as you, Robert, so you're not imagining 
	things :-)
2.2.19pre6 : compiles, boots and runs poifectly
2.3.51 : doesn't compile
2.3.99-pre1 : hrm, *cough*
2.3.99-pre2 : *tsjoum*
2.3.39: compiles and boots okay
here is where I got bored :-)
okay, anyone, which 2.3.x kernels should compile okay ?
With kind regards,
Sven
