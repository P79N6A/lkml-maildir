The piece of code below was intended for that. I agree with Rusty's
comment, BUG() is too strong for that case. 
#if 0 /* FIXME: Grab cpu_lock, return error on this case. --RR */
	new_mask &= cpu_online_map;
	if (!new_mask)
		BUG();
#endif
Anyhow, changing the new_mask in this way is BAD, because the masks
are inherited. So when more CPUs come online, they remain excluded
from the mask of the process and it's children.
The fix suggested in the comments still has to be done...

Erich
