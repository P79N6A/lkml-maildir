Still, even with NOPAGE_REFAULT or the equivalent with the new fault() code,
in the case we need to take this route, (and it looks like we won't have 
to),
I guess we still need to restart from find_vma() in the fault()/nopage() 
handler to make sure the VMA is still present. The object mutex need to 
be dropped as well to avoid deadlocks. Sounds complicated.
