Hi,
  I am quite new to linux kernel build procedure and please forgive me
if my question is too _easy_.
  From what I know I can change different parameters to build kernel by
make xconfig/make menuconfig/make config.
  The above proesses will generate different settings in .config and
autoconf.h. Now I want to build my loadable kernel module against
different kernel settings ( like CPU type, SMP support or not and so..
). Is this possible to automate all of the steps involed?
  I found out that 'make dep' does not update *.ver in
./include/linux/modules/ and I have to use make mrproper but it will
delete everthing..
  Or, I should build a generic module that can run on different kernel
settings? I am quite confuse and hope someone can give me a hand on
this.
TIA.
- Joe
