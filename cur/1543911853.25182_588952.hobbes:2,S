On a totally unrelated issue:
While looking at the history in gitk and gitweb etc shows these commit 
ID's as nice hyperlinks, I really think it's nicer for everybody if the 
commit is also described with its "headline", so that non-git users (or 
even git users, when just using "git log" or similar) at least can grep or 
google for it.
So when writing descriptions, I would prefer it if people wrote them 
something like
   Commit 61ec7567db103d537329b0db9a887db570431ff4 ('ACPI: boot correctly 
   with "nosmp" or "maxcpus=0"') broke maxcpus parsing on x86[-64] ...
so that it gets both the exact commit naming and the nice hyperlinks where 
appropriate *and* it ends up being more useful even without the links.
Yes, it's redundant information, but since we have the useful one-line 
descriptions, it's generally a good idea. And I really do think that it 
tends to make the explanations read better too.
For example, in this example, I think it really made it more clear what 
kind of change had caused the breakage. Maybe that's not always true, but 
I suspect it's true most of the time.
I'll fix it up manually (I often do), but I thought I'd just mention this 
stylistic issue.
