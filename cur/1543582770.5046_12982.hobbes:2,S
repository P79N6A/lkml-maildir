One important question as to the disk format is whether the "." and ".."
interception by VFS is a new phenomenon in 2.4 or if this also happened
in 2.2?  If so, then having these entries on disk will be important
for 2.2 compatibility, and you don't want to have different on-disk formats
between 2.2 and 2.4.
Cheers, Andreas
