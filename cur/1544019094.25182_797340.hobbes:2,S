I didn't know about uninitialized_var(), thanks for the hint.
My experience with these warnings is that, in many cases, it is
possible to write the code differently so that it is clear to the
compiler that the variable is never used uninitialized. In some cases,
doing so also makes the code easier to read for humans and less likely
to break in the future.
Of course, in some cases the problem is simply that the compiler is too
stupid to understand even simple things, but in other cases these
warnings might be a good opportunity to rewrite the code in a way that
is easier to understand.
