Can't say I agree with this layering distinction.
It's been some years that I've felt that most 'logical volume
management' really belongs in the filesystem.
Why have a dm that chops devices up in to segments and assembles them to
look like a big device, only to have that big device chopped up and
presented as files.  Seems like double handling to me.
With checksums - the filesystem is in a better position to:
 - be selective about what is checksummed - no point checksumming
   blocks that aren't part of any file.  Some blocks (highlevel
   metadata) might always be checksummed, while other blocks
   (regular data) might not if a 'fast' option was chosen.
 - record the checksum somewhere easily accessible.  The dm layer
   could do little better than store a block of checksums for every 10
   blocks of data.  A filesystem can store checksums with indexing
   information, or ensure that checksums for consecutive blocks in a
   file are stored together, even if the blocks cannot be.
I think that for a filesystem that makes heavy use of trees to find
things, it makes a lot of sense to checksum and replicate the upper
levels of the tree, while checksumming and replicating lower levels
has a very different cost/benefit tradeoff.   These distinctions are
easy to make in a filesystem, and hard to make in a block device.
To my mind, the only thing you should put between the filesystem and
the raw devices is RAID (real-raid - not raid0 or linear).
