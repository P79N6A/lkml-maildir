Hi Christoph,
I see you've already done this.  I was about to work on it
tonight (Monday night my time).  Oh well...thanks.

Yeah, but I don't like duplicating code either.
More to find (or miss) whenever global changes are needed.

I was concerned about the ordering of procswaps_init() and
proc_root_init().  What happens if procswaps_init() is
called before proc_root_init() is called?
Or is there initcall ordering that prevents that?
If so, where is it?
