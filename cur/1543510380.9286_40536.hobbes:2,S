Why does Linux 2.2(.12) swap memory for "running" programs to disk, in
favor of disk cache? (The programs were X apps, in sleep state, but
hadn't been so for more than a few seconds.)
What happens is that when you move the X mouse cursor again, there's a
~ .5s delay when kernel reloads disk-swap memory. Very annoying,
especially since there's only 5 MB of program memory, and the other
123 MB is used for cached disk data (128 MB total on this system).
Output from `free' during the copying:
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        128112     126432       1680       9144       2620     115708
-/+ buffers/cache:       8104     120008
Swap:        80288      12192      68096
