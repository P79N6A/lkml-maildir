All of the hot path RNG stuff can and should be moved to userspace.
Right now the path is
	kernel /dev/hwrandom -> rngd -> add /dev/random entropy
All three current vendors shown in hw_random.c are doable in userspace. 
  Intel uses MMIO, AMD uses PIO, and VIA uses a specialized CPU 
instruction.  As HPA mentioned, you can use the MSR driver for control.
Patches welcome!
