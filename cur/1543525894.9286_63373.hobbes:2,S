	Ya know, I've been finding it rather interesting that all the
tech that IBM/DEC developed for their mainframe lines back in the
1960s/1970s is coming back to haunt us...
	IO Channel		->		STP
	IBM 3270		->		HTML
	  (page based 
	   interaction)
	Mainframe/Terminal	->	Server/Thin Client
	Clustering		->		Clustering 	;^)
	I have this crazy feeling that the ``PC Revolution'' will be viewed 
in the grand scheme of things as the ``What the HECK were we thinking?'' 
score. (You know, score=20 years, as in `four score and ten years ago')
	And now that IBM has System 390s running Linux... ...shiver...
Was that a ghost of a MVS programmer spinning in his grave?
