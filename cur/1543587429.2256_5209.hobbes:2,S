While I operate my own mail server at home and work, and agree that having
logs for the entire transaction is great, I may have a solution for you:
Setup your email program to bcc to an address that is also on the internet
(bigfoot.com is what I use) and have it forward to your account at the
university.  That way, when it comes back you'll have a good idea that the
other recipient on the internet received the message also.
