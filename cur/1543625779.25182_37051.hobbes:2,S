If we don't mix page sizes, but just increase the default from
4k, does this still add a lot of complexity in your eyes? I can't
see why it would ... ?

I believe one of the traditional problems stated for this case is
the amount of virtual address space taken up by all the struct pages
for a machine with large amounts of memory (32-64Gb). At the moment, 
the obvious choice of architecture is still 32 bit, but maybe AMD 
Hammer will fix this ... Unless someone has a plan to move all those
up into highmem as well ....
