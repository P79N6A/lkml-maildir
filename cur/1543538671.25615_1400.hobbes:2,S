spin_lock_irqsave() stores the previous interrupt enabled flag _before_
it spins, thus you must at least replace cpu_flag with a per-cpu array.
And note that this won't work on sparc, afaik the sparc cpu stores a
combination of the stack pointer and the interrupt flag in cpu_flag -->
crash during spin_unlock_irqrestore().
