The idea in the change was to be able to override NLM_PROGRAM with
another definition (from our slightly customized build system), so that
the kernel never tries to register port 100021.
We understand that if all mounts are with 'nolock' this wouldn't happen,
and indeed, we configured our mounts that way, but we want to protect
ourself from some innocent mounter that doesn't know/care about NLM,
doesn't use 'nolock' and could cause the kernel to take away our port.
This of course happened in real life.
If such patch would be accepted, it could save some time to anyone who
tries to run user mode NLM server, but it's pretty esoteric, so maybe
this discussion is enough to document the issue.

The client needs to have lockd running (as service 100021) in order to
allow the NSM daemon to notify it of server reboots.
