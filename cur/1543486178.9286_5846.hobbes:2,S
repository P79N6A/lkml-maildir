Hi all,
I'm using an ac patch to get support of my sym53c416 (thanks Alan) and my
scanner now works nicely.  I also have my zip attached to my aha152x.
Currently the Adaptec loads dynamically via kmod and the Symbios is loaded
at boot in rc.local.  I'm interested in loading them both dynamically.  In
conf.modules, I alias scsihostadapter to the aha152x. I've tried adding the
sym53c416 on both the same line and a new line and it has not seemed to
work. Is it possible to have both modules load auto-dynamically? The current
setup I am using is acceptable for me, but I am curious. I have yet to find
a solution in any FM I have R'd.
-Eric ;-)
