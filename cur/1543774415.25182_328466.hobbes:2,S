NLKD's architecture supports pluggable remote agents that talk directly
to hardware.  For remote debugging we currently we only have support 
for the serial port, but supporting other device types should be
fairly straightforward and doing so is on the todo list.
The main effort it is in writing the driver which must operate outside 
kernel context.  As we start to see support for additional hardware in remote 
debug agents we may spend the time to further abstract the remote 
debug protocol stack support away from the hardware driver.  
This architecture will be explained in our OLS paper.
In the mean time someone could simply take the RDA serial port code
and replace it with support for other hardware (NIC or whatever) and get 
the desired results.  
Again this sort of thing is on our todo list and we would really appreciate 
help from persons familiar with writing drivers for various device types 
to help jump start this.
