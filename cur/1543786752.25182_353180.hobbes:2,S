Subject: [PATCH][Fix] Prevent swsusp from corrupting page translation tables during resume on x86-64

Hi,
The following patch fixes Bug #4959.  It creates temporary page translation
tables located in the page frames that are not overwritten by swsusp while copying
the image.
The temporary page translation tables are generally based on the existing ones
with the exception that the mappings using 4KB pages are replaced with the
equivalent mappings that use 2MB pages only.  The temporary page tables are
only used for copying the image.
Please consider for applying.
Greetings,
Rafael
