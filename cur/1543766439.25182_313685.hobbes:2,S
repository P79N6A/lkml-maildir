Ah, apparently it is sufficient:
Linus:
“Just signing the commit is indeed sufficient to just say "I trust 
this commit". But I essentially what to also say what I trust it 
_for_ as well.”
So this would work for commit objects.
It would also work for tag objects, if you pointed people at the signature
object rather than the actual tag object.
