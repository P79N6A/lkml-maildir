This fixed for me too with kernel 2.6.19.1. On my machine, every second
trial to unplug the second CPU core were generating OOPS, and breaking
hibernation. I've opened a bugzilla (#7786).
There is a remain stuff to be fixed, related to cpuhotplug: kernel with
debug options enabled shows that there is a circular locking dependency
(
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=10020&action=view
):
 =======================================================
[ INFO: possible circular locking dependency detected ]
2.6.19.1 #1
-------------------------------------------------------
stress/5670 is trying to acquire lock:
 (cpu_bitmask_lock){--..}, at: [<ffffffff8015af7d>] lock_cpu_hotplug+0x6d/0x80
but task is already holding lock:
 (workqueue_mutex){--..}, at: [<ffffffff8014962f>] workqueue_cpu_callback+0x16f/0x2d0
which lock already depends on the new lock.
This happens the first time I do:
echo 0 >/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
on an AMD/64 dual core.
It would be interesting to have this patch also applied to -stable.
Cheers, 
Mauro.
