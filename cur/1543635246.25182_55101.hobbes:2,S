This removes the test, and also fixes the function declarations ( changes them
from 'function blah ()' to just 'blah ()' ) to make it more of a POSIX sh
script.  As I put in my other reply (started another thread...problems
explained there :P ), I've only tested it on my system with 2.4.18 and ksh (but
should work out of the box on any 2.4.xx, and with little modification on
2.5.xx).
