I get:
        PM-Timer running at invalid rate: 200% of normal - aborting.
        ...
        Time: pit clocksource has been installed.
Without the clocksource parameter.
Should tsc be preferred to pit though?
/sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/available_clocksource now
shows "jiffies tsc pit" and current_clocksource is "pit".
Thanks,
Ian.
