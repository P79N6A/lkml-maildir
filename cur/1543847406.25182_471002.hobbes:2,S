Well, because cfag12864b is the generic one I think it should be in
the /dev directory (whatever if you use or don't it / whatever if it
is useless or not).

Yep, IMO we should add a Kconfig option instead of mixing both by
default (cfag12864b and fbcfag12864b); anyway I think having
cfag12864b & fbcfag12864b is better than mixing it all in one module.
It is a good idea that adds many advantages; althought I don't know if
other people will agree with adding it. I have no problem coding the
fbcfag12864b module in my free time; but I prefer to remain the other
modules as they are now and add the fbcfag12864b later in time: I'm
waiting them to get into one of the -rcs without more radical changes.
