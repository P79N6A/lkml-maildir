Other per bus attributes might be address routing, VGA routing enabled,
Fast-back-to-back enabled. PCI-X bridges and PCI-e bridges might also
advertise data related to MMRBC and similar onboard buffer mgt behaviors.
ISTR, IBM PCI-X bridge works better with 512 "block" (data xfer size)
than larger sizes becuase it internally allocates buffer space
in 512B chunks. It would be useful to know along with downstream
device MMRBC. Not sure this all has to come from /sys though.
