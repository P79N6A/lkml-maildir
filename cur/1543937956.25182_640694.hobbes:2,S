Yes, most systems idle.

It will relative to not throttling.
You made a claim that is -physically impossible- as stated, a claim I've
seen here before and I'm correcting it. If something reduces heat, it
must save power *by the definition of heat and power*. And if you reduce
power usage, you will make your battery last longer.
Make any other statement you want about the efficiency of throttling per
unit work or the effectiveness of throttling relavite to other methods,
just stop repeating the claim that "throttling reduces heat but doesn't
save power". It goes against the law of conservation of energy.
