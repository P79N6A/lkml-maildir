Subject: [PATCH] drivers/char/pcwd.c - 2.4.19-pre3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch adds PCI support to Berkshire Products PC Watchdog card,
drivers/char/pcwd.c.  Also reviewed the existing code, and fixed a
number of "things done wrong", especially when dealing with hardware.
This is a large patch - about 30kb (or 50% bigger than driver source).
The module size has grown by about 900 bytes (to 4772, according to lsmod).
I have tested it with a PCI card and an ISA card (REV C, the newer ISA
model),  both used as a module, and hardwired into the kernel.
The patch is against 2.4.19-pre3, but the changelog shows no changes
to this code in pre4.
Introducing Me:  This is my first linux kernel patch, but I have been mucking
about with unix kernel drivers since AT&T's 6th Edition Unix, in about
1980.  Next goal is to achieve antique status.
