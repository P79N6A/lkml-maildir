Subject: 2.6.1mm2: very bad interactive behaviour under XFree86

Hi,
running an up-to-date XFree86 4.3 from Debian unstable, I have a stuck mouse
pointer in X11 every time some application uses 100% CPU. I have
folding@home running in the background at nice 19, which doesn't disturb
anything, but when my machine starts up the following happens:
- KDE 3.2 boots up,
- openoffice quickstart,
- KGpg reads a couple thousand keys,
- xmms, xosview, background picture, etc load up
- about 10 cm worth of applets in the KDE panel start
During this time (20-30sec) the mouse pointer jerks from position to
position about once to twice a second. My X server runs at priority 0, not
-10, as recommended. This has been the case since 2.6.0-test11, but I have
the (subjective) impression that under 2.6.1rc1-mm1 and 2.6.1-mm2 it got
worse.
I am using an Athlon XP 2600+ with 1024MB RAM, Nforce2 chipset, NVIDIA
XFree86 drivers.
Shall I try vanilla 2.6.1 and compare? Or is this an obvious problem?
Thanks!
