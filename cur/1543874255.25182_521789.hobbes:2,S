The unwinder can handle it fine, it is just that gcc right now cannot
be taught to generate correct unwind tables for it. If paravirt ops
is widely used i guess it would be possible to find some workaround
for that though.
There is one case it truly cannot handle (it would be possible by switching 
to dwarf3), but that was relatively easily eliminated and wasn't a problem
imho.

Initially we had some bugs that accounted for near all failures, but they 
were all fixed in the latest version.

I think better backtraces are a good use of my time. Sorry if you
disagree on that.
