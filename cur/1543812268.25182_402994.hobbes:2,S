Will the code compile and run with just #1-of-2 applied?
If not, we should combine the patches (which I can do in a jiffy).  Because
hitting a won't-compile in the middle of a git-bisect session is quite
painful.
Similarly we should aim for compiles-and-works at each step of the whole
series, if possible/sane.
