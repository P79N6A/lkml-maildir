	Because the security of a hash is based upon it being impractical to find
collisions. If you could demonstrate that you could find even a single
collision (by actually doing it), that would reduce confidence in MD5
massively.

	So what? You can, in principle, break a 4096-bit RSA key just by brute
force factorization. The security is based upon the difficulty of actually
doing it in practice. The simplicity of doing it in theory is irrelevent.
Yes, in theory you can break any public key encryption scheme or any hash
digest algrithm by brute force trial and error. In practice, however your
children's, children's, children's, children would be long dead before you
got 1% of the way there.
	To date, no full MD5 collisions have been published and until earlier in
this thread, nobody even claimed to have one. And I'll bet $100 to $1 that
the claimant is in error, either because he used only part of the hash or a
hash of the hash, mis-implementing the hash, o actually hashed the same data
twice without realizing it.
