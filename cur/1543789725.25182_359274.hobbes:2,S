This patch does not delete indirect function calls. It reduces number of
indirection steps or pointers to be followed only. You are right.
I should say:
	The patch eliminates one of indirection steps in 45 function
calls in 16 elevator functions.
A deleting one only indirection step is a good compromise between memory
waste and run time.
	From the very beginning the patch had deleted two additional
steps in indirect function calls and had returned to 2.6.9 stile. Chen
Kenneth proposed to delete only one indirection step and test it:

	A testing with SysBench fileio had shown that there is no
throughput increasing if one more indirection step is deleted. Hardware
is able to win two of three MOV instructions before function call.
	It should be noted that ops structure size is different for
different I/O schedulers. And while imbedding 'ops' structure the
maximal structure size should be used. First 'elevator' structure
embedding only increases wasted memory size by 104 bytes for each disk;
decreases Itanium's kernel object code by 856 bytes and increases
throughput by 2% at least.

does it really reduce those function calls? I thought it only reduced a
few pointers to be followed, but not the actual indirect function calls!
