OK, but /that/ was pretty clear from day one...

Should tell you something...

Again, should tell you something... "Look, a cool new gadget nobody ever
imagined before" sure attracts lots of people. Intriguing. Play around a
bit. Go for next "last novel gadget". Rinse, repeat.

Perhaps because nobody else sees any sense in them?

Wrong. Others will want plugins if they are any use, at the very least. And
then there is the possibility of /massive/ maintainance problems ("So, you
/are/ using Reiser 4, the broken file has attached plugin A version 5.3,
and is reached through a "directory" with plugin D 3.4rc5, and ..."). /I/
wouldn't want to be at the receiving end of bug reports which after a dozen
rounds boil down to this.

Not your call to make.

Your problem, not Linux'.

But they are! Just branch the kernel, and be done with it.

/You/ are asking the kernel developers for a /huge/ favor. Even totally go
out of their ways, and acting contrary to their set ways and beliefs.
Saying "no" to that can't be called "unfair"...

OK, so you have /never/ seen any reasons given here for not placing Reiser
4 into the kernel? Strange...

Right. Just like Reiser 3 right now.

How is that important in any way for the Linux kernel? This is not (and has
not been for quite some time now) an experimental operating system. And it
has /never/ been a dumpling ground for the next grand idea, it has always
been about sound engineering.
