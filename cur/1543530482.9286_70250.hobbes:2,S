Excuse me?  2.2 is the only released kernel.  I expect the
current kernel to get new drivers, at least until a newer
kernel is released.

This is meaningless.  The 2.2 kernel is CURRENT.  It is the
newest kernel that is released.  The 2.3 kernels are not released
yet.  As far as I am concerned the clock on 2.2 age doesn't
start until 2.4 is released.  So 2.2 is 0 years old.
