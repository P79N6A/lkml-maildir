Subject: insmod ipchains.o error in 2.3.16

Netlink 0.1.6 now compiles under 2.3.16.  However, after compilation I
get the following when attempting to insert the ipchains module:
[root@wr5z compat]# insmod ipchains.o
ipchains.o: unresolved symbol netlink_kernel_create
ipchains.o: unresolved symbol netlink_broadcast
This appears to be caused by those symbols only being exported when
CONFIG_NETLINK and/or CONFIG_NETLINK_DEV are defined.  Apparently,
Kernel/User netlink socket is what sets this.  The dependencies are not
set correctly and it is not clear from the docs that this must be true.
I can submit a patch this weekend when I have time if no one gets to it
before me.
Please let me know if my analysis is correct.  I'm just getting to the
point, thanks to "Linux Kernel Internals" where I'm comfortable trying
to parse kernel-related issues.
