Right, but if the alternative is spurious ENOMEM when we can satisfy
all of the pending requests just as long as they are serialised, is
this a problem?
If you want, wrap it in a "get_free_pagev" call which returns a vector
of pointers to free pages, doing whatever accounting is needed.  You
don't have to push all of it to the callers.
However, you just can't escape from the fact that on low memory
machinnes, we *need* beancounter-style accounting of pinned pages or
we'll be in Deep Trouble (TM).  We already have nasty DoS situations
which are embarassingly easy to reproduce.  If we need such
beancounter protection, AND such protection can prevent the situation
you describe, then do we need to go looking for another way of
achieving the same protection?
