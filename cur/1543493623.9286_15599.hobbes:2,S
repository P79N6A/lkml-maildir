IMHO it's a broken concept that every `admin-level' programs
has to hard-wire a path to kernel includes in configure/makefile.
is it real that GLIBC [authors] care that less for `admin-level' stuff ?
and even if most/all admin-level authors would do so, compiling their
code still breaks on systems where admin-level includes and kernel sources
are _not_ located in /usr/src/linux/ (like on my PC;)
