There's something really wrong going on with your ethernet controller. It
seems to try to take up all available space.
Please add a debug printk() to drivers/pci/setup-res.c to the very end of
pci_assign_bus_resource(), just before the "return -EBUSY", something like
	printk("device %s resource %d size %08lx\n", dev->name, resno, size);
just to see what it wants and why it fails..
Also, it's probably worth printing out what the actual bus resources are,
to possibly explain the failure. So add another line that says
	printk("bus res %d %x %08lx-%08lx\n", i, r->flags, r->start, r->end);
just after the line that says
	if (!r)
		continue;
in the same function.
