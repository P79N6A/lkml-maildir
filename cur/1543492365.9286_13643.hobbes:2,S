Hi
I get vmstat-1.0.tar.gz from sunsite.unc.edu and happy about the output of the disk usage.
My question is, if there is any possibility to list all disks connected to the system or maybe an option. It's the same in procinfo -D; all reads and writes are shown but only for the first four disks.
Greetings, Dietmar
