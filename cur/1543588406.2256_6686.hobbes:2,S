No, it's not on proper installations.
$  ls -l /usr/bin/eject 
 17k -rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root          16k Jan 29 01:14
/usr/bin/eject
You need to have write access to the device to eject it.
I guess you use something like /dev/cdrom as the device for the mount
point /mnt/cdmac, /dev/cdrom being a symlink to /dev/sr0.
Try 'eject /dev/cdrom' you'll probably have more luck.
