Hi,
i810fb as a module is broken (checked with 2.6.13-mm3 and 2.6.14-rc2-mm1).
It compiles, but the module doesn't actually load because the kernel doesn't 
recognize the hardware (the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE statement is missing).
The attached patch fixes this.
However, the resulting module still doesn't work.
It loads, and then garbles the display (black screen with a couple of yellow 
lines, no matter what is written into the framebuffer device).
