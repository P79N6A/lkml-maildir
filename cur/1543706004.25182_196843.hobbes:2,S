That idea has come up about a thousand million times.  Well, three.
It's a good one :)
It has lots of uses, not just the one you describe.  For example,
cacheing generated image data.
It would also be nice for a memory allocator to be able to convert a
region from MAP_PRIVATE to MAP_SCRATCH and back, so that freed blocks
of memory can be reclaimed by the system but only when there is memory
pressure.

The other downside of your idea is that every instance of a program
has more dirty pages.  While it is true that the pages do not require
disk I/O, they still take up RAM that could be used for other page
cache things.
