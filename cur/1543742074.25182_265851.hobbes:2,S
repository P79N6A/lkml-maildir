get_user_pages() is screwed, I'm just not sure
about failing get_user_pages() if PageReserved page
is encountered. 
I'm more worried about make_pages_present(), which is 
called by find_extend_vma/do_mmap_pgoff. Is it valid
to have PageReserved pages on the zones handled 
by these functions anyway?
This is equivalent of Andrea's fix for mainline.
Andrea, this in SuSE's tree for a while correct?
