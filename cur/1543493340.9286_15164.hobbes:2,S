Hi all.
I'm having abit of a problem with setting up Kernel 2.2.2 to run ipfwadm.
I can't seems to find the following networking options in Linux Kernel
2.2.2 Configuration menu system:
IP: forwarding/Gatewaying
IP: Accounting
There are seems to be twice the amount of options in 2.2.2 than 2.0.36 and
I'm a little bit confused.  Please direct me on what to do.  Many thanks.
Your help is highly appreciated.
Kent.
