Subject: [PATCH 2.(2|4)] agpgart_fe printk is too terse
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Appended patch against 2.4.20-pre4 fixes a (IMHO) way-too-terse printk in
drivers/char/agp/agpgart_fe.c
Motivation is that when scrounging through syslog etc finding an entry
that simply says "memory : <value>" leaves rather too much to the
imagination (not to mention being interesting to grep out of the
source).
This applies to 2.2 also (but has already been applied to 2.5).
Thanks,
Neale.
