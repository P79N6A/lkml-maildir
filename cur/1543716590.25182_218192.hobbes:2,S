If we're going to have a mini state machine, can't we at least use some
defines for each state...

...and make this into some readable english via a little helper?

I don't like this new naming. Since the patch is really all about
ownership of the local APIC, can't we call it something like
acquire_lapic_nmi()
release_lapic_nmi()
Neither perfctr nor oprofile have anything to do with watchdogs, so

Looks a little weird now.
