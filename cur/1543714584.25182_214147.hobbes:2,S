Oh, this is also false for all the distro users which are _already_
using /dev/sdX for their disks.
They _have_ to patch in libata, otherwise the upstream kernel will break
their disks by changing them from /dev/hdX to /dev/sdX.
Another problem is that the upstream /dev/hdX driver locks up for a many
users, where libata does not.
