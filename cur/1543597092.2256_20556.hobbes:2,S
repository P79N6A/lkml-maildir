See the above 's', plural, in case it was not obious I meant "all the
semaphores in the fast path", not just one, of course doing just one
would been nearly useless.
Both semaphore_S_ are just converted to rwsem in 2.4.7pre6aa1 so the
fast path *cannot* block any longer in my current tree.

Actually the _pe_lock is global and it's hold for a short time so it
can make some sense. And if you look closely you'll see that _pe_lock
should _definitely_ be a rw_spinlock not a rw_semaphore. I didn't
changed that though just to keep the patch smaller and to avoid changing
the semantics of the lock, the only thing that matters for us is to
never block and to have a fast read fast path which is provided just
fine by the rwsem (i'll left the s/sem/spinlock/ to the CVS).
