Of course it would be.  But I'm not yet sure it's practical; CML2's tokenizing
is actually being done by the Tk text widget and I have yet to discover
whether it can be told to discard the trailing period.
Note however that I didn't introduce these spaces for CML2 but to conform a
few exceptions to practice in the CML1 file.  My own choice would be to wrap
URLs and relative filenames in <> and treat those as delimeters, but I didn't
want to change the existing convention (yet).

There's a truism that the road to Hell is often paved with good intentions.
The corollary is that evil is best known not by its motives but by its
*methods*.
