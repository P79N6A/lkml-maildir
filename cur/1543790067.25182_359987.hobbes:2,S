What happened with page_mkwrite?  It seems to have disappeared both from
-mm and generally from the face of the earth...
I am very interested in having such ability for ntfs...
Is anyone still working on this?  If not why not?  Did it prove
impractical or ...?
If no-one is working on this anymore, where do I find the last "current"
patch?
Thanks a lot in advance!
Best regards,
        Anton
