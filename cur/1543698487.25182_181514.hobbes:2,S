That's funny! I'm running 2.4.19-pre2-ac2 plus three patches which
solved something I'd have to rethink to describe. But most of my laptops
suspend fine with APM and 2.4, and suspend fine with 2.6 and ACPI but
never return to life... I realize APM is depreciated with 2.6, so I'm
resigned to 2.4 on those machines.

The last time I tried Nick's patches was on test15, there are only so
many hours in my day, and my best test machine is slow enough to
discourage building a lot of kernels. You might see if his version 15
patches will work on test11, or if test10-mm1 works better for you.
Since you're looking for knobs... You might also look at the swappiness
(/proc/sys/vm/swappiness) to see if that changes the stuff which bugs
you.
