See if this patch applies on 2.4, it probably does.  If not I'll look
into the rejects when I get a chance ...
Note also that much of the thanks for these interfaces should go to
Ingo, since he got set_cpus_allowed working with p != current.
btw: I have an MGA-G550 (uses the same mga driver as you) and have no
problems with X on an SMP machine ...
