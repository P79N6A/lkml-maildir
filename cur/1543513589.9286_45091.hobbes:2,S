Impressive. I got something interesting quite near that place - in
pagemap.h:102 (inode's page list being nonempty with i_nrpages==0).
And it's a UP box - SMP races have nothing with it. -pre4. I'm trying to
cactch it right now. _Very_ reproducible - as the matter of fact it hits
before the sucker gets to spawning getty. init=/bin/sh is your friend ;-/
