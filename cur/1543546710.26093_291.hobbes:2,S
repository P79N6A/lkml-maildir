But it is. It's run long enough to load the CPU cache with it's own
instructions and data. Since you are trying to preserve the CPU cache,
you want it to run again instead of something else. Right?
From the original post:

Process B in my example is the process that is briefly interrupted. It
should reschedule onto the same cpu right away. But it doesn't.

But you *do* want it to get tied to the CPU since it's "stuff" is in the
CPU cache. Right?
In fact, isn't last_cpu doing time affinity already? Except in the case
where
there are more than one processes that have the same last_cpu. Then
you have to figure out how to choose the most recent one.

I think I understand what you're trying to do, but at the same time
if I do we should agree. So I'm probably misunderstanding something.
