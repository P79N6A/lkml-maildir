Hi all,
I have to use 64bit variable in my 2.6.27 kernel NAND driver as below:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
u64 NAND_capacity;
unsigned int block_num, block_size;
...
block_num = NAND_capacity / block_size;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
but it failed when compiling and reports 'undefined reference to `__udivdi3'.
Does any idea about this? I need to include some special head file or change something in Kconfig?
BTW, the environment is Fedora Core 9, gcc 4.3.0. 
Thanks a lot.
Rgds,
Yunpeng Gao
