Hi,
We'd like to announce the first alpha release of NetKeeper.
NetKeeper is a fast, decision diagram based firewall for Linux.
Current release includes (among other things) a stable kernel module
that allows a user filter packets based on header-field values, and
a performance evaluation demonstrating that there is a clear
performance advantages to use this approach.
For more details check out the netkeeper web-site:
