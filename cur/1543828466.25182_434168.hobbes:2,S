Sounds like trouble for modules. I am assuming that code to power down the
scsi disks/controller will be part of the driver, which is generally built
as a module and also assuming that powering down the disks is a valid
requirement after the crash.
After introducing an option to disable/enable crash notifiers from user
space I think now responsibility lies to with user. If he chooses to enable
the notifiers, he understands that there are chances that we never boot
into the next kernel and get lost in between.
