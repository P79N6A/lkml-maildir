Subject: [PATCH 000 of 11] md: Introduction - assort md enhancements for 2.6.18
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/1/2

The follow 11 patch are assorted tidy-ups and functionality
enhancements suitable for 2.6.18 when that opens up.
More interesting patches are:
 5 - merge raid5 and raid6 code into a single module.  There is a lot
      of common code here, and there are advantages in uniting it all.
 8 - allow a linear array to be expanded while online by adding an
     extra drive.
 10- A new flavour of 'raid10' which matches one of the layouts
     supported by 'DDF' - an industry standard raid metadata format
     which might be supported one day.  This will need an updated
     mdadm to experiment with.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
