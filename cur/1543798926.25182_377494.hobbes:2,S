As a dirty trick, you should be able to avoid this by adding the
following line just before #include <linux/cn_proc.h> :
   #define _LINUX_TIME_H
So that the preprocessor will think it has already included <linux/time.h>
definitions and will not load them again. Of course, if they are needed,
you're lost.
