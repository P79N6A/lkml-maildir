Linux is one thing that a community has created and maintained based on 
mailing list.
I know i'm out of scope but let's take some time to react to gas price 
increase and
environment destruction.
I would like to ask you to reduce by 10 % your gas / petrol consumption by 
car.
yes this is possible ! Just relax and drive slowly and this possible , i 
have tried and
now i use 15 % less than before just by driving smoothly.
So let's try and forward this idea to your knowledge in your country, this 
will probably
start a new power against the petrol business price policy and it would 
enable less
air polution and better security.
This is possible , try it first !
Eric
