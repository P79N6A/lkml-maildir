OK, here's a version that's cleaner and suspends.  Resuming ...
another story, it's currently broken on this ARM board (no
relationship to this testing code).
Note to Pavel:  yes, the version with the pony *is* better.

============ CUT HERE
Updated verion of Pavel's "sleepy" test.  This version doesn't depend on
x86-specific RTC support, or suspend-to-RAM capability, and describes
itself a bit better.
Partially tested on an ARM board ... for some reason system sleep states
are currently broken on that system (new behavior since 2.6.24), so this
won't yet complete.
Note a generic glitch:  the message strings aren't in the same section
as the function using them, so this has a bigger runtime footprint than
it should.
