Not automatic, more likely add a USER field to uname -r.  Leave it up
to the kernel builder what they want to put there, most will leave it
blank.  The first four fields are reserved for Linus, the fifth is
anything the kernel builder wants.  I can just imagine this
make USER=-pre7-vm76-kdb1.5beta1-aa137.2c bzImage modules
# uname -r
2.4.0-test9-pre7-vm76-kdb1.5beta1-aa137.2c
/lib/modules/2.4.0-test9-pre7-vm76-kdb1.5beta1-aa137.2c/... :)
Best take this discussion to linux-kbuild (see MAINTAINERS) if you want
to continue.
