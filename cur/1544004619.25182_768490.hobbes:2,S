BTW I'm wondering about consistency in time capturing.
When I look into kernel/sched_clock.c I see this in introduction:
"The clock: sched_clock_cpu() is monotonic per cpu, and should be somewhat
consistent between cpus (never more than 2 jiffies difference)."
Two Jiffies, that could result in a lot of inconsistency in the way of
nanosec capturing. The current task
can be preempted between the call time and the return time and I'm
doing a cpu_clock(raw_smp_processor_id)
on these two times.
Should I keep the same processor_id for these two captures? But what
would happen if this cpu is shut
down between these two times?
One other solution would be to plan time capture in usec but I would
mostly lose the interest of function cost measuring....
What do you think?
Thanks.
