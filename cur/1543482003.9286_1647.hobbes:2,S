Me too: but in my case I ctrl-c'ed the 'make -j' before it gave any fork
failures (unless they just happened so quickly I didn't notice but I
doubt that).
I also reported this, in two threads.  The first I started ("Weird: loss
of files during kernel build (!)"), and in the second I was replying to
an existing thread ("2.1.125 filesystem corruption under extreme
load").  These were back last November.
I think the evidence is that we have a serious bug that's hard to
trigger.
Someone with an expendable filesystem :-) needs to try and reproduce
this (I'd love to volunteeer but I'm not in a position to do so for at
least a few weeks).
