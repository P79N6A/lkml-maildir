In certain situations theoretically yes, the kernel is better off
continuing to poll than switching to the idle thread. You can do this to
some extent in a driver already today - just poll rather than sleeping
but respsect the reschedule hints and don't do it with irqs masked.

For things like SATA based devices they aren't that fast yet.
