Your kernel stack has been overwritten with seemingly-random data.
This is impossible to diagnose -- some module possibly scribbled
over the stack.

Threadinfo is at dd070000 so end-of-stack is at dd071ff8
dd071ff8 - dd071f38 = 192 (decimal) so there are 192 bytes on the
kernel stack.  We can see 192 bytes and there is no sensible regs
information at the end, just random junk.

Where did these modules come from?
