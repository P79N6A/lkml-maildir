It's bumping against some mapping (just do system("cat /proc/self/maps")
on allocation failure to see which). Usual suspects are shared libraries.
One possible solution is to upgrade to a newer glibc, the 2.2 glibc malloc 
should handle this case better.  
A way to get mappings like shared libraries out of the way is to 
increase the value of TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE in include/asm-i386/processor.h.
For that the kernel needs to be recompiled and it should be smaller
TASK_SIZE-enough space for your shared libraries. With that even the older
malloc will probably work.
