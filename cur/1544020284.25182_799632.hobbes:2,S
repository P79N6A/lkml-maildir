Looks good to me.
I started down the track of merging similar headers on Friday too.
So far I have about 12 or so for review at in the git tree below.
(One of which is exactly this unistd.h merge :-)  Still plenty of
easy merges amongst the other files too...
The following changes since commit 18e352e4a73465349711a9324767e1b2453383e2:
   Linus Torvalds (1):
         Linux 2.6.29-rc3
are available in the git repository at:
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gerg/m68knommu.git 
for-linus
Greg Ungerer (15):
       m68knommu: mark all RAM as ZONE_DMA
       m68knommu: add a local dma_sync_single_for_cpu() function
       m68k: use the mmu pci.h for m68knommu as well
       m68k: swtich non-mmu setups to use the mmu dma-mapping.h
       m68k: use the mc146818rtc.h for non-mmu setups as well.
       m68k: use mmu kmap_types.h for non-mmu setups as well
       m68knommu: remove no longer used mcfpci.h
       m68k: merge the mmu and non-mmu versions of mmu.h
       m68k: use mmu scatterlist.h for non-mmu setups as well
       m68k: use mmu fpu.h for non-mmu builds as well
       m68k: use mmu timex.h for non-mmu setups as well
       m68k: use mmu version of elf.h for non-mmu builds as well
       m68k: use non-mmu version of unaligned.h for all m68k
       m68k: remove non-mmu unistd.h
       m68k: the one hw_irq.h can be used buy all m68k
