Subject: building i386 requires s390: "driver/crypto/Kconfig" sourcing s390 arch

Seems there is an include of s390 based config in file
drivers/crypto/Kconfig: source "arch/s390/crypto/Kconfig"
The line doesn't seem to be need for an i386 build (haven't
tried x86_64 though).
I take it that this was a braino?
