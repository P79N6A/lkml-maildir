 Hello, guys,
 I've just seen the LWN summary of discussions regarding filename
charset encoding and read some of the threads.  I had the same issues
myself and have been working on a solution.  A new locale LC_FSCTYPE
is introduced to specify the charset encoding of filenames and libc
sits between the kernel and application and translates the charsets of
LC_CTYPE and LC_FSCTYPE appropriately. As proof-of-concept, I've
implemented a preloading library (libfsxlat) which overrides affected
libc functions. The README file contains detailed description of the
solution.

 I'm currently working on merging LC_FSCTYPE into glibc and I believe
it's almost done.  LC_FSCTYPE implementation in glibc includes iconv
caching and the syntax of LC_FSCTYPE is changed such that it's
identical to other locales.  Any comments are welcomed and please
don't forget to CC me as I'm not on the list.
 Cheers.
