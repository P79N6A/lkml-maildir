Nope. It's the following hunk:

The above change implies that the portmapper can always be run from an 
insecure port.
It can if the purpose of the RPC call is trying to read off a port number for 
an RPC service. If the idea is to register a new service, however, then the 
portmapper demands that we use a secure port.
The fix would be to add an argument to the function pmap_create() in order to 
allow rpc_register() to specify that the call to xprt_create_proto() should 
set up the socket on a secure port.
Cheers,
