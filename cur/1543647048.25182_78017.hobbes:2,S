The Linux Test Project test suite LTP-20021008.tgz has been released. Visit
our website (
http://ltp.sourceforge.net
) to download the latest version of
the testsuite, and for information on test results on pre-releases, release
candidates & stable releases of the kernel. There is also a list of test
cases that are expected to fail, please find the list at (
http://ltp.sourceforge.net/expected-errors.php
)
The highlights of this release are:
- Updated the STAX LTP driver. You can now specify client and server
logging paths.  The ability to define how long a single test is allowed run
has been added. Plus, hardware information is now included in the logs for
each client. The HowTo has been updated as well.
- Updated the Database Opensource Test Suite (DOTS) with added
functionality to allow the use of MySQL and PostreSQL databases,
complementing the existing features that allow the use of DB2, Oracle, and
Sybase databases.  Additionally, DOTS is now available as an on-demand test
suite at the Open Source Development Lab's Linux Kernel Scalable Test
Platform. (

)
- An additional shared memory control test has been added (shmctl04), that
tests the SHM_INFO command.
We encourage the community to post results, patches, or new tests on our
mailing list, and to use the CVS bug tracking facility to report problems
that you might encounter. More details available at our web-site.
