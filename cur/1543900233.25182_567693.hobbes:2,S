I know breaking user-interface is a bad thing across releases. But in
this particular case, it's probably ok (since fair-group scheduling is a
brand new feature in Linux)?
If we have that option of breaking API between 2.6.23 and 2.6.24
for fair-group scheduler, then we are in a much more flexible position.
For 2.6.23, I can send a user-id based interface for fair-group
scheduler (with some /proc interface to tune group nice value).
For 2.6.24, this user-id interface will be removed and we will instead
switch to container based interface. Fair-user scheduling will continue
to work, its just that users will have to use a daemon (sources sent in
previous mail) to enable it on top of container-based interface.
Hmm..?
