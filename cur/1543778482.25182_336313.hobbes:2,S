Also, it's conceivable that ext3 is implicated here, so it might be saner
to perform initial investigation on ext2.
(when kjournald writes back a page via its buffers, the page remains
"dirty" as far as the VFS is concerned.  Later, someone tries to do a
writepage() on it and we'll discover the buffers' cleanness and the page
will be cleaned without any I/O being performed.  All the throttling
_should_ work OK in this case.  But ext2 is more straightforward.)
