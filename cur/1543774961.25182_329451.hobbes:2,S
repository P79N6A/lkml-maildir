Would you really like a system where once something was faulted in, it could
never leave? You'd run out of memory *awfully* fast.

Nix,
You should only fault if you have a place to fault to, as into a swap.
Without swap faulting is overkill.
Is it possible to change kswapd's default behaviour to not fault if there is
no swap?
Thanks!
