As I've understood it, the configuration for DM is userspace and the kernel
can't do any auto detection.  This would be a "put off" for me to use as a
root filesystem.  Configurations like this (and lvm too last I looked at it)
require an initrd or some other way of setting up the device.  Unfortunately
this means that there's configs in 2 locations (one not easily available,  if
using initrd.  easily != mounting via loop!)
