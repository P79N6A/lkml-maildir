9600/19200/93750/187500/500000/1500000 baud, of which IIRC only the first two 
are possible with the standard clocks and divisors that I'll find on a PC.
get_cycles() is a reasonable abstraction which can be used across a few 
platforms (Alpha/MIPS/i586+/sparc64/ppc)

Then it may not be able to get certification while running on those - it 
should still be possible to get it to work, though.
I suppose if I don't actually want to get it certified, then I can get it to
work without the timing info - I can definitely manage to send packets OK, it's
just that my interpretation of the spec I quoted earlier is that I _must_ drop
packets which don't quite meet the timing requirements.
Hopefully, the test procedures won't actually involve sending such packets and 
making sure that the implementation being tested drops the offending packets.
