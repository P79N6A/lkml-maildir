Yep.. I have 28 Maxtor Maxline-II drives on Promise SATA150TX4's
They all show up under /dev/scsi/host??

Not that I know of.. it has been working great here for months now.. (bar the odd oops)

So it does..
I'm still using a 2.6.10-bk10 kernel here with the libata-dev patches and some minor md patches.. 
It's stable unless one of the drives throws an error, whereapon libata oops and stops talking to the 
other drives (and then it gets really messy).. Have not had time to reproduce/upgrade to see if it's 
fixed though.
Regards,
Brad
