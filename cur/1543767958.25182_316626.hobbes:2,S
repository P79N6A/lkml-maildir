We have 
http://armlinux.simtec.co.uk/kautobuild/
 setup for ARM -
it would be nice if it could generate mail reports and send them
out, especially when failures occur.
I think it would need some post-processing and rate limiting to
determine if there is a common problem across multiple platforms
(eg, 40 builds failing due to rd_size), or just one platform (some
local breakage).
