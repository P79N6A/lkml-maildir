Actually this is not the case. I will be building mechanisms to 
support binary loadble drivers for our products into the Linux 
kernels, and making those available as patches. I truly believe such 
a mechanim will help make Linux a better OS, and I asked both Alan 
and Linus whether they would accept support for this type of 
mechanism if I created it and submitted the patches to them.
They flatly refused and said they would not support anything that 
will allow for binary portable modules. So I will do this for our own 
needs, but no-one else will benefit from this because it won't be a 
part of the standard Linux distributions. I don't have any problem 
developing and supporting this code for our own products, and I don't 
expect anyone to write this code for me.
However I am upset by the notion that the GPL nature of the Linux 
kernel source can and is being used to force hardware vendors to 
release Open Sourcce drivers because they have no other option. Not 
because another option is not feasible, but because the core 
developers of Linux want to lock our proprietry solutions.

I plan on doing just that. The problem is that my changes will never 
be accepted into standard kernel distributions, because as Linus 
said, doing so will enable hardware vendors to release binary-only 
drivers if they wish.
So what? The whole thrust of my argument is that 3dfx and other 
vendors will go Open Source because the benefits outweight the 
pitfalls. I strongly believe that 3dfx and others will still do Open 
Source drivers even if Linux did support a device driver model that 
allowed binary only drivers.
