Oddly, the tools already provide the capability needed by anaconda, just 
not in the format the anaconda scripts and code expect.  i.e., anaconda 
is using -m in place of -F, and somewhere down the line someone needed 
to force depmod checks of modules against mismatched kernels (???) which is
probably left over from some point when RedHat was shipping default
kernels "naked" (without modversions).  That's the only justification
I can see for having -i at all, and since I come from a binary compatible
world, I can kindof understand why someone would have needed this 
to support loading of binary modules accross versions (before modversions 
became widely used).  I don't know how to take the "anaconda hacker" moniker.
