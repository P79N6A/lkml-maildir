Subject: 2.5 neofb screen corruption leaving X
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Description: The console is "blown up" upon leaving X with neofb
compiled in on an IBM TP600E. Characters are 2-3 times normal size, dots
are not in consecutive pixels but spaced several screen elements apart.
Lines are still spaced normally but the larger text overwrites the
previous line when they wrap. The system is still usable, but the
console is unreadable ;-) I can still go back into X just fine.
Environment: IBM Thinkpad 600E, NeoMagic 256AV, RedHat 8.0.94 (Phoebe)
lspci -v
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Neomagic Corporation NM2200
[MagicGraph 256AV] (rev 20) (prog-if 00 [VGA])
        Subsystem: IBM ThinkPad 570
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 128, IRQ 11

Kernels: Tested 2.5.67-2.5.69 and are affected, haven't gone back
further yet but I can test. RedHat 2.4.18 works correctly. 
Config is here:
