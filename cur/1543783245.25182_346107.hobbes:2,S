That sequence is altered in the first and last repetitions, like this:
88 4020 1008 0402
81 4020 1008 0402
[...]
81 4020 1008 0402
81 4020 1008 04c2
The 4020 and 0402 look oddly symmetrical to me, but that could just
be my imagination.
I wrote a quick perl script to find the number of occurrences of 8-bit
aligned sequences of 16-bits, for all 16-bit values.  It has some
interesting (and potentially useful) results.
The script:
http://zeus.moffetthome.net/~kyle/hexfreq
The output:
http://zeus.moffetthome.net/~kyle/dwl.hexmult
Reprocessed output by frequency:
http://zeus.moffetthome.net/~kyle/dwl.hexfreq
Reprocessing command:
<dwl.hexmult sed -re 's/^(.*): (.*)$/\2: \1/g' | sort -gr >dwl.hexfreq
Cheers,

Somone asked me why I work on this free (

)
software stuff and not get a real job. Charles Shultz had the best  
answer:
"Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems? They do  
it because
life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't. That's why I  
draw
cartoons. It's my life."
