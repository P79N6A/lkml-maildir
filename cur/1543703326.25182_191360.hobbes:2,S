As pointed this in an unfortunate side effect of the nature of driver
dependency: iswraid (in ataraid/IDE subsystem) depending on ata_piix (in
SCSI). The above solution will solve the issue. 
But can anyone shed some light on resolving this issue other than
compiling the driver as kernel module ?
i.e is there a way I can change the order of driver initialization in
the kernel ? Load SCSI subsystem before IDE ? 
Thanks,
boji
