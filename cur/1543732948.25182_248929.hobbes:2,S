That is not a solution, that is exactly the opposite of a solution.
"Roll my own" implies that I must download the tar file, extract the
whole thing, grab what I need, and then tar it up again.  Then I extract
it again.  Doh!
More seriously, suppose it's a format like zip, where I don't have to
decompress the whole file to get a listing.  And suppose I want to
compile some little example from it, but the file itself is huge -- half
a gig, say, and I only need ten megabytes.
But the only way I'm going to find out _which_ ten megabytes I need is
to extract the Makefile, read it, then go find all the other little
Makefiles, not to mention the configure script, the header files, and so
on...
But suppose that make can _transparently_ extract _only_ the files I
need for this?

Does it really bloat the kernel?  My kernel doesn't feel bloated, and
it's got reiser4 and much of what's needed for this.
Remember, saying "I can access foo.zip/contents" doesn't mean "zip is in
the kernel".

It does for it to appear installed.  And to only install the pieces that
are needed at that time.

No, only that if I only wanted OpenOffice writer, why should I install
all of OpenOffice?  Yes, it could be broken into smaller packages.  What
I'm talking about is exactly the pieces of an installation that you need
- -- insanely fine granularity -- done automatically, on demand.
