Hi!
I'm a newbie here on the list and also as a "kernel hacker". There's a
bug reported in bugzilla (Bug 7927), cite:
> In the function __down
> 
> fastcall void __sched __down(struct semaphore * sem)
> {
>  struct task_struct *tsk = current;
>  DECLARE_WAITQUEUE(wait, tsk);
>  unsigned long flags;
> 
>  tsk->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE;
>  spin_lock_irqsave(&sem->wait.lock, flags);
>  add_wait_queue_exclusive_locked(&sem->wait, &wait);
>  ...
> }
> 
>

I have marked it as rejected as as I can see at the time this function is called,
it is guaranteed that ret_from_intr() will not call schedule() on return from an 
interrupt handler to either kernel space or user space because of the call 
to macro might_sleep() in semaphore's down(). Am I wrong?
Thanks and best regards,
