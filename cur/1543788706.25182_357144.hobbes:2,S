Did I say I'm against it? No, I was just hoping someone put some more 
thought into it than just "all the other kids are doing it".
I was just curious how well it really scales compared to the simple 
version, e.g. what happens if most timer end up on a single cpu or what 
happens if we want to start the timer on a different cpu. Is this so wrong 
that you have to go into attack mode? :(

Why do use "PIT on SMP" as an extreme example to reject the general 
concept completely? This doesn't explain, why first such a (simple) SMP 
design shouldn't exist and why secondly my suggestion is such a big 
problem.
