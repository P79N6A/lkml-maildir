Whoa... that's a hack.. but yes, you can probably do that, and I think
kernel even has neccessary interfaces already. (They were needed for

Hmm, save/restore graphics state from the kernel would of course be
clean solution, but you should have that anyway... what if someone
suspends without X running?
And of course you can just cheat, and not do kernel save-state on your
