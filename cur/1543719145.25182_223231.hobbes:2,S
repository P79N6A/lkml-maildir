Hello,
It seems there is a problem with idebus parameter with 2.6.7-rc1.
Indeed, it doesn't take into account lilo append.
With 2.6.7-rc1-mm1, i've got:
Kernel command line: BOOT_IMAGE=LinuxNEW ro root=304 idebus=66
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=xx
With 2.6.6-mm3, i've got:
May 24 11:37:43 greg-port kernel: Kernel command line:
BOOT_IMAGE=LinuxNEW ro root=304 idebus=66
May 24 11:37:43 greg-port kernel: ide_setup: idebus=66
May 24 11:37:43 greg-port kernel: ide: Assuming 66MHz system bus speed
for PIO modes
I tried to seek in the code, but my level is not as good as I would like
it. :)
Thank you all for the good work with linux, keep up with it ! :)
