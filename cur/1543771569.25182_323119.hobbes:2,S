I think this is another case of someone reporting a problem and not
providing any feedback to replies.  Bjorn followed up on this and
I haven't seen a response.
However, port.type won't be set for serial console.  This is entirely
expected.  We haven't approached the normal port initialisation and
as such we treat the port as being the lowest common denominator - a
standard 8250 port.
If we do want port.type initialised, the solution for this is to get
rid of the early initialisation of 8250-based consoles entirely, which
is something I keep saying and not doing because I know I'm going to
get whinged at.
