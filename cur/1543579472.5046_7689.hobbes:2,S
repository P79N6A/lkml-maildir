Hi Peter,
Regardless if we rip out the entire rule of majors for dev_t, will there
be a service dummy driver to various block-devices?  There is a real need
for this if we are going to get full control of the hardware by indirect
access obtain the functionality that I see and need in the near future.
I want to use KMOD to an advantage.
Assume removable device bays such that you can swap in any and every kind
of ata-atapi device and/or all scsi-devices, one needs to have a way to
tell the driver to do things that are not native to its general mode of
operations as of today.
Cheers,
