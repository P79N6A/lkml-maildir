Hi:  In upgrading from 2.2.17 (also had 2.4.0-test5 working) to
2.4.6 I am getting the following error when I try to load the es1371
module:
/lib/modules/2.4.6/kernel/drivers/sound/es1371.o: unresolved symbol 
ac97_probe_codec_R1c61c357
A post in Jan 2001 seemed to indicate this might have something
to do with selecting SMP, which I don't have selected.  Any
idea on what might be causing this problem?  I have
soundcore, sound, and es1371 selected as modules...the first
two load fine.
Please cc any replies to my address, thanks.
