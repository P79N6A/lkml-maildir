There are a few minor coding style issues (the initial '{' for a
function needs to be on a new line) and I need a "Signed-off-by:" line,
and it probably will not apply right now due to the pci quirks changes
(if you rediff it against the latest -mm tree, that should fix it.)
Other than that, it looks good to me.
