Hi, 
By reading the discussion I also agree that we need levels of "allowed deepness"
into the reservations.
We could have a global limit for normal allocators, and per-task 
limit for special "kswapd helpers" (which run with PF_MEMALLOC). 
And with kswapd being the most "deep" eater, as you guys said.
The thing is, those deadlocks are quite uncommon special cases and 
we will need to change core VM logic to handle them. Well...
We need to come up with a generic way of doing it, as Avi says, 
otherwise people will have to keep doing "hacks" to make it work.
Someone needs to sit down and come up with a design. It shouldnt 
be that hard.
Just my two pennies...
