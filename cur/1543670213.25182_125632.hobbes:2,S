 Certain Linux 2.4 calls pass a sixth parameter in EBP. Calls compatible with earlier versions of the kernel pass six or
 more parameters in a parameter block and pass the address of the parameter block in EBX (this change was probably
 made in kernel 2.4 because someone noticed that an extra copy between kernel and user space was slowing down
 those functions with exactly six parameters; who knows the real reason, though).
Relevant? No idea.
