Hi all,
we are trying to access the PCMCIA slots of a Toshiba Satellite
notebook. Kernel version is 2.2.7 (SuSE 6.1 evaluation version).
As predicted by the SuSE support database entry, the whole system
hangs when PCMCIA is included during boot-up.
According to the "contents" entry, SuSE uses version 3.0.9.
Which version should we try out ?
We are planning to use an Adaptec APA-1460 _D_ card, but the
list of supported cards does only list 1460A and B. Will there 
be support for the 1460D soon ?
Thank you in advance,
 Steffen
