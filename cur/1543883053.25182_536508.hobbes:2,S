Should a bool be displayed as "true" or "false"?

To be completely pedantic: we shouldn't be printing u32's with %u.  Because
%u assumes that u32 is implemented as unsigned int.  Only it's an opaque
type and we don't know what actual C type the architecture chose to use.
It happens to work OK on all architectures and I expect it always will, so
no change is needed, but there you have it.
u64's and %llu _are_ incompatible on some architectures and I get to fix
that about 1000000 times.
