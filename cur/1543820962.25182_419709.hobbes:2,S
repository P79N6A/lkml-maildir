To quote Jan's original description (should have put that in)
I think it's needed.

The effect is not on the current user's parameter passing, but in the result the function may produce. If, say, for the
PCI mmconfig and BIOS space, there is a (reserved) entry starting at E0000000 and being 20000000 in size, then as far as
I can tell the function will return zero (rather than one).
