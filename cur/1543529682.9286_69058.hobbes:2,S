Barely.  It works for some kernel versions, and fail for others. And
requires
extra libraries for X that I don't have on all machines.  And I do some
compiles without bringing up X first, so I use "make oldconfig" most of
the time,
and run "make menuconfig" whenever something new comes up, so I can look 
at the help texts.
I realize that using two kinds of "if" isn't necessary after all.  For
stuff that
fits in a tree structure - use the current approach and show only the
choices
where dependencies further up in the tree is satisfied. You need to
enable sound before selecting a soundcard - that is obvious.
I propose a different handling for items that have dependencies in other
branches:
Show them as soon as all dependencies in the same branch is satisfied.  
If the user turns it on - give a confirmation message like "This also
require
features Z, Y, & Z, ok to turn them on? Y/N/M)" 
Trivial cases can be answered with Y or M, N is used when the user want
to take
a closer look at what X, Y & Z are first.
