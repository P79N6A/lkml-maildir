Yes - if we are going to perform some MAC checks for this kernel process 
we need to have all checks performed.

This is true for going this route in general rather than simply 
bypassing MAC. I don't think halfway makes any sense.

I don't think this is a race, it is revocation of access. If you check 
the access at every operation and correctly deal with access failures, 
then this shouldn't be a problem. Yes it is a pain, but that is how 
SELinux is supposed to work.
