Actually, 3 years ago, I researched this in my
company's lab.  There is about a 1 in 180 probability
of the power to the read/write head failing before the
sector write is complete.
The end result is a sector that fails ECC check.  The
linux kernel reports this and your I/O operation
returns with an error.
Not easy, but if you force a rewrite of the sector,
the problem cures itself.  Not easy to do through the
VFS though.  I was only able to make it happen by
using dd if=/dev/zero on the unmounted device node. 
After that, the sector read just fine.
