   Er, surely the same goes for sys_sendfile? Why have a new system call 
   rather than just swapping the 'in' and 'out' fds?
There is an assumption that one is a linear stream of output (in this
case a socket) and the other one is a page cache based file.
It would be nice to extend sys_sendfile to work properly in both
ways in a manner that Linus would accept, want to work on that?
