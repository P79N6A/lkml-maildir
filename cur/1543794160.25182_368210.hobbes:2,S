The recent vbetool suspend-from-ram datapoint shows that it might be
important that the BIOS data area is application local,
ie. MAP_PRIVATE.  Ie. it works only if the writes are not performed
to the real BIOS data page.
If true, that means the MAP_PRIVATE+VM_UNPAGED case has legit users.
Although, such applications could just copy the interrupt vector plus
BIOS data area into an anonymously mapped region and have the vm86
execution work off that instead of the /dev/mem mapping.
So, just to make sure this all adds up, a PROT_WRITE+MAP_PRIVATE
mapping of /dev/mem results in any pages written to being COW'd.
Right?
It is a good question as to which cases doing stuff like this want to
make modifications to the real BIOS data area, and which ones do not.
Aparently vbetool does not.
