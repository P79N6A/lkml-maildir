	And this is exactly what we can't have happen.  If I am an
administrator, I don't want to have to write all my scripts to do:
if [ -f /etc/redhat-release ]
then
    DISKPREFIX="/dev/disk"
elif [ -f /etc/unitedlinux-release ]
then
    DISKPREFIX="/dev/disc"
elif [ -f /dev/volume0 ]
then
    DISKPREFIX="/dev/volume"
elif 
    ...
	Please, let's not repeat GNOME/KDE, OpenLook/Motif,
mkinitrd/mkinitrd, etc for all our devices.
