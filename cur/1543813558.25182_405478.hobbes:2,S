ah ok.
Is your SDP slower than the "ethernet emulation" for message passing?

I guess I need to look at the code if I want to understand
what "ethernet emulation" and "simple net device driver"
exactly mean.
You missed the netdev and netfilter guys ranting when Infiniband
promoters proprosed putting a switch in the kernel to bypass
the TCP/IP stack when SDP was available. This happened at OLS2004
Infiniband BOF. Very strong opposition to SDP masquerading
as AF_INET.  SDP is squatting on AT_INET_SDP (27) until it
gets integrated in the kernel.
