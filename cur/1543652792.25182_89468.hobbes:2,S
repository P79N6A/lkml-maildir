Strictly speaking user don't have to be root.  Currently the syscall 
only requires users to have root as one of the supplementary groups (and 
that is how Oracle is actually using these syscalls).  And if 
CAP_IPC_LOCK (to make it coherent with fs side of the world) is what is 
preferdto provide access to hugepages then that change is simple also. 
 Don't need to do any chmod.
