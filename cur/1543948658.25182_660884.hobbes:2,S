So we want to store persistant state in the kernel across userspace process
invokations.  That's normally done with a thing called a "file" ;) Could we
stick all the necessary state into files in a pseudo-fs and have the daemon
go and open and read them all when it restarts?

I don't understand that bit.  But then, I don't have a clue how autofs
works.

It isn't a good idea to wait for races to reveal themselves.  It will take
years, especially with a system which has as low a call frequency as autofs
mounting.  And once a bug _does_ reveal itself, by then we'll have tens of
millions of machines out there running that bug.

yeah, could be a problem.  Hopefully the namespace people can advise. 
Perhaps we need a concept of an exportable-to-userspace namespace-id+uid,
namespace-id+gid, namespace-id+pid, etc for this sort of thing.  It has
come up before.  Recently, but I forget what the context was.
