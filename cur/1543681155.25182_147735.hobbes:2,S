It's not a bad idea.

Sure - but take an app that is normally using TCP sockets and give it
an AF_UNIX socket..  Something as general as the event loop
_shouldn't_ have to depend on that subtlety.
Ok that's avoidable, but it's a trap.  It would be nice to get a flag
that doesn't have a caveat in the manual saying "this flag only works
(at present) on TCP sockets in kernels >= 2.5.76.  Take care not to
use the optimisation for any other kind of fd including other sockets,
as it will break your app...".  That's not the sort of thing I want to
see in the epoll manual page :)
Anyway, there is a correct answer and I have made the patch so wait
for next mail... :)
