Jeff Garzik and netdev@oss.sgi.com generally handle network drivers.
Russell King and linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org probably handle
serial drivers considered for inclusion.
I don't have a particularly organized or sophisticated plan for a
staged merging of the drivers. If either should care to absorb the
drivers instead of merely acking them, it's just as well. Both will
generally see anything going across linux-kernel.
