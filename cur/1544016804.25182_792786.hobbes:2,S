While this is true, there are examples of places we should expect
speedups for this today.
Concurrent file creation/deletion in a single dir will often find things
hot in cache and not have to block anywhere (mail spools).
Concurrent O_DIRECT aio writes to the same file, where i_mutex is
dropped early on.
pipes should see a huge improvement.
I'll kick off some runs of my three benchmarks on ext3 for comparison.
If there are things less synthetic people would like to see, please let
me know.
