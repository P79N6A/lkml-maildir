I am sorry to see your recent dicussion style.
I was asking a question and I did get a completely useless answer as
any person who has some basic know how Linux SCSI would know that
doing a stat("/dev/sg*", ...) will not return anything useful.
If people give useful answers, it makes sense to continue a discussion but it 
turns out that "joe average" on KLML replies before thinking about the problem. 
Let me ask again:
	Is there a way to get (or construct) a closed view on the namespace 
	for all SCSI devices?
And IMPORTANT: don't answer unless you have a real answer for the problem.
