Perhaps not a conflict, but why guess...  fix the wording so it
is not ambiguous...

Perhaps.  There is no guarantee however.  Why play with
assumptions.  I agree with you that it would _probably_ be
interpreted as per the intention of the author.  By rewording it
however, ambiguity is removed and no interpretation or assumption
is needed.  This is my intention.

The GPL is the GPL.  If you solely create a piece of software,
and licence it under GPL, and then in the "licence" file, state
that "this program is licenced under the GNU GPL, with the
following restrictions - you may not do this, you may not do
that" - then YOU the AUTHOR are violating the GPL yourself.  Your
work is NOT protected by the official GPL if you modify it.  If
you modify the licence text, or impose restrictions - which you
are more than free to do - being the copyright holder, then you
MUST change the NAME OF THE LICENCE to something other than
General Public Licence, because the GPL licence itself is
copyright by Richard Stallman I believe.  Modifications to the
GPL licence can only be done by RMS or FSF I believe.
At any rate, who cares.  The point is reiserfs licence needs
rewording to be unambiguous.

That is more or less correct, however, back to the point - which
is that the licence is ambiguous, and can be fixed in a few
minutes time to not be so.

This PROVES my point.  The licence that reiserfs is under IS
AMBIGUOUS.  I read it, and see the author's intention to be that
it IS under the GNU GPL licence, however you state that it is NOT
under the GPL, but rather one that is more restrictive.
Thus 2 different people have interpreted the author's licencing
statement COMPLETELY differently, and thus the licencing
statement needs to be cleared up properly.  That is my point
entirely.

That may or may not be necessary.  If Hans intention is to have
the Linux reiserfs code be licenced under GPL, and simultaneously
available under an alternative licence, then the GPL licenced
reiserfs does not violate anything at all.  It just needs to be
stated more clearly, and include an actual copy of the legalese
of the licence.
If however, reiserfs under alternative licencing from the author,
is used with a Linux kernel, then there is definitely a problem.
Anyone distributing executable code such as a linux kernel, which
has been built from the GPL Linux kernel sources, and with
reiserfs (or any other addon code) which is licenced under a more
restrictive licence, or closed-source, then that particular
distribution of code or executable violates the licence indeed.
The only legal way that "may" be possible in this case is code
that is standalone from the kernel source, and does not modify
any kernel source files whatsoever, and which compiles cleanly
without incorporating any kernel code internally or linking with
it.  If this were made available as a binary only module, then it
would be sufficiently isolated.  I seem to remember something
about binary only addons to the kernel may or may not be "ok"
though.  If it is 100% standalone, then it is ok.
I beleive it is stated that if the purpose of a GPL'd driver is
to export internal kernel stuff to a proprietary binary only
driver or userland app, that this violates the kernel licence.
People could just write a minimal interface, GPL it, stick it in
the kernel or make it freely avail, and fully GPL compliant, but
which the purpose of is just to use their proprietary binary only
code with, and "bypass" the GPL restriction - then this is not
allowed.  I believe the MOSIX people tried to do something like
this before...

Hmm...  That may be true, but I didn't realize that until now.  I
hope that reiserfs indeed is GPL compliant, and that the licence
wording will be corrected.

I think once the licence is corrected (if it is - and I think it
was more of an oversight and will be fixed), then the only
possible violation that I can see, would be if someone contacted
Hans for an alternative licence to the code, and then linked that
particular bit of code to the Linux kernel source.  That would
violate the GPL that the kernel itself is under because the
combined kernel binary could not be re-released as a derivitive
work under GPL because the reiserfs code licence that was
"arranged" would not be GPL compatible ( or would it?)  I guess
it would depend on the wording of that licence too.
At any rate, some lawyers should help Hans out if there is indeed
any problem like this.
