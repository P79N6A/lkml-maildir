Hm, the big merge window for 2.6.17 is past.  If this is a
single-driver-only update, it might be argued that this should be
accepted into 2.6.17, but only after it has had a few weeks of testing
in -mm.  After a few weeks being in -mm however, it will be too late to
go into 2.6.17.
So, is 2.6.18 ok?
thanks,
