You may not think it's cool, but it's needed in order to
prevent deadlocks. Just because an allocation cannot do
disk IO or sleep, that's no reason to loop around like
crazy in __alloc_pages() and hang the machine ... ;)

That's a separate issue.  That was, IIRC, about the
failure of atomic allocations causing packet loss on
Linux routers and, because of that, poor performance.
This is something we still need to look into, but
basically this problem is about too high latency and
NOT about "pre-freeing" more pages (like your patch
attempts).  If this problem is still an issue, it's
quite likely that the VM is holding locks for too
long so that it cannot react fast enough to free up
some inactive_clean pages.

Rik
