So the fixmap allocator allocates contiguous pagetables. Wasn't my

Yes I think so. one_page_table_init will not allocate a new pte page if
one already exists, so it will not be contiguous with previous/subsequent
pages with the early fixmap pte there. page_table_range_init explains why
that is a problem (this code seems terribly fragile and prone to breakage
but I don't want to expend theeffort on it -- still, I have a patch to
panic the kernel if it breaks its guarantee of contiguous page tables,
which makes breakage easily visible).
