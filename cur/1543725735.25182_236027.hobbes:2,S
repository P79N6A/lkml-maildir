hi,
i am using the debian linux and am working on the 2.6.6 kernel.
i want to access the tcp header, modify it (by passing it through my
function) and then
put it back for the regular flow to continue.
can somebody tell me where i can access TCP header....
this is what i think should be done.
1.will using (struct sk_buff*)skb->h.th be sufficient
2.using hook to divert the regular flow.
3.passing it to my function.
4.putting it back.
am i right???
-best regards,
manjunath
