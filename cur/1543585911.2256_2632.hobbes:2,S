Irritating, isn't it?

No.  A reboot is required.
It is due to a problem in the APIC handling.  There is a 
workaround in the 2.4.2-ac series which fixes it.  It
appears to not be in the 2.4.3 series.  So for the
while you'll have to either install a recent -ac kernel
or boot with the `noapic' LILO option.
