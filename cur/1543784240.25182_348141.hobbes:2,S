Looks like UDMA/100 is set up fine for both your drives.

This is normal.  hdparm doesn't know much about SCSI drives... SATA drives are
closer to SCSI than IDE.  In particular the various direct IDE ioctls are not
supported by the SCSI layer.  Don't worry about these errors.

See above.

Sorry, I thought your drive might be blacklisted, but I didn't actually check
the driver for your model.  You are getting UDMA/100 so your drive is just
fine, no firmware update is required.  If you were interested though, poking 
around seagates site would probably turn up some firmware updates, if any are
available.  I did have a blacklisted seagate drive, but it works fine after
the firmware update and removal from the blacklist.
