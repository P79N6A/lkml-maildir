This is indeed an even bigger problem.  LVM is no longer just
a Sistina product, it is an integrated part of the Linux kernel.
This brings with it the responsability of maintaining the LVM
subsystem which is included in the kernel. I understand that
Sistina may want to do "LVM releases" every once in a while,
but this isn't a development model that makes much sense when
their code has been integrated into the Linux kernel (IMHO).

If you think any other openly accessible LVM development things
are needed (maybe a CVS tree which can be used by all LVM
developers and not just the Sistina folks?) .. NL.linux.org is
all yours.
