That's just plain screwy.  Gigabit doesn't use crossover cables *AT 
ALL*, although some of them *tolerate* the green and orange pairs being 
crossed for compatibility with older crossover cables.  However, the 
cable above is just plain weird.  There is absolutely no reason to cross 
the blue and brown pair.
If you know both ends are gigabit, always use a straight-through cable. 
  If you know at least one end is gigabit (or auto MDI/MDIX), you can 
almost always use a straight-through cable as well.  Use crossover 
cables for 10/100 equipment only.
