There's a typo on the code.  Change 'fmaily' to 'family' and you'll be
all set.
On the other note, does anyone have a pointer to a collection of
patches made *after* the 11xx98 release of the 2.0 and/or 2.1 code?
I've got a lynx program which will run maybe once before giving me
a seg fault on startup.  
It worked once, not sure why though.  And what's worse is that it
wouldn't run again after that!
