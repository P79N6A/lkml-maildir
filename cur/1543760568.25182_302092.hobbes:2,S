2nd that, I'm so delighted to have -stable that I will happily accept 
patches of what ever type you find easiest to produce, in this case 
sequential incrementals. Just don't screw the process by changing it, we 
can cope! Anyone who can't figure out how to generate the single big 
diff against mainline shouldn't be patching kernels ;-)

I think Linus noted his intention to grab the fixes he likes. That's not 
a determanent process by any means ;-)
