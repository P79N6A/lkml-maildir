i've uploaded a simple utility to set the RT_CPU rlimit, called
execrtlim:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/rt-limit-patches/
execrtlim can be used to test the rlimit, e.g.:
  ./execrtlim 10 10 /bin/bash
will spawn a new shell with RLIMIT_RT_CPU curr/max set to 10%/10%.
on older kernels the utility prints:
  $ ./execrtlim 10 10 /bin/bash
  execrtlim: kernel does not support RLIMIT_RT_CPU.
