  Yep noticed that here too. As you pointed out it seems to be related
to threaded apps. ls, vi, ... work fine whereas xemacs or others are
real slow, portmapper fails to respond, ...
  I've got no indication in the logs that something went wrong, nor
do I see any kernel BUG or WARNING.
  My box is a dual 2.8GHz HT xeon w/ 2GB mem.
  rt29 was fine as is 2.6.17-rc6.
  I feel a bit perplexed here.
  Sébastien.
