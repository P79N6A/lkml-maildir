Did you look at Stephen Tweedie's sard work (from 
ftp.uk.linux.org:/pub/linux/sct/fs/sard*) ?

I think a far more interesting metric ATM is locking overhead. I have
a patch (based on original code from Andrea Arcangeli) that adds knowledge
about the locking segment to the time accounting code and outputs it in
/proc/stat. I also have some X11 hacks to display the locking overhead
graphically. Profiling spinlocks could be a very useful addition,
unfortunately it needs source changes to every spinlock setup.
Accounting system calls is not too useful I think, more interesting
would be to break the kernel time into "IO time", "bottom half time" (this
is currently accounted to some random process) etc.  We don't want to 
add too much cruft to the timer interrupt handler though.
