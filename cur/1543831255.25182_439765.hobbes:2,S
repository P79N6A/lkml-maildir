I see where you are heading with this. But on the principle of minimal
suprise this is not good. Why does it not include file.o in the link
when I mark it phony?
The root cause is buried in the powerpc/boot/Makefile restructuring.
I do not see what is wrong with current approch if you do a simple
s/cmd/if_changed/g and then assign targets += <relevant targets>
You need to post a full diff of the Makefile before I can give better
feedback.
