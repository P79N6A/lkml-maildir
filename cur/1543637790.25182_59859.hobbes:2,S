Lionel,
as you already figured out, looking at the northbridge IDs is simply
not sufficient to find out which capabilities and register layout the
IDE controller in the southbridge (no matter if integrated or external)
has.
Some comments:
1) the 745 has an integrated southbridge and an ATA/100 capable IDE
controller
2) the 646 (and most likely the 645 and others as well) may be paired
with a 961 (ATA/100) or 961B (ATA133) MutIOL southbridge with different
register programming values.
Thus simply ripping out some northbridge IDs wouldn't prevent
corruption problems.
Ciao,
  Dani
