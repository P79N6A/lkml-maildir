I take that back. Even a file manager may very well be interested in moves 
that it does itself - most of them have some soft of multi-window view 
capability, and if they use dnotify, they might well be using it to keep 
the different views coherent.
So yes, a new flag would likely be required. 
That said, who actually _uses_ dnotify? The only time dnotify seems to 
come up in discussions is when people complain how badly designed it is, 
and I don't think I've ever heard anybody say that they use it and 
that they liked it ;)
