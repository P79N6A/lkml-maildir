But only for people and programs with root privileges.  It all turns
then, on whether we want to insist that all software doing hardware 
probing must have root privileges to function.
I submit that the answer is "no" -- the right direction, for security
and other reasons, is to make *fewer* capabilities dependent on root
privileges rather than more, and to reject design approaches that
imply creating more suid programs to give ordinary users capabilities
that involve only *reading* config information.
There is already stuff in /proc that seems to be there for precisely this
reason.  So /proc/dmi would hardly be a violation of norms.
