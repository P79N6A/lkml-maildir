   In implementations i know off, the first in the queue waiting for the cond 
   variable to be signalled is restarted. But depending on the implementation
   one can considering waking up a thread so as to utilise the system resources
   in a * optimal * manner.
   This is all the more true, because, if multiple threads are waiting for a 
   condition to occur and only one pthread_cond_signal comes in, the signalling
   thread is not intersted in waking up any * particular * thread.
 thanks,
 Rama.
