Gentlemen, let's _stop_ it. About the only non-obvious thing said during
the whole thread was the claim that revoke() will take ~20 lines. While I
_seriously_ doubt it (having spent quite a few months hacking on the areas
in question) I would like to hear how to do that. All (partial, mind you)
patches I've seen were 2 orders of magnitude larger. Andrea, could you
share the method to do it?
