the validator just found another problem with this lock, pointing out 
that files_lock nests inside of proc_subdir_lock, and that files_lock is 
a softirq-unsafe lock, creating another (unlikely but possible) deadlock 
scenario:
 =====================================
 [ BUG: lock inversion bug detected! ]
 -------------------------------------
 grep/2290 just changed the state of lock {proc_subdir_lock} at:
  [<c0196e53>] remove_proc_entry+0x33/0x1f0
 but this lock took lock {files_lock} in the past,
 acquired at: [<c0196ece>] remove_proc_entry+0xae/0x1f0
 and interrupts could create an inverse lock dependency between them,
 which could lead to deadlocks!
 other info that might help in debugging this:

to solve this we must either change files_lock to be softirq-safe too 
(bleh!), or we must forbid remove_proc_entry() use from softirq 
contexts. Neither is a happy solution - remove_proc_entry() is used 
within free_irq(), and who knows how many drivers do free_irq() in 
softirq/tasklet context ...
Andrew, this needs to be resolved before v2.6.16, correct? Steve's patch 
solves a real bug in the upstream kernel.
