Hi Mark,
There is a standard place for system-wide SLAB caches -
include/linux/slab.h (grep for "System wide") - please move that extern in
there because kernel/exit.c includes malloc.h which is really slab.h so it
should be okay.
Also, Linus was saying that it would be nice to combine the
subsystem-specific SLAB cache creations in one place. I have done this for
VFS in vfs_caches_init() - perhaps you could do that VM? Just an idea...
Regards,
Tigran
