Yes, that's exactly right. Suspend relies upon inline always inlining,
and as I work around I added...
#undef inline
#define inline __inline__ __attribute__(always_inline))
while this discussion was going on. I should switch this to
always_inline now that it's merged.

Many today claim to be tolerant. But true tolerance can cope with others
being intolerant.
