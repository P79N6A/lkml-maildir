The problem is that the reporting is confused -- the MB number is
bytes / 2^20, but the GB number is MB / 10.  Either the MB number
should be changed to bytes / 10^6, or the GB number should be
changed to MB / 2^10.
Or is there some compelling reason for GB to be *neither* binary
(technical gigabytes) *nor* decimal (marketing gigabytes)?
E.g. I have a drive which IBM calls "9.1 GB" which Linux reports as:
SCSI device sdb: hdwr sector= 512 bytes. Sectors= 17916240 [8748 MB] [8.7 GB]
17916240 * 512 = 9173114880 (bytes) = ~9.2 "decimal" gigabytes
= ~8748 "binary" megabytes = ~8.5 "binary" gigabytes
Regardless of which system one prefers, 8.7 GB is simply wrong.
