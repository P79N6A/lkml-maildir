Ok, I am not sure but there is a possibility of having the vboxdrv driver
loaded. _But_ I was not using, i.e., I do not use VirtualBox.  In my
attempts to reproduce the issue, I tried to load this module but, unfortunatly,
my distro has this package broken ATM (err... in fact, the problem is not the
distro but me - I am using an unstable version).
vboxdrv could be a problem if I was using it, but I believe it shouldn't cause
this if it is not being used... but it's just a guess.
