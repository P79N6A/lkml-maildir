STREAMS numbers tricky. It's pretty much the only benchmark that 1)
relies on being able to allocate alot of RAM in a NUMA-friendly way 2)
does all of its memory allocation in the first timeslice of cloned
worker threads.
There is little help we get from userspace, and i'm not sure we want to
add scheduler overhead for this single benchmark - when something like a
_tiny_ bit of NUMAlib use within the OpenMP library would probably solve
things equally well!
Anyway, the code itself looks fine and it would be good if it improved
things, so:
 Acked-by: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
but this too needs alot of testing, and it the one that has the highest
likelyhood of actually not making it upstream.
