My gut reaction to ckrm is the same as yours.  But there's been a lot of
work put into this and if we're to flatly reject the feature then the
developers are owed a much better reason than "eww yuk".
Otherwise, if there are certain specific problems in the code then it's
best that they be pointed out now rather than later on.
What, in your opinion, makes it "obviously unmregeable"?
