For a not so contrived example, look at email delivery.  Some mailservers do
all work as root (or some fixed email user)
Some servers will switch to the UID of the user receiving the message, 
limiting the
damage in case of buffer overflow etc. A fair amount of work is then done
as that user - running the message through virus/spam-checks and
then perhaps procmail.
