Hmm.. so what you mean is being able to have a filesystem called (for example)
/somewhere, and being able to mount /somewhere/deep/path/like/this on a
mountpoint /wherever/else, but without having /somewhere mounted itself?
That looks *almost* doable, except that things like quotas or the free
block list would be a hassle if then you also went and mounted
/somewhere/deep/other/path on /something/else
Or did you want to do 'mount /somewhere/deep /wherever/else' when it's
/wherever that isn't actually mounted?  This looks more.. umm.. interesting,
as you could (for instance) use an automounter to mount /home/fred, /home/george
/home/sally, and not actually need a /home?  But don't current automounters
almost do this already?
