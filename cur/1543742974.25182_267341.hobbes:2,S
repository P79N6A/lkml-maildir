The lock chains aren't that deep in Linux so the algorithmic complexity
is not going to hit some crazy polynomial time unless there's some seriously
nasty contention at a certain point in the kernel (billions of readers for
example against a write aquire). But when we start to see things like that
under pressure is when we need to start shortening the need for that/those
lock(s) for that/those critical section(s) in question.
