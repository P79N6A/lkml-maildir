I guess we all have our weaknesses, mine is off-by-one errors, which are 
a bad thing when writing code for a statistics class at school ;)

Yeah, thats right, it spins forever on both my athlon-tbird and my 
athlon64 (in x86_64 mode). I'll take another look at the code tonight, 
to see if I can figure out why its causing this, or another way of 
incurring the delay you're looking for.
