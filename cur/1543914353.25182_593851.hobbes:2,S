Hi Mathieu,
Sure, but why is that the caller's problem?  immediate_set() isn't
fastpath, so why not make it do an "if (early_boot)" internally?

Sure, but it seems like that's fairly easy to do within module.c:
/* This updates all the immediates even though only one might have
* changed.  But it's so rare it's not worth optimizing. */
void module_update_immediates(void)
{
mutex_lock(&module_mutex);
list_for_each_entry(mod, &modules, list)
update_immediates(mod->immediate, mod->num_immediate);
mutex_unlock(&module_mutex);
}
Then during module load you do:
update_immediates(mod->immediate, mod->num_immediate);
Your immediate_update() just becomes:
update_immediates(__start___immediate,
		  __stop___immediate - __start___immediate);
module_update_immediates();
update_immediates() can grab the immediate_mutex if you want.

I was thinking that we might find useful specific cases before we get
GCC support, which archs can override with tricky asm if they wish.
Cheers,
Rusty.
