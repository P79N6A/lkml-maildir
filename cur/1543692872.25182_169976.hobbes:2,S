[meaning /proc/self/fd/%s instead]
In that case, don't you already have a severe mess?
For example, some kind of fd-related signal needs to
be delivered to the shared queue. So that happens,
but who can tell which "fd 42" it belongs with?
IMHO, if you want separate files, CLONE_THREAD should
not be in your clone() flags. (and then users call the
resulting thing a group of processes that share stuff,
instead of calling it a single process)
Also consider what the "fuser" and "lsof" programs must
do if threads don't share file descriptors. Ow, ow, ow!!!
These programs must scan /proc/*/task/*/fd/* to find all
open files. If threads share files, then "only" the tgid
level must be scanned.
