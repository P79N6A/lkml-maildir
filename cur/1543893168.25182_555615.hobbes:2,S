Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/10/34

The following patch series contains:
- dyntick bugfixes for -mm (caused by the cpuidle changes in ACPI)
- updates and improvements to high resolution timer / dynticks 
- high resolution timer / dynticks support for x86_64
The x86_64 support is based on an initial patch from Chris Wright. Thanks Chris !
The patch set has been tested in the -hrt and -rt trees for quite a while
and the initial problems have been sorted out. Thanks to the folks from the
PowerTop project for testing and feedback.
The -hrt tree at 
http://www.tglx.de/projects/hrtimers/2.6.22-rc4/
 contains
also an hpet force patch series from Venki Pallipadi, but I leave this up to
Venki to send it mainline wards.
Thanks,
	tglx
