The functions: insw(), insl(), outsw(), outsl()  perform memory block
copy, and are used in 
a lot of drivers. In the PowerPC version of linux theses fuinctions are
defined to change the endianess
of data being proceeded (the endianess is changed with a byte swapping
operator).
Is this correct to change the endianess of data ? Is a specification
available to define the behaviour of
theses functions for different linux architectures.
In my opinion theses functions are generally used to do a fast byte
copy, in this case
doing a byte-swapping of data break a lot of programs.
