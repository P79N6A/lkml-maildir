i have reproduced one fs corrupter and a temporary workaround is in
2.3.24. I first suspected that the high memory patch did it, but it turned
out that unmap_underlying_metadata() hack either introduced or triggered
data/metadata corruption. (take a look at the buffer.c change) I cannot
reproduce any filesystem corruption with 2.3.24 - could you try it without
ikd?
