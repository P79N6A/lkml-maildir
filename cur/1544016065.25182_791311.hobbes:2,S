Sam, Andrew, David, what's your workflow preference for these bits?
While they are oneliners and i could create a separate branch for these 
and pull Jaswinder's tree (and do build coverage to make sure there's no 
surprised on any arch), it's really up to the maintainers of these files 
to decide on the workflow.
I'd lean towards doing this via the individual maintainers and/or -mm, but 
no strong feelings ...
Even if it's done via a separate tree at minimum it needs the acks from 
the affected maintainers.
