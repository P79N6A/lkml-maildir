Looking further through the pre patch I have found the following:
diff -Nru a/fs/dquot.c b/fs/dquot.c
--- a/fs/dquot.c	Wed Apr  3 17:11:14 2002
+++ b/fs/dquot.c	Wed Apr  3 17:11:14 2002
...
+static ctl_table fs_table[] = {
+ 
{FS_NRDQUOT, "dquot-nr", &nr_dquots, 2*sizeof(int),
+ 
  0444, NULL, &proc_dointvec},
+ 
{},
+};
What the heck is "dquot-nr"?
The breakup between the two abbreviations is not nice for the following reasons:
1. Invention of - is redundant becouse the whole thing is an abbreviation
    anyway.
2. It violates C/perl/whatever rules for item names.
3. The order of "nr" "preposition" and the "-" after the item is not consistant
    with the actual usage in application code!
The surrounding FS_NRDQUOT and nr_dquots show nicely that replacing
"dquot-nr" with "nrdquot" would fit much better and be much more consistant
with the implicite naming conventions used by programmers. Far easier
to grasp becouse there is no such thing as a disk quota of numbers...
Just nit-picking and ducking... ;-)
