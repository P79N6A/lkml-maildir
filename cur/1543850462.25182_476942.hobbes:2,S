Sorry for the inconvenience of the wiki page, it just didn't seem to be
proper to attach the whole archive to the email.
While trying to get this thing to compile, I didn't notice the files in
the include subfolder, as they never appeared to be included in the
compile... I will analyze the source some more. 
I hope we can do something useful with this mess, they have a
specification data sheet on their website.
Thank you.
