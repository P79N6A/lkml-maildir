Yep, that's how the via audio problem was solved, with a mixer
semaphore.  Having your interrupt handler touch ac97_codec definitely
complicates things beyond that simple solution, though.  If your only
concern is the intr handler you could create a dont-touch-ac97-in-intr
flag, and set that flag (only) via spin_lock_irq.  Then you don't
have to stay inside a spinlock the entire time.
