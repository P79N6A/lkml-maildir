struct cycles_struct {
	int cpu;
	cycles_t cycles;
};
void local_get_cycles(void *ptr)
{
	struct cycles_struct *data = (struct cycles_struct *)ptr;
	if (data->cpu == smp_processor_id())
		data->cycles = get_cycles();
}	
static inline cycles_t smp_get_cycles(int cpu)
{
	struct cycles_struct data = { cpu };
	if (cpu == smp_processor_id())
		return get_cycles();
	smp_call_function(&local_get_cycles, &data, 0, 1);
	return data.cycles;
}

This takes about 21msec on my dual PIII-550. Note that
smp_call_function is supposed to be portable but currently only exists
on alpha, i386 and ia64.
One question (I haven't looked at your patch): can it deal gracefully
with suspending the machine, turning it off, then resuming? I don't
think that you can do that yet on SMP but I hope that you soon will
(ACPI or the software suspend patch).
