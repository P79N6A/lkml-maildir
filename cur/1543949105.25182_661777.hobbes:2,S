That means we need both the anon_vma locks and the i_mmap_lock to become 
semaphores. I think semaphores are better than mutexes. Rik and Lee saw 
some performance improvements because list can be traversed in parallel 
when the anon_vma lock is switched to be a rw lock.
Sounds like we get to a conceptually clean version here?
