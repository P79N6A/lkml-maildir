OK, but I was not worrying about the interactivity aspects, rather the
performance aspects (GUI updates of KDE 3.5.2 on P3/450/256MB on Ubuntu are
about as slow as medium-hot lava). While of course it's mostly KDE (and
probably also the S3 Savage driver/card) which is to blame here,
I'm trying to first do as much as possible at kernel level before eventually
going higher up the chain...
