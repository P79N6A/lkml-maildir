the problem is that the filesystem code will replay the journal when you 
mount the partition, even if you mount it read-only (I seem to remember 
that you could avoid this if you put the entire block device into 
read-only mode, but that doesn't help in this case)

I thought we were talking about actually invoking the suspend-to-ram

right, and the answer is that the filesystem blocks allocated for the 
suspend image are not allowed to be accessed in any way from the main 
system.
this is a good argument for saving the data somewhere else ;-)

no, you want to make the blocks that are allocated for the suspend image 
be like the blocks allocated to the journal, alloate them once and never 
touch them again
you especially do not want to try and write something to them from the 
main system just before suspending, you don't know enough about what it 
takes to get the data to the media to be absolutly sure that it's there 
when the save-and-restore kernel goes to look.

and keep in mind that "write to these blocks" can be done in userspace, it 
doesn't require the kernel to do this.
