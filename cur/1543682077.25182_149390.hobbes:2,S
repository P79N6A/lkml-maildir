I would think so!
The patch that fixed the issue with the key release events was this -
I submitted it to Alan who then put it into ac and then it went into
2.4.x...
Details:

Patch excerpt:
+                /* The following 'if' is a workaround for hardware
+                 * which sometimes send the key release event twice */
+                unsigned char next_scancode = scancode|up_flag;
+                if (up_flag && next_scancode==prev_scancode) {
+                       /* unexpected 2nd release event */
+                } else {
+                        prev_scancode=next_scancode;
+                        put_queue(next_scancode);
+                }
I haven't checked if 2.6.0 already has this!
