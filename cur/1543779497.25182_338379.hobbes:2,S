That is not clear yet. We need to discuss that. First I thought of just
having a patch that creates /proc/<pid>/numa_policy which allows
to read and write the process policy (write via notifier not directly).

e/smap is a generic way to get information about storage use of a vma. 
Therefore displaying numa node information etc there makes a lot of 
sense.

Yes. I initially had something like that in mind and have a partial 
implementation but such an approach gets extremely complicated and 
difficult to handle since you need to create multiple 
levels of directories in /proc/<pid>/xx. It is easier to obtain the 
complete memory information from a single file. We already have that in 
/proc/<pid>/maps.
