One of the two diffs below, I guess.  Please do a `patch -R -p1' of this
email and retest?

Michal, can you please add this to the regression list?

    [SCSI] aacraid: superfluous adapter reset for IBM 8 series ServeRAID controllers
    The kexec patch introduced a superfluous (and otherwise inert) reset of
    some adapters. The register can have a hardware default value that has
    zeros for the undefined interrupts. This patch refines the test of the
    interrupt enable register to focus on only the interrupts that affect
    the driver in order to detect if an incomplete shutdown of the Adapter
    had occurred (kdump).

    [SCSI] aacraid: kexec fix (reset interrupt handler)
    Another layer on this onion also discovered by Duane, the
    interrupt enable handler also needed to be set ... The interrupt enable
    was called from within the synchronous command handler.
