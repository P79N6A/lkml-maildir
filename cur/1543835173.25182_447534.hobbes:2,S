Yes, but I have been surprised that linux conference attendees all know
about reiser4, so I think it is consistent with the notion that reiser4
usage may well be much much higher than one would expect of a filesystem
that is not in the main tree, and which requires a lot of hassle to
install.  It is a datapoint.  I think the level of hobbyist enthusiasm
seen suggests that distros may gain market advantage by adding reiser4
support.....
