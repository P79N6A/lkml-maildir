Whatever would be correct for the driver.
In the general case of serial drivers, we can probably get away with
removing the port, but I think it'll need a couple of changes to
serial_core to prevent any spurious accesses to the device.
In the case of 8250_pci, slightly changing the way the remove method
works will probably be sufficient, provided the above is also fixed.
So, there _are_ things which can be done, and it requires someone
knowledgeable about the driver to work them out.  Handling this case
is NOT a janitorial task by any means.

No it isn't.  What could the high level resume code do?  Call the driver's
remove method?  Some driver remove methods hit the hardware as well, so
that wouldn't be _any_ different to the current situation of not checking
the pci_enable_device() return code.

As I said, an oops.  The nature of this oops could result in:
- user data being destroyed.
- prevention any driver being subsequently loaded or unloaded.
The approach that people are taking at the moment seems to be:
- let's make some random functions __must_check
- oh dear we get lots of warnings
- we must do something to shut these warnings up
- lets think of something and apply it without thought to all drivers
  introducing a lot of potential oops-creating scenarios
We are far better off with the warning - at least there is *something*
to tell driver authors that they need to fix their code.
