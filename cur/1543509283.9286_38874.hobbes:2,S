Hi,
I have a keyboard which is connected to 2 servers with a mechanical switch.
One of them is my Linux box - every time, i must switch, the keyboard rate
is slowed down.
So i looked into the keyboard drivers to know, how I can set the repeat
rate.
I found the ioctl KDKBDRATE ( or was it ...SETRATE?), but i found no code in
the drivers,
where the repeat rate will be set, after initialisation.
Is this right or i didn't looked at the right place?
