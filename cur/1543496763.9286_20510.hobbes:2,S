	Hmm, I probably have NO clue what I'm talking about, but it would seem
to me that in general, SMP machines have more memory than uni-processor
machines because in general they play a different role.  A uni-processor machine
is going to have 32M or 64M probably, whereas a dual-proc machine is going
to have 128M+ most likely.  Why?  Because if you're going dual-proc there is
usually a reason, perhaps it's for a server, or a high-end workstation or
something, but there is usually a reason, and that reason usually follows that
the machine will have more memory.
	Also, memory is (relatively) inexpensive compared to processors.
Which also makes me think that dual processor machines are going to have more
memory than uni-processor machines.
	How much memory are we talking here, anyway?  And how many processor
cycles? :)
