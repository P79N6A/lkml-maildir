In lots of case, you don't have an operator smart enough to make this
decision nowadays, and even if you had, for things like your SCSI
adapter, you just can't expect userland to be operational. The error
recovery policy should be buildable in the driver. If it's not, however,
then I agree that userland intervention is probably a good idea.
Note that on pSeries, we have no choice. On error, the slot is isolated.
So we can't let the driver continue anyway.
Ben.
