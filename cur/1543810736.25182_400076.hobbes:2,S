Subject: [PATCH 0/13] ACPI objects for SATA/PATA
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch series is primarily ACPI objects support for SATA/PATA.
It applies to 2.6.16-rc4.
ACPI objects for SATA/PATA add support for the _GTF, _SDD,
_GTM, and _STM ACPI methods.  ACPI methods are used to:
PATA:  get and set channel timings and modes and taskfiles
SATA:  get and set drive data and taskfiles
Taskfile operations are not limited.  Examples that I have
seen are (not limited to):
- power management:
  . enable or disable drive-initiated power management
- performance:
  . enable drive cache; set transfer mode (PIO/DMA)
- security
  . lock the disk access password
There is also an addition here to send a Standby Immediate
command to SATA/PATA drives during shutdown.  This should be
done (at least for some drives) to cause a safe and orderly
shutdown of the drive heads (i.e., protect data).
Caveat:  Some people are reporting good results from these
patches.  Unfortunately I have problems with them myself.
My test platforms usually suspend successfully but they
don't resume successfully.  Oh, and there may be a BUG
during sleep-shutdown processing where a sleep happens
while a spinlock is held.
These patches definitely need some time in -mm, but be
prepared to revert them or to use
	libata.noacpi=1
to disable them.  Also, please use
	libata.printk=0xff
to enable full debug messages.
If you want to test this without using -mm, you can either
apply the patch series (13 patches) or one rolled-up
(combined) patch.  The combined patch is available at:
http://www.xenotime.net/linux/SATA/2.6.16-rc4/libata-rollup-2616-rc4.patch
Still TBD:  more calls to ata_acpi_push_timing(), e.g.,
during resume, to set PATA hard drive timing and mode.
And fix the BUG above.
