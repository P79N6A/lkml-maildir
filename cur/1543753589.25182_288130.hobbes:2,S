Thanks for the update.

scheduler_tick() is not only called by the timer interrupt but also form
the fork code. Is this intended? I think the accounting for
iso_refractory is wrong. Isn't calling it from
timer.c::update_process_times() better?
And shouldn't real RT task also counted? If RT tasks use 40% cpu you can
lockup the system as unprivileged user with SCHED_ISO because it doesn't
reach the 70% cpu limit.
Futher on i see a fundamental problem with this accounting for
iso_refractory. What if i manage as unprivileged user to run a SCHED_ISO
task which consumes all cpu and only sleeps very short during the timer
interrupt? I think this will nearly lockup or very slow down the system.
The iso_cpu limit can't guaranteed.
My simple yield DoS don't work anymore. But i found another way.
Running this as SCHED_ISO:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sched.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <sys/resource.h>
struct timeval tv;
int a, b, i0, i1;
int cpuusage ()
{
	struct rusage ru;
	getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF, &ru);
	return ru.ru_utime.tv_usec + ru.ru_stime.tv_usec;
}
int main ()
{
	while(1) {
		a = tv.tv_sec;
		b = tv.tv_usec;
		gettimeofday(&tv, 0);
		i0 = i1;
		i1 = cpuusage();
		if (i0 != i1) {
//			printf("%d.%06d\t%d.%06d\t%d\t%d\n",
//			       a, b, (int)tv.tv_sec, (int)tv.tv_usec, i0, i1);
		}
	}
}
It stalled the system for a few seconds and the drop it to SCHED_OTHER.
Then start a additional SCHED_OTHER cpu hog (while true; do : ; done).
The system locks up after a few seconds.
sysrq-n causes a reboot.
