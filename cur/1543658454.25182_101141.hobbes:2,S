Hi all,
Is it possible to open a character device in kernel space without 
actually openning the device file? Because I don't wan to hold the usage 
count of a particular mount or dcache.
This is what I planned to do,
    struct file fake_devfile = {0};
    struct dentry fake_dentry = {0};
    struct inode fake_inode = {0};
    /* Link up fake file,dentry, inode */
    fake_file.f_dentry=&fake_dentry;
    fake_dentry.d_inode=&fake_inode;
Then I will call the f_op of the character device directly, please give 
advice. Thanks.
regards,
David Chow
