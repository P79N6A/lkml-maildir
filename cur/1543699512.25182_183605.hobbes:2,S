From what Dave says, usb_reset_device shouldn't take dev->serialize (but
accidentally does via usb_set_configuration).  That seems strange to me:
I thought the point of usbfs taking dev->serialize is to protect against the
device settings changing, but now we have usb_reset_device that doesn't
take dev->serialize at all - and surely it changes the device settings!
With much confusion,
Duncan.
