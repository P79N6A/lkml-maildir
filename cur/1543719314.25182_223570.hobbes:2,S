We're always open to adding new features but we're not going to code around
delibrate misuse of the system.  We wouldn't be doing you any favors by 
doing so.  If you ever migrate off of BK then you'll need the next system
to have those same workarounds.
Go educate Linus that he got this one wrong, he's a reasonable guy, he
listens if enough people scream.
