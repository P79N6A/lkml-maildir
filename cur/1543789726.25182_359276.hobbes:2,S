Subject: Patch: ATI Xilleon port 2/11 net/e100 Memory barriers and write flushing
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is the second part of my Xilleon port.
I am sending the full set of patches to linux-mips@linux-mips.org
which is archived at: 
http://www.linux-mips.org/archives/
Only the patches that touch generic parts of the kernel are coming
here.
The Xilleon (32bit MIPS SOC) has a write back buffer that seems to
operate on the pci bus and does not get flushed before a read.  The
result is that a memory barrier must be done before a read intended to
flush PCI writes.
The second problem is that writes need to be flushed in e100_exec_cmd.
I am not sure exactly what was going wrong, but without this patch
packets in the send queue were not being sent until... Well I don't
know exactly when, but reception of packets and interrupts by other devices on
the PCI bus seemed to get them to be kicked out.
The result was that when pinging from an external host, the round trip
time was usually the same as the ping interval (i.e. one second).
This lead to very poor NFS performance.
With the patch applied the ethernet seems to work flawlessly
Patch against 2.6.14-rc2 from linux-mips.org

Memory barriers and write flushing added for use with xilleon port.
