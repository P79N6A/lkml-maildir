Subject: 2.4.33pre1 kernel/sysctl.c missing spin_unlock()

possibly fixed yet, but maybe not:
in above patch there was a spinlock(&sysctl_lock) added in 
function do_register_sysctl_table(), but no corresponding 
spin_unlock() before return.
after starting the new kernel (unfortunately with further 
patches), it hangs on trying to start the kswapd-thread.
after inserting the spin_unlock() all run fine.
