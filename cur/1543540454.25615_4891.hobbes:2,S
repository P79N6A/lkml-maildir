Hi,
  my Debian woody (modutils 2.3.11-8) is very unsatisfied with symlink 
build in /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build. It walks through complete
linux source tree, loudly complaining that file such and such is not
owned by root or that file such and such is not ELF file :-( I see
in Documentation/Changes that 2.3.10 is still lowest required version,
so are Debian packages excluded from this or should we move build
link somewhere else? Or 'depmod -a' have to be fixed to skip (a) all
symlinks or (b) 'build'... (I recently saw discussion about 2.3.13 required -
- is it true?)
  Just FYI... It takes about minute during bootup, as it has to read
really big chunk of data :-(
  Except that (modulo kmod.c) system works fine...
                                            Best regards,
                                                Petr Vandrovec
