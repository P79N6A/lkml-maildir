Hi!
I've created little project for read-only (for now ;-) bitkeeper
clone. It is available at www.sf.net/projects/bitbucket (no tar balls,
just get it fresh from CVS).
Part of readme follows.
Install CSSC from <
http://cssc.sf.net/>
 (it is also available as
Debian package). You may need to apply cssc.diff.
Here you get following tools:
bcheckout_HEAD:
        extracts files from BK repository. You can get repository
        by rsync -zav --delete nl.linux.org::kernel/linux-2.5 .
bpull:
        pull new version of repository, compute differences from
        the last time and apply them to directory with *your*
        sources.
bdiff:
        compare two versions (specify versions from top-level
        s.ChangeSet)
To get a list of all changesets, do prs linux-2.5/SCCS/s.ChangeSet.
Enjoy, and help me make it usefull,
								Pavel
