I don't have a problem with the omission.  mremap is logically
equivalent to munmap + mmap, so it's a subset of the "I unmapped
underneath my futex!".  It's not like it's going to happen without the
caller knowing: if the address doesn't change, then the futexes won't
break.  If they do, the caller needs to reset them anyway.
Cheers,
Rusty.
