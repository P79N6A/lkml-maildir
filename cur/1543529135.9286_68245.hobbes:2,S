Hi Linus, (and list members)
The patch below addresses all known functional issues with the ramdisk
and passes all tests I can think of.
What it doesn't solve, is a (design?) weakness whereby the ramdisk can
cause swap looping if it's trying to grow_buffers() to dynamically
allocate blocks during high memory pressure times.  This is exposed
by swapping madly (ultimate test) to a ramdisk.  It passes the test
just fine iff I populate the ramdisk (dd) prior to mkswap/swapon on
the device.  I'm running the result of make -j3 bzImage MAKE='make -j3'
with the ramswap being enabled/disabled/enabled repeatedly during build,
migrating it's content to a lower priority swap partiton and back.
Changes:
Unconditionally retrieve/create/populate buffers during rd_request.
This resolves a problem whereby a ramdisk filled with an fs image
then wiped and re-filled has files full of zeros.  My understanding
of the buffer cache + page cache == unified cache is too shaky to
explain this at all.  My _impression_ is that the total cache state
must be stored in the ramdisk (lives in buffer cache portion of total)
for it to work properly (ie aliases=state problem).  This is as shaky
as explanations come, but that's what I'm trying to do, and it works.
(Tigran tested/confirmed that it resolves that problem)
Added igrab()/iput() to protect the ramdisk inodes from prune_icache()
when ramdisks are present but inactive.
Added setup option for blocksize when ramdisk is in kernel such that
options are the same as what's available as a module.  This is needed
if you want to swap to ramdisk when it's in kernel.. a valid way to
test swap performance on a machine with terrible/old disk drives :)
Tiny cleanups.
If anything is horrible from the OS designer viewpoint, punt me in the
right direction and I'll try to do better.  Patch is below.
	Thanks for your time,
	-Mike

-	 *    Write - Mark the buffer as "Protected".

-	 * 2. Supplied buffer mismatched one in the buffer cache:
-	 *    Read - Copy the data from the buffer cache entry.
-	 *    Write - Copy the data to the buffer cache entry.
