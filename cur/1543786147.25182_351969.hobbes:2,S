Hi
	This driver works perfectly if you insert the physical card on a PCI slot. If 
you insert this same card on a PCI-X slot, we got the following problem :
When you type "modprobe 3c59x", the system freeze.
Has someone already test this ?
This card works perfectly on the same PCI-X slot with  a non RT kernel.
Do you need some more info ?
