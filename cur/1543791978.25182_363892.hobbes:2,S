Sure.

Although the situation here is really the other way around -
filesystem is mounted readonly (at least in this case with floppies -
but there are probably others too) and wants to go rw. When asked, we
need to check that the media is able to do handle that transition.
Currently I've bodged floppy.c to store this in policy/readonly (which
is what got me looking at genhd last week) but really there should be
a better way - one where we do this once we get to do_remount_sb or
whatever. This seems to be missing functionality.

Ok. So what you're saying is that this is more complex than I'd
implied and you're right :-) But aside from that, you're the expert
and I'm willing to go be a patch monkey, so just tell me what you
think is worth trying...
