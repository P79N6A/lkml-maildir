1. The following program hangs with VECTOR_COUNT set to high values
(greater than 16). It seems that Linux advertises a UIO_MAXIOV that is
large (1024) but it doesn't work for values that high.
Just compile the program and see for yourself. Then reset VECTOR_COUNT
to 16 and it works just fine.

I'm fairly sure this is in the latest kernel as well.
2. Although I do not have a test program for it, I am 100% sure that
even in the latest kernel, I sometimes see PARTIAL ::writev()'s of
data on blocking network connections.
	Given that ::writev() on a blocking socket should never do
that, I suspect something isn't right in the networking code.
	I wish this test program would show that problem,
unfortunately, it doesn't. However, I KNOW for a fact that I have seen
it. Perhaps some kind of signal logic interrupts writev(). I'm unsure.
	In any case, ::writev() does sometimes perform a partial write
on a blocking socket, that is a BUG.
