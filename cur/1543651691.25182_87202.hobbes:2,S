I think the arguments against having different capabilities for the same
executable by different names have been made. It does seem that this would
mean a symbolic link to the enabled directory entry would work and have
capabilities, while a hard link to the inode would not?
Being hard to understand is one source of security errors of the "I didn't
mean to do that" type.

I thought about symlink-like thngs when I was trying to envision an ACL by
group, allowing control of a group other than the non-owner group to have
more (or fewer) rights.

The problem with any form of link by name is that there's no easy way to
tell from the inode how many pointers there are, and from the link to tell
when the link target has changed. I could envision security attacks based
on changing the base file and having capabilities apply via the link.
None of this is beyond implementation, but the idea of having something on
a file inode certainly removes all attacks taking advantage of the link
relationship. The best way to make something secure is to eliminate the
need for it.
