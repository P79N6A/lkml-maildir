Seems it is too coplex model at least for the first step. The one of 
possible trade-offs coming on mind is to trace the number of resources 
(mutexes) held by a process and to restore original priority only when 
resource count reaches 0. This is one of the sollutions accepted by RTOS 
guys.
The other concern with PI is that most likely PI should be prohibited 
for utilization with locks which are used in the way similar to "waiting 
completition" - i.e. if PI is employed on a mutex it is prohibited to 
release it if a process is not the owner of the mutex.

It is definitly non-trivial work to adapt this approach - there are a 
lot of issues.
