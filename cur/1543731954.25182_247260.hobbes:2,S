Just to make sure I've understood this correctly. SGIO takes a number of 
memory locations and fills these with data from a continous stream of 
data from the card? I.e. only the local memory locations need special 
handling. No seeking on the card? And any "gaps" where data is not 
wanted is handled by upper layers?
