Do you know of any adapter actually not supporting the SMBus Quick
command (which we use for probing)?

Coding style please: one space after the comma.

You are duplicating a part of i2c_probe_address() here. Why don't you
simply call it?
This part of the code is very sensible because of the 24RF08 corruption
issue. I have plans to change the probing method, e.g. by using SMBus
Receive Byte instead of SMBus Quick for the 0x50-0x5F address range.
Thus I would really appreciate if this code would not be duplicated.
Thanks,
