Nicke,
Glad to hear you got it working. Check out 
http://acpi.sourceforge.net
 for acpi
related information. If you can get it working with acpi=off and it doesn't when
you don't pass that flag, I'd say that there's at least something fishy
happening with acpi on your machine.
As for getting it running on 2.6 with dm, the only way I know of is to create a
custom initrd file by hand. You have to compile the lvm-dm tools statically and
create mappings first. Then in the linuxrc script, you need run dmsetup and
point it at the config files to create the devices. Until this is handled better
it's not really recommended. Good luck,
-Walt
