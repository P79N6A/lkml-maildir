Thanks for responding.  But I would still like to understand what the
functionality is of the build --> /usr/src/linuc.  Is it dispensable,
once the module tree has been installed? 
Incidentally, per below, my own modutils is current, though some of the
folks using our ltmodem.o compiler/installer kits may indeed need to
update.

# insmod -V
insmod version 2.4.2
# grep " # " /usr/src/linux-2.4.3/Documentation/Changes
o  Gnu C                  2.91.66                 # gcc --version
o  Gnu make               3.77                    # make --version
o  binutils               2.9.1.0.25              # ld -v
o  util-linux             2.10o                   # fdformat --version
o  modutils               2.4.2                   # insmod -V
etc.
