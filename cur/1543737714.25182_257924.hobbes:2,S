Only for things like detach_state and power_state, which shouldn't
be numbers in the first place ... :)
The /sys/module/*/OPTION strings use Y/N for booleans, and
maybe sysfs should actually have generic code to read/write
such boolean values.

That doesn't work too well for things like USB, where one config
may support wakeup but another doesn't ... and unconfigured
devices never support it.  The "can_support" value changes
over time.
