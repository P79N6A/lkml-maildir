Does this mean that the read() call must write sizeof(siginfo_t) bytes
for each signal delivered?
At the moment, the kernel does not have to write the whole siginfo_t
structure to userspace -- it can write just those fields which are
relevant for a particular signal.

sigopen() won't prevent signal usage clashes if the other user is using
sigaction() and sigtimedwait(), or will it?
Btw, this functionality is already available using sigaction().  Just
search for a signal whose handler is SIG_DFL.  If you then block that
signal before changing, checking the result, and unblocking the signal,
you can avoid race conditions too.  (This is what my programs do).
