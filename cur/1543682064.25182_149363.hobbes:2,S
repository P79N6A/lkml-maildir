It seems that by trial and error I figured it out.  There's a i2c-dev module that
I have to load first, then via686a, then i2c-isa.  This order is different than with
lm_sensors under 2.4 kernels.  Also, the i2c-viapro was required before, but
now it doesn't seem to do anything.
Thanks for helping,
