The GPL doesn't require to give back under a licence that gives less 
protection for the code than the GPL does.
If you take the BSD licence seriously you don't request to get anything 
back on moral grounds.
If you take the GPL seriously you don't want your modifications being 
available with less protection.
In reality, where it makes sense technically, it's quite likely that an 
author will make his modifications, or even a completely self-written 
driver, also available under the terms of the BSD licence when asked in 
a friendly way.
