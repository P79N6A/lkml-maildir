Ok, so it's tentatively the IOAPIC disable/enable code.  But it could
obviously be something that just interacts with it, including just a
timing issue (ie the _real_ bug might just be bad behaviour when
changing IO-APIC state at the same time as an interrupt happens, and
disable/enable-irq just happen to be the only things that do it at a
high enough frequency that you can see the problem). 
Remind me: what polarity are your io-apic irq's? Level, edge, sideways?
Anything else that might be relevant?
