 I do exactly the same.

In my case it would corrupt mail that had already been delivered ok into
the mailbox, and later I would look again and the same email that had been
ok would be corrupt. It did corrupt some before I ever saw it as well.

Hmm. It didn't look like it was overwriting one email with parts of
another, it was just the same character over and over.
