Yes, it's perfectly possible for the X server to do that.
The main problem is that the X server shouldn't touch things that are
controlled by a fbdev driver.
It's a bit weird... No one thinks about implementing SCSI or Ethernet drivers
in user space, but for graphics that's all OK. Worse, for graphics it's even
considered normal that the user space driver plays with the hardware behind the
kernel driver's back...

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
