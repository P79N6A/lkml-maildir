The original question was about an in-kernel DHCP client, which exists
in the form of net/ipv4/ipconfig.c.  The vague plan of record is to
remove it from the kernel some time early in the 2.6 era, and replace it
with a userspace ipconfig implementation that runs in initramfs.
Note the complete lack of mention of DHCP servers.
