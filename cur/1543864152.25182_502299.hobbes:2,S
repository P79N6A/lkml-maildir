You are mistaken. The MB here are actual megabytes (million bytes), not MiB.
Read the code, or do the computation: 488397168*512 = 250059350016.
(Precisely what one wants - the kernel gives the correct size,
just like the disk manufacturers, and there is no discrepancy.
Binary abuse for decimal prefixes is a sloppiness that might be
acceptable for stuff that naturally comes in powers of two.
It is long ago that that was true for disks.)
