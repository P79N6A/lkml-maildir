I've written another piece of debugging code for you, this is also to
apply on top of rc3-aa3, but of course not at the same time as the above
one. The above one disables compound compeltely, while the below one is
trying to debug what's going wrong in compound.
Basically I store a backup copy of page->private into page->mapping
(arch is 32bit so they're the same size). we know for sure you're not
going to map into userspace those order >0 pages since hugetlbfs is off,
so reusing mapcount as a backup copy of page->private for compound pages
should be ok.
this way when we get the screwed page->private we see what's going on,
and if page->mapping is still pointing to 'page'. If page->mapping ==
page at least we know it's only page->private being corrupt. I don't
really see how can ppc32 corrupt page->private though.
