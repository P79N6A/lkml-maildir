I can see from kernel/exit.c where the message "Attempted to kill init"
comes from in the kernel. That is good. What would be helpful is to
deteremine where in the code the function do_exit() is called. Is there
a way to do that? I am trying to hunt down a boot failure for a kernel
on a Gentoo LiveCD. I am in communication with the developers of the
Gentoo Alpha list about this problem?
