Just out of curiosity I tried S3 Sonic Vibes sound card, which has
only 24 address lines connected, on sx164. This revealed two bugs
in the pci code:
 - dma mask 0x00ffffff (24 bits) exactly fits the ISA scatter-gather
   window, but was rejected by pci_dma_supported() due to off-by-one bug.
 - this card has some non-standard set of I/O ports, and driver tries to
   allocate resource for it at the runtime.  At this time
   pcibios_update_resource() already has been vanished.
With these fixes the card started to work to the best of its ability,
i.e. screechy and noisy, so after being so helpful the poor thing went
back into the rubbish bin...
Ivan.
