Looking at your trace I noticed that ftp.porcupine.org echo the tsval of
the syn in the syn-ack, while linux doesn't. But the timestamp in the syn
and synack should be needed only to initialize paws to avoid wrapped
sequence number, so I think linux is doing a more efficient choice without
echoing the tp->tsrecent in the synack packet. I am not 100% sure though
because I never seen rfc1323.txt before today (and I am not uptodate with
latest tcp-impl-drafts).
