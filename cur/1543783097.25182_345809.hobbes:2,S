I think a bs of 4k is way too small and will cause huge CPU overhead.
Can you try with something like 4M? Also, you can use /dev/full to avoid
the pre-zeroing.

You're saturating some bus. It almost looks like it's the PCI-X,
although that should be able to deliver up (if running at the full speed
of AMD8132) up to 1GB/sec, so it SHOULD not be an issue.

No, I don't think this is OK.

You need to find where the bottleneck is, by removing one possible
bottleneck at a time in your test.
