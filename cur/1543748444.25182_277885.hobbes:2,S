Ingo,
I see something similar here also:
running realfeel with rtc histogram generates > 100 usec entries in the 
histogram but none of these are ever caught by the wakeup tracing.
IRQ 8 = 99
realfeel = 98
IRQ 0 = 97
-realfeel sets rtc up to 1024 Hz and does blocking read on rtc
-IRQ 8 hits and rtc_interrupt runs code from rtc_wake_event which sets 
last_interrupt_time then calls wake_up_interruptible which as you know 
eventually calls try_to_wake_up because it's the default_wake_function
-the blocked read then restarts after the schedule() call in rtc_read, 
right?
-then realfeel in rtc_read runs code in rtc_read_event which sets now, 
then generates histogram entry from the diff between now and 
last_interrupt_time
No wakeup latency generated from this.
I think I know why we don't get traces from this. TIF_NEED_RESCHED is 
not set for IRQ 8 at the time that it wakes up realfeel so _need_resched 
fails and trace_start_sched_wakeup doesn't actually call 
__trace_start_sched_wakeup(p)???
