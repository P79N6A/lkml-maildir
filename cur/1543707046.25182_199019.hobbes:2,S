Some patches are referenced at the following link for the xfree86 CVS:

These patches do two things.  One allows X to use IGP drivers with DRI.  The
other generates a .ko for Linux 2.6 that works with the Radeon IGP cards.
It is the responsibility of the XFree86 project to merge in the DRI patch;
however, the new IGP-compatible Radeon driver
( 
http://www.cliff.biffle.org/patches/radeon_igp-2.6.patch
 )
is a kernel driver.  Has this been moved into the Linux source tree yet?  If
not, could someone move it into the tree?  Better to have it now than to wait
for X 4.4 to come out and (possibly) have the DRI patch merged in before
scrambling to get a working driver.
