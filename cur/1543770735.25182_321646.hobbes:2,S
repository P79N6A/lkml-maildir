It discovered the disks had failed because they had outstanding I/O that
failed to complete and errorred. At that point your stripes *are*
inconsistent. If it didn't mark them as failed then you wouldn't know it
was corrupted after a power restore. You can then clean it fsck it,
restore it, use mdadm as appropriate to restore the volume and check it.

It only takes on disk in an array to short 12v and 5v due to a component
failure to total the entire disk array, and with both IDE and SCSI a
drive fail can hang the entire bus anyway.
