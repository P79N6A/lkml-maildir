Well, any cache is dropped when the device is closed. "dd" closes the device
when it finishes.
Try a program that reads the same two blocks (spaced videly apart)
over and over from the same open file descriptor.  With _no_ caching 
you'll see
the drive seeking all the time.  With caching, you won't.
