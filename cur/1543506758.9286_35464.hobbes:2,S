HI ya all,
I heard from an other list that there was a discussion here a few weeks
ago or some, about this topic.
I need a prg wich will help me in rebuilding/recreating my partition
table.
I had 2 partitions on it.
One ext2 and one swap.
Unfortunatly I don't recall in which order.
The data is still there, only the table was lost due to a mistake I made
while installing RH6.0.
I have multiple drives and I installed on one but the other lost its
table, so...
Thanks to anyone who can help me out here!
I am on this list so no need for personal CC's, though they are always
welcome when answering one-of my questions, no SPAM ofcourse. ;-)
TTYL.
