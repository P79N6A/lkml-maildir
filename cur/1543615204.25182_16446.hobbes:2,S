The up to date mesh driver didn't get into 2.4.18pre1, either I forgot
to send it to Marcelo along with the other PPC patches, or he missed it.
I'll take care of this.
The other patch for getting rid of "target 0 aborted" need some more
review. You seem to just remove the bus reset. That could be made a
driver option in case it really cause trouble, but I suppose the bug
is elsewhere (while beeing triggered by the bus reset).
I'll look into this around next week.
Ben.
