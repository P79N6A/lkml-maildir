A few. Please address them and resubmit with full changelog and
proper attribution (if possible) and a signed-of-by.

I would strongly prefer the name "build-pkg".
The prefix -pkg is just to use the magic in top-level Makefile to
dicert it to the right Makefile.

I would like to attribute whoever made this somehow.
Dave - do you know?

This becomes obsolete when target is named -pkg

Here we could do a $(MAKE) KBUILD_SRC= clean
This will leave all files needed for building external modules
but delete the rest (almost).

This chunk needs to be updated to the new install target.

set -e to bail out on error could do it for now.

kbuild will not like it either so you can drop this FIXME

Could we pass this as parameters. This makes it explicit.
You do not need to check them since this script is not
supposed to be used stand-alone.

                                                                                               ^
Why this wildcard??? (objtree/>*<Makefile)
Seems to be a typing error.

Remove this line since it is commented out

If we do the make clean this is not needed.

Something less hardcoded are preferred. Maybe like:
cp -a `ls | grep -v ^asm` asm-generic $(tgtdir}/include
> +cp -a ${objtree}/include/config ${objtree}/include/asm ${tgtdir}/include
> +cp -a $(readlink ${objtree}/include/asm) ${tgtdir}/include
Here we use readlink but in next line we use $ARCH.
We should be consitent and use ARCH all over.

Too hardcoded.
Here we could use some sed magic to extract a potential ALTARCH from asm-${ARCH}/Kbuild
My sed skills are too limited to do this in a minute... :-(

This part I did not check up on - I assume it is correct.
