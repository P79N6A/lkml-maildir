Yes.  But there are some restricts with write_acpi_int that only
takes single integer parameter, and write_acpi_int2 that fits aml
method of taking Package as argument.

Yes. poll_method is for query the status/current value.
For example, to query current brightness value.

I think this is ok.

Yes.  You are right.

Thanks for doing that.
