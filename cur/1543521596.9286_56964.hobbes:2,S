Ok, i don't recollect the exact line number printed for the BUG line, but
I've seen this on two machines now.  Kernels 2.3.35 through 39.
Both machines ended up dying in heaving convulsions.  Unfortunately the
death of the machine is by multiple OOPS faults and scroll back is blasted. 
I have one machine stabilised on 2.3.36, the other is running 38.  Other
close kernel versions are unreliable.
Anyone else seen this?
