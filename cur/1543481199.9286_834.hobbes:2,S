Hello,
I'm experiencing strange behaviour when using the new kernel.  When I
use 2.0.36, eth0 is my PCI tulip card and eth1 is my PCI ne2k compatible
card.  However, when I use the 2.2.0-pre8, eth0 becomes the ne2k and
eth1 the tulip card.  In both kernels, I've compiled the drivers into
the kernel and append them in my lilo.conf file with the line:
 append="ether=11,0xef40,eth0 ether=10,0xe880,eth1"
I should mention that I enabled PnP in the new kernel.  Would this be
the culprit for this strange error?
Cheers, Luc.
