Yep, sorry.  The IDE controller must tri-state off an entire cable...
both devices.  I guess you could have 2 devices, and swap one but leave
the other, you just have to halt all IO durring the swap, perhaps reset
both devices when the cable is switched back on.
Interesting to note, Intel's PIIX (forget what version) had a feature
that would split the primary cable (from the OS point of view - think
dos here) so the master was on the primary cable, and the slave was on
the secondary cable.  each device (ie swap bay in a laptop) could be
tristated separately.  of course you loose the secondary channel.
