you're describing the deadlock here: all memory is full, no process 
which allocates memory can make any progress. This is not a true oom 
situation: there can be plenty of memory in dirty pagecache which we 
could reclaim if we had that tiny bit of reserve memory.

Right. But ramfs doesn't call a userspace process which calls the kernel 
right back.

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
