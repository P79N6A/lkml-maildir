I mentioned it in some other answer...I think. Nevermind. One of the fusyn
layers (ufuqueue) can emulate futexes completely [except for a few extra 
errno codes and the scheduling policy based wakeup and the missing requeue
[easy to do] and FUTEX_FD -- only NGPT uses it, afaik]. 
The interface is now through a three system calls (sys_ufuqueue_{wait,wake,ctl}), 
but it should be easy to redirect sys_futex().

That makes sense. Performance overhead wise would be related only to the
extra spinlocks we take...I'll work on that redirection layer--I am going
on vacation tonight, but it should be ready in a couple of days as soon
as I come back.
