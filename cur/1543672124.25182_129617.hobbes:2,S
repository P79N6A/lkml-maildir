Hi
I have a 3Com 3c940 gigabit LOM, that is basically a
SysKonnect chipset card.  Here are later drivers that
do support it:
  
ftp://ftp.asus.com.tw/pub/ASUS/lan/3com/3c940/041_Linux.zip
The current one in the 2.5 tree was last updated for newer
chipsets in 2001, while the new was updated February this
year.
Anyhow, I got the new to compile, and fixed the few irqreturn_t
calls, and some other 2.5 changes I knew about.
Now the problem is that if I try to load it, I get this:
-----------------------------------------
sk98lin: Unknown symbol __udivdi3
-----------------------------------------
Meaning it linked with libgcc_s.so.  Any ideas why ?
If you need the diff from above source, let me know.  Else
if somebody more experienced is interested in porting it,
I will gladly test.
Thanks,
