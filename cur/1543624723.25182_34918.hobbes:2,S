Subject: null pointer error in raw device I/O from kernel threads

Hi, I am trying to do I/O to raw devices from within
kernel threads.  I got null pointer error because the
raw device code references current->mm, but for kernel
threads, current->mm is 0 (NULL).  I tried to force it
to use current->active_mm but the I/O operation
returns EFAULT (-14).  
Any advice on how to make raw device I/O work from
kernel threads is appreciated.
