And a good hunch.  There is NO fundamental difference between
used-once vs. used-twice or used-twice vs. used-thrice.  It's
one big gray area of pages further or closer to eviction.
The solution to making a system which is resistant to scanning,
yet allows the streaming IO to evict the least used part of the
currently active pages (to replace old data) is to use a better
page aging tactic.
If you don't believe me, try streaming IO on Linux 2.0 for a
try, or grab my patch to introduce tunable page aging on
2.4.8-ac7+ and try it. ;)

Rik
