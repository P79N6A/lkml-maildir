Hi there.
I can't help with the rest of this, and what follows herein may not be
relevant, but...
 > I am using RedHat 5.2 with kernel 2.0.36.
Is that the one that came with RedHat 5.2 (2.0.36-0.7), or one of the
update RPM's (2.0.36-1 or 2.0.36-3), or did you compile a custom
kernel from the raw tarballs?
Note that kernel-2.0.36-0.7.i386.rpm relates to the 2.0.36-pre7
kernel, and NOT the final release. Both kernel-2.0.36-1.i386.rpm and
kernel-2.0.36-3.i386.rpm relate to the final release though...
Best wishes from Riley.
