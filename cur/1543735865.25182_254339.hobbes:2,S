Aha, this is an interesting point (which was missing from your previous
explanation). The base of your proposal would be to have several small i2c
"trees" (where a tree is a list of adapters and a list of clients) instead of
a larger, unique one. This would indeed solve a number of problems, and I
admit that it is somehow equivalent to Michael's classes in that it
efficiently prevents the hardware monitoring clients from probing the video
stuff. The rest is just details internal to each "tree". As I understand it,
each video device would be a tree on itself, while the whole hardware
monitoring stuff would constitute one (bigger) tree. Correct?

With your proposal, these drivers could use the common code again while still
being completely separated from the other i2c busses, right?
Thanks.
