Does the C3 do any kind of frequency shifting?
For example, on a transmeta CPU, the TSC will run at a constant
"nominal" speed (the highest the CPU can go), although the real CPU
speed will depend on the load of the machine and temperature etc.  So on
a crusoe CPU you'll see varying speeds (and it depends on the speed
grade, because that in turn depends on how many longrun steps are being
actively used). 
For example, on a mostly idle machine I get
	torvalds@kiwi:~ > ./a.out 
	nothing: 54 cycles
	locked add: 54 cycles
	cpuid: 91 cycles
while if I have another window that does an endless loop to keep the CPU
busy, the _real_ frequency of the CPU scales up, and the machine
basically becomes faster:
	torvalds@kiwi:~ > ./a.out 
	nothing: 36 cycles
	locked add: 36 cycles
	cpuid: 54 cycles
(The reason why the "nothing" TSC read is expensive on crusoe is because
of the scaling of the TSC - rdtsc literally has to do a floating point
multiply-add to scale the clock to the right "nominal" frequency.  Of
course, "expensive" is still a lot less than the inexplicable 80 cycles
on a P4). 
(That's a 600MHz part going down to to 400MHz in idle, btw)
On a 633MHz part (I don't actually have access to any of the high speed
grades ;) it ends up being 
fast:
	nothing: 39 cycles
	locked add: 40 cycles
	cpuid: 68 cycles
slow: 
	nothing: 82 cycles
	locked add: 84 cycles
	cpuid: 122 cycles
which corresponds to a 633MHz part going down to 300MHz in idle.
And of course, you can get pretty much anything in between, depending on
what the load is...
