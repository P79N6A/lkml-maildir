Yes, that change would make MS_ASYNC asynchronously start as much
IO as possible, as soon as possible. Which is good for the problem
reporter, who uses it to pipeline IOs and seems to have fairly good
control of when IO starts and finishes.
I don't think anyone would use MS_ASYNC for anything other than
performance improvement, so it is not like we need super well
defined behaviour... the earlier it will start IO AFAIKS the better.

I don't think there is any downside to changing MS_ASYNC either,
though.
