When setting foreground and log writer to rt-prio, the log latency reduced to 4.8ms. Performance is about 1.5% higher than the CFS result.
On a side note, we had been using rt-prio on all DBMS processes and log writer ( in higher priority) for the best OLTP performance. That has worked pretty well until 2.6.25 when the new rt scheduler introduced the pull/push task for lower scheduling latency for rt-task. That has negative impact on this workload, probably due to the more elaborated load calculation/balancing for hundred of foreground rt-prio processes. Also, there is that question of no production environment would run DBMS with rt-prio. That is why I am going back to explore CFS and see whether I can drop rt-prio for good.
