The validity or otherwise of pathname access control is not being 
discussed here.
The point is that the pathname model does not generalize, and that 
AppArmor's inability to provide adequate coverage of the system is a 
design issue arising from this.
Recall that the question asked by Lars was whether there were any 
outstanding technical issues relating to AppArmor.
AppArmor does not and can not provide the level of confinement claimed by 
the documentation, and its policy does not reflect its actual confinement 
properties.  That's kind of a technical issue, right?
