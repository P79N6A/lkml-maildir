The same problem occurred to me at the beginning of the 2.2.x (albeit
slightly patched) kernels. The cause of the problem was that the huffman
code lookup table grew too much with some byte patterns in the kernel
image. Minimal changes in kernel source code made the problem disappear.
I talked to the author of zlib about this and he suggested to raise the
HEAP_SIZE, too. Debugging showed that the HEAP_SIZE was only some bytes
too small in my case.
I second this to raise the heap size a bit (IMHO 0x2400 should be enough).
