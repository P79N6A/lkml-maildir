Dear All,
I have a small doubt about the GPL and NON GPL version modules.
If I have a module called module A which uses the GPL code and module B
uses the NON GPL (proprietary) code. If the module A depends on module
B, is it possible to load these modules?
Will it be violating any GPL Rules?
Regards,
Srinivas G
