Sorry, I don't undestand why ???
You can use 32bit filesystem too, but you limit the size of the logical volume
to be compatible with the filesystem you use. LVM allows to create several 32bit
volumes on a big (> 8T) disk (if exists)
But if we think further, as biggest disk is 750 GB (and I think even using HW
RAID, there is an HW limit something like 4 TB), we can imagine a big Volume
Group belonging several Physical Volumes divided in Logical Volumes: so we
already use LVM, we don't need partition...)

LVM is more than a partition manager:
- it is arch-independent
- it is 64bit compliant
- it can gather together several disks
- it is flexible (you can add/remove/resize volume)
- it is modern (doesn't have primary/extended partition, doesn't have limited
number of partition)
so... it's a volume manager.

Laurent
