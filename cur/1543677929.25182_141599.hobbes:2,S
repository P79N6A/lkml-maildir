The userspace support tools need to be able to handle gaps
in any case, because call_usermodehelper() may fail.
(In practice it won't fail, because the memory allocator is immortal.
But the capability should be there.
(Well actually, it could fail because the VM overcommit code might
refuse the mmap.
(But probably not, because root gets an extra margin.)))
