I have a tower case and cannot restore textmode as well.
"savetextmode" is not sufficient for my ATI Mach64 and X sucks several times:
1.) only the kernel should control hardware devices
    this is now beeing fixed with GGI
2.) the current textmode is only saved in memory when X starts
    seems the makers of XFree86 didn't expect their servers to crash...
3.) the X server would be able to set the hardware to a sane default textmode
    again the developers didn't expect it to crash and omitted this functionality

This happens as soon as there is no more memory available. But you may want to use ulimit to let it happen before.
