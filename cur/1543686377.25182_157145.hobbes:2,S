For those Thinkpads a DMI blacklist entry should suffice.
(Just like it solved the Inspiron problems.)
2.6-mm has the "lapic" and "nolapic" options I added so that
P4s no longer are autoenabled, needed for broken ACPI BIOSen.
Perhaps we should require the "lapic" option also for all P6s?
(Strangely, K7 machines seem to have fewer local APIC BIOS issues
than either P6 or P4 machines.)
