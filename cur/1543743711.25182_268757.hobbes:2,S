Not exactly. I end up creating really big, growing, file on no limit RAM 
backed filesystem. EVMS locks standard devices, so I probably can not run 
something like:
dd if=/dev/sda5 of=/dev/sda6 bs=1024
because it will return "device busy" error or something like that. But I 
didn't test it. But I tested (in the most painful way) that
mount -t ext2 /dev/sda5 /mnt/foo
will not work because of this error.
And EVMS has no major numbers. It is purely user space. It uses 
device-mapper for creating devices and uses device-mapper's major number.
And yes, I probably can force UDEV to stop creating /dev/sda[0-9]* 
devices, but this is not the right solution I think. These config files 
are managed by my distribution and are complicated. I do not want to have 
to merge them with updates every time new UDEV is released. Besides I want 
to disable kernel partition discovery just for this device. This will be 
ugly excaption.
