So this:
	/*
	 * Be lazy and only check for valid flags here,  keeping it out of the
	 * critical path in kmem_cache_alloc().
	 */
	BUG_ON(flags & ~(GFP_DMA | __GFP_ZERO | GFP_LEVEL_MASK));
would no longer need the __GFP_ZERO.  Ditto in slob's new_slab().

Well.  I didn't memorise the past few months' 250-odd slab/slob/slub
patches..
My point is, I don't think we want some code doing
kmalloc(42, GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_ZERO) and some other code doing
kzalloc(42, GFP_KERNEL).  But this patch does nothing to increase the
chances of that happening, so I'm happy.
