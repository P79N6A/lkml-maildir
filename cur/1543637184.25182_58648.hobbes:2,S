I am currently running 2.4.18 from SuSE without any (major) 
problems. I found it here:
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/sf/axp/7.1/RPMS/kernel-source-
2.4.18.SuSE-0.alpha.rpm.
Then I took arch/alpha/kernel/core_cia.c from version 2.4.12
(the current version does not run on XLT's booting with MILO;
the latest one is 2.4.12).

Hopefully I can fix core_cia.c to run on XLT's (it's hard to find any 
documentation on this toppic) and arch/alpha/kernel/setup.c for 
machines booting with linload.exe/MILO because the hwrpb
struct is built by MILO and does not match the one booting from
SRM (eg. empty percpu struct resulting in a cpucount of zero
in /proc/cpuinfo).

Martin
