If you are having trouble with a Red Hat system and did not buy it, you
can still usually get some Red Hat specific help by joining the
appropriate mailing list. In the case of Red Hat 6.2 (Zoot) you can join
zoot-list@redhat.com. Send a message to zoot-list-request@redhat.com
with no subject and a body containing jut the word 'subscribe'.
In answer to your question, boot your system with the following at the
lilo prompt:
LILO: linux x86_serial_nr=1
This will avoid the Oops caused when the code intended to disable a
Pentium III serial number attempts to run on the newer Athlon
(Thunderbird or Duron). You can then upgrade to kernel-2.2.16-3 from Red
Hat's errata, or roll your own kernel. In any event you don't want to
use the stock 2.2.14-5.0 under any circumstances (very buggy).
