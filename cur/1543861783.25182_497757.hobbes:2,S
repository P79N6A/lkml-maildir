  Yes, making fs readonly at VFS level would not work for already opened
files. But you if you create new union, you could lock down the
filesystems you are unioning (via s_umount semaphore), go through lists
of all open fd's on those filesystems and check whether they are open
for write or not. If some fd is open for writing, you simply fail to
create the union (and it's upto user to solve the problem). Otherwise
you mark filesystems as RO and safely proceed with creating the union.
I guess you must have come up with this solution. So what is the problem
with it?
