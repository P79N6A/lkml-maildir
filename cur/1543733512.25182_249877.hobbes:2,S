What tree would you like me to base the patch on?  In absence of response,
it will be the latest -mm.

Yes, from your mail:

I'm not sure I follow.  Which lock are you concerned about deadlocking on?
From an earlier message, you say this:

So I think it's worth addressing in netpoll, as opposed to every driver.
