It works for me on kernel 2.2.12 with modutils 2.1.121.  Since kernel
2.1.91, rmmod just issues syscall delete_module(NULL) and the kernel
does all the work.  There are a couple of things to watch out for, both
from the kernel code.
It will not automatically delete an autoclean module unless the module
has been used at least once.  So the sequence insmod -k, rmmod -a
without using the module will not delete it.
Even after using a module, the first rmmod -a does nothing.  The second
one gets rid of the autoclean modules that have been used.
