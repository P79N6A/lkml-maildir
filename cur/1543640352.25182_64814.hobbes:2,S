they also come with RNGs.
A question: what is the denger of the network entropy? is it, that one is a
fraid that snooping could gather knowledge about random source, or is it
more along the line that one fears that specially deviced packages can feed
manufactured, and therefore not randmom bits?
In the first case, how big would be the hardware proccessing variance for an
interrupt be? Is it realy predictable from sniffing the network how that
will result in interrupts?
How can softinterrupts help here?
Greetings
Bernd
