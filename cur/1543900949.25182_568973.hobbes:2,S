Thomas,
> we are pleased to announce the v2.6.22.1-rt3 kernel
Thanks a lot!
Using the .config file from the previous stable version (2.6.21.6-rt21), 
the new version runs okay on an x86_64 system. On an i386 system, 
however, the system is crashing at an early boot stage displaying an 
INT13 reg dump at the window bottom.
After disabling paravirtualization support (CONFIG_PARAVIRT), the new 
version is working fine on i386 as well.
Just in case someone out there is experiencing the same problem.
