It slows down the resume on my box way too much.  Last time it took 10x more
time than actually reading the image.
I think the problem is for the userland suspend (which I use) it's done too early,
when the image pages are still in the swap, so they are taken into consideration
by the aggressive prefetch.  If that really is the case, the solution would be to
trigger the aggressive prefetch from the userland, if needed, after the image
pages have been released.
Greetings,
Rafael
