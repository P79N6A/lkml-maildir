Well, what swsusp does is not really a suspend operation.  It is, roughly, a
"save the contents of memory and power off" thing.  During the "resume" we do
something like "restore the contents of memory and use it as the initial
data", but the state of devices (ie. hardware) is not expected to be saved.
Moreover, I'm starting to think that it's actually wrong to assume that the
hardware state will be saved and the drivers that make such an assumption
need fixing.
