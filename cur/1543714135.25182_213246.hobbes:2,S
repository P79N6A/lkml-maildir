Yes, definitely closer to my way of thinking ...
It seems unintuitive that you have to read the file for the method to
take effect.  How about having the write function invoke the method and
(if there is a result) store it for later read-back via the read function?
It should be discarded on close, of course.  A read() on a file with
no stored result should invoke the ACPI method (on the assumption this
is a parameter-less method) and return the result directly.  Closing a
file should discard any result from the method.

himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
