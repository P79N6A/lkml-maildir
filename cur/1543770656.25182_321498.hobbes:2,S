Hello,
here on my Mainboard ASUS P5WAD2-Premium (i955X/ICH7) I need to enable
AHCI support
like on the ICH6R based ASUS P5AD2-E xx the same here.
What I have noticed is when I enable Intel Raid support AHCI is on by
default, maybe it used AHCI if
drive is capable?! There are also performance regressions from within
used bios.
What mainboard are you using Erik? All mainboards with ICH6R I saw and
had (925X,925XE) offer options to enable AHCI.
Greets and best regards
    Michael
