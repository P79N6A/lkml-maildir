Well I just got it and installed it. It has the same problem. klogd
runs fine. Syslogd segfaults as soon as it forks. Attempts to debug
it fail, even with `-d` because where ever it segfaults is not in
either its space of the C runtime library space. If I compile it
with TESTING enabled, it runs fine, getting its input from stdin.
However, it can't be used in this manner.

It crashes near one of these 'btl` there are only two in the program.
I'll be damned if I can find out what this macro is or where it is
defined.
