Err, no.  Software, per legal definitions in Brazil, US and elsewhere,
require some physical support.  That's the hard disk in the TiVO DVR,
in this case.  I don't see how this matters, though.

Per this reasoning, nobody never modifies software.  When you open a
source file in your editor, you make changes to it, then save it,
you're not modifying it, you're replacing it with another copy, and
the only thing that actually got modified was the hardware.
Maybe look what "modify" means in legal context?
Then refer to the GPL:
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program,

Agreed.  But as it turns out they use these checks to stop people from
modifying the copy of Linux they ship in the device, and this
restriction is a GPL violation because they don't provide information
you need to build a functioning modified version.

You don't retain that right yourself.  When you pass that copy on, you
pass it on with all the rights that you have.  No problem here.  This
is no different from the software on ROM.

If you choose to disregard the legal meaning of the legal terms used
in the GPLv2, you may have a point.

Yes.  That's all I'm saying.  You just can't use the hardware to take
that control away.  That would be a violation of the license.

This is not true.
The spirit remains the same: let people modify and share the software.
If the binary you got can't be created out of the corresponding
sources, something is missing.  If it won't run without this missing
bit, you're missing functional portions of the source code.  This all
means the hardware is being used to impose a restriction on
modification of the software, which is against the spirit of the GPL,
and quite likely against its letter as well.
If you don't want it to be so, you can always add an additional
permission that clarifies this bit, such that TiVO and you will be
happy.
