I haven't looked into the exact details, but I guess you're referring to
the fact that fxsave only saves the "empty" bit. 
That's not lossy: the rest of the tag information is implicit in the
actual value of the stack entry.
It shoul dbe really easy to convert between the new and the old format:
let the hardware do it for you:
	fxrestore new-format
	fnsave old-format
I don't see any loss of information anywhere..  Am I overlooking
something?
