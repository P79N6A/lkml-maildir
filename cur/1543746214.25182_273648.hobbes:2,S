How would you know what's connected to a serial port?  There's
absolutely no way to tell whether it's a modem or something else, at
least no way that should be attempted inside the kernel.  Manually
checking if there's a modem can be as simple as sending some harmless
AT commands, and check for reasonable replies.  The problem is that
nobody knows what these commands might do to some other device.
