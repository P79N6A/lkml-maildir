Hi,
I am using softdog in my application. One of the problems I am facing is,
when the system comes up after the reboot forced by softdog, file system gets
corrupted and fsck has to check. Some times fsck fails to force check the file
system and
the system enters in to run level 1, leading to manual intervention.
Any idea how to unmount the file system before the system is rebooted by
softdog, so
that system always comes up properly without manual intervention.
Thanks
-Girish
