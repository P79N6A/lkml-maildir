Interesting, I did not know about this paper. A lot of what my patch
does is identical to what they describe, I stop at the OS level though
and haven't (and don't really want to) extend it to applications. I
think that we can get 'pretty good' power saves without going that extra
mile.
Note that I also operate outside of the 4 ide power states described,
sleep -> standby -> idle -> active. I chose to disregard sleep, because
it requires a reset and drive program when transitioning from sleep to
idle. It's my feeling that most drives do the idle -> active transition
(and vice versa) on their own. So for me, that just leaves on
interesting operating mode (idle-active :). However, I added the
acoustic management in-between that. So when the drive is considered
'active' (ie serving requests), the amount of io will determine how fast
the seeks go by switching between the acoustic levels.
So with my patch, we are pretty close to the ECU level described in the
paper. With the laptop patch, we handle the writeout of dirty data at
appropriate times (when reads spin up the disk, etc) as well.

I bundle writes with reads (slighly postponed), doing more would require
the added new syscalls.

Yeah, using aio would make it a lot easier and wouldn't require many
changes to the existing aio interface.

What's stopping you?
