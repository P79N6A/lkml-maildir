Although it is occasionally OK to duplicate a driver, I do not see a 
compelling case with ip100a.
The stronger case for a single codebase is won on the strengths of lower 
long-term maintenance costs, increased strength of review, doesn't break 
existing sundance driver uses, and re-use of existing testing benefits.
If you feel strongly about not showing "sundance" to your users, you can 
always submit a one-line MODULE_ALIAS() change which permits users to 
load "ip100a" (really sundance.c).  Using MODULE_ALIAS() seems quite 
reasonable, given that IC Plus appears to be taking the lead in future 
Sundance-like chip development.
So, please resubmit as changes to the existing sundance.c.  This is 
better for the standard Linux kernel engineering process.
Thanks,
	Jeff
