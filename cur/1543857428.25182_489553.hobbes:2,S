Hi,
One of our server crashed tonight.
Since it has been working flawlessy in the past, i'm wondering why.
Here are the specs
Dual Xeon
8GB Memory
2 Software Raid 6 Arrays
Kernel is 2.6.18 with vserver patch
If someone could please tell me where the error is likely to come from
it would be great.
Hardcopy of the crash is available at:

Thanks
Laurent
