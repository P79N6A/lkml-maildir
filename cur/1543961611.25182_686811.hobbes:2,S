Yes. That is the basic question.  Not all X drivers need it and
potentially the current kernel drm modules can use the
PAT infrastructure that has been merged.
Further a SMM monitor running 100 times or more slower may cause
problems if SMM mode is entered frequently, slowing down the entire
system not just X.
So if you don't have X or you have a crazy SMM monitor this can
be an issue.
