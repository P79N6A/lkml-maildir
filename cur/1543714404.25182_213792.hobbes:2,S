Block allocations happen after ext3_release_file()  ? In that case,
we would have dropped all our reservations at the time of last file close.
But if allocations happen later, the current code will start new reservation
window and start allocations from there.

Come to think of it, the current code has pretty bad search algorithm. We need
to fix that. We hold the spinlock for entire search, thats why our CPU 
utilization is pretty high.
