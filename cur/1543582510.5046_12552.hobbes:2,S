Er, say that again?  Right now, for bootp if you specify "sa=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"
Linux uses that as the host for the NFS server (which does have the side
effect of if TFTP server != NFS server, you don't boot).  Are you saying
your patch takes "rp=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:/foo/root" ?  Just curious, since I
don't know, whats the RFC say about this?
