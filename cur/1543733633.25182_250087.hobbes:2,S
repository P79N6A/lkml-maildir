Please  read again  what I  just  said. I'm  against implementing  it,
because it is creeping featurism.  On the contrary, I said that people
might  actually change  to a  less complicated/bloated  OS  (Whereas I
would choose NetBSD over FreeBSD, but that's another story).
So you say the wrong things at the wrong people.
