Is there a good way to mirror Root disks.
Is RAID-1 only options for mirroring under Linux or something else is avialable.
If RAID-1 is the only option, how safe, fault tolerant it is.
I fear setting up RAID for root, as any problem with RAID may make system unbootable. Any
comments. suggestions links on Root disks mirroing ????
