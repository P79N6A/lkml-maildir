Of course you forget the minor detail that bash 2.0 is mostly incompatible

You don't build kernels on an embedded box. You might well want to avoid
the tools (and yes if you hack off the uclinux/elks libc stuff and elks
apps you can get something that is unix shell environment and passably
convenient in about 700K, including libs).
With nanogui you can get the GUI layer in another 120K, and from numbers
for an initial port of opera to nanogui you can add another 700K to that
pile to get a full web browsing environment.
But you still don't want to compile kernels on it...
