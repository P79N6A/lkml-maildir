During the kernel summit, some discussion was had about the support
requirements for a userspace program loader that loads executables
into hugetlb on behalf of a major application (Oracle). In order to
support this in a robust fashion, the cleanup of the hugetlb must be
robust in the presence of disorderly termination of the programs
(e.g. kill -9). Hence, the cleanup semantics are those of System V
shared memory, but Linux' System V shared memory needs one critical
extension for this use: executability.
The following microscopic patch enables this major application to
provide robust hugetlb cleanup.
