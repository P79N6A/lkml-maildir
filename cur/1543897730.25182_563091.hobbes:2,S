You keep saying that.   But for that to be true you'd have to believe
_everyone_ using Novell distributions has needs that align exactly
with AppArmor.  Otherwise, how to explain that you don't offer and
support both SELinux and AppArmor to your users?
It seems as far as Novell is concerned, AppArmor _is_ meant to replace
SELinux.  Not that there is really anything wrong with that, but it's
a little disingenuous to then argue that they're meant to coexist.
