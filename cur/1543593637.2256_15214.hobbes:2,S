Fill the active list of cache and wait for a while to get the inactive
list full.
When that happens and pressure begins, refill_inactive_scan() from
try_to_free_pages() will not be called because the inactive list is full
(the kernel "thinks" we dont have an inactive shortage). Well, not sure if
this is a bad thing in the end.
