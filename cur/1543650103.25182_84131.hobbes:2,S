The current timestamps on 32bit systems are 32bit. 64bit nanoseconds
would take the same room as 32bit second + 32bit nanosecond. And it would
be incompatible with current glibc (which the additional nanosecond
fields are perfectly compatible - they are zeroed currently). Also glibc
would need to convert it to a timespec for Solaris compatbility anyways
and need an unnecessary division for that.
The same thing applies to file system storage. Storing in nanoseconds
(like e.g. NTFS or CIFS do - they store 64bit in 100ns units since 1601) 
would require slow divisions to convert from the user visible format,
needs the same space and has no advantage as far as I can see.
