Thanks, John.
Henry, nice to meet you.
Panakaj, nice to cross paths with you again.
Andrea Arcangeli, one of the key kernel developers,
asked me to pass on a request:
"If you are going to do bench I would like if you would bench also the
patch below.
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/andrea/kernel-patches/2.2.9_andrea-perf1.gz"
Have you guys read
  
http://www.kegel.com/mindcraft_redux.html
lately?  I update it constantly, and believe it accurately 
summarizes the state of the Linux community with respect 
to Apache performance.  Do take a look, at least at the section 
  
http://www.kegel.com/mindcraft_redux.html#tips
I think it's a good resource for benchmarkers.
Is there any info online about the schedule for and 
participants in the June 14th Apache/Linux benchmark
you're hosting for Mindcraft
(
http://www.mindcraft.com/openbenchmark.html
)?  
If so, I'd like to link to it.
Finally, Juergen Schmidt's recent tests for c't magazin were
rendered partially invalid because he neglected to
configure Apache to block in accept() as required for
maximal Linux performance.  He was informed by several 
people of the error as soon as he posted his config 
files, but by then it was too late.
I'd like to prevent similar problems in the upcoming tests.  
Can you put your proposed configuration files on a web page
and post the URL to linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu before the test?
That way, remote experts can eyeball them for trouble.
Looking forward to your reply.
