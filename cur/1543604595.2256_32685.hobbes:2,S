Subject: (memory?) bug between 2.4.9-ac10 and -ac14

Hello All!
A bug report which seems related to at least memory management:
If becoming root and then su:ing some other, non-local, userid, an oops
with segfault is the outcome. Non-local here means that the user info is
located on another machine, our server. su:ing the dummy local user
seems to work OK.
I remember the new shell being the process that oopses, but can't
unfortunately get the output (other than "segmentation fault") before
Monday as the machine is behind locked doors :-/
Anyway, this occurs if I boot the machine with the full 1.5GB of memory,
but _not_ if I specify mem=512M in lilo.conf, so there seems to be some
sort of "large memory support" issue.
The system is fine with 2.4.9-ac10, and unfine with these (all I've
tested): ac-14, ac-15, ac-18.
I can get more detailed info on Monday, but thought that maybe someone has
come across this before.
Brief system specs:
Athlon 1.4GHz
Abit KT7A (with Athlon/VIA-bug)
3x512MB SDRAM
2x40GB => RAID-0
Have a nice day,
    Mikael J.
