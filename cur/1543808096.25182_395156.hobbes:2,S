Well, I was able to eventually recover the drive so that it responds 
without any errors and functions correctly.  Though, writing seems to be 
pretty much out of service.   Whenever i try writing anymore (haven't 
rebooted yet since the last errors) all it does is make a strange noise 
like the lens motor is trying to seek beyond it's limits and then I get 
the same series of errors that i originally got. 
If it helps any, I had to run a sg_sync on the drive to eventually get 
it back into a workable state.   Maybe it's having some sort of buffer 
problem that's not being internally flushed or cleared ?  I dont know.
