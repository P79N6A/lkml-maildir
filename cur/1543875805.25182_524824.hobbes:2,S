hm, how about the questions Mike raised (there were a couple of cases of 
friction between 'the design as documented and announced' and 'the code 
as implemented')? As far as i saw they were still largely unanswered - 
but let me know if they are all answered and addressed:

and the numbers he posted:

his test conclusion was that under CPU load, RSDL (SD) generally does 
not hold up to mainline's interactivity.
