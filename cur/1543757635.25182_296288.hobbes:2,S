Linus, Andrew,
As suggested by Alan, here's a small patch against kernel 2.4.29 to 
split the IO addresses reserved for the  PC timer into two regions 
instead of a large one.
It mimics what has been done in kernel 2.6.
Instead of reserving 0x40 through 0x5f it reserves only what the two 
timers need, i.e 0x40-0x43 and 0x50-0x53.
It patches both i386 and x86_64 architecture.
Please CC me in replies since i did not subscribe to the list.
