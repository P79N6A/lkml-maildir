I don't think you even need to set the use count at all for crc32:
As long as another module is using it, you can't unload it because
the exported symbols are used. When those symbols are not known
to other modules, it is also safe to unload crc32.
I noticed another small problem with init_crc: if crc32init_be()
fails, the memory allocated by crc32init_le() is never freed,
see below.
