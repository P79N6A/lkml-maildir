I have another data point on this problem.
I have seen it most with 2.4.0-test9.  But I'll look at 2.2.18pre.
I can trigger this bug fairly reliably by warm booting, several times
in a row.  With my linux warm booting directly into linux code triggers this
one fairly reliably :)  Also putting another nick in seems to help
trigger it as well.
The 2.4.0-testxxx watchdog seems eventually to handle this case 
but it takes 1/2 hour or so to actually kick in and reset the card.
