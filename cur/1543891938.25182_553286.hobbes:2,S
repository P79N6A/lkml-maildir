I changed that script to check my understanding of virtual clock. I 
found out we really got the really fairness if allocate resource by 
selecting the most earliest task virtual clock! this really eliminate my 
doubt on virtual clock in much degree. for example:
./htucfs.py 60
==============================
TASK_1/C10.00 / 1.0 : 11.0 sec
TASK_2/C10.00 / 2.0 : 20.0 sec
TASK_3/C10.00 / 3.0 : 30.0 sec
==============================
It seem my haltingly english works fine when I read the introduction of 
virtual clock ;-)
The next step is find out why wait_runtime can not work normally in my 
script. 
Thanks for your quickly reply.
Good luck.
