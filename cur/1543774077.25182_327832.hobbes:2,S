Something like
	git-ssh/http-pull -w tags/<tagname> tags/<tagname> <url>
_should_ hopefully work now (and the "-a" flag should mean that you also 
get all the objects needed for the tag).
I've not tested it, as usual, but it should work as of today thanks to 
Daniel Barkalow fixing the pulling of arbitrary objects.
