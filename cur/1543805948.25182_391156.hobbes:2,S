Well, the good news is that I was the only real copyright holder back then 
(there's a couple of other people who contributed to 0.11 and/or 0.12, 
mainly Ted T'so with the BSD terminal control stuff - ^Z and friends).
I used to even re-write patches to suit my style (this was back then, the 
patches were smaller, and I was younger and had more energy). So some 
things that others sent in patches for (I think Peter McDonald did pty's) 
I ended up re-writing myself (and in the process I mixed up the master and 
slave pty major number, iirc ;)

I think you can take it for granted that the GPL re-licensing was 
retro-active. I'm the sole copyright holder for 99% of it, and there were 
no objections to the relicensing even back when it happened, so I can 
pretty much guarantee that there would be none now ;)
It was a kind of strange license. I didn't spend a whole lot of time 
thinking about it ;)
