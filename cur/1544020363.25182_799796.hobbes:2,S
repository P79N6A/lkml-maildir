Looks like a lot of changes in drivers, plus: would it work with jumbo
frames? I wonder why the linear area can't be allocated as paged, and
freed with put_page() instead of kfree(skb->head) in skb_release_data().
Actually, at least for some time, there could be used both of these
methods (on paged alloc failure) with some ifs in skb_release_data()
and spd_fill_page() (to check if linear_to_page() is needed).
