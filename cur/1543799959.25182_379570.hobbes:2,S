Linus, please back out those 2 DRM patches of me for 2.6.15. It seems
that they cause more problems than they solve due to bugs in the X
server. I need to rethink the solution. I'll come up with new patches
after 2.6.15 along with matching X.org patches that will check each
other driver version to avoid mixing issues. In the meantime, users will
have to live with the current problem (typically some machines not
waking up from sleep too).
Ben.
