Not everything at once :) To tell the truth I think CPU controller
is even more complicated than user memory accounting/limiting.
No, fair CPU scheduler is not tied to UBC in any regard.
As we discussed before, it is valuable to have an ability to limit
different resources separately (CPU, disk I/O, memory, etc.).
For example, it can be possible to place some mission critical
kernel threads (like kjournald) in a separate contanier.
This patches are related to kernel memory and nothing more :)
Thanks,
Kirill
