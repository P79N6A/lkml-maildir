One could say the same for regular files, so this doen't really
explain why directory sizes are poorly reported.
We do have linear directories that grow from beginning to end.
An empty directory is something like 16 bytes for "." and "..".
The kernel might as well report the fact, just as it reports a
regular file by actual content.
If inaccurate reporting really is OK, then it might as well be
derived from the block count. That gives an extra 4 bytes in the
inode for directories.
