Hi all,
this is not a "kernel-only" question but maybe someone who knows 3ware 
raid controllers (and the driver) could help me.
Currently my 3ware 6xxx RAID controller tells me that my RAID-Array 
(stripe-set with two maxtor 120 GB disks) is incomplete (even if I 
delete the array and create a new one - after a reboot the array is 
marked "incomplete").
The BIOS of the 3ware controller shows me both disks, but one is 
always makred as "available" and the raid-array is missing one drive.
The strange part: the Linux kernel doesn't care about this and mounts 
my array correctly! And the array works so far - it seems to me, don't 
know if there will be any surprises the next days ;-)
Now... should I care about this? Is my array broken or not? And why 
does the Linux driver think my array is ok and the 3ware BIOS not?
Thanks for any help,
  Michael
