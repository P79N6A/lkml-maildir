Cool.

Don't think so. IIRC (don't have the specs right now at hand) SiS5513 isn't UDMA capable.

If I'm correct with UDMA above, this is expected behavior...
I don't know the IDE framework and hdparm enough yet to know if I can trap hdparm
actions at the chip driver level... it may speak (and I believe it to do so) to the drives directly.

Many thanks. My database of BIOS init behaviour will grow, this is *good*.
I'm mostly away (Palm with GSM is kind of... slow) from Net access this week-end and I'll be away too from tuesday
on next week. So don't be surprised if I don't answer bug reports or
enhancement requests in the following days, be patient and don't hesitate
to repost your message if you don't have any answer February the 6.
LB.
