this is interesting. I will look for some sample code in the kernel
tonight but if you have any particular pointers that will be appreciated.

Yes, Ingo pointed that out but it does not look very nice. Guaranteeing
(temporary) that user buffer is pinned feels much better (if I learn how
to use it).

I tried - didn't work. If you are curious, have a look at my
semaphore-based implementation (with deadlock)

Silly question - do the interrupts ever do request_module()? If not, then
we can forget about the above two paragraphs?
