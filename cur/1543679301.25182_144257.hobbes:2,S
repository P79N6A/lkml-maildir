Interestingly, I've got the same with device tun0 on my box, and
it appeared at the same time.
2.5.70 was really blocking as it even prevented a normal shutdown
of the box :-(
Problem is that now, there is a counter of how many "instances" are
using a netdevice... and somehow, the counter can be inc'ed, but
ppp and tun seems to never be dec'ed...
I haven't found where it is, but I made a quick fix in my own kernel
tree to decrement the reference counter each time the message is
printed... This allow my box to stop bugging me with these messages,
and now it can shutdown nicely.
Sorry, I have no other clue as to where it is broken....
Regards,
Paul
