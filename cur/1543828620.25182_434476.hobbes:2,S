All fbdev drivers have a startup mode that should always be valid. All
fbcon does is enable that mode.
You can load nvidiafb like this instead:
modprobe nvidiafb mode_option=1024x768@60

vbetool basically calls an int10 function that saves the state.  This
function is unique per video BIOS, ie you cannot use the state file in
another machine even if the graphics chipset is the same.

No it can't.  Once the card is in graphics mode, vgacon cannot go to
text mode on its own.  It has to know how to write to other VGA
registers which are unique per hardware.
