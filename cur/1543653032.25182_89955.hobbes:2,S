The SCSI host itself has no need of a DMA mask.  What we need the mask for is 
to set up the bounce limits for the block queue, we don't actually ever use it 
again.  Unfortunately, dma_mask isn't architecture specific, its a universal 
property of the block queues used to determine when to bounce memory regions.
The dma_mask is a property of the connection of the Scsi_Host to the machine 
bus, not of the Scsi_Host itself, so it does properly belong in the generic 
device which is used to reflect machine bus attachments.
Think of it this way: we have two struct device's per SCSI host: one for the 
actual HBA card or bus attachment, which contains all of the bus specific 
pieces, and one for the host itself reflecting the fact that it is a bridge 
from the machine bus to the scsi bus.
