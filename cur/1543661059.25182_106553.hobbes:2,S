 Hi all
  Being a sort of god damn tired (sorry), i decided to ask here
 In short:
   My CDRW refuses to work with any kernel bigger than 2.4.1.
It is IDE-CDRW . I use ide-scsi driver for this.
With 2.4.1 - all o'k.
 Then I tried 2.4.7 ... 2.4.9 ... 2.4.19.. 2.4.20 ( i dont remember al of
them) - none works. I get the following:
hdc: SAMSUNG CD-R/RW SW-408B, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
blk: queue c030e544, I/O limit 4095Mb (mask 0xffffffff)
hda: 12672450 sectors (6488 MB), CHS=788/255/63, UDMA(33)
hdc: set_drive_speed_status: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdc: set_drive_speed_status: error=0x04
Someone please help
 I desperately need 2.4.20 for my devices to work, but I also need CDR..
Best regards,
