I checked all mine and they're write through.  However, I inherited all my 
drives from an enterprise vendor so this might not be that surprising.
I can surmise why ordered tags kill performance on your drive, since an 
ordered tag is required to affect the ordering of the write to the medium, not 
the cache, it is probably implemented with an implicit cache flush.
Anyway, the attached patch against 2.4.18 (and I know it's rather gross code) 
will probe the cache type and try to set it to write through on boot.  See 
what this does to your performance ordinarily, and also to your tagged write 
barrier performance.
