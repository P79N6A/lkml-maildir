Yes.
With the scenario you describe there is a confusing case of how do
you interpret uids on the /onedisk mount.  uid mapping may be a more
appropriate strategy to remove all confusion there.

I completely agree that pushing nameidata down into generic_permission
where we can use per mount properties in our permission checks is
ideal.  The benefit I see is just a small increase in flexibility.
So I don't really care either way.
Currently there are several additional flags that could benefit
from a per vfsmount interpretation as well:  nosuid, noexec, nodev,
and readonly, how do we handle those?
noexec is on the vfsmount.
nosuid is on the vfsmount
nodev  is on the vfsmount
readonly is not on the vfsmount.
The existing precedent is clearly in favor of putting this kind of
information on the vfsmount.  The read-only attribute seems to
be the only hold out.  If readonly has deep implications like
no journal replay it makes sense to keep it per mount.  Which
indicates we could nose a nowrite option to express the per
vfsmount property.
I hope the confusion has passed for Trond.  My impression was he
figured this was per process data so it didn't make sense any where
near a filesystem, and the superblock was the last place it should
be.
