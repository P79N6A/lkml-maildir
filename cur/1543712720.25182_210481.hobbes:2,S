You mentioned that your system is an older laptop, and you're setting
"acpi=on" in your boot arguments. What happens when you omit "acpi=on"?
Do you get a message saying something to the effect of your system being
too old for ACPI? Does everything still work as it ought?
I'm still working on this one. 
See

 for more details.
