Ok.  The security issue is easier to fix.  When adding blocks onto the end
of the file, flush them to disk before allowing the transaction that added
them to commit.  This won't be a huge penalty with transaction ages of 30 
seconds or so.  I'm already doing this in 2.3 for direct to indirect
conversions, which is the one place in our 2.2 code that logs data blocks.
This won't solve the kernel.org problem, as it only promises that what is
in the file has been written at least once, instead of making sure the
entire file is there.
