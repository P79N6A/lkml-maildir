This is _completely_ untrue.
The PM timer is (a) inaccurate and (b) slow as hell.
Linux uses TSC because we want high accuracy (nanosecond scale) without
having slow stuff.
But we've had other chips that were broken, and were marked as "don't use
the TSC" for real-time. They'll get worse results, but hey, if intel isn't
going to fix their TSC, that's all the more reason to buy AMD (or..)
