I installed X from scratch and didn't edit any start script. so I assume, that 
it runs with priority 0. The processor is an Intel P4 2000MHz in an ASUS 
P4B266 Board. If I compare the frames per second with glxgears there is a 
slight advantage for 2.4
2.4: 
with DRI 358 - 364
without DRI 181 - 198
2.6
with DRI 350 - 362
without DRI 180 - 187
An even better way to show the differenze between 2.4 and 2.6 is to change the 
size of the xawtv window. If I do that, the slowdown is quite significant. 
But it happens only with xawtv. If I do the same with konqueror or MPlayer, 
nothing happens. A very strange thing are the values I get from ksysguard
Kernel 2.4, glxgears
user load: 3% - 4%
system load: 95%
IRQ per second: ~100
Kernel 2.6, glxgears
user load: 15%
system load: 85%
IRQ per second: ~1100 
Kernel 2.4, xawtv
user load: 2%
system load: 0%
IRQ per second: ~100
Kernel 2.6, xawtv
user load: 9%
system load: 0%
IRQ per second: ~1060 
Kernel 2.4, MPlayer
user load: 35%
system load: 2%
IRQ per second: ~1170
Kernel 2.6, MPlayer
user load: 42%
system load: 2%
IRQ per second: ~2130
Something is causing a high IRQ load with kernel 2.6. Probably an APIC 
problem?
