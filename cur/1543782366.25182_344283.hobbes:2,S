You mean these??
system.h: * For now, "wmb()" doesn't actually do anything, as all
system.h: * Some non intel clones support out of order store. wmb() ceases to be a
system.h:#define wmb() alternative("lock; addl $0,0(%%esp)", "sfence", X86_FEATURE_XMM)
system.h:#define wmb()	__asm__ __volatile__ ("": : :"memory")
system.h:#define smp_wmb()	wmb()
system.h:#define smp_wmb()	barrier()
system.h:#define set_wmb(var, value) do { var = value; wmb(); } while (0)
The "future" black magic that currently does nothing?????

The write ORDER will NOT change. Period. It's a FIFO. Writes
may be cached for awhile. You can force the writes, IN ORDER,
by doing a dummy read.
Too many people like to pretend that there is some black magic.
It works like it's supposed to. If it doesn't work, you have a bug.
