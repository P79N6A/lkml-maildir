Handling them as an ATA disk will eat you up at some extent - whilst you 
can't change an ATA disk on runtime (well, not easily, at least), you must 
be able to change the CD in your non-ATAPI CD-ROM. If we handle it as an 
ATA disk, we'll lead into trouble. Non-ATAPI CD-ROMs aren't ATA hard 
disks.
