This is unrelated to the signal 11 problem, but something to consider
for "random crashes and segfaults", ie are you using this compiler
and glibc version combination.
There has a been a thread on the teTeX mailing list the last few days
about a (RedHat, but probably more general than just their rpms)
gcc-2.9.6 w/glibc-2.2.x bug. At -O2, it can miscompile 
unsigned varname; /* "unsigned int varname;" is ok */
(no problem at -O or no optimization at all, and doesn't happen if teTeX
is compiled with kgcc).
Showed up in the kpathsea library (which began to split paths on
'-' as well as '/' after a user upgraded compiler and libc and
recompiled teTeX).
