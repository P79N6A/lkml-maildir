Thanks Segher. You are right. I did not notice that.

.text.head is not type AX so it will be left out from the linked output.
This reminds me that I have put another patch in kernel/head.S creating
a new section .text.head. I think I shall have to put a patch there too
to make it work with older binutils.
Thanks
