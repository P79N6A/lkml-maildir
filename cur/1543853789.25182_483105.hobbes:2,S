Normally it is supposed to be called as often as there are missing
ticks (e.g. see s390 implementation of noidletick). This is also
true for non no idle tick - the hardware is not supposed to lose
interrupts.
You would need to change at least the existing noidletick implementations
in tree too.
Anyways, i'm sure it could be improved, but in .20 with dyntick
everything will be different anyways. I don't think it makes sense
to change now.
