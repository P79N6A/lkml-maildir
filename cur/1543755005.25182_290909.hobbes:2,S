This seems like an unsolveable problem.

I find calibrate_delay_tsc() quite confusing.  Are you sure that the
variable names are correct?
 +	tsc_rate_max = (post_end - pre_start) / DELAY_CALIBRATION_TICKS;
 +	tsc_rate_min = (pre_end - post_start) / DELAY_CALIBRATION_TICKS;
that looks strange.  I'm sure it all makes sense if one understands the
algorithm, but it shouldn't be this hard.  Please reissue the patch with
adequate comments which describe what the code is doing.
Shouldn't calibrate_delay_tsc() be __devinit?  (That may generate warnings
from reference_discarded.pl, but they're false positives)
From a maintainability POV it's not good that x86 is no longer using the
generic calibrate_delay() code.  Can you rework the code so that all
architectures must implement arch_calibrate_delay(), then provide stubs for
all except x86?  After all, other architectures/platforms may have the same
problem.
