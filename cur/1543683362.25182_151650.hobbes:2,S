If anything, 2.6 will unplug sooner than 2.4. 2.4 will unplug only when
someone does a wait_on_buffer/page, 2.6 will unplug when:
- queued requests exceed unplug threshold, 4 requests
- unplug timeout, 3ms
- someone doing wait_on_page/buffer
Can't rule out a bug of course, the horrible audio skips I've seen in
2.6 are not io related though. Block layer will only do out of band
unplugs for the timer unplug, and even that could be superceded by a new
request entering the queue (or someone doing wait_bla)

CPU or disk scheduling oddities?
People should try booting with elevator=deadline to see if it changes
anything for these types of workloads, AS is really not optimal for that
at all.
