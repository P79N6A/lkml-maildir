Indicates a bug in kacpid or similar. Could you make sure you compile in
"Magic SysRq key" under "Kernel Hacking" and boot the vanilla-2.6.13-rc6
(some recent acpi changes have gone in) and then wait for kacpid
to go nuts and do
Alt+Sysrq+t 4 times and then run 'dmesg -s 100000 > logfile' and
send logfile over here so that we can see what kacpid is up to.
If the box becomes so unresponsive you can't extract the log information
it would be good if you could use either network console 
Documentation/networking/netconsole.txt or serial console at
Documentation/serial-console.txt, both require an extra computer
though...
