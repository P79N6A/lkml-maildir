	Even if it only had one page, it could load half the program in one page.
When the program tried to access the other page, it would fault. The first
page could be discarded and the second loaded. So the system could operate
even if it didn't have enough pages or any swap space.

	Or, if the data is already stored somewhere (if it's a page from a file
that hasn't been modified), it can just throw the page away.

	This works the same whether the place is a file or a swap page.

	Swap space, basically, allows a virtual memory system to move pages that it
can't discard out of precious physical memory.
