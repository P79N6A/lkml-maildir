Yes, I was quite confident of this. However, unaligned traps are a
frequent problem with alphas. For a looong time we had zsh produce
lots of it, to the point of making it unusable. Strangely, the problem
disappeared without changing anything in zsh. It was either a library
or kernel problem.

I'd like it!
