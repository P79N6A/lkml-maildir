When consolidating gcc version handling a bug were introduced.

#   kbuild: fix cc-version
#   
#   cc-version needs to use $(shell to get the gcc version.
#   Before if gave the following error when building the kernel:
#   
#   /bin/sh: line 1: [: too many arguments
#   
#   And all checks for gcc version were broken.
