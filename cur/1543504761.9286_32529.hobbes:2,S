Hi,
  today, HP's USB scanner arrived to my table. This caused me to try to use
USB - and I found, that my BIOS does not fill IRQ routing part of MPTABLE
correctly - it forgot to add PCI slot 7, pin 3 -> IOAPIC#2, pin 19
entry into MPTABLE, only slot 7, pin 0 is there, with mapping to pin 19
(which is probably incorrect, no one acquires pin 0 on PIIX4) :-(
  This causes that IO_APIC_get_PCI_irq_vector will not find any mapping,
so -1 is returned and (pci) dev->irq is left to 10, instead of correct 19.
  For this moment, I hardwired this mapping into bios32.c, as I did not
find any way how to pass this from commandline.
  So, finally, my question is - is it only my BIOS/board broken and I should
shut up and complain to vendor, or are these problems common and some
commandline argument for kernel should exist (so I have to write generally
usable patch)?
                                            Best regards,
                                                Petr Vandrovec
                                                vandrove@vc.cvut.cz
P.S.: Is there anybody getting HP ScanJet 6250C to work under Linux
(either over SCSI or USB) (I have to get it to work before Y2K)? Or have I
to upgrade my Win95 to Win98 and connect scanner to Windoze?
