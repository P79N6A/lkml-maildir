Well, the code looks weird. However, it doesn't behave the same when
CONFIG_IDEDMA_IVB is enabled or not. If it is not, normal case, it's
just:
(drive->id->hw_config & 0x6000)
If CONFIG_IDEDMA_IVB is enabled, it boils down to:
(drive->id->hw_config & 0x4000)
because the second bit test includes the earlier test already only
loosening it. Because of that, it's superfluous. And the code relies on
the compiler to optimize it out.
If written like:
#ifndef CONFIG_IDEDMA_IVB
#define IDE_UDMA_MASK 0x4000
#else
#define IDE_UDMA_MASK 0x6000
#endif /* CONFIG_IDEDMA_IVB */
byte eighty_ninty_three (ide_drive_t *drive)
{       
        return HWIF(drive)->udma_four &&
		(drive->id->hw_config & IDE_UDMA_MASK);
}
it'd be probably somewhat clearer.
