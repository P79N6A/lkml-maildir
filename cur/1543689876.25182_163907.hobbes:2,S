If you reset the terminal via the menu, the terminal will unfreeze (until
the next freeze).
Grab the RPMs from Severn for gnome-terminal and vte.  It will slow down
the terminal I/O and avoid the problem.  I'm not entirely sure whether
this is a fix or just avoiding the problem with more computation (I'm
running on a 300 MHz notebook), but I can now do a "make menuconfig".
