thanks - that's the IPC code that is not converted over from RCU yet.
a suggestion for future testing: please enable PREEMPT_TIMING for the
next kernels you build, it will print such entries at the end of
stacktraces:
 preempt count: 2
 entry 1: cpu_idle+0x38/0x90 / (start_kernel+0x1ac/0x1f0)
 entry 2: _spin_lock+0x22/0x80 / (timer_interrupt+0x1b/0x130)
while in this particular IPC case it's immediately visible that it's the
IPC RCU use that is the root of the problem, the preemption trace
printout can be very helpful in other cases to quickly identify where
the preemptible section was started. E.g. the networking code sometimes
has very deep nesting and non-obvious locking. Thanks,
	Ingo
