Well utf8 would sure be nice if everything used it, and getting nice
fonts for it was simple.

What do you do if the underlying filesystem can not store some unicode
characters that are allowed on others?

VFAT uses unicode?  I thought it used the same codepage silyness as FAT
did, since after all ti was just supposed to be a long filename
extension to FAT.  Do they use unicode in the long filenames only?
I think UDF is a better filesystem for many types of media since it is
able to me more gently to the sectors storing the meta data than VFAT
ever will be.
