I have the same hardware but I have a sb32, a s3virge and I don't 
have a ISDN card and I don't use the aic7880. I have the same amount 
of memory and I think the board only suports up to 200MMX, I haven't 
see 233 in the manual. I have a couple of 200MMX and I usually do a 
make -j4 and it works just great, the load goes up to 4 or more if 
I'm doing more things.
I have a copule of locks while in X with 2.2.0-pre(3,4) (in 5 
masquerade didn't want to compile) and I'll check pre6 and pre6ac1 
just downloaded now.
