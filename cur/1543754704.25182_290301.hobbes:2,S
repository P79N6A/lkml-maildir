Yes. It's only for the detection of the AUX port. I wanted to know
whether the byte we receive in the AUX_LOOP command really comes back
through the AUX interface and not through the KBD interface. Since there
isn't any other information path for signalling which interface
i8042_command() received the byte through, I just negated the value
there.
