blk_size[][] gives a block count
blk_size[][]<<1 gives a sector count
but if the device had an odd number of sectors, the sector count
is one larger than twice the block count.
(thus, this is not the precisely correct test; the knowledge about
the number of sectors lives in the dev->sizes array; here we only
have a rough check)
