The main reasons for bool is:
a) The ability to save space.  No need to waste a 32- or 64-bit word
   to hold a single bit.  If you're on an architecture that has flags
   or predicates you may be able to carry a boolean in such a value
   instead of in a full register.
b) Compatibility with other languages, including but not limited to
   C++ (there is a standard under development for inter-language linking,
   incidentally.)  C++, of course, needs bool for overloading reasons.
c) The ability to cast to bool and get an unambiguous true or false:
     b = (bool)a;
   This replaces the idiomatic but occationally confusing
     b = !!a;
d) Similarly, you can avoid doing booleanization multiple times:
   /* Highly artificial example */
   int foo(bool a)
   {
       return a ? 55 : 47;
   }
   ... could be implemented by the compiler as 47 + (a << 3), or
   depending on your ABI convention, perhaps a caller calling
   foo(x < 4) could be implemented as foo(x-4) without needing to
   convert it into an integer of exactly 1 and 0.
   Given the way C currently does it, you pretty much have do
   booleanize both in the caller and the callee to be on the safe
   side.
