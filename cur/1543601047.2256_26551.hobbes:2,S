I have posted posted this patch multiple times for 2.2 and 2.4, to no
avail -- in fact, it seems no one even thinks this is a bug.
to me, it is pretty clear that hitting MAX_INIT_ENVS _or_ MAX_INIT_ARGS
kills the parse_options loop, when that should not occur until both are
hit -- thus, this patch switches the breaks to continues.
thanks for noticing, I hope it is applied.
