gah, strike that.
my only x86_64 system here survived the test with latest git tree.
my 386 system here has no msi devices and I can't reinstall my x86_64 system 
since it's headless, so I can't test anything until monday. I'll give it a full 
test again and see which 2.6.20rc kernels did fail, most likely a much older 
tree (I suspect).
