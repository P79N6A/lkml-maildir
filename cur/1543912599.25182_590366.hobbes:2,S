It dies in vesa_probe() right after calling int10 with ax=4f01 and
checking the return status, which was 0x004f (success). This happens on
the third iteration of the loop; the first two modes it finds are
framebuffer modes. This would be just after line 72 in video-vesa.c .
I have CONFIG_VIDEO_VESA=y and CONFIG_FB=y, but am not passing the
kernel options that would use vesafb as the console.
