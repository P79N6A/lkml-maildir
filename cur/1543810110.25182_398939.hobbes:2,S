Cool script, you might want to multiply $RANDOM by some factor (I used
8) to catch some more stuff, I know JFS, for example, doesn't put
anything in the first 32k, so the first time I ran it on JFS it did
nothing ;-) 
Reiserfs folks, 
I also found an infinte loop in Reiserfs on 2.6.15, if the Reiser
folks are interested, I've gziped the fs and put it here:
http://burdell.org/~sonny/data.img.breaks.reiserfs.gz
The fs is only 52k when zipped, so its not too bad to download.
This is under stock 2.6.15, sorry I can't post dmesg output because I
end up having to reboot when it happens and don't have time to debug
right now.  It looks like it's in the journal replay code where it
keeps trying to grab some block with a ridiculously large offset.

I see a similar breakage (divide error) on x86 using 2.6.15
