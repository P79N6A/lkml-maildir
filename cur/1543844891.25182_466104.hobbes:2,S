The USB autosuspend patches are still not entirely in -mm.  They contain a
couple of bugs that have to get fixed first.  When they do get merged you
should see considerable improvement.  Note that although they will reduce
the amount of power being used by the USB controllers and will stop the
DMA activity (thus allowing your CPU to enter C2), they won't put the
controllers into D3.  For that you'll have to get PCI autosuspend...  :-)
In the meantime, if all you care about is power consumption there are 
some things you can do.  The easiest is simply to rmmod ehci-hcd, 
ohci-hcd, and uhci-hcd.  After all, if you're not using USB there's no 
reason to let the drivers eat up memory, CPU time, and power.
