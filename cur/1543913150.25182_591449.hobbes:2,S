I wonder if we can say this in a bit more generic fashion.
        A successful write to this file does not guarantee a successful
        set of this limit to the value written into the file.  This can
        be due to a number of factors, such as rounding up to page
        boundaries or the total availability of memory on the system.
        The user is required to re-read this file after a write to
        guarantee the value committed by the kernel.
This keeps a user from saying "I page aligned the value I stuck in
there, no I don't have to check it."
