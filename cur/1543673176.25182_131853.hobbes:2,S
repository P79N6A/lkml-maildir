The idea behind module_param* is to promote conformity, so a module
foo will have command line params starting with "foo.", as well as
easing the burden of double-implementation on kernel coders.
Naturally, this transition will take a long time (ie. forever):
breaking command line params is not something to be done lightly, even
in a major point transition.
Cheers,
Rusty.
