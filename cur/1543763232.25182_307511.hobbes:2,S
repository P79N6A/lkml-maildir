I can't explain it other than "the snapshots are broken."
All I do is look around for them, and behold, just look in
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/snapshots/
for the 2.6.11.6-bk snapshots.
It's confusing and it needs to be fixed....
Jeff, is there some way that I can help to fix this,
with the requirement (for me) that I not be required to use BK?
I'll munge scripts or whatever...
but I guess that I'll also need a kernel.org account to do that.
