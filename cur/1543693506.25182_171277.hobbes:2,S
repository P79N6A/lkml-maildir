Greetings!
I recently got a new laptop (Intel Brookdale Chipset, Pentium 4) and I'm 
having trouble with the mouse.
* Short version:  the kernel sees the Synaptics touchpad, but X doesn't 
(using the 0.11.7 userspace synaptics X module).  X (without the 
synaptics module) understands the touchpad and my external PS/2 
trackball, but I periodically get very erratic behavior from the 
external mouse and synchronization errors from psmouse.c.
I don't care about the touchpad, but would like my external PS/2 mouse 
to work properly in X.
* Long version: It has a touchpad, which the kernel reports on bootup 
as:
    Synaptics Touchpad, model: 1
     Firmware: 4.6 \ 180 degree mounted touchpad \ Sensor: 18
     new absolute packet format \ Touchpad has extended capability bits
     -> four buttons \ -> multifinger detection \ -> palm detection
    input: SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad on isa0060/serio4
I installed the latest synaptics driver (0.11.7) and configured XF864.1 
according to the INSTALL file.  X reports:
    (II) xfree driver for the synaptics touchpad 0.11.7
    Query no Synaptics: 6003C8
    (EE) no synaptics touchpad detected and no repeater device
    (EE) Unable to query/initialize Synaptics hardware
But I also have a PS/2 mouse config in my XF86Config-4, and it loads 
this pointer.
In X, the touchpad appears to work just fine, but the PS/2 mouse I have 
plugged into the PS/2 port occasionally behaves erratically, and causes 
kernel messages like this:
    kernel: psmouse.c: Mouse at isa0060/serio3/input0 lost 
        synchronization, throwing 2 bytes away
I don't really care too much about the touchpad because I always use an 
external PS/2 trackball anyway, but I would like it to work.
Config / more detail available on request.
Thanks!
Chris
