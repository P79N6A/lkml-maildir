I think your numbers are a little low - I've seen between 50%-80% on
master/slave SMP depending on the job. 50% if both processess are heavily
syscall oriented, 75% (or therabouts) when both processes are more normally
balanced, and 80% if both processes are more compute bound.
Good SMP, with a crossbar switch buss should give close to 95%. Good SMP
alone should give about 75%.
My expierence with good crossbar switch is based on Cray UNICOS/YMP/SV
hardware. A well tuned hardware platform, and slightly less well tuned
SMP implementation, though the UNICOS 10 rewrite may have fixed the
SMP implementation.
