Sure, but the point about people not testing the odd release would still
stand.  As it is today, we've been pretty good about only allowing
bugfixes into the later -rc releases.  But I know I start queuing
"bigger" fixes at that point in time, allowing them to get more testing
in -mm release, and generally trying to be conserative.  
And sometimes, people really want those "big" fixes, and they switch to
using the bk-usb patchset, or the bk-scsi patchset.  That happens a lot
for when distros work to stabilize their release kernels.  But that is
quite different from trying to do that for a 2.6.x.y release.
