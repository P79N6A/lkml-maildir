What about dropping block device backed support for the loop driver
altogether? We now have a nice device mapper in the 2.6 kernel. I don't
like the schizophrenic way the loop driver handles these things (and
you'll always run into similar trouble when trying to fix or resolve
this issue). I know this is kind of radical... but everyone loves
radical ideas. ;)
There also a new device mapper target dm-crypt I've written some time
ago, which does basically the same cryptoloop is doing (or tries to do,
whatever ;)) and which seems to work quite well.
I've never had any feedback from the kernel maintainers about including
it into the main kernel. Andrew?
