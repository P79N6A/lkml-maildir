Subject: Configure.help entries wanted

Over the last few week, Steven Cole and I have been working hard on filling 
in the missing entries in Configure.help.  When I accepted the maintainer's 
baton from Axel Boldt, there were 537 of these.  There are now 55.  Yes,
we collected around 50 entries and outright wrote close to 450 others.
That's the good news.  The bad news is that the 55 left are the ones we could 
not document by reading the code and doing Web searches to find context.
All but two are buried in deep, obscure corners of the port trees.
If we take the open-source idea seriously, we're trying to create a
kernel that can be tinkered with by anyone with a bright idea.
Therefore we should have *every* configuration symbol documented.  
Please help.  If you understand what one of these symbols is doing, mail 
me and tell me.  Your English doesn't have to be perfectly polished, I'll
take care of that.  The important thing is that your explanation should
provide *motivation* -- not just what the option does, but why somebody 
building a kernel might want it on.
Here's an example of a poor explanation:
CONFIG_GONKULATOR
   Say Y here to support adaptive gonkulation using the Randomatics 5523
   board.
Here's an example of a good explanation:
CONFIG_GONKULATOR
   Say Y here to enable adaptive gonkulation using the Randomatics 5523
   board.  With this feature you'll be able to cross-wire your frobozz ports
   to a nonce generator for significantly faster foo-counter spin.
Amaze your friends and confound your enemies with your hackerly erudition --
contribute a Configure.help entry today!
