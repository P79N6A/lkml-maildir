Actually - definitely wait for the next version.
Kill the version you have of this patch.
I just realized that "memory_reclaim_rate" was a bogus
name for this feature.  The users, batch managers, don't
give a dang that its hooked into some direct reclaim
point in the kernel.
They just want a decent measure of memory pressure in
a cpuset.
So I am going to rename the flag, to "memory_pressure".
Kill the current 'memory reclaim rate' patch.  I will
resend in perhaps an hour, under this new name.
