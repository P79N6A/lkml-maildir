The basic rule is that if the device works on multiple platforms with
no changes to the driver code, then it goes under drivers, but if
different platforms need different drivers, or it is specific to one
platform, then it goes under arch. However, there are still some
drivers in the kernel that were implemented before the arch tree came
in, and I wouldn't be surprised to find that's one of them.
Best wishes from Riley.
