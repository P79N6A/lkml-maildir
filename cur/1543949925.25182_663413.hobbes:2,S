Prediction is based on cumulative time till "non expected wakeup". So,
prediction will come into play only when there are very short wakeups
due to "unexpected wakeups".

I think best solution is to use get_last_residency that is already
there. If the last residency or expected_us is very low, you can avoid
deep idle states. That way you don't have to depend on jiffies being
updated at the time you are checking it.
