Where can I find more information about this?  The word "tainted" doesn't 
appear in my kernel source code (I guess 2.4.2 is too old), and a search on 
google didn't reveal anything.
The reason I ask is because I'm working on a closed-source (unfortunately) 
driver for Linux, and I'd really like to make it behave as well as possible.
