OK, since this particular case is a strictly in-kernel task, SIGTERM
should be a no-op anyway.  Unless I am missing something in the signal
delivery code, which is quite probable.  ;-)
So the magic code would then be:
	cap_raise(current->cap_effective, CAP_SYS_RAWIO);
perhaps with:
	cap_raise(current->cap_effective, CAP_SYS_ADMIN);
thrown in for good measure.

This would certainly head off at least some OOM deadlock situations.
On the (perhaps unlikely) chance that this was an invitation, here
is a patch to create an API.
					Thanx, Paul
