A power failure might leave you with a corrupt disk block.  That is
detectable (read failure) and you may then reconstruct it using the
rest of the stripe.  This will get you data from either before 
or after the update was supposed to happen.
There is a requirement for this to work: never ever write to more
than one disk in the same stripe simultaneously.  (You can write
to all drives simultaneously, but a different stripe on each.)
I believe this is hard to achieve with the current implementation, as
raid-5 would have to override the elevator algorithms as well as
any caching internal to the drives.  And performance would probably
not be fantastic.  
A simple raid protects against disk breakdown, not power loss (or
kernel crash.)  There are UPS'es for power loss, and
battery-backed caches for further improvement.
