BIOs are for BLOCK devices we want sth. like this for CHARACTER
devices.
I just want sth. along the lines of this:
/* Pin down (COMPLETE!) user pages and put them into a scatter gather list */
int sg_map_user_pages(struct scatterlist *sgl, const unsigned int nr_pages, 
		unsigned long uaddr, int rw) {
	int res, i;
	struct page *pages[nr_pages];
	down_read(&current->mm->mmap_sem);
	res = get_user_pages(
			current,
			current->mm,
			uaddr,
			nr_pages,
			rw == READ, /* logic is perversed^Wreversed here :-( */
			0, /* don't force */
			&pages[0],
			NULL);
	up_read(&current->mm->mmap_sem);
	/* Errors and no page mapped should return here */
	if (res <= 0) return res;
	for (i=1; i < res; i++) {
		sgl[i].page = pages[i];	
	}
	return res;
}
/* And unmap them... */
int sg_unmap_user_pages(struct scatterlist *sgl, const unsigned int nr_pages) {
	int i;
	for (i=0; i < nr_pages; i++)
		page_cache_release(sgl[i].page);
	return 0;
}
Possibly more complicated and less error prone, but you get the
idea ;-)
