Sorry, I didn't explain that well...
This was the problem that Neil pointed out with the existing code. If
the rqstp kzalloc succeeds, but the later kmallocs in
__svc_create_thread fail, we goto here:
    out_thread:
            svc_exit_thread(rqstp);
svc_exit_thread does this:
    struct svc_pool *pool = rqstp->rq_pool;
...and then later:
   spin_lock_bh(&pool->sp_lock);
...but rq_pool is set after the kmallocs, so if they fail rq_pool will
be NULL, and we'll oops in that spin_lock_bh().
The fix is to move the kmallocs closer to the bottom in the new
svc_prepare_thread function.
Thanks,
