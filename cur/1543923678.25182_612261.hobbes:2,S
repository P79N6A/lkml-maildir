I admit the code might be convoluted, but it's perfectly valid, and it 
eliminates the need for "crazy_pointer".  I'm much more inclined to ignore
the checkpatch error than to redesign my code.
Besides, your argument is a bit of a strawman.  The real problem is with checkpatch.

Well, I suppose it's technically possible, but only if my data has been corrupted.
