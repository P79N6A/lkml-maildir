	No, because the file descriptor that they could seek on would be subject to
normal buffering rules. The feature being discussed is _per_fd_ control over
caching of buffers. So the malicious program could not force the hardware to
keep rereading the same small set of pages.
	Of course, a malicious program could cause the hardware to keep rereading
the same _large_ set of pages, but they can do that now. And this would
minimize the harm that would do, because it at least wouldn't blow out the
buffer cache.
