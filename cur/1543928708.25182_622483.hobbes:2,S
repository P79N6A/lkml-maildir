Distributed storage.
I'm pleased to announce the 9'th release of the distributed
storage subsystem (DST). This is maintenance release and include
bug fixing only.
DST allows to form a storage on top of local and remote nodes
and combine them into linear or mirroring setup, which in
turn can be exported to remote nodes.
Short changelog:
 * use node's size in sectors instead of bytes
 * fixed old/new ages for the first node. 
	Error spotted by Matthew Hodgson <matthew@mxtelecom.com>
 * fixed debug printk declaration
 * it is now called 'astonishingly screwed tapeworm'
Overall list of features of the DST can be found on project's homepage:
