Subject: [PATCH 2.5.64] Real-time futexes (priority inheritance/protection /robust support) take 4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi all
This is my second try into implementing real-time futex
support. The patch below encloses a proposal on a way to do
real-time futexes that support priority-inheritance,
priority-protection, dead-owner recovery (similar to Sun's Robust
Mutex Extension) and dead lock detection, a sample implementation
(sans priority-protection) and a set of test programs along with a
very simple thread library to test it.
I have been working on this for a while, and got input from many
different people in different companies who are interested in
these features (eg: Intel, Cisco, Montavista, OSDL ...) We are
also working on a way to blend this into NPTL so it can do
real-time. 
I'd love to hear feedback - specially on things where I just screwed 
up big time and could be optimized really well.
Highlights:
- Currently on 2.5.64
- Does not modify original futexes - a new interface is added
Caveats:
- Timings are still a little bit crappy - looking into it.
- Priority protection not yet implemented.
- Many fixmes here and there that require answers
- Hook for properly acting when the priority of a waiting task is
  changed not implemented yet. 
- The tweak in timer.c is kind of ugly, and needs to be done much more
  generic; maybe even moved into wake_up_process().
Check out kernel/rtfutex.c for a quick roadmap;
Documentation/rtfutex.txt for a longer series of rants and a something
more like a proposal or design
reference. Documentation/rtfutex-api.txt describes how to call the
functions.
Pointer to the test library:

Build with:
$ ./configure --with-headers=RTFUTEX-PATCHED-LINUX-TREE/include
$ make
