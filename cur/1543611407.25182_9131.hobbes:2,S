working 2.4.7-10 from redhat includes definitions for devices rd/c0...
(not in #define(CONFIG_BLK_DEV_DAC960), patch is different)
broken 2.4.9-13 from redhat includes these also in the same way.
(so ...)
broken 2.4.16 does not define these devices in linux/init/main.c
I just tried your patch on 2.4.16. It went smoothly but the 2.4.16+patch
behaves exactly as before, same messages as without patch when booting ...
and kernel panic.
