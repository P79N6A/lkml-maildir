That are not exactly the reasons why people prefer other systems... and the
people who _do_ prefer Linux anyway aren't screaming because of these
shortcommings either.

But as was told here over and again, it is the _wrong_ approach. Applying
this to the kernel just paints Linux into an ugly corner. Then what?

As long as they aren't fed to Linus in a reasonably controlled,
feature-by-feature breakdown with careful analysis of why they are
worthwhile for all here to see and comment or even improve, they won't go
into the mainstream kernel. That is the way Linux came from its (in
restrospect) ridiculous beginnings to be what it is today in such short
time. _Something_ in that way must be right...

First of all, Linux is doing just fine in the server market, thank you.
Secondly, this isn't any game about "market dominance". We both picked up
Linux for its hack value and out of sheer love, in the 0.9x days. I'd still
hack on Linux if there were only a few nutcases around doing so (just like
the good old days before distributions ;-)

They _are_ being addressed.
