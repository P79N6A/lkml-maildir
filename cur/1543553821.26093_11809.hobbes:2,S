Yes, you are right. It was my fault. I should have send my mail to both
kernel and glibc list.
I just want to intercept open call. That's all. I don't care much if I
must do a kernel module or I use PRELOAD. Probably is better to use
LD_PRELOAD.
Thank you all for your kindly help! You are great! All of you! Thanks!
