out-of-date process may not be cheaper, because you may well not find a
factory using it, on the other hand,
with a given process, whatever the chip, the waffer cost is constant,
the difference is whether you put 1000 4-bits chips on a 100$ waffer or
10 64-bits chip.
moreover if you get, say 10 errors (because of dusts, or whatever) on
your waffer, you lose 1% of your production in the first case, and 100%
in the second case (if you're unlucky enough so that you have one error
on each die).
Basically that's why bigger die size costs more than smaller ones.
(PS: I'm not sure of the spelling (maybe wafer) anyway I mean the big
round plate of silicium where you engrave your chip.)
