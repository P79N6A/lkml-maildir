I'd say this is "ready" state now.

Beta.

Drop this, I don't think it'll make it in time. I ended up spreading
the mem-map array across nodes by hand for 32 bit machines.

Alpha, and it's Manfred Spraul doing most of the real work on
this now ;-)
> o Started  SCSI multipath IO (with NUMA support)  (Patrick Mansfield, Mike Anderson)  
Beta.

by both myself and Christoph.
