What for? I smell a bunch of races here - as soon as you release ->files_lock
the value of the function (it can be called only with that lock held) becomes
meaningless.
Besides, locking rules like that (you must hold the files->files_lock if
doclose is 0 and you must NOT hold it is doclose is 1) are sick. We could
make the function itself grab the spinlock, but then the return value
becomes junk before the thing returns it.
