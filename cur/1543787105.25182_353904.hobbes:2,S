Ah, OK, so I am being dense. Fair enough. But if there's a reason to do
that max, perhaps:
pcp->batch = max(1UL, batch/2);
pcp->high = pcp->batch;
would be more appropriate? Tradeoff is more frequent dump / fill against
better frag, I suppose (at least if we don't refill using higher order
allocs ;-)) which seems fair enough.

OK, seems fair enough. But there's multiple "harder and harder" attempts
within __alloc_pages to do that ... which one are you going for? just 
before we OOM / fail the alloc? That'd be hard to argue with, though I'm
unsure what the locking is to dump out other CPUs queues - you going to
global IPI and ask them to do it - that'd seem to cause it to race to
refill (as you mention).

OK ... but it has an impact on fragmentation. How much benefit are you
getting?
