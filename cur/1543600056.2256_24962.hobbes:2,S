You are now browsing the request list without agreeing on what lock is
being held -- what happens to drivers assuming that io_request_lock
protects the list? Boom. For 2.4 we simply cannot afford to muck around
with this, it's jsut too dangerous. For 2.5 I already completely removed
the io_request_lock (also helps to catch references to it from drivers).
I agree with your SCSI approach, it's the same we took. Low level
drivers must be responsible for their own locking, the mid layer should
not pre-grab anything for them.
