I've had one similar report, on a vaguely similar PCI<->PCMCIA
bridge.  It looks very much as if we're not receiving any interrupts.
That would appear to be a low-level problem with routing of interrupts
through the bridge.  It may well be a PCMCIA subsystem problem rather
than a driver problem.

Other than the bogus frequecy reported, does the card still work?
