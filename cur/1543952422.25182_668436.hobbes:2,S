I'd like to reproduce your results so I can make a new
version of the ptc.g patch that doesn't have this regression.
I found this version (that claims to be the latest) of hackbench.c
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/cfs-scheduler/tools/hackbench.c
Is this the one you used?
What was the configuration of your machine (how many cpus, how
much memory)?
Thanks
