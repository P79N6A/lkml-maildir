Ah, missed you point, thanks. Yet another old problem which was not introduced
by recent changes. And yet another indication we should avoid kthread_stop()
on CPU_DEAD event :) I believe this is easy to fix, but need to think more.

If work->func() re-queues itself, run_workqueue() never returns because
->worklist is never empty. This means we should somehow check and detect
that cpu-hotplug blocked because we hold lock_cpu_hotplug(). In that case
run_workqueue() should return, and drop the lock. This will complicate
worker_thread/run_workqueue further.
	run_workqueue:
		while (!list_empty(&cwq->worklist)) {
			...
			// We hold lock_cpu_hotplug(), cpu event can't make
			// progress. 
			...
		}

Yes, that is why this patch only does the first step: flush_workqueue() checks
the dead CPUs as well, this change is minimal.
Do you see any problems this patch adds?
