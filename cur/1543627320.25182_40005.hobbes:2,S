It's write activity, due to atime updates.  I was using nodiratime, but
that's not good enough because every time an executable is run a load of
things are accessed.
I found it interesting that some write activity happens almost
immediately after the access -- and noflushd is connected in some way.
If I do this:
    while :; do cat /proc/stat; sleep 1; done
Then I see a few writes have occurred at nearly every iteration.  I
think that is due to the atime updates, because using "noatime" there
are no writes at most iterations.
But more interesting: I only see those few-per-second atime writes while
noflushd is running.  If I kill noflushd then they go away.
So, noflushd triggers some kind of regular write activity.  Either
killing noflushd, or mounting with "noatime", makes it go away.
I don't like "noatime" because some programs monitor
/var/spool/mail/jamie's atime to decide if there is any new mail.  But I
am using it now anyway.
With "noatime", I find the disk is able to spin down for 20 seconds.  A
record :-)  But not a very useful one.
When the disk spins up, I see both read and write activity at the same
time.  Of course I have no idea what files are triggering the spin up.
(And atime is switched off so I can't use that as a guide!)
I am a bit surprised that "noatime" makes a difference -- I thought that
if noflushd spun down a disk, then pending inode writes should be
delayed until a read or excess memory pressure forces a spin up.
So: "noatime" is definitely required, to spin the disk down for more
than an instant.  But even that is not good enough.  I have 192MB RAM,
btw.  Is that enough to expect longer spin down times than 20s?
