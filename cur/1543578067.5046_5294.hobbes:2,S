After upgrading to kernel 2.4.0, I found myself unable to retrieve mail
from Adelphia's (2-way cable ISP) POP server.  It took several days to
figure out that _one_ of their routers was configured to block ECN.  After
bringing this to the attention of their network engineers, I was informed
that their policy prohibits making any router changes on the basis of one
trouble report.  The person I spoke with did NOT try to defend their
setup, but it was made clear that they'll do nothing until Windows breaks.
If I were packaging a Linux distribution, I'd be sure to have ECN disabled
by default, FWIW.
