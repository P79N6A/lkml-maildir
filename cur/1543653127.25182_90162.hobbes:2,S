while it makes sense, the problem in this case is that the 'TID address'
is the parent's TID address. (ie. might be futex-waited upon by some other
context, for an exit() event.)
i think what makes most sense is what Luca suggested, to split up the
things and use two different TID address: one for race-less setting of the
TID in the parent's address space, and another for the race-less
initialization of the TID value in the child's context.

ok, agreed. Other libraries might choose to still do SIGCHLD based exit()  
notification - exit notification and initial-TID setting are separate
things.
(i'll send a new patch in a few minutes so that we can see the full impact
on things.)
