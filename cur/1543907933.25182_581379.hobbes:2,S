Hi Rafal, thank you for your help!

Please guide me on doing these call traces. Unfortunately I don't have any 
experience at all regarding kernel-space debugging. What tools should I use? 
Keep in mind also that I mostly have remote access to this PC. 
However I am not really confident that the cause is delay_tsc(). It only 
appeared on the libata tests. To summarize I will write down the first lines 
of all problematic oprofilings I've done until now: 
first test: 
3832     23.4818  __switch_to
3380     20.7121  schedule
653       4.0015  mask_and_ack_8259A
452       2.7698  __blockdev_direct_IO
327       2.0038  dequeue_task
second test, with idle=poll (which didn't really help, it seems the cpu is not 
idling at all): 
2477     31.2871  __switch_to
1625     20.5255  schedule
246       3.1072  mask_and_ack_8259A
222       2.8041  __blockdev_direct_IO
147       1.8568  follow_page
third test, libata and idle=poll (the problem felt like it was greater here, 
oprofiling took a really long time):
9556     26.0523  delay_tsc
6424     17.5136  iowrite8
6178     16.8430  __switch_to
4015     10.9460  schedule
3335      9.0921  ioread8
1429      3.8959  iowrite32
So I would assume that delay_tsc() probably only makes the situation worse for 
the libata tests, but the real problem is at __switch_to() and schedule(). Do 
you agree with these assumptions? What are these functions used for? My guess 
would be that __switch_to() is for context switching and schedule() for 
process scheduling. However the context switch rate, as reported by vmstat, 
is not that great to verify the time lost in __switch_to(). As shown from the 
measurements on one disk the context switching rate is greater, but the time 
spent is much less. 
Is there a way to for oprofile to report the time spent in function calls 
depending on the call trace?

None that I can think of. Do you have any specific options in mind?
Thanks again for the help. I guess if that doesn't lead anywhere I'll just 
start compiling older vanilla kernels and see when the problem dissapears. 
But this needs a lot of time and I'm not sure for how long I'll be able to 
not offer any service with those disks (I was supposed to use RAID 0 to 
provide storage space with them, but with the current problems that wouldn't 
be so wise).
