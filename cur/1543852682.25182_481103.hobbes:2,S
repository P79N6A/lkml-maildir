there's no realiable way to figure out the TSC is bust: some CPUs have a 
slight 'skew' between cores for example. On some systems the TSC might 
skew between sockets. A CPU might break its TSC only once some 
powersaving mode has been activated - which might be long after bootup. 
The whole TSC business is a nightmare and cannot be supported reliably. 
AFAIK Windows doesnt use it, so it's a continuous minefield for new 
hardware to break.
We should wait until CPU makers get their act together and implement a 
TSC variant that is /architecturally promised/ to have constant 
frequency (system bus frequency or whatever) and which never stops.
