Hi,
i'm doing the following steps,
1. open a socket on some remote server
2. set it to be non-blocking
3. connect to that socket
4. do a select on the socket
5. read from the socket
6. connect to the socket again
7. read from the socket
and as expected a EINPROGRESS error is thrown on step 3. After I do a
select() and read from that socket, I try to connect to it again and it
connects without throwing an EISCONN error in linux, though if I try to
read from it it throws a EAGAIN error. Shouldn't it throw an error when I
try to connect to it a second time ? Am I missing something here.
