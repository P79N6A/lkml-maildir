Any patch that
-	does not break things
-	fits into the spirit of the currnt implementation
-	offers useful new features
-	conforms to coding style standards
-	does not need more time to integrate than I would need to
	write this from scratch
Unfortunately, many people who send patches to me do not follow
these simple rules.
