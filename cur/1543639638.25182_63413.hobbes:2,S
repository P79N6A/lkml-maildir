As each supported TLS entry has its context-switch time cost, I think we
should stay at 2 supported TLS entries.
My understanding was that the GDT patches were written to optimize the
common case (all threaded apps using LDT and with the advent of __thread
support causing every single application to use LDT), with 2 TLS entries
where one is for libc/libpthread and the other one is for application
usage I think it is enough for 99.9% of apps. In the rare
case someone needs more, there is still LDT which offers 8192 entries.
