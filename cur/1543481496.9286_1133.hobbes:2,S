   I'm having problems with sockets:
   telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Resource temporarily unavailable
   rcmd: socket: Permission denied
   kmem_cache            27     42
   tcp_tw_bucket          0     63
   tcp_bind_bucket     3994   4064
   tcp_open_request       0     84
   Looks like a leak?  
We've had quite a few reports like this, unfortunately I cannot for
the life of me reproduce whats going on here.
So the more information people give me about what is running on their
systems when the problem starts to occur, the better.
One datapoint we keep getting is that the system will come back to
life after 60 seconds of inactivity, is this the case for you when
this problem is hit?
Later,
