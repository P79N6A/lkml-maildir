Fortuna overcomes the small pool size problem.  For the most part, I really
like how the current random.c collects data.  
The only parts we're proposing to replace are:
 - The pooling (thus, mixing) mechanizums as per in Fortuna by Schnier and
   Furguson
 - The random data output mechanizum (Fortuna)
 - TCP sequence number generation (AES in CTR mode truncated to 32 bits, has
   period of 2^32 and cannot be easily determined from pervious sequences)
   I will read your reference and learn from the implementation in random.c
 - TCP SYNcookies to encrypt 8bit "count" value and the 24bit "data" (MSS)
   value with AES in CTR mode.  I can prove that this is exactly what is
   being done now with the "two SHA1 hashes and a bunch of addition" method.
Crutial to my proposal will be not "not rock the boat".  That is, keeping all
important interfaces intact to not break anything else in the kernel.
