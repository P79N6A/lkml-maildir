Yes.
Until ktimers/high-res or another variant gets incorporated into the
kernel, the only resolution you will get for user applications is HZ.
So even though we may have timers that are much faster than HZ (which
there are a lot of them), the kernel only will work with timers on a
jiffy basis.
On a 2.6.13  I get a response of 0.004000250 seconds from clock_getres
with a HZ of 250.
On 2.6.14-rc5-kthrt7 (Thomas Gleixner's ktimers+high-res) I get from
clock_getres: 0.000001000 seconds. And this seems to be accurate.
