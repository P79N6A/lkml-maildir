VGER is overloaded once again, but other things are happening too:
Ohio has some problems:
    smtp/muc.muohio.edu          R=13967  QA=1d23h
    smtp/entropy.muc.muohio.edu  R=527    QA=1d23h
( R = count of recipients to this domain )
Looks like  linux-kernel-owner,  et.al. are unavailable at the moment.
In fact I shunted all .EDU, .COM, .NET, and .ORG target domain traffic
to an AlphaPC-150 running Tru64, but that only after the monster queue
towards Entropy and friends at Ohio had been accumulating for 26 hours.
I *hope* the world doesn't clog up while I am away from office until
24th of this month -- I will be at Linux Expo, like so many others..
