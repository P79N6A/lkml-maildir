Thanks for the replies.
I'd like to underline Alan Cox's reply that DMA0 _is_ usable.
In fact, my sound chip is configured to use DMA0.
If (and only if) parport _cannot_ use DMA0 for some reason
then the sanity check is justified.  In that case I'd just ask
that a short comment be added to the code that gives the reason.
Cheers
Thomas
