Devfsd will create /dev/tty{n} as symlinks to /dev/vc/{n}, som if you look 
at devfsd as an integral part of the devfs system, the system is actually
providing both.
With some good will from HPA and Linus, the standard could be changed as
well, but as long as there is devfsd, the standard can probably stand as
it is.
