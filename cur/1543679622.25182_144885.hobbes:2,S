Petero, List,
Up to 2.5.68 my laptop had no problems with its touchpad but since upgrading
to 2.5.73, neither gpm nor X see my mouse anymore. 
From dmesg:
Jul  2 20:17:38 snapcount kernel: mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
Jul  2 20:17:38 snapcount kernel: inport.c: Didn't find InPort mouse at 0x23c
Jul  2 20:17:38 snapcount kernel: logibm.c: Didn't find Logitech busmouse at 0x23c

Jul  2 20:17:38 snapcount kernel: serio: i8042 AUX0 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
Jul  2 20:17:38 snapcount kernel: Synaptics Touchpad, model: 1
Jul  2 20:17:38 snapcount kernel:  Firware: 4.1
Jul  2 20:17:38 snapcount kernel:  Sensor: 8
Jul  2 20:17:38 snapcount kernel:  new absolute packet format
Jul  2 20:17:38 snapcount kernel: input: Synaptics Synaptics TouchPad on isa0060/serio2
Later on, I get this:
Synaptics driver lost sync at 1st byte
Synaptics driver lost sync at 4th byte
Synaptics driver resynced.
But the mouse still does not work. This is a 'Gericom' laptop, which
contains mostly SiS parts. Anything I can do to help debug this, just let me
know.
I saw mention of special X drivers for this, but the kernel messages appear
to indicate that the kernel itself is not succeeding in communicating with
the touchpad.
Thanks!
