If you have the luxury of the ability to write personalized rules and
whitelist entries for SpamAssassin it can become a startlingly good
filtering system. And you can tailor the filtering for individual 
sources with meta rules. Processing large numbers of messages through
BAYES and large numbers of rules gets quite time consuming, perhaps
more than vger might want to handle. Processing only a small number
of email accounts for trustworthy people allows one the luxury of
custom rules and individual BAYES filtering. Since a lot of what
one person might consider to be spam is another person's ham this is
a good thing. (And SURBL is a good thing, too. It is remarkably
reliable as long as you're not one of the first receiving a particular
piece of junk. The SpamAssassin "RulesEmporium" has some very nice
anti-spam rule sets, too.)
