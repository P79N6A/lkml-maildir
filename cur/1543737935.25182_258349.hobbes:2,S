Couldn't we simply make recvfrom() return 0 (no data) or -1 (whatever error)
in a case where select() had a reason to believe that there were data, but
that the copy function discovered that it was corrupted data ?
This should not impact performance and would let recvfrom() behave in a
smarter way. After all, I don't see a problem receiving 0 bytes.
Anyway, I'm all for non-blocking I/O, but I can understand the stupidity
of the situation.
Just a few thoughts, of course.
Willy
