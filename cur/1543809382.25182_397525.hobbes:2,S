I just don't remember, sorry.  From inspection it _looks_ OK.  But I do
remember getting -ENOENT, looking at the pathnames and deciding that it was
miles off.
swsusp has a habit of leaving a trailing \n at the end of resume_file, but
it was more than that.
And I threw away the patch which exercised this.  Oh well.
(Wonders whether software_resume()'s call to name_to_dev_t() can work and
if so, whether all that stuff as well as name_to_dev_t() can become __init).
