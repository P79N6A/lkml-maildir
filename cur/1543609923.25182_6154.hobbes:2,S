I think the problem is not coming from the llseek+write, but maybe from
ftruncate?  Strace doesn't show any writes for me (only failed llseek +
lots of reads), yet when trying to create files > 4TB I get "block > big"
and > 8TB I get "block < 0" messages, which come from ext2_block_to_path().
In a couple of places (iblock, offsets) we are using an int/long to
store the block counts, don't know why we want to use a signed value
here instead of an unsigned (long).  Looks like changing block numbers
to be unsigned longs goes into the guts of getblk and such.  Ugh.
Maybe also sys_truncate should disallow truncating to a size larger
than s_maxbytes.  Al? For now, returning EOVERFLOW from do_truncate()
when (length > inode->i_sb->s_maxbytes) should be OK.
Cheers, Andreas
