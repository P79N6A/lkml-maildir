Unfortunately (or fortunately?) you can't really get from my patch to
Con's in small simple steps, its basically one or the other. I'd like
to see my patch get included in 2.6, but I'm yet to convince many others.
Con is further along that road, so my only possibility for wider testing
is to try free up mm kernels for possible use ;) (if Andrew will have
them of course). Getting Con's patch more testing wouldn't hurt
anyone though, of course.
