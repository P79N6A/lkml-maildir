Probably only theoretical, and probably the hardware isn't up to it...
But what if we have:
- 64-bit jiffies done in hardware (a counter). 1 cycle = 1 microsecond
  or even a CPU clock cycle. Can *APIC or another HPET do that?
- 64-bit "match timer" (i.e., a register in the counter which fires IRQ
  when it matches the counter value)
- the CPU(s) sorting the timer list and programming "match timer" with
  software timer next to be executed. Upon firing the timer, a new "next
  to be executed" timer would be programmed into the counter's "match
  timer".
We would have no timer ticks when nobody requested them - the CPUs would
be allowed to sleep for, say, even 50 ms when no task is RUNNING.
