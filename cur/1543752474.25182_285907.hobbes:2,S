I'm trying to modify an existing application I wrote to make use of 
kobject uevents instead of polling. Is there a good way for a user space 
  application to determine if kobject uevent support exists on the 
system it is running on? I'd like to be able to detect at runtime 
whether or not I can use uevent or if I need to revert to polling mode.
Thanks
