Well, I've done something like that in userspace. For mass installations
(hundreds to thousands of machines with no interaction, while only a
Windows machine is available in each location ...), I boot off with
kernel + ramdisk (containing needed device nodes and the minimal set of
smbfs binaries to mount the server), then symlinking everything from the
servers into my ramdisk.
This approach is somewhat limited (eg. it needs to fit on a single
floppy for re-installing a totally crashed box) because smbfs binaries
are somewhat large (if you don't cut them down manually:), but it works,
at least for installation.
I guess that UMSDOS' approach *could* in theory be made to work with any
filesystem capable of storing plain files, but that'll need some work,
though:)
