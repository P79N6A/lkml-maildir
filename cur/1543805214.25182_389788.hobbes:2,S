  I am about to purchase new hardware for my Open Source software project but I wanted to make sure that
the chipset was supported by the linux kernel. If anyone knows or has a piece of hardware with this chipset
please let me know. Thanks.
  MOTHERBOARD: Gigabyte GA-K8U
  CHIPSET: ULi 1689 Chipset
