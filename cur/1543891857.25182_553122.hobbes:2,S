The 32-bit sparc port has some but those PCMCIA controllers aren't
going to be supported in the foreseeable future, you have to abstract
out all the inb/outb etc. operations to go through the pcmcia
controller driver for one thing.
Secondarily, sparc32 lacks an active maintainer and it's
been like this for several years, the only things getting
worked on therefore are basica functionality and the most
important bug fixes.
