You need special tools to set up your SCSI config. I don't think, your
Hardware RAID will be configurable by SCSI commands sent to it.
If you have a hardware RAID, it should provide you the possibility to have
config data exchanged in some way. Maybe by providing a device which you can
IOCTL or talk to (and I would use a char device rather then simulate a SCSI
device), but preferably by a /proc/scsi/myraid/? interface.
I didn't look how the RAIDs in Linux do it, BTW. Have a look at the DAC960,
eata, gdth, megaraid, pci2xx drivers.
