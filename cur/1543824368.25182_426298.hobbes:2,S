Hmm, well usually ARM timer interrupts have the SA_TIMER flag .. In
realtime ARM changes SA_TIMER includes SA_NODELAY .. 
In 2.6.17-rc4 
arch/arm/mach-at91rm9200/time.c
static struct irqaction at91rm9200_timer_irq = {
        .name           = "at91_tick",
        .flags          = SA_SHIRQ | SA_INTERRUPT,
        .handler        = at91rm9200_timer_interrupt
};
No SA_TIMER, and no SA_NODELAY , so i'd imagine it's is in a thread ..
