Couple of weeks ago I submitted (for 2.4 series) the patch for seq_file 
that fixes read() behavior to be able return more than one page of data. 
There was quick mail exchange with Alan, he pointed out that there is 
some more seq_file stuff (for "single", by the way). Since that - no any 
information, whether this seq_file stuff is going to be included or, if 
not, at least any reason. 2.4.22-pre6 released with no seq_file changes.
Regarding to this, I have more generic question: is it some way to track 
status of patches? Accepted/rejected, scheduled for xxx version? For 2.5 
kernel, Bugzilla provides this feature. What for 2.4?
Vladimir.
