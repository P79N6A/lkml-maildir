Checking every write is up to the program using the device.  Not 
forgetting this is easy.
Never write directly to the device, use an interface function in your 
program that
both writes, reads status back, and returns that status.

In that case I'd use two device nodes.  One for the command/error stuff, 
and another for
monitoring.  The monitoring device could be read-only and support 
several simultaneous
openings.

Of course you _can_ use ioctls.  Just do it if that's the only useable 
way.  Wether you can get code
like that merged depends on wether you can convince the right people.  
But your driver will work
fine even if you have to distribute it yourself, so it isn't that big a 
problem.

I haven't suggested any xml, perhaps someone else did.  A write 
interface let you pass
almost anything into the driver.  My example used ascii messages, you 
might want to
pass structs instead.  I believe even pointers should work too.

I have to agree it seems to fit.
