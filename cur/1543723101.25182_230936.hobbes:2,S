The below makes no sense to me...  Nothing in the definition of struct bar{} (which
is not packed) infers (top me) in the slightest that foo should be unnaturally
aligned within it.
Just because foo is internally un-aligned, it doesn't become a god-like dirty finger
to with which to corrupt external entities.  If you want bar.b packed up against
bar.a then bar should be __packed__ also.
Given the alignment rules for _empty_ structures as members of structures, why would
a non-empty structure that is packed be less stringently aligned than an empty one
that isnt?
Perhaps I am naïve.

You have not considered what is supposed to happen when this
structure is embedded within another one.  What kind of alignment
rules apply in that case?  For example:
struct foo {
	u32	x;
	u8	y;
	u16	z;
} __attribute__((__packed__));
struct bar {
	u8		a;
	struct foo 	b;
};
That is why __packed__ can't assume the alignment of any structure
instance whatsoever.  Your __nopadding__ attribute proposal would
lay out struct bar differently in order to meet the alignment guarentees
you say it will be able to meet.
