Hi Paul,
  I think it will still work as you describe.  We create a new root-domain object for each pair-wise disjoint sched-domain.  In your case (1) above, we would only have one instance of a root-domain which contains (of course) a single instance of the rd->load_balance object.  This would, in fact operate like the global variable that Peter is suggesting it replace (IIUC).  However, for case (2), we would instantiate a root-domain object per pairwise-disjoint sched-domain, and therefore each one would have its own instance of rd->load_balance.
