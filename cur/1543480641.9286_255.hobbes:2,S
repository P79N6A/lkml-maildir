Hi,
Looking at what some people have to say about other filesystems and kernel
support for them, I have add the following two things in the
features/highlights:
	* Easy access to documents stored on NTFS-format hard disks.
	  This NT compatability support provides an upgrade path to Linux,
	  providing freedom from license costs and usage tracking.
	* Continued support for other types of filesystems, including BSD,
	SCO UNIX, blah blah blah. Both reading and writing is supported.
I don't have access to the 2.2pre kernels, so could someone please send me a
list of all the supported filesystems?
TIA,
