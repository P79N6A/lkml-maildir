You know what I'm going to ask ;)  How much memory?
I wish it didn't have "core" in the name.  A little misleading.
Did you think of making CONFIG_CORE_SMALL an integer which has values zero
or one?
Then you can lose all those ifdefs:
#define MAX_PROBE_HASH (255 - CONFIG_CORE_SMALL * 254)	/* dorky */
#define PID_MAX_DEFAULT (CONFIG_CORE_SMALL ? 0x1000 : 0x8000)
#define UIDHASH_BITS (CONFIG_CORE_SMALL ? 3 : 8)
#define FUTEX_HASHBITS (CONFIG_CORE_SMALL ? 4 : 8)
etc.
I think the ?: thing will work everywhere:
	#define XX 1
	char xx[XX ? 10 : 20];
even this works...
