I was thinking of things like truncate(), which is already a single
system latency problem.

It'll probably deteriorate by an additional copy plus trap costs for
hcalls for things like sockets (and pipes are precluded unless far more
cross-system integration than I've heard of is planned). Userspace API's
for distributed shared memory are hard to program, but userspace could
exploit them to cut down on the amount of copying.

A better way of phrasing this is "the load balancing problem is harder".
