Either event_tail can never be > APM_MAX_EVENTS (I believe that's true) 
and you should use ==, or you should do a proper mod function:
  ++as->event_tail;
  while (as->event_tail >= APM_MAX_EVENTS) as->event_tail -= APM_MAX_EVENTS;
In the unlikely even that the event_tail is already too large you want a 
proper mod, not to set it to zero.
