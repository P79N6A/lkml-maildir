Subject: [PATCH 5/7] driver core: driver_bind attribute returns incorrect value
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/4/14/121

The manual driver <-> device binding attribute in sysfs doesn't return
the correct value on failure or success of driver_probe_device.
driver_probe_device returns 1 on success (the driver accepted the
device) or 0 on probe failure (when the driver didn't accept the
device but no real error occured). However, the attribute can't just
return 0 or 1, it must return the number of bytes consumed from buf
or an error value. Returning 0 indicates to userspace that nothing
was written (even though the kernel has tried to do the bind/probe and
failed). Returning 1 indicates that only one character was accepted in
which case userspace will re-try the write with a partial string.
A more correct version of driver_bind would return count (to indicate
the entire string was consumed) when driver_probe_device returns 1
and -ENODEV when driver_probe_device returns 0. This patch makes that
change.
