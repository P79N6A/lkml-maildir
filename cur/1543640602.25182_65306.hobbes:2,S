You have to cheat. You can tell the kernel that you only have, say
128 Meg of RAM. Then, your driver adds PTEs for all the other
RAM you really have, easy ioremap(). The kernel doesn't know
nor care that there is RAM at those addresses. You can even call
request_mem_region() so that /proc/iomem has your entries in it.
This gets you all the real RAM you need plus it's guaranteed to
be contiguous and never paged.
