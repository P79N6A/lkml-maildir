If it helps anyone I have seen TCPv4 checksum errors on a
relatively simple network connected by ippp (ISDN):
  SCO 3.2v5 -- 100BaseTx -- Linux 2.0
                               |
                              ippp
                               |
                            Linux 2.0 -- 100BaseTx -- Linux 2.1.131
The errors only appear to be logged by the 2.1.131 box for packets
from the SCO box. (The lower 2.0 box doesn't appear to be logging
debug messages to a file but the upper one is).
  The commonality with ippp, ppp and slip would be slhc. However
I _only_ seem to see it on routed packets (I'm not masquerading).
  At home I see it on my PC talking directly via PPP to the Internet
(via Demon) - but I've only noticed it when talking to RedHat sites.
Could the commonality be whether the packets go through a Linux
router or not?
