Ewwww!  You're right, it's horrid.  Anyway, I think this one can be
solved in userspace -- as long as you don't need atomicity.  Untested
code with no error checking:
  #include <fcntl.h>
  #include <unistd.h>
  #include <sys/stat.h>
  
  void report_locks(int fd, void (*report)(int, struct flock *))
  {
    off_t start, end;
    struct flock f;
    struct stat st;
  
    fstat(fd, &st);
    start = 0; end = st.st_size;
  
    while (start <= end) {
      f.l_type = F_WRLCK;
      f.l_whence = L_SET;
      f.l_start = start;
      f.l_len = end-start;
      fcntl (fd, F_GETLK, &f);
  
      if (f.l_type == F_UNLCK)  /* region is free for the taking */
  	break;
      report (fd, &f);
      start = f.l_start + f.l_len + 1;
    }
  }
Alan, is this roughly what you want?
