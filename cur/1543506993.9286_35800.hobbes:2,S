Hi -
Does anyone know why the 2.2.11 kernel will not autoconfigure an ethernet
interface with DHCP when it boots up?  I was using kernel-2.2.9-19mdk that came
with the stock Mandrake install and it booted up using DHCP to configure my
ethernet card fine.  However when I compile the 2.2.11 kernel myself (I selected
the correct driver for the DHCP protocol) the kernel says it configured the card
but I can't send traffice out through it.  Has anyone else seen this?
Thanks.
