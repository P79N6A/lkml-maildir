Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

We are now ready to release the driver to the world, 
Question: Who wants the patch (Linus, Alan, Dave, Mailing List ?) and what format do you want it in, one big patch file against 2.2.9 or smaller patches for each file changed (i.e. Config.in, Space.c, etc.)
Mike
