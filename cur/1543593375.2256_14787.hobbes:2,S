%cr3 is the page table pointer on the x86.  Changing the page table
pointer and changing the stack pointer (from which tsk is derived) is
not done atomically during a task switch.  If an interrupt happens in
between and causes a page fault on a vmalloced area, using tsk may refer
to the wrong page tables.  %cr3 by definition always has the current
page table pointer.
