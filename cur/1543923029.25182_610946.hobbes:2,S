This came up almost 2 years ago:

The problem is that removing that flag makes the children unauditable in the 
future. The only place that flag gets set is during fork. Unless I'm missing 
something, to make all children auditable again would mean stopping all 
processes and or'ing that flag into all thread info areas. I do not want to 
propose that patch to LKML.  :)
