Hmm. I see the problem, but I don't know that I'm 100% happy with this
patch, though.
In particular, I don't see why you didn't just put this in the generic 
calibrate_delay() routine. You seem to have basically duplicated it, and 
added the "guess from an external timer" code - and I don't see what's 
non-generic about that, except for some trivial "what's the current timer" 
lookup.
