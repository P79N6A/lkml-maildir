> You could start by telling people what modules you are talking about.
The modules I need are:
- bridge
- ipv6
- thermal
- fan
- button
- processor
- ac
- battery
- dm_snapshot
- tg3
- serio_raw
- pcspkr
- sata_svw
- libata
- i2c_piix4
- i2c_core
- tsdev
- reiserfs
- dm_mod
- sd_mod
- mptsas
- mptscsih
- mptbase
- scsi_transport_sas
- scsi_mod
- usbmouse
- usbhid
- usbkbd
- ohci_hcd
- ehci_hcd
- usbcore
I cannot found some of them in the kernel configuration.
Isn't there a general way to know what configuration compiles what
module in general?
I need to know this because I'm trying to compile a fully-optimized
version of the kernel for my xen0 domain on my amd64 system.
Is the "lsmod" way correct to find what modules I have to compile to
have a correctly-booting system with a very very small kernel?
Thank you very much for your help!
Bye.
