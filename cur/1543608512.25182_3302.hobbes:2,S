Adaptec A29160 (see above mail). Remarkably is I have a 32 bit PCI bus, no 64
bit. This is an Asus CUV4X-D board.

yes. There is no difference if the file is a) new or b) overwritten. Anyway
both test cases use the same filesystems, I really exchanged only the
controllers, everything else is completely the same. 
Just did another test run with symbios, _after_ heavy nfs and I/O action on the
box and about 145 MB in swap currently. Result: 3620,1 kB/s. _Very_ stable
appearance from symbios.

Sorry, but there was nothing left out on my side. s.a.

Sorry for that, this is unintentional. Though my written english may look nice,
keep in mind I am no native english-speaking, so some things may come over a
bit rougher than intended.

Sorry, misunderstanding. What I meant was: how fast can you read data from your
cd-rom attached to some adaptec controller?

How can I present you an exact figure on this?

yes.

Based on which thoughts?
