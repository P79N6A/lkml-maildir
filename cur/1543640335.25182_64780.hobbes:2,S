What?  If program calls open("/dev/zero",...) and there's no such file,
how the fuck would having devfs enabled help you?
Come on, use common sense - devfs provides a tree with some device nodes.
You can mount it wherever you want (or not mount it anywhere).  Just as
with any other filesystem.
If you mount it on /dev - well, duh, you see that tree on /dev.  If you
do not - you see whatever is in /dev on underlying fs.
If program wants to access a device, it opens that device.  Just as any
other file.  By name.  There is nothing magical about names that begin
with /dev/ - it's just a conventional place for device nodes.
devfs "mount" option is an idiotic kludge that makes _kernel_ mount
it on /dev after the root fs had been mounted.  Why it had been
introduced is a great mistery, since the normal way is to have a
corresponding line in /etc/fstab and have userland mount whatever
it needs.
Said option is, indeed, not required for anything - in a sense that
it does nothing that system wouldn't be perfectly capable of in regular
ways.
But you _do_ need stuff in /dev, no matter what filesystem it comes
from.  Kernel doesn't need it, but userland programs expect to find
it there.  If you had deleted device nodes from underlying /dev and
do not care to mount something on top of it - well, there won't be
anything in that directory.
