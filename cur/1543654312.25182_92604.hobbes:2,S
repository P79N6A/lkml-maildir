May I just suggest doing a
	kernel/compat32.c
and doing most everything there? I think we're better off that way, even 
if it means that "do_nanosleep()" etc cannot be static.

You should make system call returns always be of type "long". Some
architectures may well require that (I know that the alpha calling
conventions do require it, even when using the 32-bit user land. I don't
think Linux has ever really supported the 32-bit stuff on alpha, but the
theory is the same).
And it means that the upper bits are well-defined.
In other words, instead of doing
	s32 sys_xxx(..)
	{
		return xxxx
	}
you should make them be
	long sys_xxx(...)
	{
		s32 retval;
		...
		return retval;
	}

Well, since I want it used in another file, it can't be.
