	[Venkatesh Ramamurthy]  Dont you think that mounting and booting
based on disk label names is better, then relying on device nodes which can
change when a new card is added?. The existing patch for 2.2.xx is quite
small and it does not bloat the kernel too much either. I think we can port
it for 2.4.XX with ease.In my words it is worth the effort
