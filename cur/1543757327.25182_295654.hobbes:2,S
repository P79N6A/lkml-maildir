Well, this will depend on your email server (pop? imap? other?)
being up.  Is it local on your machine, or external?  Either way,
being able to launch an email client (or some "new mail" notification
app) shouldn't be a problem.  It will simply not notice new mail until
the mail service comes up - but it won't fail.  It'll be as if the
mail arrived a little later.
