I have a small K7 shuttle.
On it i have a mail server and a samba server.
I installed Debian Woody on it.
Everything is installed from the apt.
This morning I installed the 2.4.18-k7 kernel from the apt.
my problem is I like to run my shuttle without a mouse, but this new 
kernel refuses to boot without the pci mouse pluged in.
can someone help ?
