Might be a good idea. Ask the author - it's not mine ;-) Looks like a part
of LFS stuff, so may be it's Matti. As for the fix... Well, it appeared in
25-pre1 and grep in patch gives:
-       unsigned long vm_offset;
+       unsigned long vm_pgoff;         /* offset in PAGE_SIZE units, *not* PAGE_CACHE_SIZE */
Methink the rest is obvious. Quick look at the patch confirms that we have
switched from offsets in bytes to offsets in pages. Especially if you look
at the place where the thing is set - replacement of
	...
	vma->vm_offset = off;
with
	...
	off >= PAGE_SHIFT;
	...
	vma->vm_pgoff = off;
speaks for itself.
