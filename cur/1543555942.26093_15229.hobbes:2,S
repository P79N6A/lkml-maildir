Either, or both.
Alan feeds me his patches in small chunks anyway, and does a good job of
keeping stuff separate. Re-sending directly to me means that Alan would
just drop that part of the patch - or that I'd get the patch twice. Both
of which work ok, as long as it's the _same_ patch.
If you've made modifications since sending the stuff to Alan, you should
synchronize with Alan too - just to make sure that I don't en dup applying
the old stuff through Alan.
