Unless I did something wrong, it's apparently not in the USB subsystem.
I have 2.6.12-rc3 and rc4 compiled.  Same config file on a test system.
again, rc3 works, rc4 does not.  I booted rc3 and force loaded the usb
modules from rc4 into rc3.  It tainted the kernel, but it worked.
I booted into rc4.  I do have ACPI compiled so I added acpi=off.  This did
not work, same problem as before.  I left a ping running, the usb controller
was on IRQ 9.  The test system is an old NEC notebook with an Intel chipset
(thus uhci-hcd usb1.1).  I plugged in a Belkin USB2.0 cardbus card (USB1.1
is serviced by ohci-hcd) and plugged the ethernet adapter into that.  Same
problem.
As far as controllers, ALL except 1 (The cardbus USB2.0) has been some
version of Intel.  I have tested this on 4 different systems with the same
results.  An MSI 6163 board, a Supermicro X5DA8 board, a Dell Inspiron 8100,
and the NEC Versa FX.  The Supermicro is running SMP, but I doubt that
matters.
At this time, it's late.  I'll see about reverting files from rc4 back to
rc3 to see which one causes it to work again.
