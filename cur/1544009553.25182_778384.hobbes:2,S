This is a fairly common problem, isn't it?  Other drivers handle it via
appropriate udev magic and initrd/initramfs setups.
Is there something special about ioc4 which requires that it have this
magical special handling?

ioc4 can be compiled as a module.  So if someone does an `rmmod ioc4' after
the schedule_work() and before or during the execution of the work
function, dead machine.
This race is fixable by adding a flush_scheduled_work() into
ioc4_exit(), I expect.
