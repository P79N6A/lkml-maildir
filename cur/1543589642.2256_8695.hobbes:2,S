I think it will be standard before not too much longer (I hope anyway, I'm
tired of carrying the patches forward all the time so I'll lend my support to
getting it into the mainstream kernel ;-)

I agree.  It's something that needs fixed in general, your software needs it
as well, and I've written (about 80% done at this point) some open source
software geared towards getting/holding reservations that also requires the
same kernel patches (plus one more to be fully functional, an ioctl to allow a
SCSI reservation to do a forced reboot of a machine).  I'll be releasing that
package in the short term (once I get back from my vacation anyway).
