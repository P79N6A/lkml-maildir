Yes, that is what I was thinking and is why I mentioned that.  But I'm 
apparently not overwriting the pointers with FDs.. it seems that epoll 
is the cause at this point (unless I'm misusing the epoll API).  I've 
made some changes to now use select() instead of epoll and things work 
flawlessly (although it obviously won't work as efficiently when I 
really connect a lot of clients to this server)
