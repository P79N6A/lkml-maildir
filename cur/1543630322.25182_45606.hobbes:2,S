I agree. In most cases, list.h macros will be used under lock and
putting barriers there will penalize the common case.

It isn't really necessary to to put memeory barriers in list macros
for use with RCU. In many data structures, list traversal is done in
only one direction and therefore memory barriers can be put after
list_add() or such macros. If indeed traversal is more complicated
than that, it might not be a good idea to do lockfree traversal in
the first place.
As for readable lockless algorithms, sure they exist. See
