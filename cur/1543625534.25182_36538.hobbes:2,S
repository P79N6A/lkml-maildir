Polling mode on the PIC wasn't there, true, so it did trigger a
simulator bug -- but the PIC should never have been touched. It was
using the local APIC timer etc. Or at least it certainly seems
counterintuitive to me that the PIC is set into polling mode and EOI'd
when the local APIC is whose timer is used and is where the interrupt
came from. We're using the APIC... why are we touching the PIC?
Cheers,
