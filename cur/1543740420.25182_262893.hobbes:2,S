Hello,
When a user exceeds his soft (and hard) disk quota, a warning message is
printed to current->tty. However, output is a bit offset:
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=blk bs=1024 count=100000
hda1: write failed, user block limit reached.
                                             dd: opening `blk': Disk quota exceeded
This is due to the messages in fs/dquot.c only ending in "\n" but should
probably end in "\r\n".
A patch can be found @
http://linux01.org:2222/f/hxtools/kernel/265-quota_warnfix.diff
 (only use the
dquot.c chunk). Despite it saying 2.6.4, it's still in 2.6.9.
Any takers?
