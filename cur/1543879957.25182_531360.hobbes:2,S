k8temp seems a special case tough.

Usually sensors are attached to SMBUS or available in ISA IO space.
AFAIK they're not enumerated anywhere (at least I2C devices are not, you
poke at various addresses and see if something responds - not sure about
ISA).

Of course. But we do have native drivers ;-)

Hum, the utility I have here (Asus PC Probe) seems to use ACPI:

It seems that Asus exposes monitorining data using "ATK0110" (enumerated
in DSDT); I see it both on my P5B-E motherboard and on my notebook (L3D)
(they have different methods though). Another motherboard with the same
device may actually call it "FOOBAR123" or "WTFISTHIS".
Problem is that ACPI methods are not documented at all (how am I
supposed to know that "G6T6" is the reading of the 12V rail?) while the
datasheet of hw monitoring chips (w83627ehf in my case) are public (more
or less). Furthermore, sensor driver exposes all the reading of the chip
(e.g. in the DSDT I can't find the VSB or battery voltage).
I'm attacching my DSDT, in case you want to have fun ;-)
