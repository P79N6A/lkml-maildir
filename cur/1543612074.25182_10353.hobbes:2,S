  In charge of it?  I *am* it.  At least, I was it; I haven't done much
on it for a few months.  I got bogged down trying to reproduce Eric's symbol
freezing semantics with my undoable data structure, and then other things
came up.  Besides the whole Python issue seemed to have died down.
  The latest (unreleased) code has GTK and curses GUIs (the curses GUI reuses
the CML1 dialog code so it looks very much like CML1 "make menuconfig"), but
is several months behind tracking CML2 language changes.
  If people are interested in contributing, I'd be happy to put the project
on sourceforge.  But judging by the download counter for the last release at
http://www.alphalink.com.au/~gnb/gcml2/
nobody really cares ;-)  It seems my main contribution has been to provide
Eric with incentive to clarify his language spec and speed up his parser.
Greg.
