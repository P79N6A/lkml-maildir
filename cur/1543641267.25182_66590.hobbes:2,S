Christoph,
why do you always feel the need to discourage people who offer their
contribution ? Your two first sentences are quite enough to let Marc-Christian
understand that his patch isn't as good as YOURS. The rest of the mail is pure
gratuitous insults, just like every other mail you send these times (except
those in which you compliment yourself). Since a few weeks, each time I see
a mail from you, before opening it, I ask to myself "well, who is he killing
today ?".
Perhaps you're fed up with crap in the kernel, but IMHO that's not this way
that you'll get rid of it. This list is a developper's list, so it tends to
be constructive by nature. So please be a little more tolerant with other
people, particularly when they are contributing.
Thanks for your attention,
Willy
