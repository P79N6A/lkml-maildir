For reference, I've done some testing with this patch applied and as
soon as I see write errors, processes get jammed in the D state
ultimately resulting in a system lock :-(. I'll see if I can track the
problem down.
I can't seem to reproduce the page error causing bus faults under
current kernels which is strange as it definitely used to happen. I'm
suspecting some kind of broken testing environment was causing it...
Cheers,
Richard
