Refcounting solves nothing.  The problem is that you try to do the
mount handling partly in the filesystem, and partly outside of it.
I hate the idea of this, but if there's no alternative...

Yes, ignoring is perfectly fine.  Unlike the umount case, mounting
cannot cause problems.

You can't do open by inode number (or file handle, whatever)?  Only by
name?  In that case yes, I see your problem.

And so does for setattr() etc.  You can safely return -ENOENT in these
cases.  O_CREAT is problematic only because it cannot return -ENOENT
if the file was removed between ->lookup and ->open.
