I'm working on updating our driver to the changes in the 2.3.30+
kernels, and one of the VFS changes has me stumped (I'm also
changing to use the kiobuf stuff instead of our own code -- that's
going fine so far...).
In struct inode_operations, the following interfaces changed:
from:
	int (*readpage) (struct file *, struct page *);
	int (*writepage) (struct file *, struct page *);
to:
	int (*readpage) (struct dentry *, struct page *);
	int (*writepage) (struct dentry *, struct page *);
But I need some info from the file structure (file->f_pos at least). 
How am I supposed to find it? Or have I just looked down the wrong
path? I suppose that I should look at how ext2 did it?
thanks!
