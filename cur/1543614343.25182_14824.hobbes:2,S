Hmm. Not my plan at the time of typing, no.
But KB _is_ ambiguous. KiB is not (and it's ugliness is actually an advantage
here - it's less likely to be misused by people who've not seen the definition).
Just out of curiosity, is there anywhere in the kernel space where KB (et al)
is _not_ used to mean a power of 2 value?
