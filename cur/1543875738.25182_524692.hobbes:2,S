The difference between x86_64 and i386 is that on i386 we now switch off
the PIT and do the jiffies increment in the local apic timer interrupt.
This is necessary for NO_HZ and HIGH_RES_TIMERS. We just fall back to
the PIT in C3 (enforced to C2 now due to massive breakage).
You can see the same problem on x86_64 by adding "apicmaintimer" to the
kernel command line. This should make your box really slow.

Right, but it does bad magic when running on battery. The offsets you
observe are due to the LAPIC stops. The delta is rather small, because
you wake up via the PIT periodically, so the APICs start to run as well.
And they do it on both cores.
Someone should apply a huge clue stick to BIOS developers.
I have some experimental code to detect the LAPIC breakage during run
time, but this needs more thought and is definitely not 2.6.21 material.
