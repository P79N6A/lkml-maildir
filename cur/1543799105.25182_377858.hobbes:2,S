Jens, your logic doesn't make sense.
There clearly _are_ commands with a 0 data-length.
And commands _have_ to be either READ or WRITE. We don't have a choice. 
ll_rw_block: blk_get_request() even has a BIG_ON() that enforces that.
So claiming that reads and writes cannot have zere data-length is INSANE.
So reads and writes HAVE to accept a zero data length. End of story. If 
there is some path in the SCSI layer that refuses it, that part must be 
fixed, or you have to add a new "NONE" (and perhaps "BOTH") direction.
