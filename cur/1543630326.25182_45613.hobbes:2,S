I did use memtest86 and all test is passed, no errors.
And problem still persists with 2.4.19-pre8-ac2 ; oops
after exiting X 
Now I have to use 2.4.16 ; any way all kernel before
2.4.19-pre2 is normal, I did not test 2.4.19-preX>2
but 2.4.19-pre7-ac4 and 2.4.19-pre8-ac2
sounds a kernel bug to me :-)
Hope that it will soon be fixed.
