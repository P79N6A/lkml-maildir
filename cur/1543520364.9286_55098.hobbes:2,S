... which, in turn, has its own inherent scaling problems.
care to have 30,000 simultaneous streams open?
last time i looked, context was held on a per-user-thread.  there was some 
relatively-recent discussion on changing its semantics to no longer be a 
blocking syscall, but i don't think there much final consensus out of that.
cheers,

PS. sendfile might be useful for sending from one stream to another.  but 
not-so when you want to stream (a) out of memory, (b) non-stream traffic 
(eg. multicast), and/or (c) scatter-gather from [another] i/o device.
