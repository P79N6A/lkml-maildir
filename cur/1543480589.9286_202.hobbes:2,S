If I remember correctly there was a thread about this not so long ago.
Apparently there is some debug output left in the kernel sys_ptrace in
arch/i386/ptrace.c calls print_child_state or some such. However, neither my
primary or vanilla 2.2.0-pre7 source trees have it any more, so I guess you're
not running the version you think you are (either that or I've got my source
dirs really confused..)
Cheers,
Steve
