Howdy,
   We are migrating from ext3 to jfs and had a weird error.  We have a
dual pentium III 1.4 ghz system.  We have 4GB of ram, and a Mylex
AcceleRAID 170 [DAC960] controller. Intel pro/100 nics, nothing else too
special.  The motherboard chipset is ServerWorks.  We added a 40GB ide
drive to the onboard controller.  It has jfs on it, and we are using
this for the migration.  We have been backing up to it for a few days,
and it went read-only on us.  
  I have dtree page corrupt errors, but no hardware errors.  jfs fsck
errors out as well.
  We saw a load of errors like this in the dmesg:
ERROR: (device ide0(3,1)): DT_GETPAGE: dtree page corrupt
ERROR: (device ide0(3,1)): DT_GETPAGE: dtree page corrupt
ERROR: (device ide0(3,1)): DT_GETPAGE: dtree page corrupt
ERROR: (device ide0(3,1)): DT_GETPAGE: dtree page corrupt
