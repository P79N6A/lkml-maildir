Not true if the timesource is different from interrupt source.
Consider PM timer for timesource, and PIT for interrupt source. Reprogamming
PIT should not affect PM timer. Time is always updated from PM timer.

I guess it should be safe to reprogram timer even if other CPUs are not
idle, assuming the busy CPUs reprogramming timer will also wake up the idle
CPUs.
There's one thing that should be considered though; Reprogamming
timers should be avoided if the system is busy as it causes
performance issues. Especially reprogramming PIT.
Andi, where's your latest x86-64 patch BTW? I'd like to try it out
on my laptop :)
