About your script changes, I like to make it portable, and I use the 
following versions:
GNU bash, version 2.05b.0(1)-release (i386-redhat-linux-gnu)
dd (coreutils) 4.5.3
What shell and coreutils are you using?
Avoiding short counts is easy but avoiding C-style expressions is primitive
-     count=100K
+     count=100000
-   while (( i-- )); do
+   while (( i=`expr $i - 1` )); do
In your opinion are your changes more portable across a wide range of systems?

It has a hard time to read anything else, the slower the disk, the worse. 
Suppose rmap undoes the fixes introduced in -rc6. 
Have you tried -rc6 plain?
