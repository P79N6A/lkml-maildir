Hi,
I am pretty new in coding for the kernel and I was wandering what is the
_deep_ meaning of:
"Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address XXXX" 
and 
"Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference".
If somebody could explain this to me, I would be very pleased ! :)
PS: I know already how to trace an Oops by using ksymoops. But these two
errors are puzzling me and I would like to understand more about it.
Regards
