Plug that 'Code:' line into ksymoops and you get 
Code;  fffffffb <__kernel_rt_sigreturn+1bbb/????>
  26:   89 c3                     mov    %eax,%ebx
Code;  fffffffd <__kernel_rt_sigreturn+1bbd/????>
  28:   89 14 24                  mov    %edx,(%esp)
Code;  00000000 Before first symbol
  2b:   8b 90 b4 00 00 00         mov    0xb4(%eax),%edx
Code;  00000006 Before first symbol
  31:   85 d2                     test   %edx,%edx
Code;  00000008 Before first symbol
  33:   75 04                     jne    39 <_EIP+0x39>
(etc.).
The "Code;    00000000..." is the current EIP.
So the operation it was performing was
       mov 0xb4(%eax),%edx
Now I am no Pentium, but when I add 0xb4 to dfcdaba0 I don't get
ea86ac54.
My result is more like
dfcdac54.
So it looks like your Pentium (or whatever) got it half-right.
i.e. the bottom 16 bits are right, but the top are wrong by 0ab9.
I'd be taking a very serious look at your hardware.  This is not a
software problem.
