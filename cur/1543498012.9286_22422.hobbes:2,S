According to a pair of Oops' I just forced, it is caused by a deadlock
in do_try_to_free_pages.
kswapd does:
>>EIP: c0112547 <smp_flush_tlb+57/90>

Trace: c0106000 <empty_zero_page+1000/1004>
Trace: c0107399 <kernel_thread+2d/40>
Which holds the kernel lock and spins waiting for the other processor to
acknowledge the TLB IPI.  However, the other processor (in SMP) does:
>>EIP: c0196b87 <stext_lock+f67/3e60>
Trace: c0127e37 <try_to_free_pages+33/44>
Trace: c0128683 <__get_free_pages+6b/1d0>

Trace: c01156a0 <send_sig_info+1c0/2f8>
Trace: c0115a8e <kill_something_info+10a/11c>
Which spins on the kernel lock in do_try_to_free_pages() also.  Thus, CPU
#1 has the lock and wants the TLB IPI serviced but CPU #2 needs the lock to
continue handling its current interrupt before it can handle the TLB IPI.
Deadlock.
I have forwarded details of the oops to Andrea, SCT, Alan, and Ingo, the
people I had contacted with questions prior to generating the oops and
finding the above pattern.
Of course, I could be totally wrong, but those traces above look mighty
incriminating. :)
