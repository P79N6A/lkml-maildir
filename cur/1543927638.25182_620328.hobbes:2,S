That certainly looks fine.  I would also replace the 'return' with
'break', but I guess that's more of a question of personal preference.

This doesn't look fine.  Did you test this?
mntput_no_expire() is called from mntput() which is an inline function
in mount.h.  So lots of callers of mntput() in modules will end up
trying to call mntput_no_expire() from modules.
$ nm fs/fuse/fuse.ko | grep mntput_no_expire
                 U mntput_no_expire
