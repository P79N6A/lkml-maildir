You "fixed" it by using GFP_ATOMIC but didn't test the result of
kmalloc. That is very bad. GFP_ATOMIC can fail (return NULL), thus
you will crash the kernel under high memory pressure.
I think the proper fix is, as you asked me, using a workqueue,
that way, you can both use GFP_KERNEL allocations, and avoid
the spinlock you added to fbmem.c, thus letting the fb_sync()
ops on fbdev's be able to block.
