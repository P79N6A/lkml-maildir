The operations whereby
(1) a process is in the process of exiting while;
(2) the kernel is doing a coredump
is asynchronous with respect to each other, since the process could have 
received an abort signal while the the kernel initiated the core dump.

When a child exits, check if the core dump file is still opened by a handle 
(HINT: lsof).
AFAICS from the kernel code, the core dump data or file routine is mutexed 
to ensure that there is only one process handling the core dump file.
You could check if there are still open file handles on the dump.  If there 
are none, it means that the dump had been completed.
HTH.
