Subject: What happened to XFS Quota Support?

In previous Linux kernels -- 2.6.13 and below --  XFS quota could be set 
"statically" -- that is, in "make xconfig" you could put  a "check mark" in the 
XFS_quota support box even though you had a "dot" (module)  in the Overall 
XFS_Filesystem support box . 
In 2.6.14, not only has XFS  support moved under filesystems with all the 
other filesystems, but you can no  longer put a "checkmark" in the "quota 
support" box if you compile XFS support  as a module. 
Is this by design? Looking back at all of my past kernels,  xfs is enabled as 
a module but quota support is enabled statically. This is how  config files 
have been coming from Mandrake for at least the past year.  
Is there a reason why this option is no longer available? If you compile  
xfs_quota as a module, how do you load it?
