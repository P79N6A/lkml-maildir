Alas the length of "ieee1394_" gets in the way of readability.
There are currently no exported symbols starting with "fw_":
linux-2.6.19 $ find . -type f -exec grep -e 'EXPORT.*fw_' {} \;
EXPORT_SYMBOL(iop_fw_load_spu);
EXPORT_SYMBOL(iop_fw_load_mpu);
EXPORT_SYMBOL(hostap_check_sta_fw_version);
EXPORT_SYMBOL(mpt_alloc_fw_memory);
EXPORT_SYMBOL(mpt_free_fw_memory);
There are a few names of struct members starting with "fw_" and four
global variables on the MIPS architecture:
linux-2.6.19 $ find include/ -type f -exec grep -e '[ ]fw_' {} \;
        __u64 fw_ver;
            unsigned char fw_mpx_cap; /* forward multiplexing capability */
        unsigned long fw_vendor;        /* physical addr of CHAR16 vendor string */
        u32 fw_revision;
        int             fw_rev[MAX_BOARD];
        char fw_version[2];                /* major = [0], minor = [1] */
        u64 fw_flags;
extern unsigned long fw_arg0, fw_arg1, fw_arg2, fw_arg3;
linux-2.6.19 $ find include/ -type f -exec grep -l '[ ]fw_' {} \;
include/rdma/ib_user_verbs.h
include/linux/atmsap.h
include/linux/efi.h
include/linux/cyclades.h
include/sound/snd_wavefront.h
include/asm-alpha/gct.h
include/asm-mips/bootinfo.h
There are a few constants starting with "FW_":
linux-2.6.19 $ find include/ -type f -exec grep -e '[ ]FW_' {} \;|wc -l
38
linux-2.6.19 $ find include/ -type f -exec grep -l '[ ]FW_' {} \;
include/linux/firmware.h
include/video/radeon.h
include/asm-powerpc/pmac_feature.h
include/asm-powerpc/firmware.h
include/asm-ppc/residual.h
Since cross-subsystem drivers like sbp2 (a SCSI driver) and eth1394 (a
networking driver) live in linux/drivers/ieee1394/, the IEEE 1394 subsystem
does not need to ship header files in linux/include/, except for the minimum
stuff in linux/include/linux/mod_devicetable.h. Therefore the only conflicts
that the IEEE 1394 subsystem code could create would be via its EXPORTs.
I would therefore prefer "fw_" or "hpsb_" over any of the other suggestions
made here:
  - ieee1394_ makes sense in linux/mod_devicetable.h but is too long
    otherwise.
  - fiwi_, frwr_, and fwire_ are artificial abbreviations which come very
    unnatural. (fw_ is an artificial abbreviation too but is not as awkward
    as the others. hpsb_ is not just an abbreviation, it is an established
    acronym of the canonical name of the bus.)
