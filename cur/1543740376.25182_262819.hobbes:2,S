It's a generic problem with compiling modules outside of
the kernel. The attached module, complete with its Makefile
shows the problem.
We really need to fix such problems because, to use the
same kernel for a development effort means that the kernel
sources are on some NFS server, not writable by developers.
They have write permissions only for their own workstations.
Therefore, one can't copy their sources to the kernel tree,
modify .config and then develop their modules.
