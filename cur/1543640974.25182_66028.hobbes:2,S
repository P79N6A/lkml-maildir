Do you think it's useful to temporarily put a lock counter into struct 
task (TEMPORARILY, Linus, temporarily!) and check that as well? Maybe that 
will point us something.
Or we should extend that whole crap a bit so we could see exactly what 
caused the preemption count to rise. I don't know if we can do that, but 
we can try doing that.
