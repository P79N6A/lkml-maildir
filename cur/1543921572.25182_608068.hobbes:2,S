that looks like a cut-and-paste error since the file
include/asm-um/arch/ptrace-abi.h opens with:
=====
#ifndef _ASM_X86_PTRACE_ABI_H
#define _ASM_X86_PTRACE_ABI_H
#ifdef __i386__
#define EBX 0
#define ECX 1
#define EDX 2
#define ESI 3
#define EDI 4
#define EBP 5
#define EAX 6
#define DS 7
#define ES 8
#define FS 9
#define GS 10
#define ORIG_EAX 11
#define EIP 12
#define CS  13
#define EFL 14
#define UESP 15
.....
=====
  somehow, that doesn't look right.
