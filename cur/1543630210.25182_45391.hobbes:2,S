Only historical and a hatred of cpp's "# line file" stuff, and the fact
that ARM needs to use sed elsewhere in the build to get around broken
GCC %c0 stuff.
I think we could actually get rid of the preprocessing of the linker
files - see ld's defsym argument.

Eww, so I can't use "find . -name '*.[cS]'" to find all the C source and
assembly source with kbuild 2.5 because we've got pollution of the .S
extension?

I'm not a fan of dont-diff stuff myself - I'd rather ensure a clean
source tree and then diff rather than diffing a dirty built tree.
dont-diff stuff needs to be maintained and extended as stuff changes
in the kernel tree, and lets face it, no amount of extension pollution
will prevent it from being updated over time.
