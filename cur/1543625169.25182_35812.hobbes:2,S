It's not automatic, but oldconfig defaults to "N" so 'make oldconfig' and
hold down <ENTER>...
This is a one time thing (2.4 -> 2.5) so why write a script for it?
Does anyone have any reasons why James couldn't just start compiling with a
previous .config?  
hmm, maybe I should check the FAQ...
... nope, only one occourance of "oldconfig" and that didn't help...
