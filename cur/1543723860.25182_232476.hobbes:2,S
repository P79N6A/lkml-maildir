Please follow these instructions:
1.  STFU
2.  Log in as root
3.  emerge apache
4.  Set up a local web server with a large file on it
5.  wget -c the file over your network with each kernel, from another
computer on the local network.
Erik's said several times now to use a local server.  He's right.
You're not.  Probability is against him; but you're still in the box
with schrodinger's cat, so you can't give any sort of guarantee either.
~ His method *does* give a controlled experiment which supplies said
guarantee.
