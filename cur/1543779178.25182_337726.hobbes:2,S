Quoting Tony Jones (tonyj@immunix.com):
Thanks, Tony.  I'll address each of these in the next patchset.  Just
two things I wanted to actually converse about:

And is it ok with using the "some_data (apparmor)" convention?
The special handling of selinux is intended to be temporary, due to the
large base of installed userspace which hasn't yet been updated.  I
would imagine that at some point that code would go away.

Yes, after I added the unlink function, it started to seem that the
special cases for !CONFIG_SECURITY_STACKER wouldn't be any faster than
the stacker versions.  They still might be, but I'll have to think about
it.  If I just ditch those, then I can probably ditch the whole
security-stack.h file, and move those declarations into security.h.
They were just in their own file because Stephen had pointed out that
switching between stacker and non-stacker would cause too much code to
be recompiled.
thanks,
