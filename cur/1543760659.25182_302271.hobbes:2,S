Subject: spin_lock error in arch/i386/kernel/time.c on APM resume

On APM resume this morning on my Thinkpad X31, I got a "spin_lock is
already locked" error; see below.  This doesn't happen on every resume,
though it's happened before.  The kernel is 2.6.11 plus a bunch of
(hopefully unrelated...) NFS patches.
Any ideas?
