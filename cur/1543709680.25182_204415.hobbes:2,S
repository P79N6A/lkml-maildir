   Looks like that driver is related to SysKonnect's  sk98lin  driver.
   It has been branched around december 2002, merging possible missing
   support features to sk98lin baseline would be most usefull. ...
   If anything, present sk98lin  knows _more_ devices, than 3c2000
   driver, including all that 3c2000 knows.  And sk98lin knows about
   IPv4 checksum offloading...
