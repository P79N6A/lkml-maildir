Having just had another hang.. I tried booting with nmi-watchdog=1 and
then with 2.
I am currently running from the boot with 2 selected.
In my current dmesg I have these which dont normally appear and didnt
appear in the boot with 1 set.
Any ideas?
hda: IRQ probe failed (0xfffffcfa)
hdb: IRQ probe failed (0xfffffcfa)
hdb: IRQ probe failed (0xfffffcfa)
