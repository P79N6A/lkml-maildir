I've reproduced the drops at very low baud rates.  I didn't take notes, 
but I think that I was getting the same sort of behavior at about 
19.2Kb as 115Kb.
It really doesn't look like a speed thing.  The CPU is >1Ghz and the CPU 
usages is always below 10%.   Since it works with a 16550 (interrupting 
every 16? bytes) and not on a 16654 (interrupting every 64? bytes), it 
doesn't seem like something is too slow.
