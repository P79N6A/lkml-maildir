That one looks pretty straightforward.
arch/i386/kernel/timers/timer_tsc.c really looks like fun.  So many
corner cases...
BTW shouldn't this code from mark_offset_tsc():
402         if (pit_latch_buggy) {
403                 /* get center value of last 3 time lutch */
404                 if ((count2 >= count && count >= count1)
405                     || (count1 >= count && count >= count2)) {
406                         count2 = count1; count1 = count;
407                 } else if ((count1 >= count2 && count2 >= count)
408                            || (count >= count2 && count2 >= count1)) {
409                         countmp = count;count = count2;
410                         count2 = count1;count1 = countmp;
411                 } else {
412                         count2 = count1; count1 = count; count = count1;
413                 }
414         }
use an ifdef?  It only applies to cyrix_55x0, and mark_offset_tsc is a
pretty hot path.
