Klibc is a neat hack, but makes little sense. In the end we wind up
with _more_ code to maintain, not less. The boot process becomes
more complicated too. A microkernel by any other name still smells. :-)
Not all of us have 2 GHz boxes BTW.
Moving partition code out of the kernel is just begging for bugs
and limited functionality. The EVMS people have the right idea.
Does anyone else remember the user-space isapnp disaster? I do.
Users everywhere were screaming "my sound card won't work".
