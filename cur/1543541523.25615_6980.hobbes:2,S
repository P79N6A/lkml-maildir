Hello!
Recently I discovered that my Creative SB32 PnP refuses
to work under 2.4.0 test kernel, so here is the patch to
make the things right.
Please, forward this message to a right person (in general,
Linux source code maintainer, I suppose?). 
Thank you very much!
Sincerely yours,
			Ivan <skywriter@rnc.ru>
