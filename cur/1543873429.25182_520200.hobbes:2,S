No, I don't think that's true.  I implemented the write_*_entry
functions with the assumption they could be called either on setup or on
an in-use entry.  I think its good policy to use it all the time anyway,
since the pv_ops backend might want to fiddle with the values on the way
through.
I tried to avoid calling init_gdt twice, but it seemed cleaner to just
let it happen.

Yes.  I think its definitely a good idea to call init_gdt asap after
doing the percpu setup.

It doesn't?  The per-cpu gdt is the same as the boot gdt?
