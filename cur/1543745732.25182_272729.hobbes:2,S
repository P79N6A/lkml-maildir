Subject: [Patch 1/3]: ext3: cleanup handling of aborted transactions.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch improves ext3's error loggin when we encounter an on-disk
corruption.  Previously, a transaction (such as a truncate) which
encountered many corruptions (eg. a single highly-corrupt indirect
block) would emit copious "aborting transaction" errors to the log.
Even worse, encountering an aborted journal can count as such an
error, leading to a flood of spurious "aborting transaction: Journal
has aborted" errors.
With the fix, only emit that message on the first error.  The patch
also restores a missing \n in that printk path.
