If so, then a better fix would be to go through all filesystems and all
other users of mark_buffer_dirty(bh, flag) and change them to
mark_buffer_dirty(bh) - i.e. remove the flag argument altogether. If it
stays but has no effect it will only confuse the matters.
Also, the age_super parameter for bdflush must be replaced with 'dummy1'
in fs/buffer.c.
Do you agree with this? I can make this patch and test it quickly.
Regards,
Tigran
