no-no-no.  I DON'T mean that OS will reprogram the BARs underneath you.
Only that it is the responsibility of the OS to program the BARs, and
that you should be getting the BAR info out of dev->resource[].
Note only does this make the code much cleaner, but this gives us a lot
more flexibility about when and how we program the PCI bus.  The PCI
driver only needs to know the location and size of the region it needs
to access.  If the OS, in the future, has to support some weird IOMMU or
PCI mapping capabilities, we don't have to go through and change all the
drivers which are suddenly broken by this new hardware... we just change
it in one canonical place: the PCI core.  (at this point the lecture
turns into why APIs exist and should be used, and it gets more boring
from there...)
