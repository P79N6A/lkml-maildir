Subject: reiserfs - difference between a commit and a transaction

I am trying to do some work on reiserfs to make it laptop-mode
compliant. After looking at the code because it was still noisy after I
thought I told correctly to be quite, raised a question that I was
hoping someone can clarify for me.
Reiserfs has both a transaction and a commit and I was wondering what
is which.
(I am mostly interested in this from the point of what max_trans_age
and max_commit_age affect)
Thanks
