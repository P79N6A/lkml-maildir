From an application (userspace) or from inside the kernel?
There are many "howto add a system call to Linux" web pages
out there (use google).  Oh, you want "howto do a system call."
From userspace, usually use a library:  app calls library
function, which does the syscall.  Or you can roll your
own syscalls.  The howtos on adding a system call to Linux
usually show you how to do that part also.[1]
