Of course I don't want THIS patch included (which solves the problem in an
unelegant/ hard to mantian way).
But it would be nice if Linux could deliver these latencies (of course
implemented in a clean way) before the next century.  :-)
And this will be one of the few hurdles remaining which currently hinder desktop
users to get rid of M$ ware.

then try it and let us know   :-)
the more people , the better .....
I agree that all my tests are "only" empirical, I have it tested only on 4 boxes
but I did not encounter problems (except that an asus motherboard with APM
turned on caused latency spikes at regular intervals, but after turining APM
off, the diagrams looked ok.

to quote Richard "My guess is you'll be digging yourself in deeper and deeper
..."
I see RTLinux vs lowlatency kernel  like 
solving  f(x)=0   in an exact and aproximate way  (for example Newton's  xn+1 =
xn -f(x)/f'(x) )
RTLinux is the "exact" solution but is "expensive"
low-latency kernel is the "aproximate solution" which is less expensive
aproximate = does not try to get down to 10-50usec latencies (HW limits),
plus no one is forced to supply a written guarantee that the latencies will
never be bigger than X msecs.
if you wish you can call lowlatency = soft-realtime, where empirical tests under
extreme conditions have shown to not exceed 2ms on Pentium+ hardware.
I think most multimedia people are happy with the above definition,
since not even BeOS claims to be realtime but it's a so called "Media OS".
Benno.
