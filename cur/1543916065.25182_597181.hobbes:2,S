A user can already create a device with fuse implicitly.  This patch
would just allow that explicitly.
Take this example: I've loopback mounted an UML disk image using fuse
(no privileges required), and want to create some device nodes.  I
can't yet boot the UML because the device node is missing from the
image.  So what should I do.  Currently I have to manipulate the
mounted image as root.  But that's really shouldn't be needed.

I don't want that either, and it has nothing to do with this patch.
