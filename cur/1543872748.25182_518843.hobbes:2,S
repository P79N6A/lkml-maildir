Con,
Recent kernel versions have real problems for me on the interactivity front,
with even a simple 'make' of my C++ program (PowerDNS) causing Firefox to
slow down to a crawl.
RSDL fixed all that, the system is noticeably snappier.
As a case in point, I used to notice when a compile was done because the
system stopped being sluggish.
Today, a few times, I only noticed 'make' was done because the fans of my
computer slowed down.
Thanks for the good work! I'm on 2.6.21-rc3-rsdl-0.29.
	Bert
