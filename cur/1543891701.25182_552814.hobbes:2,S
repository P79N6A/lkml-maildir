What users can do is something like this:
  chdir("some/long/path");
  chdir("some/even/longer/path");
  ...
and the total length of the path can then exceed PATH_MAX characters. We can 
only accept pathnames up to some upper limit, and we need to somehow define 
what that limit is supposed to be. We could use PATH_MAX or some other 
arbitrary number. In most situations PATH_MAX will be fine, but that's not 
always guaranteed to be the case. So what's wrong about making this 
configurable for special situations that we might run into? Module parameters 
are *really* dead cheap.
