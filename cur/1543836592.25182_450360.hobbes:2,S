Not really :-/
Whilst it's mentioned that the git-cpufreq.patch that was in -mm
made this happen, I really don't see anything in what you merged
yesterday that could explain any of this.
99% of the changes were to longhaul, so we can ignore those,
leaving just:
[CPUFREQ] return error when failing to set minfreq
Looks benign.
[CPUFREQ] Propagate acpi_processor_preregister_performance return value.
Shouldn't affect anything wrt hotplug
[CPUFREQ] [1/2] add __find_governor helper and clean up some error handling.
[CPUFREQ] [2/2] demand load governor modules.
Looks harmless to me, and those new functions don't show up
in any of those functions.
So I'm at a loss to explain why this made this bug suddenly appear, but
I don't think this is anything new.   Fixing it however...
I'm looking at it, but I don't see anything obvious yet.
