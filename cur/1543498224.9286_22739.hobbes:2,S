devfs is about "put the names where the crap is".
It happens that most of the crap, currently, is in the kernel.
Your XF86 and gpm examples do the same thing but in user space: they
create named pipes when they are loaded.
devfs is equally compatible with either scheme.
(I have no pro- or anti-devfs preference BTW).
