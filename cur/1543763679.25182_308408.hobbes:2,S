Here is a cite from RFC-1951 (page 4):
    A compressed data set consists of a series of blocks, corresponding
    to successive blocks of input data.  The block sizes are arbitrary,
    except that non-compressible blocks are limited to 65,535 bytes.
Thus,
1. 64K is only applied to non-compressible data, in which case zlib just 
copies it as it is, adding a 1-byte header and a 1-byte EOB marker.
2. 64K is just the *upper limit*, and blocks may be shorter.
3. If zlib compressed data (i.e., applied LZ77 & Huffman), blocks may 
have arbitrary length.
So, I don't see any reason why I can't.
