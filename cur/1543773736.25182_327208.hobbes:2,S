Check the linux-pcmcia list, check -mm and you'll see that the PCMCIA layer
is in the process of being updated.

Well, some of them are handled in the background, some are simply unsolvable
(no real reason for hardware to behave the way it does, no driver support,
extremely strange setups, ...), some bugs are caused elsewhere (e.g., in
current -mm, PCI makes life difficult for PCMCIA), and some bugs are not
handled at all because the few developers taking care of PCMCIA do have too
few time. So, some help in maintaining PCMCIA is much appreciated.
