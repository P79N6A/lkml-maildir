So the user-space interface would be part of the generic GPIO
infrastructure? I like the idea.

Much clearer now, thanks. I know what a latch is, I just couldn't get
how latching (or lack thereof) was related with an initial register
value. With the explanation above, I get it.

We apply the alphabetical order to driver names, not configuration
symbols, as far as I know. Though for most directories it probably
doesn't make a difference; drivers/i2c/chips is admittedly a bit messy
in this respect.
Note that at some point I will attempt to get rid of the "SENSORS" part
of configuration options that have nothing to do with sensors, that
should help a bit.

But most i2c chip drivers don't need a header file. Or is this going to
change with the new-style i2c drivers?
Along the same line, I am wondering if it would make sense to put the
various GPIO drivers in drivers/gpio. It's a much better practice to
group the drivers according to the functionality they provide than the
way they are connected to the system. drivers/i2c/chips is an exception
in this respect, it's meant for i2c drivers that have no obvious place
to live in. That's why there aren't many drivers there, and I hope it
will stay this way. In an ideal world we could even get rid of this
directory and move the remaining drivers to drivers/misc.

Ah, right, sorry for missing that. I had only looked at the parameters
and forgot the return type.

Only two copies in the version you posted, but indeed there would be
three if the trick was applied consistently.
