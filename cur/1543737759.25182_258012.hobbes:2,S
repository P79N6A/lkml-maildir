I'd be inclined to turn this sideways from what you say.
Rather, add another couple of properties to cpusets:
 1) An isolated flag, that guarantees whatever isolation properties
    we agree that schedulers, allocators and resource allocators
    require between domains, and
 2) For those cpusets which are so isolated, the option to add
    links of some form, between that cpuset, and distinct scheduler,
    allocator and/or resource domains.
