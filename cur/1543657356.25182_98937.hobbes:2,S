I disagree.  Negative tab indentation (where you start off on the right
hand side of the screen and tab or space towards the left) is obviously
the most natural form.  We should all be using it - it'll make the kernel
source _lots_ more readable.  In fact, I'll start converting the kernel
sources now.  ;-)
