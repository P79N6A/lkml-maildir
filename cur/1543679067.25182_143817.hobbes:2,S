David, your method is the dream of every software developer. Having Q/A
repeatedly pushing the same issue. Having a track is good and flagging a
report as not-a-bug or need-more-info takes almost the same time (if the
system is sanely designed) it takes you to flag your message a shit. In
this way though you do not lose things meaningful that you overlooked at
first sight. And this comes from someone that wanted to quit his job when
they forced for the first time to use a tracking system ;)
