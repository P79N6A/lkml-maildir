Modular?  If yes, try rmmod ide-scsi.  I am still getting the exact same 
oops and hang I got in:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=103351991417181&w=2
To summarize:  If I load ide-scsi on boot and don't remove any components 
while up I don't have a problem.  If I rmmod and ide-scsi related module I 
get an oops with apparent register poisoning (signature 5a5a5a5a in the 
register).  After one of these oops I get a hang on shutdown.  The oops 
and hang I get in 2.5.42 is exactly the same as that in the cited message.
