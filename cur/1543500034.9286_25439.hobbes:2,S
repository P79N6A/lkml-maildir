It's a rack PC with the CPUs and basic I/O stuff (keyboard, mouse
etc.) on a card. I'm not sure of the make or model. 2 x PII 266, 128
MB of memory and a 4.3 GB SCSI disk. I can try to provide more details 
if there are any specific things to check.

Yes, I am sure. The same kernel boots fine if I have a keyboard
connected to the box. 
As an extra point I could mention the fact that the floppy drive light 
stays lit when the machine hangs. Don't know if this is of any
significance.
