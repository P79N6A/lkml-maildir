If you read the archives 
http://lists.suse.com/archives/linux-usb/
you'll see this discussed in August and September. To fix it the
uhci driver needs to ignore other drivers' interrupts, and the
keyboard driver needs to handle non 0 status packets. Patch to
uhci was posted in:
http://lists.suse.com/archives/linux-usb/1999-Sep/0030.html
and the suggestion for the keyboard fix (not implemented, since I
don't have one) was in:
http://lists.suse.com/archives/linux-usb/1999-Sep/0004.html

no reply yet).

Works for me in 2.3.15 and 2.3.16 preferably with the above patch.

Don't know about that.

It isn't closed. In fact it seems impossible to subscribe to. I've sent
4 or 5 requests and received no replies, so I read it via the archives
and post to it without subscribing.
