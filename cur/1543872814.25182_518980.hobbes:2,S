No need for `Description:'. This line is automatically put in the logs 
as a patch description if the patch got accepted. 
It's better not to use very large lines. 
Also there's no need to specify the exact function in the log, it's already
displayed in the patch.

As said in Documentation/SubmittingPatches put a "---" line after
Signed-off-by signature.
