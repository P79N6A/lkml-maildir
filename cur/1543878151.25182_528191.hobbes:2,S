Please change your coding style to conform to Documentation/CodingStyle.
	***	Only indent with tabs!!		***
Every one of those examples violates that simple rule.
Why does *anyone* have even the slightest difficulty understanding such a
simple rule?  I realize that two of those words have more than a single
syllable, but that should not be a problem.  Even EMACS is trainable.

Better yet, try to stick to its guidelines rather than growing lots of
exceptions saying when your personal style says you ought to use spaces
instead of tabs for indents, etc
Randy, next time you criticise coding style, please make sure that the
code in question actually violates the existing rules first ... this
thread has been way too much noise, given that the usage you criticized
was in full conformance with that document, and the proposed fixes were
in blatant violation ...
