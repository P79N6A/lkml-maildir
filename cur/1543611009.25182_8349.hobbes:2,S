You have to alias sound-slot-0 and/or sound-service-0-0 to the correct
module.
"man modules.conf" will propably tell you more

Propably you just block the console messages *after* boot. I suspect there
is already a kernel parameter to set this though, so you don't need to mess
with the source. Browse a bit in "Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt"
(hint: try appending "quiet=1" when you boot your kernel)
