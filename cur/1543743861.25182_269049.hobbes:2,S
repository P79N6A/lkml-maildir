Hi kernel folks,
I just enter this bug because I want to buy a new laptop and very often
there's only USB 2.0 port on new ones...
Quickly my problem :
I try to mount as a usb-storage my Minolta DiMAGE F200 (which seems to
be USB
1.1)  on a kernel 2.6
If I plug it on a USB 2.0 plug, it hangs
If I plug it on a USB 1.1 plug, it works
With kernel 2.4 (module usb-uhci) it works whatever the plug I use.
I've posted more information there :
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3711
If there's a patch around or something that I can test, ask.
Thanks for your job.
PS : Please cc me as I'm not on the list
