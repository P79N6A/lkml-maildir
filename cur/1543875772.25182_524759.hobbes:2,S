You don't have to do them all -- you could do one with (as in my 
previous patch -- which I'm not married to BTW ;) )
touch_cpu_softlockup_watchdog()
and all with
touch_softlockup_watchdog()

But wouldn't a call to touch_[cpu_]softlockup_watchdog at the end of the 
flash update fix the problem?  And ditto for all other areas of the
