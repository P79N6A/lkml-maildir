Ok, this one is more complex than my suggested one-liner, but seems to fix 
another bug. And it's logic in dequeue_signal() is a bit prettier than 
Ben's (otherwise somewhat similar) patch.
HOWEVER: I'm still a bit worried about the fact that we have about ~180 
calls to "recalc_sigpending()" around the kernel, and I'm not AT ALL sure 
that they are all supposed to possibly clear the TIF_SIGPENDING flag. The 
fact that we had basically two independent bugs in this area really makes 
me more convinced that we probably should clear TIF_SIGPENDING in the only 
path that really matters, namely the one that _depends_ on it being right 
(the "do_signal()" path).
So I think that the *right* place to clear TIF_SIGPENDING is actually in 
"get_signal_to_deliver()", because that function is called _only_ by the 
actual per-architecture "I'm going to deliver a signal now".
(Oh, and we do need to handle it in the "notifier()" case too - ugly hack 
for DRM).
So how does *this* patch look? It:
 - totally removes the "clear_tsk_thread_flag()" from the signal pending 
   recalculations (ie now both "recalc_sigpending()" _and_ 
   "recalc_sigpending_tsk()" will ever only _set_ that bit)
 - in get_signal_to_deliver(), it adds a
	if (!recalc_sigpending_tsk(current))
		d_flag(TIF_SIGPENDING);
   at the end.
 - it removes the "recalc_sigpending_tsk()" from dequeue_signal(), since 
   that can never clear the signal any more.
So now we should do "recalc_sigpending()" only when signals may be *added* 
(where messing with the "blocked" mask obviously is a form of adding 
signals, and possibly the most common reason for having to recalculate the 
sigpending mask).
Comments? This patch is _entirely_ and utterly untested, so I'm only 
saying that this "feels" safer and more correct to me.
