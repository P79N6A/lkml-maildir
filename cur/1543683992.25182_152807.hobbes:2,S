In order to isolate problems, the fewer patches there are between releases,
the easier it will be to find out what can be the cause of the problem
(if any, the last couple of pre releases are working perfectly for me,
 if CONFIG_VIDEO_BT848 would be saved in .config, I can build them
 without human intervention, so the number of releases is no problem for
 me. When the compile succeeds, the next time I boot my machine I will have
 the latest kernel running, currently 2.4.22-pre9).
