Subject: [PATCH 01/41] m68k: compile fix - hardirq checks were in wrong place
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

move the sanity check for NR_IRQS being no more than 1<<HARDIRQ_BITS
from asm-m68k/hardirq.h to asm-m68k/irq.h; needed since NR_IRQS is
not necessary know at the points of inclusion of asm/hardirq.h due
to the rather ugly header dependencies on m68k.  Fix is by far simpler
than trying to massage those dependencies...
