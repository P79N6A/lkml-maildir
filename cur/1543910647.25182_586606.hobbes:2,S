Side note: I think we migth want to also have some way of telling the user 
*why* we're not doing frequency changes. Maybe as simple as a rate-limited 
printk() or something.
Otherwise, we'll easily be in a situation where some poor sod ends up 
running constantly at lowest frequency, and no way of even seeing why. 
Which sounds like a debugging nightmare.
If the kernel spits out the occasional warning about the latency 
violation, at least we get notified about there being potential problems.
