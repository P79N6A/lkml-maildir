Oh, then the end has already arrived. Linux already allows binary
modules. 
They have to be compiled for your kernel release though. But there is
no rule that this has to be done by you. Look at the ltmodem.o module
from Lucent (which does not run on my Acer 710TE Laptop :-( ).
It depends on the user whether to load a module or not. Not on the
vendor.
