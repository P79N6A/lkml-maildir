2.3.7 is a kernel-developers-only release. 2.3.7 will corrupt your data. 
Be happy you dont run 2.3.7. We are working hard on fixing bugs, but at
this point it just makes no sense to add more filesystems to the list of
potentially hosed filesystems. Being a programmer yourself i hope you
understand that thinking. If you take the risk and run development kernels
we'd be very happy to see bug reports and patches from you. [eg. for the
known FAT breakage]
