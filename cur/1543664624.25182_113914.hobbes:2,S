That problem has been around for a while. I reported it for 2.5.59 which
just happened to be the first 2.5 kernel I tested with swsuspend.
I'm seeing the bug every time I try swsuspend on 2.5. The same Vanilla
kernels seem to work for other people, though.
The only thing that came up at the time was a suggestion to replace BUG_ON
with while (which I didn't try because I'd like to keep my data).
