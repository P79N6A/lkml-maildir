Hi.  I recently built 2.6.9-bk7.  Everything works as 2.6.9 except for
my TV tuner card (which needs a bt878 driver).  The problem is that
there is no bt878 driver.  There was one in 2.6.9-bk3 which worked (3
days ago!!!).  Where did the driver go?  There doesn't seem to be '878
support in "make menuconfig" either.  Was support for bt878 tv tuner
cards dropped from the kernel?
(To contact me you will have to mail me as I'm not on the list)
Thanks,
Bob
