I don't know why you write that, and then say thanks.  Clearly, what you 
wrote originally, and what Andreas pointed out, were quite obvious 
indicators that git already does what you suggest.
You _do_ work "transparently" (whatever you understand by that overused 
term) in the working directory, unimpeded by git.
And whenever it is time to revert or commit, you cry for help, invoking 
git.
So either you succeeded in making yourself misunderstood, or Andreas had 
quite the obvious and correct comment for you.
Not that diffcult,
