I had PCI-clipping tests on our servers.
On injected error, I confirmed that some of them actually
asserts NMI with the reason bit, and logs PCI parity error
to its SEL. (And rests, some having old chipsets, also logs
to SEL but asserts NMI with no reason bits, aka unknown NMI.)
Yes, it's true that not all server support the NMI reporting.

I'm not sure but there could be a special card and card driver
that triggers such NMI but can handle/recover the error.
Also I'm not sure why linux had not have "nmi_panic" but only
"unknown_nmi_panic" that have no effects on reasoned NMI.

Frankly, this is a kind of port from RHEL3.
Maybe as you know, RHEL3 has "mem_nmi_panic" sysctl.
Of course it is useful for me. That's why the patch is here.
I agree that some server will require this on by default.
However this will not be work with oprofile, and I think this is
not the time to concrete NMI handling.
So now mem_nmi_panic I suggest is just duplicated one of existing
unknown_nmi_panic.
