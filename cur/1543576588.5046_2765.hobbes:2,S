I was able to patch and build 2.4.0test13pre4-ac2.  I did not see the problem
with smp.c which existed with the earlier test13pre3-ac3.

I did things in this order:
tar zxvf linux-2.4.0-test12.tar.gz 
patch -p0 <test13-pre4
cd linux
patch -p1 <patch-2.4.0test13pre4-ac2
Found problem with build, fixed it, submitted patch.
cd /usr/src
patch -p0 <linux-2.4.0-test12-reiserfs-3.6.23-patch
patch -p0 <reiserfs-Makefile-patch
I then built a kernel with reiserfs-3.6.23 which I'm running now.
