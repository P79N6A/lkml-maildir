Subject: 2.4.0 hangs with PIII i815e system

Hello.
I don't know whom should i post this bug, so i post it here, hopefully
someone will pick it up:)
I'm currently running an old P166 16MB machine, running kernel 2.4.0
smoothly, with 15 days uptime till now.
Recently, i got a new and shiny PIII 700Mhz, 64MB box, with Intel
motherboard based on the i815e chipset, with intergrated
NIC/Audio/Graphic.
I installed Suse 7.0, where LVM was used on all filesystems except boot
and root, and ReiserFS was used with one volume, to be used with Squid.
The machine ran smoothly with the supplied 2.2.16 kernel, yet i decided
to upgrade to 2.4.0.
But since upgrading to 2.4.0, i have random, unexpected lock-ups, and that
means TOTAL lock-up, no console switching, no SysRQ key, nothing responds.
I first tried removing all of the(probably troublemaking) i81x features,
ICH2 audio driver, DRI and AGP were all moved out of the kernel, yet
lockups still occour.
If i can point at a common cause, all these lock-ups except one occoured
while downloading something, and in all cases squid 2.2. was running.
I include the kernel config file, and kernel bootup messages,hopefully, it
will help debugging the problem
