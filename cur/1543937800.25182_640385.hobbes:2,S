The VFS does not fully handle ESTALE.  An ESTALE error can occur
during the second pathname resolution attempt.  There are lots of
reasons, some of which are the 1 second resolution from some file
systems on the server and the window in between the revalidation
and the actual use of the file handle associated with each
dentry/inode pair.
Also, there was no support for ESTALE errors which occur during
subsequent operations to the pathname resolution process.  For
example, during a mkdir(2) operation, the ESTALE can occur from
the over the wire MKDIR operation after the LOOKUP operations
have all succeeded.
    Thanx...
