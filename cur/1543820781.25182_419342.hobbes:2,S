It's noise and _much work.
So in the end, we are removing the current kfree() and replacing them 
with one kfree_can_be_null() and one kfree_cannot_be_null()
(one of them might continue to be called kfree())?
Keeping kfree() as it is today has the advantages:
- smallest code
- noone can forget the NULL check
- KISS
Do you have any benchmarks where your approach brings a measurable 
benefit? I wouldn't have expected kfree() being in many hotpaths.
