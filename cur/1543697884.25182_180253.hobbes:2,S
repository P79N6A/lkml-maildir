Well, I would only aim at x86, with generic code for the
rest of the architectures.  The truth is, I'm sure others would
be better/faster at it than me, but we keep discussing it, and it
never gets done, so unless someone beats me to it, I'll take a stab
at it...  Might be after Christmas though, busy December coming up!
I agree with your approach below.  One thing I was thinking about:
is it possible that two threads ask for the timestamp of a single skb
concurrently?  If so, we may need a lock if we want to cache the conversion
to gettimeofday units....  Of course, the case where multiple readers want
the timestamp for a single skb may be too rare to warrant caching...
