The patch for 2.4 in
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/scalable-timers-patches/
does not acquire net_bh_lock. Then I suppose it does not apply to that ?
So this patch is a little outdated wrt the one for 2.5. Is there any
updated version available for 2.4 ?
Can I try your patch for 2.5 on 2.4 or is there any infrastructure
missing ?
TIA
