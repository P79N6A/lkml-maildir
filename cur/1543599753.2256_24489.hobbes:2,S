With infinite-precision arithmetic, yes; of course min() should just
return the smaller value.
But what would the C type of "min" be for comparing, say, signed and
unsigned longs?  The range of possible results does not fit in any
integral type.  (Repeat the question for signed/unsigned "long long"
if "long long" is your answer.)
