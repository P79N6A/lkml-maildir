Hi,
We're using a pentium based PC with hercules monochrome monitor&card at
home running Linux. The main disadvantage of this combination is the missing
scroll back function. Since hercules is an ISA card there're also problems
with scolling VTs (produces strange noise when playing something through
an isa based sound card). BUT hercules supports hardware scrolling as wall
as VGA. drivers/video/vgacon.c can handle MDA console as well but it doesn't
know anything about hercules. So first I must detect hercules. Then I realized
that in mdacon.c there're the right routines ! And NOW, what's up ?
Should I put the SAME code into vgacon.c which is existed in mdacon.c  ?
The best thing would be separated mda and vga console code but it has
got one big disadvantage : kernel compiled to VGA console won't run
on hercules and vice versa. I think there should be a cleaning about
mda & vga console handling ... Also interesing things about dual heading
system (VGA/Hercules). Maybe we should have only ONE driver for mda (and
hercules too) / VGA with capability to handle multiple output (like VGA
and MDA) ?
Now, I tried to implement hardware scrolling for hercules in vgacon.c
but it does not work very well :(
Another question : is there way to reduce the effect to sound playing of
hercules displaying (for example using XF86_MONO ...) or this is the effect
of the famous "excellent" PC architecture ?
