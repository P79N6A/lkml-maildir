OK, I'm still having this problem with 2.3.22.  Here's the error which
repeats many, many times before the system finally just hangs.
APIC error interrupt on CPU#0, should never happen.
... APIC ESR0: 00000004
... APIC ESR1: 00000004
APIC error interrupt on CPU#12, should never happen.
... APIC ESR0: 00000008
... APIC ESR1: 00000008
I copied this down on a piece of paper so it might now be 100%
correct.
   Any ideas?
   Thanks,
   Rick Niles.
