I have not yet sure how invisible mount can be used to solve the FUSE
problem.  
Again my understanding of the basic requirement of FUSE is:
1. A user being able to setup his own VFS-mount environment which
  	 is only visible to the user. 
2. The same user being able to see exactly the same VFS-mount  
	environment from any login session.
