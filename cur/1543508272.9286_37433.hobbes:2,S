While we're whinging about 2.3.17pre1: The PCMCIA code appears to contain a 
large amount of code which is not PCMCIA-specific at all, but is instead 
related to handling memory devices.
I'm working on a generic system for handling memory devices, which is based on 
David Hinds' code, but separate from the PCMCIA system - many embedded systems 
use memory devices which aren't PCMCIA-based.
