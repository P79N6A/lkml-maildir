Ahh, I'm going to kick my head on the table...
Well, lets begin again. So:
- for 2.4, use ide-scsi
- for 2.6, use ATA
So cdrecord should stop to scan the ATAPI pseudo bus.
My problem is just that I want to set an easy way to burn for users.
In other systems you just hav an app onto you throw your mp3 and get 
an audio disc, or d'n'd your files and get a cd.
And I don want to tell people to rune mkisofs with a ton of options
(jolliet, rr, long names, etc...). So they must use a GUI tool.
The best I like nowadays is gnomebaker.
The thing is that all frontends use cdrecord. In many you can't specify
the device by hand, they just give you a menu based on cdrecord -scan
output. They should tell cdrecord to scan SCSI and ATA buses, but not ATAPI.
And now, as root:
werewolf:~# cdrecord dev=ATA -scanbus
...

(pam did it for the console ;))
There are some bugs here:
- One in cdrecord, that exits as soon as it can't open a device, instead
  of trying till it gets the cdwriter.
- Other in cdrecord, the system does not behave the same way if I
  give /dev/hdc or ATA:1,0,0.
- Other in the kernel, that does not allow to query capabilities of the
  drive to a normal user.
I can hackpatch cdrecord, but have no idea of what to do with the kernel.
I remember there were some mails time ago about adding allowed commands to
cdrom/cdwiters, but can't find them.
Perhaps, someday, somwhere, I could burn a disc in Linux as plain user.
Thanks for bearing me...
