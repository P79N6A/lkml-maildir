Yes. locking and error handling desperately needs a re-write, especially
keeping AIO in mind. I would love to see "kicking back to buffered mode"
completely go away. If Ken and Zach are willing to provide help on
looking over & testing error handling cases (with pulling drives :)), 
I have no problem with re-write :)
