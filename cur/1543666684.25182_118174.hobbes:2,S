What I said has been misinterpreted. Select takes the highest
number fd in the set you want to examine plus 1. It therefore
requires some relationship to the fd that you are using if
you are using a socket whos value was N you must select on
(at least) N+1, not the return value of a function that gives
the maximum number of fds that you can open. They are not the
same and are not guaranteed to be related although on some
target, they might. It's the same problem as:
	write(1, "Hello\n", 6);
Such code is broken. At the very least, one needs to use
STDOUT_FILENO as the fd, and really should not count characters
by hand.
