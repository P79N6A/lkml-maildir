Subject: [RFC][PATCH 11/11] security: AppArmor - Export namespace semaphore
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch exports the namespace_sem semaphore.
The shared subtree patches which went into 2.6.15-rc1 replaced the old
namespace semaphore which used to be per namespace (and visible) with a
new single static semaphore.
The reason for this change is that currently visibility of vfsmount information
to the LSM hooks is fairly patchy.  Either there is no passed parameter or
it can be NULL.  For the case of the former,  several LSM hooks that we
require to mediate have no vfsmount/nameidata passed.  We previously (mis)used
the visibility of the old per namespace semaphore to walk the processes 
namespace looking for vfsmounts with a root dentry matching the dentry we were 
trying to mediate.  
Clearly this is not viable long term strategy and changes working towards 
passing a vfsmount to all relevant LSM hooks would seem necessary (and also 
useful for other users of LSM). Alternative suggestions and ideas are welcomed.
