Hi,
-rc8 with "Old hard disk (MFM/RLL/IDE) driver" still doesn't build.
Does it mean that the old ide driver will not be available anymore and
that 2.4.21 will not run on some older computers ? 
Using the new driver will not help on some older computers. I gave it a
try, and at least one of my computers have serious timing problems with
the new (enhanced) ide driver.
I try again to send a (trivial) patch to fix this. Please, Marcello,
consider including it. Anyway, it can't break anything.
If you reject it, please give me a chance to improve it, and tell me
why.
