For the case of cifs (and nfs and afs) the "fs" is part of the name of 
the protocol ("common internet file system [protocol]") but for the 
other filesystems I agree that it seems redundant to put "fs" in the 
name (with a few exceptions e.g. "GFS2" would sound strange if named 
"G2" or "global2", and OCFS2 is presumably a product name).
