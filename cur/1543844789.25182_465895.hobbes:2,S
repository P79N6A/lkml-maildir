Thanks for the pointer - we will have a look.

But then all the driver developers need to remember if a register is 16 or 
32 bits. Blackfin peripherals mix and match, depending on what the silicon 
designer decided what good at the time. (which means if it fits in 16 bits, 
it is a 16-bit register).
I guess we are all lazy, and don't want to have to go through the 
complexity of looking up each register when we use it in a driver.
calling bfin_read_PLL_CTL() which is defined and typecast properly as short 
bfin_read16(PLL_CTL), ensure we resolve issues like this at compile time, 
without having to keep the manual in front of us.
