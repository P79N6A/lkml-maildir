Quite easy to say. I don't really understeand all changes that 've been 
done over mm between 2.6.6-rc2-bk2 and 2.6.5.
But from my tests today, it looks like processes locked (?) in kernel 
are not getting freezed.
Simple example. Mount something over nfs, than disconnect your network 
cable, and inside that dir run ls.
Kernel will not be able to freeze bash !!, obvioulsy bug. I'll try to 
investigate it my self, but if someone can get with fast explanation, to 
enlight me problem, that would be nice.
Nfs is maybe a tougth example. Try i.e. dd bs=1 (to make it slower) 
if=/proc/kmem of=/dev/null,
or even open mc, and press F3 on /proc/kmem, providing that your 
machines is slow.  At that point, MC on my computer eats about  900MB of 
swap ! (I  have only 128MB of ram, so it's quite strange). Anyways,
echo "4" >/proc/acpi/sleep, and kernel will not be able to freeze it.
