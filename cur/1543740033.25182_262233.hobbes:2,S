I should actually read mails befor replying ;)  I thought the bug was in
lnstat - but apparently it wasn't.
The include bug seems non-trivial to fix. (how do I hate kernel include
from userspace issues):
apparently __KERNEL_STRICT_NAMES is definde somewhere (glibc?) which
prevents __le16, __le64 and others from being defined in linux/types.h.
Just reietting it like this doesn't help much:
diff -Nru iproute2-2.6.9-041019/ip/iptunnel.c iproute2-2.6.9-laf/ip/iptunnel.c

Since now we have conflicting definitions

I'm done with this, maybe somebody with more clue about kernel include
magic will take on from this.
Additional issue:  the iproute2 makefile didn't stop the build process
in the event of an error.   Stephen, plase consider this patch to fix
it:
