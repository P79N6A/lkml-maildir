It should still take an appreciable amount of time surely?  We can
detect those wraps in userspace and deal with it as needed.

It comes up from time to time (see below).

ifconfig is userspace.

I thought the concensurs here was that because doing reliable atomic
updates of 64-bit values isn't possible on some (most?) 32-bit
architectures so we need additional locking to make this work which is
undesirable?  (It might even be a FAQ by now as this comes up fairly
often).
