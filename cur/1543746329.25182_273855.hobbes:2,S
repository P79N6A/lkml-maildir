I don't understand this. You seem to be assuming that everyone who
compiles this will be compiling it with the GPL version of the RCU code.
It seems to me that only the resulting object file must be licensed
under the GPL because of the fact it uses other GPL-only code (the RCU
code in the kernel)
As a standalone piece of code, wouldn't it be freely licensed however
the author wishes?

Maybe it's the fact that you're being vague that is leading to my
confusion.

Or compile against non-GPL RCU code, right?

I don't mean to be nitpicking here, but I'm trying to figure out why you
interpreted the GPL like you did. I'd be venturing to guess that pretty
much everyone will be compiling against the GPL-only RCU code.
Just because the possibility exists that code can be compiled against
GPL-only code, doesn't necessarily mean that it too requires a GPL-only
license.
It seems like pretty much any code would fall into that category.
