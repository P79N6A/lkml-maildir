Subject: Intel eepro100 ISA won't load

Trying to get the NIC loaded with module eepro, but insmod complains 'device or
resource busy'. Also tried eepro100, though I know it's for PCI devices...
Checked for overlap on IRQ's and IO, seems ok; set it up with I/O 0x200, IRQ 10.
RH 5.2/2.0.36 on a Nx586 VLB - pretty uncommon, but runs Linux fine. 3com 509
loads with no problems, same with Buslogic BT445S SCSI on I/O 340, IRQ 11.
I'm not currently on the kernel list (shame on me), so mail me privately.
Thanks in advance,
