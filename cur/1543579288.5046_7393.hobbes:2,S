Does anyone know of a driver for the Crystal 4299 sound chip?
I grepped through /drivers/sound in both 2.2.18 and 2.4.0. 
The only hints were that "ac97_codec.c" has two codec id's listed for it.
From old changelogs I see that Mulder Tjeerd was involved in adding those...
perhaps he is writing a driver?  
Any hints would be appreciated.
