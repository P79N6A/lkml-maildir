[PATCH] add printing of udev version to scripts/ver_linux
Since udev is starting to be used a lot of places and I've seen people get
asked about their udev version a few times on lkml I figured it was
perhaps time that scripts/ver_linux reported this info so it would get
into more bugreports by default.
This patch adds printing of udev version to scripts/ver_linux
