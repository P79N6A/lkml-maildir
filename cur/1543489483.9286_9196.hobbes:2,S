   Woops Dave, now I think I am been wrong again in my comments about Greg's
   change. The reason there wasn't FIN on the wire is exactly because the
   FIN is shifted in the second packet. I did understood fine how
   tcp_fragment() works but I overlooked something again with the
   solution under my eyes. Ok, I'll have a good break now...
   I think a better (faster) patch could looks like this (the second line
   change is just a little improvement):
Nice work, this is certainly it.  I'll test this a bit and send it off
to Linus...
BTW, the code was correct when I first wrote it, the "-= nsize" was an
optimization meant to decrease the number of local variables live in
that section of code (for the benefit of gcc's register
allocator)... Oh well.. :-)
