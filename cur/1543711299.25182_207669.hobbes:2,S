There have been arguments about exactly what a node is since there has
been a concept of a node at all.  In the kernel, it isn't defined.  A
node doesn't *have* to have CPUs on it (see nr_cpus_node()), doesn't
*have* to have memory, doesn't *have* to have I/O.  It's supposed to be
just a container for those 3 things, but the containers can be empty. 
This code doesn't get into what a node is, just makes sure they're used
properly... ;)

Yep...  I saw both numnodes and numionodes perusing the ia64 code.  You
should be able to put these CPU/memless nodes in the node_online_map
now...  If there's code that's assuming a node contains either CPUs or
memory, I'd like to find it! :)

Super.  I'd really like feedback on the ia64 code (well, actually all
the non-i386 code).  I did what I thought was right, but eyes more
familiar with the code are extremely welcome.
Cheers!
