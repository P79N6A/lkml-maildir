I'm not sure where I am in the pecking order, although there are some
security issues (I didn't cc you on that patch, doh). So the patches
are against mainline to give the option of merging them earlier.
All the patches except 17/18 are standalone, however. So if any of them
don't apply for Andrew, I can do another pass to catch the remainders.
I'll definitely help you with the new drm VM one way or the other ;)
