Could you send the text of the new boot up sequence?  What is the failure, 
hang or crash?  There are several potential causes of the problem:
1) The eagle is 486 (or pentium with external local apic based)  The code to 
handle this cause could be causing grief
2) There's special code to detect the IO-APIC and re-route the interrupts in 
physical mode, is this getting triggered?
