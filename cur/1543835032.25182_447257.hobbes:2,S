The ThinkPad ACPI tables do list the relevant IO ports (0x1600-0x161F)
as reserved, but provide no way to discern what's behind them. Other
machines have different hardware on the same ports.
BTW, I should clarify that this embedded controller interface (used by
hdaps and tp_smapi) is different than the standard ACPI EC interface,
and goes through different IO ports.

This is unrealistic. The hdaps and tp_smapi drivers support dozens of
ThinkPad models, each with a different BIOS.
For the tp_smapi driver, AFAIK the only completely safe alternative to
this patch is a frequently-updated whitelist of over a hundred models,
identified by the existing DMI attributes.
