Check!

Looks like it, from the info for make. AFAIR, it has been there the better
part of forever. In "GNU make", under "Special Targets" one finds:
`.PRECIOUS'
     The targets which `.PRECIOUS' depends on are given the following
     special treatment: if `make' is killed or interrupted during the
     execution of their commands, the target is not deleted.  *Note
     Interrupting or Killing `make': Interrupts.  Also, if the target
     is an intermediate file, it will not be deleted after it is no
     longer needed, as is normally done.  *Note Chains of Implicit
     Rules: Chained Rules.
