Wrong. Without this Andreas' patch, he'll get access to your
half-a-year-old GPG passphrases, too.

What I'm worried is: attacker steals your laptop after you were using
swsusp for half a year. Now your swap partition contains random pieces
of GPG keys you were using for last half a year. That's bad.
Current GPG keys can be found in RAM; unfortunately your swap
partition can contain current and old GPG keys that were never
supposed to be on disk. That's bad and I think we can agree on
that. Andreas's patch solves it; if it was not supposed to go on disk,
it will be erased after you resume. You can not do much better.
It is equivalent of clearing swsusp data from swap after resume, just
implemented somewhat clever...
