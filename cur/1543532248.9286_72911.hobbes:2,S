I'm sorry but this is uncalled for.  Some people are excessively crass
when they don't like something.  Having a completely magic /dev appears to
be perfectly acceptable to plenty of people.  It's a kernel option not a
requirement, let it be.  In point A you bespeak evil of hard coded things
and yet you want a hard coded template in point D.
As for point E, no.  Flat out no.  The current design of devfs is heavily
changed due to a lot of influence from Linus and related about how it should
be done.  And for inflicting it upon you, again it is an option you
certainly are not required to implement either in part or whole.  It is not
the perfect solution everyone wants but Linus has accepted it for the time
being.
