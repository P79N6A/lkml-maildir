Today, 3 CPUID leaves starting from 0x4000_0000 are defined in a generic
fashion (hypervisor detection, version, and hypercall page), and those
are the ones used by Xen today. We should extend those leaves (e.g.
starting from 0x4000_0003) for the vmm-independent features as well.
If Xen needs additional Xen-specific features, we need to allocate some
leaves for those (e.g. 0x4000_1000)
