I think it's superflous to increase the length of the sequence number
(ipc_perm.seq), it's limited to USHRT_MAX anyway [hard implementation
limit, difficult to increase]
You have increased all limits to 'long', ie 64-bit on 64-bit platforms.
Should we do that? If we increase them to 'long', then we should also
modify the sysctls and the internal variables: most of them are 'int'
values.
This is required because certain limits are writable: what if root tries
to increase the maximum message queue length to 0x1 0000 0000 L? I think
these "if(value > INT_MAX)" lines are ugly.
And: What about making xxx64 a bit flag (eg 256)? This could clean up
the code, especially if you replace
copy_to_user(src,dest,sizeof(msgid_ds)) with a special
copy_msgid_id_to_user(src,dest,version)' function.
