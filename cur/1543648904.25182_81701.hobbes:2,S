Subject: ACPI Toshiba-extras LCD backlight control not working anymore?

I can see the brightness levels:
  [eric@localhost eric]$ cat /proc/acpi/toshiba/lcd
  brightness:              5
  brightness_levels:       8
but I cannot change them.  Values echoed to the file are silently 
ignored.
This used to work many versions ago (maybe 2.5.25, I don't recall).  
It hasn't worked since 2.5.38, at least.  Anyone know what happened?
Eric
