I'm seeing almost the same problem.
When I configure pppd (version 2.3.11) to demand dial, I can bring up the
interface fine.  ifconfig shows the same settings for ppp0 as I saw with
2.2.14.  But when I make a request for data that would normally go out the
default route which under 2.2.14 would cause pppd to dial there is just a
pause and then the request fails.
At that point ifconfig shows that ppp0 is gone.  The only message I get in
my syslog is:
Mar 12 15:35:36 clubneon pppd[26106]: read: Bad file descriptor(9)
Without demand dialing pppd works fine.
