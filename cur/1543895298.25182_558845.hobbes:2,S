Suppose you have modified the patch as a result of a review and you post the
modified version.  Is that still right to put "Reviewed-by" into it?
Personally, I don't think so, because that suggests that this particular
version of the patch has been reviewed and not the previous one.

Yes, IMO in such a case it would be appropriate to do that.
Also, the review need not lead to any negative comments from the reviewer,
but in that case it's also appropriate to add a "Reviewed-by" to the patch.
Generally, if someone comments my patches, I add his/her address to the next
version's CC list, which sort of documents that the reviewer was involved.
Then, if the reviewer ACKs the patch, that will be recorded.
I think that for "Reviewed-by" to work correctly, we ought to have a two-stage
process of accepting patches, where in the first stage the patch is reviewed
and if there are no objections, the "Reviewed-by" (or "Acked-by") records are
added to it in the next stage (the patch itself remains unmodified).

First of all, the author should have a good understanding of what he's doing
and why.  If there are any doubts with respect to that, the patch is likely to
introduce bugs.
This also depends on who will be handling the bug reports related to the patch.
If that will be the patch author, then so be it. ;-)

Well, IMHO, the author of the patch should convince _you_ that the patch is
correct, not the other way around.  If you have doubts and make him think
twice of the code and he still can't prove his point, this means that he
doesn't understand what he's doing well enough.

Unless you are the poor soul having to handle bug reports related to the
problem.

I don't think that the education alone will be enough.  IMO we need to have a
system that promotes the reviewing of code.
