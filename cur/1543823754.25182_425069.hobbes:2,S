Are you kidding ??? Does the touchscreen support pressure sensitivity? 
Normally it wouldn't, you'd have only two values... Because sensitivity 
touchscreens really are rare... That's why wacom does use the pen to 
report pressure info on their tablets

I would say touchscreen calibration = scaling (to resolution) + 
reference points

I would say the best would be to watch pressure evolution.... If it 
springs from 0 to 400 in less than sotg like 200 ms, then you got the 
"button" event. Is it feasable?
I got a question: does stylus usage on original A780 show the pressure 
sensitivity?
Another one: you say you're workin on building X-e. Are you talking 
about kdrive?
