    At first glance, by the way, the only write barrier I see in the
    SCSI command set is the synchronize-cache command, which completes
    only after all the drive's dirty buffers are written out. Of
    course, without write caching, it's not an issue.
Is the spec you have distributable? I believe some of the early drafts
were, but the final spec isn't.
I'd really like to check it out myself, I alwasy assumed SCSI had the
smarts for write-barriers and force-unit-access but I guess I was
wrong.
Anyhow, I'd like to see the spec for myself if it is something I can
get hold of.
