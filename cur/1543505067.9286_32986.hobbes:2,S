<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Linux Kernel Community,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>We appreciate the patience of the Linux community 
with this project.&nbsp; We are happy to announce that we are now feature 
complete on the FENRIS NwFs Source Base and all of the final regression tests 
have been completed in all areas for the FENRIS Core.&nbsp; We will post release 
1.4.6 officially next week at ftp site 207.109.151.240.&nbsp; This release 
contains Volume Suballocation, RapidFATs, Extended Directory Support for OS2 and 
MAC, full Mirroring, Re-Mirroring, Read and Write Hotfixing, NetWare Directory 
Services Support (Databases), Striping, and Fault Tolerant Failover for 
mirror/duplex failures.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>This release still runs on Linux Stock Kernel 
2.0.37, however, it is a feature complete NetWare file system.&nbsp; We have 
also completed the ports to the Linux 2.2/2.3 VFS Architecture.&nbsp; The 2.2 
version is in system testing with (<A 
href="mailto:langus@timpanogas.com">langus@timpanogas.com</A>) for the next 
several weeks.&nbsp; Anyone needing a status on when stuff will be posted should 
contact Larry.&nbsp; He runs the release schedule (we will serve no wine before 
It's time).&nbsp; When these regression tests have run to completion, we will 
post this code base.&nbsp; We have deliberately withheld the utilities that 
create and manage NetWare file systems on Linux.&nbsp; This has been 
intentional.&nbsp; We have numerous licensees of FENRIS for&nbsp;projects other 
than Linux who have come to us with issues&nbsp;about our release of these 
utilities to the public.&nbsp; Most of the folks who&nbsp;license from us use 
the core file system&nbsp;library for SAN switches, disk-cloning products, 
etc.&nbsp; These licensees have voiced their concern that were we to open source 
the utilities that create and manage Netware file systems, that this would harm 
their businesses because it would allow other folks to get access to the 
technology without going through us for a license.&nbsp; TRG has NO contractural 
prohibition that would prevent us from open sourcing these tools.&nbsp; As such, 
we have decided that we will open source the tools, but will do so when the 
FENRIS project has been fully completed and integrated into the Linux 
core.&nbsp; This means that if Linus Torvalds and Alan Cox choose to roll NwFs 
into the Linux Core proper, then we will Open Source the tools for everyone to 
use.&nbsp; If they do not roll NwFs into the Linux Core, then we will provide 
everyone access to binary versions of the tools, but will not publish the source 
code.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The performance numbers for FENRIS on Linux are 
**POOR** in comparison to this IDENTICAL code base running under Windows NT 4.0 
and Windows 2000.&nbsp; Both run circles around&nbsp;Linux, even on Linux 2.3 by 
a factor of about 55%.&nbsp; We&nbsp;are&nbsp;attempting to figure 
out&nbsp;why.&nbsp; Ingo's Page Cache does really help get the performance up to 
the same levels as Windows NT in some scenarios, however, when the buffer cache 
get's heavily loaded, Linux seems to get into some serious trouble vs. NT and 
Netware.&nbsp; We are attempting to figure out why.&nbsp; The performance of 
FENRIS on Linux vs. Native Netware from our tests show that Netware is about 
240% faster than Linux running this identical code base.&nbsp; We created a 
VSWITCH plug-in (Novell's equivalent of an IFS)&nbsp;of FENRIS on Netware to 
compare our identical code base running unde Netware 4.x vs. Linux.&nbsp; 
Netware **KICKS** Linux's butt.&nbsp;&nbsp;Logic analysis with a bus analyzer 
shows that Linus's heavy use of trap gates for system calls and TLB flushing 
during process context switches is a serious&nbsp;factor.&nbsp; Both NT and 
Netware use page level protection, however, these two OS's perform some 
optimizations that are absent in Linux.&nbsp; There are also some severe 
parallelism issues with the Linux code base proper and the way shared 
synchronization is done (or rather isn't done) that reduces the parallelsim of 
Linux and the file systems.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>We will be locking down final code for 2.0.37 next 
week.&nbsp; 2.2/2.3 will post in about three to four weeks.&nbsp; We may post 
earlier versions if Larry Angus gives us a green light on these code 
bases.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>We are also pleased to let everyone know our next 
Open Source Linux project in Novell's Netware Directory Services on Linux as an 
Open Source Intiative.&nbsp; We are about 60% complete on an Open Source NDS for 
Linux.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>We want to thank Alan Cox, Linus(x), Al Viro, Steve 
Spicer, and all the wonderul Linux folks who really helped out with this project 
and helped us get it tested and out the door.&nbsp; Special thanks to Ray 
Noorda, founder and former CEO of Novell who funded this Open Source project for 
the benefit of the Linux Community then asked us to Open Source the File System 
portion for all to use and enjoy.&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>This isn't the last time you'll hear from us, stay 
tuned, NDS is next for Linux from us.&nbsp; We will post an announcement next 
week&nbsp;during the Linux&nbsp;show.</FONT></DIV>
