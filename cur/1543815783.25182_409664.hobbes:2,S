This race is already there.  Header comment on steal_locks() documents
it.
The patch does open this race window much wider, because pending locks
are also transfered to the task doing the exec.  The original
steal_locks() only stole already held locks.  But I don't think this
fundamentaly changes things.  It just shows more clearly how ugly the
current semantics are.
