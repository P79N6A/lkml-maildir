Ouch. What happens if you
	mkdir foo
	create foo/bar
	rename foo/bar baz/bar
	rmdir foo
and ditto for
	mkdir foo
	create foo/bar
	open foo/bar
	unlink foo/bar
	rmdir foo
- where does your packing locality <whatever> go?
Another question: how does your write_inode() interact with readdir() and
friends on parent? Do they need any sort of exclusion? What kind of
metadata is stored in the directory and is it affected by notify_change()?
One more: suppose you've got
	create foo/bar
	link foo/bar baz/bar
	unlink foo/bar
	create foo/quux		unlink baz/bar
Do the last two of them need any sort of exclusion? VFS _does_ allow the
last two happen at the same time. You have big lock, but if one of them
blocks (and you are very unlikely to avoid that) - that's it.
The reason why I'm asking is that I've done a filesystem with metadata in
directory and I know what kind of PITA it can become. _And_ I've dealt
with a monster that keeps metadata in directory trying to support links.
In case if you wonder - it's AFFS. It's racey as hell and basically I'm
trying to figure out how did you solve the same set of problems.

And how do you expect NFS to handle that?

	Unfortunately, NFS can't survive without that. POSIX also requires
constant inumbers, BTW.

What's the size of key?

Wait a minute. Assume that somebody gave you the key of directory. Can you
find the key of its current parent? Notice that it could very well be
renamed since the moment of its cretion.

Erm... I need details on the locking you use within your tree. This scheme 
has a huge potential for hidden (and hard to hit unless you know what you
are hunting for) races, unless you are very accurate with that stuff. One
more thing that began to scare me - readdir() and offsets in directory.
How do you do them?
