Subject: [PATCH] undo 2.5.34 ftape damage

In the 2.5.33->2.5.34 step someone removed "export-objs" from
drivers/char/ftape/lowlevel/Makefile, which makes it impossible to build
ftape as a module since is _does_ have a number of EXPORT_SYMBOL's.
The patch below reverts that change. Linus, please apply.
