Do people actually still use ksymoops for 2.6 kernels ?
I resorted to it about 6 months ago for the first time in the
better part of 3 years, and it didn't even compile.
(I only wanted to disassemble a Code: line, addr resolution
 works for me [and most other distros afaik] with kksymoops now)

Given we've extended the oops output in several different
ways without thought in the past, it seems a bit late.
We added printing of module list in the middle of the output.
We added various tainting flags over time.
What other tools parse oopses ? ksymoops is the only one I recall.

I'd be surprised if anyone noticed.
*shrug*, in an ideal world, no-one would ever see an oops anyway :-P
