We need to keep an eye on both the intra- and the inter-cpu
pipe-bandwidth and should measure them explicitly.  The problem is
that at the moment, we get one, the other, or a mixture of the two,
subject to the vagaries of the scheduler.  If we could reliably
measure both intra and inter-cpu cases, we may well find new
optimization opportunities (I'm almost certain that's the case for the
cross-cpu case; which is probably the more important case, actually).
