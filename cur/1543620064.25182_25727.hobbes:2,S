Yes, sorry - I didn't test against Alan's pnpbios driver.
The problem is this, in init/main.c:
#ifdef CONFIG_PNPBIOS
    pnpbios_init();
#endif
    ....
    start_context_thread();
    do_initcalls();
pnpbios_init() launches a kernel thread which calls the kernel/user.c
code before the user.c's initcall has had a chance to initialise things.
I've asked Alan to back out the rather unimportant set_user-in-reparent_to_init
fix while we contemplate this.
I suggest you disable the pnpbios driver in kernel config in -ac3.
