Not just offtopic but completely unacceptable in this case.
There are people on these lists who work on free software R300 reverse
engineering work. They do not look at and do not want to be exposed in
any way to proprietary ATI code.
Please don't do this again or if you do post the patches somewhere and
send a message indicating where they can be found.
