Your filesystem handling code is completely superflous (and buggy).  Please
remove all the code dealing with chroot-lookalikes.  In your userland script
you simpl have to clone(.., CLONE_NEWNS) to detach your namespace from your
parent, then you can lazly unmount all filesystems and setup your new namespace
before starting the jail.  The added advantage is that you don't need any
cludges to keep the user from exiting the chroot.

I don't see you using the BKL anywhere.

Why that many blank lines?

please user module_param

again no need to itnialize.

How do you habdle non-ip networking?  This really needs to be handled
more generally.

That's a really awkward interface.

bah.  Please use container_of or better get lsm folks to just pass you
a struct file *

oh, please.  Don't submit such a crap.
if you want to disable sysctl access do it on the sysctl, not procfs level.
And disabling access to /proc/ide and /proc/scsi as two very special cases
(what about /proc/md, /proc/cciss or /proc/cpqarray?) is totally bullocks,
if they allow hardware interaction without checking for capabailities
fix them in the driver code.
This half-aided security by obscurity crap _is_ going to bite later on.
