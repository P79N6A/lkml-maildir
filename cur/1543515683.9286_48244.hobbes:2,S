What will it buy? You still have to write all this code. You still can't
(and shouldn't) do it on a filesystem that is mounted r/w. This code can
be equally easy placed into userspace (where it _is_ now). It doesn't give
you any win in fsck(8) (it's _not_ in ALL CAPS, BTW), since the current
fsck _already_ doesn't care for filesystem layout - it just calls an
appropriate fsck.<something>.
All the difference you'll get will be that e2fsck will be moved into
fs/ext2, fsck.minix - into fs/minix, etc. I.e. complexity is the same,
except that the code will (a) permanently in core and (b) any bug will 
bcome more dangerous, since you are in ring 0.
So the question being: What For? We already have generic fsck. It sits in
/sbin/fsck. We already have generic mkfs (/sbin/mkfs). What's the reason
to move large chucks of code that feels perfectly OK in userland into the
kernel? Automagical fsck upon mount? It's a bug, not a feature. That
decision belongs to admin. Even if you want it (always want it, that is)
you can trivially do it in mount(8) or in the script that calls mount.
If NT really does what you describe... Well, small wonder that it's so
bloated.
