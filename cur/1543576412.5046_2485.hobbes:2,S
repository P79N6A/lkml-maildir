Hi 
I would like to point who ever is in charge of the TCP stack for the linux 
kernel at a site which claims to have a method of eliminate denial of service 
(DoS) attacks
http://grc.com/r&d/nomoredos.htm
With my limited unstanding of TCP and DoS attacks this would seem to be the 
answer, instead of a work around.
Cheers
