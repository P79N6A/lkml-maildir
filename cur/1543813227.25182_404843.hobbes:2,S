I tried a cold boot yesterday after got physical access to the 
machine. I couldn't reproduce the problem nor with plain 2.6.16-rc5 
nor the same patched with printk patch from Dave Hansen. I touched 
all the DIMMs and have to admit all of them are rather loosely 
fitted into the mainboard. I will probably flash the BIOS. I will 
retry few more reboots and if I manage to reproduce it I'll post 
back. Otherwise, consider it either mechanical problem with the size 
of those Kingston 2GB DDR DIMMs or MSI9136 mainboard layout or BIOS 
bug. Description of the interresting board capable of even 32GB RAM 
is at
