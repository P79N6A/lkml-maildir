 Please report a full bootstrap log when started with the "debug" option
if you want anything to be done about it.  Actually it's possible we can
handle such a configuration, but given the BIOS was unable to initialize
the second CPU properly (possibly due to a bug or a misfeature) we may
need to add some sanitizing code.  APIC errors are relatively
insignificant issue here, especially if you only get a few of them --
people report lots of them on systems that should be completely stable (I
have yet to see one myself, but maybe I'm just using weird systems that
completely refuse to generate them... ;-) ).
