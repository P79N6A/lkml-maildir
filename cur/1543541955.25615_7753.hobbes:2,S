Ok, lets then move the input.c, mousedev.c, evdev.c, keybdev.c and joydev.c to a
common directory (be it drivers/input, drivers/char, drivers/char/input
or whatever then). Moving just input.c doesn't help anything. 
I don't mind the drivers being sorted by the bus the interface (bus)
they live on (gameport / usb / serial port / whatever) or by the
interface they provide (scsi / input / network / whatever). Both have
their logic. I believe the later is nicer, though.
Also, I doubt the usb interface is less stable than the input one, so I
really believe both the choices are equal.
However, if now more than just the usb drivers use the mousedev, evdev,
keybdev and joydev, and these (input -> chardevice) drivers don't live
on usb or provide usb, they should be moved out of the usb dir to be
accessible by others even when CONFIG_USB is not set.
input.c and the *dev.c files need to live in a separate directory or at
least in a directory that is not dependent itself on any config option
(drivers/char for example).
So: would you accept a patch that does this? I suppose yes. Should the
destination be drivers/char? I suppose yes. Good. By the way, we are
moving these files to a directory named by what they provide. (The
opposite of the usb approach). Not that I mind ...
