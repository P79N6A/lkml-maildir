  I suspect that in many cases there is third copy right in the network
  card driver to realign data so that TCP frame begins at a 32-bit boundary.
  Perhaps that is only for RISC CPU systems (e.g. Alpha, primarily.)
  Can the GigE cards do ethernet-frame reception pre-alignment so that
  after the 14 byte ethernet header, the TCP frame begins at 32-bit 
  boundary ?
