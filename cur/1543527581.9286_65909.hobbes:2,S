I think it might have to be :-). Well, how many zombies can _you_ spawn?

You mean "out of there". Well, yes, it might well ask if you want init
to vamoosh them, or whether you'd like a core dump instead.

Not bad (isn't it the task that isn't?). But using the inodes as
numbers and the names as names might make more sense! /proc/kernel,
/proc/init, etc... (and there is nothing wrong with /proc/lost+found,
except that it had better have a crazy inode number, as it can't ever
collect itself).
What does this clutter matter, btw?  I think the valid point you really
have concerns the chroot'ed root who can mount /proc and therefore get
at all processes ..  as though he couldn't already mount the disk
partitions and do enough damage (and telnet to his own copy of telnetd
...).
