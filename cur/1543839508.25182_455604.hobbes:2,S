In turn it is fundamental to the curious
granularity of privileged operations in Unix.
I maintain that the real value in the POSIX
capability model derives from seperating the
permission to violate policy from the UID.
Granularity of such privilege is a bonus, and
a matter of considerable debate. DGUX ended
up with over 330 distinct capabilities, while
Irix had (last I looked) 24, and Solaris
came in somewhere between. All these systems
work.
