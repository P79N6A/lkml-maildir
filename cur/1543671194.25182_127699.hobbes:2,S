Simply said, I don't like "initrd". I have still to figure out how to
make an "initrd" that includes the newer modutils.
Anyways, I don't mantain so much kernels (only 3 or 4 different
versions), and have a mix of AMD/P4/P3/P2/PI machines that need things
that can't be configured/don't yet work as modules, so I prefer to pass
initrd by...
