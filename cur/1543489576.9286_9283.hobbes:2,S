	Need some x86 users to watch the processor usage on their X
process to see if it goes out of control under the straight (Linus branch)
2.2.3 kernel.  500Mhz DEC Miata w/128M brought to it's knees within 5
minutes of starting X (XF86_3DLabs server) - 95% processor usage and
above.  Already know something is wrong from the strace, just need some
x86 people to see if they also experience this problem.
Thanks,
Daniel
The relevant strace dump of [pid X] is below for your convenience:
read(3, 0x11ffff670, 64)                = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily
 unavailable)
read(4, "\10", 64)                      = 1
gettimeofday({921129889, 670900}, NULL) = 0
select(128, [0 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11], NULL, NULL, {110, 994000}) = 1 (in
 [4], left {110, 994000})
read(3, 0x11ffff670, 64)                = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily
