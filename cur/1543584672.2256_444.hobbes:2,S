Here ya go (wrote this a few years ago):
// This function is so cool.
template<class T>
void list<T>::qsort(iter l, iter r, cmpfunc *cmp, void *data)
{
        if(l==r) return;
        iter i(l), p(l);
        for(i++; i!=r; i++)
                if(cmp(*i, *l, data)<0)
                        i.swap(++p);
        l.swap(p);
        qsort(l, p, cmp, data);
        qsort(++p, r, cmp, data);
}
Iters are essentially list pointers with increment operations. This is a
fairly direct adaptation of the quicksort in K&R, actually.
