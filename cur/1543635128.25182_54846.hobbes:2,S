With any luck gone and Bartlomiej who actually knows something about the
hardware and driver design is now going to be running the show.
I gather his latest patch revert many of the bogus bugs designed by MD.
You should pray he does not come back!
Bartlomiej is significantly more capable and more of a storage architect.
I trust he will be doing the correct thing.
Cheers,
