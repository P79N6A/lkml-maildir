Wrong, plugin is called just below entry point from the VFS to the
file-system back-end. It can use reiser4 tree, or any storage layer it
wants. Or none at all: think about pseudo-files like
foo/metas/uid---they are also implemnted by plugins.
Programmer dedicated enough can (besides programming Fortran in any
language), write reiser4 plugin for any file-system. I will leave
description of this activity to people with better command over English
language.
