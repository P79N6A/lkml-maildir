Yes, that is where the locking problems were.
When I last looked at it the problem call path was:
serial8250_interrupt();
    spin_lock(port->lock);
    serial8250_handle_port();
       receive_chars();
          flip.work.func(); /* if FLIP buffer full or low_latency set */
              ldisc->receive_buf(); /* N_TTY */
                  tty->driver->flush_chars();
                     uart_start();
                        spin_lock(port->lock); *BANG*
