Kernel implementers can indeed produce a crappy kernel that meets the
letter of a standard. Why would they want to make a crappy kernel?
Hey, Windows NT is POSIX. Is that good enough for you?

Nope, fork() doesn't share the address space.
There isn't any reason to have a useless system call that nobody can
stand to use. It is completely reasonable to have a vfork() that lets
the child set up IO before the exec, but still shares address space.
