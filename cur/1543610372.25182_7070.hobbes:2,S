Umm...
	a) /proc/interrupts has buffer overflows.
	b) I have a patch that should fix them (conversion to seq_file,
done for all architectures)
	c) while completely straightforward, it's large (every subarchitecture
of m68k and mips seems to have its own get_irq_list()) and may contain typos
in architectures I've no access to.
	d) holes had been there for quite a while and it's either
"cat /proc/interrupts always causes memory corruption" or "everything OK"
I'm not quite sure where it is - if we were in -pre<small> I'd definitely
say that it's worth merging, so that trivial typos could be caught before
the release; the hole obviously deserves fixing.  OTOH, merging that in -final
means that we are risking "2.4.15 doesn't compile on <architecture>"...
