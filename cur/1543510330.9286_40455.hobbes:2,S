This is a non SMP module built against an SMP kernel. In this case its
a Red Hat specific "accident trap".  Add smp to the EXTRAVERSION flag sin
the top make file
I would actually suggest you pick up a newer kernel (2.2.12 say) and built
that from scratch with your driver, rather than trying to build your modules
without having a full kernel build tree to hand

Very odd.

I've actually had 8 disks on a qlogic FC without a problem.
