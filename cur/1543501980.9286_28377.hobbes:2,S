Well, yes, I'm holding the lock for the scheduler, for the runqueue, and
for the tasklist when I'm doing my search/update ( I told you, it wasn't
very efficient ).
I'm trying to implement a resource scheduler for multiprocessors. This
is used for real-time tasks, and a part of it requires me to to do a
task partition ( decide to which processor assign a task, and control
the inherent migration of the goodness() funtion ) based on the
requirements of the task. Sometimes I have the problem that, due to the
characteristics/requirements of a task, I need to move it from the CPU
that is running to another ( that's where my problem comes, 'cause it's
possible that other task besides the idle is running at that CPU, and I
will need to suspend it, migrate the desired task, and force a
reschedule on that CPU ).
What does it mean "the answer is inherently out of date" ? :-)
