I'm busy giving a netfilter tutorial all day, but I'll do the
incremental patch + testing tonight.  So I expect some kind of reply on
this at about 11pm (GMT+1).
Sorry once again for the delays, but as I said initially: I'm neither a
core kernel / scheduler nor a USB developer.  If somebody else had taken
the bug, we'd have had way less round-trips...
Cheers,
