Why only SHCED_FIFO and not SCHED_RR?
Their (mis)behavior is similar wrt SCHED_NORMAL tasks.

I guess, put_prev_task() / set_curr_task() should be called (for the
case of task_running(p)) to make it group-scheduler-friendly (as it's
done e.g. in sched_setscheduler()).
(normilize_task() should probably do the same)
