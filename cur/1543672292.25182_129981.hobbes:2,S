Duh.  Good eyes.  Fixed.

I think you're right.

I think drivers/base/bus.c: driver_attach() is what we want, which will
walk the list of the bus's devices and run bus_match() which is
pci_bus_match() which will scan for us.  Just need to un-static
driver_attach() I expect.  Pat, does this sound right?
If that works, probe_each_pci_dev() can go away.  I'll play with it some
more.
Thanks,
Matt
