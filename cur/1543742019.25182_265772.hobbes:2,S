You won't be alone either ... so I'll be glad to get
rid of those pointless usbcore "non-error" messages!

Thomas put "usbutils" into CVS at linux-usb.sf.net and
that version has the Debian patches to make it use the
system's "libusb" instead of its own older snapshot.
Plus bugfixes, and printing more descriptors.
It looks like libusb-0.1.8 still expects the kernel to
return a little-endian device descriptor rather than
its private byteswapped version.
