A trivial change...

Cool, send it to me !

There were no problems with the original patch with LILO.
You just must use append="root=xxxxx" instead of simply
root=xxx , because LILO tries to be "smart" .... at least the
version I used then did.

This an ugly hack , if you ask me. The identificators ( be it labels ,
UUIDs
or whatever ) should be outside the partitions. Otherwise cases with
swap partitions , <any FS that doesn't support labels/UUIDs> unformatted
partitions etc. can not be handled.
