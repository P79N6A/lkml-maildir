MAX_LINKS > 32 would result in larger statically allocated pointer
arrays.  It would also only work if NPROTO is increased too, IIRC.
I strongly disrecommend increasing NPROTO.  Maybe we should look into
reusing NETLINK_FIREWALL (which was an old 2.2.x kernel interface).
But to be honest, I don't really care all that much as long as existing
and still very actively used values are not just overloaded.
