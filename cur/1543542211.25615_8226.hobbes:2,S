I wonder if this was a good idea. Look at these code pieces from
do_fork which are now executed without any lock held:
| retval = -EAGAIN;
| if (atomic_read(&p->user->processes) >= p->rlim[RLIMIT_NPROC].rlim_cur)
| 	goto bad_fork_free;
| atomic_inc(&p->user->__count);
| atomic_inc(&p->user->processes);
This looks like an SMP race, that could allow a user to get more
processes than the number allowed by rlim. Mostly harmless, probably.

| if (nr_threads >= max_threads)
| 	goto bad_fork_cleanup_count;
If this is really  ok the comment should be removed and nr_threads
should better be atomic_t.
| p->pid = get_pid(clone_flags);
The pid returned by get_pid is not yet reserved, i.e. it won't be found
when get_pid searches the task list for used pids. Another call to get_pid
could theoretically return the same pid before the pid gets used here.
This is highly improbable, but if it actually happend it would probably
cause a big mess.
Are these races in fact impossible and I overlooked something or do
we take the risk because they either can't do to much harm or (like in
the last case) are too unlikely to happen?
    best regards   Christian
