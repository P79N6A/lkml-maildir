your original claim and these additional claims are both incorrect. What 
Mike said is true: there is nothing "missing", RT class tasks do not 
need any extra setup over what they already receive from the generic 
function. A NULL pointer for sched_class->task_new means: "do default 
setup, no class-specific setup needed". If you disagree with what we say 
then please send a fix-patch or quote the specific code that is missing 
something in your opinion.
