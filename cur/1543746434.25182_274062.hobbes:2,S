I'm not sure why you say it's bogus. Ext2 for instance has long had a
mount option similar to this and it makes sense in volatile
environments. Having the flag in the superblock seems a sensible way
of doing it as well.

This is to protect against usage patters like mv a b, oh look, it's
done, unplug. Not lots of active readers/writers.

Perhaps. I think the behavior should be to honor the superblock flag
by default, overridable with -o sync|async at mount.
