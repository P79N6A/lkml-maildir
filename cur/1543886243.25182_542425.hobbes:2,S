Sure.  The patch I have here says 42 insertions, 44 deletions :)

I don't see a strong precedence for this for static functions.  For example, 
if you grep for 'static' in drivers/usb/core, there's a mix of usb_* prefixed 
functions and functions without a consistent prefix.  Plus, when the drivers 
are loaded as modules, the module name will be in the stack trace.  I can 
track down the most generic sounding functions and give them a fw_ prefix, but 
doing a whole-sale prefixing of static functions will make the source more 
noisy and reduce readabilty - I'm not sure it's worth it.
cheers,
Kristian
