Hi,
 for a while now I am having problems writing large files sequentially to EXT2 filesystems on CCISS based boxes. The problem is that writing multiple files in parallel is extremely slow compared to a single file in non-DIO mode. When using DIO, the scaling is almost "perfect". The problem manifests itself in RHEL4 kernels (2.6.9-X) and any mainline kernel up to 2.6.24-rc8.
 The systems in question are HP/DL380G4 with 2 cpus, 8 GB memory, SmartArray6i (CCISS) with BBWC and 4x72GB@10krpm disks in RAID5 configuration. Environment is 64-bit RHEL4.3.
 The problem can be reproduced by running 1, 2 or 3 parallel "dd" processes, or  "iozone" with 1, 2 or 3 threads. Curiously, there was a period from 2.6.24-rc1 until 2.6.24-rc5 where the problem went away. It turned out that this was due to a "regression" that was "fixed" by below commit. Unfortunatelly this is not good  for my systems, but it might shed some light on the underlying problem:

 Reverting this patch from 2.6.24-rc8 gives the good performance reported below (rc8*). So, apparently CCISS is very sensitive to the page ordering.
 Here are the numbers (MB/sec) including sync-time. I compare 2.6.24-rc8 (rc8) and 2.6.24-rc8 with abore commit reverted (rc8*). Reported is the combined throughput for 1,2,3 iozone threads, for reference also the DIO numbers. Raw numbers are attached.
Test                  rc8      rc8*
----------------------------------------
1x3GB              56       90
1x3GB-DIO       86       86
2x1.5GB           9.5      87
2x1.5GB-DIO    80       85
3x1GB             16.5     85
3x1GB-DIO       85       85
 One can see that in mainline/rc8  all non-DIO numbers are smaller than the corresponding DIO numbers, or the non-DIO numbers from rc8*. The performance for 2 and 3 threads in mainline/rc8 is just bad.
 Of course I have the option to revert commit ....54b6d for my systems, but I think a more general solution would be better. If I can help tracking the real problem down, I am open for suggestions.
Cheers
Martin
