Does it actually work with NFS???? or any networked file system?
Most of them limit ngroups to 16 to 32, and cannot send any data
if there is an overflow, since that overflow would replace all of the
data you try to send/recieve...
And I really doubt that anybody has 10000 unique groups (or even
close to that) running under any system. The center I'm at has
some of the largest UNIX systems ever made, and there are only
about 600 unique groups over the entire center. The largest number
of groups a user can be in is 32. And nobody even comes close.
