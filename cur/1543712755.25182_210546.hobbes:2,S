Wouldn't be better to just remove #ifdef CONFIG_X86_CMPXCHG around __cmpxchg() 
and cmpxchg macro in ./include/asm-i386/system.h so cmpxchg() would be there 
always even on i386 but leave CONFIG_X86_CMPXCHG macro if anyone want's to 
check for it in some code. No code duplication and you get what you need.
It would be something like:
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_CMPXCHG
#define __HAVE_ARCH_CMPXCHG 1
#endif
static inline unsigned long __cmpxchg(volatile void *ptr, unsigned long old,
                                      unsigned long new, int size)
{
}
#define cmpxchg(ptr,o,n)\
        ((__typeof__(*(ptr)))__cmpxchg((ptr),(unsigned long)(o),\
                                        (unsigned long)(n),sizeof(*(ptr))))
instead of current:
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_CMPXCHG
#define __HAVE_ARCH_CMPXCHG 1
static inline unsigned long __cmpxchg(volatile void *ptr, unsigned long old,
                                      unsigned long new, int size)
{
}
#define cmpxchg(ptr,o,n)\
        ((__typeof__(*(ptr)))__cmpxchg((ptr),(unsigned long)(o),\
                                        (unsigned long)(n),sizeof(*(ptr))))
#else
/* Compiling for a 386 proper.  Is it worth implementing via cli/sti?  */
#endif
