fs seems to be ok fsck-wise:
# mount -o remount,ro /.3
# reiserfsck /dev/sdc3
reiserfsck 3.6.11 (2003 www.namesys.com)

However, there is one strange thing: I cannot umount it.
Why? There is no open files.
# umount /.3
umount: /.3: device is busy
# lsof -nP | grep -F '/.3'
# lsof -nP | grep -F 'sdc'
# uname -a
