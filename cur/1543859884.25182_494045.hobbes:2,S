Hm.. I see. Sounds sane to me. Well, my patch didn't add the new
workaround of broken table, it just fixes the oops of existence workaround.
Current workaround is the following (both of linus and -mm),
	if (pci_mmcfg_config_num == 1 &&
		cfg->pci_segment_group_number == 0 &&
		(cfg->start_bus_number | cfg->end_bus_number) == 0)
                /* Assume it can access 256M range */
But, if the system has bus number 0 only, it's a correct table.
We may need to detect the broken system. blacklist?
