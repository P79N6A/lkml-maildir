	Thank you!  I applied the changes in your patch to
drivers/block/ide-{proc,disk}.c, and it works.  As proof to
the world of this, ftp.yggdrasil.com is now running a 2.2.13
kernel with the patch, and that 36GB disk that I mentioned is now
in service as the metalab mirror at
ftp://ftp.yggdrasil.com/mirrors/site/metalab.unc.edu.
