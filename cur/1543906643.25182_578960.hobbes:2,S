And we know that we're not safe suspending scanners and many printers 
by default.  But that leaves plenty of other device classes unaccounted 
for.

If it takes longer than 15 minutes, something is wrong.  At that point 
the user will have worse things to worry about than whether some USB 
devices got suspended.
And 15 minutes is a perfectly reasonable autosuspend timeout for 
devices that might be plugged in all day long.
