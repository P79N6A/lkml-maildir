IMHO yes.  This is an integral part of the filesystem, and the handlers are
really small anyway.  And it makes the code really a lot simpler.

I'd call them generic_.  I've done some research and they should work very
well for any xattr implementation in the tree.  As I mentioned in the
previous mail I'd like to get rid of the old inode operations for xattrs
completely in the long-term (I had been researching this before your patch
because I wanted to get rid of the access control checks in the filesystem
that are inherent with theses)
