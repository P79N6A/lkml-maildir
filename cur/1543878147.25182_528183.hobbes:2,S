You have just come up with a really good reason not to do unlimited 
loops. With the current limit people can count on a script mounting 
files, or similar, to neither loop for a VERY long time or to eat their 
memory. Whatever you think of programs without limit checking, this 
falls in the range of expecting an unsigned char to have a certain upper 
bound, and argues that the default limit should be the current limit and 
that setting a lower bound should work as a real and enforced limit.
If a new capability is being added, and I think it's a great one, then 
people using the capability should be the ones explicitly doing 
something different. Plauger's law of least astonishment.
