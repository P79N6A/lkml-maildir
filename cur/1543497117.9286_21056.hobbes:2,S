IPv6 tries to change multicast lists from interupt context (=call
dev->set_multicast_list in the net_bh). Maybe your card does not like that.
There were some problems with that in the past. Also the EEPro100 seems to
have pretty bizarre multicast list handling.
Hmm, for tests you could hack the driver's set_multicast_list function
to use promiscuous mode like the really dumb drivers do
