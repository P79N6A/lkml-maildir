Certainly on debian make-kpkg actually does have options for initrd
(--initrd) and will call mkinitrd/update-initramfs/yaird at package
install time to generate an initrd for the kernel to deal with raid,
lvm, etc.  It works quite well in general.
I would be surprised if redhat didn't do something similar.
