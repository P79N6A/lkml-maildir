That looks good, but it was probably better in a "portmux.h" header.
(Although the at32_* prefixes help a lot!)  You don't use the flags
AT32_GPIO_PULLUP etc, either.
Other than that pinmux confusion, this looks pretty much OK to me.
The GPIO stuff matches the proposal.

That is, pins without that set are still configured how the bootloader
left them ... possibly as they were left by system reset.  On some systems
it might be desirable to warn when the mode Linux wants isn't what the
bootloader left, so that all the muxing code can be left out of Linux.
(Not that it can save much on AT91 or AVR32, but the bootloader was probably
writing those registers anyway, and saving codespace and boot time tends
to be a Good Thing.)  Or so that Linux can't, oh, change the state of
the GPIO that keeps the saw switched off.  ;)
I notice you didn't have a way to return pins to an "unclaimed" state
though, which would probably be disadvantageous in some cases.  I don't
agree with the arguments made by Paul Mundt that such usage would be a
common thing ... but on the other hand, I bet you'd get complaints from
various folk if you make re-muxing excessively painful.

Sounds OK.  You are thus _requiring_ the pin muxing to have been
done before the gpio pin is requested ... sort of complicates the
"Linux uses bootloader's pin muxing" model.

A constant like PULLUP_OFF would be clearer in these cases.

Declared as "flags" elsewhere, not "use_pullup"...
