 - What about drivers which have no MAINTAINER entry but reside in a
   subsystem with MAINTAINER entry?
 - What if these drivers depend on two subsystems?
 - Config options map to object files but do not map directly to source
   files. Diffstats show source files.
Example: The sbp2 driver is an IEEE 1394 driver and a SCSI driver.
sbp2.o is enabled by CONFIG_IEEE1394_SBP2 which depends on
CONFIG_IEEE1394 and CONFIG_SCSI. sbp2.c resides in drivers/ieee1394/.
What is the algorithm to look up sbp2's maintainers?
Don't get me wrong though. Easier lookup of maintainers and mailinglists
sounds to me like a desirable feature, not just from the point of view
of submitters but also of maintainers.
