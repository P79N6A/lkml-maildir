In theory perhaps. In practice it isnt sane at all.
(That is, the majority of the keyboards sold today do not do as one
would wish. Since Microsoft does not require anything for Set 3,
behaviour in Set 3 is essentially random, especially for these
additional keys and buttons. A single keypress may give several
scancodes, or none at all. Many laptops do not have any support
for Set 3. USB compatibility only implements compatibility with
translated Set 2.)
