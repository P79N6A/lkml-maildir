I posted a fix for the nr_segments thing a few days ago (that was a bug in
the code). Don't worry, it's completly harmless. You can ignore it for
now.
I debugged the __elevator_merge message and such printk has to be
definitely deleted. It's the printk that is wrong, the code is _right_,
So ignore it too for now.
I am now in the process of partially rewriting the request merging code so
that I don't seek back and forth if not necessary. I am trying to exploit
all possible optimizations. As other change I am now considering special
requests (inserted in the queue by the device driver itself) as barriers
for the I/O scheduler (that seems the right thing to do to me).
So basically stay tuned and ignore the elevator messages for now, there's
nothing to worry about and it's just stable.
Thanks for the report.
Andrea
