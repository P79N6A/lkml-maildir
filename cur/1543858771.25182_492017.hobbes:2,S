pci-move-pci_vdevice-from-libata-to-core.patch
pata_cs5530-suspend-resume-support-tweak.patch
ata-fix-platform_device_register_simple-error-check.patch
initializer-entry-defined-twice-in-pata_rz1000.patch
pata_via-suspend-resume-support-fix.patch
sata_nv-add-suspend-resume-support.patch
libata-simulate-report-luns-for-atapi-devices.patch
user-of-the-jiffies-rounding-patch-ata-subsystem.patch
libata-fix-oops-with-sparsemem.patch
sata_nv-fix-kfree-ordering-in-remove.patch

pci-quirks-fix-the-festering-mess-that-claims-to-handle-ide-quirks-ide-fix.patch
