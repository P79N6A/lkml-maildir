Yes, that seems to be more accurate.

Well, the ACPI spec suggests to save the image somewhere after the devices
have been but into low power states, which is kind of unreasonable. :-)

Well, there are some complications.  For example, _BFS and _WAK should be
executed with interrupts on (I'm told that the AML interpreter might not work
with interrupts disabled) and the nonboot CPUs should be offline while they
are being executed.  Perhaps we should also avoid playing with APICs and
things like that after executing _WAK, so it's better to execute them from the
restored kernel.

For some devices it may be illegal to leave them powered on while entering
S3.
