Sorry, I didn't mean "on the stack" I ment, they are static and not
dynamically allocated.

Ok, then I suggest you look into them then :)
Again, creating a struct device that is not dynamically allocated is not
allowed.  And creating a struct device that is not tied into the driver
tree, is also a bad thing.  Use the ones that are already present, or
register yours with the core so they show up properly.
