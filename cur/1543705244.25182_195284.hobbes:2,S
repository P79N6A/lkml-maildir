I tested the following firmware versions and all failed identically to 
set the WEP key in Linux.
5.30.17
5.20.17
5.02.20

Used the ACU tool under Windows XP for flashing the firmware.  The 
newest firmware version that operates with your driver is:
5.00.03
Perhaps mention within a comment and/or config Help of your patch that 
the newest supported firmware is 5.00.03?  That would save people like 
me a lot of time in the future...

Tested this theory.  It seems that airo is unable to set the WEP key 
after ACU has done so.
So your airo driver is working with the 5.00.03 firmware, but there is 
this one remaining issue.  notting@redhat.com mentioned it is failing to 
"rename" something but I cannot remember the details.
During bootup it fails to recognize the airo device exists.  iwconfig 
shows some weird "devXXXXX" device that is not associated with an ethX 
name.  rmmod airo gets rid of it, and afterward ifup works.  The "Set 
Mode" error is harmless.  It subsequently works.  Any ideas?
