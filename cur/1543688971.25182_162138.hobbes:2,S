Of course, the reason I originally said without the __s, was because
move_from_swap_cache uses __delete_from_swap_cache, and we don't want
interference there.  So best convert that to use __remove_from_page_cache
instead, with INC_CACHE_INFO(del_total) outside the locking, after the
set_page_dirty: would improve symmetry between move_from_ and move_to_.
The instance of __delete_from_swap_cache I say you need to catch, is
that in remove_exclusive_swap_page; though I think its count restrictions
limit it to cornercases like your test program, rather than real
communication between processes.  But hold on, in such a cornercase
(no other references to the swap), what if the process unmaps the vma
containing the futex while it is swapped out and not even in page cache?
Unclear.
