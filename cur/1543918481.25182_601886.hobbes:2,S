@@ -111,6 +111,12 @@ of kilobytes free.  The VM uses this num
 value for each lowmem zone in the system.  Each lowmem zone gets 
 a number of reserved free pages based proportionally on its size.
 
+Some minimal ammount of memory is needed to satisfy PF_MEMALLOC

+Setting this too high will OOM your machine instantly.
