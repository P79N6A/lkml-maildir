You are so correct in the Linux<->Linux model, but remember the other OS
has the dominate market space.  I have proof of interoperability.  Better
yet I have performance proof without the ability to control the benchmark
environment.  IIRC that reference is set at version 6.
The market space has version 7,8,9,11,12,13,16,18,19 working group
varitions.  So please anyone who wants to compete, I welcome the
challenge.  Do not forget the hardware, OS license investments.
Oh and Intel's Pro1000 T Storage Adaptor is a joy to work with, and you
all can try to figure it out on your own.  Oh and be sure the take notice
the list of TOE's that do it sideways.  All OS' mixing between ALL OS' is
the challenge.
Do not forget the other dozen or so RFC docs to support the entire
picture.
