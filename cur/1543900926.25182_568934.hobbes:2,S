So really unregister the children.  All we really need to do is disassociate
the drivers from the devices (to reuse the existing code) we don't
need to rescan for the devices.  The associating the device drivers
with devices takes human measurable amount of time.  The only thing
that takes time is waiting on hardware.  Maybe things will suck
and associating the drivers with the device tree with take a whole
second on a bad day, I don't think that is enough time to add
complicated new code paths for the drivers to maintain.

Please Please Plaese do not start with the existing software suspend
to disk code and thinking.  We are not implementing suspend to ram
here or anything like it.  We already have proven code paths that
know how to quiesce hardware.  We already have proven code paths
that know how to take quite hardware and make it run.  Please let's
just use them.  At least until we can see that they are insufficient
to the task.
