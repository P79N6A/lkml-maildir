Yes. So that I could remove tests of 'utf8' in fs/ncpfs/ioctl.c... Pardon
my ignorance, but I know no method to deliver utf8 encoded filename
to userspace, except doing encoding with utf8_mbtowc/_wctomb... :-( If this
could be handled with nls_table, I could remove some ifs from my code
(currently ncpfs accepts 'utf8' string for iocharset and handles it on 
its own, as some people required passing utf8 paths to userspace...)

I'll try that.
