Only if it does lots of disk accesses that load stuff into
page/inode/dentry cache. Single-application guests don't necessarily
do that.

The idea would be to mmap the file into the guest real address space.
With -o xip, the page cache for the virtual device would basically
reside in that high address range.
Guest users reading/writing files on it cause a memcopy between guest
user space and the host file mapping, done by the guest file system
implementation.
The interesting point here is how to handle a host page fault on the
file mapping. The solution on z/VM for this is to generate a special
exception for this that will be caught by the guest kernel, telling
it to wait until the page is there. The guest kernel can then put the
current thread to sleep and do something else, until a second exception
tells it that the page has been loaded by the host. The guest then
wakes up the sleeping thread.
This can work the same way for host file backed (guest block device)
and host anonymous (guest RAM) memory.

In your virtual mmu (or nested page table), you need to make sure that
the page is mapped with the intersection of the guest vm_prot and host
vm_prot into guest users.

Don't understand. Can't one CPU cause a TLB entry to be flushed on all
CPUs?

Yes, dosemu does the same for vm86.

That depends on your trust model. You could simply say that you expect
the guest real mode to have the same privileges as the host application
(your monitor), and not care if a guest can shoot itself in the foot
by overwriting the monitor.

I don't understand much about the x86 specific memory management,
but shouldn't a TLB invalidate of a given page do the right thing
on all CPUs, even if they are currently running a guest?
