It's not as bad as it seems. I haven't tried implementing this; I
believe the Novell kernel debugger is the system that has done so.
Here's what I think needs to be done, but I may be missing something.
1) Track where the scanout buffer is.
2) Track the x/y size of the buffer and it's pixel format
3) Know how to stop the GPU (usually a poke into an IO port)
4) Have a minimal font in the driver - fbdev already has this.
On a panic, stop the GPU and then use the font and buffer info to
paint into the display. fbdev already contains code that can draw
using the fbdev fonts into an arbitrary resolution/pixel format
buffer. The code that implements this is small and is probably already
in the kernel that you are using.
This model doesn't work with the current X server since it never tells
the kernel the location and size of the scan out buffer.
Of course they are windows when this won't work, for example a panic
in the middle of a mode change, but it is a lot better than what we
have today.
