True, but then the original semaphores weren't designed with fairness in 
mind so much as being able to operate quickly.  The commodity SMP hardware 
that we have today has significantly different characteristics than the 
first dual Pentium I used.  I think there is significant room for improving 
the implementation while still making it as tight and lean as possible.  To 
that end, adding state diagrams that make it easier to visualise what is 
going on would be a big help.  With that in place, it will be easier to 
provide optimized fast paths with understandable logic.

Agreed.
