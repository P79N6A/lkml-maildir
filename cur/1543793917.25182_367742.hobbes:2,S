Again I say this is a chip hang, the chip isn't consuming any more data,
so we run out of buffers...
Can you send me lspci -v, /var/log/Xorg.0.log, xorg.conf
If you are running a PCI Radeon you are screwed with the latest Fedora X

really hacky patch from ATI and thought it was a good idea, and now it is
in X.org, or turn off DRI...
