That patch should probably be separated, from the rest.
But it looks like a fairly sane idea.

I think you missed a couple essential things to a time namespace.
Timers.  The posix timers, in particular.  The worst
of those is the monotonic timer.  
In the case of migration the ugly case to properly handle is the
monotonic timer.   That needs an offset yet it is absolutely forbidden
to provide that offset from the inside.  So this is the one namespace
that I think is inappropriate to use sys_unshare to create.
We need a system call so that we can specify the minimum or the
starting monotonic time base.
I don't know how we want to describe time while a process is not
inside of a kernel.

Interesting.

Actually the more I think of the using PTRACE to help with some of
these issues the more I like it.  It's only real alternative is a
security module, and that must be written as kernel code.
The reference counting is terrible, as you don't free syscall_mask,
during ptrace_detach.
As a comparison what is the overhead if you don't use syscall_mask,
and just do a ptrace_cont on the system call you want to let through?
