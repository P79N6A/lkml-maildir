I do not think it is that simple since
 - there is typically more than one class I want to set guarantee to
 - I will not able to use both limit and guarantee
 - Implementation will not be work-conserving.
Also, How would you configure the following in your model ?
5 classes: Class A(10, 40), Class B(20, 100), Class C (30, 100), Class D
(5, 100), Class E(15, 50); (class_name(guarantee, limit))
"Limit only" approach works for DoS prevention. But for providing QoS
you would need guarantee.
