Oh, fair enough.
I don't have any objections to the patch in that case, although it does
end up being a 2.5.x issue as far as I'm concerned (and don't worry, 2.5.x
looks like it will open in a week or two, so we're not talking about long
timeframes).
Obviously 2.5.x code may be back-ported to 2.4.x later. That will be up to
Alan.
