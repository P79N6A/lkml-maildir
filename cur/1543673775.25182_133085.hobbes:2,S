And thanks again, again.
That's the below patch.  It looks pretty innocuous.  I'd be assuming that
there's something in the shutdown sequence which needs 8259 functionality
after the thing has been turned off.
This could well depend upon .config contents and linkage order.
Eric, maybe we need to turn it off by hand at the right time rather than
relying on driver model shutdown ordering?
