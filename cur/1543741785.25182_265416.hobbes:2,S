I'm not sure.  I need help in understanding the different cases of
path_release: (please add any others/discrepencies you see)
 1) path walk (across a mountpoint)
 2) open / close (of a mountpoint)
 3) stat / xattr (of a mountpoint)
The first case, a path walk, will always touch a non-mountpoint root
dentry.  As such, the above snippet will always reset the expire counter
 as some other dentry got path_released.
Case 2, opening of a mountpoint happens when you readdir a the base of
the mounted filesystem.  In this case, you aren't path_releasing on
close, but are doing an explicit mntput(filp->f_vfsmnt).
Case 3, you are accessing meta information of the root of the
mountpoint.  Assuming the call is made from 'outside' the mounted
filesystem, the expire counter is currently ticking.  Access to grab
meta information of the base directory of the mountpoint shouldn't reset
the counter, and in all cases I looked at (minimal), they called
path_release when done.
The above hack^Wsnippet was intended to deal with case #3, but it may
make more sense to look into the matter further and perform the special
case in vfs_l?stat themselves.
Thoughts?

Will do.
