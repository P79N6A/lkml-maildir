I have the same mainboard as you do, GB w/ i440 BX chipset -
as I may assume from your /proc/pci.
Running kernels 2.2.5 - 2.3.8, my hdparm ( v 3.3 ) wouldn´t
give me such troubles.
Still something makes me turn in my sleep:
---------------/var/log/boot.msg------------------
PIIX4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xf000-0xf007, BIOS settings: hda:pio, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xf008-0xf00f, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd:pio
hda: WDC AC26400B, ATA DISK drive
hdb: FX400D, ATAPI CDROM drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
hda: WDC AC26400B, 6149MB w/512kB Cache, CHS=13328/15/63, UDMA
--------------------------------------------------
Note the second line. What´s this?
Chipset not probed correctly?
I got the same result w/ all the kernels mentioned above,
while the old 2.0.xx series seemed okay.
The system works fine of course, no file corruption whatsoever,
however I am sure it causes a performance loss.
This could be a hint for developers..
or make any developer reading this wanting
to shoot me for being so stupid.
If that´s the case, pls drop me a note how to correct the problem.
Niko
