Maybe because install_page() isn't called in the situation I
was talking about. install_page() is called from filemap_populate()
which in turn is called from do_file_map() in handle_pte_fault(),
while I was talking about filemap_nopage() called by do_no_page() in
handle_pte_fault().
And maybe because *every* other call to flush_page_to_ram() has been
replaced by one of the new interface macros except that one in
filemap_nopage() in 'mm/filemap.c'.
