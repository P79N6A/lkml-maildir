Good!

I certainly can post our patches to linux-kernel but in general
they are way to big for the newsgroup. For example the rework of
s390io.c (not yet finished) is already about 12K lines. I'd say
to big for linux-kernel. We usually post problems with common
code on linux-kernel. I dunno about the partition problem. I
might have sent the patch only to Al Viro but at the moment
I am too lazy to check..
