It would be better if someone who has "PCI-to-PCI Bridge Architecture
Specification" handy could confirm this. Non-conforming hardware
must live in quirks/fixups etc. ;-)
I've found some interesting info today - application note on programming
the DEC 21052 bridge (ruffian has this chip, btw):
http://download.sourceforge.net/mirrors/NetBSD/misc/dec-docs/ec-qlzba-te.ps.gz
Particularly, there are examples for setting up that bridge for IO or MEM
only configurations. For example, with IO disabled:
1. Set IO base = 0xffff, limit = 0
2. Set command register = PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY | PCI_COMMAND_MASTER

That change wasn't bad at all - at least it's 100% safe :-)
But of course, it would be better to have unused regions disabled
in a clean way.
But actually I'm concerned that all this code doesn't work at all -
see reports from Michal Jaegermann (the bridge acts as if it drops
config space transactions randomly). I have a lot of suggestions, but
it's a pain to debug something without access to real hardware - just
a waste of the precious time of everyone who is involved...
So I would probably wait a week or two until I'll have something with
bridges :-(
Ivan.
