That I don't know. Marginal power supplies can cause very strange
problems, or there can be motherboard/memory timing issues with lots
of RAM, or just plain old more-than-one-gig-of-RAM-tickles-software
bugs. Though the latter, especially on an x86-64 kernel, really
shouldn't be very common if present at all.
What I'd suggest is resending to the list the first oops after boot
(several of them would be good) while using 2 gigs of RAM, with a new
subject line to attract those who are especially good at reading these
things. (I can barely find the stack trace.)
