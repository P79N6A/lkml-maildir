No .. (1) keeps the same API semantics.

Good - that I understand.  Your position is clear now.
You have chosen (1) above, which keeps Choice A as the default.
Before I leave this part, there is one more thing I kinda really need,
if you could, Christoph.  Could you describe in your own words what you
think Choices A and B mean?  We seem to be having trouble communicating,
and hence there is some risk right now that we don't mean the same thing
by this new "Choice B".

Now ... onto the matter of permanent API warts:

Other alternatives include a per-system, per-cpuset or per-process
flag, in addition to the per-system call flag you suggested earlier
(MPOL_MF_RELATIVE), or whatever you mean by "new set/get mempolicy
functions" ... could you elaborate on that one?
So ... the question becomes this:
  How do we migrate to Choice B, without leaving both Choices
  permanently supported, and an ugly mode flag selecting the
  non-default Choice, while not breaking API's too abruptly?
Thanks.
