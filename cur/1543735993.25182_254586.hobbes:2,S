I've mostly stopped submitting patches using my email client, and
instead submit them using a variant of a 'patch bomb' script.  This has
significantly improved the clerical accuracy of my patch submissions.
The variant I'm using is in pretty good shape - you're welcome to
give it a try.  See the embedded Usage string for documentation.
  
http://www.speakeasy.org/~pj99/sgi/sendpatchset
It handles sending one or several related patches, to a list of email
addresses.  You prepare a text directive file with the addresses,
subjects and pathnames to the files containing the message contents.
Then you send it all off with a single invocation of this 'sendpatchset'
script.
