For many people it's overly verbose and long --- so I assume they just
tune it out.
Sometimes I wonder if it would be a worth-while effort to trim the
dmesg boot text down to what users really *need* to know.  We could
retain most of the other stuff at a different log-level which would be
exposed by a kernel command line parameter or something during boot
for when people have problems.
