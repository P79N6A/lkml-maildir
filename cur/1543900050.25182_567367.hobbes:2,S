Hard to tell.

The insertion / deletion needs to take the timer->base->lock, but this
is cheap as long as the insert / cancel happens on the same CPU.
The other overhead which might be "visible" is when the timer needs to
be re-cascaded in the wheel. See the table below:
         100 250 1000 HZ
[1] 256   10    4   1 ms
[2]  64 2560 1024 256 ms
[3]  64  164   66  16  s
[4]  64  175   70  17  m
[5]  64  186   75  19  h
In the 250Hz case the timer < 1024ms is never re-cascaded. A timer <66s
is re-cascaded at max. once.
So I guess your frequent cancel/restart scheme is just fine. It does not
re-trigger any kind of hardware event and the insertion/deletion is
O(1).
The network code relies on this cheap mechanism on high loaded server
machines.
Hope that helps,
