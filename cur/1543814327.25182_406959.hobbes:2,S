Your intuition was right.  Testing by changing only the DSDT gives
slightly different results than by changing the kernel drivers.  So
far the results:
with only THM0 in the DSDT: HANGS (but only on the second sleep, not
   the first one, so a slight difference with the kernel-testing data)
with only THM0 and all methods doing nothing (either returning 0 or,
   for _TMP, 0xBB8):  NO hang
with only THM0 and all methods except _TMP doing nothing, but _TMP
   doing its normal code: NO hang [that's the difference between DSDT
   and kernel testing]
More bisection coming.
