I just did some experiments.  `killall even init' does indeed render
my machine dead to all inputs.  However, if I boot with
init=/bin/bash, open a shell on tty2, instruct the first bash to sleep
a few seconds and then exit, and switch to tty2, then... all normal
keyboard input is blackholed once process 1 exits, but sysrq continues
to work.  sysrq-T shows a zombie init; the I/O daemons are fine;
sysrq-S syncs the disks and sysrq-B reboots.
I'm not in a position to check whether networking and serial I/O work
under these conditions.  On its face, this looks to me like a bug in
the console driver.  Incidentally, both forms of sysrq killall avoid
kernel threads, so that isn't relevant.
When was it your problem started?
