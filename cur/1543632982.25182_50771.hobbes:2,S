Subject: Process-Shared Mutex (futex) - What is it good for ?

 Nice to have everything as POSIX says, but how could process-shared
mutex be usefull ? Imagine two processes useing one mutex to lock shared
memory area. One process locks, and then dies (for example, it goes
sigSEGV way). Second process could wait for ages (untill reboot ?) and
it won't get lock() on that mutex ever. Wouldn't it be more usefull to
have automatic mutex cleanup after process death ? Just make a cleanup,
and mark it as 'damaged', so other processes will eventualy get error
saying that something went wrong.
