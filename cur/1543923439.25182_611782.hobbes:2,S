but if there's a perfect TSC available (there is such hardware) then the 
TSC _is_ the best clocksource. Paravirt now turns it off unconditionally 
in essence.
anyway, that's at most an optimization issue. No strong feelings here, 
and we can certainly delay this patch until this gets all sorted out.
