=)
You're right, it's not really.  In fact very little is documented.
You'd have to discover it -- in the message view, the Message-ID is
actually a self-referential link using the above syntax.
A few relevant points:
- - Such links never actually show you the corresponding message.  Instead:
   - If the message-id is unique, you are sent a 302 redirect to the
     message using the normal MARC message URL (l=foo&msgid=123)
   - If the message-id is not unique (such as crossposting, or deliberate
     attempts to cause collisions) you'll be presented with a list of
     messages, showing date, subject, author, and listname, to choose from.
- - MARC doesn't currently touch message bodies for spam-obfuscation
   purposes, but it does for headers, specifically From: and Message-ID:.
   When MARC generates message-id-based links, they are obfuscated.
   But it can read in links formed either way.  So, if you copy/paste the
   target of a Message-ID: link out of MARC, it will look slightly
   different than if you just made your own 
http://marc.info/?i=what@not,
   but either form will work.
- - We don't use < > surrounding the message-id, but again, will accept
   URLs formed either way.
- - We don't have Message-ID's for messages added before Dec, 2003.
Please feel free to ping me (offlist) with questions/concerns, hopefully
I will manage to respond :-P
Thanks,
Hank
