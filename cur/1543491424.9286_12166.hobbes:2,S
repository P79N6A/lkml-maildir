   I am not familiar with Linux code.
   But a solution to DMA'ing to user-space will be 
    a) lock the relevant user range into memory.
    b) touch them to fault the pages in. 
    c) Then trap into the kernel using an ioctl to set up kernel address for this
       range. ( I bet there must be some VM calls to acheive that ). What i mean
       is that get the pages behind the locked user-address behind the kernel address.
    d) Do the DMA to these pages.
    e) Release the kernel-mappings.
  This helps in zero-copy DMA. Also the user-pages are still swappable, once the DMA is
  done and after they are unlocked.
 thanks,
 Rama.
