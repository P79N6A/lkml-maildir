As I understand it: instead of providing one device with 5.1 capabilities
provide one device with 3 concurrent stereo users.  Reading the datasheet
of my AC'97 decoder (a cheap ALC650 connected to an ATIIXP) there is hard-
ware that supports this[1].
Sure, Alsa can do all of this and more in software - somehow ...
Ciao, ET.
[1] Unless the ATIIXP has some limitations - there are no docs 
    available :-(
