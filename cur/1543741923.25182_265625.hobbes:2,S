 Here is the rewritten code. I've tested it on my Pegasos, it works. It also should work on 686a in the same manner, but i have no such an equipment.
 Functionality a little changed: you need to specify init_mode=ecp dma=auto arguments to enable DMA support because driver defaults to dma=none. All other things are the same as in previous version.
