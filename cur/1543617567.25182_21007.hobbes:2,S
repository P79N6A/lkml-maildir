Hi,all
An update yet again for those who may care.I tried both aa patch and 
rrmap patch and the aa patch works fine.I havent got any swap issues 
with that patch.The rrmap seemed ok in the beginning but then all hell 
broke loose and it swapped like map and my apps took minutes to start.
Sorry for the lack of details I haven't got time for further debugging :-(
Hopefully I'll get moere time soon and I'll gladly test again..For now I 
stick with 2.4.18pre2 with aa2 patch..
best regards
Christian
