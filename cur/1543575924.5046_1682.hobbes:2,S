SIS 85C496 on Asus sp3 appears to have an equivalent bug (same CSR0
setting fixes kernel deadlocks that occur when using the
non-burst-challenged 0x01A08000 setting), so if you're going to catch it
with a special case in the pci code, you need to catch that as well as the
Saturn II chipset.
Note: the pci probe (cat /proc/pci) on this machine says "No bursts" for
the host bridge.
