I owe you guys an apology for posting that stupid e-mail yesterday. 
1) I posted it from the wrong e-mail address (I'm catching hell for it at
work right now) - oops. 
2) I shouldn't have suggested that 2.3.x destroy data intentionally.
But I won't apologise for calling slashdotters shitheads. Deal with it. 
Cheers,
Alex.
