And the real bug is that you're buggering up the system in the first 
place.
You don't save "current". You save "pid", and then you send a signal using 
that and kill_proc_info(). End of story, bug gone. And it works with 
threaded programs too, which the old thing didn't work at all with.
I refuse to apply this patch - Greg, don't even _try_ to sneak this in 
through a git merge. What a horribly broken thing to do: why would USB 
_ever_ need to know about things like tasklist_lock, and internal signal 
handling functions and rules like "p->sighand"?
