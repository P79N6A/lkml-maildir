I would like to know timing, btw. Size, especially shown 1%, doesn't
matter if link time increased dramatically. `Allyes' config, when i
had fast and rammish machine was terrible thing (last winter). If 32
cores/cpus is will of author, then i'm even more suspicious.

Patch? Did i said patch?
Ah, patch. Yes -- hide it, because it against LKML's rules. I can
provide ftp for such things, easily.
I said tool _and_ documentation. Because if developers don't know
about `static' code or _data_ and cann't find out that, then small
description is more than welcome, i think.
But, tool. Hide it also, becasue it's kind of thing to be shamed

I don't like fast, one-sided solutions.

I just want to have review process to be real not only in C hacking.
