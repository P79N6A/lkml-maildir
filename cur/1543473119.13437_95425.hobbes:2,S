True, the bandwidth problems whereof I choose MTU/MRU 296 are of protocols.
But the defragmentation problem is a kernel problem, as far as I can tell.
It is supposed to be always-defragging, and in some combination, doesn't.
The "ip_input.c" is going to take me well into the next century to
understand well enough to contribute to fixing the problem, though.
I'll let you know when I have tcpdumps that clarify the exactitude,
what I've posted so far is useless as far as really digging into it.
