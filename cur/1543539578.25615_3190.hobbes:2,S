Hi all,
We run a linux-fileserver that exports homedirectories to users.
The server runs 2.2.12 with usermode nfsd. "mount" says:
  tyrfing:/users/card/00 on /users/card/00 type nfs \
  (rw,bg,soft,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,addr=xx.xx.xx.xx)
Some of the clients are ultrasparcs running Solaris 2.5
The performance between linux and solaris is extremely bad, as has
been pointed out on this list a couple of times in the past.
The last time that I could find a thread on linux<->solaris
interoperatebility is from June 99. I hope that in one year
knowledge on the subject might have improved.
My questions:
1) How can this be? Is it the Solaris NFS implementation or the Linux
   NFS implementation?
2) Are there things to tweak on the solaris side?
3) Will another setup on the linux side improve things? 
   Things that come to mind are:
   - tweak blocksize params
   - run 2.2 with kernelmode nfsd
   - run 2.3 or 2.4 (either userspace or kernelmode)
Hints very much appreciated!
(as is a CC to my emailaddress)
Regards
Ivo Janssen
