ata_scsi_translate() in libata-scsi.c, in between the call to 
ata_scsi_qc_new() and ata_qc_issue().
something like:
	if (ata_scsi_qc_new() fails ||
	    (depth > 0 && ata_check_non_ncq_cmd()))
		complete SCSI command with 'queue full'
NOTE!
I just noticed a bug -- When ata_scsi_qc_new() fails, the code should 
complete the command with queue-full, but does not.
         qc = ata_scsi_qc_new(ap, dev, cmd, done);
         if (!qc)
                 return;
