I'm fairly confident that in your case, unlike Jay's,
memtest86 will soon show you're suffering from bad memory.
Those swap_free warnings suggest single-bit and double-bit memory errors;
which are likely to be responsible for all the rest of your symptoms.
It's natural that such errors will sometimes appear as swap_free warnings
and sometimes as rmap.c BUGs.  Increasingly it seems that the rmap.c BUG
is quite a good indicator of bad memory (though not necessarily so).  But
it concerns me that we don't see nearly so many swap_free warnings, which
should be nearly as common if bad memory were the sole cause.
