Subject: [PATCH]: -mm tree remove __exit from loop_exit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Andrew, please patch ASAP as compile on SGI ia64 is broken.  Please note this
patch does not address why modpost did not pick up this error.
ie) ./scripts/mod/modpost drivers/block/built-in.o yields no information about
the section mismatch.  AFAIK, it should spit out a loud WARNING.
Patch against 2.6.22-rc3-mm1.
Current mm tree does not build with sn2_defconfig.  Build results in error:
`.exit.text' referenced in section `.init.text' of drivers/built-in.o: defined in discarded section `.exit.text' of drivers/built-in.o
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
__exit loop_exit is now being called from __init loop_init which causes this error.
