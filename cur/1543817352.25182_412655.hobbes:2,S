Linus and Jens,
Stephen Rothwell just pointed me at the new splice() interface. Looks
really nice!
One comment though. Could we add a off_t to splice to make it more
like pwrite() ? Otherwise threads could get painful with race
conditions between the seek and the splice() call.
Either that or add psplice() like this:
  ssize_t psplice(int fdin, int fdout, size_t len, off_t ofs, unsigned flags);
where ofs sets the offset to read from fdin. 
Cheers, Tridge
