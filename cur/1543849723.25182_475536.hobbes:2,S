What if "next" became NULL afterwards? I know it's unlikely (but so is
the whole bug, given that we have just one reporter despite the bug's
age), but is it impossible? IOW does sysfs_readdir have any indirect
mutex protection?
Dave, do you patch sysfs datatypes in FC's kernel, or types they include?
