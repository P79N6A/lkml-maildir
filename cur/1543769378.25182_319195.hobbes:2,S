I know the patch because it went from Andrea to me to Andrew to Linus.
I have a copy of the 2.6.N trees here on my laptop so can quickly
verify my recollection that the first 2.6.N it appeared in was 2.6.7.
Then I searched through each ChangeLog-2.6.7-rcN at
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/
for comments on get_user_pages.
