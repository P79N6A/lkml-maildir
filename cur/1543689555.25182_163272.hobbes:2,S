I should point out that this is not because we actually have PCI
devices that don't respond to function 0, which would be contrary to
the PCI spec.  What is happening here is that with logical
partitioning on ppc64 boxes, we can have function 0 of a PCI-PCI
bridge assigned to one partition and function 2 (for example) assigned
to a different partition.  On the second partition it looks like
function 2 exists but function 0 doesn't (since we can't access it).
Paul.
