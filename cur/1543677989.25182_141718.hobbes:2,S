As far as I can tell, it is as clear as it could be... First option
is named 'G100/G200/G400/G450/G550' support, while second is named
'G100/G200/G400'.

fbset is not supported on 2.5.x kernels for setting console resolution.
If you want same environment you had in 2.4.x, get patch from
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest.

No surprise... But I doubt that it is matroxfb's problem.
