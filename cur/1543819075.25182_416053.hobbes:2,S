I don't really understand it yet.
Yes, please resend and feel free to a) add comments in places where we can
help people to understand the code and b) convert any code which gets
touched to be coding-style-friendly.  (I usually recommend that we do that
even if the surrounding code uses different conventions - eventually
everything will be fixed ;))
