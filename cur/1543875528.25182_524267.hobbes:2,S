What follows is a clean major iteration of the (now) Staircase Deadline cpu 
scheduler.
Changes from RSDL v0.33:
- All accounting is moved to tasks in nanosecond resolution removing 
requirement for Rotation component entirely
- list_splice_tail is no longer required; dropped
- Nicer nice with smaller rr_intervals if HZ tolerates it
- Reworked SCHED_BATCH to keep same cpu bandwidith but lax latency
- Updated documentation
Patches that follow are for 2.6.21-rc5
Andrew please use these to replace the RSDL patches.
