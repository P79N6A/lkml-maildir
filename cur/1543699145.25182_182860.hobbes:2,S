Sure.  
And if you want to run this way with udev, set it up so device nodes
don't get deleted when the device unloads.  That way you keep
device nodes for your driverless devices, and when you try to open
them the kernel runs modprobe for you.  Devfs isn't needed for that
afaik, it is only needed for modprobing devices that doesn't have
a /dev entry yet.
Your /dev will contain nodes both for driven and non-driven
devices, but not for devices you don't have at all.
