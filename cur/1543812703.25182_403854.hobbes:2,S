Not an direct outstanding issue, but more a TODO.
The section mismatch check that is now part of a regular kernel build
(in -mm) detected a number of cases with inconsistency in __devinit
versus __init usage. Some are still outstanding and needs to be fixed.
The natural next step is to extend the check to cover __devinit,
__devinitdata so we to some extent knows things are consistent should
someone decide to build a kernel without hotplug enabled.
The task is simple enough:
Add a new section for __devinit, __devinitdata
Add consistency check in modpost.
I took a short look at it, but done right stuff from vmlinux.lds ought
to be consolidated in asm-generaic/vmlinux.lds.h, but my head started
spinning when I went through the different $(ARCH)/kernel/vmlinux.lds
files.
2.6.18 material - we are not in a hurry.
Fixes for the warnings always generated are 2.6.17 material if people
start fixing them soon (when the check hits mainline I assume this will
happen).

Useful - maybe. But indeed interesting reading (also the USB part).
