I read the rest of the thread and I noticed various quotations starting with
13.xx which I do not see in the dump you attached.
Err... where is everyone reading the tcpdump from? What you sent in the
beginning finishes at 14.24? And I do not see scanning there. In it there are
few thing still:
Broken network. See below:
14:22:28.349230 chaos.analogic.com.who > 204.178.47.255.who: udp 84
The response is broken network/OS: 
1. 10.x.x.x es return broadcasts sent to 204.178.47.255. These are on a
different network. Unless I am wrong you are not supposed to return anything to
a broadcast that does not match any of your interfaces broadcast IP addresses.
2. If NT goes bananas on rwhod it is indeed interesting because it is 100% unix
specific.
Richard, can you remove rwhod from startup and see if any of the NTs still
suffer sudden urges to lose sanity?
