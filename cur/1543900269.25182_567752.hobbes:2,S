Subject: posix lock_timer fails on tgid invalid

Hello,
On my uClinux nios platform I discovered the following bug:
Suppose the application has a thread, and in this thread the
timer_create function is called
Next in the main thread the timer_settime function is called.
Now, this function will always fail, in sys_settime a lock_timer
function is called.
This lock_timer function checks that timr->it_process->tgid equals
current->tgid else
the function fails. With two threads in the application, this check
always fails!!!
Note: the same code works fine on a desktop linux system. I already
reported this bug to the uClinux forum and the nios forum for a month.
So far, without any response.
Why is the check on tgid needed and why does it fail?
Greetings Gerrit
