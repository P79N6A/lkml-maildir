hrm... it seems the updates to olympic.c have rendered it DOA ;-{
I get an Oops on module loading, followed by a reboot - I've not
been able to trap the oops, but I recall that the EIP was 0x10 (invalid)
The only candidates (it was a trivially small patch) seem to be:
the two additions:  dev->last_rx = jiffies ; I'll bet that at least
one of those points that dev is null (and it must be the first one
because the second seems to be in an #ifdef that shouldn't be triggered.

Perhaps the RBLing (Realtime Black Hole) of msn.com recently, which
prevented a large amount of mail going out for about 4 days, has had a
positive influence in Redmond.  They did agree to work on their anti-relay
capabilities at their POPs to get the RBL lifted.
