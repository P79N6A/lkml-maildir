I didn't miss the point, but I guess I should have made that clear too.
The number of tasks seen running on that sibling is still the same even if the 
queue is forced to be idle (witness by top thinking the load is 1 on that 
sibling even if it also shows quite a lot of idle time). It should therefore 
not attract any more tasks to itself. 
The task that is there will be trapped based on the fact that there is only 
one task _only_ if the other sibling is indefinitely running real time tasks, 
and _if_ there are other physical cpus we can use we should try to schedule 
the trapped task away. If we have N physical cpus (and N*2 logical), and we 
are running N real time threads I don't think we should expect to run 
SCHED_NORMAL tasks as well. If we have <N real time tasks (where N > 1) then 
we should still be able to run SCHED_NORMAL tasks, I agree. I'm a little 
reluctant to tackle this at this stage with the number of SMP balancing 
things already queued for -mm, but making a sibling appear more heavily laden 
when "pegged" (nr_running + 1) should suffice.
