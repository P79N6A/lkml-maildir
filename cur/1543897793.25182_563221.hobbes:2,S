Blam.

time_init() is called before slab is set up.  We cannot do memory
allocations inside time_init().

hrm.  Looks like none of your testers have HPET_ID_LEGSUP hardware.  This:
--- a/arch/i386/kernel/hpet.c~a
+++ a/arch/i386/kernel/hpet.c
@@ -376,7 +376,7 @@ int __init hpet_enable(void)
 
 	clocksource_register(&clocksource_hpet);
 
-	if (id & HPET_ID_LEGSUP) {
+	if (0 && (id & HPET_ID_LEGSUP)) {
 		hpet_enable_int();
 		hpet_reserve_platform_timers(id);
 		/*

gets it working.  It basically nobbles the hpet and the kernel chose the
TSC clocksource instead.
btw, if you want to know why I go on and on about crappy commenting, try to
work out from the kernel source code what HPET_ID_LEGSUP is, and why it
gets special treatment.  It is not possible.  This is not maintainable
code.
