The problem with 2.3.51 was that it started balancing
the HIGHMEM zone before falling back.
On a 1GB system this lead not only to the system starting
to swap as soon as the 128MB highmem zone was filled up,
it also resulted in the other 900MB being essentially
unused.
Having your 1GB system running as if it had 128MB definately
can be classified as Not Fun.
