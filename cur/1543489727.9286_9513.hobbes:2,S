Is the Oops in your syslog files?  Probably /var/log/syslog, hunt
through /var/log files.  Sometimes an Oops does not get logged because
the machine is so badly affected that syslog does not run.  Then you
have to copy the data from the screen into a file by hand or use a
serial console (Documentation/serial-console.txt) and capture the
console output on another machine.

Documentation/oops-tracing.txt says
Quick Summary
-------------
cd /usr/src/linux/scripts/ksymoops
make ksymoops
./ksymoops < the_oops.txt
and send the output the maintainer of the kernel area that seems to be
involved with the problem.
scripts/ksymoops/README says
  Note:   Unless you tell ksymoops *NOT* to read a particular file, it
          will try to read and reconcile almost all possible sources of kernel
          symbol information.  This is intended for beginners, they just
          type
            ksymoops < /var/log/syslog
          no thinking required.
So you could try what the documentation says.
