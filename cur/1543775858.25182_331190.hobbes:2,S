Subject: kernel 2.6: NFS problem---cannot rmmod nfsd

I compile kernel 2.6.11.10 and configure both nfs client and server as
kernel modules.  But after I reboot the machine and did
"/etc/init.d/nfs start", the nfsd module is inserted. But when I tried
to rmmod this module either with "/etc/init.d/nfs stop" or "umount
/proc/fs/nfsd; rmmod nfsd",  the nfsd reference count is always 1 and
cannot be removed.  Why?
Thanks in advance for your kind help!
