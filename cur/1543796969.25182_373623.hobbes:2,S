Yes, that is the memory barrier in rcu_assign_pointer.

Fortunately the radix tree never needs to do anything like this.
It doesn't move nodes or subtrees - the only modification operations
needed are to insert and delete items (ignoring the tag operations,
which are done under lock).

It can return either. It is up to the reader to do the right thing
in either case (which will need a note in the API comments).
