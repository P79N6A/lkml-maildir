  Jeff,
	I have a feeling you're talking about this section:
>  pci_write_config_byte (pdev, PCI_CACHE_LINE_SIZE, cls);
>  pci_read_config_word (pdev, PCI_COMMAND, &pcr);
>
>  /* Turn off Fast B2B enable */
>  pcr &= ~PCI_COMMAND_FAST_BACK;
>  /* Turn on SERR# enable and others */
>  pcr |= (PCI_COMMAND_SERR | PCI_COMMAND_INVALIDATE | PCI_COMMAND_PARITY |
>          PCI_COMMAND_IO   | PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY);
>
>  pci_write_config_word (pdev, PCI_COMMAND, pcr);
>  pci_read_config_word (pdev, PCI_COMMAND, &pcr);
  Basically, this section exists from a time when I had no idea why the
card was behaving badly, so I was trying everything :-).
  So, after revisiting them, I see that setting cache line size to 0 and
then using memory write and invalidate doesn't make any sense.  I'm thinking 
both can just be dropped, since I haven't seen any change in performance on 
the machines I've made netperf runs with (a constant 14.7 Mb/s) after 
changing these.
  Any thoughts?
Kent
