Jan-Bernd Themann,
                  IMO, a box must be aware of the speed of all its
interfaces, whether the
                  interface impliments tail-drop or RED or XYZ, the latency
to access the
                  packet, etc.
                  Then when a packet arrives, a timer is started for
interrupt colelesing,
                  and to process awaiting packets, if tail-drop is
implemented, it is
                  possible to wait until a the input FIFO fills to a
specific point before
                  starting a timer.
                  This may maximize the number of packets per interupt. And
realize that
                  the worse case of a interrupt per packet is wirespeed
pings (echo
                  request/reply) of 64 bytes per packet.
