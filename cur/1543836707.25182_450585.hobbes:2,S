No warning, but you still want the cast...
On PPC and ARM that will work fine, since char is unsigned.
But on most other platforms char is signed, and contrary to popular belief,
`%02x' doesn't mean `limit this field to 2 characters', so it would print e.g.
ffffffff instead of ff for -1.

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
