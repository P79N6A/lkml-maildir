I would say that RSDL is probably a bit better than default for server 
use, although if the server starves for CPU interactive processing at 
the console becomes leisurely indeed. The only thing I would like to 
address is the order of magnitude blips in latency of nice processes, 
which may be solved by playing with time slices. Con hasn't really 
commented on that (or I haven't read down to it).

I don't think that RSDL and -rt should be merged, but that's for Ingo 
and Con to discuss. I would love to see RSDL in mainline as soon as it 
is practical, marked as EXPERIMENTAL.

I don't think there are a lot of places where it underperforms the 
default scheduler, and it avoids a lot of jackpot cases where an 
overloaded system really bogs down. I would like to see more varied 
testing before any changes are made, unless a simple change would 
improve consistency of latency.
