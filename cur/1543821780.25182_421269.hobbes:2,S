You can try this but don't believe it will change your outcome. I've
booted this on ia64 with slight modification to eliminate
VIRTUAL_MEM_MAP and have only DISCONTIGMEM. Your case is failing at the
front edge of of the zone and not the ending edge which had a flaw in my
first post of the patch. I would have expected the first patch to handle
the front edge correctly.
I don't remember seeing your .config in the thread (or blind and unable
to see it). Would you please send it my way.
I'm also hoping Andy has time to look into this.
