Looks like you've got it after all! With the patch in the correct place 
there are no more skips and I now get:
/proc/5182/task/5182/sched:se.bonus_max  :        39.960966
/proc/5182/task/5263/sched:se.bonus_max  :        39.960966
/proc/5182/task/5267/sched:se.bonus_max  :        39.960966
/proc/5182/task/5268/sched:se.bonus_max  :        39.960966
/proc/5182/task/5269/sched:se.bonus_max  :        39.960966
/proc/5182/task/5270/sched:se.bonus_max  :        19.990234
/proc/5182/task/5661/sched:se.bonus_max  :        39.960966
Note (mostly for Parag) that I had GROUP_SCHED disabled for these tests, but 
for me that did make not any difference with my 2.6.25-rc tests for this 
issue, nor with my tests using sched-devel earlier in the .26 merge window.
Feel free to add my
