Actually, they send out keycodes (Kinda obvious, if they didn't windoze
coudn't us them either.
On debian in /etc/kbd, I added this to default.map.gz:
keycode 125 = Last_Console
keycode 126 = Decr_Console
keycode 127 = Incr_Console
125 = left window key
126 = right window key
127 = menu key
In X I have these keys setup differently.  right window key is another 'alt'
key.  the left window key is front/back (ie: sun), the menu key is just
that, the root menu.
