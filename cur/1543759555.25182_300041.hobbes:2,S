2.6.3-mm1 'dm-crypt vs. cryptoloop' discussion was some time ago, it is
time to bring this up again:
http://kerneltrap.org/node/2433
I'm no cryptanalyst, but googling a bit shows a bunch of problems with
it (also see above thread), there is no maintainer and most importantly
there is a replacement for it that has active maintainers. Redundant
security solutions is a risky thing to me.
