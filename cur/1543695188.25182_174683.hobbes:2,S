There is no 2.6 version of kgdb currently. The 2.4 version also has some
problems that makes it better to not use it at all.
My plan was to do a fresh port from the code in -mm* and get rid of 
many of the ugly hacks in 2.4. Doing this properly requires adding
dwarf2 annotation to entry.S and other assembly files. This would
allow to get rid of the "interrupt threads" hack in 2.4 because gdb
could directly backtrace through exception/interrupts.
