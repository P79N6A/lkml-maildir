I am having a similar problem writing to NFS mounted non-linux system on
kernels past 2.4.20-pre3.  I get an input/output error while writing.  I
have sent email to Trond Myklebust (who made the changes between pre3 and
pre4).  And he said to switch to using the TCP protocol for mounts.  That
worked, but I should not have to do that because
1. It worked to 2.4.20pre3 without a problem
2. Other OSes such as FreeBSD do not have issues writing to other OSes using
UDP soft mounts.
To me, there is something wrong with the changes that went in in 2.4.20pre4,
it should work as it does in pre3 and/or other unix OSes such as FreeBSD. 
We should not have to work around the problem with hard links or using TCP
instead of UDP.
