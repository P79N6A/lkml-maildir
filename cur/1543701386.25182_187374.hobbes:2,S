One thing that I'm confused about with respect to device files is how
kernel arguments are supposed to work. Now, we _seem_ to have a
mish-mash of different ways to tell the kernel which device to open as
a console, which device to use as a suspend device, etc.... Now, all
of the device names are being migrated to userland. How is the kernel
supposed to determine which device to use when it is told use
/dev/hda3 or /dev/ide/host0/something/part3 as the suspend partition?
The kernel no longer knows to which device this string this device is
connected.
(I have not looked into how these parameters are parsed; this is pure
speculation)
One solution that I see if the device names are totally removed from
the kernel is specifying these parameters as sysfs paths. Would this
work? Or is there a better way?
