It makes some sense, but I don't think OOM is something that
occurs often enough to care about it /that/ much...
My algorithm is already complex enough for my tastes (but seems
to work quite well in the sense that it usually picks the "right"
process in one shot and kills the process the user expects to be
killed).

Rik
