My version doesn't have this problem by default, because it saves a full image 
of memory unless the user explicitly sets a (soft) upper limit on the image 
size. The image is stored as contiguously as available storage allows, so 
rereading it quickly isn't so much of an issue (and far less of an issue than 
discarding the memory before suspending and faulting it back in from all over 
the place afterwards).
That said, work has already been done along the lines that you're describing. 
You might, for example, look at the OLS papers from last year. There was a 
paper there describing work on almost exactly what you're describing.
Hope that helps.
