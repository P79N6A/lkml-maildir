Alternatively, we could provide a new primitive -
size_t safe_memcpy(void *to, void *from, size_t size);
Semantics: copy byte-by-byte until we either get 'size' bytes or trigger an
exception.  Return the number of bytes copied.
Obvious implementation via __get_user() would be default, overridable by
architecture...
