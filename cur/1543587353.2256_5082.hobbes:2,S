I thought I had seen at least one other complaint on l-k about seeing the
problem in text mode.

Yes, sorry I didn't make this clear.  I have a Matrox G400.

Exactly.  That is what I'm saying.  I've seen the problem with the
returning to VESA text modes from XFree 4.0 anytime I use the hallib, with
2.2 and 2.4 kernels.  If I compile an X server without the hallib it's
fine (G450 users don't have that option, and I like my dual head).
If X changes the mode upon starting it should put it back when it is done.
