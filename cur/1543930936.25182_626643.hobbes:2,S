... because too much is pushed out. This isn't a mathematica problem,
there's more than one solution to this problem. Throttling the bio count
is one.

Here we go again, thanks for picking up your jerky attitude again. I'm
trying to suggest a way to get the patch in a state to be included, but
apparently you are not interested. With 3 bugs so far exposed in your
really short patch, seems you should take all the testing help you can
get.
For what it's worth, your behind the doors testing is worth basically
nothing. It's already been shown that your test coverage wasn't very
wide, if this patch/idea is to have any hope of proceeding further you
need user testing. Period.
Stop cc'ing or replying, what little interest I had is totally gone.
