Um, really? I've never seen this before...but then again I'm not a 
native english speaker, but I still find it annoying...hm, but that's no

The indentation of this file is...."interesting" and I did not dare to 
touch it, I thought it had some special meaning....
Anyway, I'll return to more important issues then, maybe Ingo just want 
to scratch one of the "level" explanations, this *is* confusing. But

documented and now I know what this debian-checkarray script was up 
to...
Thanks,
Christian
