Through a very painful procedure I got w98 installed and bumped my 
firmware revision. The filename of the installation binary was 
duw1608_r108.exe suggesting R1.08 but the windows screen mentioned
that the bumping was from 060 to 080 or thereabouts...
At any rate, now everything seems to work as it should, using the 
ide-cd driver. That you all for the help!
Cheers,
/Anders
