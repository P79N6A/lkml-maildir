[1.] Once I get the loading the kernel message from Lilo I hard crash without any error
messages.
[2.] I had no trouble making the bzImage and have installed it made it and installed it
three different times from scratch, once using debian's make-kpkg tool, but still I get
the same outcome - a hard crash with no error messages. I get the Loading
Linux.2.4.1........... ok,now booting the kernel and then BANG, I go dead with no error
message of any kind.

nothing. Thanks for any help.
