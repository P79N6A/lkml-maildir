Please don't do it this way.
This is quite possibly faster even _normally_, so it might make more sense 
to just do it globally instead of having a CONFIG_NEX_SMALL.
Basically, inline functions tend to win only when inlining them is smaller
and simpler than actually calling a function. The most common cause of
that is that some argument is commonly constant (and thus gets simplified
away by inlining), or the function itself literally expands to just a few 
instructions (the list functions, the inline asms for things like "cli" 
etc).
We use a lot too many inline functions for other reasons: one reason to 
use them is that they are sometimes more convenient than it is to find a 
good place for the non-inline version. Another common reason is that the 
thing started out smaller than it eventually became - and the inline just 
stuck around.
But if you do things like this for a CONFIG_SMALL, then the convenience 
argument obviously isn't true any more, and you'd be a lot better off just 
unconditionally making it a real function call.
Function calls aren't all that expensive, especially with FASTCALL() etc 
to show that you don't have to follow the common calling conventions. 
Right now I think FASTCALL() only matters on x86, but some other 
architectures could make it mean "smaller call clobbered list" or similar.
Have you benchmarked with the smaller kernel?
