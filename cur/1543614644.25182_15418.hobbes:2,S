Could work, but there are some bits that have no maintainer as such,
eg, the pci irq routing. There have been several interested parties
hacking on it however. A means of having people add themselves to the
list would be a 'must have' feature.

Having a mapping from kernel source filename -> email address would
still be preferred personally.
$ cclist devfs
is really not much of an improvement over
$ grep -C3 -i devfs MAINTAINERS
Other than the addition of extra 'interested, cc me too' people.
The only problem with my original idea is that its a pita to keep
up to date. kernel files get added and removed on a weekly (sometimes
daily) basis. Whoever is dumb^Wwonderful enough to volunteer to
maintain such a database is likely to have their work cut out for
them, so maybe your module idea is preferable.
Hmmm..
Dave.
