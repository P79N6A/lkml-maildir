That is nonsense - rebasing loses a lot of history: it loses the precise 
place of the commit and re-anchors the commit to another place. It hides the 
cases where you did conflict resolution in a rebase, and it also hides the 
cases where Git auto-merged something. It makes it hard to trust the dates 
in the tree because literally, according to the timestamps, the tree you 
sent me was just a few hours hold.
We dont ever rebase maintainer Git trees - only in the most exceptional 
circumstances. Rebasing is fine for certain situations during development, 
but it is considered evil as a maintenance model.

Have you considered to _take a look_ at the commit i pointed out to you? The 
commit does this:

This commit _only adds a comment_. We fixed the ioremap bug upstream eons 
ago (when you pointed it out), and you probably did a conflict resolution in 
a rebase and then perhaps forgot about this.

Yes, this is one of the typical dangers of rebasing. Besides losing true 
history, you also risk mishaps like that.
That is why the kernel maintainer 101 is: "never rebase". I'm surprised you 
never even heard about that... Does this mean that you frequently rebase the 
SCSI tree?

The format i suggested above would be fine.

What development kernels are they using? I never heard any bugreport from

Regarding the changes in the x86/apic branch, see this thread in your lkml 
folder:
  x86: unify genapic code, unify subarchitectures, remove old subarchitecture code
  
http://lwn.net/Articles/317050/
  
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/786890
With 114 patches submitted to lkml. (there's ~10 more in the works that i'll 
submit to lkml once i'm happy with them)
All patches to the x86 tree are submitted to lkml (including my patches and 
that of other maintainers) and all development is done there.
So i dont get it how you can claim it credibly that you cannot take part in 
x86 development.

Nice rant which ignores the fact that i submitted those patches to lkml.

Well, the #ifdef hack you did is out of question. The clean approach would 
be to remove the acpi.h include from asm/fixmap.h and fix the dependency 
fallout. The hack you did deepens the spaghetti and makes it 
config-conditional as well - which is even worse than plain header 
dependency mess and which is a step backwards.
