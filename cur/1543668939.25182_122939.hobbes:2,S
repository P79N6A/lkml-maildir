	From: Andreas Behnert <abehn@gmx.net>
	Yesterday I installed an external RAID system, machine
	was running kernel 2.2.20 and everything worked ok:
	~snip~
	  SCSI device sdb: hdwr sector= 512 bytes. Sectors=1278558208
	  [624296 MB] [624.3 GB]
	~snip~
	Then I compiled 2.4.21-pre7:
	~snip~
	  SCSI device sdb: 1278558208 512-byte hdwr sectors (-444889 MB)
	~snip~
	The system *seems* to work ok but I don't know if it really
	*does* - I didn't want to experiment very much because the
	RAID array contains sensitive data
Yes, this is a frequent complaint.
Nothing is wrong, only the message.
It is fixed by the patch below.
