I general I would rather just fix things as they break.  i.e. when you
change a line that violates the style, fix it then.
And some of the changes you make, I don't like.  e.g. Everything
inside parentheses should be to the right of the opening parenthesis.

This refactoring, however, is a good idea.  We have some very deep
functions in there and breaking them out is a good idea.  So a patch
that just does this would be very welcome.

Good idea...  Am I asking too much to have separate things in separate
patches?  It makes review easier.

I guess...  though moving the documentation away from the code means
that it is less likely to be kept up-to-date.
