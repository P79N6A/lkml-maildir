Uhh oh, that's actually interresting and you are right on this point.
One should just add the functionality. If you dare to wait the weekend
it will happen in 2.5 ;-). Or of you care your self, then plase
have a look at the following code in 2.5.6-pre3 in ide-pci:
/*
  * Setup DMA transfers on a channel.
  */
static void __init setup_channel_dma(ide_hwif_t *hwif, struct pci_dev *dev,
                 ide_pci_device_t *d,
                 int port,
                 u8 class_rev,
                 int pciirq, ide_hwif_t **mate,
                 int autodma, unsigned short *pcicmd)
{
         unsigned long dma_base;
         if (d->flags & ATA_F_NOADMA)
                 autodma = 0;
         if (autodma)
                 hwif->autodma = 1;
         if (!((d->flags & ATA_F_DMA) || ((dev->class >> 8) == 
PCI_CLASS_STORAGE_IDE && (dev->class & 0x80))))
                 return;
Would it be sufficient to just prevent the classes you mention to
bail out from initialization?

It can be fixed I think.
