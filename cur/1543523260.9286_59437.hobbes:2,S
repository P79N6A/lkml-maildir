Did you run an fsck(8) (preferrably from e2fsprogs-1.18 or later, earlier
ones sometimes crashed on the mess) on the filesystem? I've seen thrashed
filesystems here under similar circumstances (much file creating/deleting,
f.ex. compiling kernels) that looked fine, just to give hundreds of
problems (duplicate blocks, seemingly with deleted files; files that morph
into directories; hundreds of files in lost+found) when fsck(8)ing them later.

Same here. Various compilers and binutils. i686 UP, IDE disks.
