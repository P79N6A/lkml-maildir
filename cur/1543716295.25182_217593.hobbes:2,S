err... Seems I've send this to the wrong list.  
Sending to linux-kernel this time :)

Hi Andrew,
Could you consider this patch for inclusion into mainline kernel?  It 
alleviates some issues seen with Linux when accessing millions of files
on machines with large amounts of RAM (+32GB).  Both algorithms are base
on some studies that Dominique Heger was doing on hash table efficiencies
in Linux.  The dentry hash table has been tested in small systems with 
one internal IDE hard disk as well as in large SMP with many fiberchanel
disks.  Dominique claims that in all the testing done, they did not see
one case were this has function provided worst performance and that in
most test they were seeing better performance.
The inode hash function was done by me base on Dominique's original work
and has only been stress tested with SpecSFS.  It provided a 3% 
improvement over the default algorithm in the SpecSFS results and speed 
ups in the response time of almost all filesystem operations the benchmark
stress.  With the better distribution is as also possible to reduce the 
number of inode buckets for 32 million to 16 million and still get a slightly
better results.
Anton was nice enough to provide some graphs that show the distribution 
before and after the patch at
