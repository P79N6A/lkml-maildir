Making the kernel a bit smaller is a small improvement.
Runtime errors caused with gcc 3.4 are IMHO much worse than such a small 
improvement or three dozen compile errors with gcc 3.4 .
The effect of your patch with gcc 3.4 would be nearly:
  Ignore all old inlines and add something new that does what inline
  did before.
Wouldn't it be a better solution if you would audit the existing inlines 
in the kernel for abuse of inline and fix those instead?

My copy of compiler.h says:
<--  snip  -->
#if __GNUC__ > 3
# include <linux/compiler-gcc+.h>       /* catch-all for GCC 4, 5, etc. */
<--  snip  -->
What exactly is wrong with this?
