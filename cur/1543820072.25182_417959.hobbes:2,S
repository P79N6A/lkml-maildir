I don't think anyone should be calling kfree with NULL pointer often in
the first place. Keeping the extra check in place is masking the real
problem. So yeah, we should be looking at the NULL checks more carefully
to see if they require more fundamental fixes, but no, I don't see why
janitors can't continue to remove the extra checks.
