AFAIK the current interpretation suggests that you must keep it out of
the statically-linked kernel image.  This would tend to imply using an
initrd image for critical modules which can't be GPL'd.
It has also been mentioned that you could shove all non-GPL'd binary
code into a special ELF section of the static kernel image, and
similarly satisfy the GPL 'separate work' clause.
Standard IANL / IANAL disclaimers apply.
