Subject: [COMMENTS IDE 2.5] - "idebus=66" in 2.5.8 results in "ide_setup: idebus=66 -- BAD OPTION"

Hey Martin (and the rest of you)
Been testing 2.5.8 for an hour or so, and noticed the following :
[11:14][root@sexything:/home/admin]$ dmesg | grep idebus
Kernel command line: BOOT_IMAGE=2.5.8-without-TCQ ro root=303 video=matrox:vesa:0x118 idebus=66 profile=2
ide_setup: idebus=66 -- BAD OPTION
With 2.5.8-pre3 :
[11:15][root@sexything:/home/admin]$ cat ./IDEBUS
Kernel command line: BOOT_IMAGE=2.5.8-pre3 ro root=303 video=matrox:vesa:0x118 idebus=66 profile=2
ide_setup: idebus=66
Now, I do not know the reasons for changing the code that handles "idebus=" stuff in ide.c (except from the fact
that it now looks cleaner :) - just thought I should let you know. I do not have the time right now to hunt down
the bug(?) and cook up a patch, but if you want me to, I`ll do it later today. 
One more thing, Martin - I compiled a 2.5.8 with TCQ enabled (yep, I`m aware of the fact that this one is _really_ alpha :), 
and tested it for, oh ... 10 minutes ... the system gave me all sorts of funny responses - segfaults, 
"inconsistency in ld.so" and so on ... would you like me to collect 'funnies' and send them to you ? If so, just 
give me a hint.
