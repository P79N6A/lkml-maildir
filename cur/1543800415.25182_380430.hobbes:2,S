Sounds very strange to me that by changing a base-10 integer into base-16 
does not execute the branch anymore...

Well, I can tell you even more: I also have an ISA LPT expansion card in an 
ol 386 that gets assigned 278 and 3BC respectively.

I have not yet checked the BIOS POST message of the i686 where
the PCI LPT card is in... maybe it's just Linux that remaps
it to high ports. Gotta test it in Windows. BBL.
Anyway, as for the patch I think you should walk down the list of 
already-collected ioports (in userspace that would equal to `grep parport 
/proc/ioports`) and assign each of them consecutive device names.
