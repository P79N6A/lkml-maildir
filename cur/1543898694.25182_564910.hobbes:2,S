Well, I don't either, because we don't freeze processes on
powerbooks.  But I have heard that other people have problems with
suspending with a fuse filesystem mounted.  Maybe the difference is
whether or not the filesystem is writable?

It's not the filesystem sync method, as I understand it, it's that if
there are dirty pages in the page cache for files on the fuse
filesystem, the system will initiate a write-out on them and wait for
it to finish.  But if the fuse userspace is frozen, the write-out will
never complete.
