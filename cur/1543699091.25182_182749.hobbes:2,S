You have 15 floppy devices connected to your box?  All floppy devices
should show up in /sys/block.

Patch for sysfs support for this has been posted by Hanna Linder.  It
still needs work before being added to the kernel tree.

Patch for this has been posted by me to lkml in the past.  It will
probably go into 2.6.1

Hanna Linder is working on a patch for these devices.

probably go into 2.6.1.

I have a patch here from Leann Ogasawara that adds sysfs support for
these devices.  I've been lacking time to test it better, but again, it
will probably make it into 2.6.1.

Hm, good catch.  I wonder why these aren't getting picked up in
/sys/class/tty as they are tty devices.  I thought they used to be
there...

You mean s/udev/devfs/ right?  :)

There is a udev config file that was just posted to linux-hotplug-devel
that supports a lot of devfs names.  If there are any missing that you
use, please post a config file for them.
Remember, I don't use devfs, so I really don't care about a udev mapping
for it :)

Hm, 2?  And one of them (Mandrake) got smart and went back...

Why not?  It's the standard afterall.  Remember, the devfs users are in
the tiny minority here.

Regardless of the state of udev, devfs has insolvable problems and you
should not use it.  End of story.
