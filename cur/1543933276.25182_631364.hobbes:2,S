Yes, I know all this.  I am quite aware of the situation.
My core assertion:  the present situation -- turning off MMCONFIG 
aggressively -- is greatly preferable to adding 
pci_enable_mmconfig_accesses(pdev).
IOW, don't add a new API.  Keep doing what we're doing today.
Today, we have a consistent "all or none" model for mmconfig.  Any 
per-device mmconfig enabling introduces pain and inconsistency, in both 
the kernel and userland.
Users with devices that REQUIRE extended config accesses should buy 
machines with known good mmconfig.  The situation will sort itself out 
from there.  We don't need ugly hacks like 
pci_enable_mmconfig_for_this_device().
