I think the dislike is justified.  XFS is kind of like an alien parasite 
attached to Linux.  IRIX's IO system is different, it's taken a lot of 
changes.  I still think it is the best filesystem with a lot of unused 
potential though.  I hope it will eventually be well integrated - 
2.6/2.8.  It's only the generic code changes we need to worry about 
though, right?
Regards,
Jeremy Jackson
