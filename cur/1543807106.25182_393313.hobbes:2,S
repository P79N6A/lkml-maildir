So what?  What does that have to do with my rebutting your statement 
that O_EXCL prevents multiple cdrecords?  O_EXCL also does not prevent 
you from kicking the plug out of the wall while burning, but it DOES 
prevent another process from trying to mess with the drive while 
cdrecord is and clobbering things up, which is a good thing.  It does 
not prevent you from using cdrecord at the same time on different drives.
