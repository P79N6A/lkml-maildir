How do you know this is the reason for the lost SYN?  What if other
things caused the SYN to be dropped by some intermediate site?
All the workarounds for ECN blackholes violate the protocol and
cause more problems than they solve.
That is why we refuse to implement them, and this is why the ECN
RFCs mark the "suggested workarounds" as optional not required to
implement.
