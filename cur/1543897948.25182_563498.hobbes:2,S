No, it's correct. It simply says that this code can only be discarted 
after initialization if it's not a module, since it's also used from 
__exit code.
The idea behind __init_or_module is that __exit code is never executed 
for non-modular code, and such cases where some function is executed 
both by both __init and __exit and never from other code aren't that 
unusual.
I'm not sure how realistic it is, but it would be best if we could at 
some point in the future simply give gcc a few basic hints that stuff 
like module_init() can use code that is __init and let gcc figure out 
which code to move to this section...
