When attempting to compile 2.2.14pre8 for my Motorola BlackHawk PReP
PowerPC box, I received, rougly "keyboard.c, handle_scancode line 232:
struct ppc_md has no member ppc_kbd_sysrq_xlate".
The member is initialized only in gemini_setup.c and used in a #define in
keyboard.h.
Replacing both occurrences of ppc_md.ppc_kbd... with ppc_md.kbd_... fixes
compile and brings it in line with other PPC archs. We'll see how it
boots.  Missed patch?  
Hmm... why is gemini even being touched for PReP?
