Sorry, no.  Or not without difficulty, anyway.  The problem is that a
boot parameter would have to specify which EHCI controller it applied
to (some computers have more than one), which complicates things.

If you control the contents of the CD then perhaps you can include the
necessary command as part of an initrd script.
Another thought occurred: These problems may well be the result of 
interference from an SMI BIOS.  Check your BIOS settings and see if 
there's anything which can be disabled, or see if there's a BIOS update 
available.
This particular failure mode is not amenable to automatic handling, 
since there is no simple way to distinguish it from a valid usage 
(someone plugging in a device and then unplugging it).
If somebody is motivated enough, they might add code to detect too many
connect-change events occurring on a port in a limited period of time.  
This would require storing a fair amount of extra information for each
port on each USB hub.  Then you would still need some sort of interface
for the automatic speed reduction.  It could be done, but I don't want
to work on it.
