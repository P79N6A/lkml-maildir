The patents have been filed for over a year, and will publish in several 
weeks at uspto.gov -- that's the only acclaim I care for --
one that results in value for the industry and more patent protection 
for Linux and profits for folks.  No, I have not been invited
to the summit, probably because of the lawsuit I filed against some 
folks who were threatening my family -- Peter Anvin booted
me off Kernel.org after allowing folks to pinch my code and copy my bash 
history files all over the internet, and several folks
have stiffed me.  I could care less.  I keep creating cool technology, 
make tons of money off of it, and I have cultivated an
excellent relationship with the Wikimedia Foundation, and I am now the 
principal contributor on the Cherokee Wikipedia.  Wales
even deleted the article folks had used to smear me and made folks 
rewrite it.  Wales is a very nice man and good dude.
I am content to contribute to Linux from a business viewpoint, and if 
the treatment I received from Anvin is par for kernel.org accounts,
I don't care for one -- IP addresses are rather cheap on the 
internet.    I was and have remained loyal to Linux through it all.
I am appreciative of your interest.  Check uspto.gov in next few weeks 
for published applications, it's all described there, distributed
architecture and all. 
All my Wikilove.
Jeff
