I'm running ubuntu 8.10, with 2 custom kernels 2.6.28 and 2.6.29-rc2.
I've done a little bit more testing. This time with 4 version of firefox 
(3.0.5-ubuntu, 3.0.4, 3.1.b2, 3.2.a1) straight from mozilla.org, except 
the ubuntu one.
What I found is that all versions crash when loading iGoogle, sofar the 
only site that makes it crash, except 3.2a1.
Since iGoogle is my hompage, they all crash once loading is done (except 
3.2a1), unless I'm fast enough and load a different page.
But, _every_ version crashes if I go to Preferences->Main or 
Preferences->Applications.
None of this crashing happens if I'm booted into a .28 kernel, only on a 
.29-rc kernel.
Henceforth, I still think it's a kernel regression, but one that's going 
to be almost impossible to debug!
I've hit the most narrow minded bug on the planet! Very sad....
Seems like I always hit the undebugable regressions that nobody else 
sees ;-(
