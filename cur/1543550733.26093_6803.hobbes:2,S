Hello, I'm using a realtek 8029 (ne2k-pci) that sometimes hungs, it
stops working, nothing in the logs, no more interrupts, no respond to
either ip or arp.
ifdown & ifup don't solve it, neither rmmod insmod (ne2k-pci, 8390), and
BTW a 3c503 in the same machine continues to work ok (8390 based also).
So, a silent drop off the net and no other solution than a reboot.
