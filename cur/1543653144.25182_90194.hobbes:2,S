My point was that aesthetical reasons do not justify breaking anything
(aka forcing people to figure out what happened and spend time
recompiling).
Anyway, I'll need to recompile anyway, so I don't really care.

I proposed to fail in put_user for the parent tid simply because the old
code did it.
I'm not completely sure whether we should fail or not, but if put_user
fails something bad is happening, so it may be better to signal the
error rather than just continuing since it can be done easily (for the
parent tid).
