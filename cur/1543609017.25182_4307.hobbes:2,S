Both. /proc in ascii for shell scripts etc, and sysctl() in binary
for C programs and the like.
Something like
sysctl(SYSCTL_GET, "fs.file-max", SYSCTL_TYPE_INT, &val, sizeof(val))
It gets you free type checking as well.
Perhaps you even want a opendir()/getdents() type sysctl function
so you can walk the tree without /proc being mounted at all.
