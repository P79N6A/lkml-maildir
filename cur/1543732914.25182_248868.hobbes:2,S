so during page launder, we need to write to the filesystem, but if thats
in userspace there is the possibility the page launder could have been
caused in order that the filesystem daemon may run. AFAICS this problem
only arises when file is being written.
The only deadlock I can think of for read-only filesystems is if the
demon inadvertantly accesses one of the files that it is handling. That
could be avoided quite simply by preventing the demon from doing that in
the kernel.
I'm sure I'm missing something, I'd just like to know what ;)
