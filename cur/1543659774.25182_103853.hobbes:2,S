That only works if this kernel thread doesn't schedule.
If you schedule, you'd end up with multiple processes
wanting to use the same pool, or with a process moving
from one pool to the other (without the ability to
take its data with it).

I'm doubtful, but if you think you know a way to pull
it off I'm curious to see it ...
