FWIW, I ran a hugepage+O_DIRECT read test, that will cause the direct-io
code to hit set_page_dirty() for a compound page - and it works fine for
me. The fio job file used was:
[global]
directory=/data1
bs=4k
direct=1
hugepage-size=4m
iomem=shmhuge
[iothread]
filename=testfile
size=128m
rw=read
Test box is a lowly x86.
