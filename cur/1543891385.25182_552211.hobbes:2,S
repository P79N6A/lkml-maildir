But for this purpose the old kernel will actually need to do what is currently
done in swsusp while the image is being created (the only difference is that
we allocate memory in the process, but that's a detail only).

Besides, you need to load the new kernel somehow.  If that's to work without
problems, that should be done before we switch off devices.

Well, I don't quite agree.  I think that for this purpose we'll need devices to
be initialized from scratch by the new kernel, so the old kernel should put
them into states that allow this to be done.
We are going to implement something like this anyway, but that's a rather long
way to go.

Please see above.  I don't think that would be easy to arrange for.

You need to be cautious here.  You can't touch any filesystems mounted by
the old kernel, or they will be corrupted after the restore.

Yes, this applies to kernel threads and I agree with that, except that there
are kernel threads independent of any other tasks, so we don't need to worry
about them.

Well, I don't agree here.  My experience with the userland suspend is that such
things are generally very difficult for users to set up.

Well, we'd have to use a relocatable kernel for this purpose, it seems.

No, it can't do that, unless the file is on a 'safe' filesystem

I don't agree here.

Actually, I think we could restore in the same way as we do it right now,
if the image contained the right information (which I think it should anyway),
so that's not a big deal technically, but the current code would be needed
anyway.

Except when there's a problem to debug. ;-)
All in all, I think that the idea is worth considering, although the details
need to be clarified before we can try to implement it.
However, it really doesn't solve the basic problem that we have, which is
that we can't checkpoint filesystems easily.  That's why we freeze processes
in the first place and you're suggesting to replace this with another, equally
if not more complicated, mechanism.
I see two basic advantages of your approach:
1) We don't need to freeze tasks.
2) We can create images larger than 50% of RAM.
Still, I don't think we could implement it quickly and easily.
[And really, the freezing of tasks is not that horrible, although it may seem
so. ;-)]
