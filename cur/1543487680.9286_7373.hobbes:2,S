Dear lkml members,
the Linux IEEE-1394 (FireWire) Subsystem Development project has a new
homepage at
   
http://eclipt.uni-klu.ac.at/ieee1394
Development is going on, Developer Daniel reports IP-over-1394 working on
a point-to-point basis. 
If you are interested, download some code or just subscribe to the mailing
list.
I'll fly to LinuxWorldExpo tomorrow and will stay some time in the USA -
so please don't be annoyed when I don't answer any emails for some time.
Bye,
Greetings from Austria!
Emanuel
