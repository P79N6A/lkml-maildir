And is this really a problem?  The whole goal of the -stable tree was to
accomidate the users who relied on kernel.org kernels, and wanted
bugfixes and security updates.  It was not for new features or new
hardware support.
If people feel we should revisit this goal, then that's fine, and I have
no objection to that.  But until then, I think the rules that we have
had in place for over the past 2 years should still remain in affect.
thanks,
