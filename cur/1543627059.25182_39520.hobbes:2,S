This is actually the preferred way.  I must've misinterpeted what you said
earlier.  I believe this is actually a more generic way of handling.  A
thread package can specify the signal to used much in the way the current
LinuxThreads pre-allocates and uses certain real-time signals...

By keep with the original interface, we don't have to contend with this
problem.  The thread package can use the signal that most suits its'
implementation...
Make sense?
