I think that in windows, you simply install the "HP nx$FOOBAR intel graphics
driver" on a nx$FOOBAR machine, and the "ASUS $FOOBAR ATI graphics driver"
on an ASUS $FOOBAR machine etc. Those drivers are mostly stock intel/ATI/
whoever drivers, but with the little bit of extra knowledge on how to wake
up the graphics chip.
And there is no console mode in Windows. If you restrict yourself to
"it works from X", many machines do not need workarounds.

Ok. To be honest, you are the first reporter that seems to have read the
documentation above, but not understood what to do.
So i'll put it into even simpler steps:
 - get the current version of s2ram
 - boot your system with init=/bin/bash, mount /proc and /sys
 - try the s2ram options in the combinations listed on the above page
 - as soon as you find an option that works, please retry it from a
   full booted system (including X)
 - if it still works, please report the options used and the output of
   "s2ram -n" to the suspend-devel mailinglist.
i might consider reworking the documentation if there are more reports
about problems with the procedure.
