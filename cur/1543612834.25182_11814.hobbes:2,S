Linux definetly broken in this area! Linux (2.4) does not report other
any devices over either major 16 or minor 16. e.g. no /dev/hdb or /dev/hdd.
For my 4 IDE disk (on two different controllers) I only get:
disk_io: (3,0):(355075,157636,1744492,197439,2633848)
...
I'm thinking about fixing this on my onw using this patch as base:
