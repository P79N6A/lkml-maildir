Thanks for this excellent explanation. Things are much clearer now to
me. I just want to clarify one thing below:

Hmm ..so does sysctl_sched_granularity represents granularity in
real/wall-clock time scale then? AFAICS that doesnt seem to be the case.
__check_preempt_curr_fair() compares for the distance between the two
task's (current and next-to-be-run task) fair_key values for deciding
preemption point.
Let's say that to begin with, at real time t0, both current task Tc and next 
task Tn's fair_key values are same, at value K. Tc will keep running until its 
fair_key value reaches atleast K + 2000000. The *real/wall-clock* time taken 
for Tc's fair_key value to reach K + 2000000 - is surely dependent on N,
the number of tasks on the queue (more the load, more slowly the fair
clock advances)?
This is what I meant by my earlier remark: "If there a million cpu hungry tasks,
then the (real/wall-clock) time taken to switch between two tasks is more 
compared to the case where just two cpu hungry tasks are running".
