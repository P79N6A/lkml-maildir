You're wrong, nothing has to be commited ~52 MiB to the repository.
I'm not saying "commit", i'm saying
"Assume A & B binary git repos and delta_B-A another binary file, i
request built
B' = A + delta_B-A where is verified SHA1(B') = SHA1(B) for avoiding
corrupting".
Assume B is the higher repacked version of "A + minor commits of the day"
as if B was optimizing 24 hours more the minimum spanning tree. Wow!!!
