I don't consider the powerpc virtual IRQs a solution for the problem.
While I believe you did the right thing for powerpc with generalizing
this over all its platforms, it really isn't more than a workaround
for the problem that we can't deal well with the static irq_desc
array.
When that problem is now getting worse on other architectures, we
should try to get it right on all of them, rather than spreading
the workaround further.
