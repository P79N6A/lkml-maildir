and just to finish off this still-twitching horse, i'm not that
concerned if someone else gets the attribution.  that patch was so
trivial, it's not like i'm going to parade it around as my
contribution to the kernel.  (and, as i said, it's entirely possible
that this was just one of those wild coincidences.)
i'm far more interested in at least knowing what happens to patches
once they enter the system, so i can plan on what kind of cleanup i
can work on next.
