>tcpdump traces and possibly also strace data.
Tcpdumps for both the 2.2.2-ac3 and 2.0.36 kernels have been placed at:
	
ftp://www.livepage.com/pub/LinuxKernelBug/
The same material is being requested/transferred in both dumps. The server was
running on host-210 port 3000. Again the client was running on NT4.
I was unable to successfully get strace data for the server. Either strace
doesn't handle calls from threads properly, or I was using it incorrectly. All
of the TCP work is being done by threads, not by the main process of the server.
