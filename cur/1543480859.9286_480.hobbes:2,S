EXT2-fs error (device 08:01): ext2_find_entry: bad entry in directory
#284673: rec_len is too small for name_len - offset=1436, inode=284754,
rec_len=20, name_len=41
We have burned three machines now and all three are getting the same
error.  I need to have an idea what this is.  I find it hard to
believe that we happen to get three bad drives in a row.  All hardware
has been switched out at least three times.
I need an *answer* on this.
Please cc me if possible.
