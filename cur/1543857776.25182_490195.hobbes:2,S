Yeah, I've been told Windows has 4 kernels (SMP/UP x PAE/NonPAE).  In
the case of a microkernel it'd be trivial; in the case of a monolith,
you'd basically be shoehorning uK behavior in, probably by compiling
both sets of functions and linking the appropriate set just-in-time
(i.e. before entering protected mode).  This would be an ugly hack.

OpenSuSE and Fedora Core 6 both fail this; I checked the .config for the
default kernels (by proxy on OpenSuSE 10.2; I asked someone) and ran my
test case on FC6 (LiveCD from
http://www.fedoraunity.org/news-archives/fedora-core-6-zod-live-spins-released
).
