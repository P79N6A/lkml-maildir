I am looking for a possibility to read out the last timestamp when an 
interrupt has occured.
e.g.: the user presses a key on the keyboard. Where can I read out the 
timestamp of this event?
To be more precise, I 'm looking for
( )a function call
( ) a callback where I can register to be notified when an event occurs
( ) a global accessible variable
( ) a /proc entry
or something like that.
Any ideas ?
