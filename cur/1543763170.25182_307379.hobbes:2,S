Subject: Directory link count wrapping on Linux/XFS/i386?

I was looking around to see how Linux handles directories with a
high link count (ie. when they have many subdirectories) and I think
I have stumbled across a bug in the Linux xfs glue.
It seems that internally xfs uses a 32 bit field for the link count,
and the stat64 syscalls use a 32 bit field. These fields are copied
via the vattr structure in xfs_vnode.h, which uses a nlink_t for
the link count. However, in the kernel, I think this field is
actually of type __kernel_nlink_t which seems to be 16 bits on many
platforms.
I've tested this on an i386 2.6.11 kernel and it seems that the
link count presented to userland wraps after 65536 subdirectories.
This naturally doesn't let you screw up the filesystem or anything,
but it does let you can hide files from find/fts, as demonstrated
below.
I guess to fix it you'd change the type of nlink in struct vattr
so that it is the same type (unsigned int) as the type in struct
kstat. I've included the obvious patch, but I don't have a machine
that I can test it on right now.
