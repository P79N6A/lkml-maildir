I think this while idea is flawed.  Please separate out the ATA code
so it can be compiled out whelibata isn't built in, but it defintly
shouldn't be a separate module.  We're not doing any complexity like
that in any other subsystem (we used to do for AGP but got rid of it
again because it caused lots of problems).
