   wrong ;) stracing tar pointed out that is got something to do with sockets
   ;/ from some strange (to me) reason it opens a socket (sunrpc ? tar ??) on
   interface lo and repeats this for every +-5 files ;(
   and 2.0.36 didn't show this behaviour, in fact, it does everything exactly
   the same, but it delays less long. (in fact you don't notice it)
It's probably trying nis/nisplus lookups for usernames in the tarball
which don't exist in /etc/passwd on your local machine.
