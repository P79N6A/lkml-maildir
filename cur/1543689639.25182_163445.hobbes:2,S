Always be precise: there are six modes, namely
translated/untranslated Set 1/2/3.
By default every recent keyboard comes up in translated Set 2.
atkbd.c is broken, because it expects what the keyboard does not send,
namely untranslated Set 2.
{and here "send" is not defined as what bits are on some cable,
that is invisible for the programmer and varies between systems,
but as what bits get read by the kernel}

There are several misunderstandings in this paragraph.
No, the BIOS is not involved - Linux does not use the BIOS,
except possibly at boot time.
Both translated and untranslated Set 2 use E0 prefixes,
and E0 is translated to E0.
The translation is done by the keyboard controller.
On many laptops the strange construction of a keyboard that sends
the wrong codes, which then are translated by a separate microprocessor,
is thrown out, and the keyboard directly produces the desired codes,
namely translated Set 2, and no translation happens.
Also the compatibility mode of USB only knows about translated Set 2.

There is nothing normal about this untranslated Set 2.
It is a figment of the imagination.
Laptop hardware doesnt know anything about it.

Yes, indeed, so we introduce some small bugs by doing this silly
untranslation.

Yes, precisely.

Yes, precisely.
And indeed, no sanitization is needed at all.

But that is a bug in atkbd.
