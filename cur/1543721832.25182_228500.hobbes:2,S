Yes, that was my mistake. I looked at /proc/self/wchan, which is 
probably the only one who outputs a number ...
But anyways you can get the number from /proc/*/stat like in 2.4

Yes. Let them revert to the 2.4 code again, only change that they
should read /proc/kallsyms instead of /boot/System.map

I straced a fairly recent SUSE top and it didn't access wchan
in normal operation.

When it starts to get contended the read locks tend to be slower
because they have to bounce more cache lines around.
