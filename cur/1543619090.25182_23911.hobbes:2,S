I recently came into posession of an Adaptec 1480 cardbus SCSI
adaptor.  Using kernel 2.4.18-pre7 this adaptor does not work
properly with hotplug.  I find that the following change allows
the hotplug driver to properly load the aic7xxx driver when a
hotplug "add" event occurs.  Removing the card, and then
re-inserting it fails to properly reinitialize the device (unless
the aic7xxx module has been manually unloaded in between), but
this happens with or without this patch.  At least with this
patch, the device will load in the first place.  Does this look
agreeable?
