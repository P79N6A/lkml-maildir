hi,
I'd like to know of min/max will stay in kernel.h in their current (and
fucking ugly, IMO) form or if they eventually will be moved to something
like type_min() type_max().
I've read a lot of emails contra the 3-parm. min/max macros. Does our
supreme deity listen to HIS followers or is this more like a
"le etat est moi" --- "der kernel bin ich" question?
