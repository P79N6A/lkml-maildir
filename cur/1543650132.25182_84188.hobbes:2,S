Nasty, it's odd how noone else seems to have noticed this?

I can confirm that this fixes my 'loosing data under vm pressure' bug,
both for O_DIRECT case and sgio. It passed 1 iteration of both tests, it
would not even get past the 10% mark before. Thanks!
BTW, 2.5.44-mm6 showed some funnies and corrupted data in other
interesting ways. I'm hesitant to report this as a bug right now, as it
may just have been that the target fs had not been fsck'ed after being
run under one of the buggy kernels. But it did crash in the end, dumping
lots of hot/cold warnings. The above verification was run under 2.5.44 +
sgio patches + your standalone __set_page_dirty() fix.
