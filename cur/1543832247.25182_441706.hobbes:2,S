I don't really have access to the hardware, or know the x86-64 details perhaps Andi Kleen 
would be of more help. But my suspicion is that the remapping doesn't work for i/o devices
because of hardware or BIOS.  One simple workaround is to force use of the I/O mmu on
the amd64 processor. This has a small performance impact (requires more setup).
See Documentation/x86_64/boot-options.txt iommu=force
