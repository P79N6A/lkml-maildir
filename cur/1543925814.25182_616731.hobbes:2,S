The preemption issue is within following code which need to be done in a
short enough period.
+	kvm_get_msr(vcpu, MSR_IA32_TIME_STAMP_COUNTER,
+			  &vcpu->hv_clock.last_tsc);
+
+	ktime_get_ts(&ts);
+	vcpu->hv_clock.now_ns = ts.tv_nsec + (NSEC_PER_SEC *
(u64)ts.tv_sec);
+	vcpu->hv_clock.wc_sec = get_seconds();
I am even thinking we have to disable interrupt between these lines,
otherwise
guest wall clock may see backward time source when calculating the
delta TSC since last vcpu->hv_clock.now_ns update.
Also why we use both ktime_get_ts(&ts) & get_seconds() together? they
are not atomic
and may cause issues?
thx,eddie
