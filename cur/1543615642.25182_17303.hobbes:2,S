Subject: kernel log messages using wrong timezone

How does the kernel figure out how to timestamp the log output?  The reason I'm
asking is that we have a system that has /etc/localtime pointing to the
Americas/Montreal timezone, but the log output from the kernel appears to be
UTC.
Can anyone point me to the right place to deal with this?
Thanks,
Chris
