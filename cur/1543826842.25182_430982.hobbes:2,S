parallely with TETware distributed test harness (that can schedule processes
parallely and using its synchronisizing mechanism) but after running for
some time some processes get stuck at futex system call and waiting
infinetly that i found with strace utility.Can you please tell me whether
its bug of kernel or it has something to do with my program and setup.
