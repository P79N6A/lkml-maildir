Yes, late night typing (my brain went to sleep before my fingers).

The system I dumped the info from only has 256MB. SCSI calls
blk_queue_bounce_limit with the return value of
scsi_calculate_bounce_limit which takes the dma_mask set by the adapter.
Some adapters set this value based the adapters capabilities and
CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G, but the aic7xxx also checks the memsize.
My config on this system also has (CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G, CONFIG_HIGHMEM,
and CONFIG_X86_PAE) set.
