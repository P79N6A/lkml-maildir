Lot's of very cool ideas for IB ...not knowing much about IB, but
being curious and interested, I have a question which may be stupid
so I apoligize in advance if it is...
Can we really have these sort of low level IB interactions and have :
    - security issues addressed, mostly an issue if the devices are over 
a network w/other devices
       doing other things for other processes/people...
       (I get the a bit scared when someone suggests that a remote 
device can write directly to my frame
         buffer or disk, I hope there are security controls in place!)
    - congestion control (already mentioned)
    - qos control
OR is it saner to layer TCP/IP etc. over IB... it seems to me the point
others were making was that  there is more to "network"  style services
than just passing bits from here to there...will IB have low level
support many of the features people have come to expect?
Thanks!
