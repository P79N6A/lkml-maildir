Dear Alan,
Thank you very much for your help.
I'm going to have a look at the table you mentioned. Yes, I know that
usually one should make the selection from application, in my case I'm
trying to uniform two different hardware maintaining  the
configuration for applications (running on both).
The hws have a different combination of kind serials and I would like
to present the same ttyS* to applications. I need to have different
kernel configuration so I thought I could uniform things there....I'm
going to evaluate the hardness
