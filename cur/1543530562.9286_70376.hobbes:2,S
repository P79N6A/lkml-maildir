As long as you remain within your resource quota limits...
Using resource accounting and quota controls will prevent the SYSTEM
from OOM conditions. Users (and processes) will get an Out-Of-Resource
errors which the users can deal with. The system administrators and
managemnt can analyze the resource accounting and determin where to
assign/reassign allocations of a finite resource. In all cases, the
system should not crash. System processes should not abort unless they
are exceeding the resources allocated to them. User processes should
not be able to cause random process aborts.
This also allows self recovery from some forms of DoS attacks. If
telnetd recieves 1000 connections then it could exceed resource
limits. inetd may die (or sendmail or...). With resource limits
in place, at least inetd would be able to handle that - if say
no more than 50 concurrent interactive logins were allowed, the
other connections would be denied. The same goes for Apache which
DOES do this. If the proper resource allocation were given then
usrs running wild memory allocators would not be able to crash
the system by causing init to die.
All else is a matter of implementation.
