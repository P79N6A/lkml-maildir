There are many submenus in the config system where the fist option 
controls the availability of the remaining options. This is very 
inconvenient in menuconfig, since you'll have to enter each menu
to see whether or not the corresponding subsystem is enabled.
I suggest moving the first option out of the subsystem by changing
'menu' to 'menuconfig', as demonstrated by the patch below.
