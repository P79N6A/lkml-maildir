Yes.  Yes.  And even worse: SILENTLY drop it.  The reason was:
     global taboo header: m!OJFS!
I don't recall why that was declared taboo, but it apparently bites

We (the postmasters) can approve your messages for posting, but it
will take a few hours that I get off work, and have time to do it.
(I need to do some additional setups, all those lists are not
in my existing majordomo password database..)
