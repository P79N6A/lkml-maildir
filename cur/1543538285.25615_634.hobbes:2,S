I had to bump the limit on a machine here to 64k inodes, because
someone was generating large numbers of small files. So I'd prefer
a higher limit as well. Unfortunately, inodes are hugely bloated
(taking at least 396 bytes), so 64k inodes would take up nearly 25 MiB
of RAM! We probably shouldn't do that by default.
However, I note that 2.3.99 and later don't have this control file
anyway. Perhaps it's dynamic now?
Hopefully one day someone will reduce the inode bloat.
