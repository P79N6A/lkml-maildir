HP did two completely different PCI-Express Low-Profile SCSI HBAs:
The single-channel (HP SC11 Xe) one looks very similiar to the
LSI20320IE, but the HP version appeared months before the LSI version.
The dual-channel version (AH627A; see
<
http://www.hardware.com/product.asp?id=AH627A>,
 other Web sites show
a wrong photo with a PCI-X connector) seems to be an Atto UL5D
Low-profile.
Ralf's card looks a lot like my Atto UL5D Lowprofile. For the first
SCSI channel:
  # lspci -v -s 0d:04.0
0d:04.0 SCSI storage controller: Atto Technology Ultra320 SCSI Host Adapter (rev 08)
        Subsystem: Atto Technology Unknown device 802f
        Flags: bus master, 66MHz, medium devsel, latency 128, IRQ 17
        I/O ports at 6000 [size=256]
        Memory at fbc40000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=256K]
        Memory at fbc00000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=256K]
        [virtual] Expansion ROM at c2800000 [disabled] [size=1M]
        Capabilities: [50] Power Management version 2
        Capabilities: [58] Message Signalled Interrupts: Mask- 64bit+ Queue=0/0 Enable-
        Capabilities: [68] PCI-X non-bridge device
I just tested mine with Linux 2.6.24.4, and it finds the attached DLT
drives and they work. I missed Ralf's original problem but the output
above suggests that it didn't find any devices?
