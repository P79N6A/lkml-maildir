There is assembler code to write, which as I stated several
times nobody is going to work on or test.
It is unreasonable to add this new VMEMMAP requirement in order for
your patches to work properly.

Someone has to implement and test VMEMMAP now on all of these
architectures, it is becomming a requirement unlike in the sparsemem
patches case where it was optional.
That's unreasonable.
