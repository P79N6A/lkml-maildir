I have already answered to Ulrich about this. Just to
make this sub-thread consistent:
The "fix" I mention is just returning -EINVAL in case user orders 
CLONE_NEWPIDS and compiling out all the namespace cloning code. This 
is just a more elegant way to get rid of pid namespaces rather than 
Ingo proposed.
