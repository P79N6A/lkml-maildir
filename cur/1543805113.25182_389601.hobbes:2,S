It depends which clock you are referring to. Sound cards can set the 
sample rate. Sound cards also set "period" sizes, so that once enough 
samples have been captured by the sound card hardware, the hardware 
initiates a DMA transfer. Could this "period" be the "clock speed" 
setting you are talking about?

So, the "DMA_COUNT" sounds like what ALSA refers to as the period.
All the rest, IRQ, start/stop are handled but the current ALSA sound 
card drivers. The DMA channel to use would have to be a kernel module 
option if they use jumpers.
