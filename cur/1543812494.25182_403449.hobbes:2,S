Preliminary patches allowing gcc-4.1 to compile the 2.4 kernel
are now available:
<
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/patches/2.4/patch-gcc4-fixes-v14-2.4.33-pre2>
Baseline patches for gcc-4.0.2, known to work on i386, x86_64, and ppc32.

Add-on patches (on top of the gcc-4.0.2 patches) for gcc-4.1.0.
The status of the gcc-4.1.0 patches right now is that:
- gcc-4.1.0 is known to work on i386 and x86_64. i386 worked as-is,
  but x86_64 needed -fno-strict-aliasing while compiling
  arch/x86_64/boot/compressed/misc.c in order to avoid massive
  memory corruption at boot. The bulk of the patches just silence
  tons of warnings.
- gcc-4.1.0 is known to NOT work on ppc32. The kernel compiles
  cleanly and boots OK, but running a big 'patch' job (e.g. to
  prepare a 2.6.16-rc5 source tree) causes a repeatable oops in
  shrink_dcache_parent().
gcc-4.1.0 does generate noticeably smaller kernels than gcc-4.0.2.
