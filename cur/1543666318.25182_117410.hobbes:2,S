SDET on my machine (16x NUMA-Q) has fallen in love with your patch, 
and has decided to elope with it to a small desert island. This is 
despite it's one disk hung off node 0, and the IO througput of a 
slightly damp piece of cotton thread. Apologies for the loss of your 
patch as it gets whisked away ;-)

PS. Oh, I had this bit, per akpm-instructions: For best results, add ____cacheline_aligned_in_smp to struct ext2_bg_info
PPS. I'll try to run some more focused tests with aim7 over the weekend.
As if we needed it ...
