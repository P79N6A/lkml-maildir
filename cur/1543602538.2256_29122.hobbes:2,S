it was SPECweb99 tests done in 32 GB RAM, 8 CPUs, where the pagecache was
nearly 30 GB big. We saw visible pagecache_lock contention on such
systems. Due to TUX's use of zerocopy, page lookups happen at a much
larger frequency and they are not intermixed with memory copies - in
contrast with workloads like dbench.
