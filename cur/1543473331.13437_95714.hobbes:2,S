This was put in by someone to fix some code before 2.2.0 final was
released. My guess is that Donald Becker did it himself. No matter. To
finish your compile just edit drivers/net/tulip.c and comment out that
line. If tulip.c worked for you before, it should work for you now. Just
comment out that line, it wont hurt ;)
