The way the backwards-compatibility is _meant_ to work is that a driver 
can just do this:
	#ifndef IRQ_RETVAL
	  typedef void irqreturn_t;
	  #define IRQ_NONE
	  #define IRQ_HANDLED
	  #define IRQ_RETVAL(x)
	#endif
and after that you can just use the 2.5.x semantics even with a 2.4.x 
kernel.
Which is nice and clean, and allows you to support old kernels _without_ 
having any translation layer.
