I can second this somehow. I was testing 2.4.2 on SX164 alpha, same
AHA-2940UW controller. In my case, system freezes solid if I do extensive
reading from CD-ROM (NEC CD-ROM DRIVE:465). It happens using stock AIC7xxx
driver (5.3.something) as well as the new (6.1.2 or something).
I'm back to 2.2.18 using AIC7xxx v5.1.31 and everything is happy.
This makes me believe that it must be mid-layer SCSI drivers causing
problems.
Peace!
