So, to summarise (for 32-bit CPUs):
o  Alan Cox & Manfred Spraul say 4-byte alignment is guaranteed.
o  If you need larger alignment, you need to alloc a larger space,
   round as necessary, and keep the original pointer for kfree()
Maybe I'll just use get_free_pages, since it's a 64KB chunk that
I need (and it's only a once-off).
Thanks for your advice.
Later,
Kenn
