Ahh, thanks for that, it did the trick.
I also needed to add this to include/asm-um/pgtable.h:
#define io_remap_pfn_range(vma, vaddr, pfn, size, prot)         \
                 remap_pfn_range(vma, vaddr, pfn, size, prot)
And replace config.h with autoconf.h in arch/um/drivers/x11_kern.c
Then I hit:
arch/um/drivers/built-in.o:include/linux/input.h:1168: more undefined 
references to `input_event' follow
So I added: "select INPUT" to Kconfig
(starting with a defconfig might have done the trick too)
Then I hit:
arch/um/drivers/built-in.o: In function `x11_probe':
arch/um/drivers/x11_kern.c:442: undefined reference to `init_input_dev'
So I replaced:
         init_input_dev(kd->mouse);
with:
	kd->mouse = input_allocate_device();
That gave me a working kernel, but no x11 window appeared....
(I tried adding x11=640x480 to the command line too - no effect)
I then tried this patch:
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/work/current/2.6/2.6.21-rc1/patches/x11-fb
(fixing similar issues)
I had to comment out the line containing "soft_cursor" (couldn't figure 
out where to get it from)
It also required a lot of search and replace to change all instances of:
	kd->mouse.XXX
to
	kd->mouse->XXX
(same for kbd and changes to the initialization code)
Looks like the CONFIG_FB_CFB_FILLRECT and friends should not be set:
   LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
drivers/built-in.o: In function `cfb_copyarea':
drivers/video/cfbcopyarea.c:344: multiple definition of `cfb_copyarea'
arch/um/drivers/built-in.o:arch/um/drivers/../../../drivers/video/cfbcopyarea.c:344: 
first defined here
drivers/built-in.o: In function `cfb_imageblit':
drivers/video/cfbimgblt.c:263: multiple definition of `cfb_imageblit'
arch/um/drivers/built-in.o:arch/um/drivers/../../../drivers/video/cfbimgblt.c:263:

drivers/built-in.o: In function `cfb_fillrect':
drivers/video/cfbfillrect.c:345: multiple definition of `cfb_fillrect'
arch/um/drivers/built-in.o:arch/um/drivers/../../../drivers/video/cfbfillrect.c:345: 
Finally, this one pops up an X11 window, but it dies instantly:
[...]
