   the server just freezes. nothing on the screan. trying to ping the server
   I realized the server is "crashed".
You'll have to give me very detailed description of what sort of
hardware you have, etc.  I can't duplicate this on any of my
systems.....
   I posted this "problem" a while ago, and someone told me it is a 
   known bug !? it crashs when you want to start the serial connection
   (on redhat /etc/rc.d/init.d/serial). it arrived only when you put
   a cable on a serial port and you do not connect it anywhere. it is
   beacase "the serial connection is opened" someone told me.
First of all, Red Hat doesn't install /etc/rc.d/init.d/serial.  (Checked
under both Red Hat 7.0 and Red Hat 6.2).  That script comes with some
version of setserial that I ship, but in its default configuration it
certainly won't crash machines.  You'll have to send me a copy of your
rc.d/init.d/serial script, plus my /etc/serial.conf for me to debug it.
Please also send me a detailed listing of what sort of hardware devices
you have, lspci -vv, etc.  I can assure you that most folks haven't been
having this problem, so something on your system must be seriously
screwed up.
