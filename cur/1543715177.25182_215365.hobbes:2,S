You right, sorry... I just glanced over it in the morning, saw Kconfig being
changed and jumped to a conclusion. The only excuse: -ENOCOFFEE :)
I would recommend splitting your patch in 3 pieces - one for reset, one for
targus and one for protocol selection. This way its easuier for Vojtech to
apply them.
Question - why did you kill the protocol names array?
Btw, I am also trying to work in that area, might be beneficial if we combine
our efforts. I just posted bunch of changes on the list, you may also grab
them with
