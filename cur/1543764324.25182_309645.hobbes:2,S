Does the FC-4 test kernel work? There was a bug in X6.8.2 but I think it
would be fixed in FC-4 test.. I run Xorg CVS on a 9200 with the latest
kernel and it seems fine... granted I've been able to crash it with
running a few wierd apps.. I've just had no chance to debug it yet but it
isn't the common case... maybe I should play tuxracer for a while..
the symptoms are typical of a card lockup, spinning in ioctl forever...
Dave.
