  A tcpdump at the remote end shows the packet leaving, but a tcpdump at
the local side doesn't show it until the next packet arrives. I tried
this on a system running nothing but tcpdump, but the network load is
high (ping sends packets as soon as the previous reply comes back).

  Another note: I run my 2.6.7 with Local APIC and IO-APIC. Maybe that
has to do with interrupt problems. I will try reverting to the older PIC
during further testing to see if that has an effect on things.
