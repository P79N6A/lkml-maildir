Heh, but we need to find a way to do it without config options...
#ifdef CONFIG_APM_RTC_IS_GMT
#       define  clock_cmos_diff 0
#       define  got_clock_diff  1
#else
...no, it is actually okay, CONFIG_APM_RTC_IS_GMT is only
optimalization.
Hmm...
...and arch/i386/kernel/time.c contains copy of that code. That means
that we should kill apm.c copy and see why time.c copy sometimes does
the wrong thing.
