Subject: system freeze with 2.4.8.

I'm running 2.4.8 with the ext3 0.9.6 patch.
I was running make dep, and suddenly it the disk stopped doing
anything.  All I could do with the keyboard was switch consoles.
I pressed alt+scroll lock a few times, and the EIP was about the
same each time, so I assume it's looping somewhere.
I wrote the EIP and Call trace down, and ran that thru ksymoops,
and got this:
>>EIP; c013d830 <prune_icache+28/114>   <=====
Trace; c013d934 <shrink_icache_memory+18/2c>
Trace; c0125410 <do_try_to_free_pages+1c/44>
Trace; c012548e <kswapd+56/e4>
Trace; c0105448 <kernel_thread+28/38>
