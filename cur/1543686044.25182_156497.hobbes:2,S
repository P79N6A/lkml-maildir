Would be nice, but almost impossible.
The problem you see are in device drivers, and device drivers
does not get fixed unless someone actually cares and fix the driver in
question.
During the 2.5 cycle several internal interfaces were changed
resulting in a wast amount of drivers that no longer compile.
The usual reply to postings like yours is "Patches welcome" ;-)
