If -funit-at-a-time really increases stack size too much on some compiler
version the right fix would be to check where it does that using make checkstack
and then add "noinline" attributes there to prevent the compiler from inlining.
That would prevent them.
Globally disabling it is too big a hammer.
e.g. I know XFS did it in a similar way to prevent this problem.
So I would reenable it for now and if you know it causes problems on specific
compiler versions, Adrian, you could watch make checkstack there and submit
noinline patches as needed.
