None of which contradicts "exchange of rights for a licsense" at all. The
agreement is not one sided - if you don't agree to the restrictions, you
have no liscense to use the software, period. Imposition of new terms that
one party did not agree to AFTER a contract was executed is what that law
is likely directed at - and that's the same just about anywhere in the
world.
