There have been some discussions on this, it seems possible to make the
information available, to {kernel,lockmanager,other}.

But that's true for other things as well, like locks on regions of files.
That hasn't prevented locking from working and being useful.
What I don't like is the idea of processes sitting forever with their
thumb up their ass waiting for an unlock which isn't going to come. I have
an application like that, starts a few thousand threads and spins at
10-70k ctx/sec forever. It's (a) commercial binary-only, and (b) selected
by management against my recommendations. The vendor blames Linux, of
course, "threads don't work right," meaning "like Solaris" rather than
"like POSIX."
I would LOVE to see Andrea's "Child Run First" and optional part of the
mainline kernel, the patch seems to solve the hang, but doesn't play well
with other patches.
I don't see either of the above as show stoppers, although I agree they
are implementation issues.
