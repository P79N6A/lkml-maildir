Hi,
 the nvidia modul is not loaded or enabled but X is running sometimes.
Anyways, it seems to happen if X is not running too.
Luckily I got a very helpfull hint from Hans-Christian Armingeon in
reply to my questions here on the list. The epic100.c from
http://lrcwww.epfl.ch/~boch/sw/epic100.c.txt
 fixes the problem in all
the affected kernel versions. 
Thanx for your help guys
