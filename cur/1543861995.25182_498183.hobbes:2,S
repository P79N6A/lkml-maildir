But why do you need "struct task_struct" at all?
The reason this doesn't happen on other platforms is that they don't use 
"struct task_struct". They use "struct thread_info", which is where the 
preemption counter is.
The problem on m68k i sthat broken indirection through "current", which is 
unnecessary. Isn't the thread structure on the stack on m68k too? So you 
could do what x86 does, and just do
	movel %a7,%d0
	andl $STACK_MASK,%d0
or something, and thus go directly to the thread-info rather than load it 
off the task pointer.
Or, if worst comes to worst, you can just hardcode the offset of the 
thread-info pointer in the "struct task_struct". It's the second word 
after "state". Ugly, but less so than forcing everybody who does NOT want 
to have that big <linux/sched.h> dependency to get it.
