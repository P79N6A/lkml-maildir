This reminds me, PCI Express makes the PCI config area larger, going
from 256 bytes to either 4K or 64K IIRC.
I wonder if we want new pci_{save,restore}_xstate functions?
Or change the pci_{save,restore}_state API now to work with larger
config areas?
Intel probably has some patches internally for this, I bet.
