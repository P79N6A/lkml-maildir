handle_fasteoi_irq is special. It is used by ioapic and weird Powerpc
hardware. We marked the ioapic level interrupts IRQ_LEVEL, so we wont
get a resend on them (see kernel/irq/resend.c)

Oops. I missed that one. I'll have a look at that as well.

AFAICT, there is no danger.

It is quite clear what happened:
1. The retrigger/resend mechanism was never meant to be used for level
type interrupts and it makes absolutely no sense. When a level type
interrupt is masked while active it is resent by hardware on unmask when
it is still active. The resend / retrigger mechanism is only useful for
edge type interrupts, because we would lose an interrupt when we mask it
delayed without triggering a resend on unmask.
2. I found a box similar to Marcins which gets confused when level type
interrupts are resent.

There is nothing to confuse anymore. The resend for level type
interrupts is not happening, which is the same behavior as we had before
the delayed disable. The edge type interrupts resend is there since we
did the big genirq changes (2.6.18) and it was tested on various boxen
(including the above one) quite extensive.
The delayed disable was added later and unfortunately introduced the
problems we've seen.
