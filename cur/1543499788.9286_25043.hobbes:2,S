Hello,
I have seen some posts in the local newsgroup regarding
problems with static data and I started to experiment
a bit. My setup is PPro, 96 MB RAM, 135 MB of swap
in one 65 MB and one 70 MB partition (total 231 MB
of vm), stock 2.2.10 kernel, egcs 1.1.2, glibc 2.1.1.
The limit setting is 
cputime         unlimited
filesize        unlimited
datasize        unlimited
stacksize       8192 kbytes
coredumpsize    0 kbytes
memoryuse       unlimited
descriptors     1024 
memorylocked    unlimited
maxproc         256 
openfiles       1024
Program #1:
=== snip ===
#include <stdio.h>
#include <malloc.h>
/* define to represent appr. half of your mem+swap */
#define N1 128
static int x[N1*1024*1024/sizeof(int)];
main()
{
  int i;
  char *p;
  if (! (p=(char *)malloc(N1*1024*1024)))
    fprintf(stderr, "process %d: Not enough memory for malloc\n", getpid());
  fprintf(stderr, "process %d setting dynamic area\n", getpid());
  for (i=0; i < N1*1024*1024; i+=4096)
    p[i] = 1;
  fprintf(stderr, "process %d set dynamic area\n", getpid());
  fprintf(stderr, "process %d setting static area\n", getpid());
  for (i=0; i < sizeof(x)/sizeof(int); i+=4096/sizeof(int))
    x[i] = 1;
  fprintf(stderr, "process %d set static area\n", getpid());
  sleep(10);
  fprintf(stderr, "process %d ending\n", getpid());
  exit(0);
}
=== snip ==
The program defines a static area of 128 MB, then allocates
128 MB dynamically, writes something there and proceeds
to write to the static area.
The surprise #1 is that the dynamic alloc succeeded,
even if the memory requested by the process was
more than total amount of vm in the machine. I find
the assumption that the process won't be using all
of the requested memory a bit too optimistic.
Is there a possibility to change this behaviour?
The process then proceeded to set the static area.
When it consumed all of the available vm,
it crashed with a bus error. This is _bad_ -
a well written program checks for the mallocs() and
such returning zero, but there is no easy way
(if any) of detecting that the system cannot make
a copy-on-write for a page in a static buffer.
This can happen just anytime (the huge area
makes it more probable) and the problem is
that if I want to make a robust application,
I cannot. Not good for critical applications.
Of course, there were more applications that crashed
because of memory shortage - X server being one of them
(so I cannot copy&paste the result of the program :-))
and IDE subsystem was having problems too:
% dmesg
hdc: timeout waiting for DMA
hdc: irq timeout: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hdc: DMA disabled
ide1: reset: success
Out of memory for httpd.
Out of memory for klogd.
Out of memory for update.
Out of memory for actived.
Out of memory for rclock.
Out of memory for syslogd.
Out of memory for gpm.
Out of memory for init.
Well, let's check whether we can guard against
such code deployed as DoS:
=== snip ===
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <sys/resource.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
static char x[128*1024*1024];
main()
{
  int i;
  struct rlimit limit;
  getrlimit(RLIMIT_RSS, &limit);
  printf("RSS limit curr, max: %d, %d\n", limit.rlim_cur, limit.rlim_max);
  if (! malloc(20000000))
    printf("malloc not successfull - good\n");
  for (i=0; i < sizeof(x); i+=4096)
    x[i] = 1;
  system("ps gauxww | grep a.out | grep -v grep");
  exit(0);
}
=== snip ===
% limit  memoryuse 10000
% limit  datasize 10000
% ./a.out
RSS limit curr, max: 10240512, 2147483647
stano     1929 27.4 81.9 151660 78760 pts/3  S    16:47   0:03 ./a.out
so the process happily consumed 77 MB of real memory
and allowed to allocate 20 MB dynamically instead
of failing because of the limit.
Now my question is: is there any way to guard
against this?
I don't know the vm subsystem and the interactions
with glibc - the dynamic allocation obviously
goes through mmap and is not checked against
the limits. The static area is in the object
header and probably gets around the check too ...
Perhaps someone clarifies these issues.
