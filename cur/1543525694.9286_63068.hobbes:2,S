I wasn't so much interested in that level as the one where SCSI is itself a 
networking protocol.  Current SCSI drives are effectively IDE drives with 
on-board computers that do SCSI "networking"; at this level, smart drives 
with STP networking differ only in that they're potentially a little more 
general, and that you need to use slightly newer (but common) hardware and 
code to implement it.

    We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
