Very easy.  Allocations are variable sized.  Without the wrapper I would
have to copy and paste the wrapped code all over the ntfs driver as
there is no way to tell which one I would need in advance.
I used to simply use vmalloc() but that caused loads of people's
machines to run out of vmalloc space in a matter of hours and also
vmalloc is much slower so I added the kmalloc if a page and vmalloc
otherwise.
Note just using kmalloc is no good as it doesn't go high enough in size
(again this problem was being hit by people which is why I had switched
to vmalloc in the first place).
Also kmalloc with size > PAGE_SIZE used to cause machines to run OOM and
give page order > 1 allocation failures, hence why I never use kmalloc
for more than one page any more.
Also note I only use the ntfs_malloc_nofs() wrapper if I have to.  If I
know how much I am allocating or at least know that the maximum is quite
small, I use kmalloc() directly.  It is pretty much only for the runlist
allocations that I use the wrapper as the runlist is typically small but
for fragmented files it can grow huge.  I have seen runlists consuming
over 256kiB of ram, without vmalloc that would be a real problem...
Best regards,
        Anton
