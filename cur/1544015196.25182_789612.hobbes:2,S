Hi everyone,
I just ported LTTng to 2.6.28. Enjoy !
You may also want to upgrade to lttv 0.12.5 which puts back the syscall
and softirq names in the event list.
For newcomers, instructions to install LTTng can be found at :

(I just updated the QUICKSTART guide. Please feel free to try it and
report inconsistencies.)
Mathieu
