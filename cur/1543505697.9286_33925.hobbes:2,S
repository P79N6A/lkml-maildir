Yes.
if(link(oldfile, newfile) >= 0) unlink(oldfile); else perror("Rename failed");

News demons use hard links.
Well really, you can do it but...
The only way to make symlinks reliably emulate hard links is to make it 
something like this:
link()
{
   if [ -f $1 ]
   then
      NEXTNAME= ...
      mv $1 /linkdir/$NEXTNAME
      ln -s /linkdir/$NEXTNAME $1
   fi
   LINKNAME=`readlink $1`
   ln -s $LINKNAME $2
}
You'll also need to do something about keeping link counts so can move the
file out of the links directory when there's only one pointer at it.
UMSDOS doesn't do this so there are problems with empty directories that 
aren't really ...
Of course this all defeats your purpose slightly :-)
Or perhaps not, they could have a quota on the links directory too.
