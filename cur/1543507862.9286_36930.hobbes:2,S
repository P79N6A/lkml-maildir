I have an early VAIO laptop (PCG-707C) that has USB ports, but nothing 
in the BIOS setup screens to configure/enable them.  The laptop came
with Win95 OSR2 preinstalled, and I can use the USB devices with my
Logitech scanner in Windows.
I built the USB drivers in Linux 2.2.10, but when I tried to loaded
the usb-uhci module, I got EBUSY, because the IRQ registered was 0.
Apperently, the BIOS initializes the PCI INTERRUPT_LINE register to
0xff for this device.  I can change this value with setpci, but it
doesn't change the value already stored in the PCI structures in the
kernel.
I don't think it's reasonable to expect Sony to update their BIOS on
this old machine to allow me to program the IRQ.  I need a way to tell 
the Linux kernel what IRQ it can use for the USB device.
cheers,
Drago
