Hello,
i tried to use kgdb over ethernet, but when using the tool ifconfig, or 
dhcpcd all i get back is:
  -> "SIOCSIFFLAGS: Device or resource busy"
Two things i notived:
KGDB_stub holds interrupt 4,
the via-rhine driver holds no interrupt!
2.6.0-mm2 also fails, 2.6.0-mm1 worked (with net_poll patch in via_rhine.c)
with kind regards
thomas meyer
