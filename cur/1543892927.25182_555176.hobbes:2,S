Oh, yes! Thank you. The one thing I didn't check - since dummy had no 
parameters in 2.4 kernels, it didn't occur to me to do a modinfo. I just 
did a modprobe dummy0 numdummies=99 and there we are - 99 devices. Thank 
you. I will pass this info on. I searched high and lo through user 
groups and mailing lists, but dummy is such a common word that it is 
difficult to narrow down the search.
Thank you again.
