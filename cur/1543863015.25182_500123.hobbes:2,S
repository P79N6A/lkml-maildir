I've been confused by 'vma->vm_pgoff' meaning. I assumed that it was
an offset relatif to the start of the kernel address space
(PAGE_OFFSET) as the commit message I submitted explains. So doing:
	fd = open("/dev/kmem", O_RDONLY);
	kmem = mmap(NULL, size, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 4 * 4096);
actually asks for a kernel space mapping which start 4 pages after the
begining of the kernel memory space.
So yes, if the 'offset' expected by 'mmap(/dev/kmem, ..., offset)'
usage is actually a kernel virtual address the patch I submitted is
wrong. The offending line should have been something like:
	pfn = PFN_DOWN(virt_to_phys((void *)(vma->vm_pgoff << PAGE_SHIFT)));
and in this case 'vma->vm_pgoff' has no sense to me. My apologizes for
this mess.

yes it doesn't seems to be used. In my case, I was just playing with
it when I submitted the patch but have no real usages.
