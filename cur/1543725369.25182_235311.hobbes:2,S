I am having trouble with O_DIRECT. Trying to read or write from a block 
device partition.
1. Can O_DIRECT be used on a plain block device partition say 
"/dev/sda11" without having a filesystem on it.
2. If no file system is created then what should be the softblock size. 
I am using the IOCTL "BLKBSZGET". Is this correct?
3. Can we use SEEK_END with O_DIRECT on a partition without filesystem.
Any help will be highly regarded.
