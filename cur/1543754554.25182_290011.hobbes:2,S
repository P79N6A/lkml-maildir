Hmm not really, I just seem to have a very large piece of
non-cache/buffer memory that seems reluctant to shrink on light memory
pressure. This makes the box feel sluggish, if I force reclaim by
running fillmem and swapping on/off again, it feels much better.
I should mention that this is with 2.6.bk + andreas oom patches that he
asked me to test. I can try 2.6.11-rc2-bkX if you think I should.
