I'm not subscribed to the linux-kernel list, I would appreciate a CC on
any replies, but I will be watching the list as well.
I am using kernel 2.4.24 on a heavily-used NFS server.  I am receiving
hundreds of messages like:
"kernel: fh_verify: no root_squashed access at sessions/lastsession."
in my messages log, usually accompanied by a "last message repeated 6497
times" a minute or so later.  I'm gathering it is just reporting it is
denying root access to a share, which is fine and exactly what I asked
for.  Is there anyway to shut this logging off without just wiping the
line from fs/nfsd/nfsfh.c?  I really can't afford to be rebooting the
box to install a new kernel right now.  I've searched google,
linux-kernel, and other resources, and while I've found others with the
same problem, no solutions have been posted.
