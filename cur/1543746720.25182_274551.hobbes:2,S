I'm thinking I should actually be removing the comment. The C is simple,
clear, fast and easy to maintain and we haven't actually had any
problems at all with compilers. All my tweaking in here has turned out
to be irrelevant to the real cause of problems (I recently found a bug
where work queues were wrongly inheriting freezer flags; since fixing
that, all the symptoms in this area have gone away).

Nigel
