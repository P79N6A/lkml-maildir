ah, i thought core kernel. I took a look, and i doubt that doing the 
megaraid SAS thing over a kernel thread would show up on the radar. If 
it does then it should probably be done in its separate per-CPU 
workqueue anyway, not in a globally scheduled thing like a tasklet. 
Tasklets just dont scale.
