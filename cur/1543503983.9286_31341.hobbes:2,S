Hello all,
I may have been unclear in my postings about PCI bridges that donnot 
flush posted transactions as PCI specifications required them to do.
The sym and ncr drivers perform a single read (from SCRIPTS for the sym
and (from the CPU for the ncr) in order to synchronize correctly when  
compliant bridges are used.
When flushing of posted writes by the bridge do not happen as expected due
to some bridge quirk, it may exist a small window where a completion may
be lost (I can describe the scenario if needed).
Compared to other PCI device drivers I am able to understand the code,
most of them may lose a completion even when conformant bridges are used.
But the ncr and sym drivers require a non conformant bridge to run the
same risk and are quite safe when the bridge is correct.
The reasons we donnot experience problems are the following:
1. There is a small window, basically the PCI device completing an IO 
   at the moment the C code deals with corresponding flags in IO
   registers, where the problem may occur.
2. Bridges are generally fast to flush buffers and the interrupt latency 
   is generally very short. So sitution (1) above is very unlikely
   to happen.
3. If situation (1) occurs and the PCI device is able to accept several
   concurrent IOs, a subsequent completion will wake up the IRQ handler 
   and the CPU will reap the lost completion. So, the problem will not 
   be visible.
Even, if completion/interrupt lossage is very unlikely to happen here, 
since Murphy's law is defeated due to 1+2+3, I did want the ncr/sym
drivers not to be confused by non PCI conformant bridges when it is 
possible.
There are some other broken bridge implementations for which the ncr/sym
driver and very probably most of other PCI device drivers may experience
consistency problems. Just think to the following:
A) Bridges that reorder (DMA) writes to memory.
B) Systems bridges that donnot ensure cache coherency.
For these ones, drivers must probably limit themselves to the following:
1. Perform one IO at a time. I mean only queue 1 IO at a time to the 
   controller and let the controller wait for the CPU to restart 
   operation from the interrupt handler.
2. Ensure from the CPU by some hardware mechanism that _all_ writes are
   flushed prior to signal completion to user.
I also intend to provide changes that will allow some support for so
broken bridges if I discover some existing ones. 
All the coherency problems that may occur due to non compliant bridges are
not fixable generically for all PCI device drivers at the same time. The
work-arounds, when possible, are to be implemented in each driver and may
differs due to hardware or driver differences.
Have I been clear this time ?
Regards,
   Gérard.
