I didn't say such things don't exist: I'm well aware of them.  It is
not the norm, and such things are not foolproof.  That's all I said.

These generally require that you use the floppy or CD interface card
provided by your laptop vendor, not an arbitrary off-the-shelf PCMCIA
IDE card.  The 'smart' BIOSes are not so smart as to be able to
configure arbitrary removable media devices.  They may work with other
cards, and they may not.
