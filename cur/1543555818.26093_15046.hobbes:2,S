I hate to jump in here in the middle of a perfectly good argument but I'd like
to point out a few things:
a) If RedHat/RedHat-like distros needs these changes they can include this
patch.  The plus side is it won't piss off the people that seem to care and
don't use said distros the down side is that if/when another security update
comes out people will have to hope this patch applies easily still, if they
update themselves.
b) Are these switches which used to be valid in modutils 2.3.x?  If so, why?
It makes perfect sense to keep this patch around until modutils 2.4 (or 2.5
if modutils version is still supposed to match kernel version).  If these
are old modutils 2.2.x switches, see part a).
And c) Why does it matter if RedHat/etc would have to adapt their scripts.
There's always part a, or what debian does for stable sometimes, backporting
fixes.  Or even lots of sed & awk magic.
