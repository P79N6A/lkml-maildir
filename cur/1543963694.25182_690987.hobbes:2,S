No you need 8x for 10-GigE.  The 250 MB/sec per lane is 2 Gbps per lane
so 4x is only 8 Gbps.  For a typical PCI-E transaction size of 128 bytes,
and PCI-E protocol overhead of 20 to 24 bytes, that takes off about 20%,
which leaves you with about 6.5 Gbps of usable bandwidth, which is further
reduced somewhat by the required PCI-E ACK and flow control packets that
accompany the actual data transaction packets.  I am not an expert on
PCI-E but I believe this info to be generally correct.
