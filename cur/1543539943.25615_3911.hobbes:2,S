I dearly hope that we do not see such.  I don't want to see such
a program come out merely to show that we need to block the
hole.  Anyone considering writing such, please, do not release
it.  Releasing such a thing would be equivalent to blowing up an
abortion clinic and killing 400 innocent people just to protest
for "right to live".
I think this whole IDE discussion is really over now.  Everyone
has decided for themselves what they think should be done.  Also,
we know what is/isn't going to be done officially.
Lets just all let it go now, and move on.  Anything that does end
up occuring can be dealt with as it happens...
Take care,
TTYL
