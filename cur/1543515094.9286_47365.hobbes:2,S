Hi,
I have to access on some systemcalls (do_execve) some information (a
linked list of structs), which lies in user-space in a daemon.
It should be in kind of an function-call to user space, but I think
thats not possible.
I saw uaccess, but there I have to know the adress which I have to
access to.
perhaps I can send a signal to the daemon-task, it tells me the address
of the struct via a sys-call, but that seems not very _clean_ to me.
any ideas? thank you
	marcel
