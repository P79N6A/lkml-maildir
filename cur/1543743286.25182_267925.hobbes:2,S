*If* there is room on the CD, you can add things to the image and burn a 
new CD. The "right" method is to mount the CD and copy everything into a 
directory, add the new material, run mkisofs with the right boot options 
to make a bootable image, and burn the image.
If you are heavily into burning CDs, you *MIGHT* be able to extract the 
ISO image, reburn it with the cdrecord -multi option, and then add your 
own stuff in a second session. I haven't tried this, and if you aren't 
familiar with burning multisession CDs it's eather a learning experience 
or a good thing to avoid.
Check first to see if there's any room on the CD for more stuff!
