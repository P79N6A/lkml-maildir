I think Linus has hit the nail on the head here...  The disk systems
(and even individual disks) are getting smarter and smarter, and more
complex.  Naive approaches that try to model these systems and out-guess
them are doomed to death by complexity and failure, in IMHO...
There was a paper at OSDI '99 I didn't pay much attention to at the time 
(never having been an I/O systems guru) that attempts to help this problem 
by various hints getting passed between the disk subsystem and the operating 
system, and the people involved were talking to the disk drive manufacturers 
to try to get them to implement these hints.  I could dig this up out 
of the proceedings if people are immediately interested, though I believe 
the discussion is mostly moot until such disks and controllers start to 
become available. 
My impression at the time I was mostly ignoring the paper was that this 
approach was much more likely to succeed than the "traditional" approaches 
taken by things like the Berkeley FFS layout code, which showed that there 
were problems with the approach about the same time that 4.2BSD shipped, 
as disk controllers were just starting to get smarter (and Digital was 
not very cooperative in describing the disk geometry either, at the time,
with MSCP controllers hiding the geometry of the disks connected to them).
And disks and controllers have only gotten more complex since then...
Was anyone else on this mailing list present and awake enough to remember
the gist of this paper?
Overall, the layout model to maximize performance is getting more and
more complex as the years go by, so lets look for ways the OS and
the disk subsystems can cooperate rather than believe that "the OS is
always right" or the "disk system is always right"...
