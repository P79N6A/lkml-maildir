I dug through my notes a bit, and the interview I was thinking (with one of 
the designers before he died, Jay Minor I think) said that when they did 
upgrade to the 68030 (long after the A1000), they specifically comissioned an 
MMU-less version (68EC030), and that if they'd had to deal with an MMU in the 
first place he doubted they could ever have gotten a microkernel architecture 
to work.
Unfortunately, all I have from said interview at the moment are the notes I 
took.  My first year of computer history research was a learning experience 
about how to do research, back before I learned to store the URL the notes 
came from with the notes (no, the fact it's in my bookmarks list doesn't mean 
I can find it again), and to save pages to my hard drive becaue the links 
have been known to go away over time... :)
On a side note, it's fun looking through the tanenbaum-torvalds debate 
archive and see all the people holding up the amiga as an example of a 
successful microkernel with decent performance, and note the lack of MMU...
