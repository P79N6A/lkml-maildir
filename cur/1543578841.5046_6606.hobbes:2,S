Reading through my mail logs, I know a board, either FIC PA-2011 or FIC
PA-2007 (I seem to have changed my mind somewhere in history) with a
6.4G Quantum Fireball ST, 64MB RAM and an AMD K6-233.  The chipset
reports as VIA VP2/97; sorry, I do not have access to get the PCI IDs.
It locks up with DMA enabled, typically after a few hours, and has done
that since 2.1 kernel days.
Unfortunately it locks up with Mandrake 7.2 which is not very old (based
on 2.2.17 kernels -- it's not my PC any more but I installed Mandrake on
it recently).
Kernel option "ide=nodma" fixes this -- no lockups.
After that "hdparm -X34 -d1" enables DMA and the board remains reliable.
I observed one lockup in several years, while X was starting so it could
have been X.  -X34 does not change the results of "hdparm -t".
Note that "hdparm -X34 -d1" enables old DMA, not UDMA.  (The board was
advertised as UDMA capable but it isn't AFAIK).
enjoy,
