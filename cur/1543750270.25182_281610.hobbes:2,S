It is on properly setup and maintained machines.
The problem are all those people writing programs that think they are doing
the world a favor by screwing with the hostname and various other settings
for us... there's no reason for dhcp to change my hostname.  At least on
linux, no dhcp implementation touches /etc/hosts. (Solaris has screwed up
the hosts file for years.)
These are the same machines that don't have FQDN's as the first name per
entry in /etc/hosts (which pisses off many incarnations of glibc.) *grin*

PS: When you're off-line, /etc/resolv.conf shouldn't have any nameservers
    listed.  They aren't going to be connectable.
