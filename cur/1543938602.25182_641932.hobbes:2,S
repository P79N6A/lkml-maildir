I'd rather avoid touching 2.6.24 unless it actually fixes a bug or
regression...
I'm tempted to actually remove all ifdef's ... if you have a media-bay,
then there are about 99% chances it contains an IDE device, with the
remaining percent being split with putting a floppy or a battery in. I
doubt anybody will care building a kernel without the support for these
and with the mediabay support, and still want to save a handful of bytes
in that driver.
Ben.
