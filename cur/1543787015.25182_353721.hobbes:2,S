Probably not, I had a similar problem recently and for a test case 
copied a .iso image file then compared it to original (cp + cmp), 
turned out to be bad memory, and yes, memtest86 did not find the 
problem.  Check mobo datasheet if 2+ double-sided memory allowed, 
you may need to stay at 1GB to reduce bus loading.
Cheers,
Grant.
