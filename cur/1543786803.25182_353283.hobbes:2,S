Resource limits in Linux, when available, are currently very limited.
i.e.:
Too many process forks and your system may crash.
This can be capped with threads-max, but may lead you into a lock-out.
What is needed is a soft, hard, and a special emergency limit that would 
allow you to use the resource for a limited time to circumvent a lock-out.
Would this be difficult to implement?
Thanks!
