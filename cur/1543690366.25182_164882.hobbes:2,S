Maybe you are mis-interpreting the signature - the information is
'commented out', in the same way that obsolete code is often commented
out.  It could be argued that Andrea used to think that way, but no
longer does, and is trying to spread the message that criticising your
product is 'so last year', and no longer trendy.  We need
clarification on this.
John.
