Well, the interesting parts are missing, because your klogd output has 
been truncated due to the huge output from the md layer etc. However, I 
suspect strongly that the issue is in IO_APIC_get_PCI_irq_vector() in 
arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c, and I would further guess that it's the fact 
that your MP tables don't have the full mapping or we're somehow screwing 
it up.
Can you add a printk() to the case where we return "best_guess" at the end
of that function? We have that fuzzy match thing where if we cannot find
the exact entry in the MP table we instead use the first entry that
matches in everything but the <pin> number, and it would be interesting to
hear if that's the logic that triggers.
It's also quite possible that your MP tables just aren't right, and the
reason XP works on the machine is that XP uses the ACPI irq lookup stuff.  
You could try enabling ACPI bootup support (I've never used it on 2.4.x
myself, but it's required for at least one of my machines and works fine
on 2.5.x).
