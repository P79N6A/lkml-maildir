modutils 2.3.22 does more rigorous checking of MODULE_PARM entries and
has already found several cases where MODULE_PARM(x) is used but the
corresponding variable 'x' is not defined.  These are module coding
bugs that were previously hidden.  Run this script to do a quick check
of all your modules against modutils 2.3.22.  Run as any user, does not
have not be root.
