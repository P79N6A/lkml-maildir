Hello,
since ages owners of a Extensa 50X notebook apply the following diff to the
kernel to make the sound work without hanging the whole system.
I've no idea if anybody ever suggested to put this in the mainstream kernel,
so do I.
Note: I modified the original patch to work with 2.4 but I have no idea if I
did it right, but it works for me(TM).
