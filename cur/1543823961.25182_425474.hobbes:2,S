Yes, not all devices are on a bus, so this will not work.  And we want
to know the driver that controls the device too.  So how about adding
the bus if it's not null?
Something like (untested):
	printk(level "%s %s %s: " format , (dev)->bus ? (dev)->bus->name : "", (dev)->driver ? (dev)->driver->name : "", (dev)->bus_id , ## arg)
