However, the original expression didn't make sense, as LOCKUP is 8 and
!par->dev_flags is either 0 or 1, so `!par->dev_flags & LOCKUP' is
always 0.
I took a quick look at the usage of the LOCKUP flag. Apparently when a
lock-up is detected, this flag is set, and the driver will fall back to
software operations instead of hardware accelerated operations.
Is it possible the intended code was
	if (par->dev_flags & LOCKUP)
		return -ENXIO;
?

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
