The dmesg you posted below doesn't cover the messages from this oops
itself. As you mentioned you can reproduce this oops easily, please do so,
and post the *full* oops log (if it doesn't get logged to disk, you can
try taking digicam photo, or write down *all* the messages and post here).
I built an x86_64 kernel as per your .config, but don't see any memory
dereference at nv_napi_poll+0x108 -- could be toolchain differences.
Else, can you run:
$ gdb ./vmlinux
and then:
(gdb) l *nv_napi_poll+0x108
and send us the output?
