Why?  With my efibootmgr (a userspace app like your
megalib/megamgr/megamon), it looks for the existance of
/sys/whatever/, and then operates with that if it is present.  Else it
looks for the existance of /proc/whatever (in your case
/proc/scsi/scsi) and does likewise.  No driver ioctl needed.

Doing it within the driver means you've got to release a new driver
for each affected OS, to avoid having to update the userspace app on
each OS.  I claim it's much easier to update a userspace lib/app than
it is to update a driver on each installed system.
Thanks,
Matt
