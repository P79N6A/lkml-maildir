Ur... not for TCP.. obviously.
Anyway, is there any advice on how applications that use a single 
socket for raw/udp should deal with this new behaviour? All of the 
link-orientated routing protocol daemons in Quagga/GNU Zebra are 
going to break on Linux with this new behaviour.
Should such applications be changed to open a seperate socket per 
interface? Or could we have a SO_DROP_DONT_QUEUE sockopt to allow a 
privileged application to retain the previous behaviour, or some way 
to flush the queue for a socket?
Using a socket per interface wont address problem of sending quite 
stale packets when a link comes back after a long time down, AUI. 
(not a huge problem - but not nice).
Jeff???
