I have a nagging feeling that we rely on HAL and windows environments
too much nowadays. Last night I tried to susped my laptop while at KDM
prompt but apparently some service is only running in context of user
session and so nothing was there to recognize that suspend button was
pressed (Fedora 8).

That was not my primary goal. We have bitmaps of supported events in
input_dev structure. If we were to reuse KEY_* constants for EV_NOTIFY
then I have to make this bitmap the same size as input_dev->keybit,
which is 512 bit at the moment (and I am thinking that we do need to
extend it to 1024). I expect that we need much less KEY_*_NOTIFY
events so that we could easily fit them into 32 bits.

The problem with this scenario is that userspace can never be sure if
input device is capable of only KEY_BLAH, only KEY_BLAH_NOTIFY or
both. Normally we let userspace query device for all supported events.
