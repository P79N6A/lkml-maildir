Not quite.  Linus uses BK as a tool to facilitate kernel development. 
 However, he has not made BK _part_ _of_ _the_ _kernel_. ;-)  Obviously 
anyone can use any tool ON the kernel, but integrating into the kernel 
is something else.

No need.  His tools are his choice.  The kernel itself is ours not his; 
 thus the distinction.

The GPL has a specific intent which (though use in the kernel is more 
like the LGPL because binary modules are permitted) which doesn't 
explicitly extend to such documentation.  The spirit of the GPL which 
causes us to exclude binary modules from the distribution very much does 
apply.  To a lawyer this might not matter, but I expect more from a top 
free software contributor like you.

In fact I effectively noted its usefulness above.  Thus no argument here.

Note:  you are not quoting me here ;-)  However, I completely agree.

That is a minor detail (as you know).  My suggestion was an attempt to 
balance the value of your admittedly useful document with the nature of 
the endorsement.
