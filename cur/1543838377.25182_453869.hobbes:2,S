Attaching both an i386 version (boot/idle thread only, you did
kernel_thread already)
and an x86-64 one (boot/idle and kernel_thread). The i386 sysenter path
is a different
thing, there we have an actual caller (though outside of the kernel),
which I'd like to
continue to reflect/catch through arch_unw_user_mode().

Add kernel thread stack frame termination for properly stopping stack
unwinds.
One open question: Should these added pushes perhaps be made
conditional upon CONFIG_STACK_UNWIND or CONFIG_UNWIND_INFO?
