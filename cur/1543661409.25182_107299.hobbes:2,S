Is that the temperature when it's halted, or when it's in use?  I have
never observed the Duron 650 machine that's here get above 30 degrees
C, and the MMX-200 doesn't have a temperature sensor, but I'd estimate
that it never goes above 40.

Well, monitor power saving will save power, but not make the case
temperature drop, which is what I assume you are trying to achieve.
