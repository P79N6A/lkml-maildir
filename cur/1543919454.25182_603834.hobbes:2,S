You can't make it conditional on that since a built-in esp_scsi could 
have modular users.
scsi_esp_register() is also buggy since it's impossible that the 
EXPORT_SYMBOL(scsi_esp_register) works in the CONFIG_HOTPLUG=n case when 
it's __devinit - it will always Oops.
Having anything exported __{,dev}{init,exit} is always very likely to be 
buggy.
Patch below.

Since scsi_esp_{,un}register() are EXPORT_SYMBOL'ed, these functions
(and the functions they use) can't be __dev{init,exit}.
Based on a bug report by Rob Landley.
