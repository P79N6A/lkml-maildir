Most likely due to compiler issues:
http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17972
(which turns out to deal with current_thread_info() specifically!)
http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/linux/linux-kernel/2003-22/0265.html
However as I've been interested in this issue since I noticed
AGI stalls (pipeline stalls) in oprofile output on x86 recently
due to very non-parallel "mov    %esp,%eax; and    $0xffffe000,%eax"
sequence (but couldn't think of a way to get rid of this),
I'm going to verify what adding pure does with my >= 4.0.0 gcc on my x86 box.
I'm expecting quite some *general* performance improvement in the
low percentage range here...
(since this would be much more than simply merging multiple "current"
into a local stack variable, since *every* current_thread_info() call
would benefit from this and current_tread_info() is used all over the
place in high-profile call sites)
If this works for >= 4.0.0, then I'll try to add conditional support
for pure etc. in our compiler version dependent infrastructure headers.
Plus, we also access current_thread_info() related things within loops
in some cases; would be much better then to store it in a stack variable
outside, methinks. Or could this conflict with aggressive preemption???
