I've gotten a lot more response to this than I'd ever dreamed, but I
figured out the problem on my own...
I have (had) one of those exhaust fans that fits into a PCI/ISA slot,
and it died.  Not only did it die, but it started creating heat of it's
own.  I don't think the video card adjacent to it appreciated this a
whole lot.  I removed the dead fan, and everything is back to normal, I
just need to go get a new fan to make myself feel better ;-)
The 1007 bios, and ac14 have been perfectly stable, so no worries about
either.
Thanks,
Nathan
