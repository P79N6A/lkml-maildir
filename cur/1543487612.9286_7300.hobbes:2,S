Doing wake_one() is non trivial anyway. But if you put the core 'wake_one'
stuff in place for the kernel then having a select_one() of some form
doesn't break select. Its probably not that useful - its unusual to have
a pile of daemons selecting on one thing with only one to wake - but yes
it does occur
