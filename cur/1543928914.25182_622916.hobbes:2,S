   No, it has not. Any language that looks remotely like an OO language
  has not ever been considered for (Linux) kernel development and for
  most, if not all, other operating systems kernels.
    Various problems occur in an object oriented language. One of them
  is garbage collection: it provokes asynchronous delays and, during
  an interrupt or a system call for a real time task, the kernel cannot
  wait. Another is memory overhead: all the magic that OO languages
  provide take space in memory and Linux kernel is used in embedded
  systems with very tight memory requirements.
    Lots of people will think of better reasons why ObjC is not used...
