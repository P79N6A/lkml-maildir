i thought this problem might have been some strange
occurence, but i've seen it with 2.2.2 2.2.3 and 2.2.3-ac2.
after about 3 days, my modem will not hang up. i've never
had problems with this modem (diamond supra 56) until the
last couple of weeks. any suggestions? what can i do to 
provide more useful info? 
thanks.
