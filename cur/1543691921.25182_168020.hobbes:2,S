Larry, I think you remember the good old days of SunOS, when 16MB of RAM 
was a lot, and people expected less of their hardware. In particular, 
interactive programs used to have a _tiny_ footprint. Often even under X.
Then we put Solaris, Motif and CDE on those suckers, and it was horrible.
Yeah, SunOS was nice. But I really think it's the access patterns that 
changed.
