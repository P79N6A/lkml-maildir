Except that the only driver I'm using is eepro100, and the only change to 
that driver was the patch I submitted myself and which is also in 2.4.
Also, another data point: those two SMP boxes have been running 2.2.18 + 
Andrea's VM-global patch since January, without a hitch.
Ok, so onto the binary search through the 2.2.19pre series...
