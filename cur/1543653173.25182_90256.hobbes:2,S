Hi list,
The current 8139too.c linux kernel driver dosn't work.
There is the patch for the driver 8139too.c at :
http://descript.sysdoor.net/patch/kernel/2.4.19/8139too.c.diff
It fix some problems with card mode, new hard detection and new card
added.
Please read the diff.
PS : There is something strange with the list... or perhaps me ...
Best regards,
Vergoz Michael
