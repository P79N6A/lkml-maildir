There was a proposal recently to increase TASK_COMM_LENGTH from 16 to 20 so
that it was long enough to hold an entire IEEE(?) UUID so that the
operator can easily match up a kernel thread with the storage device which
it manages.
I don't know if/when that change will happen, but the message is that
TASK_COMM_LENGTH may increase.

And if it does, we'll need to increase TS_COMM_LEN as well.  That will
amount to an non-compatible change to the interface which you are
proposing.   We want to avoid that.
Hence I'd propose that you increase TS_COMM_LEN to 32 or something and if
TASK_COMM_LEN later becomes really big, we might just choose to truncate
it.
Or we remove this field altogether, perhaps.  The same info is available
from /proc/pid/stat anyway.  Is it really needed?
