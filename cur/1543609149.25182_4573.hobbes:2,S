Don't mix things :)
We're talking only about the CpuHistory token of the scheduler proposed here:
http://www.xmailserver.org/linux-patches/mss.html
This is a bigger ( and not yet complete ) change on the SMP scheduler
behavior, while it keeps the scheduler that runs on each CPU the same.
I'm currently working on different balancing methods to keep the proposed
scheduler fair well balanced without spinning tasks "too much"(tm).
