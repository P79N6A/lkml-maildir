Hi all! 
I'm running a 2.6.4 kernel with compiled in nfs support. I have to tie the 
used ports because there is a firewall to gro through. mountd, statd and 
rquotad are just fine, I can change ports after booting, no problem. But not 
for lockd (or nlockmgr), since AFAIK this must be done with boot parameters. 
I read the docs and found that the parameters sould be lockd.udpport and 
lockd.tcpport=xxx - but this doesn't work. While booting I got errors that 
both are unknown boot options. 
Where is my mistake? 
Cheers,
Jan
