   Should /dev/console always be available even if there is no
   video card or keyboard on a machine?  I keep getting these
   messages in the logs about init not being able to open(/dev/console)
   when I remove the video card from an embedded box I am working on.
   when I do this strange things start to happen like it cannot properly
   umount /dev/hda5 (not root partition) on shutdown, and mingetty starts
   to respawn to fast.  This is related to a previous message I sent to the
   list about a week ago reguarding the ext2 corruption messages without
   a video card in the machine.  Since then I have upgraded all the libraries
   to be compilant with the rquirements in Documentation/Changes and the 
   corruption has gone away.  Now I am stuck with unclean mounts and other
   random occurences...
If you have an embedded box, your best bet is to redirect the console
output to a serial console.  This allows you to monitor your system
simply and easily simply by attaching an RS-232 cable.
As far as mingetty respawning to fast, that's almost certainly because
you have an entry in /etc/iniitab which for /dev/tty[123456] which isn't
going to exist if you don't have a video card installed.  Edit
/etc/inittab to fix that problem.
