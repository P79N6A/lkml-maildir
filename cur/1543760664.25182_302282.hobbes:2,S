The whole output indicates who has allocated whole pages from the page
allocator. It shows us a bit of the call trace of who allocated it. If
we see that someone has allocated abnormally much memory (considering
how much the caller 'should' have allocated) there is a good chance that
that caller is leaking memory.
This is for example good complete trace:
[0xc0148b9a] do_anonymous_page+170
[0xc0148cdb] do_no_page+75
[0xc0149128] handle_mm_fault+264
[0xc0113625] do_page_fault+501
[0xc0104a7b] error_code+43
The next one here is how it looks when it is not so good:
[0xc013962b] find_or_create_page+91
[0xc01596ac] grow_dev_page+44
[0xc015986a] __getblk_slow+170
[0xc0159c26] __getblk+54
[0xf8ac0a57] +1207
[0xf8abfccd] +61
[0xf8ac03c1] +241
[0xf8ac040a] +42
Stupid me, the 0xf8ac040a addresses are vmalloc space (modules). I need
to look into why it doesn't work with vmalloc but in the meantime, could
you please save a copy of /proc/kallsyms from the computer right away so
that I can look up those when the computer locks up (the copy needs to
be from the current run, addresses can change between reboots).

Thanks for helping to track this down.
