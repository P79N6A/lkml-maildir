Subject: [PATCH 4/28] VFS: Stat shouldn't stop expire
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch fixes the problem where if you have a mountpoint that is going to
expire, it fails to expire before somebody keeps stat(2)ing the root of it's
filesystem.  For example, consider the case where a user has his home
directory automounted on /home/mikew.   Some other user can keep the
filesystem mounted forever by simply calling ls(1) in /home, because the stat
action resets the marker on each call.
