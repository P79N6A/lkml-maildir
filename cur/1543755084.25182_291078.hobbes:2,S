Brice Goglin's patch fixes this.
However, when I modprobe radeonfb I get:
Jan 29 23:38:16 briny kernel: PCI: Unable to reserve mem region #1:8000000@b8000000 for device 0000:00:10.0
Jan 29 23:38:16 briny kernel: radeonfb: probe of 0000:00:10.0 failed with error -16
Not sure if this is expected or not on this platform.
With radeonfb built-in (my current working configuration with 2.6.9)
the screen clears and the machine seems to hang early in the boot.
