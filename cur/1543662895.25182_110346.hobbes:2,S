Browsing the code resulted in a few comments:
this code does at least the following:
1) introducing more sensible names for some constants
2) Moving functionality to mach-default
3) Adding PC9800 functionality
I suggest splitting up the patch in more sensible chunks, and get 1) and 2) applied first.
