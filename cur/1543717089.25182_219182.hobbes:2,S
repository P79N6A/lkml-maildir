But the last time I took a look not even an installer or such. +
Gentoo has no support for custom modifications not even thinking about
a way to group such custom modifications / build configuration into a
well defined way to form a distribution. + ROCK Linux has a real
sandbox build environment, not this optimization via CFLAGS, and so on
Gentoo wannabe.
ROCK Linux is a build kit, allowing to define a set configurations /
modifications to create e.g. special embedded or server distributions
without the need to repackage all the packages and writing a build
script for those ... And when you read some ebuild scripts you find
the ROCK Linux automatics and tag based ASCI package description
format very pleasant, e.g.:
