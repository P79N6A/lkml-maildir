I think my conclusion was that the BIOS was responsible for retrieving the MAC 
from "somewhere" (perhaps a BIOS specific location) and writing it into the 
register that forcedeth users. 
AFAIR, the binary driver only ever accessed the location forcedeth is 
accessing, and it also did the same byte swapping process. I never bothered 
to take the BIOS itelf apart to find out where it was getting the MAC from to 
begin with.
