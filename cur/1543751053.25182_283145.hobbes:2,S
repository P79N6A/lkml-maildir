Sorry, how does hugetlb relate to this?

We need selected nonroot users to be able to run SCHED_FIFO tasks and
mlock().  It has to be easy to administer.  That's it.
As Jack mentioned, the developers of this patch are not kernel hackers
by trade, they wrote this to solve a real problem.  In other words, a
patch is worth a thousand words.
It seems distro vendors would be interested in solving this problem.
The linux audio market is smaller than the general desktop of course but
many of the users are professionals who would gladly pay for support.
Look how many people pay for OSX.  Wouldn't Red Hat and SuSE like some
of those customers?
