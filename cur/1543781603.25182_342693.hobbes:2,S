Yeah, the ptrace split is nice and ABI-like - the system split is more
of a mess.

That may make sense.

Something does, UML doesn't build without one.

Possibly, I don't knowingly use it, but given my borrowing of host
arch headers, and most asm works just as well in UML as on the host,
there could be some use in UML.
