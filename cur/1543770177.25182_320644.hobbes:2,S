Here "man sched_setaffinity" says:
HISTORY
       The affinity syscalls were  introduced  in  Linux  kernel  2.5.8.   The
       library  calls  were  introduced  in  glibc 2.3, and are still in glibc
       2.3.2. Later glibc 2.3.2 development versions changed this interface to
       one without the len field, and still later versions reverted again. The
       glibc prototype is now
       /* Set the CPU affinity for a task */
       extern int sched_setaffinity (pid_t pid, size_t cpusetsize,
                                     const cpu_set_t *cpuset);
       /* Get the CPU affinity for a task */
       extern int sched_getaffinity (pid_t pid, size_t cpusetsize,
                                     cpu_set_t *cpuset);
So looks like you have a version of glibc with a broken interface (and
2.3.5 here has correct prototypes).
