The same is possible within the kernel too! Add default handler to some
unused signals (there are more user-defineable signals than SIGUSR[12]
and noone cares to install handler for them) to do the loop in kernel.
Just make sure, that you call shedule() from time to time in that loop,
because in kernel you can't be preempted as you would in user-space.
