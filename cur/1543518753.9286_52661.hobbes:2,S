BTW I smiled 8)
No uses except for bonding. Those two lines in core/dev.c
will be added to kernel, even if you will not prepare bonding
to time.
if (dev->master)
	skb->dev = skb->dev->master;
dev->slave is misnomer and it shall be removed.
dev->master is correct name and it will be added.

It is pointer to master device, rather than a flag.
