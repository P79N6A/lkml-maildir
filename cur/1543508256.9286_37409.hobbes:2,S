Hi there,
(please cc me, as I am not on the list. No bandwith and not enough time)
my system locks up sometimes already during boot time,
sometimes only after 1 hour, with the following kernels:
2.2.11, 2.2.12,2.3.14,2.3.15, in other words,
with all 2.2.x kernels I have tried out.
sysrq usually still works, but sometimes even this fails.
If I still can get to console 10, usually a scsi time out error occurs.
I have nearly no problems with 2.0.38, exept of one OOPS (see previous
mail).

I did not try out scsi logging information yet to get error reports, if
anyone is
interested in that, please tell me.
