It has gone mainline. Glenn Burkhardt's troubles should now be fixed
for all time, unless io_remap_page_range() itself is in question. I'd
like to carry out a similar conversion on io_remap_page_range() so that
it can have similar safety against physical address overflow. There is
one 32-bit architecture where all IO memory is beyond the 4GB boundary,
and a number where at least some crucial portions of it are. This would
then decide how many arguments io_remap_page_range() takes. There are
some difficulties in this (particularly for the architecture[s] it
would benefit most) so I've been punting on this issue thus far.
