Hi,
      
http://www.treblig.org/Linux_kernel_source_finder.html
  At this address you can find a web page where I'm trying to list the
source of kernel source for all architectures and platforms.
I'm currently missing a good reference for the s390 and cris
architectures and some of the others are guesses on my part.
I'd be greatful for any suggestions/corrections/additions.
I intend to also add pointers to binutils/gcc/etc versions required.
For those architectures which primarily use CVS I'd like to add some
instructions for how to get a 'known good' set of sources (as opposed to
current hackiest).
Enjoy,
Dave
