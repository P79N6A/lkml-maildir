And 2.4 does delayed swap deallocation.  We don't appear to optimize
the case where a page is only used by the swap cache.  That should
be able to save some cpu overhead if nothing else.
And I do know that in the early 2.2 timeframe, swapoff was used
to generate an artifically high VM load, for testing the VM.  It looks
like that testing procedure has been abandoned :)

Agreed.

You would need to handle the shared memory case as well.
But otherwise this looks sound.  I would suggest going
through page->address_space->i_mmap_shared to find all of the
potential mappings but the swapper address space is used by all
processes that have pages in swap.

It looks like it could be.  The bottleneck should be diskio, if it
is not we have a noticeable inefficient algorithm.
