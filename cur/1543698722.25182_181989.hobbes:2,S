leaving mem= off doesnt fix it. Looks like 2.4.18 doesnt even try to map it. As
before, I have attached the entire dmesg's to this email

 Subject: Unable to address 1GB RAM in 2.4.19 or later
I have run into an issue where I cannot address all of my 1GB of RAM. 2.4.18
was the last kernel that can address all 1GB. All kernels since then appear to
only be able to address 16mb of ram if I use the 4GB himem kernel option. Here
is a snip of the dmesg on the working 2.4.18 and broken 2.4.23 kernels:

What concerns me about these is that even in the 2.4.18 kernel it only reports
128MB HIGHMEM in the dmesg, even though it does see all 1GB when booted (free
confirms this). I am thinking 2.4.18 isnt detecting something properly either,
but is only a problem in 2.4.19 and later.
Both are SMP kernels. The hardware is a Compaq Proliant 5000R, quad pentium pro
200mhz (256k cache models).
Any thoughts on this? Is there any other information needed to address this
issue? Please let me know what I can do to assist in correcting this bug.
