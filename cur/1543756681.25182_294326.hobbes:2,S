First off, not everyone wants to use udev (I know, horrible thought...)
This provides those people a solution to a "I want a tiny /sbin/hotplug"
problem.
Also, udevstart working as /sbin/hotplug is great for keeping things in
order, which is important during normal operation.  But during the boot
sequence, the odds of getting out-of-order events, or even remove
events, is somewhat limited.  So, this /sbin/hotplug replacement can
work in an initrd/initramfs image when udevstart would be overkill.
And finally, even if you do use udevstart to manager /sbin/hotplug
events, you still need a module autoloader program.  This package
provides executables for that problem, if you don't want to (or you
can't) use the existing linux-hotplug scripts.  udev will never do the
module loading logic, so there's no duplication in this case.
Hope this helps.  I do realize the whole hotplug process is getting a
bit complicated.  I hope to write up some good documentation on what all
is involved to help clear up some of the confusion that the combination
of udev, udevsend, udevd, hal, /etc/hotplug.d/, /etc/dev.d/,
and /sbin/hotplug have caused lately.
thanks,
