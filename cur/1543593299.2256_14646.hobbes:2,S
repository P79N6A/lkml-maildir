IMHO, you want AIO.  SGI's is fine for now.  I hear rumors that there will be
something even better coming in 2.5, though I have no details.
Or you could use explicit userspace threads... say, divide up your
network connections among 8 or so threads.  Then if one thread blocks,
the others are there to usefully soak up the CPU time.
Readiness events for readahead completion on disk files used to 
seem like a neat idea to me, but now AIO seems more appealing
in the long run, since they handle random access properly.
