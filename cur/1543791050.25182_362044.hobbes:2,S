Still, it is a change in behaviour that I would rather not introduce
with a cleanup patch (and is something we don't want to introduce anyway).
So if you could fix that up it would be good.

Well page_zone is yet another cacheline that doesn't need to be touched,
and that is introduced by this patch. But the line is likely to be hot,
and get_page_from_freelist does not have the required 'zonelist' which
I didn't notice before.
So OK, revisit this later.
