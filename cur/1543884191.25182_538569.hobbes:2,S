"invariably"?
Do you know whether the current version of GCC generates poor code for pointer
subtraction?
If so, does anything in particular make this an unfixable problem?
Has anyone reported this poor code generation to the GCC bugzilla?  If so, I
can add a reference to the bug in any (hypothetical) documentation for
-Wptr-subtraction-blows.

Regardless of whether it addresses a current GCC issue or not, I have no
problem leaving the warning in if people want it, given that it requires an
explicit switch.
