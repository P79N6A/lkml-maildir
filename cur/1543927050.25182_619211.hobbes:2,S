Still needs the following update, IMO ... 
======	CUT HERE
A recent patch added software synchronization during EHCI startup,
so ports aren't switched away from the companion controllers after
resets have started.  This patch adds a short delay letting hardware
get a chance to finish that port switching before any new resets begin.
That is, both sides of that hardware race window need to be closed.
