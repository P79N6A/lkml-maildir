  The fork connector is not related to accounting. It's a connector that
allows to send information to a user space application when a fork
occurs in the kernel.
  This information is used by ELSA by I think that this hook will be
used by some others user space applications and IMHO, it's not
incompatible with a specific hook for accounting tool if needed.
