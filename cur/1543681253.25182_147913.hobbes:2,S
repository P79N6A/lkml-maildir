That's not the only siginfo_t problem:
	- Take a look at the placement of the _uid32 field on m68k.
	  It varies from sub-structure to sub-structure - yet it is
	  always written to the same offset by the kernel.  Borken!
Other cleanups:
	- SI_* codes on S390 are identical to the generic ones.
	  They can be removed from the S390 file.
	- Comment in MIPS siginfo about IRIX compatibility is no
	  longer true; the layout was changed when uid32 added.
	- __ARCH_SI_UID_T can be removed.  Only Sparc sets it,
	  and to the same type as uid_t (unsigned int).
