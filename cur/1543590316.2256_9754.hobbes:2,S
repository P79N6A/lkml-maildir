yeah, it didn't triggered because it probably needs to be the same page
writepaged and in the dirty list at the same time. I hooked it very deep
into the writeback logic to keep it generic (it wasn't going to add a
significant overhead) but it didn't need to be _that_ deep.
Even worse I think it was partly wrong because it was only in the
close(2) path but not in the fput path that is the one walked by munmap.
This looks better to me, what do you think?
