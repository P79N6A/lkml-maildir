Subject: [patch 6/8] CAN-2005-2098 Error during attempt to join key management session can leave semaphore pinned
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any  objections, please let us know.
------------------
from hanging future joins in the D state [CAN-2005-2098].
The problem is that the error handling path for the KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING
operation has one error path that doesn't release the session management
semaphore. Further attempts to get the semaphore will then sleep for ever in
the D state.
This can happen in four situations, all involving an attempt to allocate a new
session keyring:
 (1) ENOMEM.
 (2) The users key quota being reached.
 (3) A keyring name that is an empty string.
 (4) A keyring name that is too long.
Any user may attempt this operation, and so any user can cause the problem to
occur.
