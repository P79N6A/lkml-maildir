Well I got the e-mail from Alan Cox, thought it was a little terse, but it
did focus me on the initrd, went and read the initrd.txt again, and found
that Alan's e-mail spoke volumes.
Like Alan suggested I squeezed and I got lilo, the kernel, and an initrd
fs containing a static busybox on 1 floppy.

So, I ended up where you did, 1 floppy with enough tools to load any other
floppy with anything else I need.
Which brings me to my next stumbling block.  The NIC that I have now (got
an internal mini-pci one coming next week) is a PC Card.  That is
something else I've never messed with.  I built the driver (3c574) into
the kernel, but from what I'm seeing that isn't enough?  I also need the
pcmcia-cs userland tools?  (I'm reading the PCMCIA-HOWTO now.)  I guess
this wouldn't seem too strange to me if I was still running 2.2 and needed
the isapnp userland stuff, but that has been included in the kernel.  So
what is the deal with PC Cards?
Well I've got more reading to do.
Thanks again,
Chris
