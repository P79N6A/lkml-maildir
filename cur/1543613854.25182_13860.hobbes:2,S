Dunno, just tried this on my box which has a 5400 RPM disk in and got 
[root@smeg lpackham]# /sbin/hdparm -t /dev/hdc
7200RPM on the on board
/dev/hdc:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  3.94 seconds = 16.24 MB/sec
[root@smeg lpackham]# /sbin/hdparm -t /dev/hdg
7200RPM on a promise Ultra ATA 66
/dev/hdg:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  3.02 seconds = 21.19 MB/sec
[root@smeg lpackham]# /sbin/hdparm -t /dev/hda
5400RPM on the on board
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  4.23 seconds = 15.13 MB/sec
