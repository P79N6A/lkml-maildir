That's sidestepping the *real* issue - which is that you need reasonable semantics
even if you don't have cdfs or whatever special gee-wizz-bang driver handy.
Consider an embedded system - it may have iso9660 support, and boot off a CD
like Knoppix, but not have cdfs.  What do you do then?
(For bonus points, figure out the security issues involved in dealing with an intentionall
corrupted image on a CD......)
