These aren't too shabby, but then again compared to my NVidia (non-rt
obviously) with their binary driver):
0000:01:05.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV40 [GeForce
6800 GT] (rev a1)
$ glxgears
49961 frames in 5.0 seconds = 9992.200 FPS
48599 frames in 5.0 seconds = 9719.800 FPS
55592 frames in 5.0 seconds = 11118.400 FPS
47395 frames in 5.0 seconds = 9479.000 FPS
What do you get with the ATI binary driver?

Sorry, I can't help you there. I don't have access to IE or Quicken
(well, it's on my wife's computer, but she won't let me put Linux on
it! :-(
