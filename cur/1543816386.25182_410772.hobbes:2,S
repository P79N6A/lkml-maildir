Only 32-bit x86 arch implements both. We get away by not having DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
feature on any other arch.
I read the ia32 processor manual, it says the pse flag in CR4 controls
4K/4M mapping in addition to pse bit in page directory entry.  But in
PAE mode, cr4.pse is ignored and pse bit in pmd controls 4K/2M mapping.
I was going to verify that on my ia32 box, but apparently, turning on
64G highmem gives me machine reset at boot. (is it a known regression?)
X86-64 surly ignores cr4.pse for 4K/2M mapping. It is solely controlled
by pse bit in pmd.
