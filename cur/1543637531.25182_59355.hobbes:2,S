The POSIX clocks & timers API defines CLOCK_MONOTONIC for
this sort of thing (CLOCK_MONOTONIC can not be set).  It
also defines an API for clock_nanosleep() that CAN use an
absolute time which is supposed to follow any clock setting
that is done.  Combine the two and you have a fixed time
definition.
AND, guess what, the high-res-timers patch does all this and
more.
