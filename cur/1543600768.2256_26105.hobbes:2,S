Well, he didn't mention the amperage outputs, but he said 431W Enermax, 
from what I hear Enermax PSU's are good.
I still have trouble dealing with the idea that the optimizations cause 
power consumption like this, but then, I have trouble with my own idea 
that it causes sufficient heat increase in the chipset that soon after 
boot.
Do most people that experience this problem also experience after a 
cold-boot where the system had been off for at least 10-15 minutes? And 
has ANYONE sucsesfully cured this problem by changing power supplies?
