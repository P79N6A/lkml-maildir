FYI, this patch should be removed from the internet archives and the
author should be made liable for the damage which can happen when
innocent users try to use it for fixing things which simply can not be
fixed.

Aside of this worst case scenario, disabling SMIs is problematic as
SMI is used to emulate devices, to fix chip bugs and necessary for
enhanced features.
The only reasonable thing you can do on a SMI plagued system is to
identify the device which makes use of SMIs. Legacy ISA devices and
USB are usually good candidates. If that does not help, don't use it
for real-time :)
