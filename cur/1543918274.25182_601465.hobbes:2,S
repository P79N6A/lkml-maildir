ok
It's a deal.
I've got a couple of brown paper bag bug fixes almost ready to send
out, for the patch I sent Andrew a few days ago:
  cpuset and sched domains: sched_load_balance flag
I'll send these in, and then get some sleep and code up these changes
to the partition_sched_domains, along the lines you have recommended.
Thanks, Nick and Ingo.
