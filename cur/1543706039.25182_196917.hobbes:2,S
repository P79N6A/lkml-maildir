Hi,
Has anyone had any luck getting PATA working on Promise PDC20378
controllers in a 2.6.x kernel?  As far as I can determine from
looking at the drivers and at 2-month old postings to linux-kernel,
the sata_promise driver only handles the two SATA ports and not the
PATA port.  The Promise-supplied TX2plus driver works (with PATA
support) for 2.4.x but hasn't been updated for 2.6.x.
I fear the answer is still no, but I hate being limited to only 4
PATA devices when I've got 5 sitting in there :)
Thanks,
Dan Hopper
