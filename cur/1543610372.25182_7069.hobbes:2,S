Well, you seem to have a buggered BIOS - the oops is actually in the BIOS
segment, and the BIOS appears to try to re-load the ES segment register
with some strange non-existing segment.
Your BIOS PCI irq routing routines probably only work in real-mode or
something like that.
This is the reason Linux avoids BIOS calls like the plague, and why you
have to ask for them explicitly - the likelihood of any random BIOS being
broken is actually rather high. That's probably because
 - the BIOS is written mostly in assembly
 - the BIOS is tested exclusively with DOS and Windows
 - most BIOS writers appear to simply be incompetent, or just not care.
Not a good combination, in short.
I'd love to just remove the support for BIOS calls entirely, but for every
ten broken machines there is one machine that actually works, so..
