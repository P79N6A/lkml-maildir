I don't see what the big deal is. Arithmetic in Z/2**32Z or whatever
doesn't really define a comparison, we just artificially impose our
favorite residues and have to check various preconditions for the
results of comparisons to make sense (which obviously aren't checked
in your example of garbage produced by a comparison).
You are right in that some attempt at an audit should be done if it
were to be changed, of course. I generally think of it as easy, and
assume it will be done.
