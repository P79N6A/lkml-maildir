<trond.myklebust@fys.uio.no> (03/05/07 1.1098)
   UDP and TCP zero copy code for the NFS client. The main interest
   of this patch is to eliminate the use of xdr_kmap() and xdr_unmap()
   by replacing them with MSG_MORE. xdr_kmap() is deadlock-prone
   due to the fact that it has to kmap() several pages at the same time.
<trond.myklebust@fys.uio.no> (03/05/07 1.1097)
   Ensure that Lockd and the NSM (statd) clients always use privileged
   ports. Remove the existing code to temporarily raise privileges in
   fs/lockd/host.c, and use the new code in net/sunrpc/xprt.c
   
   There should no longer be a need to temporarily change the fsuid.
   Remove this feature.
<cel@citi.umich.edu> (03/05/07 1.1096)
   the recently-applied patch to fix the rpc_show_tasks() Oops is incomplete.
   this applies over 2.5.68 and should address all of the issues in
   rpc_show_tasks().
<trond.myklebust@fys.uio.no> (03/05/07 1.1095)
   Add the sk->callback_lock spinlocks to the RPC socket callbacks
   in order to protect the socket from being released by one
   CPU while the other is in a soft interrupt.
<trond.myklebust@fys.uio.no> (03/05/07 1.1094)
   Ensure that if we need to reconnect the socket, we also resend
   the entire RPC message
   
   Assorted TCP reconnection fixes.
   
   Temporarily raise the necessary CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE capability
   if we need to bind the socket to a reserved port during a TCP
   reconnection. Check for CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE at mount time.
<trond.myklebust@fys.uio.no> (03/05/07 1.1093)
   Don't use an RPC child process when reconnecting to a TCP server.
   This is more efficient, and also fixes an existing deadlock
   situation in which the child could be waiting for an xprt_write_lock
   that was being held by the parent.
<trond.myklebust@fys.uio.no> (03/05/07 1.1092)
   Fix a TCP race: check whether or not the socket has been disconnected
   before we allow an RPC request to wait on a reply.
<trond.myklebust@fys.uio.no> (03/05/07 1.1091)
   Fix typos in close-to-open cache consistency checking.
<trond.myklebust@fys.uio.no> (03/05/07 1.1090)
   Decrement the nr_unstable page state after the COMMIT RPC call
   completes instead of before. This ensures that writeback 
   WB_SYNC_ALL does wait on completion.
   
   Don't overreport the number of pages we wrote out. It is safer to
   underreport.
   
   Fix missing NFSv3 unstable write accounting in fs/fs-writeback.c
   and mm/page-writeback.c
