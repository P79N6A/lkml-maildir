I have been seeing a similar thing:
./current:Sep 17 18:00:01 [kernel] mkdir[7696]: segfault at 
0000000000000000 rip 000000000040184d rsp 00007fffff826350 error 4
I'm using the plain 2.6.13 (from gentoo vanilla sources), though it 
was compiled with
gcc version 3.4.4 (Gentoo 3.4.4-r1, ssp-3.4.4-1.0, pie-8.7.8)
