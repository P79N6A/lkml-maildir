It would be great if we could clarfiy DVB maintainership. It would
nice to "appoint" one maintainer to whom we should send the
patches. If no one else volunteers, we will send them to you directly,
if you want with Cc: to lkml.
Alan Cox was the first one to merge the DVB subsystem into his 2.5 kernel
tree, but hinted that future updates should be sent in your direction.
Maybe that was just because he was busy with the IDE drivers, maybe
there are other reasons. I don't know.
The code base for the DVB drivers has grown over the last 3..4 years,
and there was a lot of stuff we wanted to clean up before inclusion in
the kernel. The pre-halloween merge was somewhat too soon, and there
were considerable cleanups afterwards which resulted in rather large
patches. Even after this current patch set, there is already a pile of
stuff to be merged. But the drivers in our CVS are already in a stable
condition, so future patches might be smaller ;-)
Thanks,
Johannes
