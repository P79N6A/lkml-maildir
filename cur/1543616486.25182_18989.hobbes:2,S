I can confirm that the JFFS2 and PPP zlib are compatible - differing in 
cosmetics only. Moving it to lib/zlib would be a good thing.
We can verify compatibility for other zlib users as an when those other
users are converted to use lib/zlib instead of their own private copy.

AUIU you've since decided this isn't necessary - which is good. Making the
static kernel image differ according to which modules happened to be
compiled at the time is not a good thing. Sometimes we do it, but we should
avoid it when we can.
If zlib.o is used in modules only, compile it as a module. Don't put it 
into the kernel.
