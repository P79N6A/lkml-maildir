IIRC there was such patch not very long ago and it was rejected (to not 
make kernel larger or something like that...). But I can be wrong.
I think that all data from /proc that are not user-process data should be 
exported using sysfs or something similar. Maybe even in future one will 
write userspace fs (using FUSE?) to emulate old /proc entries using sysfs 
exported data. This will allow removing all proc code from kernel. Maybe 
even user processes data should be exported using sysfs (like 
/sys/processes/123/maps/41610000/file)? But this is my personal opinion.
