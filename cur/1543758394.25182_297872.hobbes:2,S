Hi!
I tried cross-compiling ethertap.c with
linux-sh-2.4.18, but can not successfully make it.
TOPDIR was set as /usr/src/linux-sh-2.4.18
CROSS_COMPILE   =sh4-linux-
CC              = $(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc
the compilation errors are:
--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
what could be the possible problem in here?
basing on this compile log, i am expecting that: 
(for example)
/usr/include/asm/system.h
to be
/usr/src/linux-sh-2.4.18/include/asm/system.h
I know that there is no need to touch the Makefiles,
Rules.make for this, but I also tried replacing all
$(TOPDIR) to /usr/src/linux-sh-2.4.18.
The result was still the same.
I already ran make dep, make clean, and still got the
same result.
And also to my surprise, 
/usr/src/linux -> linux-sh-2.4.18
/usr/src/linux-sh-2.4.18
doing a : 
cd linux
would result to:
/usr/src/linux   instead of   /usr/src/linux-sh-2.4.18
has anyone experienced this?
if so, can this be explained as to why this is the
result?
hoping for some insights on how to proceed with my
compilation problem.
thank you.
donald
