Problem: pci_update_resource doesn't exist for sparc64.

I have reformulated the patch to account for these comments, but I am
not currently using pci_update_resource for the reason stated above.
I'll go ahead and post the new patch for comment.  If we can resolve

or additional) patch to cover that.  Patch to follow...
Thanks!
John
