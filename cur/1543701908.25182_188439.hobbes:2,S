I'm trying to investigate that right now. In 2.2, mremap() doesn't yet
take yet the new_addr argument, therefore the "official" 2.4 fix
wouldn't apply at all to it. There are four possibilities:
* The isec.pl guys just made a mistake.
* 2.2's get_unmapped_area() can return dangerous pages for len == 0,
whilst the 2.4's get_unmapped_area() cannot. (I'm not sure, looking into
that code right now.)
* 2.4's fix is incorrect.
* I'm missing something obvious.
Anyone has an idea?
