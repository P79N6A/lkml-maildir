What about the existing POSIX test suite from X/Open?  I don't know what
the current license is, but it is certainly freely downloadable from
their website.  However, it is a pain in the a** to set up and run, so
a new version would definitely be welcome.
I would give you a URL, but I don't have access to my mail archives now.
Cheers, Andreas
