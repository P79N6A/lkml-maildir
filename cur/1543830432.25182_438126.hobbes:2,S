I currently use it as a replacement for initrd that uses approx 1/2
the RAM (maybe less when I get around to changing CONFIG_MINIX_FS to
module).
I couldn't care less about kinit right now as I run dash there, but it
could be useful if root= support is removed.
BTW, is there a kinit= kernel command line so I can spawn an
interactive shell rather than /init?  init= doesn't do it.
