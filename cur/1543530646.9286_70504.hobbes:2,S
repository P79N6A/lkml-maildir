Many architectures don't know of read-only data, so you must consider them
writeable anyway. Shared libraries often live in writeable segments, as
addresses need to be fixed up. And it is the case that writeable stuff is
shared (on fork(2), each single time). Might be short-lived, but without
overcommit it HAS to be available _now_. With overcommit you can hope that
not every other user does cash in immediately on reserved memory, or that
some other process exits and frees some before you need it. Marking
"de-facto read only by the process" is error-prono, and will be done wrong
enough of the time it will be taken back. OOM is rare, program chrashing
because "I thought read-only but overlooked..." will be frequent.
Next time go ask your bank if they have the cash handy for the case that
everybody decides to close their accounts the same day.
