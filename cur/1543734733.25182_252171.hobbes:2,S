Unfortunately we need to keep the cond_rescheds that are called under
the bkl. Otherwise yes, this would be nice to be able to do.

Which is why we don't need more of them ;)

Well I don't know how good an argument the crashes one is these days,
but generally (as far as I know) those who really care about latency
shouldn't mind about some extra overheads.
Now I don't disagree with some cond_rescheds for places where !PREEMPT
latency would otherwise be massive, but cases like doing cond_resched
for every page in the scanner is something that you could say is imposing
overhead on people who *don't* want it (ie !PREEMPT).

:) I don't think Ingo intended this for merging as is. Maybe it is to
test how much progress he has made.
