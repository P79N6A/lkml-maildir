Hello,
I'm back with another annoying announcement and post of my "lock stat"
patches for Ingo's 2.6.19-rt14 patch. I want review, comments and
eventually inclusion into the -rt.
Changes in this release:
- forward ported to 2,6.19-rt14
- rt_mutex_slowtrylock() path now works with lock stat after an
initialization check. Apparently there's a try-lock some where before
my lock stat stuff is initialized and it hard crashes the machine on
boot. This is fixed now.
- Addes a new field to track adaptive spins in the rtmutex as a future
feature.
