As a general thing? No, I don't think so. When you've made a change
you generally want to compile test a very specific part of the kernel
(the one containing your change), not the entire kernel.

No need to hack makefiles, for example, all I did to build my 100
kernels was this simple shell script that I then left to run for a few
hours :
#!/bin/bash
make clean
zcat /proc/config.gz > .config
make oldconfig
cp .config normal.config
make -j 5 2>&1 | tee normal.log
make clean
make defconfig
cp .config def.config
make -j 5 2>&1 | tee def.log
make clean
make allmodconfig
cp .config allmod.config
make -j 5 2>&1 | tee allmod.log
make clean
make allnoconfig
cp .config allno.config
make -j 5 2>&1 | tee allno.log
make clean
make allyesconfig
cp .config allyes.config
make -j 5 2>&1 | tee allyes.log
for i in `seq 1 95`; do make clean ; make randconfig ; cp .config
rand$i.config ; make -j 5 2>&1 | tee rand$i.log ; done
no tricky Makefile hackery there, just a little shell scripting magic.
