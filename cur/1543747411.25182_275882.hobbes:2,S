Allocation won't fail! There's overcommit! Pagefault won't OOM, because
it will wait for the pages to get laundered. And the pages won't get
laundered untill the pagefault suceeds. (Yes, I know that you are going
to mark the pages as dirty again so the pagefault won't wait for them,
but you have to mention it.)
