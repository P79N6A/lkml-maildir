Subject: [PATCH] add note about verify_area removal to Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/6/13/205

Add note about the soon-to-come removal of verify_area() to 
Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt, so it can be clearly 
deprecated *and* documented to go away real-soon-now in 2.6.12 (if there's 
time to push it to Linus before 2.6.12 hits).
This was already in -mm earlier, but some duplicate patch submission 
(error on my part) caused it to be messed up and then removed.
