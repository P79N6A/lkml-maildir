I've been receiving messages in my logs regarding a reiserfs partition I 
have on my system.  At first, I thought that one of my drives was going 
bad, so I really didn't pay it much attention.  Now that I look closer, 
however, I notice this:
Feb 26 00:02:39 JTLinux kernel: hdb: drive not ready for command
Feb 26 00:02:52 JTLinux kernel: hdb: lost interrupt

. . . These messages are repeated a whole lot . .

_________________
Now, the statement that says: want=596901940, limit=8255488 worries me.  
This is an 8.4gig Western Digital drive, so the number, 8255488 seems 
reasonable enough.  The number 596901940 seems totally unreasonable.  Do 
you think I am looking at a hardware problem, or do you think it could 
be kernel related?  I am using kernel 2.4.1 on a SuSE Linux 7.0 system.
Thanks in advance,
Justin
