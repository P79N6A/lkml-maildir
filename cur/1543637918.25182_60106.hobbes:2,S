No problem :)

ok, so you had the dependency v1 == v2, so you were also implicitly
comparing v2 with the new version 1 ok.

there's no preempt in 2.4, the comment was meant for anybody foward
porting it to 2.5.

Randy didn't report any decrease in performance, so in normal loads 
shouldn't be noticeable.

I would say dbench is a good candidate for this kind of change to verify
it's not noticeable.
then you could test two parallel reads on the same inode, for example
two parallel dd if=file of=/dev/null reading from cache, and see if
there's a difference of bandwidth with cmpxchg8b and ordered
read/writes (on a 4p you could try with 4 parallel dd).

ok, as said the int granularity is going to be atomic for all archs.
