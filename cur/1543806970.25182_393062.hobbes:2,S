Certainly the BIOS writer also had access to that document, plus
documents we do not see, yet they decided NOT to enable C2/C3.

Who defines the "right way"?  Is it guaranteed to work on all
models and all configurations?  Exactly what is the reward
for the cost we'd be paying and the risk we'd be taking?

How about if we put it this way...
If the ACPI maintainer were an AMD employee,
and he accepted a patch like this specific to Intel hardware --
a patch that rejects whatever validation Intel, the BIOS
vendor and the board vendor have put into the product --
I'd call for his expulsion for ineptitude.
If somebody from AMD steps forth and says that hey, their hardware
is broken if used in the standard way, but that this "logic around"
is a valid model-specific workaround -- then we have something
that MAYBE we can work with.  Otherwise, do whatever works for your
own system, but it would be reckless of us to put stuff like this
in the upstream kernel and then ask distros to support it.
