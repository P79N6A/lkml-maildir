Bad RAM can be extremely reproducable though, and can certainly produce
SEGVs.
Evidence: I recently had a bad 128MB SDRAM which *always* failed at byte
address 0x220068, which was the middle of the mem_map array.  All I
needed to do was 'dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/null' and the machine would
die within 5 minutes due to an invalid buffer_head pointer.
The SDRAM naturally passed each and every single memory test I could
throw at it.  However, a new SDRAM fixed the problem.
It is quite common for SDRAMs to fail in this way - think about the
failure mode.  Some of the silicon in the SDRAM is damaged.  This isn't
going to move about, so its going to be in a fixed position.  A fixed
position means a specific set of transistors, gate, and therefore
memory location.
In answer to the original posters question, the first step would be
to grab a copy of memtest86 (iirc its a program that is run from floppy
disk) and run that on your system.  That /should/ (and I stress should
there) detect any RAM problems you have.
