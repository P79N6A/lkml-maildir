Isn't this still the problem of storing fs metadata within a potentially
corrupt fs? I think storing the backup superblock locations outside the fs
would be a good idea. Is it possible to add an option to tune2fs to report
this info so one could store it on a floppy or print it or something?
I've noticed another anomaly. When mke2fs 1.18 creates a 1.3GB partition, it
says the first backup superblock is at 32768 not 32769. Is this an off-by-one
error?
