Interesting. I don't know how much smaller the timeslice can be before 
different hardware will be affected. Can you report what cpu and video card 
you're using? Unfortunately I don't have a range of hardware to test it on 
and I chose the aggressive 1/5th timeslice size. Can you try with ISO_PENALTY 
set to 2 instead?

Transparency and antialiased fonts are good triggers. Launcing Xterm with 
transparency has been known to cause skips. Also the obvious make -j 4 kernel 
compiles, and 
while true ; do a=2 ; done
as a fast onset full cpu hog

Anything that increases the signal to noise ratio at helping us pick up 
skips/problems is useful, but this can help those that _don't_ want skips so 
thanks.

Thank you very much for testing and reporting.
