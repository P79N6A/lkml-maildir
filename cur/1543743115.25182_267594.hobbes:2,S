I don't think so. There are multiple attempts to build a better
generic scheduler (Con's for one), so there's your counterexample right
here. However, testing a different scheduler currently requires a kernel
recompile and a reboot.
I hate that. Ideally, the scheduler would be hotpluggable... but I can
live with a reboot. I don't think a kernel recompile to switch schedulers
makes sense, though, so I for one am likely not to bother. So far.
You can't actually develop a better scheduler if people need to go too
far out of their way to compare them.
