Hello all,
	Just fired up 2.4.0-test7 and immediately had it Opps on me
just after initializing IPv6.  Tried two different compiles and it bombs.
Turned IPv6 off and recompiled and 2.4.0-test7 comes right up.
	2.4.0-test6 does not exhibit the problem.
	This is just an initial "heads up".  I don't have the Oppss at this
time.  If it will help, I'll get it, but I have to copy it down by hand
since it fails so early in the boot and I don't have a serial console on
the box.
	I'm going to do a recompile with IPv6 as a module and see what
happens when I load the module...
	Mike
