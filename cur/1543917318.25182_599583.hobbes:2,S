Sorry, but I don't think that will work.
It seems that I am able to reproduce the bug, but not reliable. And my
current best guess to make it happen involves the step "leaf the
computer powered off for 8 hours".
I estimate that even with the 8 hour pause only at ~50% of the boots
one drive fails. So I have no safe point to mark a bisect step as
'good'.

Known good is for me 2.6.23-rc3-mm1, the first known bad is 2.6.23-rc4-mm1.
I will try to look at the diff between these revisions some more, but
the change in sata_sil24.c looked like a perfect match for the
symptoms I was seeing.
What I just noticed, as I wanted two re-add the drive to the RAID:
This time it was not sda, but sdb that was kicked. But otherwise the
errors are perfectly identical.
I will try to make a 2.6.23-rc3.5-mm1 to narrow it down some more...
