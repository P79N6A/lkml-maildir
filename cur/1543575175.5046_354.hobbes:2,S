Please refer to page 6-16, Inter486 Microprocessor Family Programmer's
Reference Manual.
The specifc text is: "The TSS does not have a stack pointer for a
privilege level 3 stack, because the procedure cannot be called by a less
privileged procedure. The stack for privilege level 3 is preserved by the
contents of SS and EIP registers which have been saved on the stack
of the privilege level called from level 3".
What this means is that a stack-fault in level 3 will kill you no
matter how cute you try to be. And, putting a task gate as call
procedure entry from a trap or fault is just trying to be cute.
It's extra code that will result in the same processor reset.
