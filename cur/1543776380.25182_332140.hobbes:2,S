hi Alexey,
Thanks for the constructive comments.
> And check for non-NULL data in at91_add_device_usbh() is useless:
There are many more custom AT91RM9200-based boards.  That NULL check is
really just there to help the developers when they write their own
board-XX.c file.

All the other watchdog drivers use ioctl?  That is how it's described in
Documentation/watchdog/watchdog-api.txt.

That command buffer is passed down to the SPI driver, which then DMA's
directly from/to it.  We can't DMA to an address on the stack (atleast
not in 2.4 when that driver was written).
