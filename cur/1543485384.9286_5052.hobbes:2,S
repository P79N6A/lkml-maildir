Subject: 2.2.2pre2: hard drive interrupt problems continue
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

I've been asked to post a followup regarding a problem seen with IDE hard
drives under the 2.2 series.  Bibek Sahu <scorpio@dodds.net> posted to the
list on 3 Feb, outlining the failure as it occurs under 2.2.1.  We've
tested under 2.2.2pre2, with similar results.
Under 2.2.1, the server would consistently stop talking to its hard drive
after about 2 hours 45 minutes.  Under 2.2.2pre2, no problems were
experienced until appx. 22 hours after boot.  Then the kernel gives an
"hda: lost interrupt" error and the hard drive becomes inaccessible,
requiring us to reboot.
The remaining information is copied verbatim from the previous post.
The machine in question is a 486 dx4/100 using a UMC8886BM ide controller.
It has ISA and PCI, and I think even a VLB slot (unused). The hard drive
in question is a Western Digital WD34000L (4GB).  From 2.0.36:
hda: WDC AC34000L, 3815MB w/256kB Cache, CHS=7752/16/63
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
The most recent configuration has IDE DMA disabled, and ide0=umc8672.
Prior to that, we booted w/o ide dma in the kernel, and w/o using the
umc8672 stuff (both of these had support for most of the chipset
workarounds).  Prior to those, the 2.2 kernels we built had support for
ide dma, but hdparm indicated that the dma was not being used.
The /proc/pci is attached, as is /proc/cpuinfo.
Insights, patches, etc. are welcome.
Thanks,
