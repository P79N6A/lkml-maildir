Yes, the whole code is very interesting. From add_to_page_cache()
we call radix_tree_preload with __GFP_HIGHMEM cleared, but
from __add_to_swap_cache(), we don't make any changes to the
gfp_mask. radix_tree_preload() calls kmem_cache_alloc() and in slub
there is a check
        BUG_ON(flags & GFP_SLAB_BUG_MASK);
So, I guess all our allocations should check against __GFP_DMA and
__GFP_HIGHMEM. I'll review the code, test it and send a fix.
