I'm trying to understand how to specifically support PCI-X hardware in my
driver.
Code-wise, do I treat a PCI-X device the same as a PCI device in my
hardware detection routine, or are there additional things I need to do?
If anyone could point me to some example code, it'd probably answer all my
questions.
Thanks!
