Hello 
Here comes the Test report for the UML SKAS and User run Tests
If I run the UML Kernel without the HOSTS SKAS Patch, it works normally, no hd
shutdown!
If i run the UML Kernel with the HOSTS SKAS Patch but as "normal" user, it works
also normally, without any harddisk shutdown!
It seems more and more to be a kind of bug in the UML Patch which allows the uml
kernel to call kernel functions on the host kernel.
