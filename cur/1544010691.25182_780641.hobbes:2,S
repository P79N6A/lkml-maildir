Yes. Can the memoryless node revert to a default (closest) memory node?

Well it's running an unmodified kernel... the database itself I guess
is just submitting direct-IO requests from multiple processes to
multiple disks. The objects should be pretty warm on the freeing CPU,
but yes it would take a cacheline transfer at some level I guess.
