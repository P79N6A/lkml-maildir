Previously, it was Slackware and now Debian, not "officially supported."
But I never had any problem with kernels 2.6.5-2.6.9 with either
distribution.

Yes, I am using the latest stable.

Questions:
1. Is the VMWare host Windows or Linux?
2. Is the distribution of Linux you are attempting to run as a guest one
that is supported by VMWare?
3. Are you using the latest version of VMWare?
VMWare is a commercial, licensed product. I have a license (Windows XP
Host), but I haven't done much with it recently, mostly because the
machine in question is now a *real* dual-boot and it doesn't really have
enough RAM to support a Linux guest in the manner to which Linux is
accustomed. :)
When I was using VMWare with Linux guests, however, my recollection is
that Red Hat Linux was supported; everything else was "roll your own". I
was able to get Debian "woody", Knoppix LiveCDs and hard disk installs
to work easily as guests. A little more hacking was required with
Gentoo, because of the different way Gentoo handles "/etc/init.d".
If I run out of more interesting things to do this weekend, I might
upgrade my VMWare to the latest stable and try to load Gentoo 2004.3 as
a guest with a 2.6 kernel, just to see what happens. I have Gentoo's
2.6.10-r3 running on all of my Linux boxes. I had one panic with
2.6.10-r1, but no events of any kind since that.
