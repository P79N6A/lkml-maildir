Hello.
I would like to have a common model to load microcodes (and in the new boot 
procedure), but I've lost the status of such project, I think things for 2.7.
Any news?
Is microcode_ctl still maintained? I've made some correction/extentions but now 
new from the maintainer.
Intel give us the new microcode? I had contact with the new contact/maintainer/? 
person in Intel, but still no new microcode since summer 2001. So maybe before 
changing the driver, could you check the Intel vision about Linux and microcode?
ciao
