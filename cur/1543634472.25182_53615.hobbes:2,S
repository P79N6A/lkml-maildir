You can theoretically run kernel in one task (I mean "task" in the 
Intel-processor-meaning of the word ;) ) and userspace programs in another 
task, which will result in having 4GB of memory for both of them, won't 
it?
I know, there would be big compilcations - for example copying data 
betweeen userspace and kernelspace should be problem, and if implemented, 
I can't imagine how to do it considerably fast...which is IMHO the main 
reason why it isn't done such way.
