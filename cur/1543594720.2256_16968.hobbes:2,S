Which clearly marks you as a typical kernel-side developer :-) It never
ceases to amaze me how different a userland perspective can be from that of
people who live in kernel space.
You could write 'how many kernel developers does it take to screw in a
lightbulb'-type jokes I suspect. Except that sometimes it isn't funny
Alan may be right in stating that nothing beats userspace state machines in
the same number of processes as there are cpus, from an efficiency
standpoint.
But that foregoes the point that the code is far more complex and harder to
make 'obviously correct', a concept that *does* translate well to userspace.
