Subject: Error while copying file on a new filesystem

Hi,
I am involved in development of a new file system. I can successfully
write/read on the filesystem partition. But when I copy or move a
file, I get this error:
[root@sumit /mnt/newfs]# mv /root/1 .
mv: writing `/mnt/newfs/1': No space left on device
And although I get this error, the file is successfully copied to the
directory and I can read the file properly after that.
Can somebody please explain why this is happening. 'df' shows that
there are free available inodes/disk space. I am using device
virtualization to provide a single mount point for multiple devices.
Please let me know if you may require any further investigation logs.
thanks in advance,
with best regards,
Sumit
