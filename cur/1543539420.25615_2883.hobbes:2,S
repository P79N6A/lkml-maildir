This is a very good point as well.  Following the ethernet
comparison a bit further... An FTP program should not be able to
generate raw TCP packets or ethernet frames at that low
level.  FTP sends data to the TCP layer, and should not be able
to send random bits to the raw interface using standard TCP level
services.  I think this is a good comparison of what something is
designed for and what it can be used for.  If an interface can be
misused, it should be fixed.
The fact that lower level interfaces could be used to acheive the
same result is completely irrelevant IMHO.

I agree completely.  In userland it is called "dummy proofing".

I agree with that also.  Too often people post something cut and
dried and get dogged for it.  I recall someone in the past
saying:  The easiest way of getting a patch to the linux kernel
refused, is to post it to linux-kernel for inclusion.
100% right on target.
