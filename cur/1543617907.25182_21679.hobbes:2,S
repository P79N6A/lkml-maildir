Hi,
in the tune2fs manual I found the ext2 option 'filetype'. A file type seems
to be an 8 bit number, defined in linux/dirent.h in struct dirent64.
However, I didn't find any further docs about it, and I don't know any
userspace tools to read/set it. Could anyone please point me to more info
(or explain if this feature has any use)?
Thanks,
hjb
