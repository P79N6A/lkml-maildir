Subject: [RFC][PATCH] Don't complete AIO file extension until i_size is updated
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Don't complete AIO file extension until i_size is updated
AIO O_DIRECT file extension has a bug where the IO is completed before i_size
is updated.  direct_io_worker() calls aio_complete() after performing the
extension but before we get back up into generic_file_direct_write() which
updates i_size.  Another thread in io_getevents() can catch the completion and
stat() the file before i_size is updated.
Previously the direct write path would always call aio_complete() and return
-EIOCBQUEUED.  This fixes the bug by returning the bytes written in the sync
aio case which lets the aio core call aio_complete() after i_size has been
written.  Now the only time -EIOCBQUEUED is returned and aio_complete() is
called is when bios are still in flight at the time direct_io_worker() returns.

This fixes the bug reported (with a test case!) in
  
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6831
light aio-stress runs work after the change but we all know that fs/direct-io.c
is incredibly fragile.  Can you guys review this?  Has anyone packaged the
tests at 
http://developer.osdl.org/daniel/AIO/
 in a way that can be used to
check for regressions?
