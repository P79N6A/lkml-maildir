This may be true for the keyboard mentioned earlier in this thread, but for
my keyboard (IBM RapidAccess) hardware support is required.  I got a CD with
my keyboard, with Windows (9x/NT) drivers on it, and rumour has it that if
you warm-boot into Linux from windows (with the drivers installed) the keys
generate scan-codes.  A hard reset obviously resets the keyboard-controller
(or something), and stops the scancode-generation.  I have not confirmed
this myself though, as I haven't got windows on this computer.
The keyboard sounds as if it's got the same keys as the "Internet Keyboard"
mentioned earlier, with CD-buttons, volume + mute, 4 "programmable" buttons
(ie changeable labels), help and sleep.  There are also two extra LEDs on
the keyboard, one connected to the mute button and the other to the sleep-
button.  The LEDs are not important at all (although I expect that if we
have to create hardware-support for it it shouldn't be too hard), but the
buttons would be nice...
I e-mailed IBM about half a year ago about the specs for the keyboard, but
never received a reply.  I guess it's worth another try...
Anyway, I've got Microsofts Windows DDK, and an option to borrow another
RapidAccess keyboard, and intend to find out how to initialise the keyboard
- however, if a solution already exists, there is no need for me to do that.
Any ideas?

Alas, that is not an option for me, until I get the keyboard to generate
these scan-codes.
