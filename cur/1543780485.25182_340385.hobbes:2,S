That would work for swsusp, but there are other users that want to
know if a struct page is valid ram (eg. ioremap), so in that case
swsusp would not be able to mess with the flag.
I do think swsusp should (and can, quite easily though I may have
missed something) consolidate PG_nosave and PG_nosave_free, however
that's out of the scope of this patch.
