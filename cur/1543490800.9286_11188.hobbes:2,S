I understand that the intercepting function lives in a module.
You should be very careful when you remove the module
(SMP makes it more difficult but its not trivial even on UP).
When you remove the modules it is possible that some processes
are still in an intercepted system call. These functions will
try to return to the intercepting "wrapper" which is now gone.
On UP you can inc/dec the module use count by the wrapper code.
That does not work for SMP.
If this is just for experiments and you can live with wasted
memory, I suggest that you retrieve the original syscall pointer
but never unload the module.
