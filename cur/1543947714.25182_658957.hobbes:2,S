Subject: defconfig's for all x86 subarchitectures

For compile tests it would be nice it we had at least for each 
subarchitecture not covered by X86_GENERICARCH a defconfig.
These are the following subarchitectures:
- X86_ELAN
- X86_VOYAGER
- X86_NUMAQ
- X86_VISWS
- X86_RDC321X
- X86_VSMP
A defconfig is nothing special, it's enough to simply put the .config 
used for one machine into arch/x86/configs/ .
Thanks in advance
Adrian
