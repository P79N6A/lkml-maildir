Well we do multiple-lines-per-printk in rather a lot of places and it has
two advantages:
- less text size (I expect)
- the printk is "atomic" in that the logically-connected output lines
  won't get tangled up with an intervening printk from another CPU, or from
  an interrupt handler on this CPU.
Those are pretty modest advantages and I guess we could live without them
if we got a significant gain from doing so.  But it'd take quite some
effort hunting down all the callsites, and preventing new ones from
occuring.
