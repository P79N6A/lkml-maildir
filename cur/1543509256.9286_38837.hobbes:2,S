Are you running with two processors or one?  The crashes we all seem to be
having only happen in SMP mode.  Without a 2nd CPU, everything works fine.
If you are using SMP, this is indeed promising.  My crashme script was
designed to crash it in a couple of seconds, but any amount of disk i/o
would crash the system... at least within hours.
