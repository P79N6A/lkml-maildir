Ok I just remembered that not only did I expect the cpu task to never be 
scheduled and it _might_ be scheduled on sched_init, it is actually 
_consciously_ scheduled on hotplug cpu which I have no way of handling at the 
moment. On both your configs I noticed you had hotplug cpu enabled, but 
perhaps it isn't really being used on the more conservative config. So this 
is something I already know I need to handle. Did your ppc that had 
the "bitmap error" have hotplug cpu enabled? It might be an unrelated 
bug^Wphenomenon.
