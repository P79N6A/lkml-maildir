indeed, thank you for giving it better wording.

If you let only one CPU at a time access the "xmit path" you solve all
the reordering. If you want to be more fine grained you make the
serialization point as low as possible in the stack - perhaps in the
driver.
But I think even what we have today with only one cpu entering the
dequeue/scheduler region, _for starters_, is not bad actually ;->  What
i am finding (and i can tell you i have been trying hard;->) is that a
sufficiently fast cpu doesnt sit in the dequeue area for "too long" (and
batching reduces the time spent further). Very quickly there are no more
packets for it to dequeue from the qdisc or the driver is stoped and it
has to get out of there. If you dont have any interupt tied to a
specific cpu then you can have many cpus enter and leave that region all
the time.
