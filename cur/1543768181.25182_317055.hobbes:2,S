Hi Dimitry,
No go with the patch, and even with patch and uncommenting the 
ps2_drain(). The alps touchpad is dead as a dodo.
Cheers
Mitch

Hi Mitch,
OK, here is an updated patch. Hopefully if we toggle passthrough mode on
Dualpoints we will get an absolute packet in response to POLL command.
Please give it a try. If it does not work please try uncommenting call to
ps2_drain in drivers/input/mouse/alps.c::alps_passthrough_mode().
Thanks!
