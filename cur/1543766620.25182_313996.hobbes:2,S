Unless you already did this in the latest release, it would be nice to
have something like havign all the low level tools be by default in some
~/lib/git or whatever, and only the cg-* scripts in ~/bin on install,
unless maybe you pass some kind of I_AM_A_REAL_GIT=1 on the make
line ...
I don't really plan to use the low level tools, and I don't like the way
they clobber my bin namespace :)
