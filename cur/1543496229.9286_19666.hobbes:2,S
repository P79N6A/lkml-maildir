The latest Unix uemacs I've seen is 3.10e, which is used quite extensively by
people UWA (everyone but me, it seems).  I've seen references to later versions
around (eg, in the pico source I seem to recall; pico is based on microemacs
3.10 but I think I saw references to bits from later versions in there).
Where do other people get uemacs from?  Did development die after the main
developer moved to only supporting the Amiga version, or is there a new
source site I haven't found yet?
David.
