That's fine (actually, it's more than that: it's great!).

The idea is to do something along these lines:
 o Use PCA DMA interface for managing all DMA buffers.
 o If sizeof(dma_addr_t) > 4, turn on DAC mode and call
   pci_set_dma_mask(dev, MAX_ADDR), where MAX_ADDR is the maximum
   address that can be reached by the controller (i.e.,
   0xffffffffffffffff for a truly 64-bit-capable PCI controller).
This way, everything should work out correctly and with good
performance on all imaginable platforms (ia64 with and without
hardware I/O TLB, plain x86, x86 with >4GB RAM, SPARC64 with 32-bit
dma_addr_t, etc.).
