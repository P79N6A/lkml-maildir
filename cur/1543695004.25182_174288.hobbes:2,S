I am indeed using the XT-PIC, but I was using it under 2.4.21 also, so I
doubt that is the cause of the problems, especially seeing as bartlomiej's
suggestion of increasing the read-ahead caching worked a treat.  
* Does anyone know why the values of the read-ahead caching are so different
between 2.4.x and 2.6.0-test7/8?  It seems to me that there are two
problems;
A) the meaning of the readahead value has changed (almost guaranteed, as in
2.4.21 I can't set anything above 255)
B) the default of 256 is low, as the default in 2.4 of 8 gave me 40Mb/sec
and the default of 256 in 2.6 gives me only 13Mb/s!
I couldn't see any reference to this change of behaviour anywhere on the
kernel mailing list archives.

I'll give it a go just in case, however I don't like building kernels with
SMP when I have no need for it.
