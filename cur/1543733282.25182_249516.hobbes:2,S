Yes, I saw it and commented on it.  Al didn't seem to like the set_fs
very much, so that specific implementation appears to be dead.

Sure, a 2GB copyfile(2) is nasty (sendfile can at least return a short
count), esp. with slow media like a usb1 attached hard drive.  Might
be a reasonable short-term solution to return -EFBIG whenever a user
tries to copy a file >$PRETTY_LARGE and doesn't have CAP_WHATNOT.
Would you accept such a solution?  And if you would, which magic
constants should I use?
