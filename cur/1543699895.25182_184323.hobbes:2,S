in your previous email you said the information is available via bkbits
web.  But in an older email you said if we would use the web to fetch
information you would shut it down (for whatever reason, not relevant
for this email). Please clarify this single point: is the "web" a tool
we can use to fetch information? If not (as you claimed months ago),
then the information exported in the web sure can't be classified as
information to use for interoperability as you stated a few emails ago
today.
I'm fine with the partial info in bkcvs, not sure why you say I'm not
happy or why you think my emotions matters at all with this thread.
