Suggest you chainsaw the whole lot and simply do a wakeup_bdflush(0) from
interrupt context.
The only functional change I can see with this is that it could cause pdflush
to get stuck if there are dead NFS/SMBFS/etc mounts.
But if that happens, we need to fix it anyway.  Those filesystems should
avoid getting stuck if called with writeback_control.sync_mode != WB_SYNC_ALL,
especially if current_is_pdflush() returns true.
