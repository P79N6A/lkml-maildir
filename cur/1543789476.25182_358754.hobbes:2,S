You have that node?  That's a good start :)
I think the "name" might have changed, it looks like I messed that up
somehow.  What does:
	 udevinfo -p /sys/class/input/input0/event0/ -a
show (or whatever that sysfs path is.)
Oops, heh, that dies on my box too.  Ok, I think that's the issue,
sorry.  I'm working on it...
