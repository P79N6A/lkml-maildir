The "original BSD license" listed on that page actually has 4 numbered
clauses, number 3 (the "advertising clause") being the conflicting one.
The "modified BSD license", which they link to on the same page, has 3
clauses and *is* GPL compatible.  As far as I can tell, the license we are
using at CITI is nearly word-for-word the "modified BSD license", and is
GPL compatible.
