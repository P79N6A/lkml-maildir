A second method was proposed as well - create a file with a hole in it,
map it, then dirty the pages in the hole and exit.  This would not
require suid.
This is basically a documentation issue, unless someone wants to go fix
it.  I wouldn't bother myself - it's ext[23] only and not really very
useful.
The basic problem is this: the documentation states "This is intended to
allow for the system to continue functioning even if non-priveleged
users fill up all the space available to them."  This states that it's a
security feature.  It does not work as intended - all users are
privileged to do this - so the documentation should be updated.
I'll send a patch to someone later today.
