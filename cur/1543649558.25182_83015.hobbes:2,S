well, in fact, cs4232 is backward compatible to cs4231.
the question is, whether cs4232 module works on PC9800, or not.
i guess the control-port is not used on this card.  in such a case,
you can deactivate the control-port via module option (or even add
ifdef for the specific kernel config).
if cs4232 doesn't work, we'll apply your patch to cs4231.

thanks.
please send me the new patch to me, too, so that i can merge it also
to ALSA tree.
