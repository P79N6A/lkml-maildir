Hello all,
  Here I have a "small" problem using EQL interfaces.
 I have this 2 linux boxes and 2 phone lines between, and I thought I'll
use eql so I can get a higher bandwidth, so I configured an eql interface
on each system that enslaved the 2 ppp links. Everything works fine
between the 2 computers I get a 6K/s rate ( each link is at 3.3K/s ) so I
can say I'm satisfaied with the speed. But now comes the problem: I want
to enable routing through this link, so I added the routes but it seems
like the forwarding doesn't work. First machine has kernel 2.0.35 second
one 2.0.36, they both act as routers for their own LAN, and the routing
works very fine through default routes. We got this link because we didn't
want our external link to get occupied by local traffic let's say.
Anyway first box is router for 193.230.255.0 and secondary for
193.230.187.0, on the eql interfaces I used 2 IPs from 193.230.187.0 and
that would be 156 and 157, and for internal ppps I used fake ips from
192.168.1.0. Here is the routing table from both computers and ifconfig
from both computers :

  so the problem is that nothing forwards through this link, a traceroute
gives timeout, and I repeat the link works fine .. a ftp between them
works at 6K/s. So my question would be : Is there any problem with eql
device? like you cannot route through it? or maybe there is some mistake I
made configuring it?
  Thank you in advance,
