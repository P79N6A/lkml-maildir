Sorry for the delay. Below is the copy of kermit startup file
that I use for talking to a device that does not echo back characters.
I also power-on/off the device while connecting kermit to it, and
I don't think I got kicked off. : so
set carrier-watch off (abbreviated below as set carrier off)
should get you going talking to a linux box via
serial line during booting. (However,
I believe you already captured the necessary log using
uucp suite of tools.)
  set line /dev/ttyS0
  set speed 38400
  set carrier off                    <-  This is key to the disconnect 
problem.
  set terminal echo local   <--- lines below here are for local echo back
  set terminal newline on
  set terminal cr-display crlf

You are very welcome.
 From a happy Kermit user.
If you need to ask elaborate ckermit questions,
comp.protocols.kermit.misc is where the original
developers of Kermit hang around.
Happy Hacking,
Ishikawa, Chiaki
