Yes it shows the performance gains from the quicklist approach. This the 
work Robin Holt did on the problem. The problem is how to validate the 
patch because there should be no change at all on ia64 and on i386 we 
basically measure the overhead of the slab allocations. One could 
measure the impact x86_64 because this introduces quicklists to that 
platform.
The earlier discussion focused on avoiding zeroing of pte as far as I can 
recall.

This was on i386? Could be hidden now by the slab use ther.
