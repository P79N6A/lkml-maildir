Oh f*ck, why do people do ugly code like this?
That's just about the nastiest thing I've ever seen.
If you want to go this way, do it with
	asmlinkage long sys_mkdirat(long __dfd, ..
	{
		int dfd = __dfd;
which is at least unconditional.
The thing is unconditionally doing the "skip upper bits" is _faster_ then 
the conditional test to see if you even need it.
Conditionalizing code like this is EVIL and STUPID.
However, what I suspect David was actually suggesting was to just have 
some trivial for just the compat functions. You can generate them 
automatically based on 
 - function name
 - signedness/unsignedness of each argument
with some preprocessor hackery.
So each architecture could have the following #defines:
	#define SARG(x) "sext " x "," x	 // Whatever the architecture asm is for sign-extending a register
	#define UARG(x)	"zext " x "," x
	#define JMP(x)	"jmp " x
	#define ARG1 "%r3"
	#define ARG2 "%r4"
	#define ARG3 "%r5"
	...
and then there would be a generic helper header:
	#define compat_fn1(n, x1) 		\
		asm("compat_" ## n ":\n\t"	\
			x1(ARG1) "\n\t"		\
			JMP(##n))
	#define compat_fn2(n, x1, x2) 		\
		asm("compat_" ## n ":\n\t"	\
			x1(ARG1) "\n\t"		\
			x2(ARG2) "\n\t"		\
			JMP(##n))
	#define compat_fn3(n, x1, x2) 		\
		asm("compat_" ## n ":\n\t"	\
			x1(ARG1) "\n\t"		\
			x2(ARG2) "\n\t"		\
			x3(ARG3) "\n\t"		\
			JMP(##n))
	... fn4..fn6 ..
	compat_fn4(sys_semctl, SARG, SARG, SARG, UARG);
	compat_fn6(sys_waitif, SARG, UARG, UARG, SARG, UARG);
	..
you get the idea - automatically generated stub assembly functions that 
zero-extend or sign-extend the arguments properly. Each architecture would 
need just a minimal set of "helper defines" to create the per-architecture 
assembly language.
(And no, I didn't test the above at all).
