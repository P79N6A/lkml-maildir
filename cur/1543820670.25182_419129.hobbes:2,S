I don't think it's totally unlikely. Could be streaming a large media
file to many clients, for instance. Of course you are not going to push
gigabytes of data per seconds like this test, but it's still the same
type of workload.

Yeah with mostly io then I'd be hard pressed to show a difference.

I didn't claim it was, just trying to show some data on at least one
case where the lockless patches perform well and the stock kernel does
not :-)
Are there cases where the lockless page cache performs worse than the
current one?

Ah clever, I didn't think of stopping on the first hole. Works well
since you need to manually get a reference on the page anyways.
Let me redo the numbers with this splice updated.
