Hello,
I try to boot my linux kernel (with 2.4 or 2.6 it's the same problem) on an
embeded board (EM04N MenMicro) base on a MPC8245 cpu...
When i boot i 've;
> Detected PPCBOOT header
>     Verifying image CRC...ok
>     Uncompressing Multi-File Image ... ok
>     Moving initrd...ok
>     Passing Kernel parameters: root=ramfs console=ttyS0,9600
>     Starting Linux Kernel.
>
and stop here... i must hard reset the board...
Anyone boot a linux kernel on this board ?
I heard about UART serial port problem with MPC8245 cpu, but i don't find a
working solution for patching kernel or setting up correctly...
Anyone can help me ?
I use :
ELDK kit cross compilation for PPC8245
uBoot
and official last kernel source...
Thanks
