Hi
I'm having some trouble finding a kernel which will successfully boot on my
computer. It seems to be having trouble during the boot process finding the
IDE devices, parts of my dmesg are below
PCI_IDE: unknown IDE controller on PCI bus 00 device f9, VID=8086, DID=244b
PCI_IDE: not 100% native mode: will prove irqs later
ide0: BM-DMA at 0xf000-0xf007, BIOS settings: hda:DMA, hdb:DMA
ide1: BM-DMA at 0xf00f, BIOS settings: hdc:DMA, hdd:DMA
hdc: IRQ probe failed (0)
hdc: IRQ probe failed (0)
hdc: CD-ROM 36x/AKU, ATAPI CDROM drive
hdc: IRQ probe failed (0)
hdd: IRQ probe failed (0)
hdd: IRQ probe failed (0)
hdd: 8X4X32, ATAPI CDROM drive
hdd: IRQ probe failed (0)
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
hdc: lost interrupt
hdc: lost interrupt
hdc: lost interrupt
hdc: ATAPI 36X CD-ROM drive, 128kb Cache
Uniform CD-ROM driver Revision: 3.11
hdd: lost interrupt
hdd: lost interrupt
hdd: lost interrupt
Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
floppy0: no floppy controllers found
(after ethernet device is detected)
hda: 8223MB, CHS=16708/16/63
hdb: 29180MB, CHS=3720/255/63
Partition check:
 hda:hda: timeout
 hda: timeout (10 times)
And, earlier in the dmesg I get a keyboard error:
keyboard: Timeout - AT keyboard not present?
My system is a P4, motherboard is the Gigabyte GA-8IDML-C (Intel 845
AGPset), 256M pc133 ram. Both of my hard drives are seagate. I use debian,
the 2.2.19-pre17-idepci rescue kernel works boots fine (no IDE or keyboard
problems), I also tried 2.2.20 which produced the same errors as 2.2.21-rc3.
What is going on?
Geoff
