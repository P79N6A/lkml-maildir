Yes, toggling dirty_highmem "just fixes it" in all our tests.  I hadn't
tested it on the production machine yet - but I'm just installing it
there now since it's been running fine on a less important machine for
a few days now.
I did wonder about allowing the dirty percentage to go way up, but that
would have cause "this one goes up to 110%" comments in the sysctl
limits code and people would have thought I was childish.  Can't have
that.  Much better to have "int one = 1" instead.
