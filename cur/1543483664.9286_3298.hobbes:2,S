I've been having a lot of problems with two K6-350's. If I run
one at full speed it segfaults very regularly during compiles,
and under load (like X with Netscape). I bumped it down to 333Mhz
and it seems to be more stable. I have tried two different
processors, different motherboards, different memory, and all
combinations of bios/bus setups. My machine at home is better,
but still a bit flaky. This has been with 2.0.36 and 2.1-2.2
kernels.
One thing, all these are using FIC VA-503+ motherboards, with VIA
chipsets. I am really starting to wonder if Linux has a problem
with these chipsets at high speeds and AMD processors. I haven't
had any problem under Win95 (ack!) on the same machines. Also, I
have seen a bunch of similar postings like this....
