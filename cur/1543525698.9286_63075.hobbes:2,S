Your patch is better than mine. The card can now recover from when an
interrupt doesn't get delivered, and when the Tx queue fills.
Still, the card will choke on a FTP transfer, while ping -f works just
fine (with small packets).  This is if I run it on IRQ7.
On IRQ9, the machine will lock up immediately after the ifup (which 
involves a DHCP query which does succeed however). Using sysrq I can
see that the EIP loops around <c3012e8a>, an address in the 3c575 driver
(it's the only module loaded).  I can't see where in the code that
address would be though, using ksyms gets me nowhere (the address refers
to a point near a data structure, not to anywhere near real code).
IRQ9 usually works, but gives me the ``suprious interrupt on IRQ7'' error.
IRQ7 with the new driver works the best, but still far from perfect.
Is this a good indication that I should go see my vendor and eventually
beat him up with the notebook, or could the spurious interrupt on IRQ7 be
a kernel issue ?   It does happen both on 2.2 and 2.3 though...
As a side note, the card doesn't come up on boot as it does in 2.2.X.
I have to plug it out and re-insert it, then ifup it.  But I guess that's
Yenta related and not a 3c575_cb.c issue.
Thanks,
