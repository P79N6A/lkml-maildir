  Now this would not happen as j_wbufsize is larger than 1. But still
even if it would happen ll_rw_block() would be called, that would clear
a dirty bit and and the next time we see the buffer we take a different
route.
  But actually you are right that if we fail with
bufs==journal->j_wbufsize we would go into the next iteration of the
loop and queue the buffer again. Anyway we agreed to rewrite this code
in another thread :). I just have to make sure we don't have a similar
problem in the new version.
