Hi!
I was able to get toshiba-FIR working in 2.5.X with rather nasty hacks
--  like setting max speed to 9600 and disabling self tests. Now it
kind-of works..... slowly.
[It failed self-test. So I disabled it. Then it tried to communicate
with t68i phone at 1Mbit  . Ouch. I tried to limit it at 115k but that
did not do the trick, so I limited it to 9600. That helped.]
