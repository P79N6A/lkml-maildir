The first thing I noticed when reading sata_sil.c was readl() and
writel() calls.  Thinking that meant "read/write line" I guessed it
could invoke a sectors = 15 hardware issue with some data, and went to
see exactly what it means.
I haven't determined which include/asm-*/io.h is used for
MCYRIXIII/MVIAC3, but my best guess is include/asm-i386/io.h
#define readl(addr) (*(volatile unsigned int *) (addr))
#define writel(b,addr) (*(volatile unsigned int *) (addr) = (b))
then I find volatile in a driver example from
http://publications.gbdirect.co.uk/c_book/chapter8/const_and_volatile.html
Which describes how volatile is used to peek hardware status.
but, in sata_sil.c, sil_scr_write does
                writel(val, mmio);
volatile is used for data, not status! I can't glean this construct
(when the data runs out it's null and the loop ends?). Was going to say
if hardware caused status to turn up null that could be checked and
assigned before being used...

So sata_sil.c is using the wrong construct or am I not reading it right?

Might it come from reiserfs? I didn't mkfs again after the last sata 
device block(s). I'll be doing some more experimentation, how would I
'find' the null in proc? can I detect that in user space?
