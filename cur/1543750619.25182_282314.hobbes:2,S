Not exactly - Synaptics X driver "grabs" the device it uses so other
processes do not get any data from the touchpad when its active. When
keyboard and mouse initialization got swapped around many people who
were specifying /dev/input/event0 as a device were in for surprise as
the driver "grabbed" keyboard making it impossible to type.

Does the keyboard work when you are not in X (like when booting to
runlevel 3)? It looks like everything is detected correctly...
