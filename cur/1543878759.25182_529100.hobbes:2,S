I don't think it has ever been demonstrated that keventd latency is
excessive, or a problem.  I guess we could instrument it and fix stuff
easily enough.
The main problem with keventd has been flush_scheduled_work() deadlocks: the
caller of flush_scheduled_work() wants to flush work item A, but holds some
lock which is also needed by unrelated work item B.  Most of the time, it
works.  But if item B happens to be queued the flush_scheduled_work() will
deadlock.
The fix is to flush-and-cancel just item A: if it's not running yet, cancel
it.  If it is running, wait until it has finished.  Oleg's
	void cancel_work_sync(struct work_struct *work)
is queued for 2.6.22 and should permit some kthread->keventd conversions
which would previously been deadlocky.
The thing to concentrate on here is the per-cpu threads, which is where the
proliferation appears to be coming from.  Conversions to
schedule_work()+cancel_work_sync() and conversions to
create_singlethread_workqueue().
