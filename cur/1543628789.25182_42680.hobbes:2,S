Hi,
BIOS-provided physical RAM map:
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000000000 - 00000000000a0000 (usable)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000000f0000 - 0000000000100000 (reserved)
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000100000 - 0000000017ffc000 (usable)
 BIOS-e820: 0000000017ffc000 - 0000000017fff000 (ACPI data)
 BIOS-e820: 0000000017fff000 - 0000000018000000 (ACPI NVS)
 BIOS-e820: 00000000ffff0000 - 0000000100000000 (reserved)
hm, page 17ffc000 reserved twice.
Erm, can this be any bad? I mean, Linux seems to work very well on that 
PC, but Windows 2000 couldn't even boot the install. Could this be the 
reason? Is there further nastiness to expect?
Regards,
Thunder
