Interesting.  Better written as
	rpcc	%1
1:	rpcc	%0
	subl	%0,%1,%0
	cmpult	%0,%2,%0
	bne	%0,1b
	: "=&r" (tmp), "=&r" (cc) : "r"((int)loops));
Or with the (int) moved back to the __delay prototype.
With both arguments to cmpult properly sign extended
we get proper results without the extra zap instruction.
