- The experience from vserver, planetlab and OpenVZ is that it is good
  to be able to monitor processes in other namespaces.  
- The linux experience says filesystems are a good way to do that.
- So we really want to filesystem monitoring interfaces to depend on
  the filesystem mount options instead of current.
- Starting with making /proc and sysctls depend on current is a cheap
  way to get things up and going.
- When I consider breaking things up into multiple filesystems I run
  across the occasional file that depends on multiple namespaces.
  uids in /proc/sysvipc/* for example.  Luckily I have yet to find
  any directory structures that depend on more then one namespace.
  Maybe that can be handled properly by capturing multiple 
  namespaces at mount time but I am a bit leery of that.
- The visibility of namespaces should be match the visibility of the
  processes that use them.   Access control of course can be more
  restricted.
- We want to see how namespaces connect to tasks.
Therefore.
/proc/net, /proc/sys, /proc/sysvipc, and probably a few others
should migrate under /proc/<pid>/task/<tid> (not under /proc/<pid>
so we can finally straighten out the task group vs task issue).
Todays problem of course is /proc/net/
What I had intended to implement was:
/proc/current -> /proc/<pid>/task/<tid>
(A new symlink to the task directory)
/proc/net -> /proc/current/net
(like /proc/mounts)
The only downside of placing files under the task directory is
that we use a lot more dentries for /proc.
....
Optimizations.
If the dentry pressure is significant and we don't have data from
other namespaces in the files causing us to want to present the
information differently for different processes I support using
an id and a per namespace upper level directory.  With a symlink
into there from the task directories.
/proc/<pid>/task/<tid>/net -> ../../.../netns/<netns id>
The id I would use is a struct pid because that makes the id useful
for userspace monitoring and control applications and because we
can migrate it.
In my view /proc/netns/<pids> would be implemented like
/proc/<pids> with readdir and lookup returning different contents
based upon the pid namespace captured when we mounted proc.
Further struct pid would be enhanced so that as long as we have
a namespace using a struct pid as an id we would not free that pid_nr
in any of the pid namespaces.  Just like we do with process groups
and sessions today.
I think for the network namespace and network /proc files that
optimization is safe.  I seem to recall checking and not finding any
ids from other namespaces in the files under /proc/net.
I will try for some more detailed replies.
