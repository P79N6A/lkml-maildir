Indeed however I didn't mean the X server xscreensaver and family - I 
meant the BIOS DPMS, kernel console saver, etc functionality.  I had this 
kind of problem with my stationary computer (it locked solid when the 
screen was blanked) with some older kernel version (around 2.4.9).  I 
think kernel screen saveing can be turned off with some sort of escape 
code...
indeed:
$ man console_codes
  /timeout
gives:
  ESC [ 9 ; n ] where n is screen blank timeout in minutes
  ESC [ 13 ] to unblank
  ESC [ 14 ; n ] to set the VESA powerdown interval in minutes
so try something like
  echo -e "\e[13]\e[9;10080]\e[14;10080]"
to make it blank after a week and see if it still locks.
You can also try turning of VESA/DPMS blanking in the Bios.
Cheers,
MaZe.
