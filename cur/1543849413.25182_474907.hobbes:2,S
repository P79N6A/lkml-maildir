Greetings;
I just arrived home a few hours ago, and my wife said the outside lights 
hadn't worked for the last 2 days.
I come in to check, the this machine, which runs some heyu scripts to do 
this, was powered down.  So I powered it back up and it had to e2fsk 
everything.  I have a ups with a fresh battery which passes the tests just 
fine.
The only thing in the logs is a single line about eth0 being down:
Oct 17 05:31:11 coyote kernel: eth0: link down.
Oct 19 20:37:49 coyote syslogd 1.4.1: restart.
Uptime when this occurred was about 9 days.  Was this a known problem?

Cheers, Gene
