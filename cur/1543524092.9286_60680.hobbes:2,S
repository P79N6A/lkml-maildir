While sitting in X downloading an ISO of Slackware and listening to MP3s,
CPU usage on both of my processors spiked to 100% and stayed there.
Curious, I poked around with top and dmesg and found:
  1:51pm  up 20:00,  9 users,  load average: 2.52, 1.17, 0.56

and then dmesg was spewing:
kmalloc: Size (33554432) too large
kmalloc: Size (33554432) too large
kmalloc: Size (33554432) too large
kmalloc: Size (33554432) too large
kmalloc: Size (33554432) too large
kmalloc: Size (33554432) too large
kmalloc: Size (33554432) too large
--- snip ---
over and over and over and over and over and over.
It killed my PPP connection (I'm writing this off-line).  Surprisingly
everything is still functioning normally.  System rundown:
2.3.41, binutils 2.9.5.0.22, X 3.3.6 SVGA
Abit BP6 w/ 2 x Celeron 400 (not overclocked)
2940UW, Quantum 3.2GB, Quantum 6.4GB, Toshiba 12X, Conner 3GB tape
WinTV stereo card, AWE64, Sportster v.90
I guess I'll reboot now and see if that doesn't fix it.
