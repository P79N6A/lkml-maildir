Sweden has a quite unique law called the "Legal right to access private
land"-bill (allemansrätten), which constitutes that every person has the
right to walk in private fields/forests, swim in private lakes, what not.
You're allowed to pick fruits/berries/mushrooms in the forest camp
wherever you like as long as you do not destroy anything, etc. This law is
only restricted by means of what can be counted as the surroundings to a
house; that is, you are not allowed to put up a tent on someone's lawn.
This is one of the most appreciated laws in Sweden. Sure, it's easy to
abuse, but it seldom gets abused, out of fear that we might not get to
keep it.
