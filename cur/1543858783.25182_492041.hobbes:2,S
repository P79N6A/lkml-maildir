A bit more verbose response:
	I posted a notifier chain implementation back in June that bears some
resemblance to your suggestion -- a structure needed to be registered at
runtime. There was a single global list of them to iterate over for each
event.
	This patch and the following patches are significantly shorter than
their counterparts in that series. They avoid iterating over elements
with empty ops. The way function pointers and function bodies are
grouped together by this series should improve locality. The fact that
there's no locking required also makes it simpler to analyze and use.
	The patches to allow modules to register task watchers does make things
more complex though -- that does require a list and a lock. However, the
lock does not need to be taken in the fork/exec/etc paths if we pin the
module. In contrast your suggested approach is simpler because it
doesn't treat modules any differently. However overall I think the
balance still favors these patches.
