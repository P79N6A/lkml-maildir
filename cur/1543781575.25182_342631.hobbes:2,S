    I need some help with PCI hotplug for allowing a new driver at
Video4Linux.
    I'm trying to develop a kernel module to handle audio support for a
video chipset (cx2388x from conexant). This chipset does provide several
PCI ID according with its function:
14f1:8800 function 0: for video stuff
14f1:8801 or 14f1:8811 - function 1: for audio stuff
14f1:8802 - function 2: mpeg
14f1:8803 - function 3: VESA VIP
14f1:8804 - function 4: Host
    8800 is enabled in all cards, but the other PCI IDs only if the
board has an eeprom inside, and, at the first byte, bits 0 to 4 enables
each function. Functions 2 to 4 does require additional hardware, but
function 1 doesn't seem to require, since it will only enable DMA audio
transfers from board to memory the same way as function 0 does for
video. The board I have to test it doesn't have an eeprom, so, only
function 0 is enabled at boot. There's a way to enable other modes via
changing an internal register at cx88.
    At current kernel, module cx8800 does implement function 0; module
cx8801 is intended to implement function 1, but it is only a skeleton. I
have a modified version of cx8800 that enables function 1. After
enabling it, and with the help of fakephp, i got it recognized, but
without memory resources.
    I need memory to set its internal registers. Is there a way to make
PCI drivers to allocate a memory region for the board?
Thanks in advance,
Mauro
