Ben had lightweight sg structures called `kvecs' and `kveclets'. And
library functions to map pages into them.  And code to attach them
to BIOs.  So we'll be looking at getting that happening.
The other common requirement (used in several places in the kernel,
and in LVM2) is the ability to perform bulk I/O against a blockdev - simply
read and write a chunk of disk into a list of kernel pages.  So we'll need a
library function for that.   And the O_DIRECT/raw implementation can be bent
around to use those things.

Haven't thought about large pages.  We don't seem to have an implementation of
them yet, and I'm not sure how the DMA mapping API would get along with
them.
