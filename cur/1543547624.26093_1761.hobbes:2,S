Hi,
I would have liked to install RH 6.2 on the Athlon (700MHz) computer.
The installation from local CD was very easy, however, after reboot
I received some error messages. My questions are:
1. What exctly does a "Disabling CPUID Serial Number ... general protection
   fault: 000" mean?
2. What do I do about "Kernel panic - Attempted to kill the iddles task"
   and "In swapper task - not syncing"
3. How can I repair these problems?
 	Thanks,           Imrich
 P.s. If I boot from floppy, I get the same error messages.
