Subject: [PATCH 0/9] Cleanup mm/slab.c v2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Second take at cleaning up mm/slab.c.  Patch series has picked up 2 new
patches and dropped one old one.  The 2 new patches create new helper
functions, and I've dropped the patch to inline 3 functions after it was
deemed unecessary.
Appologies for the delay in getting version 2 out.  /me is easily
distracted by shiny things.
