Assuming that any hardware support that gets added will be there forever 
in some form of another is incredibly naive in my oppinion. And this goes 
for any operating system, not just Linux - hardware support has been 
dropped from several different operating systems over the years for lots 
of different reasons - I have boxes where I can't run the latest version 
of AIX any more since the hardware is no longer supported, but you don't 
see me ripping IBM's head off for that reason.

As I understand it the hook should never have been added in the first 
place. Doesn't matter if it has been there for a day, a week, a year or 10 
years - it should never have been added and once it was discovered it was 
removed - I have no trouble with that bit, especially since the pieces 
are still out there and you are free to just patch your personal kernel in 
any way you please to get the result you desire, or you can just stick 
with an older kernel until a suitable alternative shows up.

And why is it you expect open source developers to assist in supporting 
binary only drivers?
Binary only drivers undermine open source. If you want to depend on closed 
drivers go ahead, but if that support disappears then take it up with the 
company unwilling to provide open drivers or open specs so people can 
write their own open drivers.
You purchased a piece of hardware that depended on a closed source driver, 
no open source developer has any resonable commitment to support that.
If you want to be constructive instead of just bitch and moan, then go 
talk to Philips and get them to release code or specs so we can get proper 
open source drivers - your real beef is with them, not with open source 
developers.
