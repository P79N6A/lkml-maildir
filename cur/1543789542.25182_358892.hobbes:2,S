That's not much of a problem for me.  What I'm contemplating is a FUSE
file system driver that gets started in the initrd, and a kernel that
has a file system driver built-in for something stupid like cramfs or MINIX.
The idea is that (as proof of concept) it should be possible to supply
something like ext3 as a FUSE driver, and boot off it as the rootfs
without building ext3 into the kernel or ever modprobing it.  Besides
just being damn cool, and a show of quasi-hybrid microkernelism at work
(uh oh now Linus is going to remove FUSE from mainline :), it'd allow
some real visible macro-benchmarking of FUSE.

    Creative brains are a valuable, limited resource. They shouldn't be
