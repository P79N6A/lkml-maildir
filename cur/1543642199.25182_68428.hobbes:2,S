My new redmond linux amethyst edition cannot read the contents of the windows and program files folders, there are no errors on the fat 32 partition with 16 KBsectors, the partition is just over 14 gig and is primary, so is the other ext3 partition, i use os selector, and have noidea why they appear empty, other folders have their contents visible, im using kernel 2.4.12 with kde 2.2.2 . Thanks for any help you can offer.
