Unfortunately for me, I'm stuck with a (*choke*) AMI WinBios - I haven't
got such a setting. :/
(Also, if I set power management to be either APM or ACPI, the kernel 
doesn't "Power down" like it says it's going to.  Am I missing
something? (Probably!))
I don't mean to come across as such a newbie w.r.t. the memory detection,
lockups, or power management, but the sad facts are that I'm a software
guy, not a hardware guy, and most of this is new territory for me anyway.
