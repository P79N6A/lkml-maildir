You are using an outdated libc... (libc5 ?)
<sys/shm.h> should not include <linux/shm.h>...
You have the choice: you can use old kernel headers with an old libc
and new kernel headers with a new libc, but you can't mix them...
If for some reason you want to stay with linux 2.3, use the latest
stable libc (2.1.3 now)
