  Hi, all. I've just released version 1.3.0 of my devfsd (devfs
daemon) at: 
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/
This work has been sponsored by SGI.
This works with devfs-patch-v130 and devfs-patch-v99.7 (or later).
WARNING: THE CONFIG FILE FORMAT HAS CHANGED! The new format is more
intuitive. Make sure you edit your /etc/devfsd.conf file!!
The main changes are:
- Swap pathname and action fields in config file.
				Regards,
					Richard....
