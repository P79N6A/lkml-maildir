Here is a patch to upgrade to the latest version of the AMI MegaRAID driver
(0.93).  There isn't anything all that important in it that's new; mostly
little fixes and rearrangement.  I am planning on releasing a final version
1.00 within the next few weeks as soon as any little bugs that crop up in
0.93 are fixed.  I'd appreciate any testers out there who want to try it and
give feedback.  This patch is done against the 2.2.0-pre9 kernel, may not
work with a 2.0 kernel.  I'll post a patch for that tomorrow.
