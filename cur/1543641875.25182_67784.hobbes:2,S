It would be interesting to see whether this appears again without the
VMware module loaded before.

It might be:
1. a hardware problem
2. a bug in a non-free module
3. a bug in the kernel a non-free module suffers from
4. a bug in the kernel that is not related to non-free modules
If your problem is 1. or 4. there are people who can help you, in the case
of 2. or 3. it's impossible for everyone except the vendor of these moduls
to help you if these are binary-only modules (even in the case 3. where
it's a kernel bug because it's impossible to debug it).
