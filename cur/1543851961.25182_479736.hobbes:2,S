No, the polling seemed like the big race.

No, haven't tried that (first I've heard of it, thanks!)
As I said, I have had both keyboard and touchpad problems on this
laptop (formerly more of the former, lately more of the latter);
interestingly, after applying this patch I have had failures much less
frequently (multiple instances of several days w/out failure w/ the
laptop powered on continuously). Also interestingly, and
unfortunately, that may be coincidence; I've discovered a use case
that seems to reliably cause the touchpad to freeze up w/ or w/out the
patch applied (selecting multiple items in modified file list in
EasyTAG). Haven't looked into it yet, on the "hurts when I do this,"
"then don't do that" theory, but when I have time to look at the
EasyTAG code and try to reason about what's happening, I will.

Correct. Even rebooting doesn't help. Halt. Start.

Hmmmm.
