The current consensus (to the extent that one exists) seems to be that
platform device drivers belong in drivers[/platform]/x86, instead of in
arch/x86.  drivers/platform doesn't exist in the current -linus tree,
but Len Brown has patches to do it which should be pushed upstream in
this merge window.  In the meantime, use the old name drivers/misc (a
misnomer today, but won't be for much longer.)
