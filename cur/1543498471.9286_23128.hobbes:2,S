Only thing that I'm missing in your nice patch is a way to access the performance
counters of remote processes (so that I could hack gdb to do non intrusive
profiling a la itune). Extending the ioctls could work, although a ptrace
extension would be nicer.

Most likely not worth it for the small amount of data.
