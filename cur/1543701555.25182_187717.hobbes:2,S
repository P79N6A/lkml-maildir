  I just installed 2.4.23-bk9 on a system with a ethernet card that
lscpi reports as DC21142 which is a quad port card.  When the machine
came up it auto negotiated half duplex instead of full.  On 2.4.21-ac4
it negotiated Full.
  I searched around the bugzilla and couldn't find anything relevant but
it could just be my searching sucks.
  Any ideas?  I don't believe that passing an append parameter would be
good as it would have to be done to about 50 servers.
