Thank you for you answer ... I think my interrupt are not working ... I have
added a printk line in my interrupt routine, it is called every 1000 jiffies
!!!! if I do a cat /proc/interrupts ... once completed (c: I see that I dont
receive any interrupt on IRQ 4 ... it is alwais 0 ... but the serial is
registered.
thank again !

If you can see it, but it's not there, it's virtual. 
If you can't see it, but it is there, it's hidden. 
It you can't see it and it isn't there, it's gone.
