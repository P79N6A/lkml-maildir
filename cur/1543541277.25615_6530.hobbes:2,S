They say hindsight is 20/20.  The version numbering should have jumped
patchlevels to denote a milestone, but stayed within 2.3.x.  I would
have rather seen this:
2.3.99-pre1	=>	2.3.100
2.3.99-pre2	=>	2.3.101
...			...
2.3.99-pre9	=>	2.3.108
2.4.0-test1	=>	2.3.150
...			...
2.4.0-test6	=>	2.3.155
The patches could be still have been named as the are now, but every
full kernel release (when a whole tarball is released) whould have a
unique LINUX_VERSION_CODE.  All of 2.3.99-preX (9 kernels representing
2.5 months of development) was 0x020363, and all of 2.4.0-testX (6
kernels and another 2 months so far) is 0x020400.  We're stuck with
0x020400 until 2.4.1 is released.  It's too late to fix it now for
2.3/2.4, but hopefully for the end of 2.5 we can convince Linus to use a
saner version scheme.
