I have just gotten access (through the place I work, which will have to
remain 'nonymous) to a fully-loaded Compaq 8500 with 8 Xeon 550Mhz
processors (yep, eight of em) with 1MB of cache each and 4GB of RAM
along with the usual Big Compaq Server goodies like the latest Compaq
SMART RAID controller and some flavor of dual-100Mbps Ethernet/Gigabit
fibre network adapter type thing.
The exciting thing (for me anyway) is that it is currently running
RedHat 6.1, although with caveats: we haven't gotten it to use more than
the first 2GB of RAM yet and the NIC is pretty finicky at 100Mbps and we
haven't gotten the fibre channel working yet either.  It does, however
use all 8 processors without a problem, which lets it compile the kernel
in like 35 seconds. I'm going to try to get the latest 2.3 kernel
running on it tomorrow.  
If there are kernel development things that will really take advantage
of a monster machine like this for testing, please don't hesitate to let
me know.  Of course, I can't give anyone access to the machine directly,
but I am more than willing to run experiemental stuff on it. (Within
limits, of course.)  It's also in a lab environment so we have many
client machines on a switched network we can use to pound on it for load
testing situations.
