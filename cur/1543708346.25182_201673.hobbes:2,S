I'm not seeing it, with:
procps    both 3.1.8 and procps 3.2.0+
kernel    2.6.0-test11
library   glibc 2.3
hardware  uniprocessor G4 Mac
ntp       none (and you can tell by my email!)
Run "ps --info" to gather much of this data.
Note that time is a very awkward thing. You boot up,
with some incorrect clock. Then you adjust the time.
Later, you may discover that your clock has been
running too slow. So you adjust the frequency, but
what about the time that has already passed? Should
you change the boot time to represent what is now
known about your clock? What if, by doing so, you
cause some processes to have started before boot?
Then again, perhaps due to temperature change, you
discover that your clock frequency is wrong... This
is without even getting into the concept of leap
seconds, which are determined a few months in advance.
Two guesses:
1. leap seconds
2. SMP, with cycle counters out of sync
