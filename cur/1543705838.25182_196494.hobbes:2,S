Subject: [patch] 2.4 HiSax I-Talk/I-Surf doesn't work together with kernel isapnp
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

In 2.4, the HiSax I-Talk/I-Surf driver can only be initialized
successfully if the card has been activated using the isapnp userspace
tools. Automatic configuration using the isa-pnp module in the kernel
fails with messages such as:
Feb  4 00:28:19 paranoia kernel: ISurfPnP:some resources are missing 5/100/0
Feb  4 00:28:19 paranoia kernel: HiSax: Card Siemens I-Surf not installed !
There are two reasons for this failure:
(1) The isapnp code correctly builds the data structures, but the code
    in isurf.c looks in the wrong place for the mem parameter.
(2) The IO memory upper limit address is not set by isapnp code. I'm
    unsure whether this is a bug in isapnp.c or a hardware bug. I
    assumed the latter and did the fix in the I-Surf initialization
    routine.
The attached patch fixes the two issues. Please apply it to the 2.4
tree. I have successfully tested it on the two of my systems that have
an I-Surf.
Greetings,
