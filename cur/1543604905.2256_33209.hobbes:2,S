Hi Stelian,
Your sonypi driver claims the ownership of 2 Intel ACPI bridges and 1 ISA 
bridge.
All 3 are used in standard Intel chipsets, not just in Sony VAIOs.
Please do not use them, it confuses the hell out of the autoprobing and
automatic PCI driver registration.
I suggest checking up if this device has PnPBIOS entries and using them,
or using a different method of autoprobing.
Ciao, Marcus
