The description is wrong - this does not disable hyperthreading it merely
leaves one thread idle. I don't believe Intel have ever published a
procedure for truely disabling HT, but if you idle a thread you may want
to adjust the cache settings on a PIV (10.5.6 in the intel docs) and set
it to shared mode. Need to play more with what the bios does I guess.
So Ack but with the proviso it should say "Ignoring" or "Not using" not
"Disabling", because it does not do the latter and there seem to be
performance differences as a result
