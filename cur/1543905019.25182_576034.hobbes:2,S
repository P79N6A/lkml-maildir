Not at all.  I clearly misread your tone.

There are four possibilities that are immediately obvious to me:
a) The remaining difference is due mostly to the algorithmic complexity 
of the rbtree algorithm in CFS.
If this is the case, we should be able to vary the test parameters (CPU 
count, thread count, etc.) graph the results, and see a roughly 
logarithmic divergence between the schedulers as some parameter(s) vary. 
  If this is the problem, we may be able to fix it with data structure 
tweaks or optimized base cases, like how quicksort can be optimized by 
using insertion sort below a certain threshold.
b) The remaining difference is due mostly to how the scheduler handles 
volanomark.
vmstat can give us a comparison of context switches between O(1), CFS, 
and CFS+patch.  If the decrease in throughput correlates with an 
increase in context switches, we may be able to induce more O(1)-like 
behavior by charging tasks for context switch overhead.
c) The remaining difference is due mostly to how the scheduler handles 
something other than volanomark.
If context switch count is not the problem, context switch pattern still 
could be.  I doubt we'd see a 40% difference due to cache misses, but 
it's possible.  Fortunately, oprofile can sample based on cache misses, 
so we can debug this too.
d) The remaining difference is due mostly to some implementation detail 
in CFS.
It's possible there's some constant-factor overhead in CFS that is 
magnified heavily by the context switching volanomark deliberately 
induces.  If this is the case, oprofile sampling on clock cycles should 
catch it.

	Since you're already set up to do this benchmarking, would you mind 
varying the parameters a bit and collecting vmstat data?  If you want to 
run oprofile too, that wouldn't hurt.

If I'm missing both, I'm pretty screwed, but if either one is 
functional, I can send something out.

I'm more concerned about embedded systems.  These are the same people 
who want userspace character drivers to control their custom hardware. 
Having the robot point to where it hurts is a lot more convenient than 
hooking up a JTAG debugger.

Sure, but it's the non-subtle bugs that worry me.  These are usually 
related to low-level hardware setup, so they could miss the mainstream 
developers and clobber unsuspecting embedded developers.
I acknowledge that debugging such problems shouldn't be terribly hard on 
mainstream systems, but some people are going to want to choose a single 
scheduler at build time and avoid the hassle.  If we can improve CFS to 
be regression-free, and I think we can if we give ourselves a few 
percent tolerance and keep tracking down the corner cases, the pluggable 
scheduler infrastructure will just be another disused feature.
