Let me make it clearer to you,
lets say I call rs_open() on /dev/ttyS0 and if it
fails then I should not call rs_close() after a failed
rs_open().
I hope this is clear now.

Lets see what happens with your approach
1. I call rs_open(), it fails, ref_count set to 1
2. I am sane enough not to call rs_close() on the
device which failed to open with rs_open the first
time, count is set to 1, driver never unloads.
I do not have access to block_til_ready currently.
But, I will see that function and revert with more
comments.
