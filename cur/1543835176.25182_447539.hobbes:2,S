Subject: [PATCH] knfsd: Fix stale file handle problem with subtree_checking.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The following patch fixes a bug that was introduced since 2.6.17,
and should go in 2.6.18.
### Comments for Changeset
A recent patch:
  h=7fc90ec93a5eb71f4b08403baf5ba7176b3ec6b1
moved the call to nfsd_setuser out of the 'find a dentry for a
filehandle' branch of fh_verify so that it would always be called.
This had the unfortunately side-effect of moving *after* the call
to decode_fh, so the prober fsuid was not set when nfsd_acceptable
was called, the 'permission' check did the wrong thing.
This patch moves the nfsd_setuser call back where it was, and add as
call in the other branch of the if.
