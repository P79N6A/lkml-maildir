In the FWIW category, I booted 50-23 about an hour & a half ago, same 
mode 3, no hardirq's, everything seems to be working fine except for 
kmails total lack of threading causeing composer hangs while a mail 
fetch/spamassassin run is in progress.  But thats not anything new to 
this patchset, its an equal opportunity annoyer.
