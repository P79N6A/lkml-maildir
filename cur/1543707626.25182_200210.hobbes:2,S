Hi Andrew,
OpenGFS and Sistina GFS use zap_page_range directly, essentially doing the 
same as invalidate_mmap_range but skipping any vmas belonging to MAP_PRIVATE 
mmaps.  This avoids destroying data on anon pages.  GPFS and every other DFS 
have the same problem as far as I can see, and it isn't addressed by 
exporting invalidate_mmap_range as it stands.  Paul?
Regards,
Daniel
