	There are a lot of things you should not do in a signal handler, this is
one of them. There are a lot of possible solutions. My recommendation would
be to handle the death of a child from a safe context, rather than from a
signal handler. For example, the SIGCHLD handler could just set a volatile
variable to 'true' and then the code could notice that from a safe context
and loop on 'waitpid', reaping all dead children.
