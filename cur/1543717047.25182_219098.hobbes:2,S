Are you saying that your driver uses /usr/include/linux/usb.h ?
If so, that's wrong.  It should use linux-2.4.18/include/linux/usb.h
instead, and it will if you build/make the driver correctly.
So, how do you build this driver?  Show the Makefile or command
line that you use.
Regarding the data structure, I don't know what /usr/include/linux/usb.h
on your system contains since that is not a kernel header file (and
drivers shouldn't use those).  I do recall, however, that many moons
ago, there were some usb structs in usb.h that were not defined
with __attribute__((packed)), and that could cause field offsets
to be off a bit, er, byte (or more).
And what processor arch. are you doing this on?
Driver source code?
