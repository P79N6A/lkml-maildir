I see, thanks for the explanation.
It doesn't look like SMP swsusp would work reliably on platforms where
there's a possibility of the cpu maps in the resume and saved images
not matching (e.g. ppc64 logical partitions, where cpu 0 could be
removed before suspending).  But I guess that's largely a theoretical
concern at this time. ;)
