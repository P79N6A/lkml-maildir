Subject: [PATCH -mm 0/2] Separate freezer from PM code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
The first patch in the series separates the tasks freezer from the PM code and
moves it to kernel/freezer.c .  Some cleanups of freezer.c proposed by Gautham
will be sent in a separate patch.
The second one moves all of the freezer-specific per-task flags to a separate
filed of task_struct and defines functions for manipulating them with the help
of set_bit() and friends.  I think I have addressed all of the outstanding
issues with it.
The patches are against 2.6.21-rc7-mm2 with the Gautham's patch from
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/26/250
 applied.
Greetings,
Rafael
