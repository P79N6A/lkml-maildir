this is a well known 2.6 oom-killer problem w/o swap. Not the worst one,
I mentioned the worst one here just a few weeks ago:

the only fix at the moment is to use 2.4 with oom killer disabled (the
same issue could happen with 2.4 too). even if it would work better than
the above the oom killer will still get screwed by mlock and it simply
cannot know how much lowmem is freeable leading to deadlock instead of
-ENOMEM with syscalls if you fill the whole lowmem zone.
I fixed everything related to oom in 2.4 some year back, now need to
port to 2.6.
workaround is to add swap in 2.6, but in some condition it'll still
underpeform compared to 2.4 due the lack of the zone-reserve-ratio algo.
