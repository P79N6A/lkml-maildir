Hi. I have posted this on a few forums,and some people suggested that
I post it here to see if I could get any help. I recently complied a
2.6.19 kernel. I realized that I needed to compile in support for
iptables,so I put in xtables and iptables. However,when I booted up
the kernel,I got the repeating message "atkbd.c Spurious ACK on
isa0060/serio0" and the system hung. This can be fixed if I take out
xtables support. I was wondering if anyone knew why xtables was
causing this,I don't want to go online without having iptables. Thanks
for your help.
