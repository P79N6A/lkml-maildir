-  Laptops. Lots of vendors, multiple product lines.
-  prebuilt systems with custom boards from Dell/Compaq.
-  The obvious motherboard vendors (ABit, Asus, Tyan, Soyo etc etc)
-  Vendor reference boards from AMD, VIA, SiS, ALi etc etc.
-  The seemingly endless cheap no-name boards from Taiwan.
-  Mulitple versions of BIOSen for all the above.
   Some with good DMI/some bad/some bad for different reasons etc.
Still think that '150' systems sounds right ?
Dell alone have probably achieved that in their product line over
the last three years.
And whilst DMI is a dying standard, its still present in a lot of
new boxes, and will probably still continue to for some for a while.
