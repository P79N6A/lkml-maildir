Solaris only runs on large computers. You don't want kprobes randomly on
your phone, pda, wireless router. Solaris deals with an extremely narrow
market segment of "big computers for people with lots of money".

Enterprise users generally get kernels from vendors who have done the
analysis of needs for them (and hopefully got it right). They generally
don't ftp 2.6.8.1 type make config and try it out.

We have crash dumps - at least all the enterprise vendors do. Linus
doesn't seem to like that stuff so much.

Actually I generally
-	Glance across the load meters
-	Ask ps where everything is waiting
-	Potentially turn on oprofile
-	Potentially use netfilter to see who is causing all my traffic
-	Maybe strace a few apps to see what is up
-	Educate the user concerned (if needed)
I've already got the symbols (and they are in the debuginfo package from
the rpm build too). I could insmod kgdb but that level of
debugging is generally inappropriate. 
DTrace value is ease of use value.

Coo I thought only the Sun CEO spent his life making inappropriate
