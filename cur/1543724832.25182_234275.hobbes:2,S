Thanks Andrea,

When do you think it is going to happen ?
To be honest I recently was quite happy with 2.6.x stability, and in
2.6.7  IO performance for MySQL workloads seems to be mainly fixed - it
performs well even with default "as" scheduler.   However this problem
makes me to be more cautious once again.

The reason for me to disable swap both in 2.4 and 2.6 is - it really
hurts performance. In some cases performance can be 2-3 times slower
with swap file enabled.   Using O_DIRECT and mlock() for buffers helps 
but not completely.
RedHat 2.4.x kernels are especially affected.  They seems to love to get
a lot of swap into the swap, however caching the large part of swapped
out. This still negatively affects performance.
