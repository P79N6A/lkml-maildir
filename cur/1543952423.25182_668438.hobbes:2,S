Offtopic. Bsd-accounting is system wide. I can't understand what should
we do if multiple namespaces do acct_on().

I think the patch is correct, but let's suppose that a sub-namespace does
accounting, and the task from the parent namespace exits. With this patch
we report ac.ac_pid == 0, which is a bit strange. But the question is,
should we see the tasks from the parent namespace at all?
Perhaps, the task shouldn't account itself if it doesn't "belong" to
acct_globals.ns ? In that case we don't need other changes to figure
out ac.ac_pid/ac_ppid.
Better yet, perhaps acct_on() should be forbidden for non-root ns?
(but the patch itself is correct afaics)
Oleg.
