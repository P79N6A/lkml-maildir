Thanks for the info.
What about apps like git?
i.g. when changing a file
it knows that the file was changed;
(not sure how it works, remembers
 the size or something like that);
With the file indexing is it smart(like git) enough
to know that the data was changed, or does it just
go by the name.  With running SELinux I'm able to
change wpa_supplicant.conf with different ssid's
and keys and there wont be a denial, but If I change
out libflashplayer.so with a newer or same plugin
I will receive a denial. (bad example but all I could think of)
So it does have an idea to when a file is changed.
personally having mechanisms know exactly when
a file was changed internally is nice, this way
you at least are aware
that something has changed, and you know where.
