Back in 2.4.4, Alan submitted a few patches to Linus to add the
following code to i82365.c:
      /*
      SS_DETECT events need a small delay here. The reason for this is that
      the "is there a card" electronics need time to see the card after the
      "we have a card coming in" electronics have seen it.
      */
     if (events & SS_DETECT)
           mdelay(4);
Unfortunately, there are no specifics about the problem.  Since I'm
eliminating the work queue handlers in the pcmcia socket drivers,
this fix doesn't have a logical place inside the socket driver itself.
However, I don't want to loose the fix - it is there to work around some
problem someone was seeing.  If anyone had a problem around this time,
and this fixed it for them, please get in contact with me.
Thanks.
