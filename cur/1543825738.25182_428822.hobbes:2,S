We have to get to the bottom of this - there's a shadow over about 500
patches and we don't know which.
iirc I tried to reproduce this a couple of weeks back and failed.
Are you able to narrow it down to a particular LTP test?  It was mtest01 or
something like that?  Perhaps we can identify a particular command line
which triggers the fault in a standalone fashion?
And why can't I make it happen?  Perhaps it's a memory initialisation
problem, and it only happens to hit in that stage of LTP because that's
when you started doing page reclaim, or something?  Perhaps just
try putting a heap of memory pressure on the machine, see what
that does?
Being unable to reproduce it and not having a theory to go on leaves us
kinda stuck.  Help, please?
