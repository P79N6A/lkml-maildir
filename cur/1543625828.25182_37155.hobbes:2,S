It is trivial to catch such bugs at runtime. I tried it a year ago, and
immediately run into sleep_on() users that legitimately call
spin_lock_irq() with disabled interrupts. Perhaps they are gone now,
I'll retest my patch.

OTHO, if a function doesn't work correctly if it's called with disabled
interrupts, then it should not use spin_lock_irqsave() - it's
misleading.
e.g. if it calls kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL), down(), schedule(), etc.
