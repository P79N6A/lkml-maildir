Evgeniy, i'm not sure how many different ways to tell this to you, but 
you are not listening, you are not learning and you are still not 
getting it at all.
The scheduler /IS/ a generic work/event queue. And it's pretty damn 
fast. No amount of badmouthing will change that basic fact. Not exactly 
as fast as a special-purpose queueing system (for all the reasons i 
outlined to you, and which you ignored), but it gets pretty damn close 
even for the web workload /you/ identified, and offers a user-space 
programming model that is about 1000 times more useful than 
state-machines.
