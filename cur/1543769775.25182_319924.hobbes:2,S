Linus, please do not apply patches from me which have my personal
information mangled or removed. I object to having my contributions
anonymised in this way, just as I object to the contributions of others
being anonymised. This makes it harder to contact those responsible for
changes which are committed via Russell's trees, and makes a nonsense of
the practice of including Signed-off-by: lines from the contributor.
If Russell thinks that he's bound by the UK's Data Protection Act, then
he presumably thinks that he's also obliged to honour my demand that he
correct my personal information in his 'database'. His nonsensical
amateur interpretation of the law would put him in a Catch-22 situation.
