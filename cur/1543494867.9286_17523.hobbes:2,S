Two points...
1]	
Mr. Thompson's views are to be noted, however harsh they might be - based on his
eminence in the field of
computer science, and specifically the arena of operating systems design and
coding.
2]
Even Einstein dismissed out of hand both the big bang theory, and the entire
field of quantum physics - he then spent his remaining years pursuing a dead end
trying to prove the steady state universe.
Even "gods" can get it wrong.
As with physicists that came after Einstein's early ( productive ) years, who
built on his discoveries - those who work on linux are building on what Ken
Thompson has contributed to the intellectual pool of the world.
