I just tried booting with the pmtmr enabled and incoming ssh is bad
(I had an ls pause for over 20 seconds, while another connection was
somewhat fine).  I wish I had more concrete tests since the problems
I'm seeing are so subjective.  I guess I'll have to ignore this
problem until I get a better test.
