Not a problem.  ALSA does software mixing for chipsets that can't do it
in hardware.  Google for dmix.
However this doesn't (and can't be made to) work with the in-kernel OSS
emulation (it works fine with the alsa-lib/libaoss emulation).  So you
are technically correct in that two OSS apps can't open /dev/dsp at the
same time, but there is no problem with multiple apps sharing the sound
device, as long as they use the ALSA API (which they should be using
anyway).
