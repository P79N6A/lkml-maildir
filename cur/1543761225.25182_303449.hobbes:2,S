It appears this was added by the patch shown here:
http://lwn.net/Articles/122581/
The reason given was that if the read or write doesn't use all of the 
available space due to end-of-file, etc. the remaining part of the 
buffer given by the user is not checked for accessibility, thereby 
hiding bugs. It makes little sense for an app to do a read or write with 
a buffer larger than the space that they've actually allocated.
I can see how this might be a problem when using gets, since there is no 
way to know how big the buffer that has been allocated by the 
application is.
Note that access_ok only does a rudimentary check to determine if the 
address might be a valid user-space address, it does not check every 
page to determine if it is accessible or not like verify_area did (and 
copy_to/from_user does).
