i've uploaded the latest, 2.4.17-A0 IRQ-rate-limiting patch to:
        
http://redhat.com/~mingo/irqrate-patches/
this is just a straightforward port to 2.4.17. The patch, while it adds
the dynamic hard-IRQ-limiting feature and fixes softirq performance, it
also removes more lines of code than it adds.
comments, bug reports and suggestions are welcome,
	Ingo
