Quick comment, there is one fundamental difference between your
stand-alone drivers and what most other people talk about in this
discussion: you provide source!
However I still think that drivers residing in the kernel tree is the
right way to go, it is such a pain maintenance wise having to deal
with modules coming from the outside - PCMCIA is a perfect example of
this.
