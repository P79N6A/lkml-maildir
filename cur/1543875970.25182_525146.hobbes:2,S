Ok. Failed to mention one important step -> alt-sysrq-7. With alt-sysrq-{1...6}
it does not hang.
1. boot the system and login as root
2. load netconsole (insmod netconole.ko netconsole=blah... blah...)
3. issue alt-sysrq-7
4. unplug the cable (link goes down)
5. system is frozen until forced to reboot

Yes, just tested it. Sorry. It doesn't change anything.
