List,
Well everythings working fine in test9-pre5 except for the fact that sound
has stopped functioning on my es1371 card.  I had no problems with it at
all in test7 but since then it doesn't work.  On boot it detects normally,
pops and crackles for a second, and then just doesn't work.  Any
ideas?  I'm getting no kernel messages or any output that would  indicate
the problem.
Thanks,
Kris
