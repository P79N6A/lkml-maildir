Two months ago I started a thread
    BUG: fb_imageblit called before fb_check_var and fb_set_par function
in the Linux-fbdev-devel mailing list. I found that the accelerated 
imageblit
function of a framebuffer driver might be called before the graphics 
engine is
initialized ... normally that happens in the fb_set_par function. For 
cyblafb
I solved the problem by extending the fb_sync function to include a call 
to the
graphics engine init function after a short timeout, but the problem is 
still
present in all recent kernels. It might be argued that this is not a 
kernel bug
but a problem of  X - have a look at the Linux-fbdevel thread.
Does X start reliably without a linux framebuffer driver?
Does X start reliably with vesafb?
If the answer is "yes", then have a look at the radeonfb sync function.
After a short timeout, assume that an erroneous X driver disabled mmio,
so (re)enable mmio  and (re)init the graphics engine.
