Why not,  they are perfectly legal?

Yes auto-configured have fe80:0:0:0: in their upper 64 bits,  but that
is just for autoconfigured addessses.  That is a seperate issue to which
prefix desinates link local.
Connected routes don't have to be /64,  things work correctly even if
one picks any other value.

No - what I'm saying is that all link locals should go to the link.
There is no risk inherent in using such an address or link local prefix.
If a mechanism is required such that autoconfig generates the correct
type of address,  then add it.  But that doesn't _require_ that
the connected route be /64.
I happen to use link locals like the quite often,  since it makes
testing and reading packet traces a hell of a lot easier.

Why.  In what way is it not 'safe' to have any link local address
sent onto the link?  They'll either reach a destination or not,
but given that they'll never leave the link,  they can't be inherently
unsafe.
