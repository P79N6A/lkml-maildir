I noticed this a long time ago in the Linux kernel
makefiles, I thought someone would have figured it
out by now tho.
The `gcc -o /dev/null' is a really neat way of
testing if gcc works or not.
Unfortunatly it doesnt work that well if you're root.
You see, gcc uses unlink(). /dev/null doesnt take
kindly to that kind of treatment...
Ofcourse, you cant unlink /dev/null unless you are root.
In any case, the `gcc -o /dev/null' test cases probably
need to go away.
I've seen this in linux/arch/i386/Makefile for 2.4.10,
it probably exists in all previous versions as well as
in other Makefiles.
Happy kernel hacking!
