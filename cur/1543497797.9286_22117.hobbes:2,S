Fortunately, since Linux is OSS, if the "influential people" do stupid
decisions, it's possible for anyone to prove them wrong by implementing
whatever anyway.
When I originated this thread I just wanted to know where to find
information about this as an ongoing project and who to talk to, not start
a debate on whether it's a good or bad thing. I think everybody agrees
that it's a good thing _if the architecture sacrifice is not huge_. So the
future work will tell.
