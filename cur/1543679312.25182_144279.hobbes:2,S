Alexander,
	Why don't we have centralized /proc/filesystems access ? 2 fields
file for fs can't be a standard
Take a look at slab outputs evolution for instance....

Fabian

Yes.  Layout of files in procfs should be treated as a part of ABI.
IOW, you make incompatible change - things break.
Folks, file in /proc is not different from a syscall in that respect -
changing layout has the same effect as changes of layout in syscall
arguments.
IOW, don't do that.
