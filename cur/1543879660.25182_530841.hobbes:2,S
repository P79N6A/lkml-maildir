I will send it to you off-list. I've been avoiding to publish it for a long
time because the stock scheduler was *very* sensible to trivial attacks
(freezes larger than 30s, impossible to log in). It's very basic, and I
have no problem sending it to anyone who requests it, it's just that as
long as some distros ship early 2.6 kernels I do not want it to appear on
mailing list archives for anyone to grab it and annoy their admins for free.
Cheers,
Willy
