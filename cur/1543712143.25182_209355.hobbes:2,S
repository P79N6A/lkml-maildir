Anybody wanna give this a quick test?  It doesn't actually _do_ anything 
yet, except attempt to detect the PATA port.

The latter 2.6 patch applies to the current BK tree, will be -bk6 when 
that snapshot is generated tonight.  It _should_ apply to earlier 
2.6.5-rc2, but applying to earlier kernels you -may- need to 
s/pci_dma_mapping_error/pci_dma_error/, or completely remove the 
pci_dma_[mapping_]error() check.
