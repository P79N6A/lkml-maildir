Michael, I'm assuming that a) this problem remains in those -mm kernels
which include git-acpi.patch and that b) the problems are not present in
2.6.13-rc5 or 2.6.13-rc6, yes?
So I think we have a bug in git-acpi.patch?
If that's all correct then can you please test the next -mm (which will
include git-acpi.patch - the most recent -mm did not) and if the bug's
still there can you raise a bugzilla.kernel.org entry for it?
We seem to have a handful of bug reports against the -mm acpi patch.
Thanks.
