then that is bad and sick HW design.
for example. cpu fan is supposed to full speed, if SW send insane
instruction and lose connection.
also, CPU should shutdown by thermal strip is FAN is stopped.
when we were working on LinuxBIOS, found one MB cpu fan need to be
started by BIOS, and another one is auto full speed if BIOS don't
touch it. We always like the second design.
