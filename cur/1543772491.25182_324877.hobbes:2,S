During the earlier thread, I did suggest a third option which I think
could help integrate both PREEMPT_RT and the interrupt pipeline in
Adeos and RTAI-fusion _without_ impacting on the rest of the kernel
code. However, I haven't received any feedback whatsoever in that
regard. So here it is again. Given how much discussion space is taken
on "concepts", it may be worth entertaining a third option.

Let me clarify what I say above to make it clear that linux/hard-rt
and include/linux-hrt/ could/would include a merged PREEMPT_RT, adeos, and
rtai-fusion. The combo patch put together by Philippe (which includes both
PREEMPT_RT and adeos) is already a good start in that direction. Like we
said earlier, both methods are not mutually exclusive.
Note that my purpose by posting this proposal is to invite further
discussion as to what is the best way to integrate any real-time approach
to the existing kernel structure. What approach eventually makes it into
this structure, whether it be PREEMPT_RT, Adeos, fusion, a combination of
these, or something entirely different, is not something I attempt to
resolve here. As it currently stands, for PREEMPT_RT at least, the
intrusiveness of the patch onto the mainstream code is something that
seems to make a lot of people uneasy.
