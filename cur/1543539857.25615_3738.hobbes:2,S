Do you want to do low-level maintenance/diagnostics on a drive in situ, on
a production machine? I wouldn't. At the very least, I'd prefer to pull
the drive, plug it into another machine and do the work there. On such a
machine, the drives will be hot-pluggable, I suspect...

Nice and clean is not a term I'd apply to your approach.

You need to take the drive offline anyway. I'd prefer to avoid running any
low-level diagnostics on a production machine if I can avoid that.
I certainly don't want to see my hard drive tied to ANY particular OS, or
group of OSs, which the vendor deigns to support. How could this be
avoided with your method??
James.
