My controller is just a shift register that I can set the  
characteristics of (bit length for example, reverse data).

The mode register is shared between chipselects so I'll go pull the  
patches from -mm for setup_transfer().  That sounds like the right  
place for setting my mode register.

Why deal with just clock polarity and not clock phase as well in  
chipselect()?
It sounds like with the new patch, I'll end up setting txrx_word[] to  
the same function for all modes.
