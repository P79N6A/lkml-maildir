	I will thanks, but I must say that I did already
	rewrite the partition table.
	i.e., I wrote in a paper the values of my previous
	partition table, then I delete all the linux
	partitions and finally I rewrote them again (with
	the same values it had).  But it doesn't work  =-(
	But I'm gonna try with gpart and I'll tell you if
	it works.
	Thank you.
