Well, the question is if you can keep the seekdir/telldir cookie around 
as a pointer -- preferrably in userspace, of course.  You would 
presumably garbage-collect them on closedir() -- there is no other point 
at which you could.
I personally suspect that hch is right -- this stuff has been there 
since time immemorial and it'll be hard or impossible to deprecate it.
