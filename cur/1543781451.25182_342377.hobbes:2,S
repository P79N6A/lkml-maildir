I verified that I have not explicitly set nonblocking on the socket, so expect 
it to be default blocking.

This behavior, manifesting itself as a CPU loop, has been plaguing me for a 
number of months now.  It is not specific to the latest kernel since  it 
happened on FC3 and all kernels between.  Before FC3 I was on RHEL3 (2.4 
kernel) but am unsure if I saw the problem there, my best guess is that it is 
2.6 related, but I cannot guarantee that.
I have a workaround for the problem (sleep 200ms), but can repeat it and will 
be happy to provide more info as you request.  
The only thing I would correct in what I initially wrote is I believe that the 
other end of the socket did read some of the data I wrote before I did my 
read() expecting it to block.
