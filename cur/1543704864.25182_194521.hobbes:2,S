	With pci=noacpi the system does not boot: it hangs during
the 3ware initialization - prints the following message:
3w-xxxx: scsi0: UNIT #0: Command (000001002645b0) timed out, resetting card
3w-xxxx: scsi0: UNIT #0: Command (000001002645b0) timed out, resetting card
Then it tries the same with UNIT #1 (whatever it is) and then the system
locks up.
	With acpi=off it boots correctly. I will try it in another
Tyan S2882 box - it may be a faulty mainboard.

 Any compiler or language that likes to hide things like memory allocations
 behind your back just isn't a good choice for a kernel.   --Linus Torvalds
