As I understand this code, this is trying to swap the start and end of
"different" regions. Start and end of same region will always be sorted 
and end will appear after start (As we check for non-zero size and 
setup change_point in a way that start is before end).
But, there can be end of one region coinciding with start of next
region. 
In which case, this sorting puts the start before the end so that we 
can properly find out overlaps later.
I think the existing code is doing the right thing.
Thanks,
Venki
