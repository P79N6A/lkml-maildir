Yes that makes sense.
The big strategic problem is how to marry your patchkit to John Stultz's
clocksources work which is also competing for merge. Any thoughts on that?

I think a better way to do this would be to define a new CLOCK_THREAD_MONOTONOUS
(or better name) timer for clock_gettime(). 
[and my currently stalled vdso patches that implement clock_gettime
as a vsyscall]
Then also an application could easily use it with LD_PRELOAD
