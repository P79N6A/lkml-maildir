I see on 
http://www.jaquet.dk/kernel/config_tiny/
 the following list 
of 2.5.44 patches:
----  snip  ----
2.5.44-allinone         30-Oct-2002 23:15    23k
2.5.44-config           30-Oct-2002 23:15     1k
2.5.44-initstr          30-Oct-2002 23:11   183k
2.5.44-nohashes         30-Oct-2002 23:11     3k
2.5.44-noinlines        30-Oct-2002 23:19    14k
2.5.44-noscript         30-Oct-2002 23:11     1k
2.5.44-noswap           30-Oct-2002 23:10     6k
----  snip  ----
Just looking at the patch sizes, I thought all are independent 
(though "allinone" indicates something different). So I applied all 
to one tree (which gave the above mentioned result).
Now playing around with the patches shows that 2.5.44-allinone
apparently contains all others _except_ 2.5.44-initstr which is 
completely independent.
Sorry for the confusion.
