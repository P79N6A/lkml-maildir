Hi,
    Is there any simple method to trace which patch removed
the code?
I used the following command to check it..
grep define\ *hpsb_queue_struct\ *tq_struct patch-2.4.21-pre4-ac*
However, i have downloaded the patch from alan cox only...
it dont contain the code. any site have contained all the
patches that is -pre5 based on?
