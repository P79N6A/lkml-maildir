Precedence: bulk

Hi,
The attached patch gets NFS-over-TCP working for the knfsd server. 
It fixes the RPC-interleaving seen over TCP when multiple threads write to
one socket simultaneously. To enable it, apply the patch and configure "NFSD
server over TCP support" in the kernel config before rebuilding. 
Trond has also placed the patch at:
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/2.4.17/linux-2.4.17-svc_tcp.dif
Please feel free to test it and report any problems to the NFS list.
Thanks to Trond for all his help on this patch.
Cheers,
Shirish
