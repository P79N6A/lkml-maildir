Debian defaultly doesn't use framebuffer or any kind of splash screen.
Splash screens are clearly cosmetic, and it's kind of shameful (imo) that 
important messages explaining real problems are obscured from view by 
functionless splash screens.
Personally, I think muddying the vga colour argument with splash screen stuff 
is bogus, they're very functionally separable ideas. A coloured oops seems to 
be a good way of telling novice users what information is relevant to their 
bug report.
