} Unable to bring up the network card with 2.3.47. Card is a 3c509.
} Have rebuilt ifconfig from the latest net-tools (1.54) using the
} 2.3.47 headers, but no effect. Get 'SIOCSIFFLAGS: operation not
} supported by device' when attempting to up the card. Problem on
} i586/i486 UP's.  All works fine in 2.3.46.
} 
} Any suggestions?
