No. struct sockaddr basically holds only the common field "sa_family"
and an array of char which contains the hardware specific data
(see /usr/include/linux/socket.h). It is used by the socket API.
For different hardware types you have other structs, e.g. you have
struct sockaddr_in for IP sockets and struct sockaddr_un for Unix domain
sockets.
sockaddr_in has additionally to the common fields a field for the IP
address "sin_address" and "sin_port" for the port. sockaddr_un has
simply the field "sun_path" for the name in the filesystem.
Just grep for them under /usr/include...
