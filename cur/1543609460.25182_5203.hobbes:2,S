Admins know what they are doing. Your average person trying Linux for the
first time doesn't... You are forgetting that Linux is actually becoming
useful as a desktop OS and a wider audience is starting to use it.
But considering you already get a warning message on insertion that will
do fine, no need to ask are you sure. GUI configuration tools can always
do the "are you sure bit" if they want to.
