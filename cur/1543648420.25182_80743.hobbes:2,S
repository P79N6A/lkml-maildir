lemme get my logs... here it is:
Quoting Al:
"You're free to use, but keep in mind that it's assumed to be constant over
->start/->stop/->next/->show more accurately, there's no sane way to use it as
part of iterator state it's for "which of iterators with similar code it is?"
e.g. /proc/<pid>/mounts uses the same iterator over different namespaces -
depending on pid.  take a look at the way /proc/ksyms is done"
