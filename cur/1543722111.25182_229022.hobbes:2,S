I don't think that number of Linux drivers will grow faster than
Net bandwodth, CPU speeds and disk capacity. So, in relative terms
downloading and compiling kernel tarballs will not become slower.
Keeping drivers in single place greatly improves chances of peer
review, bit rot prevention (think about fixes for newer GCC versions),
etc.
