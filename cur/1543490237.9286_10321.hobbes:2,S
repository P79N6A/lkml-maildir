I did have this very long retort, but after reviewing it I've decided
it's just not worth debating you on this.
Yes, I read you message, and in context.  I simply didn't agree with the
first sentence.  The latest distributions are glibc based, but many
people aren't on the latest distribution.  Libc5 base systems are very
much in current use right now, and for many upgrading is an effort they
are not ready to make.  There is too much incompatibility between glibc
and libc5.
Now, the original thread stated a problem with Bind 8.2 using one header
file without including other well-known header files.  To that end, the
maintainer of Bind should correct the code.  There are well established
programming practices for building networking apps, after all.
Perhaps my "rant" was a little on the righteous side.  If so, I
apologize.  I just want to ensure that we keep our options open for
distributions.
Are we done now?
