Subject: [PATCH 2/2] kconfig.debug menu dependencies
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/27/164

From: Randy Dunlap <randy.dunlap@oracle.com>
DEBUG_FS, HEADERS_CHECK, and UNWIND don't depend on DEBUG_KERNEL but
they were stuck into the middle of the DEBUG_KERNEL menu, so move
them up above it (since it continues wherever lib/Kconfig.debug was
sourced into, hence below it won't work).
Also make LKDTM depend on DEBUG_KERNEL, as other test modules do
(e.g., RT MUTEX TESTER, RCU TORTURE TEST).
