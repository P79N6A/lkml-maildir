Its just a theory that makes sense to me, but yes we need to be measure it.

I strongly believe so, its a memory hungry benchmark - I'll collect status later 
on this week or the next.

We could handle such situation on allocation and during vmscan - maybe its doable.
Just pondering, maybe its indeed too messy to even ponder about.
