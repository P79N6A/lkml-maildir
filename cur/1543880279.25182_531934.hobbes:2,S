Out of curiosity, why not to fix a netlink_dump_start() to remove
callback in error path, since in 'no-error' path it removes it in
netlink_dump().
And, btw, can release method be called while socket is being used, I
thought about proper reference counters should prevent this, but not
100% sure with RCU dereferencing of the descriptor.
