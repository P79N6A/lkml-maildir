Subject: [HANG] Checking root filesystem and then...

Running on a Netfinity x340 box (single PIII, ServRAID card and 
Adaptec 29160LP card, boot disk is ext2 and is attached to the 
ServRAID card), a stock 2.4.10 kernel gets to the point of "Checking 
root filesystem" and the system simply stops dead in its tracks.
It stops at the line initlog -c "fsck -T -a $fsckoptions /" If I 
remove the "initlog", it still stops. If I remove the "fsck", it 
stops at the next line (mount -n -o remount, rw /)!
I have systematically tried a number of different kernels and have 
discovered that
2.4.10-pre5 works
2.4.10-pre6 hangs
2.4.9-ac7 works
2.4.9-ac8 hangs
How many others are seeing this behavior?
Does anyone recognize something that changed in these kernels that 
could be responsible? The only thing I notice in common in the change 
logs are references to gendisk. (I am not sure how that could be 
responsible as the boot disk is a SCSI disk managed the ServRAID 
driver.)
Does anyone have any idea how this could be further investigated?
