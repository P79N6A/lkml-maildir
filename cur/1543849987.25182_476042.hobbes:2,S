Unfortunately not.  Saving a cycle or two doesn't help when a vm exit 
costs thousands of cycles, and worse, kills your tlb.
The key is eliminating unnecessary exits.  I have plans for massively 
optimizing the mmu virtualization, and the next AMD core will do that in 
hardware (look for a "nested page tables" sticker before you buy).
