None, but then it's not a Linux-only program that you're compiling.
(Nor is it Linux-in-2009-only).
If you _know_ you're running on Linux from a particular era, you can
provide a config.cache file with the correct answers already filled in.
I agree that Autoconf sucks (I've written enough sucking Autoconf
macros myself, I hate it), but the tough part is providing a suitable
replacement when you still want portable source code.

You seem to be arguing for "let's make all our programs Linux-specific
(and Glibc-specific in many cases)".  Given all the problems you've
seen with cross-compiling, let alone compiling for different OS
platforms, that seems a little odd.
