Subject: Changing sysctl values within the kernel?

Hi all,
I'm working on a kernel module and want to change sysctl values (specifically 
stop-a and printk) in response to a hardware event.
Is there an accepted way of setting sysctl values within the kernel (I can't 
seem to find any other module doing this), or is it a completely silly idea?
Would it perhaps be better to instead create a sysfs node and let a userspace 
daemon worry about setting the sysctl values?
Any advice greatly appreciated!
David.
