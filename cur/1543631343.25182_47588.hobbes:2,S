There are definitely good things in both trees for this problem area at
the moment. If you're interested in fixing this Alan and Andrea, let's start a 
mergefest. I'm sure I can volunteer some IBM resources to help port patches, 
and test the hell out of it .... if you're willing to consider taking things, I'll draw
up a list of what the issues are, what patches are available, and which
trees they reside in (often none ;-( )
If my spies are correct, 7.3AS kernel is still based off the old 2.4.9 VM, with
no rmap at present ... correct? I presume 7.3 is 2.4.18 or so VM with rmap?
