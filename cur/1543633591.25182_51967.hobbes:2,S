Re-allocation of tables when adding CPUs is another
option.  That means the data moves - so others have to store
array indices instead of direct pointers to stuff they use.
Dynamic allocation not merely at boottime, but everytime.
Adding a CPU becomes more expensive, but that won't
happen hundreds of times a second anyway.
