Incidentally, when doing a build after these patches, I'm seeing:
arch/arm/plat-omap/dma.c: In function `omap_get_dma_src_pos':
arch/arm/plat-omap/dma.c:750: warning: 'offset' might be used uninitialized in this function
arch/arm/plat-omap/dma.c: In function `omap_get_dma_dst_pos':
arch/arm/plat-omap/dma.c:772: warning: 'offset' might be used uninitialized in this function
These look like they're valid warnings to me.
