Subject: [PATCH 2.6.17-rc5-mm2 00/18] ieee1394: misc updates
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Andrew,
here is a bunch of IEEE 1394 subsystem patches which have been floating
around for a while.  Some of them have already been in git-ieee1394 and/
or in -mm (before git-ieee1394 dropout).  All of them went through
linux1394-devel, except the sem2mutex patch.  They do not depend on each
other except where noted.  Noted below are the dates of first posts, not
of subsequent patch updates or resubmissions.  Two or three recent 1394
subsystem patches which may need more review or rework are not included
here.
Dear lkml readers, the age of some of the patches does not mean they
have become perfect.  Yell if you spot any goofiness.

[07/18] ieee1394: support for slow links or slow 1394b phy ports
2006-03-26 me
Fixes a long-standing incompatibility to two less common classes of IEEE
1394a and IEEE 1394b devices (devices with link speed slower than PHY
speed, devices with S100B...S400B PHY ports) and to the case of two
1394b PHYs connected via 1394a cable.
Still missing feature: expose negotiated port speeds to userspace
[08/18] ieee1394: save RAM by using a single tlabel for broadcast transactions
2006-03-26 me
saves much less RAM than length of title suggests :-)
