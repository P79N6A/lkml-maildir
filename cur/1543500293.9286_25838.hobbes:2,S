        If I remember correctly, sometime around the 2.1.44 - 2.1.50 era, when 
kerneld was replaced by kmod, Linus had mentioned something to the fact that he 
does not use modules. Those that are maintaining the part of module development 
would know what to do with modules. Plus, that's where configuring comes in, in 
a developmental series. YOU get to choose what YOU want to go into the kernel, 
or what *YOU* want to have modularised. That is a choice everyone makes. I make 
it. everyone else does too.

        Once again, as someone else had previously listed, the whole bottom 
third of /usr/src/linux/README covers what to do if something goes wrong. This 
could fall under RTFM, but I won't go down that road. Same thing applies to the 
2.2.x tree, when things are stable. you can't predict when a bug comes up, or 
that everything will be idiotproof.. But Linus, Alan, and everyone else here, 
does a damn good job of getting close to it. :)

        You know.. he sort of does that. If you've noticed, there is 
linux-kernel-announce, in which you are announced when kernels are released. If 
you have the time to go on regarding this, it should take just as long to do 
both of these compiles, on a 4-way pentium. Plus, you may also want to consider 
doing that on all the architectures that is supported under Linux. (Note: I 
still haven't seen an Atari 68000K machine running linux yet. VIC-20, yes. 
Apple IIe, yes. anything else, no.) Plus, as mentioned before, Linus doesn't 
use modules.

        Isn't this what a mailing list, such as this, is for? Linus even 
mentioned when 2.3.7 was released, that there may be compilation problems, due 
to new things he was developing. Also.. what about those, who don't need to use 
FAT at all? for the most, the bug report may not apply. My box is using 
linux totally, but I have FAT compiled as a module. I took the notes that Linus 
sent, as a warning when using the kernel. There's always going to be some 
problem in a devel series. when they come up, we fix it. that's what 
'developmental' is all about!

        Once again, what about those that don't use it at all? should they 
suffer a set back in development, because of this?

        If you're doing quality assurance for linux, then doing it in a 
Developmental series is _NOT_ the right place to do it. stick that, back with 
2.2.x, or please be like others, and wait patiently, until things have settled 
and the bug fixed, and resume. Or, do more above that, and HELP IN SOLVING it. 
Ranting won't get the problem solved.
                                                        BL.
