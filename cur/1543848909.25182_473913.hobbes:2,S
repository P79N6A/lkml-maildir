In my many rounds of research on this, I'm pretty sure that this is the
same setup as the lifebook.
Wether the implementation is the same, is a matter of conjecture as long
as I can't see the device.
Both of you suggested checking the PS/2 under windows, unfortunatly I
know of no "sniffer" type drivers or apps
to listen directly on a logical PS/2 interface.  If you know where I can
find something like that that would be of more help than anything at
this point.

The touchscreen might need a "magic knock" to activate. You might try to
see what data wondows driver sends to PS/2 port.
Also check of Lifebook touchscreen protocol will work for you. You will
need to adjust DMI table in drivers/input/mouse/lifebook.c/

But you must be subscribed to post otherwise list just drops your mails
