Well we can toss stuff into -mm any old time really.  Doing it too early
will cause rather a lot of difficulty and churn at both ends - working
against -mm can be an extra burden at times.
I'd say that it would be best to wait until the code is, in your opinion,
in a Linus-mergeable form.  Then after one lkml review round and any
subsequent rework we should be in good shape.
