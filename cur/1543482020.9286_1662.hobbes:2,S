Maybe mine sees more disk activity than most, but pre8 and pre9 die
with SCSI errors whenever they hit a really big load of disk activity
(like doing a find over the whole disk, which happens every morning at
6:30 or so...).
I can't help but notice that the version of the NCR driver appears to
have changed with pre8.  This didn't happen with older versions.
I get the following messages:
