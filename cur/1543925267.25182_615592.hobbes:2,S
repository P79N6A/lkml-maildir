I presume the issue is not a driver bug per-se, but a
spying/hacking-type security issue: Having root in one guest could in
principle allow one to write a driver that snooped on data in other
guests, and/or intentionally corrupted data on other guests.
I envision some ISP renting out 1/3 of a machine with a 4-port card,
and having some nosey college-kid wannabe hacker getting root on one of
the guests and causing trouble.  But perhaps I'm waaaayyyyy off base
here.
(Just like occasional cigarette smoking is known to inevitably lead to
full-fledged heroin addiction, I am pretty sure that the culture of
"cheat codes" among 12-year-olds is going to lead to an epidemic of
hackers in about 10 years. I am atuned to "wannabe hacker culture").
