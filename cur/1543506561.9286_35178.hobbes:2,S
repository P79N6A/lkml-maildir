Hi out there!
I remember someone posted a patch some month ago that uses the
International Kernel Patch by Alex Kjeldaas to encrypt user's home
directories (transparently).
Unfortunately, I seem to cannot find the original post anymore
(searching for crypto and/or laptop does not yield a message in the last
two months or so; the kernel archive search on www.kernelnotes.org is
disabled)
Can someone please provide me with the URL to the patch or (better
still) the mail address of it's author?
I want to include a discussion of this in the forthcoming
Encryption-HOWTO...
Thanks,
Marc
