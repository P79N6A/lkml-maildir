That's what I feared. You have a prefetch or mb() in an __exit
function. Basically it's an binutils design bug, but hard to fix
according to the binutils hackers.
The only fix I know currently is to remove the .exit.text
discard from arch/i386/vmlinux.lds.S. It'll increase the kernel
text size slightly because functions that would only be needed
for module unload in some drivers will be compiled in too. 
But it's probably not too bad, at worst a few KB.
