I don't particularly like the name neither, I just couldn't think of a better
one.

Ok, I'll do in 2.5.
I extracted the pure bugfix parts of my patch for 2.4. dcache.c uses 
list_empty() several times to check if a dentry is unhashed or not. 
This requires a INIT_LIST_HEAD after the list_del. Unfortunately some users
forget the INIT_LIST_HEAD, which probably could lead to races.
I added a new inline list_del_init() and fixed the few misusers (and actually
converted a few who use INIT_LIST_HEAD too to make it look nicer).
Please apply the patch (appended)

Sounds like a good way to justify statement expressions ;) 
I've seen similar constructs in perl though and didn't like it too much there.
I'll have to think about it.
Just even with higher level hash table support the low level primitives
like _del, _add etc. would still be needed, and they look very similar
to list_*.
