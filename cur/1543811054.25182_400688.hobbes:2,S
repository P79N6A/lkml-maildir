Well the way to accomplish that is to just load the kernel there and
have it sort itself out.  It would take a rev of the boot protocol
to let the bootloader know it was possible though.

Not really. With the linker able to generate the relocations you can
do it outside of most of the kernel where we have the decompressor.  
Relocating a kernel is fundamentally an architecture dependent thing,
relocations can't work at all on x86-64 for example because of the narrow
window of virtual addresses it needs to run at.
I only haven't submitted the patches because I was too busy stabilizing
the reboot path last time I had time to be working in this area.
After I get some sleep I will dust off my patches and see how
it goes.  x86-64 will probably have regressed but...

It isn't that new.  There has been interest in this area from the
people working on the  kdump stuff for a long you don't require
options under CONFIG_EMBEDDED to build a kernel for capturing a crash
dump. 
CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START was supposed be the simple interim solution
until we could get relocation patches sorted out and merged.
