Hi:
  I have downloaded the kernel2.5.25 and compiled it . After installed 
it,it refuse to
go any further anymore when got to the / mounted and should remout the 
root filesystem
as read and write .
 My system is Redhat 7.3 personal. My cpu is PIII660MHz. What happened 
to that?
Since kernel 2.5.22 it never run successfully on my computer? Does''t 
anyone has the
same problem with me?
Thank you for your help
