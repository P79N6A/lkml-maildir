You got it right Rogier.
There is an uncorrectable timing chatter between the DMA mode 2 WD31600
and the UDMA Maxtor 92720U8.  This is really problematic on the all PIIXx
chipsets that I have observed.  It has nothing to do with Intel's
hardware, it is an issue between the two drive venders.
WD + Maxtor (same channel) == cat and dog in bag.
(One animal is going to damage the other.)
Disable all DMAing for data safety and split the devices to separate
channels.  I do not care what is where.  I fear that you will find
FS-Corruption from the hardware level.  I spent four weeks and daily
reinstalls to finally pick up the phone and call Maxtor.
(Note that WD does not care about Linux, not a viable OS).
There is on a pretty way to impliment this kind of detection, or I would
have.
