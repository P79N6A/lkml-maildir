The git tree at
	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/smurf/linux-trees.git
could be set up in a simpler way:
$ git ls-remote git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/smurf/linux-trees.git

Would it be possible to remove the branches that exist for each
individual version, and to change the "master" tag to a branch?
Since git gives tag names priority over head names, fetching the above
tag makes "master" refer to it instead of any local branch named
"master".
(I get particularly bizarre behavior with current git; after:
	git remote add mm git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/smurf/linux-trees.git
	git fetch mm
when I check out "master", it sets HEAD to refs/heads/master, but the
index and working tree to refs/tags/master.)
I think it may have been set up this way with the idea that a branch
should only ever move "forward" in history, whereas tags could move
around freely.
But that's not really right--for something like -mm that's continually
rewritten and rebased, it makes sense to have a "master" branch that
skips around.  The default git-remote setup on recent git is prepared to
deal with this.
And having a repository with 101 branches and counting, none of which
every change, is awkward--if nothing else it makes the output of
"git-branch -r" a little hard to read.
