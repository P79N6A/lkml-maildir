I just downloaded the patch to kernel 2.3.6 and patched my
2.3.5-kernel-source.
I compiled the kernel, copyied it to /boot/vmlinuz, ran lilo and reboot.
When i was going to boot up linux again i got a lot of error-messages
that i never had before, and the boot-procedure just stop:
___ The error-messages starts here___
sh: error in loading shared libraries
libncurses.so.4: cannot map file data: Cannot allocate memory

___They stop here, and the computer is "dead" and do not react on
anything, not even [Ctrl][Alt][Del]___
The kernel 2.3.3 and 2.3.5 works fine, but not 2.3.6...
Is it a bugg or am i doing something very wrong??
(I use SuSE 6.0 and my computer is a pII 266MHz with 64mb Ram)
