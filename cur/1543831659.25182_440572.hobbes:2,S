Hello,
... wow ... thank you for all the awareness training. I have now a much
better idea what is happening now. And who knows, maybe I am going to submit
some patches when ext4 isn't already released in three months. I didn't
knew about the checksum capability of newer drives. I only new about the
DMA crc. But it is definitively the right way to go.
