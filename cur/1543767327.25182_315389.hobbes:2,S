How to reliably generate universally unique ID's have been well
understood for over twenty years, and is implemented on nearly every
Linux system for over ten.  For more information I refer you to
doc/draft-leach-uuid-guids-01.txt in the e2fsprogs sources, and for an
implementation, the uuid library in e2fsprogs, which is used by both
GNOME and KDE.  UUID's are also used by Apple's Mac OS X (using
libuuid from e2fsprogs), Microsoft Windows, more historically by the
OSF DCE, and even more historically by the Apollo Domain OS (1980 --
1989, RIP).  Much of this usage is due to the efforts of Paul Leach, a
key architect at Apollo, and OSF/DCE, before he left and joined the
Dark Side at Microsoft.
Also, FYI the OSF/DCE, including the specification for generating
UUID's, was submitted by OSF to the X/Open where it was standardized,
who in turn submitted it to the ISO where it was approved as
Publically Available Specification (PAS).  So technically, there *is*
an internationally standardized way of generating UUID's, and it is
already implemented and deployed on nearly all Linux systems.
