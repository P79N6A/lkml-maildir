Hi Mike,
  could you try to apply patch available at
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest/matroxfb.gz?
 It has some
fixes in cursor blinking code, but, I must admit, nothing which could
fix problem you are reporting...
  Now I tried it (my teletext grabber uses ncurses and prints each page
number it receives) and after holding 'shift-pgup' for some time
(more than 15 seconds of strange picture blinks...) it stopped scrolling,
but cursor was still blinking... After I hit shift-pgdn, machine died :-(
So simple do not do it until I did not find what's going on, sorry.
                                                    Best regards,
                                                         Petr Vandrovec
                                                         vandrove@vc.cvut.cz
P.S.: All ideas welcomed...
