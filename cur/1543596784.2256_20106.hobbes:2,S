Hi,
 after going from 2.4.6-ac1 to 2.4.6-ac2 the eepro100 adapter in my IBM
Thinkpad-570 has stopped working. While "ifconfig" shows the expected
info, nothing network related (ping, yp, bind, amd, ...) is working. In
my config, the eepro driver is built directly into the kernel.
 If I look at the interface lights, it seems that the link goes down
early in the boot sequence. The whole thing is reproducible. When
booting -ac1 again, everything is OK.
Martin
