Yes. Oh, you meant a Marvell SATA controller? That's quite different
from a SATA disk. Just use sata_mv.

There is no such thing. The only driver that comes close is the AHCI
driver, but that needs AHCI compatible hardware. In your case: use
sata_mv, it should work fine. If not, see below.

1) Upgrade to the latest kernel (2.6.16.13 or 2.6.17-git9)
2) Try to recreate your problem
3) If it persists, read REPORTING-BUGS in your kernel tree and send in
   a bug report to the appropriate mailing list (linux-ide will do).
