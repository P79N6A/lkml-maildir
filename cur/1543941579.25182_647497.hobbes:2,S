Your fix for this particular warning looks OK.
But always do:
-> One fix per patch
-> Include the warning in the patch descript that you fix
-> Explain why you fixed it the way you did it
Without this info it is too time consuming to try to review your patch
and I did nt look at the other changes you included.
