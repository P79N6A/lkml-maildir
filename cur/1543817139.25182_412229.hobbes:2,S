That's... impressive. Of course the more generality it grows the slower
it must necessarily become, although it'll be a while until its IR is as
bloated and thus as slow as GCC's... (GCC's only slow because of cache
effects, really).

Well, I'd rather he spent time on qemu than tcc; there are other C compilers
but there's nothing quite like qemu (bochs doesn't work very well, valgrind
is similar in essence but very different in operation...)
