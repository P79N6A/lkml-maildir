You would be much better off attaching a straight ADC/DAC at say up to 
256Kbits/8bit sampling and some control lines to the USB. That would also
let people dumb the ridiculous 1960's technology they insist on using and
run serious stuff like adaptive encoders, golay codecs and the like and
bring amateur packet radio out of the stone age
