Subject: [PATCH -mm 5/5] Freezer: Do not send signals to kernel threads
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/18/58

From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl>
The freezer should not send signals to kernel threads, since that may lead to
subtle problems.  In particular, commit b74d0deb968e1f85942f17080eace015ce3c332c
has changed recalc_sigpending_tsk() so that it doesn't clear TIF_SIGPENDING.
For this reason, if the freezer continues to send fake signals to kernel threads
and the freezing of kernel threads fails, some of them may be running with
TIF_SIGPENDING set forever.
Accordingly, recalc_sigpending_tsk() shouldn't set the task's TIF_SIGPENDING
flag if TIF_FREEZE is set.
