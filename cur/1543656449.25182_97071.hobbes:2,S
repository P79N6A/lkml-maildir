Yah a lot of it is like William is saying... you just do not want to
read multiple files for each process in /proc when you have a kajillion
processes, and that is what top does.  Over and over.
Work has gone into 2.5 to make this a lot better.. If you use threads
with NPTL in 2.5, a lot of this is resolved, since the sub-threads will
not show up in as /proc/#/ entries.
