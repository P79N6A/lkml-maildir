WRT ATA and flush-cache...  before the IDE pieces of this patch are 
merged, IMO it is a requirement that the entire flush-cache stuff gets a 
review.  ide_get_error_location() is one of the important pieces 
(great!).  Another important piece is to make sure that a drive's 
flush-cache capability is correctly deduced and set up from the 
identify-device.  The steps look like
- check identify-device word 83, bits 12 (flush cache) and 13 (flush 
cache ext)
- issue set-features command to get flush-cache into proper state 
(enabled or disabled, as the user desires), if identify-device word 86 
indicates it is not already in the state you seek.
- re-read identify [packet] device page from device, make sure 
flush-cache[-ext] is enabled.  A slacker could just make sure the 
set-features command completed successfully, but to be 100% correct you 
need to re-read the identify-device page.  :/
NOTE 1: these steps are specific to the flush-cache command, and are 
only vaguely related to write caching (which must be tested-for and 
enabled separately).  It is important to go through these steps 
separately for write-caching and flush-cache[-ext].
Write-caching and flush-cache-command state should always be considered 
separately, even though the two are often used together.  I want to 
avoid the LG cdrom debacle, where not properly checking for, and setting 
up, flush-cache resulted in turning cdroms into bricks.
NOTE 2: Don't forget to check for 0x0000 or 0xffff in word 86, of 
__only__ identify-packet-device.  These special case meanings do not 
appear for ATA devices, only ATAPI devices.
NOTE 3: flush-cache-ext should always be used on lba48 devices, even if 
the request was inside the lba28 limit.
NOTE 4: flush-cache-ext does not exist on ATAPI devices.
