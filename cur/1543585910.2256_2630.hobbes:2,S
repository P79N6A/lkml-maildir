Just a quick bug-report: 
One of our machines just started spewing:
Out of Memory: Killed process 117 (sendmail).
Out of Memory: Killed process 117 (sendmail).
Out of Memory: Killed process 117 (sendmail).
Out of Memory: Killed process 117 (sendmail).
Out of Memory: Killed process 117 (sendmail).
Out of Memory: Killed process 117 (sendmail).
Out of Memory: Killed process 117 (sendmail).
Out of Memory: Killed process 117 (sendmail).
Out of Memory: Killed process 117 (sendmail).
What we did to run it out of memory, I don't know. But I do know that
it shouldn't be killing one process more than once... (the process
should not exist after one try...)
Kernel 2.4.0 .
