OK, the obvious solution is to use the same approach for subsystem
state objects as we do for the struct cgroup itself - move the calls
to the subsystem destroy methods to cgroup_diput. A control file
dentry will keep alive the parent dir's dentry, which will keep alive
the cgroup and (with this change) the subsystem state objects too.
The only potential drawback that I can see is that an open fd on a
cgroup directory or a control file will keep more memory alive than it
would have done previously.
