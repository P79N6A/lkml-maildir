Subject: [PATCH -mm] [2/3] add list_merge to list.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/3/363

list_merge behaves like list_splice, except it can be used with
headless lists.  that is, the resulting list will have @head
immediately preceeding @list.
This is used by the contig list feature in the Elevator I/O scheduler
