Correct, on my desktop system. However, I have a laptop with an IDE
CDROM, and am able to reproduce the problem there with 2.6.9-rc2-mm1.

Mmm, that's odd. There is next to nothing in common between my two
systems (desktop is AMD-based with VIA chipset and SYM/NCR SCSI adapter,
laptop is Intel-based with Intel chipset). Oh, the only common point I
can think of is the underlying Linux distro, namely up-to-date Slackware
9.1.
...
Being admittedly lost, I decided to do the only thing I could...
Starting from 2.6.9-rc2-bk1, I incrementally applied all changesets from
bk1 to bk2 as found on linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5, and test each
time. I wasted quite a few hours on this, but not in vain. The changeset
triggering the problem is this one:
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/cset@1.1891
It looks totally unrelated. As to why it causes a problem to only me,
don't ask, I have no idea.
Does it help?
Thanks.
