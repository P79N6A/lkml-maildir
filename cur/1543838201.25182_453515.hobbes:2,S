The EHEA_PAGESIZE define is needed for queue management to hardware side.

The eHEA chip is not PCI attached but directly connected to a proprietary
bus. Currently, we can access it by a simple 64 bit address, but this is not
true in all cases. Having a struct here allows us to encapsulate the chip
register access and to respond to changes to system hardware.
We'll change the name to h_epa meaning "ehea physical address"
