  What kernel version do you have? In 2.2 kernels this number is 1024 and is configurable
from /proc/sys/fs/dquot-max so I guess you have some 2.0 kernel.. In that one
rising the number should help but quota in 2.0 is a bit buggy and so if it won't help, you
can try my fixes to 2.0.35/36. They are on 
ftp://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/pub/local/jack/quota-fix-2.0.35-2.diff.gz.
