Subject: [Semi-OT,important] ORBS globally blocks users of these lists
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/1/16/94

This mail is not directly related to these lists, but is very important.
ORBS is now blocking globally.  In some cases they are blocking entire
countries by way of that country's address space provider.
ORBS is -damaging- email communication by killing the entire body rather
than clipping the fingernail.
To my knowledge, the following sites are affected.  All above.net address
space customers including but not limited to; Linux.com, Themes.org,
Sourceforge.net, Stampede.org, Bugtraq, all rr.com customers, and thousands
upon thousands more.
Above.net address space and rr.com address space is blacklisted because they
refuse to allow ORBS to scan them for open relays and other spam allowing
problems.
Please do -not- use ORBS in the vger lists.  The less than one thousandth of
one percent of systems allowing spam through them is much more desired than
the 100% block.
Unfortunately, most people in these domains and address space are finding it
difficult to get the word out because their mail is being blocked.
Please do -not- use or support ORBS with their current global blacklist
policies.
