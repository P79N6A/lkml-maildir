hi, just compiled 2.2.10-ac11 this morning and found out that the
networking is not functioning.
A quick look at the boot msg confirm that the interface had been initialize
without problems and there are no extra-ordinary errors in the log
messages. The network is ok if switch back to 2.2.10 vanilla . ( never try
2.2.10 ac10 before )
my system is a 166 mmx running web, nfs and samba services.
my network card is vortex ( 3 com 3c59x ).
hopes this helps
