Subject: keyboard ONLY functions in 2.5.27 with local APIC on for UP

Vojtech, list,
I find that my keyboard only works if I turn on the local APIC on UP on my
laptop. The only clue I see scrolling past is something about 'AT keyboard
timeout, not present?'. I don't have my nullmodem cable handy to check it
out further.
I do see it talking about interrupt 1 and IO 0x60. I've also compiled it
with the SERIO debugging setting and ATKBD debugging on, but I still don't
see anything useful.
Every once in a while it would say 'unknown scancode from keybord set 0,
0x2' and then some more numbers. I feel bad that I can't be anymore specific
right now.
If you want me to do some more checking, let me know, and I'll hook up the
serial.
Regards,
bert
