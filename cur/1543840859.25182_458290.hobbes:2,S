Old udev. That one is the latest in fc3. The latest udev is 098, in rawhide 
there is 095.
Old hal. The latest is 0.5.7.1, in rawhide there is also that version.
Redhat doesn't seem to support old releases too much (fc3 in this case), try to 
upgrade to fc6 test or fc5, or at least
yum --enablerepo=development update hal udev
or something like that.
