Err, I wouldn't go that far.  In particular, error handling in the
case of I/O errors, out-of-memory errors, etc. may not work completely
correctly with ext3-0.0.7a.
It would be possible to try to backport a more recent version of ext3
to the 2.2 kernel, but it would probably be less work to forward port
the necessary drivers, etc. for the Playstation 2 to 2.4 or 2.5.....
