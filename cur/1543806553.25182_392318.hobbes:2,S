Once we've gone to the trouble of deciding which tasks to move and how
many (and the estimate should be very conservative), and locked the source
and destination runqueues, it is a very good idea to follow up with our
threat of actually moving the tasks rather than bail out early.
It is quite likely (though perhaps less so in this braindead benchmark)
that a subsequent load balance operation will need to move the remaining
tasks anyway, so decreasing the efficiency of this routine is going to cause
more damage to your RT task even if you "fix" it to not actually show up as
a single latency blip.

I don't think we need to change it in the mainline kernel just yet. At least
not something that will bail after moving just a single task every time in
the worst case.

That's a long way off (if ever) if you want to run crazy code that simply
increases some resource loading until something breaks. Take an rwsem for
writing and then queue up thousands of readers on the lock. Release the
writer. (this will be very similar to run queue balancing, in effect).
