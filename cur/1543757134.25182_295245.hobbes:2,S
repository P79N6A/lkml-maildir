Hi !
Not yet no. This one uses a new chip called the "SMU" that replace both
the old PMU (power management) and the FCU (fan control unit). I don't
know yet how to operate it to drive the fans, there is no open source
darwin driver for it and no infos available from Apple  :(
Hopefully, I'll get an iMac G5 soon, which has a similar chip, so I'll
be able to do some reverse engineering and eventually figure it out.
Ben.
