It might be worth looking at:
http://www.rpsys.net/openzaurus/patches/sharpsl_pm-r8.patch
This is a more general and much cleaned up version of the Sharp power

http://www.rpsys.net/openzaurus/patches/spitz_pm-r3.patch
http://www.rpsys.net/openzaurus/patches/corgi_pm-r3.patch
I'm still cleaning this up but its getting there...
