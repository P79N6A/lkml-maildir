It's about bundling. It's about being able to take your 3-year old 
dependable car and make it faster by bolting on new manifolds and 
turbochargers, rather than waiting a year for the manufacturer to release 
a totally new model (and buying totally new cars often means you're part 
of the manufacturer's debugging group, so be prepared to have things fail 
which require warranty work).
Now, granted, I really do agree with you about the whole code sharing 
thing. A fresh start is often just what you need. I'm just questioning if 
it wouldn't be better to do this fresh start immediately after going 
48-bit, rather than before. That way, existing users that want that extra 
umph can have it today.
