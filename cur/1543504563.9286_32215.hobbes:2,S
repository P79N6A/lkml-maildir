MVS is preemptable, in addition 90% of the MVS "kernel" is pageable.
It allows both by the heavy use of spin and sleep locks, avoiding
deadlocks at the expense of a specific hierarchy of locks.  For
example, to do anything to virtual storage tables, you must own the
VSM lock and to obtain the VSM lock, you are not allowed to already own
any locks lower in the hierarchy than VSM.  Pretty standard deadlock
avoidance algorithm.
So it is possible to have a real and complex OS that is preemptable and
pageable.  Although I have to say that the MVS internals to support
kernel preemption and paging are a lot more complex than the current
Linux internals.
