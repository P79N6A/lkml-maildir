Hi,
when my driver does an invalid memory access I get an oops, and
the systems continues.
I would like the system to panic in this case.
Is this possible?
(After looking around in the source I think it's not possible
without a source change. Is there a reason this isn't a config
option or is my idea too exotic?)
regards,
chris
