hmmm ... when i built mine, i didn't get that message until doing:
sudo make modules_install
... it went through the process of installing the modules, and then - 
the very last line - it gave me:
> : undefined reference to `there_is_no_init_MUTEX_LOCKED_for_RT_semaphores' 
and it also gave me the same deal when doing:
sudo make install.
so, unless it compiled all the drivers/modules *before* exiting with 
error, i would try to find out the driver/module that is failing to 
compile, assess whether you need it or not, and try again (using "make 
gconfig").
