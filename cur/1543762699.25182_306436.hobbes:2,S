I know it does. The thing is that you have *two* chances to get a branch
mispredict now.
Now if kfree did NOT do the if but move it always to the caller, then
you have somewhat different dynamics (since you then always if the
conditional jump once no matter) but that is not the case.

note that to gain from teh branch predictor "more often than not"
probably needs to be in the 20:1 ratio to actually gain.
