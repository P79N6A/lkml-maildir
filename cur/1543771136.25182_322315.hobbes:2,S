Perhaps you didn't follow the story of RTAI, RTAI nanokernel adeos
etc..etc.. has all been implemented to workaround that US patent. So to
me redefining cli in any way has always been a no-way. Originally RTAI
users were infringing and they've been forced to switch to nanokernel
AFIK.
In US patents exists, if you've a problem with that it's sure not me
that you should talk with. I'd be very happy not having to come up with
nontechnical topics.

You also got closer to learn how and why RT has developed in linux
the way it did.
The main confusion come from the fact your patch is obviously covered by
the patent since you're redefinining cli, while I assumed it wasn't.
