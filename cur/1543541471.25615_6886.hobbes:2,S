#   This is why to deal with that kind of data it should be opened as forks
# only -- this can't be made backward-compatible.
The point of the forks was to supply additional optional (and
discardable) information that should be associated with a file. You're
talking about fully-fledged structured storage, which *will* break
backwards compatibility, and is something quite different, really
(although the very basic principles are the same).
