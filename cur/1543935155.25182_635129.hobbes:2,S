Hi all,
I redesigned all files for microblaze cpu (xilinx fpga).
All code is FDT compatible.
I would like to ask you what is the best way to push these changes to 
kernel.org.
I would like to know step by step how to do.
I have some question about.
I have changes in my internal git repository. I don't have public git 
repository.
Is it possible to create git repository in git.kernel.org for Microblaze 
cpu?
What are maintainers responsibilities? Do you have any page about?
I am  U-BOOT maintainer at denx.de and I hope that the responsibilities 
will be similar.
How many maintainers are acceptable? (one or more)
I checked whole code with checkpatch.pl script to avoid code violations. 
I hope I resolve the most of coding style problems.
I see the right way to push all changes to public git repository and 
then send patches in small logical group to LKML with CC to people from 
microblaze community.
And then wait for comments from you, solve problems, update git 
repository and send changes again.
Thanks for your comments.
Cheers,
Michal Simek
