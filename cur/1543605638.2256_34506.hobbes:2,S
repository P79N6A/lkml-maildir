I've tried using a Sedlbauer speedcard ISDN controller under Alpha
RH6.2.
This works fine with a single processor kernel, but the module fails to
load with a kernel compiled for SMP.
I gather this is true for all the Isdn4Linux drivers, though as I have a
three processor machine, this is a real pain !
Advice seems to be to get an external TA of some kind, but that would
seem likely to add to ping times, and maybe to create a bottleneck if I
ever get 128k or compression to my ISP !
So, two questions:
  1) are there any fixes for this problem in the pipeline
and if not,
  2) how easy would it be for the kernel novice to adapt a uniprocessor
     driver to survive in the SMP environment ?
Cheers, J/.
