Subject: clock skew when writing cd (ide-scsi)

I did check google on this but so far I didn't find a reason or fix yet.
using 2.4.18 (or previous), I always see on both my older BP6 as well as
the current system that there is a clock skew.
if I burn 6 or 7 cd's the total system time is approx one hour behind.
there are no messages in the logs that could hint me what the problem
is.
anyone an idea ?
