Subject: [PATCH] Fix CONFIG_COMPAT_BRK help text
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

CONFIG_COMPAT_BRK=y means that heap randomization is turned off, so
it's *always* a safe choice.  I assume the help text is trying to say
that if one does not run ancient binaries, then enabling heap
randomization is safe.
