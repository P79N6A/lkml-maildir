I went ahead and created a patch series and attributed Adrian
for the patches of his I liked.  There were a couple that
I tweaked.  Wasn't sure if all the hunks would apply nicely
after that if we mixed and matched his and mine, hence the series.
Hope that's okay.  Should I have gotten his ack for the ones
I rewrote?  The fixes were pretty small so I figured they didn't
really need more review.
The patch series is on the way...
