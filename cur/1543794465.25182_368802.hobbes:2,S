This is verified by adding printks to the code.  This is exactly  
where it crashes.

With heavy printk debugging, I have identified that the hwif->mmio is  
getting set to 2 somewhere (even though the PDC driver never touches  
it).  I added an extra line in the PDC init code to explicitly zero  
hwif->mmio, but I get the same result, so something else is mashing  
on the PDC hwif.

This is the only possibility that I can think of, but I'm having a  
hard time getting enough lines of pre-BUG output.  Is there any way  
to turn off the BUG() lines and just show the printks before that point?
