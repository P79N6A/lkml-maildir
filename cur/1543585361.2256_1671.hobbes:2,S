No, because the bitmaps are not updated synchronously.  It would be exactly
the same as today, but without the lock contention.  Also, for very large
filesystems, you get into the case where it is spread across multiple
physical disks, so they _can_ be doing I/O in parallel.

It really depends on what you are using for a benchmark.  Ext2 likes to
spread directories evenly across the groups, so if you are creating files
in separate directories, then you only have 1/number_of_groups chance
that they would be contending for the same group lock.  If the files are
being created in the same directory, then you have other locking issues
like updating the directory file itself.

Well, the numbers in the superblock are what's used for statfs, and will
also to determine if the fs is full.  It would be safe enough to have an
ext2 function call which "gathers" all of the lazy updates into the SB
for use by statfs and such.  For the case of a full filesystem, the block
allocation routines would eventually find this out anyways, once they
search all of the groups and don't find a free block, so no harm done.  I
believe that sync_supers() is called by kupdated every 5 seconds, so
this would be a good time to collect the deltas to the superblock.
Cheers, Andreas
