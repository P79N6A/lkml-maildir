Correct. We should use the warnings to tell us that there may be something
fishy here and fix it all.
I've used checkpatch in the same way occasionally. If I had to do some
cleanup and checkpatch was a bit noisy I went through the file
_manually_. And when finished I ran chackpatch again and fixed up the
warnings/errors that made sense for me to fix and that I forgot when I refactored
the code.
So when I see "capability.h: extern's make no sense in userspace"
the perfect approach would be that the whole file was checked.
This is a much bigger task that just removing the warning.
(All this said I have sometimes doen the "remove warnings only trick too").
