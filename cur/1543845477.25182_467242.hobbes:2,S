Hmm.. Ok, I can see that. Thanks for the clarification.

Right off, it seems it would then make sense to make the ntp "ticks" one
second in length. And set the interval values accordingly.
However, there might be clocksources that are incapable of running
freely for a full second w/o overflowing. In that case we would need to
set the interval values and the ntp tick length accordingly. It seems we
need some sort of interface to ntp to define that base tick length.
Would that be ok by you?
thanks
