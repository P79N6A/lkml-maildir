It's there in the DEVICE environment variable.  See
http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net/?selected=usb
 for more
documentation.
So a simple /sbin/hotplug script of:
	#!/bin/sh
	if [ "$1" == "usb" ]; then
		chmod 666 $DEVICE
	fi
would work just fine for your needs.

It's not a procfs hack, it is a stand alone filesystem.  The fact that
you happen to mount it within the /proc filesystem is your option.
The USB developers did not want to force people to use devfs to use USB
devices, and based on the fact that not a single distro is using devfs
(the one that did, now recommends that you disable it) backs up this
choice.

See the numerous lkml posts about why this is so.
