as far as the prioritization of function calls goes, _that_ makes sense, 
but it should not be a separate API but should be done to our normal 
workqueue APIs. That not only extends the effects of priorities to all 
current workqueue using kernel subsystems, but also keeps the API more 
unified. We really dont want to have too many -rt specific APIs.
