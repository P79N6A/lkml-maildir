Several, but none on laptops or other stuff that runs Linux.  That behaviour
is not common on indicator LEDs.  I have seen standby LEDs on laptops which
"blink" by slowly fading from full to off, and then back to full, though.

Sure, it is perfectly possible.  I am not sure it is *desireable*, though.
The way we have triggers work make what you describe impossible right now,
the software triggers are LED_OFF:LED_FULL, not LED_OFF:old-brightness.
And so are the common hardware triggers on laptops, for that matter.
If we go and fix every trigger to use the current brightness (as long as it
is non-zero) as the "turn LED on" trigger event, then the documentation has
to be changed accordingly to do what you said above, and we would stop the
trigger only by setting brightness to zero or by explicitly removing it.
I don't think it is worth the hassle, though.  But we better decide that
*now*, because all this changing of the LED class ABI (even if it is, IMHO,
a big improvement) is not a good idea.  We better do it all during the
2.6.25 cycle.
