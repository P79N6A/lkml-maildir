I didn't try it on a 64bit kernel. I'll do as soon as I can reach my
machine. Probably the loop does not find PT_PHDR and then returns noexec.
I had such a problem, but it was because I forgot elf_ppnt = elf_phdata
before the loop.
By the way, is init 32 bits or 64 bits? It could break the ia32
emulation thing, but not the 64bit native mode.
Anyway the problem could be addressed by returning back to the old
behaviour if the loop fails, but it's not clean at all.
