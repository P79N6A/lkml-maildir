I wondered the same, until I noticed: 
 #if defined(WANT_PAGE_VIRTUAL) 
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        void *virtual;                  /* Kernel virtual address  (NULL if
                                           not kmapped, ie. highmem) */
 #endif /* CONFIG_HIGMEM || WANT_PAGE_VIRTUAL */
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
the #defined check is on WANT_PAGE_VIRTUAL only - the script tripped
over CONFIG_HIGMEM, which is in the #endif only.
