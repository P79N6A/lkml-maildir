The "more or less" is what bothers me here - the first time I heard this,
it sounded a little misleading, as I expected to find some kind of a
patch to ext3 to make it 64 bit with extents and cluster support.
Now I understand it a little better (thanks to Joel and Mark)
And herein lies the issue where I tend to agree with Andrew on
-- its really nice to have multiple filesystems innovating freely in
their niches and eventually proving themselves in practice, without
being bogged down by legacy etc. But at the same time, is there enough
thought and discussion about where the fragmentation/diversification is really
warranted, vs improving what is already there, or say incorporating
the best of one into another, maybe over a period of time ?
The number of filesystems seems to just keep growing, and supporting
all of them isn't easy -- for users it isn't really easy to switch from
one to another, and the justifications for choosing between them is
sometimes confusing and burdensome from an administrator standpoint
- one filesystem is good in certain conditions, another in others,
stability levels may vary etc, and its not always possible to predict
which aspect to prioritize.
Now, with filesystems that have been around in production for a long
time, the on-disk format becomes a major constraining factor, and the
reason for having various legacy support around. Likewise, for some
special purpose filesystems there really is a niche usage. But for new
and sufficiently general purpose filesystems, with new on-disk structure,
isn't it worth thinking this through and trying to get it right ? 
Yeah, it is a lot of work upfront ... but with double the people working
on something, it just might get much better than what they individually
can. Sometimes.
BTW, I don't know if it is worth it in this particular case, but just
something that worries me in general.

True, but what usually ends up happening is that this question can
never quite be answered in black and white. So both just continue
to exist and apps need to support both ... convergence becomes impossible
and long term duplication inevitable.
So at least having a clear demarcation/guideline of what situations
each is suitable for upfront would be a good thing. That might also
get some cross ocfs-gfs and ocfs-ext3 reviews in the process :)
