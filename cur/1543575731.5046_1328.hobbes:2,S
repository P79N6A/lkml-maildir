The latest version is always available at 
http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/kbuild/
Release 0.9.0: Wed Dec 13 01:30:21 EST 2000
	* Now uses Python 2.0 (this cuts down the code size significantly).
	* Synchronized with 2.4.0-test12.
Using Python 2.0 rather than 1.5.2 lets me cut close to 600 lines out of the
CML2 system, a bit more than 10% of the 5334 lines of code in this version.
This code is ready to be used for production.
For those of you who may be new since the last release, CML2 is a
drop-in replacement for the existing make config/menuconfig/xconfig
machinery that has been endorsed by the current kbuild maintainers.
It is smaller, *much* cleaner, and includes powerful new features 
including automatic deduction of correct side-effects whenever you
change a configuration symbol.  Details at the project page given above.
