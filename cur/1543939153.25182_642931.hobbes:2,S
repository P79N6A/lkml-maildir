My understanding is that it will fault immediately if there's a TLB 
entry, and rewalk the tables on return from the fault before restarting 
the instruction, so there's no need for an explicit TLB flush.  The TLB 
doesn't have a notion of negative cache entries, so any entry represents 
a present page of some variety.
