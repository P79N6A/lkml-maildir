Well, I must say I second that.
I'm not seeing regressions myself this time (well, except for the one that
Jiri fixed), but I did find a few of them during the post-2.6.24 merge window
and I wouldn't like to repeat that experience, so to speak.
IMO, the merge window is way too short for actually testing anything.  I rebuild
the kernel once or even twice a day and there's no way I can really test it.
I can only check if it breaks right away.  And if it does, there's no time to
find out what broke it before the next few hundreds of commits land on top of
that.
Thanks,
Rafael
