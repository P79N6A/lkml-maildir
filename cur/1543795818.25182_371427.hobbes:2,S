No i think they tried to work around the fact that
it's not synchronized on AMD systems - in particular
it drifts slightly even on single socket dual core
A64 X2s and disabling C1 works around that.
But idle=poll is too big an hammer for this. Vojtech
is working on a solution anyways that should address this
better.

In this case it's already C1 that's the problem,
so that won't help them.

We're mostly addressing it - there are problems left, but
overall it's looking good. The remaining problem is 
an education issue of users to not use RDTSC directly, 
but use gettimeofday/clock_gettime
One remaining use is measurements, but for that it is
already dubious (e.g. due to ticking at a possible
different frequency than the CPU). For that I want
to establish the RDPMC 0 convention.
Probably need better documentation for all of this though...

It's an ancient hack for an ancient machine chipset bug, but AFAIK 
not used/needed on anything modern. 
Should probably remove it from x86-64 too.
