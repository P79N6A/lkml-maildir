I tried. The "!@#(*$%^~!" IT/Legal Department(s) don't have a clue.
I asked the "mail-filter" guy on linux-kernel if he could just
exclude everything after a "." in the first column, just like
/bin/mail and, for that matter, sendmail. I was just told that
"It doesn't...." even though I can run sendmail by hand, using
telnet port 25, over the network, and know that the "." in the
first column is the way it knows the end-of-message after it
receives the "DATA" command.
Hoping that somebody, sometime, will implement my suggestion,
I continue to put a dot in the first column after my signature.
I know that if I send my mail around the lab without going through
the "*(_!@#&%" MicroWorm mail-grinder, the dot gets rid of
everything thereafter.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
