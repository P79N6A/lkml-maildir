Last time I was faced with this problem, I nfs mounted the kernel
subtree to the system I wanted them on, compiled the kernel on the
machine it was local to with the command...
 Q> make dep clean modules zImage
...then went to the target machine and did the following...
 Q> make modules_install
 Q> cp arch/i386/boot/zImage /boot/vmlinuz-new
...and finally edited /etc/lilo.conf on that system to allow booting
from /boot/vmlinuz-new which I then tested before renaming it to be
the default boot kernel.
Best wishes from Riley.
