Please note that the rcu_pending() interface was never intended for
external use -- it is purely internal to the RCU infrastructure.
If there is a new external use for rcu_pending(), then it would need to
be documented.  But I would rather this one stay internal -- different
RCU implementations might need different things.
So, what are we trying to do here?

The reason for rcu_pending() was that it is a private interface.
