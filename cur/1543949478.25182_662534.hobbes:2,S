This reminds me a previous attempt of removing SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/christoph/patch-archive/2007/2.6.21-rc6/remove_hwcache_align
At that time Christoph didnt took into account the CONFIG_SMP thing 
(false sharing avoidance), but also that L1_CACHE_SIZE is a compile 
constant, that can differs with cache_line_size()
