I haven't actually provided any figures - it's knowledge passed down
from those that know more about it that I do.
If you want figures about the impact of large I/Os, then we should
not be looking at the HBAs but at the impact on RAID controller
throughput (this I do have numbers on ;). It is not uncommon to
see 2MB I/Os give twice the throughput of 512K I/Os to a single
RAID controller - larger than 512k can only be acheived on systems
with a page size larger than 4k.....

Never did - I'm pointing out that linux can't use all the
capabilities they have.
Cheers,
