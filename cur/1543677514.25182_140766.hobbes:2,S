 Same thing.

 If I boot without the card, I don't seem to be able to get any
 packets out at all, but if I boot with the card inserted, the
 driver loads normally and I can get the interface up. Still, if
 I remove it and reinsert few times, crash happens. 
 Looks like I now get repeatedly the oops when removing the
 card for the second time.

 lspci segfaults after the oops.
 dmesg.out and dmes.out.ksymoops have the latest oops.
