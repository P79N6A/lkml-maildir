you have to quantify what sort of hardware you're benchmarking in either 
case and how its configured before you can reasonably conclude to much... 
I spent quite a bit of time benchmarking filers and linux configurations 
recently and while I can say with some certainty that while netapp makes 
some very fast and well balanced filers they don't by any means have a 
lock on building a high-performance nfs box.

In actually using sfs97r1 published benchmarks to compare to hardware I 
was benchmarking (from emc, netapp and several roll-your own linux boxes) 
I found the published benchmark information alsmost entirely useless given 
that vendors tend to provide wildly silly hardware configurations. In the 
case of the openpower 720 (to use that for an example) the benchmarked 
machine has 70 15k rpm disks spread across 12 fibre channel controllers, 
64GB of ram, 12GB of nvram and 7 network interfaces...
