Please excuse my short-sightedness, but I think the following points
haven't been thought deeply enough:
- modules which use their parameters on initialisation only once.
  (eg, 3c59x "full_duplex" parameter)
- Also, what about module parameters which modules aren't expecting to
  change beneath themselves? (eg, all the watchdog modules)
- Are we opening the floodgates for another round of races and driver
  updates?
