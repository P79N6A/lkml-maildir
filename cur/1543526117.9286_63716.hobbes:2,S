I'm not talking about the ioctl() when I say "setup".
I'm talking about the "mknod".

Sure it does. It makes it an issue of being able to use standard tools
like "ls" or do things like
	if [ -f /proc/drivers/microcode ]; then
	  ...
in startup scripts.
I absolutely _detest_ people who think it's ok to have specialized
applications for things like this. That's another reason I hate sysctl: I
think it's against the whole philosophy of UNIX. Remember, the UNIX way is
"everything is a process or a file, and you can string many small things
together to create a bigger thing".
You _should_ be able to do something like this
	if [ -f /proc/drivers/microcode ]; then
		dd if=microcodefile of=/proc/drivers/microcode bs=500 count=1
	fi
and having to have special tools is not a good feature.
