So talking with more with James and Martin, the correct fix looks to be
Bill's suggestion of using Lowest Priority instead of Fixed for the
destination mode. 
James still claims CPU_MASK_ALL (0xff) is wrong for target_cpus(), but
I'll let him make his case for that.
After some testing, I'll resend the corrected patch.
