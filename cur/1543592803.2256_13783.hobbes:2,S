*shrug*  Well, if you want to go against the kernel standard that's fine
with me.  I won't put Andrzej's changes to your drivers upstream.  You
are going to continually see patches to clean that up, though, because
it makes the end user's kernel smaller.  Please consider noting this
special case in a comment in each of your drivers "do not clean up
static initializers" or similar.
It's really a pain in the ass to remember special cases like this, so
please reconsider.  Being not-like-the-others is detrimental to the long
term maintainability of the overall kernel.
Regards,
	Jeff
