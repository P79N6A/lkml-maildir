Subject: [PATCH 0/2][RFC] VFCIPI v3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/31/228

Changelog from v2:
1) Converted "smp_call_funtion[_single]__nodelay" to
   "raw_smp_call_function[_single]" to match existing nomenclature in the -rt
   series.
2) Removed all PI related code from Patch #1 and moved it to #2 where it
   belonged.
