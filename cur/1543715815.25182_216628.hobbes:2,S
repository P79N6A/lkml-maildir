Excuse me?  The damn thing had found nothing.  However, it didn't care
to release the devices it had claimed - hadn't even closed them, as the
matter of fact.  That's a clear and obvious bug, regardless of any
disagreements.
Speaking of the proposed "solutions", how about #4: figure out what,
when and for how long do they really want to claim and take care to
release what they don't end up using?
WTF is going on there?
