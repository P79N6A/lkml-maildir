No, don't remove this!
Yes, it's a big switch, but what do you propose otherwise?  SELinux
would need a _lot_ of different security calls, which would be fine, but
we don't want to force every security module to try to go through the
process of getting their own syscalls.
And other subsystems in the kernel do the same thing with their syscall,
like networking, so there is a past history of this usage.
Linus, please do not apply.
