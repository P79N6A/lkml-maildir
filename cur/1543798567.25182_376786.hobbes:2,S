PG_reserved no longer does anything (except catching bugs in old code).
If you are writing new code, you shouldn't use it. Don't copy rvmalloc,
you should be able to use vmalloc directly.
vm_insert_page is indeed the right interface for mapping these pages
into userspace.
You do not have to worry about pages being swapped out, and you shouldn't
need to set any unusual vma or page flags. kswapd only walks the lru lists,
and it won't even look at any other pages.
Good luck,
Nick
