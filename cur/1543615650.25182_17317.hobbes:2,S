Well, it turns out that klogd was the culprit.  We were booting a ramdisk,
setting the time, starting syslog, and then setting the timezone from an
NFS-mounted file.  klogd checks the timezone on startup only, so changing the
timezone did not affect the output of klogd.  Guess we'll have to restart syslog
after setting the timezone.
Thanks to those who responded.
