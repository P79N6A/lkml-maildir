The problem appears to get worse;

25 lost packets :(
Also, just to clarify (i wasn't clear earlier), this host is connected
via 1000Mbps full-duplex fibre to the switch.
The other machines on the switch are connected either by 100Mbps copper
or 10Mpbs copper. I'm guessing the other machines shouldn't be able to
flood the RX on this host even if they all transmitted at the same time?
(there are only three of them)
