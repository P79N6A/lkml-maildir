Hi,
I have a piece of code which uses environment variables. I have been
told that it is not going to work in kernel space because the concept
of environment is not applicable inside the kernel.
I belive that, but I need to demonstrate it. I do not know how to
proof this, perhaps referring to a solid reference about Linux design
that points to the idea that it has no sense to use environment
variables in kernel space.
Do anyone knows about the existence of such document?
Thank you,
