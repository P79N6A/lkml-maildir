I don't think that rt_sched_class :: dequeue_task_rt() is in any of
such "fast pathes" that we should really care about an additional
math. operation.
If this approach is ok, logically-wise (no side effects from a short
'delta_exec', esp. on RT -> NORMAL).. I think it's better as it keeps
the 'sched_class' interface simpler.

rt_sched_class :: put_prev_task() from __setscheduler() ? But it's not
supposed to be called from here, logically-wise. You just rely on its
current behavior (which is only about updating 'exec_start' and
'exec_sum') -- that's just bad. Maybe I misunderatood your intention
though..
