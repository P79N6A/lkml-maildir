Subject: Strange asm warning from bsetupt.s in 2.5.3-pre5

I've just finished to compile 2.5.3-pre5 and I noticed
the following  strange warning from as(1):
	as -o bsetup.o bsetup.s
	bsetup.s: Assembler messages:
	bsetup.s:1180: Warning: Value 0x37ffffff truncated to 0x37ffffff.
					  ~~~~~~		  ~~~~~~
It's comming from the small change introduced in setup.S:
	ramdisk_max:  .long __MAXMEM-1        # (Header version 0x0203 or later)
FYI as(1) version is:
	as --version
	GNU assembler 2.11.90.0.19
Cheers
