Why do you need this? Why encrypting fs is not enough?

It depends on the data and on the metadata. Of course we can use 
compression and hashing (already discussed on this list in dm-crypt 
thread) to make data more protected. But, at fs level, we can encrypt 
metadata with different key (for metadata or part of metadata only) and 
this way keep it still near the data (this helps performance by reducing 
expensive disk seeks) but encrypted "differently".

But why do you want to make attacker life easier? With fs level encryption 
we can hide the offsets in secure way, encrypt both data and metadata (but 
differently).

But it will not help performance.

Well, changing some parts of VFS and maybe MM we can make encryption and 
compression easier to implement for various fs developers. Maybe we can 
add some generic "messing with the data and metadata" (compressing, 
encrypting, etc.) hooks to VFS?
I think that generic solution is best, but compression on block level is 
very hard to implement. Remember you must keep block size the same 
(because majority of fs will work only with 512, 1024, ... block sizes) 
while still keeping your additional compression data near the compressed data 
(for disk seek performance reasons). And you will not gain any size 
effects from this type of compression (building not constant block size 
device is horrible, and you must probably change significant amount of 
kernel to do that; think about fragmentation also). And compression is cpu 
consumming process (I think you cannot implement Huffman in O(n) time, 
probably someting like O(nlogn) with not very small constant is required). 
And if you want just make your data harder to decrypt or to analyse its 
encrypted form you can use some O(n) simple algorithms designed for this 
purpose (some were discussed on this list in dm-crypt thread).
But feel free to try :-)
