This is what happens:
 - we start inserting new item into balanced tree,
 - lock nodes on the leaf level and modify them
 - go to the parent level
 - lock nodes on the parent level and modify them. This may require
   allocating new nodes. If allocation fails---we have to panic, because
   tree is in inconsistent state and there is no roll-back; if allocation
   hangs forever---deadlock is on its way, because we are still keeping
   locks on nodes on the leaf level.

At the time I tested it, it panicked after getting NULL from
__alloc_pages(). With current `do_retry' logic in __alloc_pages() it
will deadlock, I guess.

Worst-case behavior of tree algorithms is well-known. Yes it's overkill.
