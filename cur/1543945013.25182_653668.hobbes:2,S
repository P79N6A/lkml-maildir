Hello,
whom should I blame about disk schedulers?
I have the following setup:
1Gb network
2GB RAM
disk write speed about 20MB/s
If I'm scping file (about 500MB) from the network (which is faster than the
local disk), any process is totally unable to read anything from the local disk
till the scp finishes. It is not caused by low free memory, while scping
I have 500MB of free memory (not cached or buffered).
I tried cfq and anticipatory scheduler, none is different.
