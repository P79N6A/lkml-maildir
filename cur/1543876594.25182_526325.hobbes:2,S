In __oom_kill_task(), there is a comment that says,
"We give our sacrificial lamb high priority and access to all the memory 
it needs. That way it should be able to exit() and clear out its 
resources quickly..."
However, we don't actually change the priority at that point, we just 
give it a large timeslice.
Would it make sense to actually change the priority/policy using 
sched_setscheduler() to give the process a deeply negative nice level or 
maybe even make it realtime?
This seems to help on some of our OOM stress tests.
