Hmm, I wrote these 2 simple prgms:
//********** 1 ***
void foo(){
  char a[16384];
  foo();
}
void main(){
  foo();
}
//********** 2 ***
void main(){
void *i;
  while(1) i=malloc(16384);
}
Program #1 ends with a huge core dump.
Program #2 ends with a core too, but it is very little, about 8MB. 
Strange.
Anyway the machine is still OK and prefectily working and stable. You 
should
post the peice of code that cause you that troubles...
[PowerPC 640e 200MHz
 64MB ram
 90MB swap
 HD SCSI Quantum 3GB
 kernel v2.2.9]
Bye.
