Never heard of fxload before. I just tried it by moving the firmware
directory out of the way so that hotplug wouldn't try to initialize the
device behind my back.
    # fxload -v -t fx -D /proc/bus/usb/002/011 -I keyspan-usa19qi.fw

Looks like it works, so I guess the pre-numeration stuff in the driver
is really not necessary. We just need a bunch of hotplug rules to load
the correct firmware whenever an uninitialized device is plugged in and
some way to distribute the firmware images.
