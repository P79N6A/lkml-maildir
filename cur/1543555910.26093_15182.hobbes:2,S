One thing... the "thwarted by cache" comment probably isn't very
useful.  As far as I know the only machines which have the cache
problem are i386 boxen, but the i386 doesn't have WBINVD.  The i486
has a pin on the CPU for A20, which takes effect inside the L1 cache,
and so it shouldn't have any A20 cache issues.
