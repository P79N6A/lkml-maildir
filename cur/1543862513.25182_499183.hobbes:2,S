Please do not remove isdn4linux just yet. It's true that it has been
marked as obsolete for quite some time, but it's still needed anyway.
Its designated successor, the CAPI subsystem, so far only supports
a very limited range of hardware. Dropping isdn4linux now would leave
the owners of some very popular ISDN cards out in the cold.
Thanks,
Tilman
