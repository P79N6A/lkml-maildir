1) Make a general resource allocation lock, if there is none.
2) make ACPI take this lock whenever it touches ports not allocated by itself
   and release it on function return.
3) Make ACPI callback the allocating device if it touches allocated ranges,
   and on function return.
1 + 2 will replace allocating single ports and freeing them again (so ACPI won't
prevent e.g. the display driver from loading just because it turned on the
backlight) while preventing races with newly allocated ranges, and 3 allows
coexistence with other drivers.

The problem with the easy way out is that it has already been mined.
