That's not your fault, the patch was born using those numbers, even because it 
started from 2.4.

The fix is easy, IMHO, and not even urgent. It suffices to move PTRACE_SYSEMU 
def from <linux/ptrace.h> to <asm-i386/ptrace.h>, and we didn't do that yet 
for laziness only. There's no architecture that I know of, apart i386, which 
implements SYSEMU (except maybe s390, but that isn't public).
