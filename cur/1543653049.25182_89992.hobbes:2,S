Thanks! I will look into it. This is what I was looking for.
I been running this kernel with my copy for three days, and never had
oops, but I was really worried.

It tried both, use just normal mov or movq <-> use movntq + postfetch, and the later 
was much much faster, because postfetch needs to read only every 64 bytes.
I will ckeck kernel_fpu_begin() fisrt and if using fpu register is too much
overhead than I will remove them.
