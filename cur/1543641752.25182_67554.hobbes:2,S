True.
I've been playing a bit with how gcc handles the const qualifiers
and made an interesting discovery:
Trying to compile
typedef int *p_int;
void a(const p_int t) { *t = 0; }
void b(const p_int t) { t = (int *) 0; }
void c(const int *t) { *t = 0; }
void d(const int *t) { t = (int *) 0; }
void e(int const *t) { *t = 0; }
void f(int const *t) { t = (int *) 0; }
will give 'assignment of read-only location' warnings for
b(), c() and e(), i.e. it's impossible to have a constant
pointer to a non-constant value w/o using a qualified
typedef.
W/o a typedef, gcc seems unable to tell the difference
between 'const int *' and 'int const *' altogether. In case
one needs a constant pointer to a constant value, something
like this should do:
typedef const int *p_int;
void f(const p_int a);
Usable? I don't quite think so.
