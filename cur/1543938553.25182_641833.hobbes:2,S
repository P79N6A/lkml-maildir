Hi folks,
If I put some heavy load on the iwl3945, then the network connection
gets stuck after a some time. To fix it I have to reload the module.
AFAICS this problem was a topic on lkml almost 3 months ago. Any news
about this? I would be glad to help to track this down, but I have
no idea how to change the scaling algorithm to iwl-3945-rs .
Regards
Harri
