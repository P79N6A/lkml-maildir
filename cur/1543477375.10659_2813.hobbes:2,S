Userlevel DMA is the only way to go as the IO devices increase the
bandwidth (say, Clustering, Gigabit Ethernet, System Area networking),
and you want to keep the overheads down (ie: avoid going into the
kernel every so often).
The idea is to have the user process register the dma areas it needs
in the kernel (in a table that the dma engine has a pointer to)
and then have the peripheral do a check (in hard/firmware) that the
actual dma block it got is 'within bounds'.
On a PCI-SCI clustering adapter I used to work on in a previous (work)
life, you needed to have ~1-2Kbyte DMA blocks before the DMA engine
was worth using; otherwise just moving the data with the CPU was far
superior.
