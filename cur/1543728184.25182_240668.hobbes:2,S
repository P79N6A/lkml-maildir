I still do not see it... swsusp does not care about logical state of
device. (Actually manipulating logical state of device might make
swsusp less transparent). It cares about device not doing DMA (I also
said "no interrupts", but that is not strictly neccessary: we disable
interrupts for atomic copy. Device should do no NMIs, through).
