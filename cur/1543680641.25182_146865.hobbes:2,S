Hey, this is already much later than it should have been, so it's not as
if this is a huge surprise.

We can sort it out later. Obviously, clearly arm-specific patches (ie
stuff in arch/arm and include/asm-arm) I wouldn't mind per se, but I'd
rather hold back on even those just to make the patches and the changlogs
not be mixed up with the "main bugfixes".
We've never had a first stable release that has all architectures
up-to-date, and I'm not planning on changing that for 2.6.x. This is _not_
the time to try to make my tree build on arm (or other architectures
either), considering that my tree hasn't been the main ARM tree for a long 
time.

To be blunt, which part of "we want to release 2.6.x this year" came as a
surprise to you? I
That means that I'm not willing to hold stuff up any more. Stuff that 
hasn't followed the development tree doesn't magically just "get fixed". 
Also, the only real point of a stable release is for distribution makers.
That pretty much cuts the list of "needs to be supported" down to x86,
ia64, x86-64 and possibly sparc/alpha.
So everything else is a bonus, but can equally well just play catch-up
later. Embedded people tend to want to stay back anyway, which is 
obviously why they don't follow the development tree in the first place.
