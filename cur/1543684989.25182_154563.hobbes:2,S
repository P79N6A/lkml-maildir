Hello Petr,
at this time I can't provide you with details or exact reporting as the box has
to be used for finding the 2.4.22-pre stability problem I see. And since the
crashes take quite some time to occur I cannot reboot and check out what's the
deal with the vmware modules.
And frankly: I find the application quite ok but tainting the kernel with the
closed source modules is really something to think about, especially since
there should be easy ways to avoid that completely.
Btw I already stopped using nvidia equipment completely due to not being able
to produce valuable debugging output while running an nvidia-tainted kernels.
I might come back to your request for details when 2.4.22 got stable.
Regards,
Stephan
