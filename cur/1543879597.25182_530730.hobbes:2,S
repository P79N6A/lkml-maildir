Yes, we do branch off Linus's tree for each of the different .y
releases.
Some people have asked us to keep all of the different .y branches in
the same git tree, but for now we have been using different repositories
on kernel.org to keep things simpler for the majority of people who do
not fully understand how to use the branching features of git (myself
included in that category at times, I've messed up merging to different
branches too many times...)

That's really cool, thanks for pointing out how to do it.
