If there was a link-mode change (100-to-10-base, 1/2 to full duplex) OR
if the chip status overflowed (tx packets, rx, packets, errors, etc) OR
if the transmitter aborted (unplug when active, etc.) THEN
   reset and reprogram the chip (after telling you something wicked
   happened IF verbose debug is enabled). 
You can turn OFF verbose debug (set debug to 1) and you won't have
the message.
