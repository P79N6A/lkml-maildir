Do you have any plans how to store the extents?
* NTFS uses a compressed list of all extents
* Hfs (& Hfs+) stores the first 3 (8) extents in the file record, and it
has one global BTree for all remaining entries, but that serializes the
access to highly fragmented files. (Infact, our Hfs driver for 95 has to
load all fragments in advance to avoid deadlocks).
* BeFS uses a simple list.
Do you think that a linear search is acceptable?
And since we must support the current system for sparse-files, what
about a mixed system (direct, perhaps indirect: extents; the rest:
current system).
