Yes, it's just a fair amount of document-hunting since there isn't
always easily cut-and-pasteable stuff (e.g. ITAG_MASK for larger page
sizes was omitted from the #ifdefs on sparc64).
As for ia64 checking addresses... ew, can't we just use long format
VHPT? The virtual placement constraints are nasty.
