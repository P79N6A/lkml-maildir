Linux is not the reference TCP/IP stack for routers. 8-)

Probably because PMTUD is just a DRAFT STANDARD, and these router
folks are usually extremely conservative.  Switching the default is
dangerous because it's likely to break existing setups, as Herbert
noted.

Indeed.  On those platforms, the CPU impact is also significant, and
the overall increase in BGP convergence time is measurable.
