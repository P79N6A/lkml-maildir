Subject: 2.2.1: fs/buffer.c::fdatasync patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/2/16/22

The following patch implements a semaphore in fsync() that should also
have been propogated to the (identical) fdatasync() function; perhaps
fdatasync() should just call fsync() until fdatasync() is properly
implemented on its own... anyway, here's the fix.
