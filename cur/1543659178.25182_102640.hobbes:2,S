If the main flow of the code is through a bunch of hard to trace
gotos and you choose to blame the tool instead of the programmer,
I guess you could blame goto.
However, the goto can also be a great tool to make the code more
readable.  The goto statement is, IMHO, one of the more elegant
ways to code exceptions into a C function; that is, dealing with
error situations that don't happen very often, in such a way that
the error handling code doesn't clutter up the main code path.
As an example, you could look at fs/super.c::do_kern_mount()
        mnt = alloc_vfsmnt(name);
        if (!mnt)
                goto out;
        sb = type->get_sb(type, flags, name, data);
        if (IS_ERR(sb))
                goto out_mnt;
Do you see how the absence of the error handling cleanup code
makes the normal code path easier to read ?
regards,
Rik
