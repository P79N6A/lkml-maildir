But what's the point of the extra complexity?  People already put
references to other structures in the driver_data element, and
enums, so completely splitting the device IDs from the module
source is not going to be practical.
Are you thinking of a parser which outputs C code for the module to
include?  That might be made to work, but it doesn't sound as elegant
as the solution being described previously in this thread.
