Please permit an observer from the sidelines a few comments.
I think all four of you are right, for different reasons.

s/should/must/ in the above.  That must be a guiding principle.

Since the time between major releases of the kernel seems to be two to 
three years now (counting to where the new kernel is really stable), 
it is probably worthwhile to think about what high-end systems will 
be like when 3.0 is expected.
My guess is that a trend will be machines with increasingly greater cpu
counts with access to the same memory.  Why?  Because if it can be done,
it will be done.  The ability to put more cpus on a single chip may
translate into a Moore's law of increasing cpu counts per machine.  And
as Martin points out, the high end machines are where the money is.
In my own unsophisticated opinion, Larry's concept of Cache Coherent
Clusters seems worth further development.  And Martin is right about the
need for fixing it in the kernel, again IMHO.  But how to fix it in the
kernel?  Would something similar to OpenMosix or OpenSSI in a future
kernel be appropriate to get Larry's CCCluster members to cooperate? Or
is it possible to continue the scalability race when cpu counts get to
256, 512, etc.
Just some thoughts from the sidelines.
Best regards,
Steven
