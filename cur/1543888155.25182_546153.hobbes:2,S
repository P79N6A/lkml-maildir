Oh good.  Perhaps you can just drop the idea entirely and give up?

That's simply not true.  There are other ways of using async scanning
reliably -- as Peter Jones pointed out.  If you're relying on the earlier
semantics of "modprobe returned, therefore scanning is complete", then
yes, it's unreliable.  But if you're using kevents/udev/etc to find out
when devices have been discovered, then it's not unreliable.

I see trimming the CC list as a courtesy to those who've had enough of
this pointless thread landing in their mailboxes.
