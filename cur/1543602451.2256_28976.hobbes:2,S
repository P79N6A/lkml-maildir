Subject: [PATCH] core file naming option
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Alan et. all,
The attached patch adds an option to the build to have core files named
core.processname, but defaulting to the current behaviour of course. 
For most people the single 'core' file is sufficient, but when the sky
is falling, it's nice to have more places for it to land.  :)
So, is this something that might go into the kernel, or are their
philisophical reasons against it?  (The patch is against 2.2.19.  I
haven't looked at 2.4.x yet.  Let me know if you want a 2.4 or if I
should send it to Linus, or...)
Questions, comments, etc. welcome,
Eli
