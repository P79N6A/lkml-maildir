Hello,
I am looking for a way to check from userspace if a given address can be 
dereferenced. One way would be to examine /proc/self/maps if there is 
something mapped and 'r' at the address, but this seems a little time 
consuming. Is there another way? Kernelspace does have it I think, as 
access_ok().
