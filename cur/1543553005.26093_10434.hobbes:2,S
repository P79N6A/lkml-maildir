Actually, you don't have to change every makefile, because you CAN do this
all with a simple backwards-compatibility layer, something like:
	OXONLY = $(filter-out $(O_OBJS), $(OX_OBJS))
	ALL_O = $(OXONLY) $(O_OBJS)
which is a no-op for a "proper" makefile that follows the new rules
(OXONLY will be empty, because all OX_OBJS files will be part of O_OBJS),
but it will make old-style stuff act the same..
I'd actually prefer to just change every Makefile, but hey, I think
something like the above (untested) would make them work unmodified too.
