Yes, I ended up fixing that already (along with handling the fxsave case 
too).

The "init" part is really just "reset_exceptions" - we don't care about
the rest of the state, and the naming is historical (ie it's really called
"init" because "fnsave" does the reset by re-initializing everything, ie 
there's an implied "fninit").
So for the fxsave path, we just use fnclex, since that's faster than a
full fninit.
