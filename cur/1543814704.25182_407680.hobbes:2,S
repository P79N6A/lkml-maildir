Ok the changes in the PCI space are
82C586_1		:	0x70 was 0x22: now 0x42
8235	(South)		:	0x91 was 0x00 now 0x03
862X	(North)		:	0x61 was 2a now ea 0x62 was 00 now 03 0x68
				was 0xD1 now 0xCA 0x81 was 0x61 now 0x69
8235 0x91 is just general purpose timer control
82C586_1 0x70 is an IDE status bit
So the changes that matter are those (or some of those) on the 862X. Which is
the one bit I don't have docs on
