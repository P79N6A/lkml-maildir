Subject: [2.6.6-rc2] ACPI unusable on TP

Hi,
I have ACPI working to a considerable extent in 2.6.5 (I use my own
dsdt). In 2.6.6rc-1/2 and mm1 however, the system refuses to boot. 
There are no messages apart from the 1st "decompressing ..." message,
even with ACPI debug statements on (or pci=noacpi for that matter).
How do I troubleshoot this?
-Niel
PS. I include settings for ACPI and APIC.
