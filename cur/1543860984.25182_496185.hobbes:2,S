Thanks, I need to think about this.
However I am not sure I fully understand the problem.
First, this deadlock was not introduced by recent changes (including "single
threaded flush_workqueue() takes workqueue_mutex too"), yes?
Also, it seems to me we have a much more simple scenario for deadlock.
events/0 runs run_workqueue(), work->func() sleeps or takes a preemtion. CPU 0
dies, keventd thread migrates to another CPU. CPU_DEAD calls kthread_stop() under
workqueue_mutex and waits for until kevents thread exits. Now, if this work (or
another work pending on cwq->worklist) takes workqueue_mutex (for example, does
flush_workqueue) we have a deadlock.
No?
Oleg.
