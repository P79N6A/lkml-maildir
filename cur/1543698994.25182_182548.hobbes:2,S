Well, as for me I don't have GPM around for anything, I have this setup in
X both for 2.4 and 2.6:
        Option          "Device"                "/dev/psaux"
        Option          "Protocol"              "auto-dev"

I had thought something like that some time ago, that I had the problem in
both 2.4 and 2.6, but I only had it reported in 2.6. But testing them I
realised that the behaviour of the mouse is totally different, in 2.6 it
goes mad, while in 2.4 it works perfectly, completely smooth, so I dropped
that idea.
The main difference for my setup of the 2.4 and 2.6 kernels relating mouse
is that on 2.6 I have the Synaptics driver in the kernel and also that in
2.4 I don't have INPUT_* and in 2.6 I have INPUT_MOUSEDEV and INPUT_EVDEV.
I don't know the internals of the drivers here, but I can test whatever you
want, do you think that trying to set this up in 2.6 without Synaptics
support will help us know what is going on? any other test? If so I'll try
them!
If you think about some other tests I can make... just tell me.
Regards...
