	[ This is one of (at least) three different things that

	Why that needs a list of all addresses in the system ?
	Reception can query with standard BSD API what is
	the local address of the socket _at_the_moment_ at
	receiving side.  (  getsockname()  )
	Is there, really, any reason to detect locally anything else ?
	At the receiver all you do is to detect that the IP address
	literal matches the incoming connection, and you strip away
	the literal.
	Of course if the connection is coming in via some NAT box
	somewhere causing your SMTP server to show up with other
	address than what it knows about itself, things get complicated,
	and no matter of what you code into automagic self-address
	detection, you won't get that case solved with it.

	Of course it can be asked for, and ZMailer does it all
	the time when it considers contacting remote servers.
	If IP address of the remote server appears to be any
	of the local ones (or an invalidone), the message gets
	rejected with "a configuration error detected, this
	must be looping"...
