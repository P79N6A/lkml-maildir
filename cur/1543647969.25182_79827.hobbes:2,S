As requested, I changed the defines in this file to :
/*#ifdef CONFIG_USB_DEBUG
#       define DEBUG
#else*/
#       undef DEBUG
/*#endif*/
rebuild a kernel, and started rebooting like mad.
Procedure was following :
1. reboot the computer (software reboot if ok kernel, else reset)
2. go through bios (long initiation with memory testing)
3. when the bootloader shows up (might hang just before, my disks 
really do not like being stopped before reboot) / when the system 
hangs, press reset
4. go through bios initialization (bis)
5. when grub shows up, play a bit in the menus (up-down...) then choose 
a kernel
With this protocol I got a 100% boot rate on the original kernel and an 
almost-always hang with the kernel where debuging was undefed in 
drivers/usb/host/ohci-hcd.c. It did boot two times (out of maybe 10-15 
tries) but that doesn't count since both times the keyboard was dead. 
Since I can't do a lost of things with only the mouse, I clicked reboot 
in gdm these two times.

No such luck. It really looks like ohci is the culprit:(
I guess I'm lucky it's got a maintainer as responsive as you:)
Any other ideas ?
Regards,
P.S.
	I don't know if it's important, but I had to enable usb 
keyboard legacy mode in the bios to have keyboard support in the 
bootloader stage. I had a bad feeling about the option though, a good 
bios is a lean bios.
