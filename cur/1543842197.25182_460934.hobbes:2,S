This chunk seems unrelated to 965 support.

It seems to be a valid fix (as there are indeed 4 entries in
intel_i830_sizes), but I wonder if this was intentional ?
Has this been tested on 915/945?
I've chopped this bit out and committed the rest, we can
add this as a separate commit, which may ease future bisecting
if anything should go awry.
The intel_830_driver struct also lists the num of sizes as '3' btw.
It could just be lots of cut-n-paste braindamage, but things like
this make me nervous in a driver that supports so much hardware
and is so.. twisted.
Also, do we need an entry in agp_intel_resume() for the 965 ?

I'll take a look at those soon.
