   btw. shouldnt it rather be something like: 
   #define log2(x) \
Look at the code just the 'i' in question will output :-)
     mov    inode, %o0
     srlx   %o0, 3, %o4
So on sparc64 atleast, it amounts to "inode >> 3".  So:
(sizeof(struct inode) & ~ (sizeof(struct inode) - 1))
is 8 on sparc64.  The 'i' construct is just meant to get rid of the
"non significant" lower bits of the inode pointer and it does so very
nicely. :-)
