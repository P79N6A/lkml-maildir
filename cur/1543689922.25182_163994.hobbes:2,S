OK, I've updated my patch on top of this.  Mainly cosmetic, please
review.
Name: Minor Tweaks To Jamie Lokier's Futex Patch
Author: Rusty Russell
Status: Booted on 2.6.0-test4-bk9
Depends: Misc/futex-hugh.patch.gz
D: Minor changes to Jamie's excellent futex patch.
D: 1) Remove obsolete comment above hash array decl.
D: 2) Semantics of futex on read-only pages unclear: require write perm.
D: 3) Clarify comment about TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE.
D: 4) Andrew Morton says spurious wakeup is a bug.  Catch it.
D: 5) Use Jenkins hash.
