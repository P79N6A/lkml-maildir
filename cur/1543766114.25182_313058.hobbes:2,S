For some drives, if you are lucky. The problem is that the PLL code in
the hpt366 driver is simply wrong. The -ac tree has some cleanup work in
this area but hasn't fixed the PLL code yet. The vendor driver does
handle this chip correctly.
Linus please avoid this patch - better an oops than disk corruption.
