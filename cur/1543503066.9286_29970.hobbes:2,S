OK. Then let's integrate my solution so that we have at
least _something_ NOW. It has taken almost a year and
my patch has always bounced off on discussions where NO
code for any of the other proposals has shown up.
We can easily add stuff or replace it by something better
later on. For now it's important to have something at
least halfway decent.
