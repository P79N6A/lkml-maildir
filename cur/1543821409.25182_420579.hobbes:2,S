I don't have access to that code (which was closed source anyway).
But it executed C++ code within a few cycles of entering the reset 
vector (no standard BIOS), including but not limited to: programming the 
memory controller (430MX chipset), servicing interrupts, hardware 
accelerated 2D graphics (C&T 65550), IDE driver, simple filesystem, 
simple windowing GUI, network driver (Tulip) etc.
More recently I participated in writing a filesystem in C++. That's in 
userspace, but many of the techniques used in writing kernel code are 
necessary there (extreme robustness, can't assume infinite memory, 
locking, etc.)
There are C++ embedded kernels in 
http://www.zipworld.com.au/~akpm/
 and 
http://ecos.sourceware.org/,
 but I haven't looked at them, so I can't 
say whether I consider them nice or not.
