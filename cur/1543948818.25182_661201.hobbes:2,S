Pavel it is never correct to use a global pid when talking to user space.
In fact the concept is just a bit dubious.  We must always translate
the pid into the pid namespace of the task we are talking to, or at
least into the pid namespace of the process that opened the file
handle, (essentially the same, but does not have races in the corner
cases).
Even in the kernel using global ids is dubious.  When dealing with
user space it is just wrong.  
Speaking of.  I think we still need work on autofs in this regard.
I know last I looked we had some outstanding issues there.
