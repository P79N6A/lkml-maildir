I've read it and not come up with an answer due to some other issues at hand. E1000 
hardware works differently and this has been asked before, but the cards itself are in 
low power state when down. Changing this to bring up the link would make the card start 
to consume lots more power, which would automatically suck enormously for anyone using a 
laptop.
Unfortunately, we have no way to distinguish directly between mobile and non-mobile 
adapters, since they are usually the same.
Your application should really `ifconfig up` the device before checking for link.
Cheers,
Auke
