... and indeed it should.  My apologies - that's a combination of
sparse bug and me being very low on coffee...
FWIW, looks like we are losing address_space in the first form: with current
sparse we get
fs/bio.c:686:15: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different address spaces)
fs/bio.c:686:15:    expected void [noderef] *iov_base<asn:1>
fs/bio.c:686:15:    got void [noderef] *<noident>
from the first form (cast to __user void *).  Lovely...
OK, I think I know what's going on there, will fix.
