In three words, I think this has "too many #ifdefs".
The non-containerized or namespaced case should probably just be one,
static namespace variable that gets wrapped up in some nice #ifdefed
hlper functions.
For instance, instead of this:
+#ifdef CONFIG_IPC_NS
+#define msg_ids                (*(current->ipc_ns->msg_ids))
+#endif
Have 
#ifdef CONFIG_IPC_NS
static inline struct ipc_namespace *current_ipc_ns(void)
{
	return current->ipc_ns;
}
#else
static inline struct ipc_namespace *current_ipc_ns(void)
{
	return &static_ipc_ns;
}
#endif
And use current_ipc_ns()->msg_ids.  I can't imagine that gcc can't
figure that out and turn it back into effectively the same thing.
I really dislike the idea of replacing nice variables with macros that
add indirection.  They really might fool people.  Putting a function
there is much nicer.
Why avoid to passing these things around as function arguments?  Doesn't
that make it more explicit what is going on, and where the indirection
is occurring?  Does it also make refcounting and lifetime issues easier
to manage?
BTW, Did you see my version of this?
