I don't think crippling is the right term, but yes I've been removing
lots of functionality from devfs lately that belongs into different
layers.

I think I already explained this in a mail to Michael with lkml CC'ed..
Please take a look at drivers/base/map.c and fs/char_dev.c in some
recent 2.5 tree.  The map a dev_t to private data functionality has been
moved to common code now, devfs is a very wrong place for this.

Again, this was absolutely intentional.  We now have generic code to
map a dev_t to a struct file_operations and is horrible to duplicate
this in devfs.

No.  Remember that devfs is just _some_ way to represent device nodes
to userspace and not even the preferred one.  You always need to claim
a dev_t range and if you want to support devfs in your driver you can
also create a devfs node.

Just use the proper APIs instead - that would be alloc_chrdev_region in
this case.

the major/minor split has become almost meaningless in Linux 2.5.  We
care about dev_t regions now.

no.  devfs has no business knowing about driver private data or
file operations - that's for a different layer.

There's still two places it is needed, and I haven't yet decided about
some API changes that might make it mandatory in most drivers.

Maybe you should try to work with kernel people instead of agains us?
I remember I tried to explain you all the API changes in detail and
even explained you the old devfs APIs you didn't understand until you
tried to piss me off as much as possible.  After that fortunately
Michael took over representing dvb to lkml and I had absolutely no
problems working with him.

Not with APIs as broken as the old devfs code, sorry.

What functions got different semantics but kept the old name?
