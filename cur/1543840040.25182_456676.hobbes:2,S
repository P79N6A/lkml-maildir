Hmm, maybe tasklist_lock covers too wide area.
we can add some other (RCU) lock just for linked list from init_task.tasks.
And pid_alive() will help people who want to access not stale task.
Now, job in fork() is
- set cpu allowed 
- set parent
- attach pgid, sid
- add to linked list from init_task
- attach pid
Then, adding for_each_alive_process() and new (RCU) lock for
linked_list_from_init_task_lock (divide lock) and change job as
- set cpu allowed
- set parent
- attach pgid, sid
- attach pid
new_list_writelock()
- add to linked list
new_list_writeunlock()
may reduce contention. for_each_alive_process() will do
rcu_readlock()
for (task =....)
	if (!pid_alive(task))
		continue;
rcu_readunlock();
Is this bad ?

I'll try some. But lseek on directory, which is modified at any moment, cannot
work stable anyway.

Yes, scanning the whole space is not good.
I think this can be handlerd by task_lists per pid-space.
Is pidmap is maintained per pid-space ?
