I would say that purpose of the feature is having ability to
build root fs for small embedded device, not support full posix 
attributes top of VFAT. I think the situation is like uclinux, 
which has no MMU support and many restriction, however it's still
very helpful for small embedded device.
To reduce resource consumption, developers for embedded system
would like to select one file system type to be used, if possible. 
And in most case, FAT is required for data exchange.
	E.g. memory/storage card or USB client. 
So adding small feature to FAT could have ability to build root fs, 
it's very helpful. It's not required to support full attributes.
What do you think ?
Thanks,
