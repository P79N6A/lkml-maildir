This lot all look like they belong in the FC transport class statistics
(some even already exist there).

These look to duplicate to some degree the figures
in /sys/block/<dev>/stat.  Isn't the block device the best place to
gather these, if they're useful?  Since user latencies should probably
include elevator times.
