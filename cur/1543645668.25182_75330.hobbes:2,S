    I'm spanish, too ;)) But let's go to the matter: probably the PID
you're trying to 'kill -9' is stuck in 'D' state (or any other
uninterruptible state), so it's not a kernel bug ;) If this is not
the case, you may have hit a kernel bug.

    AFAIK this is not exact ;) The 'SIGKILL' signal (that is, 9),
cannot be trapped and so its action cannot be changed. Moreover, it
is unblockable, so it's always 'fatal' ;))) it is always *sent*. This
doesn't mean that the process will die. If the process is in any
uninterruptible state, it won't be interrupted!. You will have to
wait until the process is woken up and then it will die.
    The more probable state, in my experience, is the 'D' state,
which if I remember well, is something like 'disk sleep', waiting for
disk i/o, etc...

    Oh... The eDonkey client... AFAIK, this is closed source, so any
problem related to this client is difficult (if not impossible) to
catch...
