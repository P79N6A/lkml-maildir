Hehe. That's exactly what a friend of mine and me wrote some time ago:
we added nice +20 as `idle' priority. Our small patch was refused on
linux-kernel in favour of the patch containing sched-idle and other things,
but if someone wants it, I can resurrect it.
For the moment I rescued a diff against 2.0.36, but porting it to 2.2.0-preX
is easy, jusk ask ;)
