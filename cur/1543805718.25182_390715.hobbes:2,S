It seems like every device I can lay my hands on either only supports 1.1 or 
doesn't specify what it is.  I'll try find something which is known to be 2.0. 
Certainly my 1.1 devices seem to work ok.

If I change "USB 2.0 legacy support" from "High Speed 480Mbps" which it was 
originally to "Full Speed 12MBps" then yes it does go away.  Although I'm not 
sure that's the best way to have it configured.
There is a slight possibility that this setting was changed in the bios which is 
why I am now noticing it, and that it wasn't as a result of a change above.
