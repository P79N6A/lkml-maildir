It's a rule for all our drivers not just for linux, also if we put the Maxtor drive to the blacklist so that its NCQ function won't be enable for all controllers of other vendors,but we don't have the strong evidence that those Maxtor HDDs are also broken for other controllers.

Thanks, I am using it on 2.6.22-rc7-git5, have run a stress test yesterday night.
It seems to be as stable as the previous version. I guess it's safe to turn it on by default when it gets into Linus' kernels.
I have a question though. Why is the blanket needed for Maxtor drives?
Can't it be narrowed down to certain models? Maybe those models should be put into libata blacklist...
Not that my current machine is affected, I am just curious.
Best regards,
Zoltán Böszörményi
