Looking at fdformat to get the util-linux version is perhaps
not the most reliable way - some people have fdformat from fd-utils or so.
Using mount --version would be better - I am not aware of any
other mount distribution.

Concerning mount: (i) the version mentioned is too old,
(ii) mount is in util-linux. Conclusion: the mount line
should be deleted entirely.
Concerning Console Tools: maybe kbd-1.05 is uniformly better.
I am not aware of any reason to recommend the use of console-tools.
