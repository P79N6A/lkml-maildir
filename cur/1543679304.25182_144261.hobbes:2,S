I interpret this to mean 'distribute a copy of the GPL with all
distributions of the source code, and make sure that it's followed', kind
of a recursive inheritance thing...
I'm still not seeing any evidence of anyone being blocked from obtaining
the source code (although I haven't followed the whole thread)
I repeat, did anyone ask dell for source code for this supposed violation?
They are not bound to _distribute_ the source code with their software
only to make it available in a reasonable fashion upon request.
Or am I missing something here ?
(not being argumentative here by the way, this is really interesting
discussion)
Cheers,
Al
