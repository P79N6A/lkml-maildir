Duh.  Yes somehow I had a blind spot there.  I clearly
need to handle that case.

That should work, and this may explain what is going on. I was trying
to figure out how this could happen but if the thread is running on
another cpu there is a race and it may exit quickly enough to cause us
problems before we get to kthread_stop.
I don't know if this is the problem but it certainly needs to be fixed.
