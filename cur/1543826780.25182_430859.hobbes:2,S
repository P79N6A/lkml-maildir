Just did :-)
Changes in the last 3 days:
Paolo Ciarrocchi:
      Added GPLv2 as the licence of this document
      Add an header with GPLv2 information
      First take at making the document asciidoc friendly
      Added a html version from asciidoc
      Further asciidoc changes
      Further asciidoc changes
      Added a newline
      Added a Makefile
      Removed the .html file, for building it just type:
      fixed a small cosmetic issue
      Added support of links in the hmtl file
So now you can simply type:
$make html
to generate the html version
$make clean
to delete it
Ciao,
