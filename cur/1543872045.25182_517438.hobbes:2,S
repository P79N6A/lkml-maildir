If we really want to, we could limit it to mlock for !root. This is
a reasonable way to solve the problem, and UML could fall back on
vma emulated version if they didn't want to use mlock memory...
Or we could limit the size/number of nonlinear vmas that could be
created.
But just quietly, I think there are probably a lot of other ways to
perform a local DoS anyway ;)
