Subject: [PATCH 0/2 -v2 resend] x86_64 EFI boot support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch set has been dropped because the 32-bit boot protocol is
not ready. Now, the 32-bit boot protocol has been merged, so I resend
this patch set.
Can this patch set and 32-bit boot protocol document patch catch up
with the merge window of 2.6.24?
Following sets of patches add EFI/UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware
Interface) boot support to x86_64 architecture.
The patches have been tested against 2.6.24-rc1 kernel on Intel
platforms with EFI1.10 and UEFI2.0 firmware. With this set of patches
applied, the 64 bit and 32 bit x86 kernel can be booted on x86_64
machine with UEFI64 firmware.
Because the EFI memory map is converted to E820 map in bootloader, now
the only needed code for booting Linux kernel on x86_64 UEFI platform
is the framebuffer driver.
UEFI specification can be found here: 
http://www.uefi.org
For booting the UEFI x86_64 enabled kernel, the machine with EFI/UEFI
firmware and the support of bootloader is required. Detailed usage
guide can be found in Documentation/x86_64/uefi.txt, which is added in
the patch: EFI boot document
v2:
- The include files of efifb.c is cleaned up.
- Make CONFIG_FB_EFI not depend on CONFIG_EFI.
Best Regards,
Huang Ying
