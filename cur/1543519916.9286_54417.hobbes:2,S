The one thing you don't see coming out in these reports is a statement of
the RAM type and speed - it would be useful to know the manufacturer of the
semiconductors, the manufacturer of the DIMMs and the speed, i.e. 7ns, 8ns,
10ns, PC100 or otherwise also the BIOS settings for RAM: all these
parameters can (and do) have a big effect.
No one seems to notice, but the RAM is VERY temperature sensitive, more so
than the BX chip would be (and guess what? the BX chip is situated right
next to the RAM).
Additionally, the overall layout of the board is VERY bad for cooling
purposes, the BX chip is in the shadow of the RAM and the AGP board
(incidentally, is anyone cooling the AGP board - you can could cook your
breakfast on some, the voodoo banshee, in particular).
I found that my board was very unstable until I addressed ALL the above
points, since then it's been great - two 366's overclocked to 550.
