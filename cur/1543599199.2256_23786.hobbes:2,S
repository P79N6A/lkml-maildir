	Hello all!
	I know that -perhaps- this is not a kernel-directly question, but
here it is:
	I have a K7,  1.2 GHz, 266 MHz micro with the A7M266 motherboard
and 256 Mb DD SDRAM. (I had a Pentium III, 500Mhz and just 128 mb ram).
What I see now is two things:
	1. the system is more loaded than in the pentium epoch
	2. sometimes, the system "stops" for small periods of time (< 1s).
	I am using 2.4.9 kernel. Can you give me any tip to get the most
from my system?. I'm recompiling all applications and, yes, if once
recompiled I can see that the system improves.
	Thanks in advance,
		Carlos.
