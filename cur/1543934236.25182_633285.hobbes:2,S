Okay, thanks much. So 0xf0 would be unuseable on 386+387 and AMD Elan SC400 
and could possibly change timing on an unknown number of systems due to not 
being put on the bus.
0x80 only fails for some recent HP laptops instead so it seems there would 
be not enough cause to go with 0xf0 onstead of 0x80 as the default choice; 
if we're quirking around machines anyway it might as well be the DMI based 
quirking currently suggested.
Rene.
