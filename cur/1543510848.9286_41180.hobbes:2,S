I wouldn't even look that far. Backups are for a last resort. If you have
mission-critical storage needs, parity and mirroring are a bare-minimum
requirement. And by your numbers below, it's quite a bit cheaper to have
arrays of mirrored disks and standbys compared to spending $136k on a
software license that still can't completely save you from a hardware
failure.
Application-level support is certainly a bonus, but I'd have a hard time
believing it's a requirement for the project being discussed here.
