Subject: small 5575 PCI ATM fix

I was grepping through some code, and noticed that the return value
of a kmalloc in iphase.c was not checked.
A patch was sendt to the author, but this was the reply I got:
"Peter Wang is no longer a member of the Interphase team.  Interphase
does support the 5575 PCI ATM adapter with Linux, but for driver enhancements
and fixes, we require a current software warranty contract.  If you
could send me the serial number and / or the MAC address of your adapter, I
can verify your warranty status and have the latest driver sent to you."
I do not care about their driver since I do not have an ATM card, but
the current driver should anyhow be fixed.
Please apply the patch below.
Regards
Petter Wahlman
