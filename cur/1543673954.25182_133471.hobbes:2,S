Please don't! For the same reason as the futexes, turning this off will
randombly break stuff and on a pc it won't give any benefit.
I'd vote for treating this patch just like the futexes one, making sure that
those who know *how* can turn epoll off, but leave it out of make config.
Furthermore, I wonder if this patch is a large savings, the bulk of epoll is
infrastructure, not the few syscalls.
