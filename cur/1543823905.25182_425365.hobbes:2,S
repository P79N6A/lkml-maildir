An indirect fix for this has been set out with a patchset with the subject 
"[PATCH 0/2] Fixes for node alignment and flatmem assumptions" . For 
arch-independent-zone-sizing, the issue was that FLATMEM assumes that 
NODE_DATA(0)->node_start_pfn == 0. This is not the case with 
arch-independent-zone-sizing and IA64. With arch-independent-zone-sizing, 
a nodes node_start_pfn will be at the first valid PFN.

You will still get the message about misaligned PFNs on IA64. This is 
because the lowest zone starts at the lowest available PFN which may not 
be 0 or any other aligned number. It shouldn't make a different - or at 
least I couldn't cause any problems.
