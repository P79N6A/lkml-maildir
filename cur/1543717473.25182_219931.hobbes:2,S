Subject: how to make side button (button 6) work with kernel 2.6.5 (logitech mouseman)

   I have the Logitech Cordless MouseMan Wheel mouse and while it's 
mostly working I can't get the side button to work (used to be button 6 
when I was using kernel 2.4.x).
   the problem is that side button is same as button 2 (clicking the 
wheel), as verified by xev.
   I use psmouse moudule, /dev/psaux device and "ExplorerPS/2" in X config.
   Her's what syslog says when I modprobe psmouse:
/var/log/syslog.0:May 10 23:30:27 jojda kernel: input: ImPS/2 Logitech 
Wheel Mouse on isa0060/serio1
   and here's my X config for mouse:
Section "InputDevice"
	Identifier	"Logitech Cordless MouseMan Wheel"
	Driver		"mouse"
	Option		"CorePointer"
	# Option		"Protocol"		"MouseManPlusPS/2"
	Option		"Protocol"		"ExplorerPS/2"
	Option		"Device"		"/dev/psaux"
	Option		"Emulate3Buttons"	"false"
	Option		"Buttons"		"6"
	Option		"ZAxisMapping"		"5 6"
	Option		"SendCoreEvents"	"true"
EndSection
and here's modmap that used to work with kernel 2.4.x (it still sort of 
works, the wheel is usable)
xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3 6 4 5"
   TIA
