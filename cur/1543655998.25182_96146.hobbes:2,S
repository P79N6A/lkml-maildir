ignore this patch. It is wrong.
So we have this:
if [ "$CONFIG_SCSI" != "n" ]; then
   source drivers/scsi/Config.in
fi     
endmenu
if [ "$CONFIG_ARCH_CLPS711X" = "y" ]; then 
   source drivers/ssi/Config.in 
fi
drivers/ssi/Config.in does not exist, make menuconfig crashes.
I thought it is a typo, but source'ing it twice also crashes, for sure.
So what is drivers/ssi/* ?
Or should this be drivers/sgi/Config.in ?
ciao, Marc
