WRONG!  module.h is designed to map EXPORT_SYMTAB to
"EXPORT_SYMTAB_not_defined" when the gcc command is incorrect.  In this
case the problem is the gcc line does include "-DEXPORT_SYMTAB", the
real problem is an incorrect Makefile.  Do not edit the source files,
take it up with whoever changed drivers/sound/Makefile in 2.3.50.  Alas
there is no change entry in Makefile so it is difficult to work out who
changed it.
