There is no patch labelled usb-hubc-build-fix.patch anywhere in 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.18/2.6.18-mm2/broken-out/
This suggests that the quilt archive is indeed messed up.

That is in fact where they belong.  Furthermore, that's where the 
origin.patch file from the URL above puts them.  It sounds like the 
contents of the archive don't match the contents of the directory.

That is wrong.  The module won't compile properly when CONFIG_PM is set 
and CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND isn't if the defines are placed there.
