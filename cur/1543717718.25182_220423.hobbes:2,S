Yep, you are right and we shouldn't worry about confusion too much,
we have similar situation till now (wcache was zero even if enabled).

Please look at write_cache(), it will try to {en,dis}able write cache
and then set drive->wcache *only* if disk has ATA-6 cache flush bits.
I think that we can change write_cache() to always allow enabling of
write cache so hdparm can be fixed to use HDIO_{GET,SET}_WCACHE ioctls
but we should be careful about always enabling write cache in a driver
(there may be some unknown yet side-effects).
Whatever we decide we can do this later after this patch is merged.
