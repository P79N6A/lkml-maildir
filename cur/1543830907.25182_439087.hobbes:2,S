I might not understand the issue well enough for getting your point.
My point is:
For users (= people compiling their own kernel), the obsolete in-kernel 
API is an implementation detail.
When configuring the kernel, the important thing for users is to find 
the driver for their hardware, not which internal APIs the driver is 
using.
The userspace visible part VIDEO_V4L1_COMPAT is something different, 
and it shouldn't be hidden.
