Switch Disk I/O hardware ATA-Raid 0,1,10.
Comes in 2,4,8 channel with ATA-33 based channel support.
This is the first true hardware ata-raid toy for Linux.
The 4 channel (tested here) is $245.00 US.
Patches to be posted on linux.kernel.org for 2.2 and 2.3 support to be
summited for inclussion.
Raid 1 report on a PII 233 with 72MB.
