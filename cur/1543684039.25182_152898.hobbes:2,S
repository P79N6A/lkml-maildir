02 = Receive checksum error. Your APIC bus is corrupting messages
sent to the CPU. This is a serious hardware problem, indicating
that the board hasn't been properly designed for APIC usage.
First try to avoid using the APIC bus: disable SMP and UP_IOAPIC.
If your BIOS allows it, set interrupt mode to PIC not APIC.
If you still get these errors (but you shouldn't unless the HW
is _really_ broken), also disable UP_APIC.
Or replace the board with something better.
