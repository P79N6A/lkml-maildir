If we're going to modify the kernel for this, far better to go in the
direction of kernel async IO.  That way you can just submit all the IOs
to the kernel at once and let it sort the IOs itself.  The kernel may
have a much better idea about the ideal IO ordering than you do,
especially if there is software raid or LVM involved; and  the kernel
can also delegate the ordering to the disks by using scsi tagged command
queueing where appropriate.
