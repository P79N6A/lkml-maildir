What version of the kernel and patch-set did you test against?
Over the last month I've tried *EVERYTHING* I can lay my hands on and 
can still cause a crash VERY easily!

On my DELL 1850 dual-core dual-Xeon system I did have a flaky DIMM which 
cause a few correctable ECC errors, but that has been replaced and still

machines [2.8 or 3.0 GHz chips].
