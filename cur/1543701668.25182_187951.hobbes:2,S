These systems are going to Texas and I am in Denmark, so I wanted to be 
sure that the
system also works under heavy load. This is not the typical use however ;-).

The patch seems functionally to be equivalent, I can test it first thing 
on monday. I agree that the loop
should be rewritten too, it is neither clear for reading nor very 
accurate when it comes to measuring
the timeout.
I also was planning to test this patch with a reduced timeout of 
3*HZ/100, do you think that is worth
testing?

P.S.
I will try to make my patches more minimal in future ;-).
