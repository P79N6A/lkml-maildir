DRI closed source ? You mean the fglrx driver from ati ?
Anyway my advice would be to look at dri project an
see the supported card list. 
http://dri.freedesktop.org
if you want a card with open source 3d driver.
ATI & Intel graphics chipset seems to have the best
open source support i am aware of. For ATI the r300/r400
(radeon 9500-9800/ X300-X800) support is still
experimental (IIRC there are PCI-E issues).
best,
Jerome Glisse
