Hi there,
I have a routine to be used in an ISR or BH, where I like to use
BUG(), to flag real bugs the caller produces, if he uses it with
wrong arguments (namely: check for asserted interrupts according
to a mask and flag an BUG(), if the mask is bogus).
So can BUG() be used in an ISR or BH?
Thanks & Regards
Ingo Oeser
