I don't know what SMS is, but Linux provides a stable ABI for stable
kernel series and only those.  We already have anough garbage from mistakes
in older kernel releases that we won't accept more with new driver
submission.  If SMS didn't use a abstraction library it would have a problem,
yes.

Sorry, I don't parse that.  There's no reason different architectures
should have differences in the ioctl calling convention, so there shouldn't
be anything to deal with in the caller either.
