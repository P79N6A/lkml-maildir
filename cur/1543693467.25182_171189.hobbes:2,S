Yes. It worked fine for halt/reboot up to and including 2.4.21.

I tried APM in 2.4.23-pre6, and it can halt the machine, but not reboot it.
Now I remember, because APM had problems with reboot or halt, I switched to
ACPI in the first place, when I got the machine 2.5 years ago.
`apm -s' does work now, though (which came as a surprise, since it didn't work
the first time I tried it a long time ago).

I went to the website Stan mentioned, and it doesn't seem to list the European
models. Since the Z600 series is called Z505 in US/JP, it may work with one of
the Z505 updates, though. However, I saw updates for W2000/XP only, not for the
BIOS.
