ACK.  Richard?  I have changed the thinkpad-acpi LED support to always defer
to a workqueue right now, but this *really* wants a LED class API fixup.
I'm for adding an specific hook for atomic access, but a flag would be good
enough too.
Well, so far so good for LEDs, but what about the other users of in_atomic
that apparently should not be doing it either?
