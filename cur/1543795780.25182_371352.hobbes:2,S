I'm not really using vanilla 2.6 kernels and my setup would be quite
hard to run on a vanilla kernel.
The reproduceability of this bug varies. Sometimes it'll go for a few
days without happening, sometimes it's a matter of a few minutes. I'm
beginning to feel it's a vserver issue after all, somehow related to
pid virtualisation (it maps some vxi->vx_initpid to 1).
Thus I cannot provide a simple script to trigger the bug (I wish I
could) but often doing a -j8 kernel compile in a vserver is enough.
