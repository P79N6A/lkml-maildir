I think it makes sense for atkbd and usb hid power and sleep buttons to 
be treated like all other keys on those keyboard types. As a result, I 
think it makes sense for ACPI keys to behave in the same way. I wrote an 
addon for hal to take input events and put them on the system dbus some 
time ago, so that's already a solved problem.
