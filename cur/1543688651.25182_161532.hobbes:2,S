Got problems with those patched. I applied them to 2.4.22-ac1 (didn't
complain much), however soundcore fails loading:
# depmod-ae
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in
/lib/modules/2.4.22-20030830-marlow/kernel/sound/soundcore.o
depmod:         snd_compat_devfs_remove
I've seen something like that in
http://www.geocrawler.com/archives/3/12349/2002/11/0/10252380/
 on the
alsa-devel list. 
Is your stuff pulled before that ?
Or is it just the fact, that i'm not automounting devfs ?
