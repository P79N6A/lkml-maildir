No, at that time I was running 2.4.1-ac5.

Downgrading the Bios does fix it, but that just shadows the ACPI bugs that
cause the problem. With 1003 + ACPI, mouse and keyboard both work,
but I've seen spurious scancode problems and keyboard weirdness that I
reported to lkml a week or two ago. 1005D + ACPI completely mess up PS/2
mouse and keyboard and lock them up after a while.
The solution is not to use ACPI until that is fixed. It appears that without
ACPI everything is working perfectly.
