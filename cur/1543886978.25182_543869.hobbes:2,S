Well you will find extensive "misuse" of all the re-e* words in
english, but all should be hyphenated. Moreover, there is no
license in english to just create new such words, you cannot
re-entertain your guests for example. In practice we do allow
creation of new re-e* words, as in re-execute, and that's
probably ok in techno-jargon-speak.
But re-enable is an old and well used word, reenable is not,
and I see no reason to encourage the latter incorrect use,
since it is harder to read (double e after r at the start
of the word is almost always a long e).
Note that in google, you always want to hyphenate. reenable
will catch only the misuses, re-enable will catch both.

Hyphens do sometimes disappear, but not for re-e*, OED version
2 does not allow a single such instance.

Indeed .. upto is not a word.
