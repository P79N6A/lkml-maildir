what do you mean? If something does lock_kernel() within spin_lock()
then the might_sleep() check in down() catches it and will print a
warning. (None of these warnings has triggered on any of my 3 systems
yet, suggesting that the problem is not widespread. In any case it's
very likely a _bug_ so we want to know!)
