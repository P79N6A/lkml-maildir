Are there even 1500 distinct PC motherboard designs in *existence*? :-)
Think, Dave.  The DMI standard dates from 1998.  For there to be 1500
entries on the blacklist, someone would have to have been cranking out
*500* PCI-capable, DMI-supporting motherboard designs a year each and
every one of which lies about having ISA slots.
This seems...implausible.
