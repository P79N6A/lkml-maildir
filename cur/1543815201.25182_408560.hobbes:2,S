This is a most confusing choice as 80% of the file has nothing to do
with bus mastering DMA, and a large amount of it has nothing to do with
PCI either. Also lots of DMA stuff is in the drivers so all the new bus
mastering drivers don't use bmdma.c
The split makes sense, the choice of name is peculiar, if not completely
broken 8)
