that's pretty peculiar.  We'd only expect to see atomics being used in
conjunction with atomic_add/sub/inc/etc.  Here the driver is using an
atomic_t as a state variable.  And here's the magic bit:
	spin_lock_irqsave(&ucs->lock, flags);
	state = atomic_read(&ucs->basstate);
	atomic_set(&ucs->basstate, (state & ~clear) | set);
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&ucs->lock, flags);
I'm suspecting that a plain old `int' would be more appropriate here.
