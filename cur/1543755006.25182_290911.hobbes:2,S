Actually, at least ia64, mips, parisc, ppc64, s390 and sparc64 also
support 32-bit applications on a 64-bit kernel.  All of those
architectures except s390 can use USB.  I guess vmware doesn't run on
most of those architectures but any solution in the mainline kernel
should be generic enough to handle them all.
