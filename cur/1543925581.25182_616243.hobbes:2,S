iozone -i 0 -r 4k -s 512m

The speed there is much better than in 2.6.22 and before (I skipped 2.6.23, because I was waiting for the per-bdi changes). I definitely do not see the difference between 1st and subsequent runs. But then, I do my tests with 5GB file sizes like:

My machine uses SATA (AHCI) disk.
