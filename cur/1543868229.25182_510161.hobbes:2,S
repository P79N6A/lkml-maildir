The way this is typically done is via Kconfig. Add a config option 
ASYNCDATA (actually something more descriptive/specific would be better), 
add a "select ASYNCDATA" to the config options for m101 and m105, and then 
you can use CONFIG_ASYNCDATA to decide whether to add asyncdata.o in the 
Makefile.
