I would love to hear his opinion,

Well waybe I picked with "fail on close" the wrong words, close always 
succeeds, but yet it's return value can signal error conditions.
$> man close
NOTES
       Not checking the return value of close is a common but nevertheless 
serious programming error.  File  system  imple­
       mentations  which  use  techniques  as  ``write-behind''  to  increase 
 performance may lead to write(2) succeeding,
       although the data has not been written yet.  The error status may be 
reported at a later write operation, but it  is
       guaranteed  to  be  reported  on  closing the file.  Not checking the 
return value when closing the file may lead to
       silent loss of data.  This can especially be observed with NFS and 
disk quotas.
So when closing a file with write-behind cache, close() signals in example an 
error (it """fails"""), as application I do not have close it again or to 
circle, but I have to live with the fact that something went wrong, and at 
least have to inform the user about this, (or return with the error level 
set, like dd or cp do it, if a close() """fails""".)
