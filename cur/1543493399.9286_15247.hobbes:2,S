Hmmm.... I should have put a smiley then? ;)
There is a good anecdote (for those with sense of humour) about famous
physicist Acad. Lev Landau:
One day an experimentator brought his lates graphs for Landau to
explain and the honourable Professor starting explaining each peak by
this and that theory of his. When he finished explaining the
experimentator says "But Lev Davidovich, the graphs you are looking at is
upside down"....
