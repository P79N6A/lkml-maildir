no problems like this for me.
GCC 2.95.3, SB16 "Value" (don't ask me why they named it that, it's just 
like a regular SB16 ISA as far as I can tell), vanilla 2.4.8, mpg123 is 
version 0.59r, says june 15th 1999, I'll see if there's a newer version. 
I also use XMMS and it works fine.
What motherboard are you using? is the SB16 PCI or ISA? if it's ISA do 
you have persistant DMA buffers enabled in the kernel? (not sure if that 
would cause this or not)
