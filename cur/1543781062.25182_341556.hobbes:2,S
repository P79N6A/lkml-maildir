I don't know.  Can I mmap kcore, set up a function that I want to try out
before putting in the kernel, have it modify the variables that are
mmapped, and see if all works?
Also, I've only used /proc/kcore with gdb, I never wrote my own core
parsing programs.
I like to do some strange things when adding stuff to the kernel, and
mapping /dev/mem to get to kernel globals from user space was one of
them.  I didn't just monitor, I did modify things as well.  But this was
all for R&D and testing. Never for the final product, so that's why I
don't mind a config option, even under kernel debug.
