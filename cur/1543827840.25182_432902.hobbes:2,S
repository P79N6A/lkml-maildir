Well, we did consider to do so, but we though that it would be harder to
get it into the kernel.
Actually thats the reason for the defines:
 #define        ATM_CELL_SIZE           53
 #define        ATM_CELL_PAYLOAD        48
Changing these should should make it possible to adapt to any other SAR
(Segment And Reasembly) link layer.

I guess you are refering to the rate table lookup system, that is based
upon array lookups.  I do think that the rate table array lookup system
has been outdated, as memory access is the bottleneck on modern CPUs.
But its design by Alexey for a long time ago where the hardware
restrictions were different.  It also avoids floting point operations in
the kernel.
Thanks for your comments.
