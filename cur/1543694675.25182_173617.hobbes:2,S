The exact speed differences need measurements and it might be that
depending on the gcc version and hardware the one or the other is 
faster.
I doubt it would make a noticalble difference in either direction for an
average user who runs Mozilla under KDE. -O2 is IMHO the better default 
since it's well tested through different gcc versions.
The more important point is that -Os code is significantely smaller 
which is important for some applications (e.g. a router-on-a-floppy or 
small embedded systems).
