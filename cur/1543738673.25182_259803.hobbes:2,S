Subject: [patch 10/10] uml: use always a separate io thread for UBD
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Currently, ubd=sync is different from replacing ubd#= with ubd#s=. This is
against Principle of Least Surprise, so remove this difference.
Also the current ubd=sync behaviour is completely useless: it is to make sure
that when the kernel has synched its I/O to the virtual disk, the host does
not invalidate this with his caching; this causes ReiserFS corruption.
But since actually we call end_request() only after the io_thread has done its
work, we never lie to the block layer. Using O_SYNC as we do when replacing
ubd#= with ubd#s= is enough.
