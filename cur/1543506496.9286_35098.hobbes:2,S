I don't know what you mean with "some while", but: That maybe because
Eric discussed it on the linux-mm mailing list (as recent as this may)
and not here. He was clearly _trying_ to get it into 2.3.x, I hope
he tries once more once the dust has settled over the page cache work.
I don't have the iron needed to tun R/3, but I like to see this
feature anyway.
