In this case, the problematic 2.5.74 patch you're referring to
is NOT the culprit.
His machine is a P3 not P4, and we've _always_ force-enabled the
local APICs for all P6/K7-family processors. The 2.5.74 patch
only affects P4s.
(I'm thinking about a lapic/nolapic pair of kernel command-line
options, and possibly changing the P4 default to only enable
if lapic was on the command line. That should solve the issues
with local APIC + ACPI in broken BIOSen.)
