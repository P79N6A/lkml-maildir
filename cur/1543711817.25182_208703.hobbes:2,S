It probably isn't, at the time you check it.  When you write a byte,
the call will generally return immediately because it'll be placed in
a buffer.  Transmission has only just started, and you then go and check
the CTS line.  Repeat multiple times on a slow enough baud rate, and
you'll end up queueing a lot of bytes.
You could write a byte, wait for it to complete by calling ioctl(TCSETSW)
without changing any parameters, and then read the CTS status.
