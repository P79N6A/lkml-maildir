We have lots of options which may cause problems but are useful for 
special situations, why is this one any different? The only actual 
benefit I've seen quoted for 4k stack is that it improves fork 
performance if memory is so fragmented that there is no 8k block left. 
And my first thought on hearing that was if that's common the VM should 
be investigated. This is a stable kernel, and breaking even such an 
abomination as a binary-only driver for the sake of whoever has this 
vastly fragmented memory seems to be the anthesis of stable.
