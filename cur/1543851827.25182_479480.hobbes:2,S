Yes, YES.  That's what I always tried to say during similar discussions.
In additional to the "default name" (which is, strictly speaking, is NOT
"default" in many cases, such as when you have USB drives connected or
not and all the sdX and srY renumbering, but that's different story, and
many devices are still has "default name"), there's another reason: kernel
should name the devices *somehow*, and it'd better the name exists in /dev.
Think /proc/partitions for example -- I don't damn want to see device numbers
(major+minor) in there, and all the tools searching the whole /dev to find
the device node for it.  By the way, lilo breaks if it can't find device
nodes in /dev listed in /proc/partitions, and I can't blame it.
