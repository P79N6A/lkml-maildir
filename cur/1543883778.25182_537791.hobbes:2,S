I like the Flying Circus and the other Monty Python films (including 
"The Crimson Permanent Assurance"), but "Meaning of Life" didn't impress 
me. But I have the song somewhere if this counts.  ;-)

I never expected the reality to be come as white as my ideal or the 
washed things in washing powder ads.
My ideal was white, and the shade of grey of the current reality is 
darker than I think it should be.
At least theoretically reachable are things like:
- every incoming bug report is quickly handled by one or more
  kernel developers who know the drivers and subsystems involved
- there's a last -rc kernel published for a few days of testing,
  and except for the Makefile change the -final is identically to it
  (or a new -rc published)
There are sometimes nonsensical bug reports and "handling" could be 
rejecting a bug e.g. due to a tainted kernel.
And sometimes mysterious bugs are more or less undebuggable.
But these two points would have resulted in 2.6.21 being released more 
or less at the same time, but with a dozen regressions less.
