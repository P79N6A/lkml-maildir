That's odd.  I've tried different mem= kernel parameters with no change 
in throughput under 2.4.  That is, 1G vs. 128M vs. 32M all perform the 
same under 2.4 when doing dd to a block device.  On the other hand, 
available RAM makes a HUGE difference when doing dd to a _file_system_.
I haven't tried that under 2.6 yet.
Anyhow, I chose a 1GB test run so as diminish cache effects and file 
system overhead.  Is my logic flawed here?
Thanks.
