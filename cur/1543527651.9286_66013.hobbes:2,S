Ok, you're right - I never thought of that...

Right.

Ok, so I see your point, and agree that you do need to monitor
the system with something.  Doing so in-kernel is likely a nice
easy way for you to do so, and that is fine.  I don't think it is
ok to put it in the mainstream kernel though, as it just ads
more bloat.  It would be useful for specific systems however.
Take care,
