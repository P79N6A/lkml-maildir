Syncookies only kick in when the SYN-RECV queue overflows. A connection established
by a syncookie basically "skips" the syn-recv state, it goes directly to ESTABLISHED
from nothing after the cookie is verified. This does not affect the still full
syn-recv queue.
You can increase the per socket backlog queue using the 
tcp_max_syn_backlog sysctl. This makes sense if you want to use 
timestamps/sack/window scaling even on a heavily loaded server.
