Huh??
sleep_avg is set at constant:
p->sleep_avg = JIFFIES_TO_NS(MAX_SLEEP_AVG - DEF_TIMESLICE);
The bonus calculation is:
#define CURRENT_BONUS(p) \
        (NS_TO_JIFFIES((p)->sleep_avg) * MAX_BONUS / MAX_SLEEP_AVG)
bonus = CURRENT_BONUS(p) - MAX_BONUS / 2;
None of the calculation that I see uses nice value.  Did I miss something?
