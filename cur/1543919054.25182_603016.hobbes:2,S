block_page_mkwrite() is just using generic interfaces to do this,
same as pretty much any write() system call. The idea was to make it
as similar to the write() call path as possible...
However, unlike generic_file_buffered_write(), we are not calling
balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited(mapping) between
->prepare/commit_write call pairs.  Perhaps this should be added to
block_page_mkwrite() after the page is unlocked....
Cheers,
Dave.
