Subject: 2.6.0-testX and pppd/pppoe stuck after connecting

Hello,
Ever since I upgraded from 2.4.18 to 2.6.0-test? (now -test8),
I have been encountering problems with my pppd/pppoe setup.
Specifically, right after the ppp0 interface is brought up, and several
packets go through that interface (4-5 packets RX/TX), no more packets
are transmitted until I restart pppd and reconnect to my ISP.
ping www.google.com will report 100% packet loss, and I cannot see the
TX packet count on ppp0 increasing. Nothing suspicious appears in ppp.log.
More often than not, I have to reconnect multiple times until at last
a working connection is established.
I may have not included all required information, but I don't know what
might be useful in diagnosing this problem (this knowledge would possibly
let me correct it without posting). I believe it is kernel-related because
with 2.4.x everything works fine in the same circumstances. The software
versions are: pppd version 2.4.1, pppoe version 3.3 (from roaringpenguin.com)
I would be grateful if you CC'ed me in replies.
Best regards -
Jan Ploski
