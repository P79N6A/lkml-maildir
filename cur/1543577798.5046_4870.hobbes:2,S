Thereby killing how many hundreds of innocent people? China doesn't much 
believe in fining minor offenders, remember. 
You don't like Spam? Join the club. Blacklisting any domain - ANY domain - 
for spamming, unless you can absolutely prove that no legitimate email has 
ever been sent from that server, is completely unacceptable. You complain 
about the wasted time and bandwidth caused by Spam messages - how much time 
do you waste every year blocking legitimate messages?
