Well, we need to solve this. It seems that CapsLock and NumLock should really 
be modifiers -- the assumption that CapsLock simply inverts the state of Shift is 
wrong. My patch solves this.

Addidng two modifiers is not expensive. But adding CapsLock, NumLock ( ->
and applkey) would actually require them to be used in most keyboard maps,
probably in combination with all the other modifiers they're currently
using. Thus, increasing their size 4 or 8 times. (Maybe the applkey is not
strictly needed as a modifier, but it makes things much nicer and cleaner
... with the new approach, making applkey a modifier does not hurt at all)
This was the reason I decided to go the keytable way.
The current default map has 7 keymaps -> 3.5kB ... * 4 = 14kB
The current "us" map has 9 keymaps -> 4.5kB ... *4 = 18kB
The current "cz" map has 42 keymaps -> 27kB
    Now, don't want to demagogic here ... maybe not all combinations
    with CapsLock and NumLock are really needed, but most of them probably
    are ... 27kB * almost 4 = almost 108kB
    !! Anyway ... the 27kB is bad enough on its own !!
Also, it seems that in the future it will be necessary to increase NR_KEYS
beyond 256 (probably 512 ?). So, better multiply the above numbers by two
;-)
Now ... with the keytables patch, there is a fixed amount of memory eaten
by the key_tables array ... NR_KEYS * 8 bytes in most cases = 2k (4k in
the future).
By adding many modifier-dependent meanings to a couple of keys, you
increase only the table associated with that couple of keys. The default
map I supplied uses 155 32B blocks = 4960B in 114 tables and 507 entries.
So the total is 7kB for the default keymap. Ok, this is two times worse
than the current 3.5kB but also two times better than the 14kB needed to
implement the current map with CapsLock and NumLock.
But the way is much better suited for future extensions. More keycodes
won't hurt. More modifiers won't hurt, even in combinations with the
current ones.
I haven't written the "cz" map in the new format yet, but it is obvious
that it would be just slightly larger than the default map (I'd bet it
would fit in 10k, not 27k, not 104k). Just have a look at these maps in
the old format, and try to count the number of VoidSymbols in there.

Well, not quite true in this case, because the new format is not a
traditional "map". It is a lookup table. Anyway, this is not important...

Seems logical to me. Defines what individual modifiers do to keys, instead
of having huge maps for every modifier combination you want to use
(possibly for a single key).

For very basic maps yes ... slightly larger. For usable maps smaller.

Well, the big and ugly part is the backwards compatibility code. This
would go away after some time. The rest looks like being cleaner and
better structured (?)

True ... both parts ;-) ... no, really, the tables typically have up to
ten elements, this shouldn't hurt

Sorry, I really could have splitted this. Will do.

Looks like a good idea. I will probably make the KDGKBTBL and KDSKBTBL
ioctls also use int for the keysym, because I just copied the idea from
the current system, where the unicode does not have full 16 bits (the ^
0xf000 hack). You're right, it would be very unfortunate to have to extend
the ioctls once again because of saving on bits here.
