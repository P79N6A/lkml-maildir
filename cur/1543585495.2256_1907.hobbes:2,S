Hi !
I'm changing the ADB bus reset & probe code to be in a kernel threads
that is created when a bus reset is triggered and that dies of it's own
death. 
Everything is fine when the bus reset is triggered during kernel init as
my thread is a child of init. However, when created as a result of an
ioctl, the thread becomes a zombie as it's a child of the process who
caused the ioctl (typically when entering sleep mode).
How do I force a kernel thread to always be a child of init and never
become a zombie ?
I do call daemonize at the beginning of the thread (as it won't do
anything with files, signals or whatever), but that doesn't seem to be enough.
Reagrds,
Ben.
