I really don't think that's a realistic option.  You're asking for
every call to the DMA API to ensure that the buffer and length are
a multiple of the cache line size.
So, what happens if, eg, SPI wants to send a 16 byte buffer, and your
cache lines are 64 bytes?  Does the SPI driver have to kmalloc a new
chunk of memory 64 bytes long and copy the data into that before
passing it into the DMA API?
If you start enforcing that kind of thing, I think the cache coherent
people will take violent exception and refuse to play such games - and
quite rightly so.
