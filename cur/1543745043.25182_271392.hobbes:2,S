There's already quite some code that's only licensed with GPLv2. Look
for example at arch/arm/common/dmabounce.c which does the same as you
want but with slightly different words:
 *  This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
 *  modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
 *  version 2 as published by the Free Software Foundation.
If you are the author, you can choose the license you like.
