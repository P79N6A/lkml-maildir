I didn't mean to imply that it was - just that it is much harder to determine
if the device is attached or detatched. That depends on the characteristics of
the interface and the cable (acting as an antenna).

It all depends - I've seen printers work perfectly ... and yet others
completely fail. The Xerox 5700 printers wouldn't work if the cable were
over 9 feet long. They would if a high signal quality data cable were obtained,
worked at 15', but no longer than that. Even then, they would not identify
(and neither would Zerox) what happens when they were powered off (you loose
data).
And yet no problem with a HP laserjet at 40'.
And the signals do vary if it is unplugged at the printer end and not
at the host end (major difference - shielded cable works MUCH better).
