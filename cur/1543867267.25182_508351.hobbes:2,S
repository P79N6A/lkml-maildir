No, I don't.

Every warning I'm aware of do have false positives. They are indeed
harmful, so one takes steps to get rid of them. If a warning had none
false positives, it should be an error, not a warning in the first
place.

That's the definition of a "perfect" warning, that is actually called
"error".

With almost any warning out there one makes more or less efforts to
suppress the warning where it gives false positives, isn't it? At least
that's my experience so far.
