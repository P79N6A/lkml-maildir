Thanks
I tried that as well butnothing much seems to happing. I searched 
the fs/Makefile for "ext2" It comes in the All_SUB_DIRS variable 
setting. I already have added myfs entry for this varible. That is 
the reason why it went to fs/myfs in make dep. But that does not 
solve the purpose.
I once again tell you what am I doing.
I created a directory as fs/myromfs. I copioed into this folder 
everything that was present in fs/romfs. Then I changed the 
romfs_fs.h to myromfs_fs.h with all MACROS changed appropriatly. I 
included this file in namei.c. I even made changes to all ROMxxx 
to MYxxx in inode.c file.
I changed the Makefile for myromfs as well.
Now my problem is  how do i compile it.
I tried make from myromfs dir. but it gave error as TOPDIR not 
set. So in the Makefile of myromfs I added a entry as 
$TOPDIR=/usr/src/linux/
That started the compilation but proper gcc params were not set so 
gcc failed. That made me confirmed that $TOPDIR must be 
comented.
Now I tried to compile from fs dir but again same mesage 
appared.
So I went one level up and tried to do make at /usr/src/linux
This is I suppose making kernel. It did work but with out much 
results.
I then went on to make dep here only.
This time it did go to fs/myromfs and displayed the message
'leaving the dir /usr/src/linux/fs/myromfs'
Now what should I do.
In otherwords, How do i create the new filesysytem using the given 
src and makefiles?
Thanks a lot for your Time and Space.
