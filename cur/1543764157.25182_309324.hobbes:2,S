I made some tests again, switching back to the onboard dual aic7902 scsi
controller (non raid) the tg3 dont hung anymore.
I just noticed the IRQ mappings change between the two settings.
The Broadcom eth get always the IRQ #25, the two onboard scsi controllers
get #24 and #25 (shared with the eth, is it harmful??) but the megaraid
driver gets the IRQ #28
I think it is something IRQ related because if the eth hungs but the kernel
is still running I see more than 140000 irq per second with "vmstat".
Hope it helps better!
