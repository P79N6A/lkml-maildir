Your dmesg you sent only had
	PCI: Via IRQ fixup for 0000:00:11.2, from 9 to 11
	PCI: Via IRQ fixup for 0000:00:11.3, from 9 to 11
	PCI: Via IRQ fixup for 0000:00:11.4, from 9 to 11
for the Via IRQ fixup, so I assumed that you only had regular ones.
No irq's over 15 according to that (and no, it's not because of the 
masking: you also had
	ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKD] enabled at IRQ 11
	ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:11.2[D] -> Link [LNKD] -> GSI 11 (level, low) -> IRQ 11
	ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:11.3[D] -> Link [LNKD] -> GSI 11 (level, low) -> IRQ 11
	ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:11.4[D] -> Link [LNKD] -> GSI 11 (level, low) -> IRQ 11
in there.
So the patch I sent should in fact have made zero difference at all for
you.  What's up?
