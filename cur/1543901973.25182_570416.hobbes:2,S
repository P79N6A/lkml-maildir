Isn't the code functionally the same as before? We still do atomic_test_and_dec()
as before. We still set_bit() CONT_RELEASABLE, we take the container_mutex
and check_for_release(). I am not sure I understand what changed?
Could you please elaborate as to why using a release agent is broken
when the memory controller is attached to it? I am not quite sure why we
need the synchronize_rcu() either in container_diput().
