Just something like this? Completely untested as I've not the hardware 
anymore. Googling for an old lspci, I had a revision 0x63, and Lev has a 
revision 0x65. The VT6212(L) should be 0x60+ it seems.
The "CC:" should be a "Tested-by:" if that's actually the case.
But yes, as he also asked, should this be the fix at all?
Rene.

    USB: VIA VT6212 10us EHCI sleep time select
    The VIA VT6212 uses a 1us EHCI sleep time by default which
    hammers the PCI bus bad. Use the 10us spec value instead
    as suggested by Lev A. Melnikovsky.
