Hi,
Looks like it gonna be a silly question.
I am getting some messages about unresolved symbols from depmod -a
each time I boot. Thought that is harmless until today.
Now I'm trying to set up an NFS and "modprobe nfsd" fails:
nfsd.o: unresolved symbol nfsd_linkage
In kernel sources I see:
nfsd_linkage defined and EXPORT_SYMBOLed in fs/filesystems.c
(linked in vmlinux and bzimage, I see it in System.map),
referenced from fs/nfsd/nfsctl.c (later linked into nfsd.o)
So, why modprobe can't see it?
kernel: 2.4.5
I did
make dep && \
make clean && \
make bzImage && \
make modules && \
make modules_install
Please CC me. I'm not on the list.
