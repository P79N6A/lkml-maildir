Yuck!  Some machines have 256MB, and I think 512MB of RAM image is just
plain stupid.  (256MB cached, 256MB uncached).  Looking further, one
such machine has:
	cached ram:	256MB
	uncached ram:	256MB
	ioremap space:	512MB	(from PhilB)
	io space:	256MB
In order to follow your suggestion, we'd have to drop the kernel from 0xc*
down to 0xb*.

Not if it follows the pci_alloc_consistent interface where we get returned
the DMA and CPU cookies.

When I went through the OHCI code (which has been eaten by many kernel
updates and rsync), I got down to the TDs and EDs, and realised that the
old cache tricks wouldn't work - there are situations where both the
controller and the CPU need access within the same cache line.

Comparing the SA11x0 documentation I have here and the OHCI controller
docs, certainly the register sets are significantly different.
It was also my understanding that the SA11x0 USB patches were completely
separate from the existing Linux USB code (or that is what I was told).
