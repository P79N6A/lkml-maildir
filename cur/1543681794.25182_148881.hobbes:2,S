    Kernel 2.4.18 segfaults when I do the lvcreate -s 
    Kernel 2.4.21 with the HighMem I/O fails on the lvcreate -s. 
    Kernel 2.4.21 without HighMem I/O fails but with High mem fails 
                  when I try to mount the snapshot. 
    Kernel 2.4.21 without high memory, and without high i/o suceeds 
                  in both creating and mounting the snapshot.
