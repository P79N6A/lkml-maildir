When I first set out to do it, I modified vmalloc.  But, I decided that it would
probably be easier to get a patch in that didn't modify vmalloc itself.  The
used calculation is much easier (used += requested_size), but the largest free
chunk gets harder to do.  I think that this would have required vfree to get
into the game as well.  It seemed much easier to just make meminfo do a little
more work.
