	Not to belabor the point, but not "almost", but "always".
You wouldn't want it to be under user control -- since
you could end up with non-deterministic or deadlock behavior.  This is
one signal that should always reset the action back to 'non-caught'.

	Dunno if those stats are kept around -- not to mention in a SMP
environment, it wouldn't be that useful -- lez say I have a 16 CPU sys.
My hog processu goes malloc and somehow I determine there are only 5 pages
left.  By the time I get that information back to the hog process (it may
get unscheduled), that 5 page figure could have changed N-times, making
it not so useful.  One could argue, however, that you could hold 5% of
memory in reserve for UID=0 processes, but what does that mean if we
are running in a capability-based system (where UID=0 means squat) -- I'd
suggest punting that issue to the next rev and deal with the most
pressing matter (I'm outa memory: HELP) more gracefully.  I guess we
could add a CAP_USE_LIMITED_MEMORY.  When there is x% reserved in an
ext2 filesystem for 'root', which capability does it use?  Is there already
a generic CAP_USE_LIMITED_RESOURCES?

	Sigh.  ;~)
