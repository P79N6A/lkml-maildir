You'll have to survey the lock graph and make sure that all locks beneath
the reverted spinlocks are also atomic locks. You can't sleep within an
atomic critical section which creates a deadlock situation. I suspect that
those warnings are related to that in one way or another.
That means any use of the serial or ethernet systems must have their
locks revert to atomic locks as well. However this make those places
non-preemptible and you'll have to be careful about this proces so that
you don't defeat latency performance with theses changes.
