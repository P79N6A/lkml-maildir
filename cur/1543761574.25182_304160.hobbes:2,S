We also use the additional level of indirection to implement suspend/
resume and relocation of virtual machines between physical machines  --
you won't get the same sparse allocation of memory on the target machine.
Also, this will make it much easier to support hot plug memory at the
hypervisor level since it will be able to substitute memory with very
little support from the OS running in the virtual machine.
I agree that adding an additional step would make this much cleaner.
