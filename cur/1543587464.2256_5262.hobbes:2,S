Hi,
While playing a dvd I was plugging a headphone and my machine froze and had to reset.
The machine was running 2.4.3 with the new aha7xxx driver.
I booted back into 2.2.18. It took a while to get pass the scsi BIOS. It finally detected
all the drives, but lilo would not find the scsi disk to boot. After several attempts it
finally booted but started to get scsi time outs from my main disk. My scsi adapter
is an adaptec 7895. The logs are:
Apr 13 01:16:17 inca kernel: scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 3797, scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0 Read (10) 00 00 88 aa f3 00 00 08 00

This has not happened before and the time outs are occurring intermittently. Are the logs
a signal of hardware error? What would be the steps to check the machine? Any suggestion
would be appreciated.
