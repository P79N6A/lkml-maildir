End of included message
I am using xntpd, and it does not seem to happen when xntpd is stopped.
I have also answered one of my own questions and found that it (fairly
obviously, I guess) doesn't occur if I leave /dev/rtc out of the kernel,
so I can a) get the problem fixed (or do it myself, if I have time) and
run with rtc and xntpd both enabled (preferred), or b) keep rtc disabled
and use cron to run 'hwclock --systohc' or the equivalent periodically
(works, but it's sort of hackish in my opinion)...
