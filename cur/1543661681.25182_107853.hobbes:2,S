GETTID(2)           Linux Programmer's Manual           GETTID(2)
NAME
       gettid - get thread identification
SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <linux/unistd.h>
       _syscall0(pid_t,gettid)
       pid_t gettid(void);
DESCRIPTION
       gettid  returns the thread ID of the current process. This
       is equal to the process ID  (as  returned  by  getpid(2)),
       unless  the  process is part of a thread group (created by
       specifying the CLONE_THREAD flag to  the  clone(2)  system
       call).  All  processes  in  the same thread group have the
       same PID, but each one has a unique TID.
CONFORMING TO
       gettid is Linux specific and should not be  used  in  pro­
       grams that are intended to be portable.
SEE ALSO
       getpid(2), clone(2), fork(2)
