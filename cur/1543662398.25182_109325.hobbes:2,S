  For work I'm looking into IPv6 for a big project coming up.  There's
alot of web pages out etc.  From the horses mouth though, what's the
state of IPv6 in the 2.4.X (20?) kernel trees?  Will it be stable enough
in 2.4.21/22 that it won't require usagi patches or will that be in 2.6,
etc?
Thanks,
  Robert
