Hello,
I have located a potential problem spot in 2.2.0pre9: My Linux 
distribution (SuSE 6.0, well it's not mine, but the one I use) has a 
symbolic link from /usr/include/linux to /usr/src/linux/include/linux.
In these times when I have several kernel trees around, I realized 
that I successfully built a 2.2.0pre9 kernel with the include tree 
from 2.2.0pre7. Only after I had removed the older tree I realized 
that my symbolic links point to nil.
I wondered what the Makefile could do about that. What about 
something like that:
TF=XXX_TESTING
L1=/usr/include/linux/$TF
L2=/usr/src/linux/include/linux/$TF
DATE=$(date)
echo "$DATE" >$L1
[ -f $L2 ] && SAME_DATE=$(cat $L2)
if [ "$DATE" != "$SAME_DATE" ]; then
	echo "Your links are not set up properly"
fi
rm "$L1"
Is it worth the trouble?
Regards,
Ulrich Windl
