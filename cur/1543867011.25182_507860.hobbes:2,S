If you call fsync in BSD then you get what you expect. anything that is still 
not on disk will be written. Afterwards fsync returns... So this should be 
the same like with linux?!

That is just a minor test.

The above line is what makes me wondering !!!

But the big question still is -- buffered or not -- where do the big 
variations within linux come frome? I am not writing small blocks. I write 
huge amounts of data. So the buffer will always be full. And: Linux is even 
slower then BSD if it can use a buffer. The maximum performance of Linux is 
42 MB/s (buffered) while the maximum performance of BSD is 48 MB/s (buffered 
or not -- i don't know).
If I use a normal SATA-II disk, there are no differences between BSD and Linux 
when writing to the raw device... So it cant be a buffer-problem alone.

This does not answer the big variation when writing with ext3 of +/- 5 MB/s.
I still don't understand the buffer argument. If one writes 25 GB in blocks of 
1 MB your buffer should be always full...

Is there a buffered io device that I can use, but that does not use a 
filesystem?
