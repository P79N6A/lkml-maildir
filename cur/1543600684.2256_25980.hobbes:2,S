The -ac tree has the LVM 1.0 code which is very new and updated reiserfs
code. That makes the combination trickier to debug. When it hangs do the
keyboard lights still work ? (that tells me if it hung irq off or on). In
the latter case enabling the NMI watchdog, and sysrq key may give useful
traces
