Thanks. Yup, filled with zeroes, and the corruption stops (but does _not_ 
start) at a page boundary.
That _does_ look very much like it was filled in linearly, then written 
out to disk when it was in the middle of the page, and then we simply lost 
the further writes that should also have gone on to that page. All 
consistent with dropping a dirty bit somewhere in the middle of the page 
updates.
Which we kind of knew must be the issue anyway, but it's good to know that 
the corruption pattern is consistent with what we're trying to figure out.
