Ah, great, then I needn't look through your code, phew (no offence)!

I'm sure Linus is right about that.  I remembered put_page_testzero
checking the wrong part of the compound page in its BUG_ON, but I'd
forgotten that release_pages ended up not freeing the compound page
at all.  Yes, 2.6.15 and its relatives do indeed leak there.

That may well be a good plan (given the doubts Nick raised about
whether dma_alcohol_rent gives the right kind of struct page non-slab
memory on all arches).  But one way in which the stars will be slightly
misaligned: for 2.6.14 and earlier you'll need to SetPageReserved on
each constituent of the >0-page, to get remap_pfn_range to map it (and
ClearPageReserved before freeing the >0-page); that won't do any harm
on 2.6.15 and 2.6.16 (apart from enlarging the code unnecessarily);
but we might one day remove those macros, from driver use anyway.
