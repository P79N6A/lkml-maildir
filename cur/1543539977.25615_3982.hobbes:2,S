Have you bothered to check this, or it's just a guess?
The truth is that the kernel does exactly nothing except printing
warning message about defective FPU. It's up to the application
to deal with the problem. Yes, it would be possible for the kernel
to check all executed instructions - guess why it doesn't do that?
The bug is only present on some non-MMX Pentium CPUs, they have no
updatable (nor downloadable) microcode.
