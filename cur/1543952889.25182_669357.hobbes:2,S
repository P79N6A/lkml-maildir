Subject: [patch 2/4] Markers - Update preempt_disable. call_rcu, rcu_barrier comments.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/19/587

Add comments requested by Andrew.
Updated comments about synchronize_sched(). Since we use call_rcu and
rcu_barrier now, these comments were out of sync with the code.
