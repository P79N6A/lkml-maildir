Hi....
I am intercepting incoming packets before they reach the IP stack in
"dev.c", and need to get/put information from/to user space from dev.c. I
assume that I would do this using the memcpy_to(from)fs functions, but
haven't found any real detailed documentation or examples on how to actually
go about it... Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
Dan
