Nick your mail got lost here, sorry.
I did rsync -av xeon2:/disc1 . on the target system.
xeon2 is the system that gets out of memory.
/disc1 is 60GB and contains several thousand files.
I think this is a common backup situation.
I found out I could trigger the memory outage using du -s /disc1 too.
