It may be very nice to ask confirmation for suspicious posts only.
Filter can discriminate messages into:
1.Obvious spam: drop on the floor
2.Possible spam: ask sender to confirm
  (with reason why robot thinks it may be a spam)
3.Not a spam: post without confirmation
This avoids problems with good messages being lost
and does not require human admins to read the messages.
