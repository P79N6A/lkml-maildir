the network ones are hard to fix, because it's softirq overhead and that
with PK is fundamentally non-preemptable. A good number of attempts to
cut down on the latency paths there resulted in broken networking, so
i'd not try that again.
The fix is softirq threading. Perhaps you could try PK+THREAD_SOFTIRQS
[but keep hardirqs non-threaded] - this would have higher overhead than
PK but lower overhead than full threading of all IRQs. This wont fix the
jfs overhead but that one might be fixable, maybe someone from the FS
land can take a look at the journalling overhead, that is in process
context and should be thus easier to fix.

yeah - they are in the latest (-33-03) kernel.
