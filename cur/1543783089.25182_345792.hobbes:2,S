I told you multiple times that I am doing bug fixes and maintenance on
1,000s of lines of contributed code. Is that not a valid reason to
have an account? So only people writing new code can have accounts? I
guess you will have to disable half of all the accounts on fd.o to
enforce that policy.
You censored the article. 
From the fd.o account policy page:
http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/AccountRequests
What the Project Leader does
      Review and approve the request for an account & access to your project.
I believe I am a member of five projects on fd.o and you are not the
Project Leader of any of them. I would like to see the request from
the Project Leaders for my account removal.
