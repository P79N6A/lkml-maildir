Did you look at how rmk does CPU selection in the ARM tree? He has
developed a very sophisticated scheme as there are lots of completely
different cpu implementations, using a few cores. It might be an idea to
make the schemes more uniform than they are now.

Ack. 
3. Embedded forlks might want to make a kernel which has support for
exactly the used processor and nothing more.

Ack. Same with for example Geode. And the subarchs might have different
implementations, like Elan SC400, Elan SC410, Elan SC520.

That seems to have evolved since I last touched the Elan stuff. The
Elans are more or less 486 cores with some edges, so adding -march=i486
should be ok.

I've just copied that from 486.

I could do some tests on an Elan board, but not earlier than end of next
week as I'm out of office for some days...
