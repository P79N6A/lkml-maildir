O_DIRECT has to much impact at the mentioned "vdr" due to unwanted side effects 
either.

Thanks for pointing this out - this clearly shows the effect.
Now consider a mildly loaded multitasking environment running X, some services, 
window-manager, email, maybe some databases and a streaming video-application 
at once (so does mine) - the video-file will have unwanted impact on all the 
other applications - leading to unnecessary reloads of lots of files, inodes 
etc.
