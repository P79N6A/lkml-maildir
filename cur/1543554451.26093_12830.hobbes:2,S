I followed the value of dev->refcnt and there is something strange. before
the call to register_netdev it is set to 0 and after that it is increased to
1. but before the call to unregister_netdev it is somehow 2.
How can I tell who is modifying it and when ?
I tried using kdb to find out but it keeps hanging the machine. I wanted to
place a breakpoint that will pop if a certain memory address is accessed so
I did the following:
static void *p;	(global - at the top of my source file)
EXPORT_SYMBOL (p);
in my probe function:
	p = (void*) dev->refcnt;
> insmod my_module
> ksyms
this showed that p is at address 0xd081ee90
then from within kdb:
kdb> md 0xd081ee90
0xd081ee90 c470bedc ........ ........
kdb> bpha 0xc470bedc
Forced Global Breakpoint at...
kdb> go
system hung
Is there a way to place a breakpoint on a memory address access ?
