I haven't tested that. I will, next time I need the drive, which will probably 
be in about a week. 
I just wanted to make my backup, and finally managed to do that. I don't get 
it either what's really wrong with these chips - but it was one of the 
recommendations i found on the linux-usb device list pages. And it seems to 
work.
If now only I can get the firewire part of one of them working without 
serialize_io, then I can use that too.
