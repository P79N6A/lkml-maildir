Note that Wine doesn't really require the 0x40 descriptor. As long as
we can trap accesses to it and emulate them like we do now, that's
good enough. Of course having a GDT entry would save a few cycles, but
this only matters for old Win16 apps, so I'm not sure adding even 1
cycle to the task switch time is worth it.
