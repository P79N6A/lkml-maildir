did this become "obsolete" in lunix 2.5?  yes, while gphoto2 is a better
solution (less crap in kernel) it would be nice to have something that
actually works and doesn't require a huge app to do stuff.  opendis is
also able to delete files from the camera, while gphoto2 can't...
what would i have to do to reinstate this driver in 2.5/2.6, bearing in
mind that i'm primarily a perlite that understands C, rather
than the other way around...
