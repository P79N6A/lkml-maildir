Sometimes what is best in the global picture is not what everyone
subjectively considers to be the best thing for him.

Instead of sending a bug report?
When removing an obsolete driver adult people suddenly start whining
"the new driver didn't work for me when I tried it one year ago".
And when asking where they reported the bug in the new driver the answer 
is that they didn't report it.
Driver development heavily relies on getting bug reports when something 
doesn't work.
