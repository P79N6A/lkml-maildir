At the risk of beating a dead horse, I'd like to clarify a potential
ambiguity.

	It is enough that there is an advantage to using consistent
memory on one platform (such as sparc64?) and the possibility of it
not being available on another platform (such as parisc), given that
you want the driver on both platforms (such as 53c700).  In that case,
we have identified three possible choices so far:
APPROACH				PROBLEMS
1. Use both memory allocators.		Increased source and object size,
   (as 53c700 currently does)		rarely used code branches, unneeded
					"if (!consistent)" tests on platforms
					where the answer is constant.
2. Assume only inconsistent memory.	Slower on platforms where consistent
					memory has speed advantage
3. Have "maybe consistent" allocation
   and {w,r}mb_maybe(addr,len) macros.
