Yes, but to my knowledge it is only the ITC that does software syncing. 
The TSC could use it as well, but doesn't. Other then that I haven't
heard of any other timesource that would use such functionality.
Since its possible to do jitter compensation within the itc timesource
driver (and within the fastcall code to preserve the existing
performance), would it be reasonable to deffer making the jitter
compensation code generic until another timesource needs it? It should
be a fairly simple change.
Or is this just something I'm being hard-headed about?
thanks
