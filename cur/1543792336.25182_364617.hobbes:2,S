My quick reading of the code says that we could have to 
allocate the struct right there in generic_make_request, and I don't
think we can be certain that such an allocation will succeed.
Code that uses io_context can limp along if it doesn't exist.  
The new generic_make_request needs this bio_list to be present 
or it cannot do it's job.
Just how tight are we for space in task_struct?  It seems to have a
fair amount of cruft in it.
Is it getting close to one-page or something?
Can we just split the less interesting stuff up into a separate
structure, allocate a separate page for that are fork time, and leave 
just a pointer in the task_struct?
