There are obvious asm/page.h uses, so just ripping it out won't be enough.
Even for that particular case.  And we have shitloads of places were
asm-foo/bar.h genuinely needs linux/baz.h for e.g. implementation of
an inlined helper.  With other targets not needing it at all.  Would you
mandate including it from every user of asm/foo.h?  And maintain such
rules afterwards ("asm/foo.h needs linux/baz.h included before it since
on $WEIRD_TARGET we include asm/unique_turd.h that won't compile unless
linux/baz.h will be aready there").
