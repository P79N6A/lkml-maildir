I didn't get any answers on this. I'd like to get this issue resolved, but 
since I don't even use libphy on my main machine, I need somebody else to 
test it for me.
Just to remind you all, here's the patch again. This is identical to the 
previous version except for the trivial cleanup to use "work_pending()" 
instead of open-coding it in two places.
