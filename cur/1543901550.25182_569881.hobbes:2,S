What I need is to ignore double delimiters such as (::). This can be 
done trivially with a string comparison to check for "\0". What I want 
to know is if it is ok to include the strtok_r code in my security 
module, or if strtok was removed for a very good reason. I am porting a 
lot of existing code which already uses strtok_r to a kernel security 
module.
Thanks,
Cliffe.
