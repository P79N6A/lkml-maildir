The only difference is that I don't see the "ACPI: PCI Interrupt
0000:00:0f.0[B] -> GSI
21 (level, low) -> IRQ 19" printk. The driver is AHCI but the device
is a VIA chip.
I'll get a caputre of the boot log when I find my serial cable. This
could be related to the VIA PIC quirks that was changed by Alan.
