Currently cpuset_exit() isn't in a rcu section so it wouldn't help.
But this ceases to be a problem if we don't leave the refcount
dropping in cpuset_exit() where it is currently - it doesn't drop the
refcount until it's holding manage_mutex, at which point it's safe to
hold a cpuset reference with a refcount of 0.
