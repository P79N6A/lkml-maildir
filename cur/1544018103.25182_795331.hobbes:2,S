Also document that it can only be set/cleared when you're holding the
inode_sem for the cgroup directory. And we should probably move this
enum inside cgroup.c, since nothing in the header file uses it.

Can you update the documentation to indicate what an error result from
pre_destroy indicates? Can pre_destroy() be called multiple times for
the same subsystem/cgroup?

But is this safe? If we do a pre-destroy, is it OK to let new tasks
into the cgroup?

I don't think that there can be a waiter, since rmdir() would hold the
parent's inode semaphore, which would block this thread before it gets
to cgroup_create()

I think you can merge wakeup_on_rmdir() and
cgroup_rmdir_wakeup_waiters() into a single function,
cgroup_wakeup_rmdir(struct cgroup *)

I think it would be better to move this check to after we've already
failed on cgroup_clear_css_refs(). That way we can't fail with an
EINTR just because we raced with a signal on the way into rmdir() - we
have to actually hit the EBUSY and try to sleep.

What about other potential error codes? If the subsystem's only
allowed to return 0 or EBUSY, then we should check for that.
