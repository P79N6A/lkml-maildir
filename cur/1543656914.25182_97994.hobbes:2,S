I'm still trying to follow a packet (or even better an sk_buff) from the
NIC card to user space.  I think I have a good chunk of it figured out,
but I'm missing a bit from the time that the __netif_rx_schedule()
routine calls __cpu_raise_softirq() until the routine net_rx_action()
occurs.  I read in a book on Linux TCP/IP implementation that the
softirq basically leads to a call to net_rx_action(), but I don't see
the connection yet.  It's probably due to my lack of understanding of
IRQ's (and software IRQ's).
Any help is appreciated.
Thanks,
	Josh
