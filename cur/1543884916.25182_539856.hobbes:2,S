Hi,
I found that setting the cpufreq governor to ondemand making the box 
lock up solid in 2.6.20.2 and 2.6.21 after a few seconds. Sysrq 
does not work anymore, and the last messages are:
May  3 19:16:58 cn kernel: longhaul: VIA C3 'Nehemiah C' [C5P] CPU 
detected.  Powersaver supported.
May  3 19:16:58 cn kernel: longhaul: Using northbridge support.
May  3 19:17:22 cn kernel: Time: acpi_pm clocksource has been installed.
May  3 19:17:22 cn kernel: Clocksource tsc unstable (delta = -136422685 
ns)
I have also tried 2.6.20.2 in single-user mode (so that I can have 
the disk readonly), and it take a little longer (magnitude: minutes) 
to lock up; not sure if it's 20.2 or the single-user mode but I suspect 
the latter since nothing is running then that could potentially 
contribute to quickly changing workloads/frequencies.
If you need more info, please let me know.
Thanks,
Jan
