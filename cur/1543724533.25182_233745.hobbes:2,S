Hi all,
The mouse attached to the Type 5 keyboard on my Ultra 5
stopped working when I upgraded from 2.6.7-rc3 to 2.6.8-rc1.
Previously, even with 2.6.7-rc3, I had to boot into 2.4.x
and "wiggle" the mouse to get it initialized.  2.6.7-rc3
recognizes that a mouse is attached.  2.6.8-rc1 doesn't.
Doing a cat /dev/input/mouse0:
2.6.7-rc3 w/o booting into 2.4.x first:
Nothing is read.
2.6.8-rc1 regardless of 2.4.x being used:
mouse device isn't seen.
2.6.7-rc3 after initializing moue under 2.4.x:
works.
