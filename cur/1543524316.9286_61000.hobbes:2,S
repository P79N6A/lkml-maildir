Well, here's another data point.  Removing the my laptop's CDROM
drive and PCMCIA cards did *NOT* get my keyboard working with 2.3.41
on boot.
I have yet to try Linus' other suggestion of modifying the delays
in some of the keyboard.c code.  I'll try try replacing the "inb"s 
with "inb_p"s and the "outb"s with "outb_p"s.
