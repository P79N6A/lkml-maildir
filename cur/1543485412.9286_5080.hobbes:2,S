Hello,
I am writting a Linux module device driver form some PCI hardware
our company has made. The problem I am having concerns interrupt
handling. I install the interrupt handler with
    iRetCode = request_irq
               (
                   PCIIrqLine,
                   &interrupt_handler,
                   0,
                   "our device",
                   &board_info_structure
               );
and call
 enable_irq(PCIIrqLine);
I have been able to confirm that our PCI card thinks that it is raising
an interrupt, but the interrupt routine never gets called. In addition,
checking /proc/interrupts shows
 0:     169002   timer
 1:          2   keyboard
 2:          0   cascade
 8:          1 + rtc
 9:      56601   eth0
10:       6136   aic7xxx
11:          0   out device
12:          4   PS/2 Mouse
13:          1   math error
15:          0 + ide1
a count of 0 which has never changed. That is, the kernel never receives
an interrupt.
I have also replaced our PCI device with another to rule out the
dodgy component possibility and behaviour stays the same.
I have been using "Linux Device Drivers" by Alessandro Rubini and have
rechecked everything he says on Interrupt Handling and PCI devices, and
as fare as I can tell, when it comes to PCI this is all there is.
If anyone has any words of wisdom they could share, it would be appreciated.
Or is there a good example of handling interrupts on a PCI device somewhere
in the kernel?
Regards
Greg.
