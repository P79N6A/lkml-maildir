The swapping is not a "operation" thing, it is global for /all/ what is
going on in the box. And having it swap less means assigning it more RAM,
i.e., giving it higher (not lower) priority than other stuff happening at
the same time.
I guess I don't understand what your needs are (not what you want to do to
get there).
