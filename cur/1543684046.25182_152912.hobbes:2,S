I did that for 2.4, that's indeed an option. I suppose we are completely
sure fbcon will never touch the framebuffer without going through those
fb_ops (fb_fillrect, fb_imageblit, etc...) ? That mean we would still
run a lot of useless code, but that's not too bad.
We still want the notification mecanism though, at least for proper
refresh on wakeup, and other "clients" (the DRI comes to mind) may
make good use of it as well.
Ben.
