I'm making a test suite for busybox mount, which does filesystem autodetection 
the easy way (try all the ones in /etc/filesystems and /proc/filesystems 
until one of them succeeds).  My test code is creating and mounting vfat and 
ext2 filesystems.
Guess which device driver feels a bit chatty?
PASS: mount no proc [GNUFAIL]
PASS: mount /proc
PASS: mount list1
VFS: Can't find ext3 filesystem on dev loop0.
PASS: mount vfat image (autodetect type)
ext3: No journal on filesystem on loop1
PASS: mount ext2 image (autodetect type)
PASS: mount remount ext2 image noatime
PASS: mount remount ext2 image ro remembers noatime
ext3: No journal on filesystem on loop0
PASS: umount freed loop device
PASS: mount remount nonexistent directory
PASS: mount -a no fstab
