).
Yes, i have read this helpful document, but there is about the memory usage,
mapping, and not exactly the buffering/caching.
Yes, i use the 2.6 series NBD.

Yes, it is enabled.

The NBD use buffer cache (i am sure), but the highest limit is about
830-840M.
Where can i get the split patch?
Thanks for helpful answers!
