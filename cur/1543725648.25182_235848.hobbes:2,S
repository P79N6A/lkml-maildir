Often when I use my PC (Celeron 900 with i815 chipset) as a serial
console for pther computers (mostly Suns), I get dmesg full of lines
serial8250: too much work for irq4
This might or might not be the cause of garbled output from the Sun -
many characters are dropped.
I turned off PREEMPT and 4KSTACKS and recompiled, this doesn't change
anything.
Load is normal desktop use, sometimes background compilations. IDE disk
is in DMA mode.
