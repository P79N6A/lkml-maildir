no strong opinion from me - but i think it should be obvious to the 
developer when they are looking at a .c file that it's 32-bit only (or 
64-bit only). I.e. the default is that whatever .c file we look at is 
unified - and in that sense relocs.c breaks that general expectation.
In fact renaming it to _32.c might spur its unification: people might 
say "hm, this would be handy on 64-bit as well". We might even do that 
to directories - so that for example arch/x86/math-emu/ would become 
arch/x86/match-emu_32/.
( Hey, and maybe someone is crazy enough to try to port the math-emu 
  code to 64-bit and boot Linux up on 64-bit with all user-space FPU ops 
  emulated. It would be one of the most useless hacks of all times, and 
  that certainly has a certain kind of sick appeal to it, doesnt it? ;-))
but it's really not a big issue, we can certainly leave it alone and 
observe the situation as more stuff gets unified. I'd expect it all fall 
into place naturally.
