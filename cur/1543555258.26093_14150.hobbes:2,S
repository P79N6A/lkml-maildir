  Hello.
  I'm sending you a small fix in quota. Currently on
systems with many different users there are problems that too
many dquots are bound in unused inodes. Following patch
fixes it - quota tries to get dquots from unused inodes
more than once.

PS: I already sent this patch some time ago but it got lost...
