That is more confusing. The user tends to believe such messages
and will start reformatting / fdisking etc, while in reality
the problem may be that she forgot to enable CONFIG_OSF_PARTITION
or so. (And there are also partition types, like AIX partition,
that the kernel currently has no support for.)
