I supplied some commentary in another email. I wasn't entirely sure
how to separate some free commentary from the ChangeLog entry in a
[PATCH] post. Sorry for the confusion.
The system I have, an Advantech touchscreen computer, has no DMI
information. So that option is out, at least in my case.
# ./dmidecode
# dmidecode 2.7
# No SMBIOS nor DMI entry point found, sorry.
I agree this driver would be best as a psmouse drive, but some
reliable detection code is necessary first. The serio driver does work
as is. If the user loads the liyitec.ko module or compiles the driver
into the kernel, she likely knows what she's doing.
I suspect there exists a detection routine using PS/2 commands that
will work, but I haven't figured one out yet.
Cheers,
Shaun
