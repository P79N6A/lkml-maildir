Actually the nmi watchdog state should be global, not per CPU.  We
want it to either work for the whole system or be completely disabled.
What is per CPU are the performance counter allocations, but these
can be forgotten over CPU unplug/replug.
(ok this means oprofile  might need to be restarted after suspend/resume,
but I guess that's reasonable)
