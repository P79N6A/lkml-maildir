Attached an updated patch, disallowing the option for all architectures that have been determined to potentially have
problems with the resulting relocations. Jan

Dunno.  You tell me - does it break any other architectures?  I don't know.
If you can identify the problematic code in powerpc and then see if any
other architectures do anything similar then that would give some
confidence.
From: Jan Beulich <jbeulich@novell.com>
As a foundation for reliable stack unwinding, this adds a config option
(available to all architectures except IA64 and those where the module loader
might have problems with the resulting relocations) to enable the generation
of frame unwind information.
