You need a newer kernel for i815 agp support. There have been many
improvements since 2.4.5, but if it works otherwise and you're not
affected by the security issues, knock yourself out. If you don't go the
new kernel route, in your XF86Config:
Option "NvAgp" "1"
This forces Nvidia's internal AGP support. 
In os-registry.c of the NVdriver module:
NVreg_EnableAGPSBA = 0;
was a requirement for stability on my system as well. As always, YMMV.
Good luck,
Reid
