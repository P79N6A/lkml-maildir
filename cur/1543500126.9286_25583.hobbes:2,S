Wrt. MacOS:
  1. I've never heard it announced as a Unix-killer,
  2. It's currently doing just fine, doing record sales, grabbing market
     share from M$
  3. The designated successor is based on (wait for it) ... Mach+FreeBSD!
Wrt. OS/2:
  Its death is a pure marketing effect: IBM didn't really market it.
Wrt. NT:
  Interesting enough, when you look at M$'s *technical* documentation,
  you'll find that they have a number of nice things to say about Unix in
  general and Linux specifically. Don't tell the marketing guys!
Then again, Unix didn't kill Multics, either ...
