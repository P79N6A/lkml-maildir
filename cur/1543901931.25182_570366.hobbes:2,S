Yes, this makes sense. However, it might break slab.
If I am not mistaken, slab code initializes multiple objects in 
CPU_UP_PREPARE and relies on the CPU_UP_CANCELLED to destroy the 
objects which successfully got initialized before the some object's
initialization went bad.
But then, I'm no expert on slab, so Cc'ing the right people.
There must be a way to share the code across CPU_UP_CANCELLED and
destruction of correctly initialized objects in CPU_UP_PREPARE 
(on a failure). That fix might be required before this patch goes in.
