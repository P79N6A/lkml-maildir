Hrm... I tend to agree with Russell here... 0x7f is the "safe" value
for IDE. IDE controllers with nothing wired shall have a pull down
on D7. The reason is simple: busy loops in the IDE code waiting for
BSY to go down.
Now, if your point is to keep BSY up and have wait loops timeout,
then 0xff may actually make some sense ;)
