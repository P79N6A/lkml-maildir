This checks only the possible size for an 32 Bit value and is only to
protect it for an oops, if you use a bigger index.

This is the test if the driver for that card type is compiled in.
SUPORTED_CARDS contains a bit mask for all selected (during make config)
cards.
In a new version (not published) this will be changed,because we support
more as 32 cards now.
