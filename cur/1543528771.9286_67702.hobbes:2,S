We've seen this on several kernels.  RedHat 6.0 and 6.1 demonstrate it
(kernels 2.2.5-15 SMP and single, 2.2.5-12 and 2.2.5-10, possibly
others).  I only have 2.2.5-15 systems available right now for testing.
Additional note: my network admin tells me that even a reboot won't
bring these interfaces back on line.  You must remove them, reboot,
then recreate them.  I know it seems weird, but I'm out of ideas.
