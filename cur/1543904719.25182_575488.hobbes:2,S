I/OAT / dmaengine patch merge path has been a complete mystery and 
unestablished. Dave Miller acked these patches during the merge window, so if 
Shannon can only send these to you during that period, and you are 100% likely 
to miss the Acks, this will never get merged.
Perhaps David should start merging I/OAT stuff instead? Someone else? Chris had 
the same issues when he was maintaining this.
