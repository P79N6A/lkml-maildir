It all depends what you're trying to track.  If you want to ask what
"this task" is accessing, then yes, ptrace.  But if you want to know
who's chmod'ing /dev/null to 600 you really want a file- or directory-
based scheme.  Rather than extending F_NOTIFY, it might be better to
look at selinux policies?

himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
