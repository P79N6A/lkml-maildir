Subject: [2.4] siimage locks hard on high load

I've got Asus a7n8x deluxe with on-board Silicon Image SATA and 2xBarracuda 
120GB connected to it in software RAID array.
On high disk load (e.g. cp -Rf /usr/src/linux somewhere_else) kernel locks 
hard after about 10 seconds (magic sysrq is not working).
It happens only when DMA is enabled. 
/dev/hda:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 IO_support   =  1 (32-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    = 16 (on)
 geometry     = 14593/255/63, sectors = 234441648, start = 0
Also, I'm not really satisfied with speed of this array:
/dev/md1:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  1.77 seconds = 36.16 MB/sec
Any solutions/fixes?
