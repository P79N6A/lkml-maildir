Yes. Imagine thread that tries to allocate memory with __GFP_FS while
keeping some file system locks. Now try_to_free_pages() calls
->writepage() method that tries to acquire the same lock. See, for
examples, comment before fs/ext3/inode.c:ext3_writepage(), or in
fs/dcache.c:shrink_dcache_memory().
