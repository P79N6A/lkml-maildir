Hi Matt, 
As far as I remember from my tests booting with 8MB yields 0-order (one page) 
dentry/inode hash tables, and 16MB yields 
1-order dentry/0-order inode hash. 
So we can't go lower than 1 page on <8MB anyway (and we dont). What 
is the problem you are seeing ?
Your patch changes 16MB to 0-order dentry hashtable?
On the higher end, we still need to figure out if the "huge"
hash tables (1MB dentry/512K inode on 4GB box, upto 8MB hash dentry 
on 16GB box) are really worth it. 
Arjan seems to be clipping the dentry to 128K on RH's kernels. 
I couldnt find much of a difference on dbench performance from 1MB to 512K 
or 128K dhash. Someone willing to help with SDET or different tests?
Thanks!
