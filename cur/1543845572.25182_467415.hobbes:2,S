Clarification, just as the system call clarification in the Linux
kernel COPYING file.  By explicitly allowing dynamic linking the LGPL
makes it clear that it is ok and avoids a lot of legal uncertainty.
It may be that the that linking doesn't legally create a derived work,
and that a bunch of the claims in the GPL are invalid, but to find out
somebody has to bring it to court, get a judgement (not a settlement),
and appeal it all the way to the supreme court.  And to be really sure
they'd have to do it in just about every country too.
