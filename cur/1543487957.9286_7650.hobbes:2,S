Sorry I cannot help, but:
I also get the this message in /var/log/messages:
    bug: kernel timer added twice at <some number which I have at home>
For me it happens when I try to mount a CDROM quickly after closing the
tray.
The drive seems to be not ready and the mount process goes into D-State.
They are unkillable for me also (I think this is a "feature" of the
D-State).
IIRC it appeared also when I tried to play an audio-CD and pressed PLAY
too fast (Not shure about this. Maybe I could kill the player later).
Some Information about my computer:
  Kernel: 2.2.2 compiled without modules
  Suse: 6.0
  Motherborard: Gigabyte 686BXDS
  Processors: Two Pentium II 350 Mhz
  Scsi - Adapter: Adaptec 7895 (build into the motherboard)
  CD-Rom: Plextor 40X UltraSCSI
Seems I have almost the same CDROM drive.
Would be interesting (for the kernel specialists) to know which Scsi adapter
Heiko has.
Is there a tool (or procedure) to convert the number of the error message to
something useful?
Greetings Thomas
