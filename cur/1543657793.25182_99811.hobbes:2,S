I don't know where the .text section is anymore, once the module is
loaded.  And just the .text section might not be enough on some archs.
I think it would be cleaner to have a userspace program which parses
the module, figures out how it is laid out in memory (this will be
arch specific!) and then (using the base address from /proc/modules)
tells the kernel "insert a probe at address 0xc1234567".  This should
be far more flexible, I think.
Thoughts?
Rusty.
