Well, I agree with the "at a more appropriate time" bit. But there's no
real need to make a bunch of complicated stuff out in userspace for this - 
we're trying to lay out the scheduler domains according to the hardware
topology of the machine. It's not a userspace namespace or anything.
Having userspace fishing down way deep in hardware specific stuff is
silly - the kernel is there as a hardware abstraction layer.
Now if you wanted to use sched domains for workload management or something
and involve userspace, then yes ... that'd be more appropriate.

Ummm ... but *none* of that is dictated as policy stuff - it's all just
the hardware layout of the machine. You cannot "decide" as the sysadmin
which node a CPU is in, or which HT sibling it has. It's just there ;-)
The only thing you could possibly dictate is the CPU number you want 
assigned to the new CPU, which frankly, I think is pointless - they're
arbitrary tags, and always have been.
