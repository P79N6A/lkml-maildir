Dunno if you're being humorous or not, but here's how I did it.
In the menu bar, hit edit, preferences,(brings up a new window) mail and 
newsgroups, composition, and at the top of the screen is the "forwarding 
messages" option box - select inline.
At least that's how it works in 1.7 - haven't used the older variants in 
a while... :)
