First of all, very nice script.
But, it doesn't look like it properly handles empty directories.  I
tried this command, this morning, and it blew up.  I think it's because
this directory 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/snapshots/
 is
empty because of last night's 2.6.4-rc2 release.  I don't grok python
very well but is the "return p[-1]" there just to cause a fault like
this?  Would it be better if it just returned a "no version of that
patch right now" message and exited nicely?

I think your script, combined with Rusty's latest-kernel-version could
make me a very happy person.
