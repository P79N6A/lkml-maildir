As you pointed out, you do need to determine whether an entry points
to a directory or a file. At the moment that means a full lookup of
the file handle for each candidate.

Possibly. Alternatively, one could perhaps use the directory's size as
an indicator whether or not to do a full READDIRPLUS or not. This is
(if I understood correctly) the approach favoured by other UNIX
