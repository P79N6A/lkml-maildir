I dont understand why this HOTPLUG stuff is problematic for Xen (or other 
arch) : If CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU is configured, then the map should be preset to 
CPU_MASK_ALL. Its even documented in line 332 of include/linux/cpumask.h
  *  #ifdef CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU
  *     cpu_possible_map - all NR_CPUS bits set
arch/i386/kernel/smpboot.c is doing the only sane stuff about it :
#ifdef CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU
cpumask_t cpu_possible_map = CPU_MASK_ALL;
#else
cpumask_t cpu_possible_map;
#endif
Some remarks :
1) These cpu_possible_map could have __read_mostly attribute.
2) cpu_possible(cpu) macro could be defined to 1 if CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU, or a 
test against NR_CPUS
#ifdef CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU
#define cpu_possible(cpu)   cpu_isset((cpu), cpu_possible_map)
#else
#define cpu_possible(cpu)   ((unsigned)(cpu) < NR_CPUS)
#endif
