I havenae been following this thread much, so I'm probably well
off-base here as a result, but surely, the obvious solution to this
is simply NOT to reuse a directory entry for an unlinked file whilst
the said file is still open?
If so, then all that appears to be required to deal with this
situation is an algorithm similar to the following pseudocode for
selecting the entry to be used for a file that's new to that
directory (either because it's been newly created or because it's
been moved from another directory in the partition):
 Q> Deleted = 0
 Q> Ptr => First entry in directory
 Q> repeat
 Q>     Case Ptr->Name[0] in
 Q>         0x00:    // End of entries marker //
 Q>                  If Inode(Ptr) found in list of open files then
 Q>                      // Can't step over 0x00 entry, so change //
 Q>                      // it to 0xE5 entry instead, and treat   //
 Q>                      // as if it had been such to start with  //
 Q>                      Ptr->Name[0] = 0xE5
 Q>                      Deleted += 1
 Q>                      OK = False
 Q>                  Else
 Q>                      OK = True
 Q>                  EndIf
 Q>                  Break
 Q>         0xE5:    // Entry marked deleted //
 Q>                  If Inode(Ptr) found in list of open files then
 Q>                      Deleted += 1
 Q>                      OK = False
 Q>                  Else
 Q>                      OK = True
 Q>                  EndIf
 Q>                  Break
 Q>         other:   // Entry still in use //
 Q>                  OK = False
 Q>                  Break
 Q>     EndCase
 Q>     If not OK then
 Q>         If Ptr is the last physical entry in the directory then
 Q>             If this directory can be extended then
 Q>                 Extend this directory
 Q>                 Ptr => Ptr->Next
 Q>                 // Since we've only just created this entry, //
 Q>                 // it must be available for use, so...       //
 Q>                 OK = True
 Q>             Else
 Q>                 If Deleted > 0 then
 Q>                     // ******************** //
 Q>                     // *** COMPLICATION *** //
 Q>                     // ******************** //
 Q>                 Else
 Q>                     ERROR "Directory Full"
 Q>                 EndIf
 Q>             EndIf
 Q>         Else
 Q>             Ptr => Ptr->Next
 Q>         EndIf
 Q>     EndIf
 Q> until OK
 Q> NewEntry = Inode(Ptr)
The only complication I can see occurs at the point indicated, at
which point the following are all true:
 1. We are dealing with a directory that can't be extended (probably
    because it's the root directory of that partition). 
 2. Every entry in that directory is either occupied or refers to a
    file that's been unlinked, but is still in use. 
 3. There is at least one entry that has been unlinked, but is still
    in use. 
In these circumstances, it would in my opinion be WRONG to report that
the directory is full since there is at least one entry therein that
we could use, and that's the real problem that needs to be dealt with.
In the case that the only references to entries in this directory all
refer to deleted entries, a simple solution would be to change the
range of inode numbers that refer to entries in that directory, in
which case the whole problem vanishes. However, that only deals with a
subset of the problem cases, and probably a small subset at that, and
it also requires the driver to be able to remap ranges of inode
numbers on request...
Other than that, I can see the following possible solution to this
complication, but I can also see the capability of causing other
problems that it has: 
 1. Insist that if we unlink an entry in such a directory when it's
    still in use, we change the inode thereof to point to an unused
    entry in an extensible directory.
Best wishes from Riley.
