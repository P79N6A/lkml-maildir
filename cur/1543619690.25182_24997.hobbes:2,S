spin_lock_irq is cheaper, though, and sometimes you _know_ it's safe to
use. For instance, if the function in question can block (ie never
called with interrupts disabled) then using spin_lock_irq is always
safe.
I've heard this portability argument before, anyone care to outline
_what_ the problem allegedly is?? Major part of the kernel uses
spin_lock_irq and I suspect we would be seeing lots of request list
corruption did it not work.
