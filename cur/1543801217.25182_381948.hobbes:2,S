Well, 90% of our managed Linux servers run 2.4.x kernels. Granted, 
that's only a couple of hundred nodes scattered all over the world; but 
the question is more, if I really want to integrate ttypld into our 
kernel/distro.

I'll let you know if I need it; I reckon it might not be too difficult 
to backport it anyway, so I can also do it myself ;).
Thanks and best regards,
