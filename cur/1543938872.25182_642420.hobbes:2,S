I hear you. 
But I'm not seeing many alternatives, unless we start taking write faults 
on them unnecessarily. Do we care? Probably not really. 
So we certainly *could* make ramfs/tmpfs claim they do dirty accounting, 
but just having a no-op writeback. Without that, they'd need something 
really special in the file time updates.
Personally, I don't really see anybody really caring one way or the other, 
but who knows..
