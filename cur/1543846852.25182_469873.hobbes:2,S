Existing design does not allow overflow.
If event was added into the queue (like user requested notification,
when new data has arrived), it is guaranteed that there will be place to
put that event into mapped buffer when it is ready.
If user wants to add anotehr event (for example after accept() user
wants to add another socket with request for notification about data
arrival into that socket), it can fail though. This limit is introduced
only because of mmap buffer.

But what if they are not dequeued immediateyl? What if rate is high and
while one tries to dequeue, system adds another events?

Initial implementation did not have it.
But I was requested to do it, and it is ready now.
No one likes it, but no one provides an alternative implementation.
We are stuck.
