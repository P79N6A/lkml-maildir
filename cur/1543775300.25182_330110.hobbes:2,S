disconnect method isn't supposed to clear the device structure in memory ?

But that's what I do !
I free it in  device release function = usb_disconnect in my case =
Process B. Process A is call by sysfs and don't seem serialized with
Process B.
Is there another place where I could free my private data later : I don't
think so.
The problem is that device_remove_file don't block if the sysfs file is
opened. So we must serialized A and B with mutex.

I believe some drivers expected that sysfs read/write callback are always
called when the device is plugged so they don't check if
to_usb_interface/usb_get_intfdata return valid pointer.
Also I always see driver free their privatre data in device disconnect,
so if read/write from sysfs aren't serialized with device disconnect
there are still a possible race like I show in my example.
