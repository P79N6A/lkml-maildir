I try to run my usual cd player and get this message under 2.3.16:
root:~> cdplay 2
hdc: packet command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdc: packet command error: error=0x50
ATAPI device hdc:
  Error: Illegal request -- (Sense key=0x05)
  Invalid command operation code -- (asc=0x20, ascq=0x00)
  The failed "Read Disc Info" packet command was:
  "51 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 24 00 00 00 "
cdplay: can't open cdrom (/dev/cdrom)
cdplay:  CD status is no_disc
root:~> cdplay 2
cdplay: can't open cdrom (/dev/cdrom)
cdplay:  CD status is no_disc
root:~>
Same thing happens when I try to mount a cd.
