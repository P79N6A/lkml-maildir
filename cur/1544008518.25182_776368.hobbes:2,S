I looked at them about 1 week ago.  I know that Ingo or the x86 maintainers
team update them occasionally, but I'd like to see a few changes or some
questions answered:
1.  Disable CONFIG_TR.  Token ring is antiquated.  No reason to be in defconfig.
2.  There are several security-related config items that default to =y but the
kconfig help says:  If unsure, say N here.  Like:
CONFIG_NETLABEL=y
CONFIG_NETWORK_SECMARK=y
CONFIG_KEYS=y
CONFIG_SECURITY=y
CONFIG_SECURITY_NETWORK=y
CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX=y
Maybe I just don't understand the current meaning/usage of defconfig.  eh?
Thanks,
