This is the default setting to minimize breakage.  And it has been set
like this (in the FC6 devel cycle) only in the last minute.  For most
of the devel cycle all were off.  For the distribution as a hole there
is simply too much of a chance for something to break and make the
system appear unusable.  This is mostly code in 3rd party apps.
Reason enough, unfortunately, for us to default on the safe side.
But I run my machines with everything turned off.  We cleaned up the
code we ship so that this is possible.
