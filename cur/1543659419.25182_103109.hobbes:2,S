Hello.
It's not right.
It's wrong changes in drivers/pnp/isapnp/core.c and could be fixed with
changing of two lines:
drop 
	protocol_for_each_card(&isapnp_card_protocol,card)
and change
	protocol_for_each_card(&isapnp_card_protocol,card)
back to 
	protocol_for_each_card(&isapnp_protocol,card) 
This changes fix compilation problems, but may be it wrong do it in this
way.
Best regards.
	Ruslan.
