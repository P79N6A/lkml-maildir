I see.
Since I updated the following 4 patches, please replace old patches
with new ones.
These patches are against e2fsprogs-1.39-WIP-2006-04-09.
  [13/21] modify format strings in print
          - change the format strings "%d" and "%ld" to "%u" and "%lu"
            respectively.
  [14/21] change the type of variables for a block or an inode
          - Change the type of 4byte variables manipulating a block or
            an inode from signed to unsigned.
          - Cast the type of operation in which an overflow occurs to
            long long.
  [15/21] add new functions which manipulate bitmap with 64-bit blk64_t
          - add new functions, which use 64-bit blk64_t and manipulate
            bitmap, leaving existing functions as they are.
  [16/21] enlarge file size and filesystem size
          - Add new option "-O large_block" in mke2fs.
          - With this option, the maximum size of a file is (blocksize)
            * (2^32-1) bytes, and of a filesystem is (pagesize) *
           (2^32-1).
Any feedback and comments are welcome.
Cheers, sho
