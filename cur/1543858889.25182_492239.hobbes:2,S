I do not believe is_init is the proper function here.  In the presence
of multiple pid namespaces the intention is for is_init to catch all of
the special handling (except signal behavior) for the init process.
That way when we have multiple processes with pid == 1 we know which
one we care about.

Makes sense as you have to be a group_leader to be on the task list.

Looks sane.
