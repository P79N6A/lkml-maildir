That's clear.  But I just changed my mind 8)
Because if you're going to demux the syscall, it might be worth
looking at FUTEX_FD: an "expected val" arg there might be worthwhile,
because to use it currently I think NPTL does:
	try to get futex
	fd = sys_futex(FUTEX_FD...)
	try to get futex again because of race
Have the futex_fd act like futex_wait, ie. return -EWOULDBLOCK if the
value != expected value.

Sorry, I didn't comment because I thought your explanation, concept,
analysis and code were all very neat.
Thanks,
Rusty.
