Confirmed, and completely reproducible :-(.  The good news is that
upgrading to 2.3.2 seems to have fixed the problem.
Now, if someone can tell me why 2.2.9 causes my CDROM burner to produce
coasters while 2.2.7 works just fine, I'll be an even happier camper.
The burner is a Yamaha CRW4416S.  SCSI controller is a BT-948.  The
burner is hooked up as an external device.  Forgive me if I'm not
particularly anxious to produce more coasters in an effort to assist
someone in debugging this problem.  I *would* be willing to purchase
some CD-RW media and work with *that*.  The only problem symptom is
that the write gets about 3-4MB into the CD, then the light on the
burner goes out, then some number of minutes later I get the following
syslog entry:

Not terribly useful, I grant you.  The cdrecord process complains about an
I/O error (duh!).  Same hardware setup under 2.2.7 works just fine.
