Subject: [BUG] Hard lockup using emu10k1-based sound card

I get a hard lockup when trying to play a mp3 with XMMS;
Sound Blaster Live card.  The first second loops, and I lose all
connectivity to the machine; I can't ping it, can't to a an Alt-Sysq,
nothing.
Details:
running RedHat 7.0
using kernel 2.4.0-test11pre4
emu10k1 compiled as a module
system is a Dell Dimension 4100 (815e based, 512mb ram, 3com 3c905c cardA)
I'll try to compile in soundcore and emu10k1 into the kernel, foregoing
any modules and see if that helps.  I will also revert back to
2.4.0-test10 as well just to test.  If anyone needs further information,
let me know.
Thanks,
Will Sarka
