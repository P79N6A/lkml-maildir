The futexes do all the high performance stuff you actually need. One way
to do it is to do user space signal delivery setting futexes off but
that means user space switches and is just wrong. Setting a list of
futexes instead of signal delivery in kernel space is fast. Letting the
user pick what futexes get set allows you to do neat stuff like trees of
wakeup without having to handle t kernel side.
What is hard is multiple futex waits and livelock for that. I think it
can be done properly but I've not sat down and designed it all out - I
wonder what Rusty thinks.
