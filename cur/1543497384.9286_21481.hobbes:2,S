What? /dev/random not uniform? You've got to be kidding!
I use /dev/random a great deal in setting up large n-body simulations,
which requires a very uniform distribution of numbers (huge monte-carlo
methods, srand() probably isn't good enough). If it doesn't have
'uniformly distributed' output, it really isn't random and I'd like to
know about that...
I did run some simple tests at one time and it looked uniform. But those
were pretty silly tests (i.e. make a million numbers in [0,1] and plot a
histogram).
