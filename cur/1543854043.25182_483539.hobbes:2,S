The fact that noone uses it (except for the 8 symbols I marked in June) 
might be a good indication that it doesn't fit into the current kernel 
development model:
- there is no stable kernel API and
- we lack a strict process for reviewing _every single_ newly added
  export - especially the many that get added without any in-kernel user
And if you'd take your EXPORT_UNUSED_SYMBOL() serious, any changes to 
the signatures of exported functions had to be strictly forbidden.
Please do either make strong promises about the API for external modules 
with all consequences or allow all API changes immediately.
But you currently allowing API changes at any time while putting high 
obstacles for my cleanup patches to remove code with zero in-kernel 
users is very close to a personal offense.
