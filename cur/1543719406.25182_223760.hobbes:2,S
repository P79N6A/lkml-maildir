In my experience, 2.95.3 isn't more broken than the average 3.3 
compiler.

The common solution in the kernel for such issues is to change the code

This might not be a perfect solution, but otherwise different drivers 
might require different compiler versions resulting in a chaos.
Whether support for gcc 2.95 should be dropped is a discussion for 2.7.
