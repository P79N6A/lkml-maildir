I got the following compile error in 2.6.0-test9 (using "make O=..."):
<--  snip  -->
...
  CC      security/selinux/ss/ebitmap.o
cpp0: security/selinux/ss/global.h: No such file or directory
make[4]: *** [security/selinux/ss/ebitmap.o] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
The problem comes from the following line in 
security/selinux/ss/Makefile:
  EXTRA_CFLAGS += -Isecurity/selinux/include -include security/selinux/ss/global.h
