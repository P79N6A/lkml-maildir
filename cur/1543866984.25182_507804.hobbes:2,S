What I was thinking is that in the not we place the physical address
and length that we load the real mode code at.  My assumption being
that we have marked the real mode code __init or the equivalent,
so we always load and just ignore it later on.

No.  For practical purposes we can say virtual addresses are for
the code and the kernel.  Physical addresses are for the loader.

It is some cleaner.  I won't call it perfectly clean, but it is
better.  It keeps everything but argument generation generic,
and there is already precedent in things like the vdso.
Playing the games with the addresses does allow the existing debugging
tools to work without problem because the end users of the code all
examine the virtual not the physical address.

I agree I want a reasonable bootloader as well.
With ELF we get a single file format that works on multiple
architectures and for multiple OS-s, with well understood rules.  This
allows for a broader audience who can review and maintain the code.
In addition to the real possibility of multi-architecture or multi-os
bootloaders.
What ELF cannot standardize is the how we pass the initial arguments.
ELF does standardize the initial parameters for unix executables but
the requirements of arguments to kernels, and the years of practice
are quite different.
ELF should make it much easier for people implementing simple
stand-alone executables for testing.  As you don't even need a linker
script or any fancy games if you don't take arguments.   Similarly
the switch from linux to multi-boot that almost standard is just
supporting a different argument passing format.
