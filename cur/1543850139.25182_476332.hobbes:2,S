I don't have much clue what the context of this is, but one chunk caught
my eye:

Based just on this snippet, it seems to me that kvm_create() could be
simply:
    open("/kvm/my_vcpu", O_CREAT | O_EXCL | O_DIRECTORY, 0777);
(Which currently seems to silently mask out O_DIRECTORY, but seems to me
should be a synonym for mkdir().)
