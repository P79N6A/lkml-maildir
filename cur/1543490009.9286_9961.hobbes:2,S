Nope. The changes to the NFS client between 2.2.1-ac7 and 2.2.3-ac1
are mainly in the form of RPC flow control.
I saw your previous posting about 'new' error messages of the form
'server xxx not responding'. Is this still the problem that is slowing
things down?  The reason for those messages was that the NFS client is
being told that the server is not listening (error =
-ECONNREFUSED). There are 3 possible causes: either a bug in the Linux
UDP layer, or a bug in your server's UDP layer, or you are using too
few NFSd daemons. In principle ECONNREFUSED is only supposed to be
returned when the server is rebooting or something like that.
If you could produce a tcpdump of what is going on, that would be very
helpful...
Amicalement,
  Trond
