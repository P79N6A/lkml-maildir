The overhead to do a timer is on the order of at least 100 us on an
800MHZ machine.  Given this, a timer/ interrupt based delay for less
than 100 us is probably a bad idea.
Still, times in this range and up are available in the high-res-timers
patch, BUT, while the patch makes a stab at providing POSIX timers for
all "arch"s the high-res part depends on the hardware and thus is
different for each platform.  Even for the x86 there are two versions
(three if you want to work with a machine that does not have a TSC).  
The upshot of this is that high-res timers will be available on some
platforms soon but it will take some time to find them on all platforms.
That said, there are a few kernel issues that need to be ironed out. 
Here are a couple:
1.) What interface(s) would you like to see in the kernel.
2.) Is there a standard compliant way to extend high-res to the user
APIs that currently, implicitly reference CLOCK_REALTIME.  The issue
here is:
CLOCK_REALTIME is rather firmly locked on to 1/HZ resolution.
The select() API (to give just one example) does not specify a CLOCK and
so implicitly uses CLOCK_REALTIME.
