Yes, Xen uses macros.
I figured a newish machine will have a newish binutils.  Looks like I 
was wrong.  I don't like uglifying the code, but if many users hit this, 
there won't be much of a choice.
[A minor problem with macros is that you can't let gcc choose the 
registers for you with instructions that have operands]
