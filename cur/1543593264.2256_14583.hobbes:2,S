Hi,
Sorry to disturb you.
Actually I had written a small file system(on 2.2.14 kernel) similar  to
RAMFS on 2.4 kernel. I am able to mount it but when I try to create
directory under it, it gives EEXIST error saying" file already exists" but
when I check the directory again that file gets created. But the link
count of the parent remains the same. I do not know how this directory
gets created but with an error message. Please also tell me what all
functions mkdir passes thro' while creating a directory. One more thing is
when I took an strace of mkdir command the syscall mkdir fails with
EEXIST error.
Please help me with your thoughts.
Thanks in advance,
Regards,
sathish.j
