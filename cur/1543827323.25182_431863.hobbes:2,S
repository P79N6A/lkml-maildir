Maybe, and maybe not. That depends on where ext4 is when the thing calms 
down.
Look at what happened to ext2. Would you seriously suggest removing it 
just because ext3 does more than ext2 does?
And yes, if I recall correctly, all the same ext2 people were against the 
whole ext2->ext3 split also, which we did for the same reason - I and 
others refused to let people "hack on" the standard stable filesystem.
Yet I don't see anybody in this discussion saying "I admit I was wrong 
back then - the split was correct". Hmm. I wonder where those people went?
