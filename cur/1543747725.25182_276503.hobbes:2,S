CONFIG_PROC_KCORE currently exists to allow ARM and others to drop
the nonfunctional /proc/kcore support from the kernel.  It wasn't
intended to be a configuration option as such.
However, if you wish it to be so, there's no problem provided that
the architectures are fixed up as you've done for x86, and that the
ability for certain architectures to ensure that this is never
selected is preserved.
