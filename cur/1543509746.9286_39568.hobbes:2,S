In ANSI C the integer value 0 cast to any pointer type produces a
null pointer (but a null pointer is not required to have a
representation consisting of all binary 0s).
A void * can be cast to any other pointer type.
It is perfectly legal and functionally correct to define NULL as 0.
It is probably functionally the same to define NULL as (void *) 0.
