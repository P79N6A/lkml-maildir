There seems to be a long standing bug with the buslogic SCSI driver w/ my
system. The system is a Dual P5MMX. Since kernel 2.1.105 (or so, I've
forgotten) the computer hard locks (leds wont change or anything) when
playing sound (via SB16). Problem does not occur in UP mode or when using
any other SCSI driver.
I've tested three sound cards, two other Dual P5MMX systems, and 2 other
scsi controlers (aic7xxx). 
The system only dies with the Buslogic driver (I'm using a BT-956C). 
Any assistance would be welcomed. If needed I can provide root access on
this box. Thanks.
