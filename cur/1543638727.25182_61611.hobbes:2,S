Hi,
Recently one of my harddisks began to develop bad sectors. I decided to add a 
another disk to replace the disk and run pvmove -i to salvgage as much as 
possible to the spare disk. But, the process takes seems to take ages. For 
every bad sector pvmove encounters it takes 5 seconds for the kernel to 
timeout and move on to the next sector. Some calculation would tell me that 
it would take approx 6 years to go through the rest of the disk.
So, is there any way to speed up this? I was thinking in the ways of reducing 
the 5 second timeout or having the disk driver simply skip the bad sectors.
These are the errors I get:

SeekComplete Error }
