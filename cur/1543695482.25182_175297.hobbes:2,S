What are your requirements, and why does udev not meet them?  Is there
some major disagreement between what udev does, and what you want to do?
If so, what?
udev has been out in the world since April, any reason for not helping
out with the existing project instead of going off and starting your
own?  It's not that I mind competing projects, it's just that I don't
see your reasoning as to why there needs to be two different ones.
