Yes, the prob disappears if usb controller driver is loaded before the
mouse driver.  Obviously I didn't know USB is "involved" here so I never
looked at the problem from this point of view before.  Now when I looked
at it, I see I have uhci-hcd driver being loaded in my 2.6.9 initrd,
before mouse (I removed it after as it wasn't needed).  I also tried
loading 2.6.9 without uhci-hcd but with USB keyboard/mouse enabled in
BIOS - the mouse is flaky too, similar to 2.6.10 behaviour.
Interesting.  I was looking at the difference in input subsystem
between 2.6.9 and 2.6.10 -- obviously there's nothing relevant here! ;)

Never had any single problem with this hardware so far.  But.. uh-oh.
Well.. it's only 2.6 kernel that encounters problem with it for now,
so it must be the kernel... ;)

What's the consequences of this?
If it does not hurt (does it?), why not to enable it?
And if it does not hurt, I can enable it in our default netboot
image as well.. if not to see whenever all our machines will work
ok with this parameter.
Thank you very much - this mysterious problem.. I was trying to
find the solution for quite some time before posting to LKML,
without any success, and the solution was already here! ;)
