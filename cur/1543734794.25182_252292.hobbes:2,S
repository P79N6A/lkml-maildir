Far from "just throw away" -- this is hard work! Very hard work, and a
number of people have already tried and failed.

The "safely call schedule() while holding it" needs quite a bit of
qualification; it's implicitly dropped during voluntary context
switches and reacquired when rescheduled, but it's not valid to force
such a task into an involuntary context switch and calling schedule()
implies dropping the lock, so it has to be done at the proper times.
This is a complex semantic that likely trips up numerous callers (as
well as attempts to explain it, though surely you know these things,
and merely wanted a shorter line for the bullet point).

I'd actually like to go the opposite direction from Ingo: I'd like to
remove uses of the sleeping characteristic first, as in my mind that is
the most pernicious and causes the most subtleties. Afterward, the
recursion. Except it's unclear that I have the time/etc. resources to
address it apart from taking on small pieces of whatever auditing work
or sweeps others care to devolve to me, so I'll largely be using
whatever tactic whoever cares to drive all this (probably Alan) prefers.
