We must make sure that the module is never deleted while there may be
calls to ->release functions - the exit function can only return when
all ->release calls have returned. This can be guaranteed if we (1)
don't allow the module to unload if there are outstanding kobjects (we
may need a "self destruct" knob then) or (2) make sure the ->release
functions are outside of the module (see, for example,
drivers/s390/s390_rdev.c).
(Gah, that stuff is always giving me headaches. Sorry if I'm not making
sense...)
