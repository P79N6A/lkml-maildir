The page cache limit is PAGE_CACHE_BITS + BITS_PER_LONG - 1.  On i386
that's 12 + 32 - 1 = 43 bits or 8Tbytes.  On 64 bit architectures the
size of off_t is the only limit.

The API certainly doesn't have any limits.  The page cache limit holds
for FUSE too, though with the direct-io mount option the page cache is
not used, so the limit could be removed as well.  I'll fix that.
Thanks,
Miklos
