/sbin/hotplug is suboptimal.  Even a pretty fast machine is slowed down 
pretty significantly by the ~thousand fork and exec that take place during 
startup.  For the most common devices -- common tty, pty, floppy, etc that 
every system has, this is a plain waste of resources -- otherwise known as 
bloat.
