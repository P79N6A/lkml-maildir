So you told me when I reported it to RedHat (the vendor in question)
and cc'd to you. I'll repeat the details for your reference:
 Q> AMD K6-MMX/233 with 128M of RAM, all EDO SIMMs.
 Q> Hard drive = /dev/hda = 1.0G Conner drive.
 Q> SCSI Interface = AdvanSys with onboard BIOS extension that
 Q> supports SCSI boot from CD.
 Q> SCSI CDROM = TraxData CD-R (Writer, not rewriter).
 Q> Distribution = Both RH 5.2 and 6.0 tried.
I've successfully installed RedHat Linux on dozens of systems, so I'm
no novice when it comes to installing, but I don't have the foggiest
idea how to get this particular system up and running.

In that case, you can presumably tell me precicely what we're doing
wrong, as I don't have the foggiest idea!!!
Best wishes from Riley.
