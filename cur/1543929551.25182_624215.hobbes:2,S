Sure! I probably missed your point... Lockdep always names reported locks,
so I meant 'hypothetical' only trying to explain lockdep with some other,
unknown or unnamed bugs.
So, depending on the code, above example with A & B could be a real bug
(even if very improbable but logically justified) or a false alarm (eg.
when we know both threads could never work at the same).
