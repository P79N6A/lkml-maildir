I mentioned it because I vaguely recall from my brief trial of it (no OSes 
that would install under it; it's not floppy-install friendly, or at least 
wasn't as of 1.0) that the source of the kernel modules was provided and it 
would compile them against /usr/src/linux if the provided binary modules 
didn't match the running kernel.
