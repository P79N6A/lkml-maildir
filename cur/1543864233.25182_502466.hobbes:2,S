One good way to fix scalability without all this braindamage is
to get rid of sb->s_files.  Current uses are:
 - fs/dquot.c:add_dquot_ref()
	This performs it's actual operation on inodes.  We should
	be able to check inode->i_writecount to see which inodes
	need quota initialization.
 - fs/file_table.c:fs_may_remount_ro()
	This one is gone in Dave Hansens per-mountpoint r/o patchkit
 - fs/proc/generic.c:proc_kill_inodes()
	This can be done with a list inside procfs.
 - fs/super.c:mark_files_ro()
	This one is only used for do_emergency_remount(), which is
	and utter hack.  It might be much better to just deny any
	kind of write access through a superblock flag here.
 - fs/selinuxfs.c:sel_remove_bools()
	Utter madness.  I have no idea how this ever got merged.
	Maybe the selinux folks can explain what crack they were
	on when writing this.  The problem would go away with
	a generic rewoke infrastructure.
Once sb->s_files is gone we can also kill of fu_list entirely and
replace it by a list head entirely in the tty code and make the lock
for it per-tty.
