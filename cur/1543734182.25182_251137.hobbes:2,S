DRI's memory allocator needs are very different to the others. That
probably means the kernel API should be very simple and push most of the
allocation to user space for rendering work. You want
"give me 4Mb" in kernel , but you don't want allocation for textures in
kernel (just profile the via driver).
fbdev does btw have memory management, quite a bit of it for some
multihead cards.
