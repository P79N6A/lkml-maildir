Even on pSeries, we already have CONFIG_POWER4_ONLY, which could be
used to optimize away some of the checks at compile time.
I think it makes sense to extend this a bit to look more like the CPU
selection on i386 or s390 where can set the oldest CPU you want to
support. This also fits nicely with the gcc -mcpu= options.

Fortunately, that optimization should be easy to do on top of your
patch, so we don't have to decide now.
