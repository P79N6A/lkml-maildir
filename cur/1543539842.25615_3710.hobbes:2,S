Hi Dick and others on the list.
Well my SC400 does not have a floppy but only flash card and internal flash
disk.
I have dos (witch workes fine) on the internal disk and I boot with loadlin
from the flash card.
I can easely boot dos from the flash card as well.
I have compiled my kernel (2.2.5) as a 386 with math emulation and I use
no-387 on boot.
There is no PCI support, and as a matter of fact it is a small static
kernel.
I have put in some code in setup.S to check if A20 gate handler workes, but
it seems that nomatter witch metod I use (or all) it doesn't get turned on.
But either way it puzzels me why it reboots.
Cheers
Gusti
