Actually, the driver has no need for a thread at all.  Since you're
simply using it to fire hotplug events, use schedule_work instead.
I also noticed the following in a lightening review:
- Kill these constructs:
+	/* scsi_done expects to be called while locked */
+	if (!in_interrupt())
+		spin_lock_irqsave(uhba->lock, flags);
scsi_done() doesn't require a lock
- Your emulated commands assume they're non-sg and issued through the
kernel (i.e. you don't kmap and you don't do SG).  This will blow up on
the first inquiry submitted via SG_IO for instance.
I'm sure there are others, but I don't have time to do a thorough review
at the moment.
