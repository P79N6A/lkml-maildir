Today, if a security bug is found in the kernel, you have to compile and 
install a new kernel.
With your system, the signature of a "trusted" binary is embedded in the 
kernel. Now, if a bug is found in said binary, you also get to compile 
and install a new kernel along with a new binary.
Since the application is trusted, a security hole in the binary equals a 
security hole in the kernel. In addition, you are bound to a given 
kernel <-> userspace ABI, so if it has to be changed, you get to keep 
several different trusted binaries around for different kernel versions 
(/sbin/module-validate-v1 for ABI version 1, /sbin/module-validate-v2 
for ABI version 2, etc).
Further, how is the module actually verified? If the trusted binary 
reads it and checks "something" (i.e. a signature), and then says it's 
ok, what is to say that the module is not changed on-disk between the 
time when the binary reads it and when the kernel does so (for instance 
by direct access to the disk). How do you expect the system to provide 
security if you are running with nfs-root?
In addition you must protect the user-space binary against a slew of 
attacks (you did statically link it to protect against LD_PRELOAD, right?).
What exactly is the advantage of user-space trusted binary signing?
