I like this stuff, but I think the first two bits are probably better
done in mainline proper, perhaps Andrew will consider them now that
2.6.0 is out. The -tiny approach is to make small tweaks on stuff
without diverging far from the mainline infrastructure. I'm trying to
keep most of the patches independent. I've basically already hacked my
owned version of the third bit (cpu support code selection) in an
earlier -tiny release, hadn't noticed the mtrr bits yet.
