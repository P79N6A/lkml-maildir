I don't agree here.
I think that we need a goodness() loop calculation in __sem_wake_up() to
extract
the more suitable task.
Suppose You have a lot of processes waiting on a semaphore with a number of
waiting tasks is always > 0.
Is this case the first process entered in wait queue never goes executed.
With a goodness loop solution a waiting task accumulate priority in counter
and
it will exist an exit door for the poor task.
Cheers,
        Davide.
