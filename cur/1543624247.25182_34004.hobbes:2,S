Hugh?
It would be helpfull if you could send me the System.map
corresponding to that, since this could make it clear
which particular timer function is involved.
lspci -v
hdparm -i /dev/hda
and so one are usefull as well of course.
I was already tempted to replace the above check by a BUG()...
Would you mind as well to just apply ide-clean-18 and ide-clean-19
on top of each other and recheck?
