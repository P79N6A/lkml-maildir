Does the drive work without the patch? If yes, please send me 'hdparm -i
/edv/hdc', 'lspci -vvxxx' for both the cases with and without the patch,
and 'cat /proc/ide/via' for the case with the patch. I'll check if all
the timings programmed really are correct.
Maybe we have a candidate for drive PIO timing black list. 
(check: no overclocking takes place on your machine, right?)
