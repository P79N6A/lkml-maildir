I have started to take a look at the IPSec functionality on the 2.5 kernel.
I have some questions in the area of the userland applications for IPSec.
Is the direction to definitely use the KAME-based setkey and racoon
programs?  If so, where will the ports of these programs live, on the KAME
site or somewhere else?  While setkey seems to be working very well, racoon
is experiencing some problems.  The availability of the ported source code
would allow for some debugging work to be performed.
Thanks,
Joy
