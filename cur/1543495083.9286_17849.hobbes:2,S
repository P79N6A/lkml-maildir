Subject: [patch] minor fix of MAGIC SYS RQ key [was RE: MAGIC SYS RQ Key]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

When using the magic sysrq key, if you release Alt before you release SysRq
the Alt key gets stuck down.  The root cause is that the up/down state of
Alt is updated correctly in key_down but NOT in k_down.  This persists until
compute_shiftstate gets called (when you switch virtual consoles or press
Ctrl-Alt-Shift together or ... probably other scenarios).
The "mini" patch included at the bottom of this message fixes the problem.
The patch is against 2.2.7.
I would appreciate feedback from anyone that has experienced this glitch
(and/or also from the maintainer of drivers/char/keyboard.c).
This is my very first patch.  Be kind.  :-)
