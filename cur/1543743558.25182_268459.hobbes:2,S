Subject: [Patch] Tiny update to Documentation/Changes , link to latest version seems to be link to archive...
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Here's a small patch that changes the text around the link to 
http://cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/kaboom/linux/Changes-2.4/
 to say that it's an 
archive of the file in various formats instead of saying that the latest 
version can always be found there - the latest version found at that link 
is dated 14-Oct-2000 01:18 which can't be called recent by any stretch of 
the imagination :)
