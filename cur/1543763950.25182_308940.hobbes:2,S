Well, "my" problem with the PM suspend has turned out to be at least partially
hardware/BIOS-related, so it is not easily reproducible.  It is being worked on,
however, AFAICS, so I didn't reported it all over again.
There also is a problem with the ACPI battery driver, which is known to the
right people, too.
Anyway, the patches that cause these issues to appear have been identified
(they both come from the ACPI -bk tree).
Greets,
Rafael
