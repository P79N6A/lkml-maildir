Hello Christoph,
  back in June your '[PATCH] NUMA aware block device control structure 
allocation' patch went in, changing ide-disk.c's code:
-   g = alloc_disk(1 << PARTN_BITS);
+   g = alloc_disk_node(1 << PARTN_BITS,
+                       pcibus_to_node(drive->hwif->pci_dev->bus));
  Problem is that pci_dev may be NULL - and it is NULL for example with
kernel I've just built, with amd IDE driver built as a module while with
ide-disk built into the kernel.
  I think that you probably want to guard your code by 
'if (drive->hwif->pci_dev)', as besides my silly configuration mistake 
also ISA devices have a chance to have pci_dev NULL.  Not that there are 
any such users if nobody hit it in the last 6 weeks...
  I've just built amd IDE driver into the kernel, where it belongs anyway,
but just in case please apply this patch...
						Thanks,
							Petr Vandrovec
