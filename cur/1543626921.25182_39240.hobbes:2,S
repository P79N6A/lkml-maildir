Quite frankly the spin-up-down-up-down-up behaviour of linux on
notbooks even if I let them entierly alone is to say the leasy annoying...
And noflushd didn't help me a jota on this issue. Second I don't
think that going though this cycle even on desktop systems does
really help the reliability of the wearings of the driver. For
some reaons I wasn't able to find all the 1000 parameters one has
to set before the whole thing does shut properly. Curing this by
settign some "low water mark" for the number of allowed dirty pages
is curing the symptoms - if there are no system activities there
simply should be no chance for some crepping dirty pages if this is
still the case there are just chances that there are simple bugs out
there. kflushd should by no chance flush the caches just in case
without checking whatever there was some activity in an ideal world.
