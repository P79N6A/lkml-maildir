Well, that's debatable. The warnings mean that either the WiFi driver
isn't catching them as it should, or that something else is generating the
same (shared) IRQ.
But what bothers me is that the kernel is trying to disable the IRQ and
not doing it. I think that's an issue, since on my hardware that meant the
system did nothing but write wrror messages to the log.
