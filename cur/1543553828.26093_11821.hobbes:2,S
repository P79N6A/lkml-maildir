We had a good number of reports that turning PPP header compression off
helped. The windows 98 connection I was testing with it did have header
compression turned on. Unfortunatly, I can't just ask the entire windows
world to turn off header compression in order to use our software. :)
I believe we've reverted all of our machines to 2.2, so testing this any
further is going to be a problem.
