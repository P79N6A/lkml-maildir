That's a problem - 1000/512 pages per 'usual' thread ends up with the
whole memory locked by malicious/stupid application (at least on Debian
and Mandrake there is no locked memory limit by default). And if such 
a limit exists, this will hurt big-iron applications, which want to used
high-order rings legitimely.
