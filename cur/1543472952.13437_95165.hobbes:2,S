I have had similar problems with X Windows.  The main similarity I see
between our systems is the Cirrus Logic Video.  Mine is a Cirrus Logic 5434.
Like you, I have no such trouble at the console, but window operations are
very erratic, i.e., X crashing whenever I stick/unstick a window or
resize/raise/lower a window.  In some cases, Netscape causes the X Server to
crash at random intervals.  This does not always happen, but if I force X
Windows to operate in 8 bit video mode, the problems disappear.  My color
depth is reduced to a paltry 256 colors, but the server runs.
