Looks reasonable to me for XFS.

So before, this clearing would happen directly in notify_change()
and now this won't happen until notify_change() calls i_op->setattr
which for a particular fs it can call generic_attrkill() to do it.
So I guess for the cases where i_op->setattr is called outside of
via notify_change, we don't normally have ATTR_KILL_SUID/SGID
set so that nothing will happen there?
I guess just wondering the effect with having the code on all
setattr's. (I'm not familiar with the code path)
