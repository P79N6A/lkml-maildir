I seriously doubt that. Try raising your maxproc setting (sysctl
kern.maxproc?) to something insane and try bombing again.
I tried to bring the box down by raising the limit to something similar
linux default and run the classic ":() { :|:& };:" However, the bomb was
stopped by maximum number of pipes and BSD survived.
If you don't hit the maximum number of processes you will hit another
limit.
