Yes, optimization is small, but I think this cleanups the code, which is (imho)
more important. That said, I don't suggest this patch, it was a question. I stiil
can't find a time to read the code hard and convince myself I can understand it :)
Also, I think such a change opens the possibility for further cleanups.

task->pi_blocked_on != NULL, we hold task->pi_blocked_on->lock->wait_lock.
Can it go away ?

See above. If I am wrong, we can move this line
	waiter->list_entry.prio = task->prio;
up, under ->pi_lock. plist_del() doesn't need a valid ->prio.
Thanks for your answer!
