On one of them I compiled the kernel with
 elfie:~ # gcc -v
 Reading specs from /usr/local/gcc3/lib/gcc-lib/i586-pc-linux-gnu/3.1/specs
 Configured with: /Src/gcc-20011203/configure --prefix=/usr/local/gcc3
 Thread model: single
 gcc version 3.1 20011203 (experimental)
and there were no problems yet (5 days up).
