Note that we'll have to have some good way of handling old drivers that
don't do this.
And the best way I can come up with is to have it be done in the request
list for such drivers.
Which implies that we should not have it in the generic path, but in the
per-queue path.

Why is it in md_make_request() at all?
md_make_request() should be able to avoid the bounce buffers naturally:
the low-level driver may use bounce-buffers, but md shouldn't need to know
that or care. Same goes for rd_make_request() - which needs to use kmap(),
but not actually do any bounce buffers. Or did I overlook something?
