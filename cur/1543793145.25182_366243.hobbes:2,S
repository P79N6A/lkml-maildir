+   Contrary to the patches for the 2.6.x kernels, patches for the 2.6.x.y
+   kernels (also known as the -stable kernels) are not incremental but
+   instead apply directly to the base 2.6.x kernel.
+   Please read Documentation/applying-patches.txt for more information.

    Alternatively, the script patch-kernel can be used to automate this
    process.  It determines the current kernel version and applies any
    patches found.
