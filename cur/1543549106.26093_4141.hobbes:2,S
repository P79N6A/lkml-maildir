This has been foreseen and hence we only allow 1 contiguous region per
page. If somebody tries to schedule a write to a second region that is
not contiguous with the first, then we flush out the already scheduled
write first, and wait on it to complete.
We also only allow 1 process at a time to schedule writes to a given
page. This is done in case the file access permissions turn out to be
untrustworthy: (due to e.g. root squashing and the likes) it means
that we don't end up clobbering the data from another process' pending
write.

Blech... It'll be slow, but as I said, only 1 contiguous region is
allowed to have pending writes on any given page at any given point in
time. Basically, you'll end up with 2048 byte-sized regions getting
written out from each machine. Each time a new write gets scheduled,
it will flush out the previous write and wait on its completion.
In your example, we will therefore in practice be doing completely
synchronous writes...
