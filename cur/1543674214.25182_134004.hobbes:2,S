No. They're definitely _not_ "kept in shape".
A number of headers have historical baggage, mainly to support the 
old libc5 habits, and because removing the ifdef's is something that 
nobody has felt was worth the pain.
I think the only header file that should be considered truly exported is 
something like "asm/posix_types.h". For the others, we'll add __KERNEL__ 
protection on demand if the glibc guys can give good arguments that it 
helps them do the "copy-and-cleanup" phase.
