Running 2.4.23 I get the following message from the aic7xxx driver
during boot:
scsi1:A:3:0: DV failed to configure device.  Please file a bug report against th

(The key bit is the first line... the rest are hopefully enough
context to make it useful ;-)  This happens to be a RAID I have
attached to the HBA, a 39160, but I get this message with other,
smaller RAIDs as well.)
I am dutifully filing a bug report, but frankly I have no idea either
from the message or the driver README or the driver source if I should
actually care.  Should I?  What's DV, and how is the device not
configured?  It seems to work ok.
I sent mail to Justin Gibbs but never got a response.
