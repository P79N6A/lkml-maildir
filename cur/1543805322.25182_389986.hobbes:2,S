Why should we care about compatibility with those interfaces?  Half  
our networking stack includes interfaces (like IPTables) that aren't  
compatible with _BSD_ from which parts of it were derived, let alone  
with Windows or Solaris.

No, it is correct.  We require /dev/* access.  The fact that we  
included /dev/sg* devices for /dev/[sh]d* was a mistake, and should  
be fixed, but those are still /dev/* access.

We provide enough information for everybody else to be happy,  
including the dvd+rw-tools package.  What else do you need and why?

Because I didn't see them.

I would encourage you to ignore all personal attacks.  The people  
making them are doing so frequently because either (A) they feel they  
have been attacked and are retaliating or (B) they don't have a valid  
technical point to make.  In either case the signal-to-noise ratio is  
better if you ignore the attack and don't respond in turn, which will  
frequently cause the offending party to cease their attacks as well.
One other note:  Please do not tell Linux kernel developers that you  
know what is best for the Linux kernel.  If you have a specific bug  
or a proposed patch it will be thoroughly considered, but vague  
declarations of problems are insufficient.
Cheers,
