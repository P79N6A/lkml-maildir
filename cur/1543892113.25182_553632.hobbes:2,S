Right but the process is terminating thus only requiring limited resources
to get finished. The process does not have the ability to affect the other 
cpusets. I.e. it cannot directly allocate outside of the cpuset. The 
system has that capability and the system is handling the termination of 
the process and should terminate the process in a clean way if possible.

The fact that process hang because of some software deficiency is an 
exceptional failure scenario. The system in general is not fully 
operational anymore anyways. Typically one or the other lock is held which 
makes certain kernel functionality inaccessible.
