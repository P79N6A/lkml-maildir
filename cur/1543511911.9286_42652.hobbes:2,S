I like to kill the old arrays (I was just going to writing about the above
step of killing the arrays before reading your email ;) also because it
will avoid to waste cachelines to read information of one single
blockdevice.
Also right now such array are bloating the kernel image as they are
initialized to null (and that's not necessary at all).
