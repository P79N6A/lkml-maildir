Because otherwise there is no reason to even waste a second with this.
At least for me and everybody else who has interest in portable solutions.
I don't care how it's implemented.  Look at the code example I posted.
If you can provide an implementation which can implement anonymous
inter-process mutexes then ring again.  Until then I'll wait.  If you
implement something else I couldn't care less since it's useless for
me.
