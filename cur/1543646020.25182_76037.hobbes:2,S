No. md0 would stay md0.  This is another effect of using superblocks,
and in fact this is also (ironically) more or less the only argument
*against* using them   :)
(Imagine inserting a disk which knows that it is disk 0 of md0 into some
machine that already has a perfectly fine md0 running)

You're root, it is indeed possible  :)
But you would not need to perform any of the special operations that you
need to now.
Persistent superblocks saves you from a number of "bad" situations you
can encounter with normal production systems (such as replacing a
controller or moving disks around).
One should be careful when moving disks with persistent superblocks
between systems though. You don't want the kernel to autodetect the
"wrong" md0 on boot   :)    I consider this problem nonexistent in the
production environment that I administer, but I know that some people
feel differently about it.  You should consider these pros and cons in
relation to your environment and make a decision based on that.
Cheers,
