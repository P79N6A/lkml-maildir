Subject: [PATCH 1/7] IPMI: don't init irq until ready
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/12/294

From: Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com>
Patrick found a race at startup.  Interrupts were being enabled for
the IPMI interface before the driver was really ready to handle them.
This could result in an oops if something was pending on the interface
at startup and interrupt were already enabled (technically shouldn't
happen, but need to cover for this in real life).  So move the IRQ
setup to the code that starts the actual IPMI processing.
Not needed for the stable kernel, very few IPMI devices have interrupts.
