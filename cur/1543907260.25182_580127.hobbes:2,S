It DOES NOT MATTER if I get a first pull request in the first week, if 
that pull request is purely cosmetic, and is followed by stuff that 
*should* have been in the merge window four weeks afterwards.

There's nothing arguable at all about it.
If you have 5000 lines of changes, that's not a "bugfix" any more. That's 
a big damn change, and it should have happened in the merge window. Or if 
it doesn't make it in time, in the *next* merge window.
