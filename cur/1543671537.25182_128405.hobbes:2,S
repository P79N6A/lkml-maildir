No. The hardware have far smaller physical limits. 
Current AMD64 CPUs are limited to 40bit physical, 48bit virtal
(the virtual limit per process in the current Linux kernel is 39bits) 
Itanium 2 afaik support a bit more 50bits (51 or 52, I forgot) physical,
probably more virtual.
Other 64bit architectures are somewhere inbetween.
The actual limit in the machines is even less. You will have a hard 
time to find an affordable machine (64bit or not) with more than 8 DIMM 
slots. That's 16GB Max with 2GB DIMMs.
