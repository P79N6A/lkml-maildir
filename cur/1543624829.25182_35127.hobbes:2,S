I agree with that, only for the reason that we are getting scarce on 
syscall nubmers. Is 256-delta the max ?
On the other hand, it requires to always push 2 more arguments
(operand and useless parameter).
One thing to consider is that many don't want to use libraries.
They want to inline, which would result only in a few instruction.
What I would like to see is an interface that lets me pass optional 
parameters to the syscall interface, so I can call with different number
of parameters.
