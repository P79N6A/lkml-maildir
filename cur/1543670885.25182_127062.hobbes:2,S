It seems that Geert´ idea would fit neatly into the current IDE 
system. Endianness of on disk data and drive control data are
clearly different things. A while ago Andre suggested to switch
the transport based on opcode to make it work, it might be even
more straightforward to set some flag when the handler is selected
or take a distinct handler altogether (ide_cmd_type_parser or
ide_handler_parser).
Otoh trying to solve that with loopback would mean new kernels 
wouldn´t even see the partition table of old installed harddisks
on some machines. Fixing that would require an initial ramdisk
that does setup the loopback device according to kernel version,
reading the partition table from a loop device and magically make
it appear compatible to the old devices.
