> ev5 ? No idea about alphas. gcc version ?
the kernel was compiled with 2.95.4 which is in debian's woody.  I also
installed debian's gcc-3.0 package.  it does compile dac960.
No, it's an EV4.  gcc 2.95.2 did nothing but eat all my memory on this file.
just out of curiosity, I have this dac960 controller with alpha 2.70
firmware.  I know it says it needs 2.73, but the latest for alpha is 2.70. 
Any ideas if it'll work or not?
If I loose the contents of everything on this sytem, fine, I have another
disk with the system on it so I won't loose anything.  =)
