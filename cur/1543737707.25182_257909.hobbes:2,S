That's not what I'd call "no place", that's "a place", and one you most 
likely have available lying on your desk. Even if you don't have the CDs 
any more you can always download the RPM you need from the net while 
running in rescue mode.

Just like Slackware has a log of all packages and the files they contain 
in /var/log/packages/ , so does RPM based distros like Fedora have their 
rpm database. The 'rpm' tool can be used to search the database for 
packages that contain a specific file, and once you know the RPM you need 
you can easily find it on your CDs (even if you have no idea where to look 
'find' should find it for you easily enough). Read through "man rpm" some 
day, a package tool without a database of installed packages and the 
files contained in those packages would be pretty useless.
