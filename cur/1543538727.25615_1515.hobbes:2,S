Hi
        somebody pointed out that mm->rss is defined as an unsigned
        long, I think this patch is needed to do the desired effect.
        I have not founded other invalid uses of mm->rss.  Only that
        in someplaces it is tested against (mm->rss <= 0) instead of
        (mm->rss == 0).  I think that the last checks are harmless.
Later, Juan.
