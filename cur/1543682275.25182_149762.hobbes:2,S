I was telling Con that when I first trying the O7int patch, after
a series of activities (mutt, xmms, licq, firebird, blah, and blah),
i experienced high loads (2.00+, 3.00+ - that is pretty high for me
already, considering the reasonably high-end laptop i am using). xmms
seem to starved. doing top, i discovered that most, if not all the
X apps that i am running at the moment are in low priority, that is
18-25 at least. compiling kernel, listening to mp3s, typing something
seems difficult. i couldn't deduce what has really gone wrong. i have
not experience this before (O6.1int, and below).
Any idea?
Eugene
