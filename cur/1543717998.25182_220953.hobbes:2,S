You nipped away part of code that does hashing.

Swapping upper half of first block with lower half of second block between
multiple iterations of encryption is correct way to extend block length.

May I suggest that you read and understand the code before publishing
incorrect conclusions.

Recommended way of setting up encryption keys in loop-AES, is to use gpg
encrypted key file with random keys. gpg does all that salted+iterated key
setup without any user intervention. That quoted part of code is there for
backward compatibility.

You said that I was spreading FUD. I said you are wrong. Fortunately
at least some of mainline kernel dudes seem to understand:

Optimized dictionary attack can be prevented using better mount and losetup
programs. Mainline util-linux is still backdoored.
Watermark attack is very much cryptoloop's and dm-crypt's responsibility.

As long as there are only promises, and unfixed exploitable vulnerabilities
remain in mainline cryptoloop+util-linux and dm-crypt+cryptsetup, people
continue to be scammed to using backdoored crypto.

Wrong list, sorry. It was CC'd to cryptoapi-devel:
