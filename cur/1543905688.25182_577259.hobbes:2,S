Hello,
after my problems with my DVD drive, I've unplugged this device and 
jumpered my burning device as master, to start my linux setup from there.
Now I don't longer get those silly DVD errors, but now I get something, 
which is much more worrying for me:

After mounting my four LVs, formatted with XFS, here, I'm starting to 
delete all files on those LVs to be able to do a fresh linux install. 
While deleting, I get *many* DMA errors and "BAD CRC" messages.
Maybe someone has a minute of time to tell me who is responsible for 
this errors. Does the kernel not work very well with my IDE controller? 
Is there a defect in the IDE controller? Is there a problem with my HDD?
Thank you *very* much in advance for any information about this...
Yours
Manuel
