Can we say framebuffer devices. As graphics cards are placed into more 
and more different types of systems we need to have a way to make these
cards workable on different platforms. This requires us to write
drivers that can initialize a mode without firmware. I have reworked the
console layer to deal with this and with allowing different modes on
different VCs. The current system allows it too but it is more of a later
add on hack. I have a much cleaner implementation which does what you ask 
of the above.

Really. I have my own personal compain to make all the graphics drivers
firmware independent. I even like to see the VGA console driver also
firmware independent.
