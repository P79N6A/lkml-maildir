I'm using the megaraid 1.19.6 driver on RedHat Work Station 
x86_64.  It works great with only 4 gigs of RAM installed, 
but it locks up when I load the module with 8 gigs of RAM 
installed.  It generally locks up in the issue_scb_block() 
but it's not always consistent about which line it locks 
up on within that function.
On the default Suse Linux Enterprise Server 8 the module 
loads but after around 5 hours of running drive tests the 
drives stop responding.
I also tried the megaraid2 module and that kernel panics 
when the module is loaded.
I'm using an arima motherboard with the 1.84 BIOS.
Is this a known issue?  Has anyone been able to make a 
similar config work?
regards,
dan carpenter
