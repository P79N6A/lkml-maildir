Ok, I've rxed the device and it looks like some driver debugging is
in order.  [This is the brainboxes card btw ,{www.brainboxes.com}]
The 2.4 behaviour is that it is found by the pcmcia later on 
insertion and allocates/finds its irq  + i/o. serail.c 
detects the uart + irq also. 
But in operation no irq's are received, data does come in
an out the UART _slowly_ , as if serial.c as fallen-back to
polled operation.
{Interestingly enough 2.2 wouldn't allocate the irq at all,
 even though my modem works fine! }
2.4 doesn't see the second port. {Neither does 2.2 but if
i read the pcmcia code correctly setup is aborted after the
RequestIRQ() fails}.
I've got a contact name at the manufacturer I can talk to
on Monday about getting this sorted, so I will work on the drivers
then if I can. However in the meantime does anyone know any tricks
I could play, if I could resurrect the card today I would be v. 
_grateful_.
I willing to concentrate on 2.4 since I guess that will be the
path of least resistance, what with correct uart support and 
intergated pcmcia stuff.
More info, testing etc on request.
