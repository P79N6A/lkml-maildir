I have a few questions about what some of the macros from <linux/module.h>.
Specifically:
MODULE_SUPPORTED_DEV() appears to be the base device name of the device. The
only instance I found of it being used was the floppy device. Is it used as
anything more than an informative reference?
MODULE_PARM_DESC(), MODULE_DESCRIPTION() and MODULE_AUTHOR() all appear to
be textual descriptions of parameters, the funciton of the module, and who
wrote it respectively. 
This appears to be information intended for the people loading the module.
How do people ever see this information? The only thing I can think of is to
do:
objdump --section=.modinfo --full-contents <fname>
The above command doesn't exactly seem like something a system adminstrator
would normally do.
Do any of these macros have an affect on module loading or use?
