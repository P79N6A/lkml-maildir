People who think that POSIX is the objective rather than the least 
common denominator of OS design have had their head screwed on backwards 
to better look at where their competitors used to be.
However, I agree that streams suck.  That is why reiser4 just has files 
and directories and not streams.  Our files and directories just happen 
to be able to do all that streams can do.
