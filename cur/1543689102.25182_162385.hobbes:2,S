Corruption is fixed in 2.6.0-test4.
Unfortunately it seems your IDE chipset doesnt support LBA48,
so you wont be able to access full capacity (137GB limit).
If you are ready to take a risk (again ;-) ) you can remove
"hwif->no_lba48 = ..." line from a drivers/ide/pci/alim15x3.c,
recompile and retest without using DMA (add "ide=nodma"
boot option).  Maybe LBA48 will work in PIO mode.
