Sorry for getting to this so late - I've only just started playing with 
this driver.

This is awkward. At the very least, year will be set to -1. This then 
gets passed through to rtc_tm_to_time, which results in reading 
wakealarm providing very odd feedback. I guess the "right" fix is for 
rtc_tm_to_time to use the current values for anything that's -1?

Do you really want to clobber RTC_AIE on probe? If an alarm has been set 
by the BIOS, it seems a little unfair to disable it on boot.
