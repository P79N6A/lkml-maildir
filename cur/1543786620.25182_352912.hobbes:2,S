SGI (and people "like" them) can't enable a debug option when bringing
up new changes for the first time on that huge system?  Why is this?
What in the world are all these CONFIG_*DEBUG* options for then?
They are there for "I'm doing something radically new, or my new
change isn't working, therefore I need more debugging than usual."
We want it to spam the logs, sure, during _development_.  We don't
want it on production systems where any kind of downtime is a very
serious problem.  Rate limited, maybe, but not for every call as
that's simply asking for trouble.
This is why we have things like net_ratelimit() in the networking btw.
It's there so you can't remotely spam someone's logs just becuase you
figured out the "bug of the week" magic packet that erroneously
generates a huge number of log messages.
If we know how to make certain classes of bugs non-lethal, we should
do so because there will always be bugs. :-)  This change makes
previously non-lethal bugs potentially kill the machine.
