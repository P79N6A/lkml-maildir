I am working on adding the capability to prioritize the input and output
network streams of the ipv4 implementation under linux.  To do this, I am
modifying the functions associated with struct sk_buff's in
include/linux/skbuff.h.  In my doings, I have run across the message 
"recvmsg bug copied <hex number here> <hex number here>" in
/var/log/messages.  Looking at the code for recvmsg.c in linux-2.2.9
(which is the version I am modifying), it looks like this is caused by the
fact that I have accidentally caused the system to process packets out of
sequence.  Is this correct or not?  Also, does anyone know of a way around
this or am I going to have to hack a way around it for the time being?
Any help would be appreciated.  This is for work on a project in partial
fulfillment of the degree of Master of Science in Computer Science.
Thanks muchly!
