The last time I spoke with Linus about this, what I understood can be
described in two points:
1) EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL is an hint: if you have to circumvent it, there are
high chances that you're creating a derivative of the linux kernel and
in turn there are high chances that you're illegal
2) The fact you're illegal or not, has nothing to do with the _GPL tag
in the exports, the illegal usage is when the module create a derivative
of the linux kernel.
Now I don't know for sure myself (I'm not a lawyer) what is a derivative
of the linux kernel (don't ask me), but the two above points are quite
clear to me. 
I always thought the _GPL tag could have no direct legal implications
and Linus confirmed it. The kernel is GPL so everyone can modify the
exports or re-export symbols as usual, the exports are GPL code too. The
guy who re-exports or remove a _GPL tag is just modifying a GPL code, so
he's ok.
The _GPL tag is useful as an hint to binary only vendors as as such it
makes perfect sense.
