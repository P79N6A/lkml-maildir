Well, you've shown both poles, where the correct licensing decision 
seems quite obvious. But in between there lies the great gray area,
where it's not so clear. Lets say you take a BSD driver and perform
a medium sized hack, eg add a new feature and include it into Linux
kernel. Now you've got code that has been mainly of appropriate *BSD
authorship, but with a reason for them (and the "evil corporations")
to want the change ported back. The final choice *is* to be made by
the author, it's the right way to be. What I suggest is to encourage
authors to share back, best done by maintainer asking to do so just
before committing.
