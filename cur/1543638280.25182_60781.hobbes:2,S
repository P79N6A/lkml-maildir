Lets not forgett that the code removed would allow to read behind the
partion in question and was broken therefore. However the real world
example from Petr worries me and makes me thinking that the partition
scanning time solution could turn out to be most adequate -> we have the
FAT partition ID there at hand and could adjust the partition
parameters in question properly with ease. Both of them: offset *and* size.
Petr would you mind dumping the dd=/dev/hdx count=10 of the
disk in question at me? Or do you preferr to go after this blotch
yourself?
