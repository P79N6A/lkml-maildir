Profiling uses the profil(2/3) utility here. It is not a system call
on Linux, so behaviour with regard to system calls might be surprising
(actually, it is a system call, but that does not work).  Instead, it
is a C library function implemented with standard system calls (see
glibc sources for details).
If you think this should change, please report that to the Linux
and/or glibc maintainers.

Martin
