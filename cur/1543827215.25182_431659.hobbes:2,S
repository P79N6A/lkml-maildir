Subject: [PATCH] RCU documentation: self-limiting updates and call_rcu()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/9/436

An update to the RCU documentation calling out the self-limiting-update-rate
advantages of synchronize_rcu(), and describing how to use call_rcu()
in a way that results in self-limiting updates.  Self-limiting updates
are important to avoiding RCU-induced OOM in face of denial-of-service
attacks.

+	it usually results in simpler code.  So, unless update
+	performance is critically important or the updaters cannot block,
+	synchronize_rcu() should be used in preference to call_rcu().
+
+	An especially important property of the synchronize_rcu()
+	primitive is that it automatically self-limits: if grace periods
+	are delayed for whatever reason, then the synchronize_rcu()
+	primitive will correspondingly delay updates.  In contrast,
+	code using call_rcu() should explicitly limit update rate in
+	cases where grace periods are delayed, as failing to do so can
+	result in excessive realtime latencies or even OOM conditions.
+
+	Ways of gaining this self-limiting property when using call_rcu()
+	include:
+
+	a.	Keeping a count of the number of data-structure elements
+		used by the RCU-protected data structure, including those
+		waiting for a grace period to elapse.  Enforce a limit
+		on this number, stalling updates as needed to allow
+		previously deferred frees to complete.
+
+		Alternatively, limit only the number awaiting deferred
+		free rather than the total number of elements.
+
+	b.	Limiting update rate.  For example, if updates occur only
+		once per hour, then no explicit rate limiting is required,
+		unless your system is already badly broken.  The dcache
+		subsystem takes this approach -- updates are guarded
+		by a global lock, limiting their rate.
+
+	c.	Trusted update -- if updates can only be done manually by
+		superuser or some other trusted user, then it might not
+		be necessary to automatically limit them.  The theory
+		here is that superuser already has lots of ways to crash
+		the machine.
+
+	d.	Use call_rcu_bh() rather than call_rcu(), in order to take
+		advantage of call_rcu_bh()'s faster grace periods.
+
+	e.	Periodically invoke synchronize_rcu(), permitting a limited
+		number of updates per grace period.
