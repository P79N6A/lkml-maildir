Oh, I was assuming that malloc(BIG) would do a mmap() of MAP_ANONYMOUS, 
which should make all the pages 100% shared, and thus basically zero cache 
overhead on a physically indexed machine like an x86. 
So it was designed to reall yonly stress the TLB, not the regular caches.
Although I have to admit that I didn't actually _test_ that hypothesis.
