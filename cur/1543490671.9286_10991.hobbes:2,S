What are you talking about then?  Any next-generation filesystem
designed for 64-bit file sizes is going to be best served by mapping
entire extents, not single blocks, in the mapping tree.  Preferably
the tree should be dynamically allocated and balanced (and if we want
to support file holes properly, it will _have_ to be balanced
dynamically).  In this case, the concept of quad-indirection as such
becomes meaningless.
