Because __mutex_lock_common() is the slow path.  The fast path is a
couple of assembly instructions in asm/mutex.h.  If the lock isn't
contended, it will never call __mutex_lock_common().
That would make the whole exercise rather pointless; the only time worth
spinning really is if you're the only other one waiting for it ... if
there's already a waiter, you might as well go to sleep.
