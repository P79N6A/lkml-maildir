I agree with Jan that it would be better to put this into scripts.
In the long term we could also detect some of the simple special cases, so we 
can finally inline some of these functions again, this would mean the 
generated file would go into include/linux/ and the script should be in 
scripts/.

I noticed this already in the old script, using something else than single 
letter variables would increase readability considerably.
