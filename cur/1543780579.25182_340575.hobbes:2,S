Sorry, unfortunately you are not right. See this (from man page for sigaction):
struct sigaction {
                   void (*sa_handler)(int);
                   void (*sa_sigaction)(int, siginfo_t *, void *);
                   sigset_t sa_mask;
                   int sa_flags;
                   void (*sa_restorer)(void);
               }
Please read the text about element sa_mask of struct sigaction to
understand what I'm talking about.
