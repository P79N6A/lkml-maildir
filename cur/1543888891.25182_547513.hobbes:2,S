Subject: [PATCH 1/3] Preserve the dirty bit in init_page_buffers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/21/599

The problem:  When we are trying to free buffers try_to_free_buffers
will look at ramdisk pages with clean buffer heads and remove the
dirty bit from the page.  Resulting in ramdisk pages with data that
get removed from the page cache.  Ouch!
Buffer heads appear on ramdisk pages when a filesystem calls getblk,
which through a series of function calls eventually calls
init_page_buffers. 
So to fix the mismatch between buffer head state and page state this
patch modifies init_page_buffers to transfer the dirty bit from the
page to the buffer heads like we currently do for the uptodate bit.
