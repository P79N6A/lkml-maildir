Hm, I don't think this interface will work for Xen.  In Xen, whenever a
pagetable page gets mapped, it must be mapped RO.  map_pt_hook gets
called after the mapping has already been created, so its too late for Xen.
I was planning on adding kmap_atomic_pte() for use in pte_offset_map*(),
which would be wired through to paravirt_ops to allow Xen to make this a
RO mapping.  Would this be sufficient for you to do your vmi thing?
