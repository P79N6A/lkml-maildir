The PS/2 erratic mouse bug has resurfaced again.
I thought 2.1.132 had fixed this problem.  However, today while
reading a large file from my CD-ROM drive, my mouse started jumping
around the screen and sending button-events to X.
I have a 34X drive and it was generating a lot of interrupt traffic,
streaming in data at what I guess was around 2MB/sec.
I can duplicate the test if anyone has patches or ideas.
BTW- This is 2.1.132 with Alan's second patch.
