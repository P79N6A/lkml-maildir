     Actually, with proper manipulation of sigaction, you get the
     restart behavior out of SunOS, and I believe most other UNICES as
     well. I think it is SA_RESTART or somesuch. I forget.
really? i thought the problem with SunOS 4 (and other older OSes like
ultrix) was the lack of SA_RESTART. at least that's why i still keep
checks for EINTR around.
