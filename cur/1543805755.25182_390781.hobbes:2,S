What about adding something like:
void s2ram_restore(void) {
        if (needed)
                fork_and_exec(vbetool);
}
machine_table could set a global flag or something. It would be
possibile to us an array to carry the informations about what need to be
done on restore, i.e. something like:
void machine_table() {
        if ((!strcmp(sys_vendor, "ASUS")) {
                if (!strcmp(sys_version, "My notebook")) {
                        machine_known();
                        on_resume[NEED_VBETOOL] = 1;
                        return;
                }
        }
}
void s2ram_restore(void) {
        if (on_resume[NEED_VBETOOL])
                fork_and_exec(vbetool);
        if (on_resume[NEED_RADEON_STUFF])
                radeon_stuff();
        if (on_resume[NEED_FOOBAR])
                black_magic();
}
Ugly? Maybe, but you don't have to fiddle with a x86 emulator.
