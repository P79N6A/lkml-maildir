Subject: spin locks and timers in scsi hba driver

Hi List,
I want to make sure that my hba-driver timers do run
when the uppar scsi-layer calls any of the error handler entry points
and while I am still doing the error handling. As I know, scsi-layer
calls spin_lock_irqsave(&io_request_lock, flags) before calling the
error handlers and they call spin_unlock_irqrestore(&io_request_lock, flags)
after returning from the error handlers. So, inside the error handlers,
I call spin_unlock_irq(&io_request_lock); wait for the timers to run,
and the again call spin_lock_irq(&io_request_lock). 
But this does not seem to be working. Even after I call
spin_unlock_irq(&io_request_lock), I don't see my timer routines getting
called.
Can somebody advise me on how to achive this ? I cannot use 
spin_unlock_irqrestore() as I do not have the saved 'flags' value.
TIA.
