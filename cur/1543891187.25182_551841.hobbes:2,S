Thanks,  I am wrong at seeing the delta variable is represented by 
virtual time unit. if the code does as I said, the delta_fair may be too 
small to meanless.
Also, I have want to know what's real meaning of     
    add_wait_runtime(rq, curr, delta_mine - delta_exec);
in update_curr(), IMHO, it should be
    add_wait_runtime(rq, curr, delta_mine - delta_fair);
Is this just another heuristics? or my opinion is wrong again? :-)
Good luck.
