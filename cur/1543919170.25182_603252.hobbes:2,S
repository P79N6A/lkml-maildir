Oddly enough, that's why I said "assuming PCI is present".  ;)
Anything using the ARC/TDI RTL doesn't have this issue ... it
includes full/low speed support directly, without a companion
controller.  That covers the Freescale silicon and some others.
For a long time I think that was the only generally available
non-PCI implementation.
But you're right that there are (now) a few other cases.
In-tree right now are also the Au1200, ps3, and 440epx.
