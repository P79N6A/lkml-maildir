Next time, please be so kind to fold your lines properly.
Now, if you a true hacker, you might want to give a whirl to this:
 
http://people.redhat.com/zaitcev/linux/linux-2.4.6-mallorn.diff
It certainly compiles, but does not work too well.
It may be a good start if you want to fix sparc(32).
Otherwise, forget it and use something else.
