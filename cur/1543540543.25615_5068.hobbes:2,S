Hi all
Does anyone know if there's a target mode SCSI driver for 
some SCSI adapter in Linux? I need something to 'fake' a 
SCSI-2 harddisk to create a storage solutiuon for some old 
proprietary so-called harddisk-recorders. These are used in 
sorts of studios to record and fiddle around with 
sound/music. These address harddisks connected to the SCSI 
bus in a per ID scheme, so "all I need to do" is sharing an 
network block device and 'connect' it to the SCSI via some 
cool interface.
The idea may seem absurd, though I hope there's something in 
there.. :-)
Roy
