I totally agree. This is the same reason I want to understand -why- it
fails with 3 stages. To make sure that adding a 4th stage really does fix
it, and doesn't just make the chances for the bug smaller.
I just have that funny feeling that we are band-aiding this for POWER with
extra stages and not really solving the bug.
I could be totally out in left field on this. But the more people have a
good understanding of what is happening (this includes why things fail)
the more people in general can trust this code.  Right now I'm thinking
you may be the only one that understands this code enough to trust it. I'm
just wanting you to help people like me to trust the code by understanding
and not just having faith in others.
If you ever decide to give up jogging, we need to make sure that there are
people here that can still fill those running shoes (-:
