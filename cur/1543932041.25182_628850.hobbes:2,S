I had this problem on Debian 4.0 and it was due to bug in the DSL
router.  I had DNS server set to 192.168.1.1 that is my DSL router
that holds the real DNS IP and forwards the DNS lookup request.
Once in a while the DNS proxy server will give out 1.0.0.0.  The
solution I used was to find the real DNS server and fill it in
resolv.conf  This avoids the DNS proxy on the router and then problem
went away.
