I'll try the explanation once more assuming you failed to understand the
previous messages in this thread and those linked to in the link I
provided to a thread about this.
Block devices have a "removable" flag. This flag is defined to indicate
devices where the media can change. A property of these devices is that
the device node and device stay around and media may or may not be
present at any one time. Examples of such devices are floppy and ide cd
drives.
When you remove a CF card, the controller is removed with the card and
nothing to do with the CF card or the device exists anymore. They are
therefore not removable devices in the linux definition of the term.
Currently the removable flag is set for CF cards. This is incorrect as a
CF device and interface either exists or doesn't. There is no media-less
state.
This incorrect setting causes loops with udev scripts requiring
userspace hacks to stop things looping. 
The patch therefore correctly sets the removable flag and removes some
unneeded code. 
This shouldn't break anything in userspace apart from anything that
incorrectly interprets the removable flag as being something its not.
