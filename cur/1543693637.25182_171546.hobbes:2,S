Not sure if I understand this one right - the dmesg was from the 
2.6.0-test6 kernel which did have ACPI HT-enum-only compiled in but no 
"local APIC support".
The 2.4.22 one that has the same problem does neither have ACPI nor APIC 
support compiled in - so no this doesn't seem to be the problem.

Yes - I really hope this will be fixed soon. I was forced to add a 
fiberchannel HBA into this maschine today to integrate it into our SAN 
to get the database up to speed again.
However I'm willing to move the database to the local disks again if you 
want me to test a patch or something along that line.
