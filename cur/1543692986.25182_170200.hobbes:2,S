Hi,
Just want to let you know ; kernel 2.6.0-test6 is very good compared to
2.4.6-test5 in terms of nearly everything, mainly the interactive
and play multimedia (mplayer). Big improvement! I will keep that one
run from now on :-)
And another good news is it allow me to record sound (snd-intel8x0)
before I posted a message that my card doesn't like recent alsa driver
but now it is resolved!
Best regards to you all
