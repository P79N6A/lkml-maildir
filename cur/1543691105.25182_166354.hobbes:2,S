Ok, I made an attempt to clean up this mess quite a while ago (2.5.47), 
but that patch is utterly useless now.  At Martin's urging I've created 
a new series of patches to resolve this.
01 - Make sure MAX_NUMNODES is defined in one and only one place. 
Remove superfluous definitions.  Instead of defining MAX_NUMNODES in 
asm/numnodes.h, we define NODES_SHIFT there.  Then in linux/mmzone.h we 
turn that NODES_SHIFT value into MAX_NUMNODES.
02 - Remove MAX_NR_NODES.  This value is only used in a couple of 
places, and it's incorrectly used in all those places as far as I can 
tell.  Replace with MAX_NUMNODES.  Create MAX_NODES_SHIFT and use this 
value to check NODES_SHIFT is appropriate.  A possible future patch 
should make MAX_NODES_SHIFT vary based on 32 vs. 64 bit archs.
03 - Fix up the sh arch.  sh defined NR_NODES, change sh to use standard 
MAX_NUMNODES instead.
04 - Fix up the arm arch.  This needs to be reviewed.  Relatively 
straightforward replacement of NR_NODES with standard MAX_NUMNODES.
05 - Fix up the ia64 arch.  This *definitely* needs to be reviewed. 
This code made my head hurt.  I think I may have gotten it right. 
Totally untested.
Cheers!
