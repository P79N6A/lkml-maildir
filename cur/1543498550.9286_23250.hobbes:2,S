Surely you meant to have a smiley face here somewhere?
$ echo e2fsck | sed 's/f*ck/darn/'
e2fsdarn
$ 
If not, you need to upgrade your "sed" to a version that works, because
yours doesn't.  In regular expressions, the '*' character says "zero or
more of the preceeding character", so "f*ck" would match "ck", "fck",
"ffck", "fffck", etc., but not "fsck".
