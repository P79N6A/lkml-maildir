Might want to do 'ls -lai' to get the inode numbers for . and .. and
then go sanity check them ('.' should have the same inode number as
lost+found/4207214, and '..' should have the same inode number as lost+found)
(and yes, I *know* fsck should whinge loudly if this is the case.  Wouldn't
be the first time I've seen an fsck fail to pick up on obvious corruption...)
