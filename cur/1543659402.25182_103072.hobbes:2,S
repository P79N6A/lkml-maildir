There is a well-defined procedure for this. Any "read" anywhere
in the PCI address space, will force all posted writes to complete.
However, the "read" will not be the data one would obtain after
the write completes. Therefore, to guarantee that all posted
writes complete before you read, for instance, status that could
be affected by that write, you execute a dummy read anywhere in
PCI address space, somewhere that will not screw up your
status. In other words, you don't read your device status twice,
once to post the writes and once to get the status because some
hardware will detect the read and fail to give you the correct
status on the second read. Instead, you read some 'harmless' register
that your hardware will decode, but not muck up the status. You
don't want to read a nonexistant register because this will cause
a lonnnnnnng bus-timeout. It will work to flush pending writes, but
it's slow.
