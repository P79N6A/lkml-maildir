Both are technically correct.  The original should be parsed (the field we
filled in) (in the struct).  The revision changes it to 'the field we filled'.
Probably should change, just to avoid 'Paris in the the spring' effects...

Again, should change, unless we want to emphasize "that *THAT* coherency
will be ordered" (as opposed to some other concurrenly applicable coherency).

Only by virtue of incredibly poor sentence structure originally.
"so the address of the card is put first." would be simpler and better.
