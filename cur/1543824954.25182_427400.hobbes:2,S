Ingo,
The 2.6.16-rt24 patch that you uploaded today will not apply cleanly to
a 2.6.16 source tree. Below is the first of many problems, if this helps.
patching file Documentation/DocBook/Makefile
patching file Documentation/RCU/whatisRCU.txt
patching file Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt
patching file Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt
can't find file to patch at input line 96
Perhaps you used the wrong -p or --strip option?
