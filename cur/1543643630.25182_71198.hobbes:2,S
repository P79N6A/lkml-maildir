Yep, There are even many other places where xtime is used which may result in 
the same kind of compilation problems. Two possible solutions come to mind:
* Maintain both the ordinary xtime (timeval) and an xtime_nsec (timespec). 
xtime may then be a timeval shadow value of xtime_nsec.
* Just fix it everywhere.
I cannot tell fore sure which option Linus prefers, but I think ...
Some places may even have other problems as well (e.g. ATM drivers): xtime is 
a complex data type which needs  read_lock / read_unlock, but there's no 
locking in many places.
