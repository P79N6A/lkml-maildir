Actually, that last part may be a red herring, since reiserfs_write_lock
is simply a macro for lock_kernel.  The more immediate concern is
avoiding the inode->i_op->getxattr call from SELinux on the xattr
directory inode.  reiserfs xattr code would need to call a new security
hook to mark the xattr root directory inode in some manner, so that
subsequent security_d_instantiate calls on the per-object subdirectories
could be identified by SELinux, and it could then just set the SID on
the incore inode to a well-defined value and not call
inode->i_op->getxattr for those inodes.
