Thanks Mikael, item 2) seems to be most reasonable. I did not know there 
are different APICs, though what's interesting is the line in 
kernel-parameters.txt
    noapic        [SMP,APIC] Tells the kernel not to make use of any
            APIC that may be present on the system.
Note: not to make use of _ANY_ APIC that may be present......
I would suggest either "noapic" should turn off ALL APICs as is 
described in the doc or fix the doc. Personally I like fist option 
better though second is much simplier.
