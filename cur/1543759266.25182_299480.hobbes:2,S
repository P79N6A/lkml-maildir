I've found the arm cross compiler generated from openembedded 
(
http://openembedded.org
) to be very reliable. The big advantage in using oe 
would be that it is in active use so it is always highly likely to generate 
a working compiler. Someone just needs to make it generate a 
toolchain/compiler for external use[1], make it available somewhere and 
advertise the fact its available. Generation of the toolchain could probably 
be almost entirely automated.
Fixes for any problems with compiler would be more than welcome for 
incorporation into oe short term and for submission upstream for "proper" 
fixing.
[1] I think I've seen reference that it can already do this...
