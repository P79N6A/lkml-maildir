I think we're repeatedly iterating over the same zones by walking the 
zonelists:
static unsigned int nr_free_zone_pages(int offset)
{
        pg_data_t *pgdat;
        unsigned int sum = 0;
        int i;
        for_each_pgdat(pgdat) {
                struct zone *zone;
                for (i = 0; i < MAX_NR_ZONES; i++) {
                        unsigned long size, high;
                        zone = pgdat->node_zones[i];
                        size = zone->present_pages;
                        high = zone->pages_high;
                        if (size > high)
                                sum += size - high;
                }
        }
}
Does that look more sensible? I'd send you a real patch, except the
box just crashed ;-)
