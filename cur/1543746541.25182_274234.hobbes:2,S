I was going to say, set the netmask small enough so that both
machines are on different networks and set default routes to
your gateway.... But there is a bug somewhere that doesn't
allow a netmask of anything but 0 in the last byte.
So, just add a host route....
route add -host 10.0.1.2 gw server

FYI, probably nobody will admit to it being a bug, but it's
another example of policy spreading throughout the kernel.
If I set the netmask to 0.0.0.0 or 255.255.255.255, and
anything in-between, it should let me....
