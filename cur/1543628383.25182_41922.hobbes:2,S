Here are my 2 cent:
	- The BIOS screws up (at least) ATI Radeon cards (their fonts)
	- The newest versions (at least 2.09 and 2.10) require to press
	  F1 if you use non-MP Athlons
	- The newest BIOS version (2.10) does __not__ mention a second
	  CPU in the MP table if you use non-MP Athlons. This means that
	  basically the board unconditionally boots up with only __one__
	  CPU, even if you press F1 to accept a non-supported mode.
	- I've added an additional SCSI card. The box didn't come up
	  because this additional card was bootable. I had to remove the
	  boot ROM of that card.
My conclusions:
	- Basically, the board is *very* nice. Two Athlons, two U/160
	  SCSI channels, lots of ECC-protected RAM.
	- BIOS is quite bad. It feels like being unready and is quite
	  unfriendly to not officially supported (non-MP) dual Athlons.
	  Despite that, there are problems with lots of other hardware
	  (ATI Radeon cards, additional bootable SCSI cards, ...).
