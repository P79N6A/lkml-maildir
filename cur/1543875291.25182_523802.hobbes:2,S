You've got this the wrong way round.  mincore should succeed in
these cases: just like munmap, mprotect, msync, madvise etc do.

NAK, sorry.

Please follow that up with the LTP guys: I expect they'll quickly
agree that the test is wrong and correct it.
It probably dates from when mmap addresses were commonly allocated in
ascending order, whereas now they're commonly allocated in descending
order: neither being a rule, neither to be assumed.  (Ah, I see Nick
has already suggested this memory layout issue to you.)
Another thing to keep in mind is that 2.6.21-rc fixes mincore to
succeed on anonymous areas, where before it failed for no very good
reason.  That can't be the issue here, since your report is against
earlier releases; but it is something for the test fixer to note.
Thanks,
Hugh
