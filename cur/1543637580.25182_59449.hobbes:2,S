Because its an external API it needs to remain constant. Swapping
uchar/uint looks fine and the structure is off the drive anyway. However
they should be __u16 __u8 __u32 so that C libraries and apps can still
use the header (its __u16 because 'u16' cannot be exposed to user space
directly or via libc)
