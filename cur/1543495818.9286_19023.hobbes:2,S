I know I'm not a kernel developer, but I might have some ideas...  I my self
have wanted to see the irq's listed that weren't currently in use.
I have a question tho.  back in the 2.0 days, what was the + for in the
interrupts?  This machine below has 2.0.36:
 0: 1104087408   timer
 1:     538377   keyboard
 2:          0   cascade
 9:    6704638   xirc2ps_cs
11:        142   i82365
12:    3263094   PS/2 Mouse
13:          1   math error
14:    9763449 + ide0
               ^
If this doesn't break anything, maybe you can put a - in that place (I don't
guess 2.2 uses it since the other 3 machines I have are using 2.2 and
doesn't show the +) to indicate that it's a non active irq.

Maybe my idea will help...  Too bad I'm not very good at modifing other
peoples code.  (I even have problems with my own if I haven't worked with it
in a while <g>)
