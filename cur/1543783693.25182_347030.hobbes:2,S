It seems to me that one should write an ATA-specific Device Mapper 
driver, which layers on top of an ATA disk.  The driver obtains the 
starting location of HPA, then exports two block devices:  one for the 
primary data area, and one for the HPA.
For situations where we want the start Linux philosophy -- Linux exports 
100% of the hardware capability -- no DM layer needs to be used.  For 
situations where its better to treat the HPA as a separate and distinct 
area, the DM driver would come in handy.
This follows the same philosophy as fakeraid (BIOS RAID):  we simply 
export the entire disk, and Device Mapper (google for 'dmraid') handles 
the vendor-proprietary RAID metadata.
