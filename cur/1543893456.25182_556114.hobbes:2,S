I'm not going to defend it too much, but the alternatives don't seem any
better to me.

Doesn't matter - the casting will preserve the value.  Of greater
concern is the relationship between sizeof(void *) and sizeof(long).
That's not guaranteed by the standard, but is by gcc.

Which ones?

No, that trades the global variable for a new point of failure.
The main reason I like the current casting better than your global
(not by a lot) is that globals have to be audited for SMP safety.  So,
I don't want any globals which don't need to be.  This implies a
local, and to minimize the machinery associated with that (kmalloc, or
passing a pointer and synchronizing to avoid returning too soon), just
passing the descriptor in the pointer and accepting the casting needed
to get it through the compiler.
