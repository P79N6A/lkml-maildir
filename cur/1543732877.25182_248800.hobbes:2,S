So now I'm wondering if there's a way to coerce the libata drivers to generate
this?

I read somewhere that the current generation of SATA drives from everyone
except Seagate were really PATA with a "bridge". It sounded like BS to me, but
is that why they're behaving like PATA drives as far as these error codes? Or
is it simply a question of the shared firmware codebase?
