This test was actually using 2.1.4, but the only difference in the 2.1.5 
version is a fix for the test label array for the aio versions of the 
test.  No functional change, just fixed the outputed test description.

rawread -t6 -p8 -m1 -d2 -s4096 -n65536 -l1 -z -x
Which you can find if you follow either results link and look in the 
benchmark directory where all raw benchmark out put is stored.
