Leave this decision to distributors. Ubuntu already seem to use (and require 
you to install) gcc 3.4 if you want to recompile their kernel or any kernel 
modules. It ships with 4.0.1, iirc.
I see GCC improving currently. 3.0 was horrendously slow and buggy versus 
2.95, but 3.3 was a very good compiler, and 4.1 looks like it will be even 
better. Maybe things will continue to improve and this will become less of an 
issue over time.
