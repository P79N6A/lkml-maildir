Yes, the starvation issue is potentially real. And thinking about it,
we've even had that in real life, with /proc and lots of page faults. So I
guess that's a strong argument for the fairness thing.
Oh, well. The reason I hate the rwsem behaviour is exactly because it
results in this very subtle class of deadlocks. This one case is certainly
solvable several ways, but do we have other issues somewhere else? Things
like kobject might be ripe with things like this. The mm semaphore tends
to be pretty well-behaved - and I'm not sure the same is true of the
kobject one.
Normal recursive deadlocks are wonderful - most of them show up
immediately, so assuming you just have enough coverage, you're fine. This
fairness-related deadlock requires a race to happen.
Maybe it would be sufficient to have a debugging version of rwsems that
just notice recursion?
