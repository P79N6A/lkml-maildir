Quite a lot of work indeed, and it would force to convert 3 int (nr_files, 
nr_free_files, max_files) to 3 atomic_t. I feel bad introducing a lot of 
sysctl rework for a tiny change (removing filp_count_lock)

That's true, and the difference can be relatively important in case of preemption.
Each time the true and correct value  (atomic_nr_files) is updated, a copy is 
done on nr_files : as nr_files is only used to be a guard value against too 
many file allocations, a somewhat 'lazy' value has no impact at all.
