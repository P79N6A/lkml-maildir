So why isn't it feasible to keep truncate algorithms and pagecache code
separated while collapsing the rest?  Same logic as i said in another reply:
if (journaled)
~  extfs_journaled_truncate();
else
~  extfs_nonjournaled_truncate();

I understand this; but all work done is volunteer, so it'll only get
done if someone wants to do it :)
