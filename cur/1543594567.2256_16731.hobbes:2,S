getrusage() isn't really the system call you want for this.
There is a max RSS value, which linux could support but doesn't, but
you seem to want to see the current RSS over time.  Search the archive
for various patches/complaints about getrusage.
For vsize, most OSes offer time-integral averages of text, data, and
stack sizes via getrusage().  Again, more of an aggregate than a current
snapshot, and again, linux returns zero for these currently.
