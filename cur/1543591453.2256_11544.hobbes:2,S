I used to get NETDEV WATCHDOG eth0:timeout error on 
Alpha SMP, too, with the tulip card.  Definitely, Alpha
has nothing to do with the x86 APIC.  Since then, I switched to
3C905B.
I suspect that NETDEV WATCHDOG error covers a broad class of 
network errors.
Does anyone know more about this?
Thank you
