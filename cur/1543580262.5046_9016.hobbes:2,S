Can you try 2.4.0?  Are you using the 3c59x ethernet driver?  I've got the 
same problem on one of my machines, (see message with subject "2.4.1-pre10 
-> 2.4.1 klogd at 100% CPU ; 2.4.0 OK") and the last thing that is logged 
is a message from the 3c59x ethernet driver.
I'm doing a bit more digging to see what changed in the driver between 
revisions.  /proc/pci lists my 3c905B as this:
3Com Corporation 3c905B 100BaseTX [Cyclone] (rev 48)
