This release includes user selection in top, the sysctl -e
option needed to support the Red Hat 8.0 boot scripts, and
the use of /proc/*/wchan on recent 2.5.xx kernels.
For those of you still upgrading from procps 2.0.xx releases,
you can expect:
* top can sort by any column (old sort keys available too)
* top can select a single user to display
* top can be put in multi-window mode and/or color mode
* vmstat has the -s option, as found on UNIX and BSD systems
* vmstat has the -f option, as found on UNIX and BSD systems
* watch doesn't eat the first blank line by mistake
* vmstat uses a fast O(1) algorithm on 2.5.xx kernels
* pmap command is SunOS-compatible
* vmstat shows IO-wait time
* pgrep and pkill can find the oldest matching process
* sysctl handles the Linux 2.5.xx VLAN interfaces
* top shows IO-wait time if-and-only-if your kernel computes it
* most programs 30% to 300% faster (tested on a 450 MHz MPC7400)
* ps has a new "-F" format (very nice, like DYNIX/ptx has)
* ps with proper BSD process selection
* better handling of very long uptimes
There's a procps-feedback@lists.sf.net mailing list you can
use for feature requests, bug reports, and so on. Use it!
Feedback makes things happen.
