With the VLAN stuff that suddenly appeared, I did some large packet 
testing...  I would typically cap the MTU limit at just under the FIFO 
size, since it often requires special handling doing frames > FIFO size.
I do not look forward to re-verifying the 2.4 tulip driver across all 
those chipsets, to make sure my large packet code [which is not yet in 
the kernel] works. :)
