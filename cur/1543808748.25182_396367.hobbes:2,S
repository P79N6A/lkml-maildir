This is true for software suspend, but not for hardware suspend (see  
the differences now?)  This is why the two are independent and should  
not be mashed together into one "Generic Suspend".  Let me bring up  
the example of my PowerBook again.  It's RAM is fully powered right  
now, running from battery, and it has another couple days of sleep- 
charge left before I have to worry about plugging it in again.  When  
I open it, the firmware automatically powers up the CPU and other  
hardware and returns control to the OS.  I can _also_ trigger it to  
wake by leaving it closed and connecting an external VGA and USB (it  
wakes every time I connect a USB, but my suspend script puts it to  
sleep again if it's closed and has no external VGA).

You don't need the CPU, just a good USB controller and hubs with low- 
power modes and such.  The fact that plugging in a USB keyboard/mouse  
and a VGA monitor is enough to wake the system when properly  
configured should be proof enough.

Sometimes not, but again, it depends on the hardware.
