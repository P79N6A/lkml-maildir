Or you could dig LKML archives - I reported it in jan & feb three times.

wli has a patch, unfortunately for some reason it did not hit
main kernel yet. I've put it (without Wli's permission) at 
http://platan.vc.cvut.cz/ftp/pub/linux/pidstat.patch.
For unknown reason patch did not find its way to Linus's kernel yet,
although it renders 2.6.x unusable in any multiuser environment.

I have simple C program which you run under normal account on any
2.6.x kernel and it will turn box into dead piece of metal if SMP
kernel is used, or at least all 'ps' services stop (on UP kernel).
Not useful as exploit, but quite sufficient as a DoS.
