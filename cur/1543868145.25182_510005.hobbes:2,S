+/*
+ * UBI wear-leveling unit.
+ *
+ * This unit is responsible for wear-leveling. This unit works in terms of
+ * physical eraseblocks and erase counters and knows nothing about logical
+ * eraseblocks, volumes, etc (with one exception). From this unit's perspective
+ * all physical eraseblocks are of two types - used and free. Used physical
+ * eraseblocks are those that were "get" by the 'ubi_wl_get_peb()' function,
+ * and free physical eraseblocks are those that were put by the
+ * 'ubi_wl_put_peb()' function. Actually, the above two functions are the main
+ * in this unit.
+ *
+ * Physical eraseblocks returned by 'ubi_wl_get_peb()' have only the erase
+ * counter header. The rest of the physical eraseblock contains only 0xFF bytes.
+ *
+ * When physical eraseblocks are returned to the WL unit by means of the
+ * 'ubi_wl_put_peb()' function, they are scheduled for erasure. The erasure is
+ * not done synchronously. Instead, it is done in background in context of the
+ * per-UBI device background thread (see the background thread unit). Actually,
+ * the WL unit strongly depends on the background thread and cannot operate
+ * without it.
+ *
+ * The wear-leveling is ensured by means of moving the contents of used
+ * physical eraseblocks with low erase counter to free physical eraseblocks
+ * with high erase counter. The movement is also done in background.
+ *
+ * When eraseblocks are moved, the WL unit cooperates with the EBA unit to
+ * provide proper eraseblock locking. This means, the WL unit uses the EBA unit
+ * to lock the logical eraseblock corresponding to the physical eraseblock
+ * which is being moved. This is the only place where the WL unit "knows" about
+ * logical eraseblocks and volume identifier headers.
+ *
+ * The 'ubi_wl_get_peb()' function accepts data type hints which help to pick
+ * an "optimal" physical eraseblock. Indeed, for example, when it knows that
+ * the physical eraseblock will be "put" soon, it may pick a free physical
+ * eraseblock with low erase counter, and so forth.
+ *
+ * If the WL unit fails to erase a physical eraseblock, it marks the physical
+ * eraseblock as bad (using the bad eraseblock handling unit).
+ *
+ * This unit is also responsible for scrubbing. If a bit-flip is detected in a
+ * physical eraseblock, it has to be moved. Technically this is the same as
+ * moving it for wear-leveling reasons.
+ *
+ * As it was said, for the UBI unit all physical eraseblocks are either "free"
+ * or "used". Free eraseblock are kept in the @wl->free RB-tree, while used
+ * eraseblocks are kept in a set of different RB-trees: @wl->used,
+ * @wl->prot.pnum, @wl->prot.aec, and @wl->scrub.
+ *
+ * Note, in this implementation, we keep a small in-RAM object for each physical
+ * eraseblock. This is surely not a scalable solution. But it appears to be good
+ * enough for moderately large flashes and it is simple. In future, one may
+ * re-work this unit and make it more scalable.

+ *
+ * When the WL unit returns a physical eraseblock, the physical eraseblock is

+ * eraseblock is not directly moved from the @wl->free tree to the @wl->used
+ * tree. There is one more tree in between where this physical eraseblock is
+ * temporarily stored (@wl->prot).
+ *
+ * All this protection stuff is needed because:
+ *  o we don't want to move physical eraseblocks just after we have given them
+ *    to the user; instead, we first want to let users fill them up with data;
+ *
+ *  o there is a chance that the user will put the physical eraseblock very
+ *    soon, so it makes sense not to move it for some time, but wait; this is
+ *    especially important in case of "short term" physical eraseblocks.
+ *
+ * Physical eraseblocks stay protected only for limited time. But the "time" is
+ * measured in erase cycles in this case. This is implemented with help of the

+ *
+ * Protected physical eraseblocks are searched by physical eraseblock number
+ * (when they are put) and by the absolute erase counter (to check if it is
+ * time to move them to the @wl->used tree). So there are actually 2 RB-trees
+ * storing the protected physical eraseblocks: @wl->prot.pnum and
+ * @wl->prot.aec. They are referred to as the "protection" trees. The
