CPU's? well, we do have a nice sheduler but i wouldn't say network-like
queuing.

Yes, but, thats not what I'm saying.
CFQ as it apparently was called, builds a queue list when the disk is
under load. So you get really fast data access if there is no load, and
a common queue when there is load. The common queue is the bad thing
about CFQ, imagine putting AS there instead... This would mean fast data
access on unloaded systems, better throughput on loaded systems and
prioritization features could hook right in since AS would only be used
during load. IE, you can add all kinds of patches that only matters
during heavy load.
(note: load is only diskload)
