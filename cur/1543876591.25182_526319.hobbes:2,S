I thought this was important for vmlinux and Xen?
I guess at this point the easy case is that we modify /sbin/kexec to support
it.  And the other bootloaders can come be upgraded if the feature is
interesting enough.

Agreed.  We do have CONFIG_PHYSICAL_ALIGN that can handle that case,
although I admit that is a bit of a hack.

I think something like CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START currently gives us very
little gain, and is hard to use correctly, and there are alternative
solutions.  So if we can get rid of it, by only inconveniencing users
who want load their kernels at a weird address it is worth it.

Yes.  For x86_64 I can do this.  i386 is more difficult.  (Although with
a little cleverness we can move the code that processes relocations into
vmlinux).
