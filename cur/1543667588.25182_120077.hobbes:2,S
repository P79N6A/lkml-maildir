Thanks for doing this.

Yes, we do.  But.

Oh shit, we're toast.
How many partitions did these "disks" have?

Yes, that will take some work.  What I would do is to change kmalloc:
+ int foo;
  kmalloc(...)
  {
+	if (foo)
+		dump_stack();
and then set `foo' in gdb across the registration of one disk.
Probably you can set foo by hand in scsi_register_device() or wherever it
happens.
