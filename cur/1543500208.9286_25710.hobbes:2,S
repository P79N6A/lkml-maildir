That wasn't my case. Technically I could run safe also in the old way
simply replacing the:
	free_page()
	{
		if (last_reference)
		{
			if (locked)
				Oops();
		}
	}
with:
	free_page()
	{
		if (last_reference)
		{
			if (locked)
				unlock();
		}
	}
but I was looking only my specific case, and now that I see the whole
picture I agree that in general is far better to forbid a locked page to
be freed (and it's also more efficient :).
