Hi there,
My machine is a 2-Processor Pentium 4 (Xeon) 2.4GHz e7500 Chipset with 4GB RAM.
I installed Redhat (kernel: Linux 2.4.18-10bigmem) on it. 
But when I run following piece of code:
========================================
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
int main(){
   mmap ((void *) 1090519040, 17000000,
         PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC,
         MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_FIXED, -1, 0);
}
===========================================
It gives out "segmentation fault". It works well if I change 17000000
to 16000000.
I have tried Linux 2.4.18-10smp kernel, same problem.
Is there anyone have any idea what's going on here? Or do you have any
recommendation that which version of Linux I should use for my machine to work
around this problem?
Thanks a lot!
Lingli
