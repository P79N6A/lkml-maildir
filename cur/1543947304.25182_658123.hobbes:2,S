Hi,
Trying out 2.6.25-rc2 smartd always causes my box to hang. I can switch 
vt:s and the keyboard seems to work.
Using sysrq-e I noticed a callpath open -> ext3 -> journals -> sync_buffer -> 
io_scheduel -> generic_unplig_device.
I'd guess the open stems from smartd. Removing smartd from the startup, I'm 
now using rc2 fine...
I got a nice jpg showing it as well.
Known issue?
