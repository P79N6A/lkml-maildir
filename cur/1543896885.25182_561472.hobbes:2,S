The following patch series contains:
- dyntick bugfixes for -mm (caused by the cpuidle changes in ACPI)
- updates and improvements to high resolution timer / dynticks 
- high resolution timer / dynticks support for x86_64
The x86_64 support is based on an initial patch from Chris Wright. Thanks Chris !
The overall diffstat of the patchset is:
 50 files changed, 843 insertions(+), 1477 deletions(-)
The patch set has been tested in the -hrt and -rt trees for quite a while
and the initial problems have been sorted out. Thanks to the folks from the
PowerTop project for testing and feedback.
Changes since V2:
- dropped clocksource settimeofday hook for PPC
- fixed compile breakage of vmiclock
- coding style fixups
- better patch split
The patch series is also available from the hrtimers project site:

series from Venki.
Thanks,
