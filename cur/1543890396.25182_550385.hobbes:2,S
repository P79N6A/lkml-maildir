I've looked at that code and it seems to need that file for one constant. 
Perhaps it'd be better for jffs2/compr_zlib.c to define that constant itself 
(or use it as a "Magic Number") rather than include the zlib private header. 
Another possibility would be to move that constant out of zutil.h and into 
zconf.h or zlih.b - doing any of those would allow the zlib private header to 
be moved such that zlib could be changed to use a common directory *and* have 
said private header in that directory.
