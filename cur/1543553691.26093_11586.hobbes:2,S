You will need to use a function pointer hook that the module fills in
when it is loaded.  For an example look at devpts_upcall_new and
devpts_upcall_kill in fs/devpts/inode.c.  The hooks are resident in the
kernel and are exported so the module can see them.  The caller then
needs to check if the hook is null and optionally request the module be
loaded.
