Subject: [PATCH 000 of 4] knfsd: fixes and enhancements for 2.6.21
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Following are 4 patchs from knfsd suitable for 2.6.21.
Numbers 3 and 4 provide new usability features that require a new
nfs-utils to make full use of (all nfs-utils will ofcourse continue to
work providing the functionality it always provided).
(3) allows a 16 byte uuid to be used to identify the filesystem rather
than the device id (which is volatile) or a 32bit number (which has to
be managed manually).  nfs-utils used libblkid to extract a uuid from
most filesystems. (Thanks Trond for reviewing this code - I hope you
like the changes).
(4) allows an upcall to be made to map a 'uid' to a list of 'gids'.
The AUTH_UNIX authentication protocol only carries 16 group ids which
causes problems for people with more than 16 group ids.
 [PATCH 001 of 4] knfsd: Fix return value for writes to some files in 'nfsd' filesystem.
 [PATCH 002 of 4] knfsd: Tidy up choice of filesystem-identifier when creating a filehandle.
 [PATCH 003 of 4] knfsd: Add some new fsid types.
 [PATCH 004 of 4] knfsd: Allow the server to provide a gid list when using AUTH_UNIX authentication.
