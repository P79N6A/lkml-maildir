Yes, this helps.  It sets the offending IRQ to be level triggered, so
the wireless card works nicely.
My only concern is that dmesg contains:
[354446.223241] PCI: Using IRQ router PIIX/ICH [8086/7110] at 0000:00:07.0
[354446.223302] PCI: IRQ 0 for device 0000:00:04.0 doesn't match PIRQ mask - try
 pci=usepirqmask
[354446.223363] PCI: setting IRQ 0 as level-triggered
[354446.223401] PCI: Found IRQ 10 for device 0000:00:04.0
[354446.223446] PCI: Sharing IRQ 10 with 0000:00:04.1
Setting IRQ 0 to level-triggered doesn't seem healthy as it is the
timer interrupt.
It definitely gets IRQ 10 (the problematic one - 0:04 is the PCMCIA
controller) and IRQ 11 (which was already level-triggered).
e.g.
[354446.228016] PCI: setting IRQ 10 as level-triggered
[354446.228060] PCI: Found IRQ 10 for device 0000:00:04.0
[354446.228140] PCI: Sharing IRQ 10 with 0000:00:04.1
[354446.228218] PCI: Found IRQ 10 for device 0000:00:04.1
[354446.228268] PCI: Sharing IRQ 10 with 0000:00:04.0
A subsequent printout of the ELCR show the two bytes to be
 00 and 0c
representing IRQ10 and IRQ11 - so it seems the setting of IRQ-0 to
level triggered didn't have a lasting effect.
Maybe the eisa_set_level_irq should be passed 'irq' rather than
'newirq' ??
