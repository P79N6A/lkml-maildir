I didn't have any particular objection to it. With ->age in there
the unsigned char didn't make a difference and it perhaps looked
cleaner.

I still have my old code sitting around that I could quickly
resurrect to provide this. I can integrate it and send it to
you for review if that would help.
I don't really care one way or the other about whether my original
implementation is reused so much as preventing my inaction from
delaying the merge. The difference is just trivial.
Cheers,
Bill
