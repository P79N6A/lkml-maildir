Hi,
I'm working on an s3c2410 and I notice that in the kernel there is not a
function to read the bus mode of the arm920t. The kernel may fail to
report the correct frequencies of the core to the user level. It can
read the cp15 register to show the core frequency that can be taken from
the amba bus or the flck.
Regards Michael
