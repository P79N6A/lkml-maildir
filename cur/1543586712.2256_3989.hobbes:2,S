VMware is working on implementation PCnet 32bit mode in emulation (there
is no such thing now because of no OS except FreeBSD needs it). But
my question is - is there some real benefit in running chip in
32bit mode? All registers except CSR88 use only low 16 bits anyway,
so is 32bit mode needed for bigendian ports, or what's reasoning
behind it? AFAIK all chips support 16bit mode, and having only 16bit
mode in code could save at least one indirect jump on each chip access.
