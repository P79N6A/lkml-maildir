yeah, the only differene here is that x86_64 performs a hell of a lot
better in 99% of cases where a 32 bit compile performs next to a 64 bit
compile. In the case of the other architectures the 64 bit modes are
extensions of sorts, used for scientific and/or large calculations which
benefit from 64-bit datatypes and transactions.

Alpha was designed 64-bit from the start. DEC did a lot of neat things
with the design of that processor -- it's a shame it went the way of the
dodo when ia64 was proposed.

Fun stuff. Another good architecture that bit the ia64 bug and got
stung.
