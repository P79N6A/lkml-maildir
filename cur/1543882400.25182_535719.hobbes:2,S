Not so fast. The x86-64 ABI may allow any power of two size between
4KB and 64KB, but the emulated i386 ABI does not.

There's a little more to it than that, plus i386 ABI emulation.

It does not resemble 3-level vs. 2-level pagetable format code. It
can be done entirely in arch code if you don't care to emulate the
i386 ABI.

I'll clean up what I have and post it at some point.

mmap() should be emulatable with the base page size without anything
interesting happening. Of course, there are opportunities for more, if
anyone cares to take them.
