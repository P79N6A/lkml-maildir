Subject: Repeated kernel oops from 2.2.{5,7} router

This is a serious, reproduceable problem.  In short, I'm working from
behind a 486 Linux router which is configured to do IP Masqing, kernel
port forwarding, and lots of other neat things I'm thankful for.
Unfortunately, it can't seem to do all of them right now without
crashing.  Although IP Masqing for HTTP connections seems to be
working fine, I can't keep an ssh connection to the outside world open
for more than a few minutes before the router crashes with an oops on
the screen.  This happens with both 2.2.5 and 2.2.7.
Here's what I've got out of (my first time using) ksymoops:
[root@app OOPS-2.2.7]# ../ksymoops -v vmlinux -o 2.2.7/ -K -L -M <
oopsfile
Options used: -v vmlinux (specified)

              -M (specified)

Aiee, killing interrupt handler
Kernel panic: Attempted to kill the idle task!
In swapper task - not syncing

It looks like it's dying in the scheduler, but it's not just a
scheduler problem - the system stays up for days on end (under almost
no load, but still) when there isn't an open IPMasqed connection.  I
also can't explain why web browsing out through the router works but
open ssh connections cause a crash.
I hope this is enough info to be useful - I can provide info from
route, ipchains, or anything else upon request... and like I said,
this is repeatable.
