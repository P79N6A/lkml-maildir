When using ethernet bonding, does it divide the load between the
two based on connection, or packet by packet?  In other words, if
a single TCP connection were established between the two
machines, would it be twice as fast -using both cables for a
single file transfer lets say, or is it like SMP where it just
means you can have twice as many connections, and any given
connection would go only through a single cable, but multiple
traffic will be load balanced between both?
