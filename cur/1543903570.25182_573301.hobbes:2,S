the intent was not to have one global call that sets the mode on all 
devices, but rather have one call for each device/subsystem, just the same 
call in each case.
there's also nothing that says that there can only be one thing setting 
the mode (although that does mean a fourth call 'report_current_mode()' or 
similar is needed). and if you choose to have two pieces of software 
managing the same device things could get 'interesting'.
as for the speed that such decisions need to be made.
this API is not saying anything about the speed of the decisions.
it's also not saying anything about if the decision makeing is being done 
by kernelspace or userspace. it's just providing a common way for whatever 
software is doing the decision makeing to find out it's options and set 
the modes.
one way to represent this in sysfs (as a possible userspace API) would be
power/mode (read to see what mode the device is in, write to set the mode)
power/modelist
power/switching_delay (outputs the delay matrix showing the cost of switching from mode to mode)
although I'm not sure how you would allow the system to report an error 
this way.
if you have the ondemand governer running, it uses these API's to make 
it's changes, but if you didn't want to run the ondemand governer you 
could just do course speed settings through sysfs.

I'm proposing a single function name per device, not a single function for 
the entire system.
