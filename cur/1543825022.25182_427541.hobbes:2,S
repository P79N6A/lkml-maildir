Subject: [PATCH 2.6.17-rc5 0/7] Kernel memory leak detector 0.2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/27/46

This is a new version (0.2) of the kernel memory leak detector based
on the tracing garbage collection technique. See the
Documentation/kmemleak.txt file for a more detailed description. The
patches are also available from
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/cmarinas/kmemleak/.
Thanks to all who contributed useful suggestions for these patches.
What's new in this version:
- cleaned up the code according to the suggestions on LKML
- implemented the buffering of allocation/freeing calls before
  kmemleak is properly initialised (many allocations would be missed
  without this feature)
- moved the pointer leaks information from /proc/memleak to
  /sys/kernel/debug/memleak (debugfs)
- the task stacks are not scanned by default because this can lead
  to many false negatives
- fixed the locking and tested on SMP (ARM)
- fixed other bugs
To do:
- better testing
- better support for modules (module static variables, new pointer
  aliases found in modules)
- test Ingo's suggestion on task stack scanning
- NUMA support
