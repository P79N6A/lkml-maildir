I am sure who the following patch should be directed to.
(I couldn't find the Maintainer for RAM disk or initrd listed in the 
Maintainers file.)
Change to Kconfig text for RAM disks where suggested setting was N.
Now reminds the user that this option is required for initrd.
Hopefully this will stop me turning off this option and thus being unable to 
boot my system :-)
