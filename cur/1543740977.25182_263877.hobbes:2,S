You can write a specification, but I can guarantee you that
it will be out of date the moment you run your spell checker
on it.
Linux kernel development continues at a very high speed, and
things inside the kernel change all the time.  The only thing
that's stable is the user space ABI (the system calls), since
the behaviour of those (mostly) follows POSIX and the Single
Unix Standard (SUS).
