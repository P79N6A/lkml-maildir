I dont care much about having gcc 3.5 work on v2.4 right now. Right now I think 
we wont ever care about supporting it.
gcc 3.4 is more a of a concern because there is demand for it - Mikael has been
maintaining the patches out-of-the-tree for sometime now and I received
quite some reports about them (ie there is pressure for that).
But, due to the v2.4 state of life (bugfix mode only), I've been very annoyed 
by these patches already. Uninliningfunctions is the most annoying thing 
to me.
It doenst make sense for it (v2.4) to work on new-shiny-gcc next generation, v2.6/2.7 
are there to support those.
