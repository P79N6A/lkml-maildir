Neil's patch is required, and since it's not in 2.6.15-rc we might still 
get bug reports with 4k stacks that are fixed by his patch.
Do we have any bug reports due to 4k stacks against -mm since Neil's 
patch was included?
People were able to convince me in the past to delay my patch to always 
use 4k stacks by pointing to unsolved problems (or I pointed them like 
in the reiser4 case) - and these were constructive delays since the code 
was fixed. So if someone wants to convince me that it's too early for my 
patch, simply send me some pointers to 4k stack issues still present in 
a recent -mm.  :-)
Hm, I just found two serious stack usage regressions in 2.6.15-rc (bug 
report will be in a separate email), but allocating arrays with more 
than 2000 elements on the stack is always wrong in the kernel 
independent of the stack size...

I remember someone from the XFS maintainers (Nathan?) saying they 
believe having solved all XFS stack issues.
If there are any XFS issues left, do you have a pointer to them?
