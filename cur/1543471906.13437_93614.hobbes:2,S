I don't think MOV sets any flags, but OR certainly does, as do all of
the arithmetic/logical instructions...

Not necessarily - it depends whether the program uses the flags just
after the instruction in question - but it would have to be taken into
account.

There IS a designated NOP instruction on the 80x86 family. However, as
with all processors I've come across, it's just an ordinary opcode
that happens to result in nothing being done.
From memory (and without references handy), here's the translation of
the official NOP opcode on various processors into English:
    6502	Jump to address in register PC.
    8080/Z80 	Move the contents of register DE into register DE.
    SC/MP	Wait for register PC to become non-zero.
In the case of the SC/MP processor, the "halt" instruction corresponds
to the instruction "Wait for register PC to become zero", and if they
happen to be stored in the highest location in the memory map, they
swap roles...
I could be wrong in each case, my memory isnae perfect, but the
decoding of the opcodes along those (very different) lines is real.
Best wishes from Riley.
