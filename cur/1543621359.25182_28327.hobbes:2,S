Sorry, it should read 2.4.17, not 2.4.17 :-(
Some of you asked for additional information, so here it is:
I don't remember which older kernels also produced this behaviour, but it
is very likely that 2.4.10 is one of them.
The machine is used as an internet server, running apache, zope, php,
postgresql, ftp-proxy and nfc-chat. It also runs a tivoli storage manager
client (dsmc) to take part in the university backup system, and has a
local X server and sshd for maintainance purpses. There are some other
standard daemons (ntp, cron etc.) running, but the machine does no routing
/ firewalling etc.
cpuinfo tells the following: (Yes, I know it is no good to run a server on
a Duron, but this decision was not mine.)

I also attached a .bzip2'ed variant of my 2.4.17 .config file.
[I'll be away 'till monday. I have access to the machine and my mail via
ISDN dialin over the weekend, but have to pay time-based.]
Thank you,
Markus Schaber
