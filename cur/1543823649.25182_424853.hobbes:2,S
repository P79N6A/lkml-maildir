What? Check out Xnest or Xephyr, they won't mess up anything :) Sure you
will note here that they require another X server running on, but my point
is that you SHOULD NOT confuse X in whole with an x _implementation_ like
Xorg of XFree86 and even the OS counts they runs on. Sure, you can write an
X server (or port/modify eg Xorg) which does not require root privs, and
others. So you don't want to create a new windowing system if the only
problem you have is about the implementation done by Xorg and/or Linux
kernel, etc etc ...
