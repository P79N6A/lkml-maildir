Hello again,
Jeff, did you found any informations about NForce4 SATA Controller?
I found a Product Brief/Specification and a Blockdiagramm.
Also found out that the CK804 supports TCQ/NCQ
-> snip
nForce4 Ultra and nForce4 SLi can support tagged command queuing and
native command queuing when used with SATA hard disks that support
these features

If NVidia followed the SATA-IO spec than should be possible to make them 
work with NCQ, or do I think wrong of that?
Or isn't it possible?
