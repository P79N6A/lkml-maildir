Actually, Linux-Mandrake 8.0 ships with Python 2.0, but your next

I didn't have trouble installing python 2.0 before LM 8.0 did that for me,
but I was probably just lucky.  I've seen some reports by other people who
did have difficulty upgrading python.  If the python installation difficulties
are a real obstacle, perhaps that is what needs to be fixed.
