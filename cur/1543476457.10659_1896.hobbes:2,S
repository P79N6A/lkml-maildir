Hi
I don't really know much about ISDN (except as a user), but have seen
some talk about it here recently.
I have just read (in Network News -- a paper publication) that Harmonix
has produced some ISDN cards that are 'Linux compliant'. They also
provide some sofware dev kits (didn't say if Open Source) and "has
adapted its config, monitoring and testing utilities to Linux".
For those that want info about this (UK) company phone: +44 1823 433711.
I have no connection with Harmonix: I just read the article.
