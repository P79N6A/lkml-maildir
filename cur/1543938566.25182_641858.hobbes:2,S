Ok. Great.

Should not have any adverse impact after the objects from the cpu queue 
have been consumed. If the cache_reaper tries to shift objects back 
from the per cpu queue into slabs then BUG_ONs may be triggered. Make sure 
you run the tests with full debugging please.

The dropping of GFP_THISNODE has the same effect as your patch. 
Objects from another node get into the per cpu queue. And on free we 
assume that per cpu queue objects are from the local node. If debug is on 
then we check that with BUG_ONs.
