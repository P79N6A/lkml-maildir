I thought for a round of testing it'd be worthwhile, particularly
testing randconfig.  The next version of percpu changes are coming
soon and I can remove them then.  Ideally, you are right, it'd
be nice to not have the percpu memory mapped for processors that are
not present.
One thing that comes into play is that (soon) the boot_pda will be
in the per_cpu area and it's maintained for all "possible" cpus as
it keeps track of some info on "off-lined" cpus.  What I was thinking
is that perhaps no memory is allocated (and mapped) until a cpu
becomes not only possible, but probable.  This means that until a
cpu is brought online, or discovered via ACPI, then there is no percpu
area and access to an invalid percpu area causes a kernel fault.
Thanks,
Mike
