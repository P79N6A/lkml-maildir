Sorry, I wasn't in too great of a mood.  Didn't mean to sound *that*
rough.  Anyways, I had just started using bitkeeper, and the change
didn't get committed properly, so it fell out of my bk tree when I made
the patch.  It had been tested mostly though.  I started using a much
more inclusive test .config though; and I'll have a working next
release.  Take a look at how well 2.5 currently compiles though =)
Fix is to remove the function __find_page_nolock from mm/filemap.c.
