Everyone can submit patches to the kernel tree. If your driver is open
source and you and your customers would benefit from having it just work
out of the box with distributions please consider submitting it. It also
helps maintainability because it becomes obvious when something will
break your driver and people can code accordingly (or submit fixes that
also fix up your driver code).
