We've hit this snag with a few architectures.  They're setting up
cpu_possible_map too late.  It's never been clearly defined.
sched_init() is called here:
asmlinkage void __init start_kernel(void)
{
	...
	printk(linux_banner);
	setup_arch(&command_line);
	setup_per_cpu_areas();
	smp_prepare_boot_cpu();
	sched_init();
Users of __GENERIC_PER_CPU definitely need cpu_possible_map to be initialised
by the time setup_per_cpu_areas() is called, so I think it makes sense to
say "thou shalt initialise cpu_possible_map in setup_arch()".
I guess Xen isn't doing that.  Can it be made to?
