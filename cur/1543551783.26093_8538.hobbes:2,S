Just that. It's an alternative implementation. It's a long story why
there's 2 drivers for the same device, and you can check the USB
archives to learn the whole story.
The short of it is that I didn't like the usb-uhci.c driver so I wrote a
different one. It looks like it was worth the effort since it works for
you whereas usb-uhci.c doesn't.
I'm sure the usb-uhci.c guys will be interested to follow up with you
about the problems you are seeing.
