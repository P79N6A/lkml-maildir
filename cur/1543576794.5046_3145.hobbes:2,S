No messages in syslog, but it died numerous times with "hdb
interrupt lost" and DRQ failed or something like that.  It seems
to work fine if I access any one drive, but if I copy from hdb ->
hdc the machine dies within seconds.
.config attached
I am thinking possible hardware failure, but I havent spent time
yet trying to narrow it down.
No special lilo options or any tweaking going on on this machine
other than hdparm..
