  Hummm.. why  not use  the more "obvious"  solution which is  using a
user-level thread  instead of  a kernel thread?   Then you  could make
whatever syscall  you want as  a process. Seems  cleaner to me,  and I
can't see any  obvious disadvantages (of course, I  don't know exactly
what you're trying to do over there). 
  You could  have the kernel spawn  a regular user  process to receive
system  calls   from  the  external  node  everytime   you  migrate  a
process. Or maybe even better,  one simple daemon which is responsible
for receiving syscalls for all external processes. 
  Or I'm way off park? 
  best regards!
