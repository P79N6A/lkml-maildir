The userland API _is_ stable; a stable intra-kernel API would *hinder* 
innovation ;-)

Generally, OS kernels have adopted and improved each others' ideas since the 
term was coined. Simply pulling out the Linux kernel and stating it has 
re-implemented more features than it innovated itself simply isn't fair. The 
same holds true for _any_ of the others!
BTW, PAM and NIS are userland. Certainly you don't want to compare even an 
average Linux distro with a plain solaris, AIX or *BSD* installation?
Also keep in mind that the Linux kernel is highly portable (handheld to 
mainframe), maybe only matched by NetBSD. This requires a major amount of 
maintenance care and some extra work for each new feature. And BSDs are not 
Unix, strictly speaking; Unix has "ripped off" BSD, as you would say.
You have simply fallen for some highly biased articles, if not propaganda.
