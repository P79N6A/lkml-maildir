overlapping is allowed. Does this board have onboard graphics ?
It looks like your top 8MB is shared video memory. (Ie, the graphics
chip doesn't have its own RAM). Usually theres things in the BIOS
to adjust the amount of RAM to allocate to the 'card' including
a disable option if you have a real card inserted instead.

Could be. If the answer to the above question is yes, then its normal.
What exactly are you finding slow ?
