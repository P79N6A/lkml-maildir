But what exactly those numbers mean?
A big number of reverts can mean that a developer usually submits unstable
stuff. But it can also mean that a developer cares so much about stability
that he'd rather revert, fix it and try to merge it in the next development
cycle. The "bad" maintainer that submits unstable stuff may try to fix
the reported bug instead of reverting it (but he won't fix the other 
undiscovered bugs that are still there because the code was not tested
well enought)
I don't think those numbers are very useful. Even the "number of bug reports
filed against the code of a given developer" is not considered meaningful as
measurement of good programming.
