I grant that in the updatedb case (or the backup case), the seeks are
going to suck and they're inherently on the same spindle as the user's
data, so there's no fixing it (short of a real "IO nice").
But in a related case, I have a background daemon that does a lot of IO
(mostly sequential, one page at a time read/modify/write of a multi-GB
file) to a filesystem on a separate spindle from my main filesystems.
I'd like to use a similar mechanism to say "don't let this program eat
my pagecache" that will let the daemon crunch away without severely
impacting my desktop work.
