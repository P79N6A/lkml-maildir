I wonder if it is a good idea to base mqueue limitation on the number of
message queues and not take into account how big they are.
64 message queues with 1 byte msgsize and 1 maxmsg is certainly quite
harmless and the system could have even more queues for such a user,
while 64 message queues with 16K msgsize (current default) and 40 maxmsg
(also default) eats ~ 40M of kernel memory.
