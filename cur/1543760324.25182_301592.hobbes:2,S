Hi Jean,
I'm sorry for a late reply, mail is (still) misbehaving. I hope this
arrives at all...

I'm pretty sure the patch is correct, I trust you a lot more on that than
myself (I still need to test it, though; but that's a detail). However,
this statement is not correct. I test this driver daily, I still own a
whole bunch of such cards. Even after hard reboots, they still just work.
Norm changes, input changes, everything works. I test (and use) all of
this. I would've noticed if it was really as broken as you're describing
above.
