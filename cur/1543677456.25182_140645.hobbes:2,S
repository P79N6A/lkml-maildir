Hi.
I've taken Linus out of the CC list as he'll not want to see this until
it's all sorted out...

I'm not sure whether your patch was for the 2.4 or 2.5 kernels. Linus has
just released the 2.5.71 kernel which I haven't yet downloaded, but when
UI have, I'll produce a patch for that as well. Enclosed is the relevant
patch against the 2.4.21 raw kernel tree with comments here:
 1. The asm-arm version of timex.h includes an arm-subarch header that
    is presumably supposed to define the relevant CLOCK_TICK_RATE for
    each sub-arch. However, some don't. I've included a catch-all in
    timex.h that defines CLOCK_TICK_RATE as being the standard value
    you've used if it isn't defined otherwise.
    Note that with the exception of the catch-all I've introduced, the
    various arm sub-arches all use values other than 1193182 here, so
    this architecture may need further work.
 2. The IA64 arch didn't define CLOCK_TICK_RATE at all, but then used the
    1193182 value as a magic value in several files. I've inserted that
    as the definition thereof in timex.h for that arch.
 3. The PARISC version of timex.h didn't define CLOCK_TICK_RATE at all.
    Other than the magic values in several generic files, it apparently
    didn't use it either. I've defined it with the 1193182 value here.
This patch defines CLOCK_TICK_RATE for all architectures as far as I can
tell, so the result should compile fine across them all. I can only test
it for the ix86 arch though as that's all I have.
 > Anyone disagrees with changing all the instances of 1193180/1193182 to

Other than the ARM architecture, that appears to be the value used for
all of the currently supported architectures in the 2.4 kernel series...
Best wishes from Riley.
