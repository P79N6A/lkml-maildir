Ingo,
you are the man!
My 1 GHz Athlon II, 640 MB, is up and running with 2.4.17-O(1)-H6.
Writing this under KDE-2.2.2 (KMail) during
time nice +19 make -j40 modules
Max load was: 41,97
Great!
dbench 32 during artsd (noatun, KDE-2.2.2) playing Ogg-Vorbis
"show" hiccup when
artsd (two sub processes) are in
wait_on_p
rt_sigsus
and/or
dbench procs are in
get_reque
wait_on_b
do_journ (ReiserFS?)
Even when I renice both artsd procs I get hiccup.
  PID USER     PRI  NI PAGEIN  SIZE  RSS SHARE WCHAN     STAT %CPU %MEM

But when I put the Ogg-Vorbis file into /dev/shm I get _NO_ hiccup anymore!!!
So it is only disk IO limited with your O(1)-H6.
Wow, that is fantastic!!!
Never had that before.
Writing during both...;-)
Redid it without renice (-19):
some very few short hiccup.
