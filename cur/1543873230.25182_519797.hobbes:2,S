Exactly. Statistically, first touch will work OK. It may mean some
reclaim inefficiencies in corner cases, but things will tend to
even out.

But a lot of that is happening anyway for other reasons (eg. memory
plug/unplug). And I don't consider node/zone setup to be part of the
"core VM" as such... it is _good_ if we can move extra work into setup
rather than have it in the mm.
That said, I don't think this patch is terribly intrusive either.

I don't know that it would be particularly harder than any other
first-touch scheme. If one container ends up being charged with too
much pagecache, eventually they'll reclaim a bit of it and the pages
will get charged to more frequent users.

But this patch gives the groundwork to handle 1-4, and it is in a small
chunk, and one would be able to apply different limits to different types
of pages with it. Just using rmap to handle 1 does not really seem like a
viable alternative because it fundamentally isn't going to handle 2 or 4.
I'm not saying that you couldn't _later_ add something that uses rmap or
our current RSS accounting to tweak container-RSS semantics. But isn't it
sensible to lay the groundwork first? Get a clear path to something that
is good (not perfect), but *works*?
