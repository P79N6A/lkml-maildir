Please use Enhanced speedstep config option as well under Ppower
Management->cpufreq (with ACPI option under it enabled too). That will
configure speedstep-centrino driver, which should work here.
Speedstep-centrino driver is a better option than acpi-cpufreq, as it
will do much faster P-state transition.
Thanks,
Venki
