If ac97_chip=1 and ac97 doesn't exists - driver will refuse to load.
If ac97_chip=2 and ac97 doesn't exists - driver should ignore ac97
But I don't know if this is correct (I am not author of patch and I not tested it).
if message is printed then there is
goto no_ac97; /* FIXME: get rid of ugly gotos.. */
this will skip ac97 mixer creation (if ac97 is not there this will fail and driver refuses to load)
But I don't know if snd_ac97_bus will fail if there is no ac97 codec (I think - not, and this is not correct), then test should be done on snd_ac97_mixer and not on snd_ac97_bus creation.
