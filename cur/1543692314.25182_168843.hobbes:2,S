This release broke ALSA for me. OSS emulation continued to work for 
xmms, but not for wine. The via_82xx driver told me to try 
dxs_support=1, so I did and it works again.
This is an ALC650-based:
00:11.5 Multimedia audio controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. 
VT8233/A/8235 AC97 Audio Controller (rev 50)
(I'm sorry if this is a second post to LKML - mailer problems)
