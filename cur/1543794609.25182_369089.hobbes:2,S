Demonstrate it if you can.
The fact is that the closest thing to a demonstration that we have,
demonstrated the opposite of what you claim, so you'll have an hard
time to convince me about your point given you've no way to demonstrate
it.
I can guarantee that my machine is safe by running top, the only thing
that escapes the easy "top" check is CPUShare and I want to fix it,
since I can.
