I disagree.  This is the wrong goal to be aiming for.
A temporary directory for deleted files can, and should be,
implemented in userspace.
What is much more interesting is the possibility of what I described
earlier in the thread as a virtual WORM device, and what Andreas
said could be done with LVM already using filesystem snapshots -
I.E. the ability to mount the filesystem as it was at any date and
time in the past.
However, as far as I can see, LVM snapshots are a manual process - the
user has to expressly create a snapshot when they want it.
What I was thinking of was a virtual device that allocated a new
sector whenever an old one was overwritten - kind of like a journaled
filesystem, but without the filesystem, (I.E. just the journal) :-).
John.
