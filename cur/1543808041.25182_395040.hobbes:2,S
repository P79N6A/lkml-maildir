why do we want to use clone()? Just because of its name and flags?
I think it is really strange to fork() to create network context. What 
has process creation has to do with it?
After all these clone()'s are called, some management actions from host 
system are still required, to add these IPs/routings/etc.
So? Why mess it up? Why not create a separate clean interface for 
container management?
