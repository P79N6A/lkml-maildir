Wouldn't it be better if the initial thread _became_ the manager thread,
and a new thread was implicitly created as a duplicate of what it was
doing?
Sure, it would need some fiddling (e.g., the `old' thread, which now
becomes the manager, will be the one to get a new stack; the old stack is
moved to the `new' initial thread).  But it would simplify the rest, no?

Hmm...  Not a nice problem...

This will probably solve this part of the problem beautifully.
I remember someone (David Wragg <dpw@doc.ic.ac.uk>) once mentioned another
new flag idea: a CLONE_SIBLING flag, which will mean that if the new
thread does a clone() the new thread will get the same ppid of the parent.
This (together with the redefinition of the manager thread, above) will
mean that all of the threads report directly to the manager, and any
thread may create another thread _without_ communicating to the manager
(it just creates a new sibling).

Ehh...  What about just doing something similar to the daemon start-up
code--- a la if (clone(...)) exit(0); ??  (Of course, while taking care to
cheat well enough that the thread won't notice it's actually a new kernel
task...)

This is a bit of a problem: currently core dumps are for tasks, not
`processes' (which are actually a userspace abstraction, which in the
LinuxThreads case is implemented as multiple tasks).  We first need some
way of telling the kernel that a complete set of tasks is to be terminated
now, and all need to dump core to just one coredump file... :-*
(It's probably also related to solving the problem of `how to make a
debugger attach to a running multithreaded program...)
