When I get a chance I will try pre7 because it is the only pre version I
haven't tried.. I suspect the alpha changes in pre8 is what is killing
me but I don't have a way to prove it yet. Anything post pre6 (and I'm guessing
pre7) will not boot up all the way... it will stop at various points
depending on what pre version I use.
Has anyone ran a post-pre6 kernel on a DEC Multia successfully?
I know it might not be much of a showstopper but it is for me. :)
I'll dig around tonite if time permits.
