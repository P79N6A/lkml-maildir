the dmesg output looks better, but it still doesn't work:
<--  snip  -->
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture Driver Version 0.9.4 (Mon Jun 09 12:01:18 2003 UTC).
request_module: failed /sbin/modprobe -- snd-card-0. error = -16specify port
pnp: the driver 'ad1816a' has been registered
pnp: match found with the PnP device '01:01.00' and the driver 'ad1816a'
pnp: match found with the PnP device '01:01.01' and the driver 'ad1816a'
pnp: Device 01:01.00 activated.
pnp: Device 01:01.01 activated.
ALSA device list:
  No soundcards found.
<--  snip  -->
This problem is hopefully not unresolvable, the card works fine 
with ISAPNP with both kernel 2.4 and kernel 2.5 <= 2.5.72 .
