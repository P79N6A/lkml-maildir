Perhaps is just synchronization of caches. 
say you want to sum all the elements of a vector in parallele split in
two pieces:
int total=0;
thread 1:
	for fist half
		total += v[i]
thread 2:
	for second half
		total += v[i]
and you tought: 'well, I need a mutex for access to total. that will slow
down things, lets use separate counters':
int bigtotal;
int total[2];
thread 1:
	for fist half
		total[0] += v[i]
thread 2:
	for second half
		total[1] += v[i]
bigtotal = total[0]+total[1]
The problem ? total[0] and total[1] are nearby one of each other. So in
the same cache line. So on every write to total[?], even if they are
independent, system has to synchrnize caches.
Big iron (SGI, Sparc), has special hardware, but cheap PC mobos...
