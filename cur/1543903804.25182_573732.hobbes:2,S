Just because something is dual core - doesn't mean it is capable of true SMP.
The 2 blackfin cores on the BF561 have their own L1 cache, but the caches are 
not coherent to the internal L2 (which is not cache, but just memory), or 
external L3.
This precludes SMP where common memory must be addressed by both cores.
