Hello,
 I am one of mandrake linux volunteer experts,and i have recently purchase 
one of the ecs K7S5A boards and though i did experience minor problems with 
the board during the install.I got mandrake to install and run 
flawlessly.Includeing the onboard sis7012 sound card and i am useing the 
intel_810 kernel driver for the sound card which works great.I learned alot 
of things very quickly about this board and if you would like some info on 
how I am useing this board here is my hardware profile on it.
1-atlon 1.2 gihz
2-onboard sis900 lan card
3-sis 7012 onboard sound card
4-realtek 8139 lancard
5-nvidia riva tnt2 agp video
6-zoom externel zoom link 56k modem

this machine has been up non stop for months now without problems and I am 
running a slightly modified kernel distributed by mandrake
2.4.17-22mdk
and it is installed on system running mandrake 8.1
i learned a whole lot about this board and what to disable in the factory 
bios to get it to install correctly
if you would like info let me know
