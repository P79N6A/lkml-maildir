Subject: trying to free free IRQ in 2.3.14

What is the current status of chasing down whatever causes the above
messages?  After compiling 2.3.14 (the first post-2.3.9 dev kernel I was
able to wrestle into compiling) and booting the above kernel I started
getting those messages.  The odd thing is, every time I rebooted that
kernel, something different happened.  The first time I got a free free
message for IRQ11 (IRQ11 is shared by my two ethernet cards) and dhcp
refused to work.  The second time I got a message referring to IRQ4 and
IRQ12 (PS/2 mouse).  The third time, the code tried probing for hdm
(what?).  I don't mind trying to debug something, but the changing
messages are confusing.
I could submit a full bug-report if someone might find it helpful.
