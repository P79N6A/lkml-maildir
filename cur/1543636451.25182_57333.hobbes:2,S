Right, but this would have to be taken up with Tivoli "do snapshot as
dsmc starts, backup from snapshot and discard snapshot on exit"

In that case, when you are restoring from backups, you can also
regenerate index files (at least with tradspool, I never looked at the
"News in Dosen" aggregated spools like CNFS or whatever). It's really
hard if you have .dir/.pag style dbm data bases that don't mirror some
other single-file format.
