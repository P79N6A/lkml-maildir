Subject: Kernel Panic on 2.6.0-test5 with XFS filesystem

Upon an upgrade from the 2.4.22-AC4 series kernel to the 2.6.0-test5 kernel, a
serious problem was encountered. A kernel panic occured, stating that the XFS
magic number on the root partition was bad. However, 2.4.22-AC4 gave no errors
and loaded fine.
A bug was filed with Gentoo Linux, detailing this issue. The X86-Kernel team
suggested that I follow up with LKML.

 is a bug report filed against
SGI's XFS team.
This problem was encountered on:
2.4.20 kernels Con Kolivas built
2.6.0-test5 kernel
Gentoo's 2.4.20-gaming-r5 kernel
This problem was NOT encountered on:
2.4.22-ac4 kernel
Any followup would be nice :) I have CC'ed the SGI XFS team and Con Kolivas.
***Please CC me on any followup reports. I am not suscribed.***
My sincerest apologies if this is a duplicate report. I STFW many times, but saw
nothing similar.
