Many of these problems have been solved before.  See for instance Zap
and ckpt (www.cs.wisc.edu/~zandy/ckpt), and more examples at
http://www.checkpointing.org/
Certainly there are pieces of state which are harder to correclty
restore than others, but even network connections have been shown to be
migrateable (see zap, and tpccp for cryopid).  In fact IIUC one of the
hardest things to deal with are ttys.

Yup, sysv shmem has been handled before...  And yes, there are plenty
more :)  /proc files, device files, pipes...

This has been demonstrated to be not true.  Again, see ckpt for a simple
example.
Oh, right, well willingness to run inside of a container *is* something we
would require :)  Not needed for checkpointing a single process,
however - see ckpt.

It shouldn't.  This was a request for comment, not for inclusion :)  As
you say there are lots of pieces to put together, and we simply decided
to start with trying to solve this one.
In fact what I sent out doesn't even do the stuff we've been talking
about lately - that will come later this week.  This patchset merely lays
the groundwork for that.
