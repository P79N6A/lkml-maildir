please fix the coding style in lib/statistic.c. It's full of:
{
        unsigned long long i;
        if (value <= stat->u.histogram.range_min)
                return 0;
put a newline after variable sections.
and:
        on_each_cpu(_statistic_barrier, NULL, 0, 1);
        return 0;
preferably use a newline before 'return' statements as well. (this is 
not always necessary, but in the above case it looks better)
