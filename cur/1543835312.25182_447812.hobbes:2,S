It's fairly new (Solaris 10 only), so nobody knows about it, and
(anecdotally) it's full of bugs. The interface looks nice on paper,
though.
It's documented at
http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/816-5168/6mbb3hrir?a=view
but docs.sun.com has gone to hell lately, so you might have trouble
accessing it.
http://partneradvantage.sun.com/protected/solaris10/adoptionkit/tech/man/port_create.txt
seems to work right now, but it doesn't have nice hyperlinks to the
related pages.
