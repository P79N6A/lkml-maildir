It wasn't abolished, there was a showstopper problem discovered before 
the ink was dry on the original announcment of 2.6.8.  Thats (the .1) 
the fixed release.
Stuff happens.  To me, thats a very minor concern.  My 11 year old 
Shelty friend and pet took sick and died a horrible death all in 
about 4 hours today while we were unable to locate a vet who was 
available on a Saturday.  So an instant fix .1 release is very minor 
to me.
