Guys,
I was using DDD - just started it up and started debugging when it locked
up the kernel really solidly, I *mean* SOLID, such that I couldn't use the
SAK, had to reset the machine. I wasn't even root! 
I found this item in the logs:
Jan 24 19:33:34 tahallah kernel: Bad pmd in pte_alloc: 000001e3 
What does that mean? I'm assuming this caused my machine to lock up.
See signature below for system details. 
Cheers,
Alex
