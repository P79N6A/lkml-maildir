Probably. I'll give it a try.
I have to find a way to unlock the flash at some point, though. Is it
okay if I add code to physmap to iterate over the partitions and unlock
the writable ones if info->mtd->unlock is non-null? Or is there a
better way to do it?
Andrew, please don't merge any of the patches in this series. I just
noticed that the SMC patch should be cleaned up a bit, so I'm
probably going to rework all the patches.
(btw, I got an "awaiting moderator approval" message from the linux-mtd
mailer because "Message has a suspicious header". Can someone tell me
more about this so I can fix my mailer?)
Thanks,
Haavard
