Soft modems may work pretty well in userspace - slmodem is example.
Real-time requirement for V.34 is 40ms response time and only once during
the session when echo canceller parameters are negotiatiated (so you may
decrease "buffer size" before and increase after - there are enouph
silence places for such manipulations). Fax itself does not require any
"realtime" AFAIK, other place is almost unused today V.32 - 26ms, also
for echo canceller setup.

Sasha.
