Sure. subtree checking will break renames if you rename from one
directory to another. This is not a new 2.6 feature. It occurs on 2.4
servers too...
It is because a server with subtree checking enabled will encode the
parent directory inside the filehandle. When you rename so that the
parent directory changes, the old filehandle becomes stale.
