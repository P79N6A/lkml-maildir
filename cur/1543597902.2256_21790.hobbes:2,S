Hello,
This is probably a kernel newbie question so my apologies in advance.
I have a design/implementation question.
global_irq_count is defined as atomic_t whereas globall_irq_lock is
defined as unsigned volatiile int.
Is this by design? or by chance?
Why would you be concerned about reading global_irq_count atomically and
not global_irq_count as it is done is several
functions in linux/arch/i386/irq.c in kernel 2.2.18.
If it is by design, what am I missing.
Please cc me on your respone as I am not on the list.
Take care!
