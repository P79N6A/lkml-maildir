Subject: [PATCH] fix /proc printing of TASK_DEAD state
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I just stumbled across this patch that's been sitting in my tree for ages.
I thought I'd sent this in before.  It's a trivial fix for the printing of
task state in /proc and sysrq dumps and such, so that TASK_DEAD shows up
correctly.  This state is pretty much only ever there to be seen when there
are exit/reaping bugs, but it's not like that hasn't come up.
Thanks,
Roland
