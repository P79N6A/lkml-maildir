I'm running on *-rc4 at the moment, so thanks very much for the patch.
I think there were ~3 of my modules producing similar output, but after 
I followed someone's advice about enabling most of the CONFIG_DEBUG_* 
switches, I experienced quite a bit more trouble getting anything to log 
(or do anything but freeze). Now, all the modules are loading fine.
If I get time I'll probably be asking which of the 9 or 10 CONFIG_DEB* 
switches are compatible with one another, but actually it may have just 
been the same bug that would hang me up when they were on. I'll test 
with the full CONFIG_DEBUG .config later on.
Appreciate it,
Mick
