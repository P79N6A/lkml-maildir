Nothing in the Debian policy says that packages mustn't use bash in
scripts (see section 11.4. of the Debian policy [1]) and since bash is an
essential package in Debian it's garuanteed to be available on every
Debian installation.
It isn't allowed to use bash in a script that calls
  #!/bin/sh
but if a script uses
  #!/bin/bash
instead it can use all of bash's features.
