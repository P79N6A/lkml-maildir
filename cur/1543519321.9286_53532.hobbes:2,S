Yes, possible.

A way how to verify the table completely would be to attach a mouse
to the keyboard port, set in it echo mode (send 0xee), then send bytes,
and see what comes, the mouse echoes back everything except 0xec - 
echo cancel.
I think you'll find different results for different i8042's with this,
and that's one of the reasons I speak about the warped glass ...
Because then you have to care not only about keyboard quirks, but also
about i8042's quirks, and the result if you combine them ...

It's a 1-1 correspondence for keys that generate scancodes < 127 in
Set2. However, this isn't the case for all keyboards - for example
the Focus9k and quite a bunch of other keyboards generate scancodes
> 128, and although the table isn't a problem, because it doesn't
change most of the keys above 127, adding the eighth bit for release
IS a problem - you get the same byte for both a press and a release
of a key, and although this can be worked around it's far from nice.
Because all keyboards use Set2 by default, all of them will also work
with the i8042 translation switched off - they don't know about it.
About whether all i8042's support switching the translation off -
I can't say for sure, but neither I nor anyone else was able to find
one that wouldn't be able to do that.
USB keyboards don't emulate the XT nonsense at all. It's the computers
BIOS that emulates this in software when you have an USB keyboard
attached, and does that through the SMM mode. And yes, it emulates
XT (translated set2) only. However that isn't a problem, since we
already have a native USB keyboard driver in the kernel, and the USB
controller XT keyboard emulation support is switched off immediately
upon loading the USB controller driver.

For some reason, most of the AT keyboards I have here generate 0x83 for
F7. Don't know why - the documented value is 0x02. But it's translated
correctly by the i8042.

Oops? They are not. Only one keyboard (the BTC one) has problems with
this, all others I have work fine.

Well, it would make things easier, the only problem is that the USB
HUT (Hid Usages Table) doesn't cover all the keys axisting on many
keyboards. We'd have to extend it to be useful ...
