It has some work to do - the amount in question depends upon the file
system and device drivers in use. For very high throughput read up on
the O_DIRECT feature.

I doubt an ICH6 has the total memory bandwidth to achieve that to be
honest, but with PCI-E maybe you can.

You don't give anything like enough information to even guess this. What
controller, what disks, what driver, what kernel version ?

For vendor kernels, especially older ones it is probably best to ask the
vendor first.
