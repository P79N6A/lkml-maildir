OK, hold it right there...
So, IIRC the problem was that you were seeing abominable retrans rates
on UDP and TCP, and you are using a 100Mbit hub rather than a switch?
What does the collision LED look like, when you see these performance
problems?
Also, does that hub support NICs that do autonegotiation? (I'll bet the
answer is "no").
Cheers,
