This has nothing to do with only having 1GB of kernel address 
space and not enough virtual space to load a large swath of drivers
or support modules loading reentrantly.  It's a little difficult to quantify
 how much kernel address space will be needed when you don't
know if a full configuration will fit into it.  The fact people use this 
patch at all is **EVIDENCE THAT THERE ALREADY IS A PROBLEM**
with limiting kernel address space to 1GB.  And who the hell cares about 
a mouldy, antiquated ABI spec modeled after 1970 Unix technology anyway?  It 
should be another option for executable formats.   All this ABI compatibility huey 
is some Intel/SCO pipe dream for supporting applications across multiple Unix 
platforms anyway.  If it doesn't run on Linux, who the hell cares?
