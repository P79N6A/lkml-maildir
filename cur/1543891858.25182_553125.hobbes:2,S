Hi,
The first of the following two patches introduces hibernation and suspend
notifiers that can be used by subsystems to perform tasks related to suspend
and/or hibernation that cannot be done from device drivers' .suspend() and
.resume() callbacks.
The second one uses the notifiers to disable the user mode helper functionality
before a hibernation/suspend.
Greetings,
Rafael
