On the other hand a bug in my favourite cd burner application could
give away SYS_CAP_RAWIO instead, and I think that is even worse.
Besides, checking SYS_CAP_RAWIO at open time is the way /dev/mem
works.  OTOH applications don't normally hand over /dev/mem to other
applications I suppose.  
I'm just tossing ideas around, please ignore me if they are stuipd :-)
