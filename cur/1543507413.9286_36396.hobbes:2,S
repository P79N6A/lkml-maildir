This is not possible. The Linux SCSI drivers that I know don't allcoate an
entry in the list of SCSI devices, not in /proc/scsi/scsi, nor in /dev/sg?.
But what do you want to achieve by sending SCSI commands via sg to the
adapter? 
The adapters don't support target mode by the way, so you can't communicate
between two SCSI adapters. I believe, Marc SCHAEFER is working on it.

Normally, you don't want to tal to the adpater, but to devices attached to it.
This is just handled the normal way: Use one of the high level interfaces,
Linux provides: sd, sr, st, sg.
If you want to change SCSI adapter configuration, some adapters provide
kernel/module parameters. Some are even configurable dynamically via the
/proc interface.

Hope this helps.
