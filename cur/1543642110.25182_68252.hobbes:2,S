Well, in the linuxppc_2_4_devel tree
(
http://penguinppc.org/dev/kernel.shtml
), it's possible to change all of
these parameters for custom applications, like what you describe later.
One important thing to keep in mind, is that MAX_LOW_MEM cannot be
bigger than 0xF00000000 - KERNELBASE (which by default is 0xC0000000) or
bad things can happen.  And if you modify KERNELBASE, there's other
things you need to be aware of, so if you're going to do this, please
look at the linuxppc_2_4_devel tree (or in 2.5) to see all of the
interdependancies.
