Hello ML,
I have one broken harddisk, but most of the sectors are still ok.
Whenn I try to dump the data via dd_rescue and it comes to faulty
bytes/bits/whatever the kernel takes a lot of time (retries, timeout?)
till it recognizes that it's broken. (The usual error in kernel log...).
Is there a possibilty to speed this up? Maybe there is a kernel patch or
I can access this device in a different way?
TIA
