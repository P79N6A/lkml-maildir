Here's what I don't understand: according to PCI rules, pci config read
can bypass pci config write (both are non-posted).
So why does doing it help flush the writes as the comment claims?
Isn't this more the case of
/* pci_config_write seems to complete asynchronously on Altix systems.
 * This is probably broken but its not clear what's the best
 * thing to do is - for now, do pci_read_config_dword which seems to flush
 * everything out. */
