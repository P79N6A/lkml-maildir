Cool. :)

But wait, there's more! :)  Specfically, four or five new items at the end of 
the list, a bit more research on the unresolved stuff, and one dropped item 
(zoom support) which Alan said was just a driver forward-port from 2.4 rather 
than a significant new feature.
I'll post the updated one in a minute or two...

I'm waiting to hear about that myself...

Initramfs somebody has to ask Al Viro about, but at this point, the user space 
stuff (including H. Peter Anvin's klib) to make initramfs useful isn't ready 
enough for it to be useful, so I'm guessing it's next unstable series.
The main benefit from initramfs is the ability to rip stuff out of the kernel 
and put it in userspace early.  There's not likely to be much ripping out 
done after the feature freeze, so even if the infrastructure went in at this 
point...
