Subject: [patch 0/5] autoparam v0.2: generating parameter descriptions on compile
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi!
The purpose of autoparam is to generate boot parameter descriptions
from sources. It does that by creating a new section called
__param_strings. (The interesting bits here are from Magnus Damm.)
It fills a gap about undocumented boot options from modules.
It consists of 5 patches:
autoparam_1-includes
  Descriptions get saved in __param_strings. Also added a new
  __setup_desc().
autoparam_2-makefile
  On every vmlinux change .kernel-parameters.o gets regenerated, and
  __param_strings removed from vmlinux. (It's still bigger than
  non-patched vmlinux, but all sections are of same length, alignment
  issues?)
  Also, a new target "make kernelparams" which generates
  Documentation/kernel-parameters-gen.txt. It should probably not be
  in $(srctree) though.
  There should be some more work done here, but I'm out of ideas ATM.
autoparam_3-extract_script
  Simple perl script to extract descriptions.
autoparam_4-af_unix_workaround
autoparam_5-ide_workaround
  Workarounds needed.
Comments, improvements?
