That alone doesn't help. You would also have to disable at least bh
while windows functions are being executed, otherwise the scheduler
may crash when trying to switch to some other task. Even worse with 4K
stacks: take a look at how do_IRQ works, the common interrupt entry
point. It calls current_thread_info, thus expects to preempt normal
kernel stacks. So, should we execute Windows driver code with IRQs
off? I don't think so.

Too simple approach. You cannot deny that two or more functions of
ndiswrapper or the windows driver are being executed concurrently.

Ndiswrapper is already slower than native drivers are, also due to
horribly implemented Windows drivers btw (the ndis model itself isn't
that bad, though).
After all the issues coming up, I'm even more convinced that any
effort on stack switching is better spent on moving ndiswrapper to
userspace - also expensive but safer in many ways.
