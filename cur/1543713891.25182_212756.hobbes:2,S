Hi!
As said in the subject, my laptop hangs when I plug in the power cable or pull 
it out. The machine just hangs without any kernel panic or something. I get 
no entries in /var/log/messages and also no output on the console kernel log 
(F12). It seems that the kernel gets into an infinite loop, because the cpu 
fan starts to spin at its highest rate. Also SysRq-B doesn`t work, so I have 
to switch off my laptop to restart it.
I did not have this problem with any 2.4.x kernel.
What can I try to fix this problem?
cu,
  Emmy
