Subject: [PATCH] V-6.0 ZAPHOD Single Priority Array O(1) CPU Scheduler
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/10/20/4

Version 6.0 of the ZAPHOD single priority array scheduler patches for 
the 2.6.9 kernel are now available for download and evaluation from:
<
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/cpuse/patch-2.6.9-spa_zaphod_FULL-v6.0?download>
Notes on ZAPHOD's features are available at:
<
https://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?group_id=112404&release_id=273135>
This is the first stage of a code reorganization that moves as much new 
code as possible out of sched.c into separate source files in order to 
make it easier to implement alternative (to ZAPHOD) single priority 
array (SPA) schedulers on top of the SPA base.  As a consequence, the 
other SPA schedulers (e.g. HYDRA) are not yet available for 2.6.9 and 
will probably not be available for several days.
