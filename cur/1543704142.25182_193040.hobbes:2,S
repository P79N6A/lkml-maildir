Yeah, but actually, I'm pretty desperate :)

That last bit I know. And with agpgart and nvidia-agp loaded, it's
actually using AGP... but the screen is a real mess.

And you can not by chance point me to some locations where I can figure
out myself, so that I could try to patch the opensource portion myself?
It really looks like all relevant code would be in the opensource
portion.
Judging from my point of view I think it must have something to do with
different memory mapping or the like, as it looks like my X server
(independent mode, so I should actually have two framebuffers) is
writing into the same (physical?) memory area for both screens.
Just give me some hints where I should start browsing the code, I can
figure out thinks myself then. Pretty, pretty please :-)

Julien
