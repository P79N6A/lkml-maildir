Paul, it took me a bit to figure this out too, but Corey uses the TLA
"SMI" to mean "Systems Management Interface", not "Systems Management
Interrupt".   From Documentation/IPMI.txt:
ipmi_msghandler - This is the central piece of software for the IPMI
system.  It handles all messages, message timing, and responses.  The
IPMI users tie into this, and the IPMI physical interfaces (called
System Management Interfaces, or SMIs) also tie in here.
There are at least 4 basic types of physical hardware interfaces (BT,
SMIC, KCS, and I2C), which may (or more often, may not) have their own
hardware interrupt lines, but these are normal interrupts, not
CPU-magic "systems management interrupts".  So I think this isn't a
problem.
Thanks,
Matt
