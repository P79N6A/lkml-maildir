yes, considering you load a mapping for every 2MB data block, then it
should close to dm-linear for sequential read.

ic. sounds reasonable.

this is like the prefetch of mapping information.

right. and i think this might be COW formats unrelated. this solely
depends on the mapping logic at user space to do intentional allocation,
tracing, and cleaning.

project name is stgt, you can find it at berlios.de, which is down right
now. :P
