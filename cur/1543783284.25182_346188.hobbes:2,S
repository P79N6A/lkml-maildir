I haven't been following linux kernel development for a while, so I'm not
sure what the status is.  I noticed that there is now crypto support in the
kernel, including e.g. AES.  I would like to use hardware acceleration
where available, e.g., VIA EPIA.  Does the current kernel crypto support
include hardware acceleration, or is there any projects working on this?
