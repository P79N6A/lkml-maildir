Thank you for the applaude.  Actually, it was my very first result of
Linux kernel hack...

Oops!  I didn't aware of that.  The reason I changed ext2_match() was
for my news server, where almost all files have same leading characters,
as:
    news:~/spool/articles/control/cancel$ ls -1 | tail -10
    32942461
    32942462
    32942463
    32942464
    32942465
    32942466
    32942467
    32942468
    32942469
    32942470
Therefore, for news servers, checking the last character first should
be a great win.  Anyway, please correct my error and clean up my patch
as well.

I will certainly appreciate a lot if you do that.  Your caching should
be more effective for the general puropse users.
