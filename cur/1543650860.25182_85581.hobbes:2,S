You are confusing review with perspective.  I've read 
http://lkcd.sourceforge.net/download/latest/
 before, and just checked it 
again tonight before posting.
My view is:  LKCD becomes useful to merge when the average user can do 
"safe" disk dumps.  netdumps are better for corporate customers, but for 
average users, disk dumps are _the_ method which is easiest, most 
accessible, and thus most helpful to kernel hackers debugging their 
problems.  LKCD has a dump block dev driver, but it's not even close to 
being low-level enough to be "safe".
Re-read my other post(s) -- I have said repeatedly that LKCD's 
infrastructure is decent.  But it's completely pointless to merge a 
decent infrastructure unless the users are up to snuff.  It's much 
smarter to keep the infrastructure out of the kernel until the low-level 
dump drivers are hammered out and stable, because that gives you more 
freedom to change the API.

I have.  Nothing has changed.  Stable, polling, low-level disk dumps are 
not in the LKCD patches.
IMO, net dump is what corporate customers and network admins want.  And 
overall, net dumps are probably easier and much safer than disk dumps, 
from an implementor's perspective.  However, disk dumps are what the 
average kernel hacker will find most useful, because it is the easiest 
for end users, and thus will generate a higher number of quality bug 
reports.
