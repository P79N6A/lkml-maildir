The logic in the patch is to enable large requests _if_ the drive can do
48-bit lba. However, we will only use 48-bit lba commands if the request
is either beyond 2^28 sectors _or_ bigger than 256 sectors since neither
of these can be addressed with 28-bit lba.
See rq_lba48 in the patch, it explains it.
