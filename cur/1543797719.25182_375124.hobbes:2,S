Tony,
The approach just fixes compiler scheduling barrier problem of cpu_relax, and there is no hint@pause inside the loop.
Today I tried the latest icc, 9.0.027. It provides __hint, a new intrinsic, to support hint@pause. __hint also has the meaning of compiler scheduling barrier. So the best solution is to use __hint(0). The disassembled result showed the new intrinsic did work.
