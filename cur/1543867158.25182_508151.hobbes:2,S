So, my AMD Athlon XP2400+ with pata_pdc2027x, pata_sil680 and pata_via
survived four days of bonnie++, emerge -e world, dd if=//dev/random
of=/tmp/whatever, and most of all, four days of me :)
SO I guess it's safe to assume I didn't find any weird things by using
2.6.20 and the new libata drivers.
Now, since functionality by design is boring and my employer doesn't
torture me enough,, I' pulled the libsata-dev git and linux-2.6 git
and will see how that goes.
Tests on my Siemens laptop are still in progress, since i have to
reboot to windows every day (cooperate rules at work, network
authentication, yadayada).
I didnt have time yet to install Linux on my HP Pavilion dv8373 and on
my Dual P2 400Mhz with Intel 440BX motherboard, but I hope to do this
soon.
Have a joyfull day and i hope you have better weather than we have
here in Amsterdam.
