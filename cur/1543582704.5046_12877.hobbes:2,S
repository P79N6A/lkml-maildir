Actually, I've also started receiving complaints that the
system keeps processes in memory too much and evicts the
cache from memory too soon...
It all depends on what kind of workload you are using.
In the current 2.4 VM, I have not found a way to make this
balancing do the right thing automatically. If anybody has
an idea (or a patch) to make this thing work, let me know.

Rik
