Yeah, I was thinking about this overnight too. It should be doable. In
addition to what we already do, I think you'd want:
- to copy the assembly to do the copying to a safe page;
- to put the location of the cpu state that was saved in the image
header so that it can be used after the data is copied back;
- to copy the nosave data to a 'safe' page.
What else?
