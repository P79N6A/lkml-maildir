The 2 byte overhead of SLOB becomes a liability when it comes to correctly 
aligning power of two sized object. SLOB has to add two bytes and then 
align the combined object (argh!). SLUB can align these without a 2 byte 
overhead. In some configurations this results in SLUB using even less 
memory than SLOB. See f.e. Pekka's test at 
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=118405559214029&w=2

The advantage of SLOB is to be able to put objects of multiple sizes into 
the same slab page. That advantage goes away once we have more than a few 
objects per slab because SLUB can store object in a denser way than SLOB.

Well if you just have a few dentries then they are likely all pinned. A 
large number of dentries will typically result in reclaimable slabs.
The slab defrag patchset not only deals with the dcache issue but provides 
similar solutions for inode and buffer_heads. Support for other slabs that
defragment can be added by providing two hooks per slab.

Both SLOB and SLAB suffer from the single lock problem. SLOB does it for 
every item allocated. SLAB does it for every nth item allocated. Given 
a fast allocation from multiple processors both will generate a bouncing 
cacheline. SLUB can take pages from the page allocator pools and allocate 
all objects from it without taking a lock.

I still have trouble to see that SLOB still has much to offer. An embedded 
allocator that in many cases has more allocation overhead than the default 
one? Ok you still have advantages if allocations are rounded up to the 
next power of two for a kmalloc and because of the combining of different 
types of allocations in a single slab if there are an overall small number 
of allocations. If one would create a custom slab for the worst problems 
there then this may also go away.
