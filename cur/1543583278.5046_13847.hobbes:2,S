Yes, but do we want to spread the IrDA code around? The same argument
applies to IrDA device drivers!?

Sorry, some of the dongles don't follow the spec fully, as you can see from
our table. Actually none of them follow the spec, since they are all based
on the same chip which was made before the spec was finished. But there 
should be a new dongle out now which do follow the spec (but we haven't 
got hold of it yet)
