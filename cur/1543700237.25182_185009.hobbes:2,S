Hi, thanks for taking the time to read this.
I have been experimenting between 2.4.23 and 2.6.0-test{5,6,7,8,9,10,11} 
and now 2.6.0.
Starting with -test11, I noticed often that I could not perform a 
startx, and as root got permission denied trying to execute or even list 
some files. I also notice this in 2.6.0. Dropping back to 2.4.23, I can 
perform the mentioned actions.
My motherboard is an Asus A7M266-D, and I run two AMD XP 1800+ CPU's. I 
am using a Seagate ST3120023A IDE disk drive.
Here is what I'm seeing in logs:
Dec 18 22:29:40 localhost kernel: blk: queue dfd8fc00, I/O limit 4095Mb 
(mask 0xffffffff)
Dec 18 22:29:40 localhost kernel: hda: dma_intr: status=0x58 {

Dec 18 22:29:40 localhost kernel: ide0: Drive 0 didn't accept speed 
setting. Oh, well.

Here is what i'm passing to 2.6.0 via grub:
root=/dev/hda6 ide0=autotune ide1=autotune
The kernel claims the reiserfs partitions are "3.6" format.
Any other information I can give to assist?
