Therein lies a key problem.  Turning on all of AHCI's aggressive power 
management features DOES save a lot of power.  But at the same time, it 
shortens the life of your hard drive, particularly hard drives that are 
really PATA, but have a PATA<->SATA bridge glued on the drive to enable 
connection to SATA controllers.
