It is simply my contention that you into at least a semi custom
configuration when you have multiple users with the same uid.
Especially when that uid == 0.
For guests you have to change the rule about what permissions
a setuid root executable gets or else it will have CAP_SYS_MKNOD,
and CAP_RAW_IO.  (Unless I didn't read that code right).
Plus all of the /proc and sysfs issues.
Now perhaps we can sit down and figure out how to get completely
isolated and only allow a new uid namespace when that is
the case, but that doesn't sound to interesting.
So at least until I can imagine what the semantics of a new uid
namespace are when we don't have perfect isolation that feels
like a job for a security module.
