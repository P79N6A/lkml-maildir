This makes you susceptible to TOCTTOU (race condition) attacks in some
cases.  Often, the only way to change ownership or permissions of a file
you want to operate on securely is to use fchown()/fchmod() etc.
It came as a surprise to me that open() + fchown()/fchmod() does not
work in some cases that chown()/chmod() do.  I wonder whether this has
any effect on applications.  Could this result in security holes in
applications that are unaware of this property?
