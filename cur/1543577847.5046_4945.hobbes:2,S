   (If you can't get to it, let me know and I'll email it to you...some
    cable modem networks have I firewalled.)
It just seems that this shows that the implementation of ifconfig can
be improved, since "ip" can do the same thing several orders of
magnitude better (ie. non-quadratic system time complexity).
This is the argument I started with when this thread began, so my
position hasn't changed, it has in fact been well supported by your
tests :-)
