   Here is the sparc64 part of the patch.  Please apply after Linus applies
   the gerneic part.
Thanks Stephen.
You know, you're doing such a good job with this, that you can
just stick the sparc64 parts into your main patch if you want.
You don't need to push it through me each time if you don't want.
