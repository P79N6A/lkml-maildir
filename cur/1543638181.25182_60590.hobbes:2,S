Are you referring to raising the per cpu array limit? I don't think you
tune that using /proc/slabinfo.  However that does not solve the problem,
it only delays it.  It needs to grow/shrink dynamically based on need. I
am not only referring to frequently draining of free objects but also
as a result of this refilling the object array due to subsequent
allocations and so on.
