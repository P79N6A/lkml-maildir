Subject: [RFC][PATCH 3/5] pagemap: remove open-coded sizeof(unsigned long)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/7/500

I think the code gets easier to read when we give symbolic names
to some of the operations we're performing.  I was sure we needed
this when I saw the header being built like this:
	...
	buf[2] = sizeof(unsigned long)
	buf[3] = sizeof(unsigned long)
I really couldn't remember what either field did ;(
