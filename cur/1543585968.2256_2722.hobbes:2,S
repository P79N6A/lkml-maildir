Hello, 
this is my very first mail into this list. If, please answer also to my mail 
address <th@visuelle-maschinen.de>. I have the following question and could 
not find any info about this matter in the web - maybe someone knows a link:
Porting the framebuffer driver i810fb to 2.4 I succeded loading it as a 
module. Compiling it into the kernel seems to be ok - but no Tux.
I found out, that agpgart, which is needed by i810fb, is initialized
_after_ i810fb setup. Therefore i810fb failes to initialize.
If I understand the kernel sources right, there is a function pointer list 
from __initcall_start for initializing compiled-in drivers. Unfortionately I 
could not discover how to control the sequence of this pointer list. The 
__initcall technique seems to be new in 2.4.  The same driver initializes 
correct on a 2.2.18 kernel.
In fact this seems to be a  general problem which, I guess, is already solved 
- but how?
Any hints are welcome - thanks in advance!
Thomas
