Jeff,
 can you plkease stop Cc'ing me on this thread?
No, nobody I know (certainly not me) is willing to re-license Linux under 
anything else than the GPL. Quite frankly, I suspect you'll have an easier 
time just rewriting the whole thing.
And no, the only offer from SCO I'm interested in is a public apology from
Darl McSwine.  Their made-up stories about copyright ownership weren't
really that amusing a year ago, and now they're boring and stale.
So please just remove me from the cc, ok?
		Linus
