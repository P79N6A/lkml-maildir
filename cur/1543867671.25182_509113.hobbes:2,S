That is more ideological question about micro-thread design at all.
If syslet will be able to perform only one syscall, one will have 4
threads for above case, not one, so it is even more broken.
So, if Linux moves that way of doing AIO (IMO incorrect, I think that
the correct state machine made not of syscalls, but specially crafted
entries - like populate pages into VFS, send chunk, recv chunk without
blocking and continue on completion and the like), syslets with attached 
state machines are the (smallest evil) best choice.

That is the case - atom items (I do hope that this subsystem would be
able to perform not only syscalls, but any kernel interfaces suitable
prototypes, v2 seems to move that direction) are called asynchronously 
from main userspace thread to achieve the maximum performance.
