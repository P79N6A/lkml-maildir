I think yes, because their misuse can trivially take down the
machine by definition. So it is still privileged in the context
of that system.

In such a system, sure you could make allowances by elevating
privileges or what have you.
I guess the tricky part is exactly how to make these allowances. I've
joined the thread too late (and don't have the knowledge) to really get
into that... but I just wanted to be clear that watering down SCHED_RR
and SCHED_FIFO basically just makes them no good to anyone.
I personally can't see how a scheduling policy can allow deterministic
access to the CPU without being a privileged operation. If you don't
need deterministic access to the scheduler, then let's talk about why
SCHED_OTHER isn't good enough. If you do, then we're talking about
security access I think.
