The only difference between SATA TCQ and PATA TCQ is that in PATA TCQ, the
drive doesn't report the active tag bitmap back to the host after each
command.  Other than that they are functionally identical to my
understanding.  (Yes, there are options like first-party DMA, but these are
not requirements)
Personally I'd like to see the option stay in there as experimental, it
helps us drive folks test stuff when we can just flip an option off/on to
get that functionality.

Yeah, that is correct. OTOH, it's not a great loss. The SATA tcq will be
much better, ide tcq is a really horrible beast.
