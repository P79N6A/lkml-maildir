If computing history has taught us anything, it is that you cannot
look into a crystal ball and tell what the future is going to be
like.
Be prepared.

The last 286s running SCO Xenix have been phased out
before Y2K -- yes, those machines had been running for
8 or more years, processing business-critical data and
vigorously shaking off the dust their contemporaries
had been gathering for years...
386s and 486s are still being used and supported,
the 386s are mostly found in embedded systems and
the 486s in slighly older but still fully functional
servers...
(and yes, they are actively being supported)
cheers,
Rik
