Aye, but softmodem drivers will be run on non-RTLinux systems.  Because
it's simply for users who want to use their winmodems.  And it would
like a bounded latency please during 99.9% of all seconds (hard RT not
strictly required).  None of this "I started netscape and the latencies
suddenly jumped 100 times".
