I've done some "research" on this during the night (trying out 2.4.21-pre3 with 
acpi-20030109, but without swsusp), and it seems to me, that a kind of "time-
corruption" occurs on boot. (Looking into the Bios-Setup before the time still 
seems to be ok, but when booting and logging in a time-step has occured) But I 
cannot make a general statement by now.
Any hints are very welcome
