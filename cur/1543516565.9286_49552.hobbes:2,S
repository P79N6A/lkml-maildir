There is a subtle problem: a rw semaphore is no real semaphore, it will
not support counts [at least if you base them on the rwlock asm code]:
semaphores allow a call to up() before the corresponding down(), eg
vfork() could do that [on SMP with an extremely long interrupt on the
line with the fork_out-label ;)
I would prefer if you use completely different function names to avoid
any confusion.
eg
acquire_shared()
acquire_exclusive()
release_shared()
release_exclusive()
