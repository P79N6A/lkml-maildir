I looked at other serial drivers and I could not find any other
drivers which accesses port->info in their ->get_mctrl(). This 
is why we fix this problem in 8250 driver. But if there is a
possibility that other drivers accesses port->info in their
->get_mctrl(), we should be fixing this in uart_read_proc(), as
you said.
How about the following patch? We've also confirmed the problem
is fixed by it.
Thanks,
Kenji Kaneshige
This patch fixes the problem that uninitialized (NULL) 'info' member
of uart_port structure can be accessed if serial driver is accessed
through /proc filesystem before uart_open(), which initializes the
'info' member', is called.
