Well, that's really usermode code, so I don't think we'd necessarily 
touch it at all.  It's not the same problem as the (single, at the 
moment) ring 0 use.

Yeah.  I guess the cleanest way to do that is do the paravirt 
substitution, and then nop it out later if it isn't needed in the vsyscall.

It's hardly a big deal either way.  There's only one in-kernel use of it.
