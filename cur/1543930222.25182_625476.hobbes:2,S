There was an attempt to write beyond the end of the device because
everything in the file-system was getting trashed. I can read/write
the 5 year-old SCSI physical drive with no errors from both within
linux and through the Adaptec BIOS. This problem only occurs
when I attempt to truncate a file that is being written by another
task.
