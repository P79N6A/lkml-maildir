Alan, I'm all dazed and confused about these patches:
arm-enable-arbitary-speed-tty-ioctls-and-split.patch
arm26-enable-arbitary-speed-tty-ioctls-and-split.patch
ia64-arbitary-speed-tty-ioctl-support.patch
xtensa-enable-arbitary-tty-speed-setting-ioctls.patch
h8300-enable-arbitary-speed-tty-port-setup.patch
m32r-enable-arbitary-speed-tty-rate-setting.patch
etrax-enable-arbitary-speed-setting-on-tty-ports.patch
v850-enable-arbitary-speed-tty-ioctls.patch
lots-of-architectures-enable-arbitary-speed-tty-support.patch
are there any interdependencies here, or can the various patches
go into the various trees in random order without ill effects?
Thanks.
