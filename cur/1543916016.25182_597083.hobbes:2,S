It still creeps me out that we have this sprinkled *all over* the tree and
people will forget to do it and there's no runtime or compile-time checking
that they remembered to do it and when they forget to do it nobody will
notice that it broke until ages and ages later.
IOW: it is a sheer horror for maintainability.
Please have a think about what we can do about this.  For example, if you'd
thought about this up-front, (and I think it's a big problem), we could
have done something grotty like, in mnt_want_write():
	current->vfsmnt_im_allowed_to_write_to = inode;
and then check that current->vfsmnt_im_allowed_to_write_to is the correct
inode in __mark_inode_dirty() and various other strategic places.  That
sort of thing.
We need to do *something*, I think.  This code just doesn't look feasibly
maintainable to me.
