Subject: [Q] int15h after kernel has booted

I need to generate an int15h after the kernel has booted. The BIOS only has
a real-mode verion of the function I want in this interrupt, so I can't use
an lcall to the protected mode BIOS like the APM code. I made the interrupt
in setup.S, but it seems I need to do it after each APM_SUSPEND as well, so
I still need some way of doing int15h after entering protected-mode.
Is there a proper method to drop the kernel into real-mode, do an interrupt
to the BIOS, then fall back into protected-mode?
If not it might be necessary to disassemble the BIOS by hand to see what it
does, and I want to avoid that at all costs.
