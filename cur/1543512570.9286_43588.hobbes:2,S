1. SCSI. And SCSI will need TONS on devices. You can not hot plug SCSI device,
but you can forgot to power on external ZIP or scaner. And from kernel
viewpoint it's no better then non-PnP ISA. Even much worse: just one zip drive
will need tens of "devices" to handle possible partition schemes.
2. USB, Firmware, wantever with removaible media
3. Devices, connected via parport (there EXISTS autodetection, but it does
not work for all printers/cdroms/zips, etc)

You know when it's notified right now with devfs, do you ? When user tries to
access non-existing file with mount() ... Only then module will be loaded,
special file will be created and mount() will successfully mount filesystem.
That is: notification even come from user who tries to use non-existing
device. Such event is possible to use with devfs but not with devd and
disk-based /dev ...

See above. Try to turn on printer, do `cat something > /dev/printer/0` with
devfs and explain how it'll be handled with devd.

It is. See above.
