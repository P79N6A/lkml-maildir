The second sentence was mangled when it was machine translated from the
original Klingon ;-)
Seriously, it doesn't parse. I can't decide if "when" in that sentence is
the wrong word, or if it snuck in uncapitalized and shouldn't be there at
all. I don't feel to "too" in the first sentence belongs, it doesn't refer
to several things.
