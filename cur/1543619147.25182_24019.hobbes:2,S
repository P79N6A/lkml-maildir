It was 15 by the time I tried it, but I'm still running it. What sched is
in pre7ac1? I looked at the post Alan put up and didn't see it on the
first pass. The Jn scheduler and and low latency seem to play well with
rmap, but the -aa changes to enable better bdflush tuning work well. I
don't want to tune for dbench, but I don't want to ignore it, either.
