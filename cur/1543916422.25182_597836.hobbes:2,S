I do however not agree with Andrew's conclusion, as the memory is not
"used", so I wouldn't expect a memory leak. As soon as I turn swapping
off everything is loaded again, and works. If there was a leak it should
use the memory, shouldn't it?
If the problem would be 100% reproducible I could try without, but as
is, I have up to two weeks with 2-3 cycles daily (sometimes more, as I
receive untraceable SERR from my PCI-E WLAN after which I do not receive
interrupts any more - only a suspend/resume cycle helps...) before the
problem occurs.
Anyway, is there a way of unloading the module temporarily without
shutting X down?

Did it. As before, suspends, but when I resume, I hear the CD-ROM spin
up, the backlight comes on, and nothing more. The system is a Lenovo
Thinkpad T60 8744-4XG, BIOS 1.09.
