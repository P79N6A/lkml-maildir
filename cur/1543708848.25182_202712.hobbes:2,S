I don't know this code, but if the current PC is at a given BP+1 you may need to 
back up the PC to point to the, now replaced, instruction.  You could verify 
this by looking, at this point, at what gdb has for the PC.  Odds are that it is 
either mid instruction or after the instruction that was replaced by the BP 
(depends on the relative length of the BP instruction and the replaced 
instruction).
