David and I went back and forth on that a little.  My hope is that
most platforms will have a reasonable way (i.e. no pci_device needed)
to ensure ordering.  I'm only aware of two platforms at the moment
that have i/o ordering issues: mips64 and ia64/sn.  On the former, a
simple 'sync' instruction is sufficient to barrier i/o, while on the
latter, a read from the local numa hub suffices.
If only a few platforms need info about which busses have outstanding
i/o, it should be possible to build a list of bridge chips or devices
and loop, reading from each (where presumably the read would act as
the barrier op).
If, OTOH, there are lots of platforms that need a pci_device so they
can read from a corresponding bridge to ensure ordering, it would be a
good idea to add an argument to the macro, as David initially
suggested.
Thoughts?
