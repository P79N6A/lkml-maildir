Apologies if you seen this already but it seems the list ate my previous 
replies...
My touchpad works well in relative mode, it's new synaptics driver code 
in 2.5 that switches the touchpad in absolute mode that gives me trouble. 
Right now in stock kernel synaptics driver does not register with 
mousedev and only provides /dev/input/eventX interface. I want it to also 
plug in into /dev/input/mouseX and /dev/psaux so programs that do not 
have special code for event processing could still use it. The problem 
is that conversion from absolute to relative mode in mousedev isn't 
working well for touchpads. When to take your finger off touchpad and
touch it in other place mousedev does not account for that and calculates
huge delta which causes your cursor to jump.
