Neither actually, the individual core idle times reported via `/proc/stat'
are off by 20 percent, one over estimates and the other under estimates
and the sum is right on the mark.

It's somewhat documented on the page: 
http://www.boblycat.org/~malc/apc
Anyway the left bar is based on information from `/proc/stat' the right
one is derived from the kernel module that just times how much time was
spent in idle handler. The graphs: red - `/proc/stat', yellow - module.

I don't really use `getrusage'.
