I havent seen it, but the matrox fbdev can do things like turning the
legacy vga and/or bios off.  (it makes sense on secondary cards)
There is the warning that such a card may need a power-off in
order to recover. I.e. ordinary reboot won't help.

Great. It wasn't always so in the early 1990's. I once had a pc I had
to turn off whenever the os/2 video driver died.  The pc would restart
using the reset button too, but the screen was black unless I powered
it off.

A driver supporting a modern video card may not be easy - supporting
mode changes _only_ (and use fbconsole for unaccelerated graphichs) 
would likely be easy enough if stupid vendors didn't withold 
information. I cannot imagine a trade secret in the mode change
programming.

I know. I tried, and it failed. :-/

That works, but doing all that pci disabling looks like a silly 
limitation to me.  Of course it is necessary if no driver exists, but
then I wouldn't buy that card for a linux machine in the first place.

What I want is to run two xservers on different screens.  Two processes 
so they may run simultaneosly. And they shouldn't need to wait for each 
other because the hardware itself don't need that.
