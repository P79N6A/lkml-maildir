I was concerned that too much memory might be consumed by the kernel. 
I'd like to seee some kind of auto-expire negative entries. I took the
easiest way out. We should do better.

Here is a patch for the problem. It may not solve all cases. But I
think it covers most ones.

I see 1.5.x as alpha. Nothing is final yet. The reason I like it is it
gets rid of /var/lib/nfs/rmtab. However, that means we have to find a
way for kernel to communicate to mountd. Maybe RPC is a better choice.
Anyone wants to implement it?
Thanks.
