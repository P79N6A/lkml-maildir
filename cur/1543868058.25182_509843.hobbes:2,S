Since I lost the email where you were describing the todo list, I'll hook 
into this one.
I haven't seen you mentioning it, but at least TID and signal handling 
need to be swapped to. So it'd be better to have a generic 
move_user_context() that does system independent work, and an 
arch_move_user_context() that takes care of system dependent stuff (that 
is called by move_user_context()).
