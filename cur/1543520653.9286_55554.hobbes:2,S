     I'm sorry I don't remember where, bugtrack I think, but a buffer overflow
exploit for BIND was just recently posted which just recently necessitated yet
another upgrade, and I know quite a few people that got nailed by it.
     If you set it up to run non-root; it would still be possible to get a
shell under that UID and clobber files that BIND manipulates; not to mention
that it would give you an inside position from which to launch further attacks.

     I've been doing this for decades not years, and constantly the software
_is_ getting fixed; but it never arrives at that state.  Why?  Because
protocols, features, etc evolve, people are always adding new functionality,
new bugs are created as fast if not faster than old ones are destroyed.

     One could make the same argument for a root password.  It's another layer,
one more thing to have to get around.  Absolute security doesn't exist.
