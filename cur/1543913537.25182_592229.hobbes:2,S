Dmitry - have now worked out at least one alternative keymap - for
European keyboards. But could you explain the above point? I have to
admit I am not too familiar with the input layer - having really taken
an old, and bit rot infested 2.4 driver and brought it up to standard
for 2.6 - and so I don't follow this point too well!
Can I treat keymaps as firmware and load from userspace? Or is there a
way of making this completely user configurable at runtime?
Any help from you, or any other reader, much appreciated.
Adrian
