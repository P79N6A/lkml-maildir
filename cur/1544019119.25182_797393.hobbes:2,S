Hmm. That delete of the empty file is "correct" (and probably came as a 
result of somebody doing "make distclean" which deletes empty files), but 
should not have been committed as part of "libata-sff: fix incorrect EH 
message".
Seems to be a mistake, and a small one, but still.. Be more careful.
