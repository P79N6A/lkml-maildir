Tungsten might like to think your end users are morons, but we like to
believe our end-users (ie, ANYONE building their own kernel) have
a small amount of common sense.  For those that find themselves lacking
in this area, they can usually buy some by using a vendor kernel.
If you believe that end-users aren't smart enough to figure out where to
get a kernel with all the bits they need, what makes you think they're
smart enough to figure out they need to grab the dri bits from the dri
sourceforge site (or wherever the hell they are) ?
For the record, the dri part is all thats missing in 2.6.8.1
Had it been merged sooner[1], it would work out of the box today with
that file that you downloaded. The AGPGART support for i915 has been
there for ages.
