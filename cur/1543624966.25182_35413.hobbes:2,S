It depends on which version of make you are using.  make 3.78 onwards
has a built in job scheduler which shares the value of -j across its
children, yea unto the nth generation.  Earlier versions of make did a
simplistic 'run -j copies of make at the top level' and did not
propagate -j to the lower levels.
With the recursive makefiles and make < 3.78 you need MAKE="make -j" to
get a decent speedup because of the lack of choices at the top level
Makefile.  With make >= 3.79 you do not need MAKE="make -j14", it can
interfere with make's own scheduler.  See also make -l LOAD.
