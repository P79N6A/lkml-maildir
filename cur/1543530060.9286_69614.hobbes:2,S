That's true. I run "standard" kernels, and they have _an_ OOM killer
that seems to be random! Whether it's _the_ OOM killer or not, I don't

I have heard only good things about _your_ OOM killer. It's simply
that I can't try it because the only viable test is on production
machines, and I can't run those as testbeds.
