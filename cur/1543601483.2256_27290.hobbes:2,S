I just tried the 'Athlon Bug stomper #2 bit 7 patch version 1' on a 2nd
matchine, 900 MHz Duron system with an Epox 8KTA3+ MB, and it too
is now running fine with an Athlon optimized kernel, when before it
would oops to death on boot.
Shall I keep posting success reports or are people convinced this
fix works?
