kmsgdump for Linux 2.5.65/2.5.66
2003-03-31
version 0.4.5
kmsgdump home:  
http://w.ods.org/tools/kmsgdump/
 (Willy Tarreau)
my kmsgdump patches:  
http://www.xenotime.net/linux/kmsgdump/
'kmsgdump-2565.diff' applies cleanly to Linux 2.5.65 and with
just a few patch offsets to Linux 2.5.66.
Tested on P4 UP and P4 SMP (Linux 2.5.65/66).
======================================================================
kmsgdump is a Linux kernel patch for x86 that can be used to dump the
contents of the kernel log buffer to a floppy disk or to a printer
(one that the system BIOS knows about) after a kernel panic happens.
======================================================================
caveats:
1.  This version of kmsgdump doesn't support kernel log buffers of more
than 60 KB (due to x86 real-mode segment addressing).  However, the
kernel log buffer is currently always a power of 2 (like 16 or 32 or
64 KB), so a 32 KB log buffer is the largest that is currently supported.
2.  The kmsgdump text-mode interface doesn't work with a USB-only keyboard
setup.  I had to add a PS/2 keyboard to my test system to use it.
======================================================================
TODO:
1.  Limit LOG_BUF_LEN to 60 KB then fix this limit by having a moving
    segment register value
