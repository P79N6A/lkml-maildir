I am very sorry for all linux developers and also all linux users in France but the french government has officially considered the internet as a threat to the french language and seems to be trying to minimize internet use in France.

Having the kernel support encryption (even the crippled 56Bit DES) would be appreciated by many users and developers but would render linux illegal because of the french encryption policy which is POLITIC.
