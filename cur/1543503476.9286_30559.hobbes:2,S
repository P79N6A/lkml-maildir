I recall reading something about in-memory kernel replacement, which
might solve this problem. I don't know what's the status of this
project, or if it's even active, but I imagine that the running kernel
can be made to have a list of active kernel images so that when a
process makes a transition to kernel mode, the appropiate kernel image
can be paged in. Each task_struct could have a field indicating which
kernel will service it. This would probably lead to the need to have
some structs in fixed memory locations, or something. It would allow
hot-swap kernels ;-D
I think I heard sometime ago that VMS had this capability. Imagine...
[root@pcmaster /root]# uptime
  2:04pm  up 3425 days,  3:50,  1 user,  load average: 0.07, 0.12, 0.18
Does anybody know or have heard anything about this project?
