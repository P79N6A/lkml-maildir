I would not do that. It makes too much of the oops scroll away.

I think this needs much more sanity checking, otherwise the risk
of recursive oops etc is too big.
I would always check first if the stack value read from ebp is inside the 
stack page of the current process. If you're paranoid you could even use 
__get_user() to catch exceptions.
