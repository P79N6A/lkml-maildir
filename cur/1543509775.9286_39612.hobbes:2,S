Simple patch that takes all the as86/ld86 stuff in arch/i386/boot and
makes it use standard GNU as/ld. Needs a minimum of binutils-2.9.1.0.7,
but that's it (that was the minimum per Documentation/Changes for 2.2
already).

I know that this is 2.5 material now, but I would like some heavy testing
esp. by people who use CONFIG_VIDEO_SELECT -- the rewritten video.S
*cannot* be completely tested just by me alone.. I need to know if any of
the detection routines went south with my meddling. 
Thanks.
