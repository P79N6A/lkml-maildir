Yes, it is true. But I don't mind only kdb and kdump co-exist.

I agreed with him and I made new notifier function that users can change
the order. Priority value in notifier blocks are hardcoded. If users want to
change list order, they have to rebuild kernel. I think it is very unhappy.
This is our discussion.

In addition, we can use new notifier function to reboot_notifier, die_chain
if users want to use.
