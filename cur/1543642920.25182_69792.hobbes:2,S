I'm not sure what this is intended to communicate.
The question was specifically regarding filesystem support, so I'll
assume you meant to point out that XFS does not always work like it
should.
Then, am I incorrect that since almost all of XFS that's left to merge
is XFS code and not changes to the kernel at large?
If this is correct, could I then make the assumption that merging XFS
would be minimally impactful for those kernel user who do not enable it?
Linus incorporated reiserfs long before it "always functioned as it is
supposed to", so I find myself wondering where your point was.
(see below) and "^^^^^^^^^^^^^" don't fully cover your thoughts I'm
afraid.
