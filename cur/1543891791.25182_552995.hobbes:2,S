No, you want them associated with the level you bail out *TO*.  Otherwise you
get this:
	...
	...
	if (..) {
		if (..) {
			goto ka_blammo;
	...
	foo = yadda_yadda(.....);
	kfree(bar->some_struct);
			ka_blammo:
	/* continue with cleanup here */
Goto labels belong in column 1.  Or 2 if you believe in the existence of 'diff
-p' that get confused by col-1 labels.
