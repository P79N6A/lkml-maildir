Hi,
We are running Linux kernel 2.2.14 on RH 6.1, on a Quantum atlas 10K ultra-160.
It works fine connected to a 2940u2w, but connected to aic-7892b 
(ultra-160) we get a lot of scsi bus resets.
Has anyone tried this configuration before (ultra-160 and atlas10K)?
Thanks for your help in advance.
Bye,
                    Mariella
