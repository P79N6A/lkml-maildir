For those wondering what was causing this. After recovering the whole 
disk, this is what ddrescue could not recover:
	Bad region size 32768 at position 4096
	Bad region size 4096 at position 49152
	Bad region size 57344 at position 32083968
	...
Now, the kernel was able to read the first 512 bytes fine. But fdisk 
apparently reads at first 512 bytes and then reads 8kB. Since this second 
read fails it bails out. (I'm not sure why it does a second 8kB read 
though).
But that's why the partition table was actually fine (and the kernel did 
not complain about it) but the disk apparently seemed more dead than it 
actually was. Well, not that the disk is useful now, but at least I 
recovered most of it.
	Total of 103 good regions representing 160058684 kB. 99.983%
	Total of 100 bad regions representing 10020 kB. 0.006%
	Total of 3 dangling regions representing 17824 kB. 0.011%
	Total of 0 unknown regions representing 0 kB. 0.000%
	Total of 20040 bad blocks
fsck had a lot of issues, but everything I still required that wasn't on 
my last backup has been restored succesfully.
Kind regards,
