Dear all,
 We are pleased to announce releasing new function of Linux
Kernel State Tracer(a.k.a. LKST).
 It's a lkstlogtools for analyzing performance of kernel.
This function is released as lkstlogtools v1.0.1.
For using this function, LKST v2.2.1 is needed.
Please use this tool and give us some comment.
---
The development of this program is partly supported by IPA
(Information-Technology Promotion Agency, Japan).
---
 LKST with lkstlogtools can collect the queue information and
the execution time of some key processing and analyze them.
lkstlogtools provides some tools for analyzing and visualizing LKST
data too.
From these analyzed data, user can know what processing is slow
and the status of the queue at the time.
Thus user can use LKST with lkstlogtools as a tool to evaluate
kernel performance.
---
lkstlogtools and LKST binaries, source code and documents are
available in the following site,
http://sourceforge.net/projects/lkst/
http://sourceforge.jp/projects/lkst/
We prepared a mailing list written below in order to let users know
update of LKST.
 lkst-users@lists.sourceforge.net

And if you have any comments, please send to the above list, or to
another mailing-list written below.

Best regards,
All of the LKST developers
