Excuse me, but exactly how did you gather I needed to set the root device? 
This image works on floppy, but not when it is tftp'd by the nic.  (I did
everything I could to get this far before I decided to send a message.  Now
that it is tftp'ing the image and not working, I'm confused!)

The nic says 'Transfering ...'  sorry, forgot the full message.  The next
thing is 8000 line after line.  There's no message from the kernel image. 
As the previous guy said, it's trying to read the rest of itself from floppy
and not realize it is already in memory.
