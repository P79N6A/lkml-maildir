Hi. I've had trouble with my ALPS touchpad on my Acer Aspire, ever
since ALPS support was merged into the kernel. I've tried various
kernels from 2.6.11-rc3 to -rc5 (including some -mm kernels) and none
of them detect the pad. After sprinkling some printk's in the mouse
drivers, it seems like psmouse_connect in psmouse-base.c is never even
called. 
On the other hand, using earlier kernels (such as 2.6.9) with the
kernel patch from Peter Osterlund's driver package works fine. In that
case, I get lines like this in syslog:
kernel: alps.c: E6 report: 00 00 64
kernel: alps.c: E7 report: 73 02 14
kernel: alps.c: E6 report: 00 00 64
kernel: alps.c: E7 report: 73 02 14
kernel: alps.c: Status: 15 01 0a
kernel: ALPS Touchpad (Glidepoint) detected
kernel: input: AlpsPS/2 ALPS TouchPad on isa0060/serio4
With the newer kernels, there's nothing ALPS-related in the log. Any
pointers on what to look for would be appreciated. My kernel config is
at

Thanks,
Johan
