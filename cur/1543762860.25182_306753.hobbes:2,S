You need to consider that in the end I'd need PT_GNU_STACK to do
everything PaX wants, and to make PF_X a tristate (On, Off, Neutral)
which mapped to PF_PAGEEXEC in PaX.  In other words, I'd have to
overhaul and most likely *break* everything else that relied on
PT_GNU_STACK, instead of passively adding logic for PT_PAX_FLAGS and
letting everyone else catch up at their leisure.
I'd rather not break anything and force everyone to upgrade *now*; but
instead add PT_PAX_FLAGS functionality for mainline/ES, let it lay there
for a year or so as people start moving over and accepting it, let the
kernel devs decide when it's time to depricate PT_GNU_STACK, and see it
naturally decay away once it's actually no longer needed.  The point is
to not break anything, yet to still make things easier for those
projects and distributions like Hardened Ubuntu.
