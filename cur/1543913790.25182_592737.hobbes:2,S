I think it would be good to always print out that number, even if
it is zero without the CONFIG option set.
Changing the format of /proc/stat depending on config options is
probably worse than changing it when moving kernel versions.
I guess reusing the "steal" field is not a good idea, since your
new "guest time" has different semantics than the steal time field.
