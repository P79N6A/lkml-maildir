Features such as ACLs and SELinux are still not on by default and are
most *definitely* used.  This is a bogus argument.

No.  I don't see it ever being forced on in the kernel by default, so
there will be no such "stealth upgrades".
Rather, if it is "made default", that will be done by setting the flag
by default on newly-created filesystems in mke2fs.  We won't be playing
magic on existing filesystems.
And to avoid confusion, I am *entirely* open to the idea of making it
only ever default to on in mke2fs at some point in the future where we
batch a set of incompat features with the "ext4" label, so that "mke2fs
-O ext4", or "mke4fs", would set it.  That has already been proposed on
ext2-devel; we're nowhere near the stage of making that default yet.
