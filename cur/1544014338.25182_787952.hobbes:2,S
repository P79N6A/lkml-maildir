It's not livelocky because it no longer has to do repeated passes
over the superblock list. It is subject to the single inode syncing
issue where it can get stuck behind a process dirtying memory (same
as fsync) but we've decided not to add complexity to improve that
just yet, and see whether it turns out to be a real problem.

sys_sync B which is invoked *after* sys_sync caller A should not
return before A. If you didn't have a global lock, they'd tend to
block one another's pages anyway. I think it's OK.
