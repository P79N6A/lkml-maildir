Could you please do two tests (you can do these at the same time, and in
fact it might be easier, if #2 causes your machine to boot up):
 - Please enable debugging in PCI (both in drivers/pci/pci.c and in
   arch/i386/kernel/pci-i386.h), and post a full printout.
 - leave the "pci_enable_device()" line intact, but do not do a "return"
   on failure (so if pci_enable_device() fails for some reason, we still
   do the rest of the setup).
Thanks,
		Linus
