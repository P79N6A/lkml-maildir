Just for the record: the "SMP race condition" argument given here is
completely bogus. sleep_on_* is quite safe to use when the SMP races are
being handled using the BKL, as is the case here.
That said, I agree that the patch is of interest given the long term
goal of removing the BKL completely. Perhaps you could therefore also
amend your changelog entry text to reflect this motive?
Cheers,
