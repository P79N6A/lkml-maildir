Then the snapshot robot will continue to make them available for
non-bk users at 
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/projects/sparse
Right now, it deletes snapshots after a week. I figure anyone who wanted
to find regressions, or step back through the history could extract it
from the bk web frontend (or use bk).  If anyone would prefer me to keep
them there longer, shout and I'll change the script.
