Subject: Tasklets vs. Task Queues for Deferred Processing

I'm trying to defer some processing to a later point.  I'm in a softirq,
so in_interrupt() returns true.  I need to schedule some work for later,
in process context.  I have read in the O'Reilly linux device drivers
book that tasklets always run in interrupt time.  Also, I guess the only
task_queue that is in process context is the scheduler task queue.  I've
seen in a few places that task queues are on their way out and tasklets
are being used instead.  Is this completely true?  Should I consider
task queues as a deprecated method of deferred processing?`  What other
deferred processing methods can I use that will run in process context?
Thanks,
	Josh
