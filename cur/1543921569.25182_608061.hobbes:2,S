Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patchset defines a 32-bit boot protocol for x86 platform,
adds an extensible boot parameter passing mechanism, export the boot
parameters via sysfs.
The patchset has been tested against kernel of git version
v2.6.23-6623-g55b70a0 on x86_64 and i386.
This patchset is based on the proposal of Peter Anvin.
v6:
- The linked list of setup_data is copied to memory area right after
  the kernel _end during early kernel bootstrap to solve the issue
  that where the safe place is to place linked list of setup_data.
v5:
- Use bt_ioremap/bt_iounmap in copy_setup_data.
v4:
- Reserve setup_data and boot parameters for accessing during
  runtime.
- Export boot parameters via sysfs.
v3:
- Move hd0_info and hd1_info back to zero page for compatibility.
v2:
- Increase the boot protocol version number
- Check version number before parsing setup data.
- Revise zero page description according to the source code and move
  them to zero-page.txt.
Best Regards,
Huang Ying
