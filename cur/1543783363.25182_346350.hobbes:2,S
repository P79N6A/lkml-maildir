Well, an EtherDrive blade just copies the ATA identify response data
into a network packet without looking at it.  The vblade, though, has
to set the lba_capacity and lba_capacity_2 fields itself.
The aoe driver looks OK, but it turns out there's a byte swapping bug
in the vblade that could be related if he's running the vblade on a
big endian host (even though he said it was an x86 host), but I
haven't heard back from the original poster yet.
The vblade bug was the omission of swapping the bytes in each short.
The fix below shows what I mean:
