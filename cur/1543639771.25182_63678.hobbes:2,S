I pointed out before the null check was flawed. And all I see is the
same identical patch churned out again. Regardless of whether that
paticular stupid error was in the old code, not fixing it in the new
code when its pointed out is a bit of a mess.
I'm not sure its a simplification either. More function pointers don't
always make for neater - but thats a side issue. If the NULL check goes
I'm not too worried about the other stuff.
