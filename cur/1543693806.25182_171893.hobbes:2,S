CA-Staff/Senior Engineer: Linux TCP/IP Stack Development
SecureAll Inc., headquartered in the Silicon Valley, California, is a 
well-funded start-up in the Enterprise Information Security domain. 
It is well recognized that enterprises are on the average 6 months 
behind on applying security patches. During this period, despite 
employing firewalls and intrusion detection systems, enterprises 
are vulnerable to exploits leveraging the un-patched weaknesses. 
It is also acknowledged that patch management is an imperfect science
and does not take away the risk of applying patches without adequate 
testing. SecureAll offers a solution that is truly radical and solves
the above problems in an elegant fashion. The foundation of the company
is based on a patented breakthrough technology that takes network-based
enterprise security to the next level. 
We are currently looking to fill one full-time regular positions in our 
San Jose, CA facility  requiring extensive experience with TCP/IP 
protocol stack development.  
Staff/Senior-Engineer: TCP/IP Protocol Stack Development 
* 5-10 years of experience in the design, implementation, and 
  ongoing development of TCP/IP protocol stack. At least 1 year 
  recent development experience with Linux TCP/IP protocol stack.
* Extensive Kernel Software development and debugging experience 
  preferably in Linux environment.
* Good Understanding of memory management, SMP, clustering issues is a
  plus.
* Experience with the hardening of kernel and various protocol stacks 
  for security is a plus.
* Experience with design and architecture of mid- to large-sized 
  software projects.
