one of the most frequent exceptions to the 'up in a separate function' 
rule are seqfile implementations, which all have start(), mid(), stop() 
methods, where start() does the down(), stop() does the up(). These can 
still be converted to mutexes (and i converted a couple of them), after 
manual review.

another good sign of completion type of semaphores is the use of 
DECLARE_MUTEX_LOCKED(), init_MUTEX_LOCKED(), or sema_init(&sem, 0). In 
95% of these cases these signal semaphores used as completions. That is 
one reason why i did not add DEFINE_MUTEX_LOCKED(), nor 
mutex_init_locked() to the mutex APIs.
the 'struct work' conversion is rare, i've only seen it in XFS so far.
