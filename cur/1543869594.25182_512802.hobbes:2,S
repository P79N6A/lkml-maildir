The big news today is that live migration works with kvm (kvm-14 could 
do live migration, but only with -no-kvm).  See 
http://kvm.qumranet.com/kvmwiki/Migration
 for instructions.
Changes from kvm-14:
- live migration with kvm (Uri Lublin)
   - based on Anthony Liguori's qemu patches
- new userspace interface (work in progress)
- the usual random fixes
Note that if you use the modules from Linux 2.6.20, you need to use
kvm-12.  You can use kvm-15 with Linux 2.6.20, provided you use the
external module included in kvm-15.  API/ABI stability is planned for
Linux 2.6.21.
