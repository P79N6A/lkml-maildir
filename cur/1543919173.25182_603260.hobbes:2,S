You have two copies of that comment; I'd drop this one, and add a
better one around CF initialization.
What I'd have here is a comment that this symbol is exported ONLY
for use by the EHCI driver, trespassers will be violated, etc.

That deserves a comment about how CF and companion port resets
don't mix well.
... assuming this does check out as the problem, which I expect
it will.
