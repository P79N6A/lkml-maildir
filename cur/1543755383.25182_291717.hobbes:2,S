Humm.. compiles ok here.
I just rebuilt a vanilla 2.6.11-rc2-bk9 tree, applied the patches, 
selected CONFIG_SND_DEBUG and CONFIG_SND_DEBUG_MEMORY, and it compiled 
just fine.
I had already tested the patches with an allyesconfig, but tested it 
anyway just to be sure.
Are you sure you also applied the first patch in the series that creates 
the kstrdup library function? If you are, can you send me your .config 
so that I can test it here?
