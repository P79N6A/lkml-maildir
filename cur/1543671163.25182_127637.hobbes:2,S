It does work with wine - but it's sad how horrible the command line tools
are (they were apparently first done under UNIX, and then ported to 
Windows, and they got the Windows command line interface and trying to use 
them in a sane way with Wine is not exactly much fun).
But yes, with Wine and a few scripts you can actually make the tools 
usable under Linux - I tried them out and had a small silly "pong" game 
running on one of those things (a 100k device on one of the cheap 
development boards).
I have to admit that I would hate to actually use those tools for any real 
work, though.
