hi norbert!
ok ... i  tested it:
patch activted:
apm activated -> prozessor idle calls : 42°C when idle
acpi activated -> prozessor c1/c2 states: 35°C when idle
under load:
apm activated -> 47°C kernel compiling after 2 min
acpi activated -> 43°C kernel compiling after 2 min
(kernel compiling only lasts about 3 min ... so no larger load intervalls
are avaible at the moment ... )
so ... you could use apm ... but acpi proofs to be better in power saveing
with the "disconnectenable when STPGNT detected" bit set ...
maybe apm is not working at all .. .cause at the moment i see that the
temperature does not drop at all after finishing the kernel ... it looks
like that the 42°C only where cause it was fresh rebooted from the acpi
power saving mode
