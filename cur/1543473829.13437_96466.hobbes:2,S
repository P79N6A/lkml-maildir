Is this the RDTSC problem?
With 2.2.0pre2, on a 6x86MX I get a boot failure with a message to the
effect of not having a "good RDTSC", but 2.2.0pre1-ac4 is fine.
UP with CONFIG_CPU is set to PPro/K6/6x86MX
                                         ^^
   since that what my cpu _claims_ to be ;-).
OTOH, If this is something else, scream and I'll go back and get the
real console dump, .config etc.
TTFN
