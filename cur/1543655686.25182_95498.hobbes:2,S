And it looks like the mechanism that drm uses for quering agp doesn't return 
the string in question.  (I don't really understand the mechanism these two 
modules use to talk to each other).
In any case I don't think the string in the informational is very useful -- 
it's a potentially inaccurate translation of state from *another* module, so 
I'm just removing the lot.
