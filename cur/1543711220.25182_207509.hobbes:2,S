It'll fix known problems in the microcode thats in ROM on your CPU.

In most cases, yes.  It's zero cost. You don't waste RAM, as the
microcode gets loaded into small RAM areas on the CPU that are
otherwise unused.

yes. You need at least a Pentium Pro.
Also Pentium 4 needs a newer format microcode, which isn't available
publically anywhere yet afaik.

Some CPUs have more bugs that need fixing than others 8)
Additionally some CPUs may not have a newer microcode available
than the one that it shipped with in ROM

In some cases, your BIOS is doing this transparently already.
I've seen instances where moving a CPU between two motherboards
has meant that microcode_ctl has done an upgrade on one, and
done nothing on the other as its already up to date.
If you're already up-to-date, theres no reason to run it.
