If you find a BIOS it will be in 'C' and Intel asm. There's no way
anybody would have used AT&T (chicken v.s. egg problem).
I agree the code is a mess. Further:
o	There is no makefile.
o	There is no way to make the executable file that does something,
	possibly the final relocations and checksum (no source).
o	The 'ASM' sources will assemble. However, they don't link into
	a BIOS rom. Something is missing.
However, I have been able to extract useful information about the generic
floppy I/O and some other I/O.  The interrupt 0x15 stuff seems to
look reasonable. I think that I may be able to make a quick-boot BIOS
in a few weeks (actually longer because of necessary work-breaks).
I will keep everybody informed.
Cheers,
