Do not tweak your IDE controller pci latency without making a backup if
its anything but the base motherboard chipset. Not unless you make
backups first and test it very hard.
Its a particularly popular area for errata.
You could also try lower DMA modes, I don't know if that will help or
not but UDMA133 is essentially "one entire PCI 32/33Mhz bus worth of
traffic so the effects are not too suprising. IDE control ports can give
you long stalls too especially if IORDY is in use.
