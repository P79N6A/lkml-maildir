Thanks for the kmsg clairfication, Paul.

The particular host does not have X support so mpg is out.
I'm not sure that that test would work as mplayer requires filenames
as command arguments not stdin (exclusivly, I think); my guess
is mplayer would try to decode stdin.
this works fine
mplayer `cat zz.mtest `
Then I tried
mplayer /dev/stdin <zz.mtest
I got
Failed to open /dev/rtc: Permission denied (it should be readable by the user.)
so what the heck, I changed it...
$ ls -l /dev/rtc 
crw-rw----    1 root     root      10, 135 Mar 14  2002 /dev/rtc
chmod o+r /dev/rtc
Then I tried
while read file; do mplayer "$file" ; done <zz.mtest
and got
Linux RTC init error in ioctl (rtc_irqp_set 1024): Permission denied
Try adding "echo 1024 > /proc/sys/dev/rtc/max-user-freq" to your system startup 
scripts.
the file almost played though...
Playing /usr/nfs/sandbox/media/audio/_the-party-has-just-begun/Lebanese_Blonde.ogg.
Ogg file format detected.
...
But it seemed to take keyboard commands from the binary
No bind found for key _

and quit.  I tried the sysctl suggestion, no change, whenever a file list
is redirected to stdin, and a filename argument is given to mplayer, eg
while read file; do mplayer "$file" ; done <zz.mtest
now I don't have rtc errors but mplayer is getting strange input it
doesn't grok.
Once again, this works fine without the changed rtc perms or the sysctl
echo:
mplayer `cat zz.mtest`
I've not had a chance to properly test - I still think there is a new
kernel bug/feature but cant find time to properly track it down.
