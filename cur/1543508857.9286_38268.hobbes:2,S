I use the stable kernel too, and I am not a newbie, but that's
beside the point.

well we are in competition with other OSes too, but that aside

it would be better to modify e2fsck to be able to run fsck on a
mounted filesytem. makeing it more like umssync under a umsdos
fs.

make -j bzImage 
will test your memory, trust me I found this out and was able to
fix my problem by slowing down the reads in the bios. believe it
or not gcc is one of the better memeory testors.

netstat is not enough?

some distros have them and more...

I have to agree.
