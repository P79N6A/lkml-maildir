Some of those are the reason I moved part of the x86 irq.c code to PPC
indeed.

And I think they are. One thing is that if made "common", do_IRQ have to
be split into an arch-specific function that retrives the irq_number (and
does the ack on some controller), and the actual "dispatch" function that
does all the flags game and calls the handler.
I've slightly extended it using the IRQ_PERCPU flag to prevent IRQ_INPROGRESS
from ever beeing set (a bit hackish but I wanted that for IPIs since they
use ordinary irq_desc structures for us in most cases).
Ben.
