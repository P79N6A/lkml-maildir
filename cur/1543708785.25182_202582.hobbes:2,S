Well, I would usually except the user knows what he does, but okay, if
you think that's safer. It requires the user to carry the size of the
buffer around. Assuming he kmallocs the buffer in one function with the
correct size and wants to use it in another function (a mempool or
something, who knows). He doesn't know the size of the buffer there.

It may, yes. But I don't think this kind of thing is done elsewhere in
the kernel. It's okay for things like user space libraries where the
libraries and users can be compiled separately to catch problems with
ABI changes, but in the kernel? I think it's overkill.
These things should be caught using BUG_ONs if you thing someone might
get them wrong somehow und in the future if something changes. But now
if they add additional parameters.

Ok, I see.
We could add some functions so that everything is symmetric:
(the names with a star are already existing)
*crypto_alloc_tfm
\_ crypto_init_tfm
*crypto_free_tfm
\_ crypto_release_tfm
crypto_clone_tfm
\_ crypto_copy_tfm
crypto_get_alg_size
\_crypto_get_tfm_size
crypto_init_tfm does everything but the kmalloc
crypto_release_tfm everything but the kfree
So crypto_alloc_tfm and crypto_release_tfm can be changed to call
crypto_init_fdm and crypto_release_tfm plus crypto_get_alg_size/kmalloc
and kfree.
crypto_clone_tfm calls crypto_get_tfm_size, kmalloc and crypto_copy_tfm.
crypto_copy_tfm copies the tfm structure, cares about algorithm
reference counting and calls a (new) copy method. This copy method
should copy things in its context like kmalloc'ed structures (or
increment a reference count if it's a static memory structure or
something). (however kmalloc's should be avoided if possible, the
variable sized context provides some flexibility)
crypto_get_alg_size returns the size of the tfm structure when algorithm
name and flags are given, crypto_get_tfm size returns the size of an
existing tfm structure.
So we can also directly initialize a tfm structure on a stack, not only
copy it to a stack. Very flexible.
What do you think?
