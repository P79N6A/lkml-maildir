Well, this is kind of my own fault.  I didn't want the dirty_inode call
back to be able to screw with the internals of how inode.c dealt with
things, I wanted it purely to allow actions in addition to what inode.c
wanted to do.
So, mark_inode_dirty calls dirty_inode, and then it sets whatever dirty
bits it wants to.  Clearing them in your own dirty_inode call won't matter,
they should just get set again later.
If we really want to leave the inode clean,  fsync isn't as much of a
concern as O_SYNC writes, since you want generic_osync_inode to properly
flush the updated inode.  But, that can be dealt with by having your
commit_write func test for O_SYNC.
What we can't get around is our friend knfsd, who uses write_inode_now.
The I_DIRTY bit needs to be accurate there (although it doesn't seem
perfect right now anyway).
The real problem I see is that we've overload the sync flag to write_inode.
It means flush now to get the data safe, and flush now to free ram.
Normally this kind of overloading is ok, but once logging comes into play I
believe a distinction is needed.
So, my current plan to fix reiserfs_write_inode is to do nothing when
current->flags & PF_MEMALLOC == 1.  I'm not wild about it, but don't see
many other fixes that don't involve api changes.  
I'd rather not do a private inode list until there is a clean way to apply
memory pressure to it, since reiserfs pins enough memory as it is.
