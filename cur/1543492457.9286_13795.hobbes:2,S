I agree with what you've said in this post, Dan.  I'd like to add one
comment:  I have a feeling that a lot of those posting their opinions
haven't really read up properly on capabilities, what they are, so forth.
You know who you are!  There is good documentation right in the kernel
source, and if you search the web, I read an excellent paper on how it all
works a few months back.  I can't seem to locate it now though.  Search for
it.
