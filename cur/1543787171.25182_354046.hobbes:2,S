Where in what I said above do I say that it will _not_
work with _other_ MPT based drivers?  Nowhere!
Yes it _will_ work with other MPT-like drivers but
to cut and paste again from above:
 * MPT based only,
 * doesn't follow a spec to save its life,
 * far inferior in SAS capabilities and SAS representation
   again, due to the fact that it is MPT based.
When I say MPT, I do not mean MPT(R), I mean MPT as
in technology, not as in trademark.
