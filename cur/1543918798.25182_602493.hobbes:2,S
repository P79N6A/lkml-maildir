ANSI:
\e[31m R--
\e[32m G--
\e[33m RG- (yellow)
\e[34m --B
\e[35m R-B (magenta)
\e[36m -GB (cyan)
\e[37m RGB (white)
ASCII:
1 --B blue
2 -G- green
3 -GB cyan
4 R-- red
...
e.g. just the other way around. 0x17 is gray-on-blue, what I use,
so it's ASCII actually. Quite confusing, yes. :-/

yes, should reword that.

Since I do not use 512-glyph fonts, I do not know.
I suppose no, since that is what is written in the manpages or so.
With FB where the hardware draws the font, I do not know either,
I suppose yes.
With FB where the software draws the font (read: fbiterm with CJK),
it worked as usual, last time I tested.
