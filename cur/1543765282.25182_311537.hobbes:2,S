Subject: TESTING: new git commits mail
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I've set up a script to replace the old one which mailed commits to the
bk-commits-head mailing list. It's fed from Linus' "kernel-test.git"
repository, which isn't necessarily going to end up going into the real
2.6.12 release -- but in the absence of other information or indeed any
tree which definitely _is_ leading to the next release, we might as well
see these commits.
I've stopped setting the Date: header of the mail to match the timestamp
of the commit. That's partly because the current version of git doesn't
actually _include_ the full timestamp information properly, but mostly
because some people were requesting that I do that for the old bkexport
script anyway.
