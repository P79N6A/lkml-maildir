HI all,
I have one compaq server with 4 Intel(R) Xeon cpu's (3.1GHZ), 4GB RAM.
OS:- Fedora Core 2
Kernel:- 2.6.14
when i compile a new kernel, during th compilation process load goes
very high (10 and little above). i can not understand why does this
happen, while if i compile the same kernel on my P4 machine with 1GB ram
and 3GHZ, it remains under 3.
can somebody tell me what is wrong?
