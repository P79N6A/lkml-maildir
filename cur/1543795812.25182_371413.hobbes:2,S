Nobody is talking about taking it away. But it's becomming
more and more useless because there are many situations
where it does unexpected things.
(it's not synchronized over CPUs,
on modern Intel CPUs it always measures the fastest P state even
though you might be running slower, on other CPUs when
you want to measure time it actually changes with P states etc.etc.) 
The performance counter has a much clearer defintion - it's always
cycles are executed by the CPU and it doesn't even pretend
to be a usable timer.

Actually it's wrong - at least on Intel CPUs RDPMC is faster
than RDTSC because it doesn't synchronize.

You tested on a very limited set of platforms and setups then.
So far you were either lucky or just didn't notice the problems yet.
About the only reasonable usage was for custom hacks to measure
cycles, but with all the ongoing changes in its definition
I believe these users will be happier with rdpmc 0 once
it's enabled (and oprofile and other users be taught 
to keep their fingers away) 
People who use it for timing, not measurement, directly are just wrong and 
misguided.
