The ucXXX variables should probably go (or at least be unexported) but I
would keep the _prep_type export for now, unless we are certain no
driver and no out of tree stuff neither uses it (hrm... might well be
the case).
In any case, the proper fix is probably to move the EXPORT_SYMBOL() out
of ppc_ksyms, and have it next to the declaration of the variable.
