Thats extremely slow for a file system.

The one well known example of a database as file system (or was well
known) was the Pick OS (now defunct although the database system lives
on). They did manage to build an OS which had a database as a file
system.
The thing is a database and a file system are the same thing anyway.
You'll find the same structures like B trees used in some for example.
They are just optimised for different kinds of queries. If you want to
know whether a db as fs works , build a prototype and see - you've
already taken the first step and with FUSE you can prototype the rest in
user space.
