What makes the difference isnt just the format of markup (although i 
fully agree that the least visually intrusive markup format should be 
used for static markers, and the range of possibilities includes 
comment-based markers too), but what makes the differen is:
 the /guarantee/ of a full (comprehensive) set to /static tracers/
The moment we allow a static tracer into the upstream kernel, we make 
that guarantee, implicitly and explicitly. (I've expanded on this line 
of argument in the previous few mails, extensively.)
