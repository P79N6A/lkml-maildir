Now that I think about this for 30 more seconds -
this is not a good idea as kernel patch, since it
will break old programs.
So we need a struct hd_geometry2 and an ioctl HDIO_GETGEO2
that returns such a structure.
Nevertheless, you (David Hamm) can try and apply this,
recompile cfdisk, say, and LILO, if you use that,
and report on whether this solves the problems.
