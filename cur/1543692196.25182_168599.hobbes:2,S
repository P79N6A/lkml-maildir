Does VMware roll these changes back in? This isn't cheap software, I
feel they should care for Linux users a bit more.
For those who run VMware on notebooks with ACPI, another patch is
necessary, otherwise ACPI C-states handling doesn't notice VMware and as
a result the guest system is unbearably slow.
