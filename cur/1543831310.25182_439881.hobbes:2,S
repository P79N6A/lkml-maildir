Understood. Thanks for the explanation. Checked Matthieu's log, and yes
it does look like early interrupt. Matthieu's Sil680 has no such problem.
Also the problem is not reproducible with the same CD-RW drive on my
Promise 20275 chip. So, the explanation makes sense.
BTW, even for VIA, the early irq problem occur on 'set features - xfer mode'
but IDENTIFY works ok. Just curious, does the ALi chip have the same
symptom? i.e. Besides the 'set features' command, are there any other
commands affected by the early irq problem? Say, any other PIO non-data
commands?
