Not sure if this is wise. Reclaimed pages should definitely be cache
cold. Other freeing is assumed cache hot and LRU ordered on the hot
list which seems right... but I think you want the cold list for page
reclaim, don't you?

Could the API be made nicer by clearing the page for you if it didn't
find a PG_zero page?

I have the feeling that it might not be worthwhile doing zero on idle.
You've got chance of blowing the cache on zeroing pages that won't be
used for a while. If you do uncached writes then you've changed the
problem to memory bandwidth (I guess doesn't matter much on UP).
It seems like a good idea to do zero pages in the page allocator if
at all (rather than slab), but I guess you don't want to complicate
it unless it shows improvements in macro benchmarks.
Sorry my feedback isn't much, it is not based on previous experience.
