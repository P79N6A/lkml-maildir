Actually, 2K is a more accurate number -- ignore DEBUG_FS.

No; the amount of space shaved from a typical (32-bit banks)
gpio_chip is *exactly* the cost of one gpio_desc:  two words.
In one case, two bitmaps.  In the other, a pointer, two bits,
and internal struct padding.
So unless each bank has only a single GPIO, this approach
does cost more memory.  Both for the extra memory associated
with each gpio_chip that's used, and for unused gpio_desc.
That's not necessarily a bad thing, though it's always worth
avoiding bloat.
