Exactly!
From my notes of long ago, Spurious Interrupts occur when:
-  Interrupt pin is asserted in level sensitive mode, and the asserted
   level is negated before the interrupt is acknowledged.
-  Interrupt pin is asserted for an interrupt source that is later
   masked using the mask bit in the vector/priority register before
   the interrupt is acknowledged.
-  Some UARTs can generate spurious interrupts if you clear the IER
   (Interrupt Enable Register) right before an interrupt occurs.
   Same result, interrupt generated but not present during the
   acknowledge cycle.
-  There are more, but you get the idea.
This appears to be an desired behavior.  I remember that the OpenPIC
interrupt controller (AMD/CYRIX SMP response to the APIC) has the same
(non?) feature...
