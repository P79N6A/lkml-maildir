This is an obnoxious thing to do unless you specifically prove otherwise. You 
cannot take a mutex (and possibly sleep) while holding a spinlock.
You must have either:
+	spin_unlock(&line->count_lock);
+	mutex_lock(&line->open_mutex);
or take count_lock inside open_mutex (which looks like being correct here).
In the first solution, you can create a OPENING flag (via a state variable), 
and add the rule that (unlike the count) nobody but the original setter is 
allowed to change it, and that who finds it set (say a concurrent open) must 
return without touching it.
The state diagram is like:
CLOSED -> OPENING -> OPEN
(only the function which triggered the transition from CLOSED to OPENING can 
trigger the transition from OPENING to OPEN). It can probably be simplified 
to OPENING <-> ! OPENING.
