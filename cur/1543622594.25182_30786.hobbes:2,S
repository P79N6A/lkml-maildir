A shorter example would have sufficed...

Making lost+found world-writable is a terrible idea (even world readable
is bad) because it exposes potentially sensitive files to the world if
it happens that fsck moves a file there after some filesystem problem.
It may be that the sensitive file was in a secure directory, and now it
is world readable.
I would stronly suggest using some other directory for this purpose,
since if you are changing lost+found to be world writable, you could
just as easily do "mkdir .undelete".
Cheers, Andreas
