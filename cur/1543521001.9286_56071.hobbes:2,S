You are talking about RISC architectures. On i386 "incl" instruction
is atomic and is protected by memory lock even on UP machines. In
this case move up/down in the instruction stream is important.
AFAIK this was problem with gcc-2.7.x and objects defined volatile
on i386 family. I will not be surprised if newer gcc is ok.
Anyway this don't hurt.
