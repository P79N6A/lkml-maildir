The performance increase is pretty small. Using an old external dirve
I had lying around I got:
diff -y stock/10k modified/10k
10240+0 records in                                            | 1024+0
records in
10240+0 records out                                           | 1024+0
records out
5242880 bytes transferred in 18.280922 seconds (286795 bytes/ | 524288
bytes transferred in 1.824985 seconds (287283 bytes/se
diff -y stock/1k modified/1k
1024+0 records in                                               1024+0

524288 bytes transferred in 1.777250 seconds (295000 bytes/se | 524288
bytes transferred in 1.764748 seconds (297089 bytes/se
The usual disclaimer of any benchmarking applies, YMMV.
Cheers,
