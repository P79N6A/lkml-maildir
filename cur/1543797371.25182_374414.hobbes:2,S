Maybe the meaning of these numbers varies? I know that 10 is a local 
access but the assumption in include/linux/numa.h that 20 is a remote 
access is probably already a guess.
I know that our Altix machines seem to use 10 for a local and 20 for 
nonlocal but same box. The distances then increase from there.
