Yes, I saw it more like:

Now Dave and I were just talking about actually using the
init process in a pspace to do administration from outside.
For instance, the userspace code, in /sbin/pspaceinit, which
runs as (pspace 2, pid 1), could open a pipe with it's parent
(pspace1, pid 234).  pid 234 can then ask the init process to
do things like list processes, kill a process, and maybe even
recursively talk to the init process in pspace 3.
