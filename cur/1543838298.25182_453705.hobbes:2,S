In progress ! I built-in LVM driver and compile the kernel with the 
-initrd option. I have not more the kernel panic message, but I have a 
lot of errors than this :
I/O error ; hda: cannot handle device with more than 16 heads - giving up
I'm astonished, I believed that old .config was operational with a new 
kernel (my old was a 2.6.16, the new, 2.6.17).
Regards,
Thibaud.
