No, it's in code peculiar to SLUB.
Of course, there might be a similar bug somewhere in SLAB.
More likely to be something else though.

It would help everybody if you could get more info on this.
Give 2.6.24-rc2 a try when it appears, if you can.
Do you think it's the SLAB which is growing?  If /proc/meminfo's
Slab count goes up and up, then use /proc/slabinfo to see what
it is that's leaking.  Then there's CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB_LEAK.
With 2.6.22 or 2.6.23 you could CONFIG_SLUB instead, apply
the leak fix from this thread, and see if SLUB behaves the same
(using Documentation/vm/slabinfo.c instead of /proc/slabinfo); but
chances are the problem's above it, and it will behave the same.
Best start a new thread when you can report back.
Thanks,
Hugh
