Subject: [PATCH 0 of 18] [RFC] ipath - almost-final round of patches for submission
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

This is another round of ipath driver patches for review.  I believe
the driver is almost ready for submission.  We have addressed all prior
feedback that I am aware of.
Major changes since the last round of review comments:
  - Layered drivers now do the right thing when the underlying devices
    get hotplugged.
  - The memory leak that Linus, Hugh, and others have been so helpful with
    during the past week is fixed; we now use remap_pfn_range instead of a
    nopage handler.
  - There are no longer any binary or multiple-valued files in sysfs.
    Instead, we've added an ipathfs filesystem for that stuff.
There are two things left to do:
  - ipath_rc.c contains some enormous functions that we are in the
    process of breaking up into more digestible chunks.
  - The ipathfs filesystem doesn't handle hotplugged devices.
If you have any comments or suggestions, please let me know.  If the
current code looks OK, I expect to make a final submission for 2.6.17
in a day or two, once we have the above two items completed.
