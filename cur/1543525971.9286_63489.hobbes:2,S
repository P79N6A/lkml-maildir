Hmm..... reminiscing....
I remember a time back with my old 386 running DOS 5.0, I had a similar
problem.  HD corrupted... don't know why.  But my nice 44mb HD said it had
like 300mb free, and the filenames were completely unreadable.  Doesn't
really help you at all, I just thought I might share that pointless little
story.  :)
I dunno, maybe you'll have fun reading it or something.
