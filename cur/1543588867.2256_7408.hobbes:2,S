With the __builtin_expect patch junio@siamese.dhis.twinsun.com posted, both
2.4.4-pre6 and 2.4.3-ac12 compile with egcs-2.91.66.  Also, 2.4.3-ac13 builds
without any further patches needed.

2.4.4pre6 only builds with gcc 2.96. If you apply the __builtin_expect fixes
it builds and runs fine with 2.95. Not tried egcs. The gcc 3.0 asm constraints
one I've yet to see a fix for.
