The code seems sane at first view. The private lock inside pl2303
saves you from the most obvious races.

Next, it would be nice to test if PPP works, and if getty and shell work
(with getty driving the USB-to-serial adapter).

I think you just inherited a mistake in usb-serial design. It attempts
to act as an adaptation layer (like, say, USB core itself) instead of
a library like libata. Why can't the UART framework call pl2303?
Also this meaningless obfuscation has to go:
