I don't think you can say that. If the 50% task alternated between
long periods of running and sleeping, then the end result should
approach a task that is sleeping for 50% of the time, and on the
CPU 25% of the time. As the periods get shorter, then the schedulers
will favour the 50% task relatively more, but details will depend on
implementation.
You could have an implementation that always gives runs the 50% task
when it becomes runnable, because it is decided that its priority is
higher because it has been sleeping.
The only thing you can really say is that the 50% task should get
between 25% and 50% (inclusive) CPU time.
