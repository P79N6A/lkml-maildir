[1.] One line summary of the problem:
ncr53c8xx SCSI driver locks up computer after timeout message
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
I have a TekRam DC390/UW2 80MB/Sec SCSI card which uses the ncr53c8xx driver
and a Seagate ST39173LW  drive.
As the README for the ncr53c8xx suggests, I have configured the drive with:
  - only asynchronous data transfers
  - tagged commands disabled
  - disconnections not allowed
Thus, I am not using any advanced features that might be buggy.
Every once and a while, I get something like the following in my log files:
Feb 22 19:43:24 atheist kernel: ncr53c895-0:0: ERROR (0:4) (8-0-0) (f/9f) @(script 6c:1e000000).

Feb 22 19:43:27 atheist kernel: ncr53c895-0-<0,*>: FAST-40 WIDE SCSI 80.0 MB/s (25 ns, offset 15)
And, immediately folowing that, the machine locks up completely, and I need
to reset it.
I don't understand why it is receiving an unexpected disconnect.  I have
disconnections not allowed.
