If you do not need gcc-2.95 support, you can use anonymous unions:
+	union {
+		struct pipe_inode_info	*i_pipe;
+		struct block_device	*i_bdev;
+		struct char_device	*i_cdev;
+	};
so you don't even have to change the accesses. Zero cost optimization patch.
I have tested on gcc-3.0, 3.2.2, RH gcc-2.96-98, and 2.95.2. Only 2.95.2
fails.
I do not know the compiler requirements for 2.5, or if there is any agreement
in kernel developement for not doing this. If this is the case, sorry for
the noise.
