Anything can cause problems. And taking stuff out of context as well is
just silly. I listed the kernels to test and what each patch implies. 
2.3.18ac4 has been confirmed ok by testers so far. That means its not
kupdated as it happens. 
I don't believe you are infallible. I don't believe kupdated is broken. I
do believe in sensible progressive debugging. And if 2.3.18ac2 worked and
ac4 didnt then I'd assume kupdated - regardless of whether it looks right.

I don't. All the reporters seemed to think it started during 2.3.18ac*
2.3.18ac6 adds the following stuff relevant to the VFS
o       Fix filemap_nopage loops under low mem  (Chuck Lever)
2.3.18ac6 adds the following stuff relevant to the VFS
o       Fix filemap_nopage loops under low mem  (Chuck Lever)
o	Remove some more bmap cruft       	(Lennert Buytenhek)
o	i386 tlb handling fix             	(Andrea Arcangeli)
o	Remove some more bmap cruft       	(Lennert Buytenhek)
My guess is that 2.3.18ac5 will also be solid for people and 2.3.18ac6
will be the one that breaks it.
