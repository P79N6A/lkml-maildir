Subject: [patch 14/33] Fix errors in tcp_memcalculations.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: John Heffner <jheffner@psc.edu>
In 2.6.18 a change was made to the tcp_mem[] calculations,
but this causes regressions for some folks up to 2.6.20
The following fix to smooth out the calculation from the
pending 2.6.21 tree by John Heffner fixes the problem for
these folks.
[TCP]: Fix tcp_mem[] initialization.
Change tcp_mem initialization function.  The fraction of total memory
is now a continuous function of memory size, and independent of page
size.
