But instead of continuing this stupid thread, I recommend a more
general approach to the "naming-of-linux" problem.
How about we all choose a favorite linux-hero (*), and name Linux
after that person? The rule is that a linux-distribution CD (like Red
Hat or SuSE) should contain code from that person.
From now on I'll be using REW/Linux, AC/Linux and DSM/Linux. 
Personally I'll refrain from using RMS/Linux and GNU/Linux from now
on, just because RMS has pushed the issue too far.

(*) Feel free to choose "yourself" if you've contributed kernel code or
an application.
