Subject: [UPDATE] LTT patch for 2.5.15
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Following Roman's recommendations, I've updated the LTT patch
with the following changes:
- Modified code format to match Linux coding style
- Removed overweight comments
- Changed trace macros to static inlines
- Converted uint8_t, uint32_t and uint64_t to u8, u32 and u64
- Added <asm/trace.h> for architecture-dependent definitions
I've divided the patch in 4 parts:
1- Core tracing functionality
2- Trace driver
3- Architecture-dependent trace statements (i386, ppc, mips, s/390, sh)
4- Architecture-independent trace statements
Part X is available from:
ftp://ftp.opersys.com/pub/LTT/ExtraPatches/patch-ltt-linux-2.5.15-vanilla-020510-1.14-part-X.gz
The patch is also available in one piece:

Cheers,
Karim
