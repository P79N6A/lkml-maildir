Ok, yes, I'd forgotten we were chaining in the final sha_transform. I
plead too many bufs and buf+5s, which I fix up in 6/6. Funny thing is
that I'd convinced myself that this attack didn't work (correct) last
year when I read the paper I mentioned earlier. But yesterday and
today I couldn't spot the problem with it. So again, I'll add an
explicit comment for future hackers and researchers.
