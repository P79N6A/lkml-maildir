The style as I have understood it is that each .h file in include/linux/
are supposed to be self-contained. So it includes what is needs, and the
'what it needs' are kept small.
Keeping the 'what it needs' part small is a challenge resulting in
smaller .h files. But also a good way to keep related things together.
