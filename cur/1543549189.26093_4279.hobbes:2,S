Hello,
I end up getting this error when I make bzImage:
drivers/char/char.o(.text.lock+0x66a): relocation truncated to fit:
R_386_PC32 text.exit
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
I've upgraded to modutils-2.3.16-1 with Caldera OpenLinux LTP running on
a SuperMicro P6DNF with dual Pentium II Overdrive processors and the
updated BIOS.
I have been able to previously compile 2.4.0-test7-pre4.
Any suggestions?
TIA,
Armand
