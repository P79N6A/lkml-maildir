Do I read that correctly? You are suggesting doing big disruptive 
changes every week? I know what you mean, but this is just what many 
people don't want, being told that they have to give up cyrptoloop or 
devfs to get a better scheduler.

Having been bitten by vendor kernels repeatedly, I would say that some 
are and some aren't. And people who want minor new features like a 
device driver or better scheduler don't want to rebuild a system from a 
base install just to get there. It's one thing to get all the new 
features of a 2.N to 2.{N+2} conversion, but it isn't worth a major 
reconfig to get there.

Do you suggest that many disruptive changes are less expensive than one 
every few years? There should be something between RHEL "stable for five 
years" and FC2 "run up2date on the hour" models. The stable series has 
been that in the past, and dropping any disruptive change into the 
stable series seems to belie the term stable.

So everyman becomes his own vendor, if you want a minor feature you have 
to patch it into an old kernel which still works for you? This is a 
major change from the way stable vs. development has ever worked... It's 
not the pace of little things which troubles me, it's Reiser versions, 
and vanishing cryptoloop and devfs, and things like that which require 
major changes in a system.

No matter how you spin it, you are still talking disruptive change over 
and over vs. an occasional major rethink.

Of course making the end users far more dependent on vendors didn't 
enter into this at all...
