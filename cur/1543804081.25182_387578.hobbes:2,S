The usual use case is that you only need it on disk for your gdb,
but not in RAM. And it now even causes problems like the missing
relocations on PPC64.
[Yes NLKD is not "usual" right now, sorry]
At some point it will change for x86-64 at least when the NLKD unwinder
is ported into the kernel (which I plan to do), but even then it won't
be needed for majority of architectures. Since IA64 likely will need
an exception mechanism for this anyways x86-64 could then later use it too.

The interests of in tree usage normally beats caring for out of tree
patches.
