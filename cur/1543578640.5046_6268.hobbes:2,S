Don't you think cc'ing the man page maintainer [aeb@cwi.nl]
would be a good idea whenever you think something is wrong
in the man pages? You never know, they might even improve.
In this particular case I don't think anything is actually
wrong, but I can well imagine that someone can invent clearer
wording. It would also be useful to more clearly separate
POSIX-mandated behaviour and actual Linux behaviour.
Suggestions and patches are welcome as always.
