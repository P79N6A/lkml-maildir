iSCSI introduces some other issues. The SCSI subsystem has
a 4 byte target (port) identifier at the moment. However Annex A
of the SAM-2 draft ( 
http://www.t10.org
 ) indicates that it should
be 258 bytes for iSCSI (and 11 bytes for ieee1394). For iSCSI the
target port identifier is a WWUI plus a 2 byte target portal group 
tag. A WWUI looks like:
  com.disk-vendor.diskarrays.sn.45678
Also the SCSI subsystem has tended to hide the the initiator's
own identifier (this is usually id 7 on the SCSI parallel bus).
For iSCSI it may be worthwhile to make the initiator port 
identifier visible in driverfs.
There is also the case where you want a box to appear to
the network as an iSCSI target. In this case once a iSCSI
login is complete you might want to represent the initiator
in the driverfs tree. For iSCSI, the initiator port identifier 
is a WWUI plus a 6 byte "inititator session id" for a total
of 262 bytes.
So the "target id" we put in driverfs could have one of
these suggested formats:
   <number>              - 0 to 1 for ATA
   <number>              - 0 to 15 for SCSI parallel interface
   <number>              - 24 bit number for fibre channel
   <EUI 64+discovery_id> - ieee1394
   <???>                 - usb (mass storage + scanner)
   <WWUI> ":" <num>      - iSCSI   [something better than ":"?]
We should also be moving towards 8 byte luns which in one
descriptor format are a 4 level hierarchy (2 bytes at each
level).
