I needed to do highmem anyway (for SUSE kernel)... SMP... I'm not 100%
convinced that SMP support in suspend2 is correct. (Notice: swsusp/SMP
support in current mainline is *not* correct, either). In particular,
if you sleep the CPU, it needs to loop somewhere, right? Can you quote
the piece of code where sleeping CPUs are spinning? ...that one needs
to be in assembly :-(.
Anyway, I believe that refrigerator merge can be done in paralel with
device tree changes, as it will be always very clear what is broken.
