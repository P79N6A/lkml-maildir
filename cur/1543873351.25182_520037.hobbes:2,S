Btw, this is one of those things that easily causes problems.
In many ways it would be nice if we had two different kinds of "bool": one 
where "m" in the dependency chain means "y" is ok, and one where "m" means 
"n".
We used to have "dep_bool" and "dep_mbool" for this, a long time ago. It 
got dropped in the Kconfig language rewrite, and I think it was a mistake.
So I think it would be nice to re-introduce it. As it is, we have a number 
of Kconfig language constructs that are just unnecessarily hard to 
understand, because we end up having to add a "= y" or similar.
The rule *used* to be: "dep_mbool" was a boolean that was valid even for 
modules, while "dep_bool" was a boolean that was valid only for straigth 
"y", and a module would turn it off.
Maybe not "bool" vs "mbool", but it might be nice to have
	bool FB_PS3
		depends strictly on FB
ie a "depends strictly" refuses to upgrade a bool dependency from "m" to 
"y", while a regular depends allows it.
Or something.. The "depends strictly on X" thing would really be just a 
mental shorthand for "depends on (X)=y" (it's actually longer to type, but 
I think it's a bit more intuitive, thus "mental shortcut").
