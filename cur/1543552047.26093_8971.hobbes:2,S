Well, I don't know of such a Mac. To my knowledge, the only Apple box to
have an AGP slot are the ones based on the "Core99" chipset, and they
provide one AGP slot. You won't be lucky with Apple HW anyway as there
are currently issues between the AGP controller and the Linux agpgart
driver preventing from using it. Those issues are tricky and I don't
think a solution will be available soon. (Apple chipset can make the AGP
aperture visible to the CPU AFAIK).
