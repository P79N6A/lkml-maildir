Tomorrow's hardware will have enough buffering as today's hardware has
for simpler tasks. Repeat after me: it likely _wont_ _need_ SCHED_FIFO.
Running tomorrow's hardware on today's boxes indeed pushes the system to
its limits, but torrows hardware will be well-balanced just as much as
today's is - if nothing else then due to kernel drivers providing a
buffering guarantee.
think of SCHED_FIFO on the desktop as an ugly wart, a hammer, that
destroys the careful balance of priorities of SCHED_OTHER tasks. Yes, it
can be useful if you _need_ a scheduling guarantee due to physical
constraints, and it can be useful if the hardware (or the kernel) cannot
buffer enough, but otherwise, it only causes problems.

yeah, i somewhat share that view. (despite all the promises from the
audio folks - if they are just half as agressive resisting removal as
they were pushing integration then it will never be removed ;-)
but i'm not sure how rlimits will contain the whole problem - can
rlimits be restricted to a single app (jackd)? The most canonical use of
rlimits is per-user (per-group), so the rlimit could end up _widening_
the effects of the hack ...

the big difference is that process limits are finegrained and it has a
single value (unlimited) that allows the DoS - while the RT-rlimits have
_one_ value that is safe, all the other values are unsafe!
