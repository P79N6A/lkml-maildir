Hi:
I have write the lines referenced to ad1886 in the patch that Salvador
Eduardo Tropea indicate me in next direction:
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0107.0/0389.html
ad1886 is recognized and the code of setup_ad1886 is executed, i have
put a printk in the function and i can see it. 
The problem is that i can't hear any sound :( It's seem to be mute on
thanks
