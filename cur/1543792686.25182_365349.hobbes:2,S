"umount <directory>" _absolutely_ makes sense, whether "directory" is "." 
or something else. People do it all the time.
Now, if it doesn't unmount the last thing mounted on top of ".", then 
that's a misfeature. It might be a misfeature in the mount program (it 
might scan /etc/mounts top-to-bottom rather than the other way), but the 
kernel should also support it.

It's definitely neither unusual nor undefined. I do all my umounts by 
directory (in fact, doing it by anything else really _is_ badly defined, 
since a block device can be mounted in many places), and the only sane 
semantics would be to peel off the last mount on that directory.
Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that "list_add_tail()" is wrong. But 
if we add new mounts to the end, then umount remove them from the end too, 
no?
