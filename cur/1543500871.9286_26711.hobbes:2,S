FWIW, it is pretty much what I have read in www.aceshardware.com.
AFAIK, the UP{1,2}000 and AMD's "reference motherboard" are currently
the only 3 motherboards capable of running K-7.
So I was wondering about specs of the UP{1,2}000 motherobards and 
and their prices. Does anyone know where I can find more info on
them? Trying to search www.digital.com and www.snap.com did not 
return any matches :(
And for reference here's the article from www.aceshardware.com.
Alpha:Slot-A:Slot-B:Athlon KH Yeap Wednesday,
              June 23, 1999 (10:00 AM EST) 
              Ok, at the ongoing PC Expo in New York, Alpha
              Processor Inc. is demo'ing its new
              Alpha-21264 750 Mhz, which is expected to
              come out in July. More interestingly a 1 Ghz
              versions of the processor, which runs under
              regular air-cool condition, is also demo'ed
              along with a Slot-A motherboard, UP1000, and
              a Slot-B motherboard, UP2000. For further
              details check out this News.com report. 
              Now, a lot of people have been wondering
              about the possibility of running a K7 on an
              Alpha Slot-A or Slot-B motherboard. According
              to Alpha, yes, this is possible. To make
              things even more interesting Alpha's new
              Slot-A motherboard, UP1000, uses a chipset
              that is a hybrid between AMD's very own K7
              chipset, Irongate (AMD-751), and ALI's
              M1543C!! PC Watch Japan has a great shot of
              this UP1000 motherboard. Also appears on PC
              Watch is a photo of the Slot-B UP2000 and a
              photo of the 1 Ghz Slot-B Alpha processor.
              Special thanks to Daiki for this wonderful
	      tips.
