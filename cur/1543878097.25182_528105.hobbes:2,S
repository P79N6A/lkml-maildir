Hmm...... Maybe we need to have a separate size for the vmemmap size?

Yes that is far too much.

I have some measurements 1M vs. 16M that I took last year when I first 
developed the approach:
1. 16k vmm page size

4M would be right in the middle and maybe not so bad.
Note that these numbers were based on a more complex TLB handler.
See 
http://marc.info/?l=linux-ia64&m=116069969308257&w=2
 (variable
kernel page size handler).
The problem with a different page size is that this would require 
redesign of the TLB lookup logic. We could go back to my variable kernel 
page size patch quoted above but then we walk the complete page table.
The 1 level lookup as far as I can tell only works well with 16M.
If we would try to use a 1 level lookup for a 4M page then we would have
a linear lookup table that takes up 4MB to support 1 Petabyte.
