It is ATM impossible to make a module that patches sys_call_table safe against
module unload races. The only way is to put a stub into the main kernel
that manages the module counters and calls a separate hook (i.e. as done 
by nfsd's syscall) 
[Introducing quiescent states in module unloading would probably fix that,
as it has been discussed for a long time now, but I lost hope that it'll ever
get implemented in the main kernel]
Other than that on some weird architectures like IA64 it can get quite 
complicated to patch the syscall table.
