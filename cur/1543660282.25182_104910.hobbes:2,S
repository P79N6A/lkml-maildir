You can blame me for the mess with smp_call_function:
2.2 supported nonatomic calls. I have no idea if that was deadlock free.
But noone used the 'retry/nonatomic' parameter, noone handled an error 
return of  smp_call_function (some callers panic).
Thus I've removed these features from i386, without changing the 
prototype. I think all archs have picked that up now.
But retry/nonatomic should not spread into new functions.
