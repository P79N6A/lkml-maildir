Hi,
I've encountered a problem with regard to using IPX and IP aliases at the
same time. 
If the IPX module is loaded, and any IP aliased interfaces are taken down,
the whole interface downed.
My problems can be seen in the attached typescript, I compressed it for
bandwidth reasons.
I'm currently not subscribed to linux-kernel, so please CC me.
