it decreases performance. I've seen this, Con also saw this (well it's better 
than the 'nr_requests = 4' change ;) but mouse stops are still there.

I agree with the last sentence, in theory, but practice showed something 
different (about 10% to 15% performance decrease)
But I am quite sure that this depends on your machine/hardware. Using IDE 
instead of SCSI for example.

It helps but it's not as good as 2.4.18 stock.

I also tried that.

Sure, I did this too. FS independent, where ReiserFS is still the best for 
this scenario with the most few pauses than any other FS (ext2, ext3, ...)
But for desktop usage: not acceptable! No way, No go!

hehe, well wasting RAM for no gain is my next part on my todo ;) (cache 
everything even if there is no RAM for example, well but this is not the 
point in this thread)
