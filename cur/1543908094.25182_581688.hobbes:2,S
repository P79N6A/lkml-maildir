Subject: [PATCH] limit minixfs dir_pages on corrupted dir i_size, CVE-2006-6058
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This attempts to address CVE-2006-6058 
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-6058
first reported at 
http://projects.info-pull.com/mokb/MOKB-17-11-2006.html
Essentially a corrupted minix dir inode reporting a very large
i_size will loop for a very long time in minix_readdir, minix_find_entry,
etc, because on EIO they just move on to try the next page.  This is
under the BKL, printk'ing as well.  This can lock up the machine 
for a very long time.  A simple approach is to at least limit the nr. of 
pages attempted to no more than s_max_size.  (s_max_size is about 256MB for
V1, but 2GB for V2; this could still result in a lot of EIO reads in the V2
case, should the retry loops in minix_readdir & friends be short-circuited
somehow instead?  A simple "break" rather than "continue" on error would 
certainly resolve it, too...)
