Kernel version 2.3.19
To get it to boot, I have to tell it 'mem=64M' or else it freaks out.
Relevant boot messages:
Loaded 7878 symbols from /boot/System.map-2.3.19.
Symbols match kernel version 2.3.19.
No module symbols loaded.
Linux version 2.3.19 (root@lucretia.wmis.net) (gcc version 2.7.2.3) #1 Tue Oct 5

IV bug.
Intel Pentium with F0 0F bug - workaround enabled.
PCI: PCI BIOS revision 2.00 entry at 0xe8200
PCI: Probing PCI hardware
PCI: Ignoring ghost devices on bus 0
PCI: Address space collision on region 6 of device DEC DC21041
It crashes around there..
If I say 'mem=64M', region 0010000 becomes 64MB like expected.
The machine is a freebie Acer P60 that used to be an expensive server but now
is just a fairly slow DNS server. Its age is demonstrated by the PCI 2.0 only
specs. I have to force it to use the BIOS routines so it would find PCI
devices.
