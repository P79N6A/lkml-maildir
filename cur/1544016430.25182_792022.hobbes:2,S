Subject: [PATCH RFC] Use kernel/Kconfig.preempt for ARM
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/14/263

before this patch ARM had it's own definition of CONFIG_PREEMPT.
Instead of that use the general definition provided in
kernel/Kconfig.preempt.
It adds some dependencies such that the available options don't change
(neither for ARM nor for other archs).  The only resulting changes are
that ARM gets CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE and the help text.
Currently the only usage of CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE is in
kernel/trace/trace.c and only affects the content of some proc files
where "M:unknown" is changed to "M:server" if it is defined.
The intention is that ARM gets the option CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT after it
will be added to kernel/Kconfig.preempt as it is done in the linux-rt
tree.
