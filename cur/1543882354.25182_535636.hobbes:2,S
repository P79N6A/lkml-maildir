That's because there is no other possibility. Sooner or later you have
to do a snapshot, and somehow you have to save it. You're not going to
get a new solution, just one that do those basic things in new and
better ways.
I'm perfectly willing to think through some alternate approach if you
suggest something or prod my thinking in a new direction, but I'm afraid
I just can't see right now how we can achieve what you're after.
