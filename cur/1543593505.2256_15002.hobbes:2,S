Which compiler do you use? The default compiler from 7.0 is known to
produce buggy kernels, and Linus didn't include the kgcc detection.
Could you check that kgcc is used for compiling?
Just replace '$(CROSS_COMPILE)gcc' in /usr/src/linux/Makefile with
'$(CROSS_COMPILE)kgcc'
Or upgrade to the gcc compiler from 7.1?
