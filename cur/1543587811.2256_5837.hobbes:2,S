The idea behind that was that, if it is a seperate module, then it would be easier to maintain for
me. I am a guy that always needs the newest and greatest, so I expected that I would have to port my
stuff to newer kernels frequently. (I started the HPT-RAID0 alone without much knowledge about the
kernel.)

I could not use the disk striping, because of the raid0 code is not capable of processing a request
what would span more than one disk. You also have to shift the offset of all but the first disk by
10 sectors. So I created an own personality...
I also guess it would be a bit complicated if we want to create a raid10. Is this done by putting a
raid1 over raid0 devices? We would have to find a way to map the sectors according to the IDE-RAID
spec of the controller over several raid levels.
An ataraid personality would be easier and more flexible then.
