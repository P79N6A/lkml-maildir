What actually happens is that any non-recognized value is assumed to be 'n'.
So if 'yes' is recognised, then fine.
And with the simple parser used today "CONFIG_FOO=yes" would be recognised
as yes, because it checks only the 'y'.
I did not look that close on the patch you sent, but I think they
have the same functionality.
If this wasn't after feature freeze I would have liked to see the
hidden .config file to be replaced by for example Kconfigdata or
similar.
So many times I have seen people being asked to backup there
configuration, which is located in a hidden file.
If people should keep their fingers away from it - then we should note
that in the top of the file. As we do in the rest of the kernel.
And then we could have invented a better syntax, that was not
dictated by bash or similar.
Something to propose in the 2.7 timeframe.
