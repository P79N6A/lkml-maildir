Honestly, I have 3 purposes, 2 for readability/clarificaton and 1 for my trial.
1. Clarify page cache <-> inode relationship before *new concept of page cache*,
   yours or someone else's is introduced.
2. There are some places using PAGE_MAPPING_ANON directly. I don't want to see
   following line in .c file. 
   ==
   anon_vma = (struct anon_vma *)(mapping - PAGE_MAPPING_ANON);
   ==
3. I want to *try* page->mapping overriding... store  memory resource controller's   
   information in page->mapping. By this, memory controller doesn't enlarge sizeof
   struct page. (works well in my small test.)
   Before doing that, I have to hide page->mapping from direct access.

This is my first experience of using bool in Linux kernel.. :)
I know bool is not very widely used in Linux now but I tried it because 
this function obviously returns yes or no, and C language supports bool as
_Bool now. If messy, I'll avoid using this in this time..

For clarify meaning of compareing page_mapping_cache() with mapping.
Does this reduce readability ?
Thank you for comments.
