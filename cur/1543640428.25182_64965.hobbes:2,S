Shouldn't it be moved to userpace, instead? Pulling a small amount
of entropy from /dev/random can be done in userspace, too. And the
application could choose *how often* and *how many* bits to pull.
The kernel can only make a choice which may be too much for an application
(making it drain more entropy than it needs) or too little for another
(forcing it to use /dev/random directly). Let the kernel implement
the Real Thing only (/dev/random). /dev/urandom really belongs to
userspace.
