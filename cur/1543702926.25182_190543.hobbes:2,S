Found some errors in my earlier reply. I've added additional
comments below.
I've not quoted the long style cleanup patch in this reply as I trust you
can find it in the previous mail in the thread.
I've also not quoted the bits where I have no corrections - please see the
previous email for those.

In the above patch 'unsigned long bytes;' should ofcourse have been
'int bytes' - I should have read the patch more closely after
running diff on my own tree.
As I've been unable to find any scenario where an int can actually
overflow there is ofcourse no need to change the type - my bad.

After creating the initial cleanup patch I've noticed several more
instances of this 'bad style'. If there's any interrest in cleaning them
up I'll be happy to create a patch.  Is this wanted?
