IRQ threads are configurable.  If you don't want them, you CAN turn them
off (if you have already turned them on). 
You don't HAVE to turn them on. 
The IRQ option option adds "responsiveness" to the not forgotten, but
configurable, "progress, throughput, fairness, resource sharing"
principles of Unix found in the Linux kernel.
A lot of the IRQ stuff is already in bottom halves, where it runs in a
thread sometimes. But when it doesn't, its not preemptable, sometimes
for a long time. Add other non-preemptable regions, and you get big
aggregates. 
The IRQ thread option runs SoftIRQd in a thread always, if you want to
configure it that way, and eliminates the IRQ latency burstyness.
As far as the hard IRQs, you can leave them off too, and maybe turn on 
one for a while, until you forget that you did that. 
Then try another.
Your other questions are probably covered by Ingo's current remarks.
Cheers,
Sven
