There were two releases 3.2N and 3.3A which never got into the
Linux kernel. I did submit 3.3A, but it got dropped.
The important changes from 3.3M to 3.3A are use of the "new" SCSI
error handling, improved locking (use a driver lock instead of
io_request_lock), and adding support for the new U3W adapter. 3.3A
can be gotten from:
http://www.connectcom.net/support/software/os/linux.htm
I tested this version on a number of UP and DP systems in v2.3.9X
kernels. I had some problems with (I think) the new SCSI error
handling so I didn't submit it at the time.
There is also a 3.3B in which Jerry Quinn <jlquinn@us.ibm.com>
added PowerPC support (in addition to x86 and alpha). I will check
with Jerry to get the latest version, test it in the lastest kernel,
and if the error handling problems are gone submit it.
Please send any follow-up to linux-scsi; I only read the kernel traffic
summaries of linux-kernel.
