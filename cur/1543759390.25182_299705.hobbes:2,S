Not sure, if one bit goes wrong you put everything in the wrong places
:-). Linklist seems just okay to me, no > 4K allocations. I'm not sure
why recalculation is that big problem.

Well, more interesting was that you actually freed much more memory
with your patch. *You actually made memory freeing to work*. So yes, I
like that one.
