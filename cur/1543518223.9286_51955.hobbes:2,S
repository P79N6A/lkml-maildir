Hello
For a couple of week I'm having this problem:
I've tried to use SMP kernel with nosmp option for kernel image.
And I have found out strange problem.
After a discussions with AC and testing few more cases
these are results.
Could anyone test this and confirm that its not just mine
computer?
Se here are the results:
Computer is 2x400 (450) Celer BP6 128MB G400 HD20GB
I'm using /usr & /home partition mounted over network
from another computer.
This machine also exports its directories (using knfs).
Everything works without almost any problems while normaly using SMP.
(I think once this computer locked when there was huge disk activity
on the nfs server)
However when I pass 'nosmp' parameter I'm getting into two states:
One of them is this:

Nov 30 16:54:19 dual kernel: nfs: task 417 can't get a request
slot             
In this state I could use Magic key to remount drives RO and safely
reboot.
The second version is not so nice - as I'm getting messages about 
hda: interrupt losts
In both cases there is nothing wrong when I stay in init mode 1.
In this mode when I print /proc/interrupts there are no conflicts on
irq.
As soon as I start nfs services this bug appears.
I have tried two other cards - EEpro100 and a different 3c59x card
(Bummerang).
I suspect probably some bug in nfs code, but I'm not sure about this.
Also I have tried many kernels - 2.2.13....2.2.14pre11 and also
2.2.30pre3
and all of them have the same problem on my computer.
When I've tried to run 2.2.13 with idk and nosmp I could not boot at
all.
Doesn't anyone have any ideas where could be the problem?
