Hmm, I'm still seeing jerky swap out performance with make -j 30 on 256MB
workstation.  Swap in is good and smooth though.  I would see kswapd taking
about 10% (with 30 gcc processes on a 2x366 celeron) just before it would
swap out about 5000 blocks in one second (actually, the entire system
stalled for about 5-10 seconds, and vmstat wouldn't even report in that
time period).
Rik,
Would you be interested in a vmstat output from kernel compile that is
guaranteed to generate swap out?
I thought of sending both output of make and vmstat to syslog (to get
timestamps and an idea of exactly what is happening during the vmstat
output...).
If so, I can write up a little script that can send the output of vmstat, a
diff of /proc/meminfo, and make output from kernel compile.
Or would that be too much data to look at?

No, the ext3 guys are working on a merge patch for -ac right now.  Though
you won't see it on the ext3 for 2.4 web site...  Check the ext2-devel
archive for the last week or so...
