It definitely is an RV370, you're right in that. I'm too lazy to actually 
see if the other entries that claim to be RV350's really are RV350's.
So I decided to just remove it. Even if there is some other bug that could 
make it work again, we can always just re-add it at that time. In the 
meantime, this should fix both DaveJs and Mauros problems, and is clearly 
no worse than 2.6.15 (which also didn't recognize the card), so...
