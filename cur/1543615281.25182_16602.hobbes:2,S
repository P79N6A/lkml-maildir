Hi Tom,
Can you have a look at Doug Ledford's 0.13 driver? this incorporates 
most or all of the fixes you mentioned, except for SiS support, and some 
other fixes; it hasn't been incorporated into the main kernel quite yet 
because it needs more testing.
it's located at 
http://people.redhat.com/dledford/i810_audio.c.gz
i've put a lot of work into this driver and i'd like to see everyone 
working on i810 code continue to work off a single base of source code 
rather than ending up with yet another fork...
thanx,
Nathan Bryant
