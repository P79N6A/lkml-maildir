Cisco has provided considerable resources to the Linux community here in
the Silicon Valley. They are OK in my book. The fact is that I am working
with someone that has an investment in Cisco's products and are
considering a potential initial rollout of a score of rather
high-performance SMP linux systems and they would like to take advantage
of the capabilities that their Cisco equipment offers. I don't blame them.
On one hand, operability with their existing Cisco infrastructure may
influence their decision to use Linux. On the other hand, the
cost/performance of Linux might influence their thinking about staying
with a Cisco infrastructure.
My gut feeling is that the sooner Cisco can get Linux working completely
with EtherChannel the better for both Linux and Cisco.
