So you could actually code around that. If you have them virtually contiguous
for mmap for example then you can actually mmap arbitary page arrays

Im not the one to call the shots, but it seems if you need an AVL for the
vmalloc tables then vmalloc is possibly being overused, or people are not
allocating buffers just occasionally as anticipated
