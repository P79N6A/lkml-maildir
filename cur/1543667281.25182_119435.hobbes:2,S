These aren't terribly informative without profiles (esp. cache perfctrs).
TCP to localhost was explained to me as some excess checksumming that
will eventually get removed before 2.6.0.
It's unclear why open()/close()/stat()/unlink() should be any different.
fork() is just rmap stuff. Try 2.5.65-mm2 and 2.5.65-mm3.
