Well, not everybody is interested in all code (but only in some
interesting fragment) so one knows that part. Others do need a full
overview over complete sources - these simply know the sources like
their spoken language's vocabulary. See - it's not looking at sources
for some weeks. It's looking at them for five or ten years.

ctags may help, as well as LXR (to grovide a hint for non-expert
googlers: 
http://lxr.linux.no/
 ).
