That's the same thing we like about it on ppc64 partitions.

You can free up individual pages back to the hypervisor, but you might
also want the opportunity to free up some unused mem_map if you shrink
the partition by a large amount.

You can either pull them from here:
	
http://www.sr71.net/patches/2.6.11/2.6.11-rc3-mhp1/broken-out/
or grab the whole tarball:
http://www.sr71.net/patches/2.6.11/2.6.11-rc3-mhp1/broken-out-2.6.11-rc3-mhp1.tar.gz
Or, I could always post the whole bunch to lhms.  Nobody there should
mind too much. :)
The largest part of porting hot-add to a new architecture is usually the
sparsemem portion.  You'll pretty much have to #ifdef pfn_to_page() and
friends, declare a few macros, and then do a bit of debugging.  Here's
ppc64 as an example:
