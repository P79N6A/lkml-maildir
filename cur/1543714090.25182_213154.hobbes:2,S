POSIX is seriously broken here. It is terrible to have a system
where "cd .." does not go to the directory that is listed by "ls ..".
Thus, one should always set -o physical.
(We should have had a command "cd.." to go back to where we came from,
distinct from "cd ..".)
But also bash is broken and violates POSIX:
% pwd
/foo
% mkdir abc
% cd abc
% pwd
/foo/abc
% mv ../abc ../qqq
% /bin/pwd
/foo/qqq
% pwd
/foo/abc
% pwd -L
/foo/abc
% pwd -P
%
We see two bugs: "pwd -P" gives no output at all, and "pwd"
gives the wrong output.
POSIX says:
       -L     If the PWD environment variable contains  an  abso-
              lute  pathname  of  the current directory that does
              not contain the filenames dot or dot-dot, pwd shall
              write  this pathname to standard output. Otherwise,
              the -L option shall behave as the -P option.
So, in the situation where PWD contains /foo/abc but that is
not an absolute pathname of the current directory, the output
must be /foo/qqq and not $PWD.
