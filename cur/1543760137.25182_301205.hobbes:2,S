Ok, I now saw that you call call_usermodehelper with wait==1. Why is that
necessary? If you don't wait there, you don't need any hacks around the
console semaphore, because the helper will simply wait for change_console
to finish.

Right. I don't think that sysfs is the right interface for this problem.
For a short moment I had the idea that you could write an escape sequence
to the tty device, but that would race against the regular output.
An ioctl on the tty device is probably the best you can do here, but
if that's not possible, creating a misc device in order to do ioctl on it
is a rather ugly hack.
