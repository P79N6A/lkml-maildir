While I had looked at RFC 2131, I wanted to check it again before answering
Alexey, but I was wondering about getting my own broadcast ARP packet back.

I wanted to  look at the code  some more first, but  regardless of switches,
when I broadcast  a packet, I also  receive the packet at the  same time and
yet my code  doesnt't get triggered, so I'm  not quite sure if it  will if I
receive a duplicate of my packet later.
I hope to have the time to look at it tonight.
Either way, it's  indeed easy to add an additional  check to discard packets
that come from my MAC address.

No,  but that'd  be confusing  and  it can  easily be  avoided. So, if  it's
needed, I'll  add the check  (I'd rather not  add it unless  it's definitely
needed)
