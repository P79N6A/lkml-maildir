yes.  most if not all.

Define "older" :)  Even 2.2 kernels have worked this way for a while, so
it really depends on how far you want to go back.  I think this policy
started in late 2.1.xx days IIRC.
Also, WRT older kernel compatibility, look at drivers/net/acenic.c or
the kcompat24 toolkit.  These, and other code, illustrate how to be
compatible with older kernels without loading the source code down with
ifdefs.  The basic idea is to provide a 2.4-like API on older kernels,
using macros and inline functions hidden in a compatibility header.
