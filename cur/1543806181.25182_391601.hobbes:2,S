It wasnt enabled in any default configs, but i believe its functional
even earlier. Atleast when i changed the method for irq migration via 
/proc, i remember testing on ia64 on ixgb driver. 
I havent followed the register_ops() discussion but believe it just changed
the default vector allocation to arch/platform types. But the core
msi should have worked even earlier.
