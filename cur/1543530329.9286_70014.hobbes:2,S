Bingo.  I think you've hit the nail on the head. It comes down to the
difference between just junping in and doing a "quick hack" that seems
to suit an immediate need, or actually "designing" the change. By
design, I mean considering how the change might impact other peices of
code, etc.

Ouch!  That's a sore spot for me... I have no intention of moving any
production system to 2.3.xx, or even the 2.4 kernel until its been out
for some time.  For that matter, I've still got production systems
running the 2.0.36 kernel, with uptimes of hundreds of days.  If it
ain't broke, don't fix it!
The architectural changes to the drivers that Linus is insisting on mean
that I have to have completely different drivers for 2.0.xx, 2.2.xx or
the later 2.3/2.4 kernels.  That's a problem, because most driver
maintainers are only going to keep the source for the latest kernel up
to date, while many Linux users in the real world may not be upgrading
to 2.4 for a long time to come.  Basically though, if I add a new
network card to a system running those older versions of Linux, or run
into a bug in the drivers I am using, I am left out in the cold, unless
I want to hack the drivers myself, or do a massive upgrade of the
system.
I hate the fact that lately, it seems the attitude of Linux kernel
development has seemed to be "screw the stable kernel tree".  Too many
driver fixes, etc, make it into the 2.3.xx kernel, and not into the
2.2.xx source, I think.  I have yet to see a good solid explanation for
breaking driver compatibility between 2.2 and 2.3.
