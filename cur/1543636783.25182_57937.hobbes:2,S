Hmm.  I don't have an asm directory, in spite of running oldconfig.
I suspect this problem is a result of the previous problem
I reported with "make mrproper" having an error?
I will try creating a completely new tree and then use that 
.config file (make oldconfig dep all install modules modules_install).
