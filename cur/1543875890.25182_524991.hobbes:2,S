Ok, it certainly looks better, but it *also* looks like it just assumes 
the HPET is there. Which would work in testing _with_ a HPET, but would 
likely break on hardware without one, no?
Shouldn't there be at least something like a
	if (!is_hpet_capable())
		return 0;
at the top of that init routine? I'd also expect that you'd need to check 
that "hpet_virt_address" is valid or something?
(Or, better yet, shouldn't we set "boot_hpet_disable" when we decide not 
to use the HPET, and set hpet_virt_address to NULL?)
