Subject: 2.6.16-rc5-mm2 - kzalloc() considered harmful for debugging.

So I've got a (probably self-inflicted) memory leak in slab-64 and slab-32.
Rebuild the kernel with CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB, reboot, and wait for a bit of
leak to pile up, and then echo 'slab-32 0 0 0' > /proc/slabinfo
And ta-DA! the top offender is... (drum roll): <kzalloc+0xe/0x36>
Blargh.  It's tempting to do something like this in include/linux/slab.h:
#ifdef CONFIG_SLAB_DEBUG
static inline void* kzalloc(size_t size, gfp_t flags)
{
        void *ret = kmalloc(size, flags);
        if (ret)
                memset(ret, 0, size);
        return ret;
}
#else
extern void *kzalloc(size_t, gfp_t);
#end
or maybe some ad-crock macro implementation, just so the actual calling site of
kmalloc is recorded, rather than losing the caller of kzalloc.
Only problems are that (a) changing CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB will probably recompile
the world rather than just mm/slab.c, and (b) it's 7AM and I've been chasing this
for 6 hours and not sure how to handle the actual body in mm/util.c (wrap the
kzalloc() with a #ifndev CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB maybe)?
