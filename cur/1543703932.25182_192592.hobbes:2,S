Thanks for the patch.  I realize that defconfig is just ONE
configuration that can be built, but it has been used for a couple years
in automated build regressions.  And, it actually boots on a number of
desktop computers!

I realize that allnoconfig is pathological, but it has caught several
config errors.  One would never try to boot from such a config.  Builds
based on allnoconfig have one purpose and that purpose is to validate
that defines are not used in cases where they are NOT defined in the
configuration.  Developers will quite often code a feature or
architecture with the config parameters always ON.  When the config
option is turned OFF, I will find compile errors, undefined variables,
and the like. This is actually quite a valuable screen.
If developers feel that this has outlived its usefulness, I'll remove it
from the compile regressions.  However, all I have received at this
point have been requests to put an allnoconfig build into the
regressions.
