right ... the testcase posted is more to quickly illustrate the
problem ... the requested size doesnt really matter, what does matter
is that we cant seem to reclaim memory from the VFS cache in scenarios
where the VFS cache is eating a ton of memory and we need some more
another scenario is where an application is constantly reading data
from a cd, re-encoding it to mp3, and then writing it to disk.  the
VFS cache here quickly eats up the available memory.
