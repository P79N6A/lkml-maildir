Not in exp_getclient, but somewhere else. It would require a redo list for
NFS (similar to what IP uses when a socket is locked). Not very complicated.
Also needs a simple timeout mechanism.

I would propose using netlink sockets, because they do already supply a very nice
framework for non blocking pseudo reliable kernel<->user space communication. No
need to reinvent the flat tire.
(2) can be easily done by checking for sk->dead on the kernel netlink socket.

Sounds good.

I thought more like:
1. Check nlsk->dead, if true return NULL
2. Initialize a simple structure with IP address 
3. Use netlink_broadcast to send it to any listening clients.
5. Return -1
(Not waiting because you don't want to block a nfsd thread - otherwise a very simple
DOS would be possible). 
In the nfsd main loop:
If -1 is returned put the complete request on a timeout list (with resource checks)
Before the svc_recv():
Check if anything is in the redo list, if yes process that.
Netlink input callback is called with an IP address in packet:
1. Search it in timeout list.
2. Unqueue the old request from the timeout list.
If the answer is positive:
	Put it into the redo list (with maximum length and tail drop)
Otherwise
	Free request
	Add negative lookup entry (again with strict memory resource limits)
Periodic GC timer:
- Remove all negative client entries that are too old and all old packets in the
timeout list.

Blocking the server thread is not acceptable.  Netlink solves it nicely.

For UDP it is easy, just drop it - the other end just will retransmit. 
For TCP I am not sure. Unfortunately NFS has no EAGAIN.
