I think that stackable filesystem is useless for this. See this:
- I have some BIG (>> 1 TB) filesystem (XFS/ext3/JFS whatever!!!) 
mounted in /BIG
- I call something like snapshot --what=/BIG/data --where=/OTHER_FS/snap1
- from now whenever I delete/create/modify file/dir in /BIG/data then 
BEFORE the action the original file/dir should be copyied/moved to
/OTHER_FS/snap1
There is no place where can I use stackable filesystem because I'd need 
to use it on the very beginning of mounting /BIG so instead:
mount /dev/md0 /BIG -t xfs
I'd need to do something like:
mount /dev/md0 /BIG -t snapfs -o fstype=xfs
Which is something I'm trying to avoid as much as possible for many reasons.

This is also something (but just a bit) different - I don't need "change 
notification" but "pre-change notification" ;)

You're absolutely right but when I'm going to spent several weeks on 
something like this I'd like to do something usefull - not something 
which will be trashed after exam. So I'm trying to find out some 
"politically correct" way.
Right now I'll code it with the very nasty "find sys_call_table" hack 
just I can test it without rebooting my machine (attempts to get 2.6.0 
running under UML or VMWare failed :-((() and when I'll release some 
0.0.1 version and get some good respondce I'll code it as the VFS patch 
& module.
