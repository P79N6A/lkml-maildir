I tried this one out last night and it got the first primary partition
correct but the partitions in the extended partition wouldn't mount. It
complained about a short read. I can run it again and forward the messages
if anyone wants them. I'll try the others tonite.

When they took the Fourth Amendment, I was quiet because I didn't deal drugs.
When they took the Sixth Amendment, I was quiet because I was innocent.
When they took the Second Amendment, I was quiet because I didn't own a gun.
Now they've taken the First Amendment and I can't say anything.
