Suspend.h sounds reasonable. I picked freezer.h because I thought it
made the purpose of the #include simple and crystal clear, and doesn't
pull in other dependencies (my freezer.h depends on nothing else, where
as suspend.h already depends on:
#if defined(CONFIG_X86) || defined(CONFIG_FRV) || defined(CONFIG_PPC32)
#include <asm/suspend.h>
#endif
#include <linux/swap.h>
#include <linux/notifier.h>
#include <linux/init.h>
#include <linux/pm.h>
That said, suspend.h isn't anything like sched.h itself :)
