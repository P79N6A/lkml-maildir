That has problems if you link with a library that requires the lowest
numbered fd semantic.  I'm guessing mod_perl is such a library, if you
have a script which spawns another process.  Sure you can fix the
library, but what happens when you're simply calling code you don't want
to change?
Perhaps a socket option on the listening socket would be better.

One day this will be called "layer 5 routing" and every switch worth
paying for will do it in hardware... :-)
