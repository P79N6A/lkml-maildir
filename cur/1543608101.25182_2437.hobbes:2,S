There are a lot of patches applied to -ac that are not in the main line.
If many of those are applied to 2.4.16+, would they also be put into the
2.5.x line early in the process so that they will be fairly synced, plus
give you ample time to feel comfortable with their stability?
Especially patches that did not come directly from the maintainers.
