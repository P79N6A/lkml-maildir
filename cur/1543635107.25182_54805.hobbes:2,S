Hmm. Haven't received this message. Reading it on LKML.

Well, obviously the construct
switch (iforce->bus)
case CONSTANT:
#ifdef CONSTANT
do stuff
#endif
will not work.
Why is all this #ifdef mess necessary.
Those are recognition constants.
How can you compare iforce->bus to IFORCE_USB or IFORCE_232
if those are only defined sometimes, based on config options...
Why not just...
#if defined(CONFIG_JOYSTICK_IFORCE_232)
#define IFORCE_232      1
#endif
#if defined(CONFIG_JOYSTICK_IFORCE_USB)
#define IFORCE_USB      2
#endif
drop the if statements and always define the constants.
The code will get much simpler IMHO.

Here's what I found in the 2.4 videodev.h:
   /* old, obsolete interface -- dropped in 2.5.x, don't use it */
        int (*open)(struct video_device *, int mode);
        void (*close)(struct video_device *);
...
 /* new interface -- we will use file_operations directly
         * like soundcore does.
         * kernel_ioctl() will be called by video_generic_ioctl.
         * video_generic_ioctl() does the userspace copying of the
         * ioctl arguments */
