This is 'early'.  Keep in mind that this version of KGDB already isn't
breaking in nearly as early as the one in -mm (this version is currently
doing it just before do_basic_setup()).  And keep in mind that the goal
of this version right now is to get something clean and small that can
somehow slip into Linus' tree.  Changes to the non-lite
core/i386/whatever to allow for much earlier access is fine.
