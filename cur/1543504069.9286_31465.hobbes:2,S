Have you seen M$' CRT?
It sometimes worth to see.
Here is a critical piece of their 'strlen' code:
        mov    eax,dword ptr [ecx]     ; read 4 bytes
        mov    edx,7efefeffh
        add    edx,eax
        xor    eax,-1
        xor    eax,edx
        add    ecx,4
        test    eax,81010100h
        je    short main_loop
        ; found zero byte in the loop
On Pentiums this sadistic code is 4 times faster that our :-(.
Really, Gates has his von Braun.
So, some parts of Linux kernel may be optimized...
                    Best regards.
                                    Alexander.
