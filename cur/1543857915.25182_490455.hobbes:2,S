When timeout occur this function does not return any error values.
the callers needn't to be warn in this case ?

so page can be accessed by using vma->start virtual address....

and here the kernel access to the same page by using address returned
by vmalloc which are different from the previous one. So 2 different
addresses map the same physical page. In this case are there any cache
aliasing issues specially for x86 arch ?
