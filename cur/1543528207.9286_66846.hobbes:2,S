Suspended image _may_ contain FS caches. Probability is rather low,
but that can happen. If it happens, you have data corruption next time
you resume. Just don't do that. Also, suspended image probably
contains i-cache and d-cache. No, I'm sure you don't want to do this.

PS: IIRC, I coded swap out so that it eat memory, and relied on normal
mm techniques... So above scenarios are possible.
