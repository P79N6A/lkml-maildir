I've noticed the same sort of thing.  I have two boxes running
slackware3.6 with 2.2.1, one with scsi and one without.  After 31 days of
uptime, the one with scsi was almost 40 minutes behind and the one without
scsi was accurate (the nonscsi box has a 34 day uptime).
The scsi box had been accurate on the 2.0.x kernel as far as time goes.
Scsi card is a adaptec 1515, box is a p5-100.  
It could be just coincidence of course.

Happy?
