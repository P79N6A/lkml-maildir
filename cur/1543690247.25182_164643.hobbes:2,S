Hello all ,
I am working in squid developments oriented works.Then at presently

Squid.
For that i have upgrade my gcc and i have tried to  compiled the 
kernel ,but i am getting some errors on kernel-2.6.0-test3 on IA64 
with ia64 linux patch.
The problem is as 
HOSTCC  scripts/lxdialog/checklist.o
