  I think it might be possible to bisect further, but I
don't know how get git to do it.

  I don't believe that this actually has anything to do
with NFS.  The only way I could see NFS coming into this is the
fact that I use amd to automount home directories.
  The commit mentioned above modifies just over 100 files, very
few of which appear related to NFS.  I've attached the diifs.
It appears to be a number of fixes rolled up into one patch.
This is why I believe it might be possible to continue bisecting
with git.  But, to do that I suspect I would need to use a
different repository and/or tag or version names.
  BTW, the diffs were generated with "git diff v2.6.26-rc3"
after having done the bisection.  This is why it looks to me
like this one commit includes multiple updates.  Since all
bisection iterations were bad, the diffs against the good
version must be the diffs of the one commit.  Of course, I 
reserve the right to have made a mistake or not understand 
things completely.
  There was one other detail that seemed strange.  In the
last four bisection iterations, the kernel identified
itself as -rc2 instead of -rc3.  I assumed an update
accidentally changed it back.
