  In Linux 2.0.x and other systems sendmsg() in its second argument msg
allows msg->msg_namelen to contain nonsense if msg->msg_name is NULL (what
kinda makes sense -- NULL in msg->msg_name means that there is no address
involved, so its size is meaningless). However 2.2.x checks msg->msg_namelen
instead -- if it's nonzero, msg->msg_name is considered to be an address
even if it's NULL (and therefore error is returned). Why?
