I think over time, a set of patches and a clean kernel tree to apply
them to, is easier to handle.  Especially with such excellent tools
availble to do this now (like quilt and patch-utils).
But good luck with this, it will be interesting to see how long you can
handle maintaining the kernel in this manner.
