It's preempt-kernel-rml-2.4.19-pre8-ac1-1.patch from
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/preempt-kernel/linux-2.4/preempt-kernel-rml-2.4.19-pre8-ac1-1.patch
It applied cleanly with no mods needed and had been running fine untill this
decided to happen.  Seems like slocate's updatedb decided to jack the load up
which triggered oom?  However, the chosen process was unkillable since its the
same process listed in the oom report over and over again?
