There will be cases where there won't be enuff memory for both
framebuffers.  Most video cards will support power-saving modes or an
"off" state.  This can be used so that the user won't see the Framebuffer
get overriten with the new data, whatever gets swaped into that memory
location.

I think it would work best if the buffer where setup/maped/allocated(in
revers order), then the call to program the DAC.  It dosen't make any
differance if it is attomic, worst case the user will just see trash.
