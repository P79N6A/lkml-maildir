Yup, it's a BIOS bug. Your BIOS only marks ram up to physical address of 
4736MB as cacheable, while the actual RAM reported by the BIOS goes up 
to physical address 4800MB.
I think we had a patch in -mm to detect this case and disable the extra 
memory (64MB in this case) to keep the kernel from using it.
