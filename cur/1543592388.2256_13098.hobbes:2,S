With the only minor detail being that it DOESN'T WORK.
You're not solving the problems of GFP_BUFFER allocators
looping forever in __alloc_pages(), the deadlock can still
happen.
You've only solved the 1 specific case of highmem.c getting
a page for bounce buffers, but you'll happily let the thing
deadlock while trying to get buffer heads for a normal low
memory page!

Rik
