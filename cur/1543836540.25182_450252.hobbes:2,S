Try determining the alignment of u64 on i386.  You will be surprised.
#include <stdio.h>
typedef long long u64;
struct u64_s { u64 x; } x;
int main ()
{
  printf ("%d\n", __alignof__ (u64));
  printf ("%d\n", __alignof__ (x));
  return 0;
}
Btw, the iptables compat code was broken due to this.
Andreas.
