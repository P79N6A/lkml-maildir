Ok.  So no irqbalanced? 
Any non-standard firmware on this box like a hypervisor or weird APM
code that could be causing problems.
I'm just trying to think of things that might trip over a change in
irq handling, besides a chipset.
I want to suspect the irq migration code but it doesn't look like
irqbalanced has started at all so irq migration doesn't appear to be
happening.

Cool.  So this is clearly about irqs being delivered to multiple
cpus, and getting getting the delivery messed up for some reason.

Sure.  Anything that breaks irqs for 2.6.19 is clearly a big problem.
Can you try the debug patch below and tell me what it reports.
As long as the problem irq is not for something important this
should allow you to boot, and just collect the information.
What I am hoping is that we will see which irq or irqs are having
problems. Then we can check out how the irq controller for those
irq are programmed.
