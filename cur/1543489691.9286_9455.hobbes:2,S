We do have those in effect. The general approach with a GPL driver is
to cut bits out of other drivers and put them together with your hardware
code. The i2o scsi driver for example I did by cutting up the symbios
53c416 driver and then adding pieces from the qlogicfc driver. Very little
of it is "new" code.
