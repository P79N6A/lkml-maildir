Doing caps at a process level inside the scheduler is doable but would 
involve an extra level of complexity including locking at the process 
level to calculate process usage rates.  Also the calculation of usage 
rates would be more complex than just doing it for tasks and the fact 
that there are not separate structures for processes and threads also 
complicates the code compared to what is required otherwise (e.g. for 
Solaris).
I'm not sure that this extra complexity is warranted when it is possible 
to implement caps at the process level from outside the scheduler using 
the task level caps provided by this patch.  However, to allow the costs 
to be properly evaluated, I'll put some effort into a process level 
capping mechanism over the next few weeks.
