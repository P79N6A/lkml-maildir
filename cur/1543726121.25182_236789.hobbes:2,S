Subject: How to debug 2.6 PReP boot hang?

I have a Motorola Powerstack II Pro4000 that has PReP and OF and is not
booting in 2.6. I hangs very early, the display stays in OF graphics
mode and nothing is printed. So it does not reach vga_init in
load_kernel, and I'm not sure it even reaches load_kernel.
What is the best suggestion to debugging this? I have serial cable and
could output chars there but what is the platform-specific code snippet
that should output a char on serial port?
