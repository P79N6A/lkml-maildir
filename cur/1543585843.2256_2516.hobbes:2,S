In this case, the person(s) making the policy seem to be short on clue,
and long on agenda.
However, I can understand and agree with, from a security perspective, a
company deciding to ditch OSes that they have little to no idea about how
to handle.
I've been in the position to suggest that very action to companies, as
their $VENDOR-OS box sits in the corner and decays quietly, because
everyone either ignores it while its working, or kicks it into
'submission' when something goes wrong ...
Yeah, the _solution_ is to have IT people with lots of clue, but, well ...
*cough* ...
