i have a bare page on how i am doing it,
http://stuph.org/HOWTO-GRE_tunneling.html
yes it is bare and requires you figure out some trivial things.
the basic concept is i can take my laptop anywhere, dialup locally to anyone,
then ssh back to my server and create the tunnel and acquire my static IP

i use this for both ppp and dsl circuits
