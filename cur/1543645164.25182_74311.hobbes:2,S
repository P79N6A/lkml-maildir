Sounds reasonable enough.  What about the attached patch?  If we flip
the order of the disable_irq and spin_lock, we do not need to actually
explicitly disable preemption... the lock will do that for us.
Is this safe?
This also has the general benefit of not spinning on the lock with the
irq disabled (same sort of downside has preempting with the irq
disabled).
