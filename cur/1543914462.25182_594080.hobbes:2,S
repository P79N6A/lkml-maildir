No, I was referring to another talk that I had at the OLS with Corey 
Gough. I keep getting confusing information from Intel. Last I heard was 
that IA64 had a regression and x86_64 was fine (but they were not allowed 
to tell me details). Would you please straighten out your story and give 
me details?
AFAIK the two of us discussed some issues related to object handover 
between processors that cause cache line bouncing and I sent you a 
patchset for testing but I did not get any feedback. The patches that were 
discussed are now in mm.

Its too late for 2.6.23. But we can certainly do things for .24. Could you 
please test the patches queued up in Andrew's tree? In particular the page 
allocator pass through and the per cpu structures optimizations?
There is more work out of tree to optimize the fastpath that is mostly 
driven by Mathieu Desnoyers. I hope to get that into mm in the next weeks 
but I do not think that it is going to be available before .25.
The work of Matheiu also has implications for the page allocator. We may 
be able to significantly speed up the fastpath there as well.
