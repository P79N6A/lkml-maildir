Really fast, really long pipes in practice don't exist for 99.9% of all 
Internet users.
When you approach traffic levels that push you want to offload most of 
the TCP net stack, then TCP isn't the right solution for you anymore, 
all things considered.
The Linux net stack just isn't built to be offloaded.  TOE engines will 
either need to (1) fall back to Linux software for all-but-the-common 
case (otherwise netfilter, etc. break), or, (2) will need to be 
hideously complex beasts themselves.  And I can't see ASIC and firmware 
designers being excited about implementing netfilter on a PCI card :)
Unfortunately some vendors seem to choosing TOE option #3:  TCP offload 
which introduces many limitations (connection limits, netfilter not 
supported, etc.) which Linux never had before.  Vendors don't seem to 
realize TOE has real potential to damage the "good network neighbor" 
image the net stack has.  The Linux net stack's behavior is known, 
documented, predictable.  TOE changes all that.
There is one interesting TOE solution, that I have yet to see created: 
run Linux on an embedded processor, on the NIC.  This stripped-down 
Linux kernel would perform all the header parsing, checksumming, etc. 
into the NIC's local RAM.  The Linux OS driver interface becomes a 
virtual interface with a large MTU, that communicates from host CPU to 
NIC across the PCI bus using jumbo-ethernet-like data frames. 
Management frames would control the ethernet interface on the other side 
of the PCI bus "tunnel".

Definitely.
