Subject: [PATCH 7/9] Unionfs: remove for_writepages nfs workaround
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/21/191

This is no longer necessary since struct writeback_control no longer has a
fs_private field which lower file systems (esp. nfs) use.  Plus, unionfs now
defines its own ->writepages method.

- * Unionfs doesn't implement ->writepages, which is OK with the VFS and
- * keeps our code simpler and smaller.  Nevertheless, somehow, our own
- * ->writepage must be called so we can sync the upper pages with the lower
- * pages: otherwise data changed at the upper layer won't get written to the
- * lower layer.
- *
- * Some lower file systems (e.g., NFS) expect the VFS to call its writepages
- * only, which in turn will call generic_writepages and invoke each of the
- * lower file system's ->writepage.  NFS in particular uses the
- * wbc->fs_private field in its nfs_writepage, which is set in its
- * nfs_writepages.  So if we don't call the lower nfs_writepages first, then
- * NFS's nfs_writepage will dereference a NULL wbc->fs_private and cause an
- * OOPS.  If, however, we implement a unionfs_writepages and then we do call
- * the lower nfs_writepages, then we "lose control" over the pages we're
- * trying to write to the lower file system: we won't be writing our own
- * new/modified data from the upper pages to the lower pages, and any
- * mmap-based changes are lost.
- *
- * This is a fundamental cache-coherency problem in Linux.  The kernel isn't
- * able to support such stacking abstractions cleanly.  One possible clean
- * way would be that a lower file system's ->writepage method have some sort
- * of a callback to validate if any upper pages for the same file+offset
- * exist and have newer content in them.
- *
- * This whole NULL ptr dereference is triggered at the lower file system
- * (NFS) because the wbc->for_writepages is set to 1.  Therefore, to avoid
- * this NULL pointer dereference, we set this flag to 0 and restore it upon
- * exit.  This probably means that we're slightly less efficient in writing
- * pages out, doing them one at a time, but at least we avoid the oops until
- * such day as Linux can better support address_space_ops in a stackable
- * fashion.
