I'm assuming some bash-isms crept into the tree, as I got these:
  LD      net/built-in.o
/bin/sh: +@: not found
make[1]: warning: jobserver unavailable: using -j1.  Add `+' to parent make rule.
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
dnsdomainname: Unknown host
  UPD     include/linux/compile.h
  CC      init/version.o
  LD      init/built-in.o
  LD      vmlinux
  SYSMAP  System.map
(Note, I was building with -j3)
As the system I was using is a bit... er.... slow, I'd prefer not to kick
off another build with V=1 :-)
Not to mention, egrep -r is kinda painful over NFS on a slow link.
Pulled via git (after fixing git scripts to use bash instead of /bin/sh):
$ cat .git/HEAD
