From further reading of that text, I don't think it's what I'm looking for.
The DMA-API.txt file describes the official API for mapping an kernel
virtual address to something usable by the DMA of the bus-master
capable device.
On a many embedded ppc32 platforms, the bridge is capable of
performing DMA  (usually called IDMA) between RAM ram and
NON-busmaster-devices. Examples of such platforms are the
PowerQuiccII, PowerQuiccIII, the Marvell Discovery I,II,II, etc.
Such DMA operations are very useful because CPU cycles are
precious on many embedded platforms.
What I'm looking for is the Linux way or the Linux equivalent of:
  
http://fxr.watson.org/fxr/source/dev/marvell/gtidma.c?v=NETBSD
Oh, a side question, in Linux/Unix world, is it acceptable to DMA
data directly from/to the userspace buffer? Something like:
         int fd = open("/dev/my_asic0", O_RDWR);
         int buffer = calloc(40, 4096);
         int n = pread64(fd, buffer, 40 * 4096, SOME_ADDR);
and the IDMA engine would transfer 40 pages from my_asic0's
shared-ram directly into `buffer'.
Thanx
