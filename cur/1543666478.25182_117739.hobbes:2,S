This is way out of date.  Try pulling sources, RPMs, Driver Update
Diskettes, etc from:

I will have to go find the serial eeprom spec again and see if the
primary boot channel is specified.  If it is, this is an easy feature
to add.  I already do something similar for the aic7xxx driver.

What firmware is on the Atlas 10K?  If it is not >= B440 (which is not
even the latest available) it will likely fail spectacularly.
