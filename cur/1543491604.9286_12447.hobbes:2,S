I think this is a problem with gcc's extended syntax, which allows expressions
like
	a ? b : c = 0;
which would zero either b or c depending on the value of a. So, Gcc treats the
expression
	x = (y) ? x = 1 : x = 2;
as trying to assign the value "2", depending on the result of the "x = (y)"
expression to either "x" (if y is !0) or to "1" (if y == 0) (and then to
"x"), where "1" is of course an invalid lvalue.
So, it's enough to put braces around the second assignment.
	x = y ? x = 1 : (x = 2);
However, I still wonder why g++ allows this to compile ...
