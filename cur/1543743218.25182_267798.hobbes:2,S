Greetings;
I thought I'd get caught up on -bkx kernels and made a -bk8 just now.
But I'd tried to run gnomeradio earlier to listen to the elections, 
but it failed leaving to run, as did tvtime then too, claiming it 
couldn't get a lock on /dev/video0, and gnomeradio apparently left a 
lock on alsasound that prevented the normal gracefull shutdown by 
locking up the shutdown on the "stopping alsasound" line.  So I had 
to use the hardware reset.
I'd tried to kill the zombie earlier but couldn't.
Isn't there some way to clean up a &^$#^#@)_ zombie?
