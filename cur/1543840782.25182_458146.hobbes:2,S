The patch looks good to me, although I did not test it.

I think that testing this on a single machine is fine, but it is
preferable that you also check for any resource leaks.  That is, replace
the kernel_thread() call with -EAGAIN, then run losetup in a loop and
see whether the system possibly leaks a resource.  I did apply this sort
of testing to my original 2.4 patch.
