No, no ... the duplicate function isn't duplicated source code, only
object code. Either a config option via the markup macros that we've
been discussing, or something I hack up on the fly to debug a problem
dynamically. In terms of how the debugging-type source code is kept,
it's no different than something like systemtap or LTT (either would
work, and a normal diff could be used to keep out of tree stuff),
it's just how it hooks in is different to kprobes.

You can still instrument inline functions, you just need to hook all
the callers, not the inline itself.

If we just freeze all kernel operations for a split second whilst we do
this, does it matter? Or even if we don't ... there's a brief race where
some calls are traced, and some are not ... does that even matter?
Doesn't seem like most usages would care.
