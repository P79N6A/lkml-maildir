You missed the point.  I was talking about using copyright against patents,
and specifically in the case where patents are held by people who also want
to use the copyrighted code.  The intention is to help keep our friends

Dealing with Microsoft, or anyone else whose only motivation is to obstruct,
is an entirely separate issue.
