The "slots" member is an array, not an RCU assigned pointer. As such, after
doing rcu_dereference(slot), you can access slot->slots[i] without further
memory barriers I think?
But I agree that code now is a bit inconsistent. I've cleaned things up a
bit in my tree now... but perhaps it is easier if you send a patch to show
what you mean (because sometimes I'm a bit dense, I'm afraid).
Thanks,
