yes. I added the avg_slice code, and i removed it as well - it was
hopeless to get it right and it was causing bad performance for certain
application sloads. Current CPUs simply do not support any good way of
tracking cache footprint of processes. There are methods that are an
approximation (eg. uninterrupted runtime and cache footprint are in a
monotonic relationship), but none of the methods (including cache traffic
machine counters) are good enough to cover all the important corner cases,
due to cache aliasing, MESI-invalidation and other effects.

yes.

well it doesnt take much for a process to populate the whole L1 cache with
dirty cachelines. (which then have to be cross-invalidated if this process
is moved to another CPU.)
