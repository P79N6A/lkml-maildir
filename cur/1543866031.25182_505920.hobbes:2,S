That seems to be a logical change.  We'd need to review all the callers and
callees to make sure that they handle this change correctly.
Your changes deviate quite a lot from standard kernel coding style.  Please fix

seriously running out of bandwidth over here and ext4 has other maintainers.
Thanks.
