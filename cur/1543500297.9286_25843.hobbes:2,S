Personally I disagree, but I do agree that for the general population
you are right.
How about a switch in kassert.h that optionally causes an oops?  If you
wanted to get really fancy, take that print-backtrace code that someone
posted in this thread, and use that before _optionally_ killing the
kernel.

If an assertion fails something is REALLY WRONG, and should be printed
out as a kernel message.  The most typical use I've seen for assertions
is to warn if a null pointer if about to be dereferenced, and you
definitely want to make that known.  loudly.
Assertions should NOT occur, even in debug kernels.  An assertion is not
a FIXME.  Failure of an assertion means the impossible just occured.

They will report it as a bug report like a good little user.

I disagree, see above.  Assertion failures are very important.

I know.
I, and the C designers, used '#ifndef NDEBUG' on purpose.

Does this print out the expression correctly??  I would think that this
is more correct:
	#define kassert(cond)
		if (!cond)
			printf("assertion '" #cond "' failed\n");
