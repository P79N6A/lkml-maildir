I'm fairly sure this isn't:
/proc/net]# rm route
proc_file_unlink: deleting net/route
remove_proc_entry: net/route busy, count=1
de_put: deferred delete of route
/proc/net]# ls -l route
ls: route: No such file or directory
This on a box which is using its networking at the time...
And it breaks the route command quite drastically...
