If the files get somewhat bigger (eg. > 1G) having a bigger block
size also greatly reduces the ext2 overhead. Especially fsync() 
used to be really bad on big file but choosing a bigger block
size changed a lot.
If the database used by the original poster is based on 
something like c-isam then (AFAIR) it is in fact using
1k blocks which may explain the better results of 1k block
size. With a 100 MB file size fs management overhead should
not be that visible.
