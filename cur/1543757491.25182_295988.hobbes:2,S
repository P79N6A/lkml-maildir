The mem_maps are per-pgdat or per-node with discontig, but I have a
patch in the pipeline to take them out of there and make one for every
128MB or 256MB, etc... area of memory (for memory hotplug).  So, hanging
them off the pgdat or zone won't even work in that case, because even
the struct zone can have pretty sparse memory inside of it.  I *think*
the table is the only way to go.  But, that can wait until Monday. :)
