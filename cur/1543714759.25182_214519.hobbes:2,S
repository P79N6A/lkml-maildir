That's correct, as cpus and memory are system devices, while pci slots
belong in the pci bus directory in sysfs.

There is no problem :)

You have this today?  On what platform?  This is the first I have heard
of this.  If needed, we can merely change the pci hotplug core to allow
a hierarchy of pci slots.  Will that solve your problem?

Hm, no.  What about usb, firewire, scsi and any other future bus that
can be "hotpluggable".  The kernel doesn't treat them differently, and
we shouldn't either.

But it doesn't know about all devices in the system (like USB, firewire
and others), so this would quickly break down.  I also don't like
creating a solution that is so hard-wired for one firmware type like
ACPI.  What about Open Firmware based machines?  Pure BIOS machines?  No
firmware at all machines?  The current sysfs trees work just fine for
all of them, without users having to figure out what the access type the
kernel uses to get to the devices.
