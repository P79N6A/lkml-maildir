Possibly, but as a contract, it doesn't matter (unless these other  
countries don't do promissory estoppel. AFAIK from a google search,  
they do).
Even if the contract is invalid, if the FSF relies on the promise of  
rights in the contract to its detriment (IE are sued by the author for  
infringement or something), the promise will be enforced (to avoid  
injustice).
For an plain english description of what promissory estoppel is, see

It's a bit more than that, but that's the general idea.
