Oh yes, mea culpa, this is a terrible primitive, yet it works for this
application.  1) We don't have two callers 2) We only have atomic_inc
from the other processes, and it's ok for the atomic_inc to occur after
the atomic_read because that means the atomic_inc'er will then proceed
to up() the atomic_sub'ers semaphore, and it won't block.
I much preferred my original waiters = xchg(&sem.count, 0), but as noted
it doesn't work with sparc.  A satisfying approach would be to create
the new primitive up_down, which simplifies everything dramatically.
