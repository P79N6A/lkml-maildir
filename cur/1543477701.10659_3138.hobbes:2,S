Hi Tony,

Hmmm, another intermittent SIGSEGV.  That is the second report.
Is there anyone out there who can reproduce this on demand and
is willing and able to help me get a stack trace?
I do have one idea about this.  Could you please try this program
on your machine:
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main( int argc, const char * argv [] )
    {
	printf( "%s\n", (char *) 0 );
	return 0;
    }
Be sure to compile it with "-O2 -fomit-frame-pointer".
tkparse likes to printf through a null pointer occasionally.  If you
see "(null)" on your output, you have a printf that doesn't fall over.
If you get a segmentation fault, that would explain why your tkparse
is seg-faulting.
But it could be something else entirely.
