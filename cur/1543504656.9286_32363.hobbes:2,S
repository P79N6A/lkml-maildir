Use 2 swap partitions on each of the SCSI disks. Size them
proportionally to their speed.
I always put swap partitions in the middle of the disks, because swap
relies on fast seeks and not on fast continuous I/O performance you get
in the outer regions. Seeks to the middle of the disk take less time
statistically. But remember "middle-of-disk != middle of capacity".
