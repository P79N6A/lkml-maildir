Yes, it's a NULL pointer dereference. I copied down part of the Oops - I'll
have to put the code back before I can copy down the rest. Here's what I
have until now:
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address
00000024 printing eip:
c02a71de
pgd entry c0101000: 0000000000000000
pmd entry c0101000: 0000000000000000
.. pmd not present!
Oops: 0000
CPU:    0
EIP:    0010:[<c02a71de>]
EFLAGS: 00010286
According to System.map, c02a71de is in the middle of ide_setup_pci_device
which makes sense. ide_setup_pci_device starts at c02a7020.
