   I share the same opinion, but since most PCI cards support only
32-bit addressing and we certainly want to support both PCI and >4G
of memory on 64-bit architectures, we probably need to extend
the interface a bit to cover IOMMU-like translation as well as
pure all-in-the-same-space cases.

   This is certainly not enough and I it's probably my fault my explanation
sounded like "these are just ioremap() cookies" -- I meant to say that
these are physical addresses, suitable for example for ioremap()
or mmap() on /dev/mem.
				Have a nice fortnight
