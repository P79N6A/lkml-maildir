If you put the alignment on the type, not the variable, e.g.
  typedef int aligned_int __attribute__((aligned(128)));
  aligned_int foo;
then sizeof(foo) == 128, and the linker sees a 128-byte object,
not a 4 byte object with 128 byte alignment.
It's a subtle difference between alignment of types and alignment
of variables, but it makes sense if you think about it.
