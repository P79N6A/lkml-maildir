I've been working on the i2o_block driver for the last few months and 
in the proccess I've done some delving into the block I/O code of the
kernel. I'm now trying to understand why io_request_lock exists.
I understand that there needs to be some way of keeping the IO queues 
sane, but io_request_lock seems like overkill from my (possibly
erroneous) understanding of the block layer of the kernel.
Take the following situation. 2 cpus, two block devices (A & B) on
different major numbers (hence separate request queues):
CPU 0 gets an interrupt from block device A and gets to the
  stage where it is ready to call end_that_request_first()/last()
  to complete the request.  Before it can do so, it grabs
  io_request_lock.
Meanwhile, on CPU1, some application needs to read data from
  block dev B.  That data is not in the buffer, so it needs to
  be read from the disk.  The kernel gets to the point where it 
  is ready to call request_fn for the device, and so it does
  a spin_lock(&io_request_lock).  Since the lock is already 
  acquired by CPU0, it waits for it to be released, even
  though they are on separate queues.
This may not be the best example, but the point is that reqeusts
to different devices on different CPUs will cause lots of spin
lock contention. Is this what would happen or am I completely 
missunderstanding the implementation? Would it be better for 
performance to have a request_lock associated with each device's 
request_queue_t so blocking only occurs when the same queue might 
be touched by two CPUs?  Please  enlighten me if I've totally missed 
the mark on this.
