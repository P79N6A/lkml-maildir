Subject: [patch 11/15] ext2: preread inode backing blocks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/5/19/91

When ext2 creates a new inode, perform an asynchronous preread against
its backing block.
Without this patch, many-file writeout gets stalled by having to read
many individual inode table blocks in the middle of writeback.
It's worth about a 20% gain in writeback bandwidth for the many-file
writeback case.
ext3 already reads the inode's backing block in
ext3_new_inode->ext3_mark_inode_dirty, so no change is needed there.
A backport to 2.4 would make sense.
