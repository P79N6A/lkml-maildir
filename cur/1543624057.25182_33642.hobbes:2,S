The following output from an attempted compile of kernel 2.5.6 indicates to me that the initio scsi module has yet to be ported over to the new code. I am not a programmer so am just throwing it out there as something that would be nice to have done if I am eventually ever going to use 2.5.6 and beyond with my scsi hardware :-))
