I have been trying to grasp the Linux QoS Kernel code and have hit on
the
following snag with filters.
The only way I can see to add a new filter is via the tc_ctl_tfilter()
function
in net/sched/cls_api.c.  However, this chunk of code
       /* And the last stroke */
       chain = cops->tcf_chain(q, cl);
       err = -EINVAL;
       if (chain == NULL)
               goto errout;
has me stumped.
The reason for this is as follows
1. tcf_chain is a pointer to a function that (at least in the ATM and
CBQ
schedulers) returns the list of filters anchored by the filter_list
pointer.  The filter_list pointer is an element of struct cbq_class in
CBQ or
struct atm_flow_data in ATM.
e.g. for CBQ
static struct tcf_proto **cbq_find_tcf(struct Qdisc *sch, unsigned long
arg)
{
        struct cbq_sched_data *q = (struct cbq_sched_data *)sch->data;
        struct cbq_class *cl = (struct cbq_class *)arg;
        if (cl == NULL)
                cl = &q->link;
        return &cl->filter_list;
}
2. filter_list appears never to be initialised anywhere to any value
other than NULL.
So, if filter list is never set to a value other than NULL, then the
code chunk
above will stop any filter ever being created.
I am obviously missing something, and no doubt I'll kick myself when it
is
pointed out to me.  However, I'd rather kick myself than keep beating my
head
against a brick wall :-)  Any help gratefully accepted.
Thanks,
       Alex.
Oh yeah, I'm looking at the code for 2.2.16.
