Dave, is there a short write-up (2-3 pages) about netlink.
I like to get a quick understanding about it and how it measures
up to relayfs or vice versa. From some of the discussions here I get
the feeling that they simply might address orthogonal issues.
I recently started using relayfs for various projects after hearing
about it at OLS'03. I often need to get information out of the kernel
(either debugging in interrupt/scheduling context thus preempting use
of printk) or other information for data recording (call it trace or 
whatever).
I don't want to use existing "media" (e.g. syslog) as it either clobbers 
up that media or I have to search for the information I have put in or 
the format (typically char) is not appropriate for my use. I simply want 
a dedicated channel to get to the data in the format that I select.
I found relayfs extremely easy to use. Channel setup is a breeze.
User level consumption is through file operations. IMHO it just simply
can not get any simpler that this....
It works in interrupt/scheduling context. Has extremely low overhead
and is stable. I really would like to see relayfs be picked up.
Its a loadable filesystem that at least to this user has provided
some real value, so why would inclusion be so difficult/objectable.
You providing a short document might help me get an appreciation for
your argument.
