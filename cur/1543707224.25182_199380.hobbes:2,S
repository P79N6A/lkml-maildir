UCS-4 is as braindamaged as UCS-2 was, and for all the same reasons.
It's bloated, non-expandable, and not backwards compatible.
In contrast, UTF-8 doesn't measurably expand any normal text that didn't 
need it, is backwards compatible in the major ways that matter, and can be 
extended arbitrarily.
UCS-4 has _zero_ advantages over UTF-8. 
Please. Give it up. Anybody who thinks that _any_ other encoding format 
than UTF-8 is valid is just _wrong_. 
(Now, I'll give that a lot of people don't like Unicode, so I'll allow
that maybe you'd want to use the UTF-8 _encoding_scheme_ for some other
mapping, but I don't see that that is worth the pain any more. Unicode may
be a horrible enumeration, but in the end all font encodings are arbitrary
anyway, so the unicode haters might as well start giving up).
In short: even if you hate Unicode with a passion, and refuse to touch it
and think standards are worthless, you should still use the same
transformation that UTF-8 does to your idiotic character set of the day. 
Because the _transform_ makes sense regardless of character set encoding.
