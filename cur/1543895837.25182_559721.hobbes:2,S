I pointed out NetApp's .snapshot directories because that's a method that uses 
legal path character, but doesn't break anything.  With this method, userspace 
tools will have to be taught that : is suddenly a special character.  Userspace 
already knows that files beginning with . are special and treat them specially. 
  We don't need a new special character for every new feature.  We've got one, 
and it's flexible enough to do what you want, as proven by NetApp's extremely 
successful implementation.  Perhaps you want a slightly different interface from 
what NetApp has implemented, but what you're suggesting will change the default 
behavior of basic tools like tar and ls.  This is not a good thing.

But what you're talking about *will* break userspace.  If I do an ls in a 
directory, and get pages upon pages of versions of just one file, that's broken. 
  If I tar up a directory and get a tarball that's hundreds of times larger than 
it should be, that's broken.  If you want the files to be hidden from userspace 
applications that don't know about your backup scheme, (and it sounds like you 
do) then use the existing convention for hidden files, the prepended '.'  This 
is the universal sign for "don't mess with me unless you know what you're doing".
