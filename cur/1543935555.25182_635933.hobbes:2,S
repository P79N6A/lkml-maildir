Good point, I chose the name based simply on the usage pattern found
in all the callers.  Of your suggestions I like handle_kprobes_fault
better.
How about check_kprobes_fault?  That seems to cover what you were
getting at with maybe_handle_kprobes_fault but is shorter.  That
also fits better with the !CONFIG_KPROBES case.
