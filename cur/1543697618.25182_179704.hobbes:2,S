Yup.  Because the kernel considers the ramdisk as being "memory backed" it
doesn't do writeback into the blockdev pagecache.  If you remove the
memory-backed flag, ramdisk contributes to dirty memory in undesirable
ways.  That memory-backed flag is too overloaded and needs to be split up.
It's something I need to fix, but nobody seemed to be hurting from it up to
now so I figured it could wait until after 2.6.0.
