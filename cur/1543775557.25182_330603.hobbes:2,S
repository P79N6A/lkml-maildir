This could be easily changed.  We would just have to make some tweaks to the
bus drivers.  See below...

Yeah, agreed.

Personally, I'd like to remove .driver_data in favor of internal driver
heuristics (possibly with some <insert bus here> helper functions).  The
only driver I've ever seen that wouldn't have completely trivial breakage
is "serial-pci".
The right way to fix this driver would be to have it bind to the PCI serial
class code.  It would then have an internal ID table with flags and
instructions for each device.  If the device isn't in the table, and
controlling it is not obvious, ->probe would fail.

Yes, but the vast majority (though not all) of driver-level probe functions
completely ignore it.  We could fix drivers that need it to handle a null ID
structure.  Most of these drivers are not going to be able to handle an
unknown target device anyway, so they could just fail if there isn't an ID.

I understand.  I'm just trying to avoid some extra complexity, code, and
memory usage.  I'd like to have a more direct approach :)
Thanks,
Adam
P.S.: One final thought, the bus driver could create a new ID ( based on
available identification data) on the fly when a driver is bound to the
device.
Also, don't we need a way to turn off automatic driver binding?  The end
user might want to select a specific driver for a device.  Removing the
automatically bound driver every time is a bit ugly (and probably sometimes
impossible depending on the bus/hardware).
