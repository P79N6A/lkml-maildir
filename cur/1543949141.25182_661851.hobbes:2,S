Could we put the "e" back into "exclusive" please?

Are you sure we are OK testing WDTS_TIMER_RUN prior to taking the lock? 
Should that test happen inside the lock?

The driver uses set_bit(&wdt_status, ...) to modify bits, but it uses this
open-coded test when reading bits.  Please switch all instances of this to
use plain old test_bit().

So we support a write of "VVVVVVVVVVV"?  Seems odd.

The comments in this file are _almost_ in kerneldoc format, but they
actually aren't.  Please convert them fully (and test it!)

Surely this needs more dependencies.  The driver is x86(?)-specific and
blindly pokes at IO ports prior to determining whether the device is
actually present.  We don't want people who try loading this driver on
their ia64 servers to crash the machine, scribble on their disk drives, etc.
