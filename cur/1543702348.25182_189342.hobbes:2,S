Is this a problem? Where exactly this problem lies?

Neither does udev. Both take whatever driver gives them.

I am not sure what exactly you mean here.

kernel imposes naming scheme for exporting devices in sysfs. It is
possible to get rid of devfs_name in kernel and use those names
that must exist anyway to support udev as well. devfs has
devfsd that can call whatever naming agent you like.

it is user-space (devfsd) issue, not kernel space (devfs)

Same for sysfs. Other Unices have pageable kernel memory. If Linux
had it any memory based filesystem could benefit from it. I did not
look at backing store for sysfs patches but it is likely that same
idea could be used for devfs.

I do not argue that current devfs implementation is ugly and racy. I
just beg you to point at what makes those races "unsolvable".

I do care. Searching archives for devfs mostly brings "everyone knows
this is crap". That is why I kindly ask you to show real evidence that
the problems it has are unsolvable.

Hmm ... I really see only one - devfs names that are historically
used. Assuming that
- devfs just exports kernel names (that must exist anyway)
- sysfs provides consistent cdev view as it does for bdev
devfsd simply can take kernel name and call whatever program you like
to implement naming policy including udev. With added benefit of
removable devices support :)
