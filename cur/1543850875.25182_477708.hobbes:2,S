With CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED set, you'll get errors for devices which
have no parent set. The kobject's parent is set to the class
subsystem's kobject, meaning there is a child with name bus_id (e.
g. /sys/class/net/lo). Unfortunately, we also try to create a link
named bus_id in /sys/class/<foo>, which will fail with -EEXIST... We
should probably drop that link if we have no parent.
FWIW, my s390 system (modified FC 4) works fine with
CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED not set (parent-less devices showing up under
virtual/):
[root@t2930034 ~]# ls -l /sys/class/net/
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 0 Oct 30 20:57 dummy0-> ../../devices/virtual/net/dummy0
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 0 Oct 30 20:57 eth0-> ../../devices/qeth/0.0.f5f0/eth0
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 0 Oct 30 20:57 lo-> ../../devices/virtual/net/lo
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 0 Oct 30 20:57 sit0 -> ../../devices/virtual/net/sit0
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 0 Oct 30 20:57 tunl0 -> ../../devices/virtual/net/tunl0
Maybe the initscripts have problems coping with the new layout
(symlinks instead of real devices)?
