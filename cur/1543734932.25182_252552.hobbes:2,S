I think Linux kernel should be considered monoholitic anyway,
because, even it can load kernel modules, they execute themselves
in kernel privileged space.
You can compile some kernel parts as modules, 
so they belong to the Linux core, the only difference is that they
are loaded on demand implying all benefits and disadvantages we know.
