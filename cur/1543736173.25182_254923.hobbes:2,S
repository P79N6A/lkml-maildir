Two things that I'd check, that the memory range shows up as prefetchable 
(i.e. in lspci) and also that the memory region is mapped with ioremap and 
not ioremap_nocache. Also, what's the region defined as in /proc/mtrr? I 
think it has to be mapped as write-back for burst reads to work. When the 
CPU reads in a cache line in that memory range from the bus, that should 
hopefully get passed through as a burst read on the PCI bus, but that may be 
chipset-dependent.
Getting PIO-mode PCI reads and writes like this to work efficiently seems a 
rather difficult thing to do..
