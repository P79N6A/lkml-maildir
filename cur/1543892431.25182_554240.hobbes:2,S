Ok, thx!

Whoops :) It's running everything fine on my machine, so I think not many 
sw uses F_DUPFD ;) Will fix tomorrow.
I also have other changes to do, a couple performance related. I also 
forgot the --diffstat option for quilt refresh, that'd show the diffstat 
inside the patch.

95% or more of the code, uses get_unused_fd(), that calls with start == 0.
So the likely/unlikely are appropriate.
