Hi,
    I am trying to write to inode blocks without using the VFS layer
(filp_open, f_op->write)
    etc.
    I could use __bread to read the inode blocks correctly. But when I'm
    trying to write a block after changing it I face a strange problem.
    My changes do not show up when I cat the file but if I use dd command on
   the block device it shows my writes.
   Steps I performed :
   a) Created a file of 8K ( 2blocks ) and filled it with 'a'.
   b) Read the blocks using __bread and print(k)ed the contents.
       This worked correctly.
   c) Called __getblk for a file block, locked the buffer, made
changes to it (memcpy),
       marked buffer dirty, unlocked it and called sync_dirty_buffer.
   d) If I try to see contents of the file ( cat or vi ) they are
shown unchanged, but if I
       use dd on the raw device or use step b) to read a block the
changes made @ c)
      are seen.
 Also, if I unmount the filesystem and mount it again the changes are
visible through cat, vi etc.
Can someone explain what exactly is going wrong ?
I'm using the 2.6.13 kernel.
Thanks & Regards
