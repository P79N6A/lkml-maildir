Consider using two disks, now you only have 12+ files to worry about.
Or 4 disks with 6 files on each.  You get more storage space too.
Having to use several disks may look like a limitation, but it is only
temporary as drive technology progress.  Definitely go for scsi with
the highest available spin rate, that gives lower latency.  And 
connecting a lot of them is easy enough, particularly with LVD.
