  Interesting, doesn't work for me, and I have a note from Alan Cox which
seems to indicate it doesn't work for him, either.

I have looked in the changelog in the driver directory, for ac2, and for
19-pre2, and find nothing about the bits used in the control registers.
Nor would I expect it to, this is in the chip spec sheets, and if I had
written the code would be in very terse form in the definition of the data
structure as well.
I'm still looking for the spec sheets, somewhat limited by time. I found
only the definition of the 0x20 bit in the writable mask, and the problem
seems to stem from the change in init from "0xff" to "~0x10" at least on
one machine. Before I go offering that as a solution I want to understand
what the bits are doing (or at least intended to do). I try very hard not
to offer "this works for me but I don't know why" fixes.
