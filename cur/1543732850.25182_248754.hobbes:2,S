It doesn't abuse the elevator fields any more. That was fixed by the
packet-writing-avoid-bio-hackery patch which is already in -mm.
One problem that does remain though, is that when dumping huge amounts
of data to a CD or DVD disc (so that you get memory pressure), the
effective writing speed of other block devices (like IDE hard disks)
is reduced to the same speed as the packet device.
I have posted a patch that fixes this problem by limiting the amount
of writeback data in the packet driver, but unfortunately it makes the
effective writing speed of the packet device suffer a lot. The proper
fix is probably to improve the filesystem and/or VM code to start I/O
operations in sequential order a lot more often than it currently
does.
