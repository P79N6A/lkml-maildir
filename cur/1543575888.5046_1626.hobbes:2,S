losetup allows for setting a starting offset within a file for the loop
block device. There however is no length parameter to permit setting the
length. Adding a length parameter would allow for multiple fs images in
a single file (or device) and would correctly handle programs like
resize2fs.
What do you think? We could add a lo_length to struct loop_device and
return that if it was non-zero and less than the physical length
calculated normally by figure_loop_size().
While I'm at it why are loop_sizes[] and loop_blksizes[] not part of
struct loop_device now?
