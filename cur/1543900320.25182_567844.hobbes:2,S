The tie in between allocator and kswapd is essentially unchanged,
so if allocators are dropping below the watermarks at the specified
order, reclaim will be triggered at that order.  Reclaim continues
until we return above the high watermarks, at the order at which
we are reclaiming.
What lumpy brings is a greater targetting of effort to get the pages.
kswapd now uses the desired allocator order when applying reclaim.
This leads to pressure being applied to contigious areas at the
required order, and so a higher chance of that order becoming
available.  Traditional reclaim could end up applying pressure to
a number of pages, but not all pages in any area at the required
order, leading to a very low chance of success.  By targetting
areas at the required order we significantly increase the chances
of success for any given amount of reclaim.  As we will reclaim
until we have the desired number of free pages, we will have to
reclaim less to achieve this compared to random reclaim.
This certainly is appealing intuitivly, and our testing at higher
orders shows that the cost of each reclaimed page is lower and more
importantly the time to reclaim each page is reduced.  So for a
'continuing' consumer like an incoming packet stream, we should
have to do much less work and thus disrupt the system as a whole
much less to get its pages.
Where demand for atomic higher order pages is not heavy we would
expect kswapd to maintain free levels pages more readily and so
under higher demand.  Though it should be stressed without placement
control success rates drop off significantly at higher orders as
the probabality of reclaim succeeding on all pages in the area
tends to zero.

It is not in the least bit clear if the problem is resolved or if the
reporters have simply gone quiet.
Overall the approach taken in lumpy reclaim seems to be a logical
extension of the regular reclaim algorithm, leading to more
efficient reclaim.
