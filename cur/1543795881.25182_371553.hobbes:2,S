Setting everything to n can still be done in single pass, but that 
requires working around the normal API and setting the values directly, 
e.g.:
	for_all_symbols(i, sym) {
		if (!(sym->flags & SYMBOL_NEW))
			continue;
		switch (sym->type) {
		case S_BOOLEAN:
		case S_TRISTATE:
			sym->user.tri = no;
			sym->flags &= ~SYMBOL_NEW;
		}
	}
Now you only need to flush the old precomputed values 
(sym_clear_all_valid()) and you're done.

The kconfig data is a directed acyclic graph, which allows to do most 
operation deterministically in a single pass.
The problem is to transform the data from a valid state to another valid 
state. The normal API allows only changes which keep the data in a valid 
state (e.g. you can't set a not visible symbol), but it's possible to 
bypass this and set multiple symbols, flush the old state and a new state 
will generated which is consistent with the Kconfig rules.
Currently only conf_read() does this, i.e. you can throw pretty much any 
.config at it and it will generate a valid (but not necessarily useful) 
config from it.

This is not how it works (see above), reading the .config and user 
interface changes are two different things.
After the config has been read, the data is brought into a consistent 
state, which may mean the actual symbol value may be different, as they 
are limited by their dependencies.

There are no special guard symbols, so if a SCSI driver is requested, this 
means CONFIG_SCSI needs to be set.
