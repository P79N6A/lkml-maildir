Subject: [patch 10/11] ipvs: fix connection leak if expire_nodest_conn=1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Julian Anastasov <ja@ssi.bg>
There was a fix in 2.6.13 that changed the behaviour of
ip_vs_conn_expire_now function not to put reference to connection, its
callers should hold write lock or connection refcnt. But we forgot to
convert one caller, when the real server for connection is unavailable
caller should put the connection reference. It happens only when sysctl
var expire_nodest_conn is set to 1 and such connections never expire.
Thanks to Roberto Nibali who found the problem and tested a 2.4.32-rc2
patch, which is equal to this 2.6 version.
