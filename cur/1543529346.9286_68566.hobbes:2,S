We now have a working port of reiserfs for 2.3.49, and I am not sure whether you
consider us pending.  Can reiserfs get in?
Putting us in as an experimental file system until we are accepted by the
community as known stable is just fine.
Our 2.2 version seems to be accepted by the users on our reiserfs mailing list
as stable.
We'll port it to the new 2.3.51 starting immediately, the 2.3.49 version will
hit our webserver in a few hours.
Sorry we tweaked longer than we should have, and created inconvenience for you.
Hans
