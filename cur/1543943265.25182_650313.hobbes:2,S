Subject: [PATCH RESEND] hci_usb: another device with buggy SCO support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This unbranded bluetooth USB dongle causes the following message to
repeatedly appear in the kernel logs:
    hci_scodata_packet: hci0 SCO packet for unknown connection handle 92
This patch solves the issue. I'm not sure of its correctness, it is based
on work by Ossi Berg and Tim Gardner on the Ubuntu bug tracker.
