I don't think I understand that first sentence. (Let me respond anyways ;-)
As of now, the Linux kernel is not so platform-specific that you need
different kernel images for different BIOS revisions, or different
motherboard layouts. When you start putting platform magic numbers in the
kernel config, this is the result, and this is the *worst* possible outcome.
ACPI lets the OS manage the platform by determining this stuff at run-time
(as opposed to compile-time) so one kernel can handle all platform
configurations.

I (and others) have looked at it. It's a pretty cool patch, but it really
isn't the right way to do things.
