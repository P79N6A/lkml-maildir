None of the 2.5.48- bk or mm kernels lets me mount root,
while 2.5.47 works fine.  It doesn't matter wether it is
a smp machine with scsi raid-1 or a up with plain ide.
Possibly some devfs change that went into 2.5.48?
I have been using devfs for a long time now. Most
people don't, and they seems able to run 2.5.48.
