Well, at least for me...  at boot time we run into various limitations 
from the current kernel approach of coding purely userspace activities 
in the kernel, simply because a vehicle for implementing early-boot 
userland operations did not exist.
This klibc patchkit removes stuff that does not need to be in the 
kernel, and provides a platform for improving IP autoconfig, NFS root, 
MD/DM root setup, and various other early-boot activities.
A lot of the larger distros have been moving in this direction anyway, 
by necessity.  They have been stuffing more and more [needed] logic into 
initrd [which is often really initramfs these days], to deal with 
complex boot and root-mounting scenarios like iSCSI and multi-path.
