the default limit in proc scales with memory (to avoid really bad
stuff), you can oversize it to 2^16 if you want. 
Going over 2^16 is not too good an idea (16 bit counters overflow),
especially if you have hostile users (read: students) on the machine,
since this is the kind of scenario you can trigger on purpose.
