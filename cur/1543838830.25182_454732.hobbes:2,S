I know and that's what I use, but it wasn't standard on my distro
(debian, ok, my fault...) and the problem is still there for pretty much
any other class of device in the system... (and mount by label isn't a
udev thing.. won't fix anything but mountable devices which is fairly
limitative, no help with usb vs. firewire vs. ata cd-writers etc....
udev can do it but isn't configured to do so by default on distros)
