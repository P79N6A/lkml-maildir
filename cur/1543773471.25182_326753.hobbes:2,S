Shouldn't this be listed in Changes? It looks like Changes only mentions
the existance of udev, but doesn't specify a required version, despite
there being a version requirement. (Not that I really think too many
people would think to look, but it would at least have a chance of
reaching people who look carefully at kernels but don't read the mailing
list)
