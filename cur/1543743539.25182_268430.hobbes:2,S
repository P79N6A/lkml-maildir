By the way, the X server runs. There is no problem with that.
If I start it (say, with ICE as a window manager starting up an xterm)
*immediately after boot* I get a clean, black screen. It should be dark
green. I get the frame for the xterm. No xterm. I can right click to get
the menu to display on the screen but it gets locked there. I can right
click again to get a working menu and choose to logout.
If I do something befor starting it, the screen is filled with junk.
Something is writing to the video ram. If I close it and restar it,
different junk.
It seems that the initialization of the i810 is leaving its video ram
free to be grabbed and used.
I saw from the ChangeLog that the 810 initialization code was cleaned up.
It used some strange work around to do something the author thought was
unneccessary and which he cleaned up. It was changed, items reordered,
etc. Might that have something to do with the problem?
