Why?
Even if an NMI happens in the middle of a read-modify-write sequence that 
is critical, the NMI exit is supposed to undo whatever it was that the NMI 
entry did, so the preempt counters are "safe" wrt NMI: they may change, 
but they always change back by the time anybody cares.
This, btw, is something we depend on wrt _normal_ interrupts too. It's why 
people can read/modify/write preempt count without having to disable 
interrupts.
