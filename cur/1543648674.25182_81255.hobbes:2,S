Cool, I thought my 486sx20/4M was a good achievement :-)

I have found that 16450-based serial ports are unreliable under
2.5.x.  Enabling interrupt un-masking didn't help, and I suspect that
it is just the generally more bloated kernel making the cache, (or in
the case of a 386, the pre-fetch unit :-) ), less efficient, and
causing data to be lost.

Yes, I've noticed the same thing during my experiments with low-memory boxes.

I am also very interested in it.
