You're right. I should have kept the "RFC/" part, since the reason for
breaking it up was more for review and comments than to actually apply.

There were a couple of "impure moves". But those where done with two
different commits. So the git-diff -M produced a "pure move" and then a
patch against the end result. So no, I didn't put in any effort to make
them all "pure" moves. Git did that for me.

I usually do always try to make my patches compile for every patch. But
this was a strange case and I wanted it to be more reviewable than
compiling at every stage. But if something can be agreed on, I'll make
sure my next patch series conforms to the "compile at every stage" rule.
