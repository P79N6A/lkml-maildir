I suppose so, but the problem is slightly worse:
One does not need 100 HBAs to trigger the BUG_ON: 
It is sufficient to have a few HBAs and to insmod/rmmod the driver a few 
times.
Since the host_no is choosen with a mere counter increment 
in scsi_host_alloc():
      shost->host_no = scsi_host_next_hn++; /* XXX(hch): still racy */
Unused `host_no's are not reused and the 100 limit is reached even on 
smaller systems.
I have no idea of why someone would do repeated insmod/rmmods, though.
(But someone did).
	Simon.
