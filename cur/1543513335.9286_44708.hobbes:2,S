That still doesn't let you get rid of the bforget(): remember that a
partial truncate() still needs to be dealt with, and you can't work out
which buffers to discard in that case without doing the full metadata
walk.  Just having a per-inode buffer queue doesn't help there (although
it _would_ help solve the case which we currently get wrong, which is
directory data blocks, since we never partially truncate a directory).
