 If you only have a line similar to this one:
..TIMER: vector=0x31 pin1=2 pin2=0
then a normal I/O APIC interrupt (pin1) is used and the patch is
irrelevant. 
 If you have lines like these:
..TIMER: vector=0x31 pin1=-1 pin2=0
...trying to set up timer (IRQ0) through the 8259A ...
..... (found pin 0) ...works.
then IRQ 0 is not registered so far (pin1 is -1) and add_pin_to_irq() 
(added by your patch) is invoked ordinarily for pin2 like for other
interrupts.
 But if you have lines like these:
..TIMER: vector=0x31 pin1=2 pin2=0
..MP-BIOS bug: 8254 timer not connected to IO-APIC
...trying to set up timer (IRQ0) through the 8259A ...
..... (found pin 0) ...works.
then IRQ 0 needs to be rerouted from pin1 to pin2 and replace_pin_at_irq() 
is intended to do so.  I'd be pleased to hear from someone with such a
system (they are quite common surprisingly); I'll simulate such a
configuration with my development system anyway.
 Other timer configurations (they are two more, sigh) don't matter as they
don't route IRQ 0 via an I/O APIC.  They are very rare as well.
