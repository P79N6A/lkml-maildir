Subject: scheduling in kmalloc()

if we use any thing other than GFP_ATOMIC, does it result in scheduling
out the process if there is no memory available?
with GFP_KERNRL, I think we try freeing pages to service the current
request.
or is there any possibility of kmalloc() failing even with GFP_KERNEL?
thx,
Vasu.
