Sigh... 
Xmms was a simple test case long forgotten but most still think all I did was 
make an xmms scheduler. Deleting one character from sched.c before all of my 
patches would make the scheduler ideal for xmms. Any braindead idiot can tune 
a scheduler for just one application. An application that changes it's 
behaviour dynamically well in the setting of a particular scheduler, though? 
Should a scheduler be tuned to suit a coding style or quirk? 
I should go back to lurking before people start calling me names. This thread 
has gone long enough for that. If I hadn't said anything it would have died 
out by now. Instead I'm drawing attention to my fundamentally flawed code.
