The problem with that is you get a bunch of symlinks to that parent
device that you really don't want to have, when we have a device that is
associated with a class.
I was thinking of creating a /sys/devices/virtual/ to put these
unassociated devices into, and I'll play around with that a bit.  I
don't know if we will hit some namespace issues with all of the
different devices that aren't associated with a "real" device if we lump
them all together into one directory...
