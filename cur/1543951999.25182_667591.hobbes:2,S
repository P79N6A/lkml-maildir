Maybe you should follow up the tree to ensure that all parent groups
have access to the device too? Or alternatively, cache the results of
this lookup whenever permissions for a device change?

What's the rationale for that?

But this isn't necessarily crossing namespaces. It could be used for
device control in the same namespace (e.g. allowing a job to access a
raw disk for its data storage rather than going through the
filesystem).
