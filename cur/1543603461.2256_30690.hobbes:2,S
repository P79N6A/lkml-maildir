This doesn't negate the fact that it *is* broken in linus-latest, and
it *isn't* fixed in alan-latest.
Try compiling a kernel with (at least)
# CONFIG_INPUT_GAMEPORT is not set
CONFIG_SOUND=y
CONFIG_SOUND_ESSSOLO1=y
CONFIG_SOUND_ES1370=y
and see what I mean.
I get:
ld -m elf_i386  -r -o sounddrivers.o soundcore.o es1370.o esssolo1.o maestro.o maestro3.o ac97_codec.o
esssolo1.o: In function `gameport_register_port':
esssolo1.o(.text+0x6d60): multiple definition of `gameport_register_port'
es1370.o(.text+0x7ea4): first defined here
esssolo1.o: In function `gameport_unregister_port':
esssolo1.o(.text+0x6d64): multiple definition of `gameport_unregister_port'
