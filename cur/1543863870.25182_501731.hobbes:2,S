Consider it addressed to those responsible.

Well, the 'new' entries don't interfere with old-- and we inevitably
are going to end up with a situation where some software can only read
the 'new' entries and some software can only read the 'old', otherwise
why offer compatability at all?  I interpreted the
CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED option to mean 'also offer the deprecated
entries in addition to the new structure', otherwise the name should
be CONFIG_SYSFS_OLDSTYLE or some such to imply they're mutually
exclusive....

As it turns out, nothing (I made some error somewhere initially when
testing it).
Apologies if I wasn't clear.
(Well, it's incomplete like my original patch was in that it only
changed the device symlinks for controlX and pcmX; the other entries
still had device entries pointing at card*).
