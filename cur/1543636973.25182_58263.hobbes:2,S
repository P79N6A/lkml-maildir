Yes the C99 people did give in on this point :-). But only until
recently. And really the only way to find out what the warinigs
are about is to have a look at cparse.y...

Sure, but this extension is actually a justifyed one.

Da, kanieczna. Ja znaju: It's resulting in semi "self modifying" code.
Sometimes usefull but not in 80% where they are actually used is the
({ ... }) extension for example as well. In most of the cases where its
used we should simply rely on the fact that gcc got now much better at
doing function inlining instead. See the spinlock patch for example.
Best abuse example are the byte swapping macros...
But one quite justifyed example of usage is the
wait_event_interruptible(), where it's used to assert repeated condition
evaluation. However this puts the fact aside that 
wait_event_interruptible() isn't a polite abstraction in first place...
