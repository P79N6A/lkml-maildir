So... will you fix input and usb? Their maintainers seem to prefer
simplicity of frozen system.
Also, can you write down rules for drivers to follow?
Like... 'if you get a request after system suspend started, you may
not kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL)'
 - because disk driver may be already suspended
- hmm, what happens if disk driver _is_ suspended? Let's say I'm v4l
driver on cpu1. Someone may talk to me _while_ disk driver is being
suspended... and if I'm after disk driver in pci order, I may only
learn about suspend _after_ I do the wrong kmalloc.
