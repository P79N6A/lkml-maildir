I suspect quite a lot of changes to loop.c would fall out.  For a start, in
a sufficiently-simplified implementation lo_pending would perhaps go away -
just test the NULLness of the top of the list of BIOs.

That would seem sensible, but I don't immediately see how to do it
non-racily without changing the API or by adding a `struct completion' to
the task_struct.  Because the task might be exitting-but-not-exitted, and
still using resources which the kthread_stop() caller wants to release.
