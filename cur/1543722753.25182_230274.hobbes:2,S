Or just a list of elastic files in ~/.elastic. Even better, could mark them
as "Just delete", "compress"; could go as far as giving (fallback?) globs
to select files for each treatment ("If space gets tight, delete *~ files,
and compress *.tex that haven't been read in a week"). Sounds like a fun
Perl project...

A daemon or cron job running as root can do that just fine. Or you can set
it up for your own files.

Buy a larger disk. Make sure sum of all hard quotas is less than filesystem
size. Need that anyway; so it reduces to a one-user problem with per-user
solutions.

Ugly.

As said, all this buys very little for a lot of hairy code in the kernel,
which will be rarely used (and whose bugs will show up when it is badly
needed to work right). Besides, I strongly oppose automatic file
disposal. I love the Unix way exactly because I decide what to do (no "I
know better than you what to do", "you dumb user aren't supposed to do
that, so you have no right to know", no "undelete deleted files, but only
sometimes; it just might still be around, but if space got tight it isn't"
(this is even worse...))
