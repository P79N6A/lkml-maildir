I started having the same problem with my LNE100TX and switched it 
out with another LNE100TX and had the same problem.  Figured it was 
my BP6 SMP motherboard and ordered a new computer. Doh. :-)
Using 2.4.2-ac20.
Current LNE100TX having problems (other is different Rev):
  Lite-On Communications Inc LNE100TX (rev 20)
The first card would get "unexpected IRQ trap at vector d0" before 
dying whereas the second one didn't give that indication.  It would 
just freeze and the traditional "NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit 
timed out" message.
