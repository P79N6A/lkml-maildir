I had a total of three occurrences of a stuck touchpad on
 my Dell D610 since upgrading to Fedora 7, with custom
 kernels (FC6 was used up to 2.6.22-rc7-git2, never saw
 the issue):

I always use the touchpad and never the stick, and
 actually found out that when the touchpad stops working
 with the cursor disappearing, it's a good workaround to
 move the stick to get the cursor back (I assume moving
 the stick is what actually causes the above messages).
