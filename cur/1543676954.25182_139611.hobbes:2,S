Bartlomiej was actually the one who suggested this patch, I didn't do it
on my own :)
Anyway, there are only 2 places in the whole kernel that want a
pci_present() check, this place, and drivers/sbus/sbus.c.  sbus.c can
probably be changed to not need it at all, but I did it this way to be
safe.
So that leaves only this file.  Jeff Garzik and I talked about removing
pci_present() as it's not needed, and I think for this one case we can
live without it.  Do you want me to make the pci_present() macro earlier
in this file, so it's readable again?  I don't want to put it back into
pci.h.
thanks,
