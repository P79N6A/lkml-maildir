I've found one little glitch in your patch...
                            deafult:    model_id = "386 SX";
                                        break;
Should probably be default, right?! :^)
Apart from this, it seems to work just fine. Great job! I *really* hope it
makes into v2.3.xx...

Oh, and there's quite a lot of slack spaces and a few ^M (that is, DOS
linebreaks), could you remove them? I'm being nitpicky now, but why have
8 spaces when you can have one tab...
