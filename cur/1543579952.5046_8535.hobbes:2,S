I'm having a problem when I try to profile a program that
fork()'s. The problem is that it does count how many times I'm in
a function, but nothing seems to use any cpu time at all.
If I call setitmer(ITIMER_PROF, ...) again after the
fork, it works as expected.  fork() doesn't seem to copy the
timer(s). On other OS's, I don't seem to have to do this.
I'm having this problem with both 2.2, and 2.4.  I think it used
to work in older versions.
Is this a bug, or is this intentional?
Kurt
