The problem that was addressed in OS/2 was that one user using locale A
would create some files using non-ascii characters.  Then a user using
locale B would access these files, but the characters in those names did
not make sense in his locale.  Storing the file names in unicode allowed
the characters to always translate to the correct characters in the
user's locale, when the charset allowed it.  I'm not familiar enough
with the European locales to give specific examples.  It was never an
issue in the U.S. :^)
The OS/2 kernel has locale information for each process, so this
actually works very well there.  I will admit that it was a mistake not
to change the default behavior when we ported this to Linux.

I know that JFS1 did not.  I'm not sure about JFS2, since it was ported
from the same OS/2 code base.

I hope I explained that well enough above.
