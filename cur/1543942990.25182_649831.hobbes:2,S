no, your patch is not needed:

read the complete code:
        /*  Save value of CR4 and clear Page Global Enable (bit 7)  */
        if ( cpu_has_pge ) {
                cr4 = read_cr4();
                write_cr4(cr4 & ~X86_CR4_PGE);
        }
        /* Flush all TLBs via a mov %cr3, %reg; mov %reg, %cr3 */
        __flush_tlb();
first first turn off PGE and do a cr3 flush - that gets rid of all TLBs.
but even if it didnt get rid of it, the mirror image function, 
post_set(), we turn PGE back on in the cr4 _after_ we've flushed the 
TLBs via the cr3 - that will flush all TLBs again.
