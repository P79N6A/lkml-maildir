Grumble grumble grumble grumble.  I was upgrading some bits of my system
(util-linux, net-tools, libslang, and maybe a couple other things) to go
along with my new 2.1.132
kernel.  Unfortunately, after a reboot, netscape refused to work,
complaining
	netscape: can't resolve symbol '__xstat'.
I am sure I have seen this message before, but I don't remember why or
what I did to make it go away :-(.  If anyone can help me, I'd really
appreciate it.
