Also: please rebuild "xargs" and install first. Otherwise, a lot of 
build script etc that use "xargs" won't ever trigger the new limits (or 
lack thereof), because xargs will have been installed with some old 
limits.
Perhaps more worrying is if compiling xargs under a new kernel then means 
that it won't work correctly under an old one.
