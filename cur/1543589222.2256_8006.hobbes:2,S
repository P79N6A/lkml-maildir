James,  I only glanced at the patch, but IIRC it just did
route_me_harder() on everything.  This is, unfortunately, no longer
"Best Practice": the prevailing trend is to reroute only when
something has actually been changed, to avoid overriding the socket
binding, etc.
See mangle for an example (store old values, see if they changed).  I
think this would be more complex, but still possible in your case, no?
Thanks,
Rusty.
