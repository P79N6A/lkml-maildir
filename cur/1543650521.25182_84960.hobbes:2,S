I have not finished journaling support yet, but it will encrypt before it hits 
the journal. Yes, there should be no problem with mmap.

I will be going over the cryptoAPI code tonight and seeing if I can change the 
crypto routines to use the cryptoAPI, as it would be much easier to maintain.

The SHA algorithms, as well as MD5 are used for message digests (hashing). 
This is used to transform the key prior to passing the key off to the 
specific algorithms key setup functions. I have also thought about, albeit 
not too much, about using message digests/signatures as a file integreity 
mechanism. 
I should also mention that deletion of files on ext3sj will use DoD standards 
for secure file deletion by overwriting the data with all 0's, all 1's, and 
then random data. So, before you delete a file, make sure you really want to 
delete it, because there won't be a way to recover it.
