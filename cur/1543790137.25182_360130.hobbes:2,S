(Is this thread OK here or should this go off line? I'm fine either way.)
I also found it interesting. It correctly recognized that I'm in the
Bay Area in California, but it placed me in a group in Palo Alto,
which is not where I really am, and it placed the Palo Alto group
below San Jose which isn't where Palo Alto really is.
None the less, quite interesting.
