I don't use UDMA.  I probably would like to, but last I heard the UDMA
drivers for the chipset were beta.  Besides that is not part of the
point.
The machine didn't change between corruption and noncorruption.  What
changed was I reformatted the hard drive using the newer linux and it
went away.  It seems there are still some bugs in that new translation
stuff that went it.  I don't know if they have been fixed or not.  I was
just saying they had caused me similar corruption and messages to some
shown here.  AGAIN THIS WAS ON THE SAME BOX.  This one I am on now, the
similar one, never had the corruption or messages.
