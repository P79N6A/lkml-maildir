"use spin_lock_init instead of SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED"
i'm a bit confused with SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED removal
 I just did the below mentioned change
but then came to know that  spin_lock_init is defined as
# define spin_lock_init(lock)                                   \
        do { *(lock) = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED; } while (0)
so what difference does it make..
eventually replacing SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED with itself
or is it just that this one [SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED] also needs 
to be replaced with __SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED?
after thought with CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK does make a diff
let me know if this is fine ..
