What happen if someone need trace points in "normal kernel development" (which
appears to be the case, see blktrace and latency tracer) ?

What kind of code are you calling from your instrumentation sites to break your
kernel so easily ? Or perhaps are you instrumenting the page fault handler
which, yes, can have side effects? My goal is exctly to provide the kind of
code that can be called from any kernel site without breaking it!
