Thanks, that explains a lot. However, I don't have any XFS filesystems 
mounted over loop devices on ext3. Earlier in the day I had iso9660 on 
loop on xfs, could that have caused the issue? It was unmounted and 
deleted when this panic occurred.
I'll probably just try and recompile the kernel with 8k stacks and see 
how it goes. Screw the support, we're unlikely to get it anyway. :-P
Many thanks,
Chris
