Sure there is. There's the gain that if you lock the front door but not 
the back door, somebody who goes door-to-door, opportunistically knocking 
on them and testing them, _will_ be discouraged by locking the front door.
Never mind that he still could have gotten in. After all, if you locked 
the back door too, he might still have a crow-bar.
It is a logically fallacy to think that "perfect" is good. It's not. 
Anybody who strives for perfection will FAIL. 
What's good is "incremental changes". Something that everybody and his dog 
can look at for five seconds and say "oh, that's obviously fine", and then 
can get more testing (because "everybody and his dog" saying "that's fine" 
doesn't actually prove much of anything).
This has nothing to do with security, btw. It's universally true. You get 
absolutely nowhere by trying to redesign the world.
