 A task gate is an absolute must for the double fault if we want to have a
working handler.  Intel warns the CPU state can be inconsistent when a
double fault happens and for example I've seen cases where the saved CS
and EIP were not matching each other (tests were not conducted under
Linux).  Also SS:ESP might be unusable leading to a triple fault.
 The NMI should be left alone, though, I think as we want it to be fast
for the NMI watchdog.  Task gates are not necessarily fast (depending on
how you define "fast").
