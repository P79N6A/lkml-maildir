If it is supposed to survive two arbitrary disk failures something is
wrong with that figure. They store 12 logical sectors in 20 physical
sectors across 4 drives. With two lost disks there are 10 physical
sectors left from which we want to reconstruct 12 logical sectors.
That is impossible.
OTOH it is possible to construct a system with optimal capacity and
ability to survive any chosen number of disk failures. This can be
done using either a Reed-Soloman code or Lagrange interpolation of
polynomials over a finite field.
However I guess those techniques would be inefficient in software.
