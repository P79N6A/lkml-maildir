DBGU is without DMA.

As mentioned, maybe it was already there, but I did not run into it
earlier. I have to figure that out. But, at 115200 and a 1 byte
receive-'fifo' on DBGU, and still interrupt locks somewhere in the
tree up to 300us, it is a simple calculation that we can run into
overrun conditions...
Notice that without these interrupt handler splitup, it was much, much
much worse...
So, for me it is not a big deal, because it is just a terminal, and
with my shaky fingers I usually do not type that fast ;-))
