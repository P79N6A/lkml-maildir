It can be alloacted via vmalloc and AFAIK it is not swappable by
default. This doesn't sound like a very good idea though.

Yes. See /proc/kcore for a very obvious example. Also "Linux device
drivers second edition" has many good exmaple on the subject in the
chapter devoted to mmap.

Of course. This is the definition of shared memeory...
Just one thing to keep in mind - 'allocating' memory really doesn't do
that much as you might think. Until the memory is *accessed* for the
first time, all you got for the most part are some entries in a table
somwehere...

Depends how you got the shared memeory. With mmap() it's yes (for
regular files at least), with shmget/shmat it's no by default. For mmap
of non regulat files (e.g. device files) anything the device file writer
had in mind is the answer.
man shmget, shmat, shmat and finally mmap will help you a lot.
