The raid trouble in mm also exists in 2.5.70-bk7
I get several stack traces and a final oops
in interrupt when trying to boot.  Thanks to 
matroxfb and the 8x8 font, I now have a nice long trace.
This is not the first in the row, but not the last one either.
My reports about mm always were the last one.
After this came several messages about unregistering md1
(the raid-0 array) before the final oops.
I use raid-1, raid-0, preempt, smp & devfs, all fs'es
are ext2.  I don't use modules.
Here is the trace:
raid0_run

blk_queue_make_request
