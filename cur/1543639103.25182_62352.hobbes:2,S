   So what we want is something more like:
Yes that would work.
I'm starting to become leery about this percpu stuff, which ends up
moving critical data structures (in this case softnet) out of the main
kernel image (and thus out of the single large PAGE_SIZE entry many
platforms use to map that part of the kernel).
Since all the per-cpu stuff ends up in the same cluster of bootmem
it probably doesn't matter so much.  Here's to hoping that's true :-)
