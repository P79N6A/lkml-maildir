This looks like a logical extension but the question is, is it worth
it?  I don't know about a case so far where this is a bottle neck. 
But any solution will cost every process, regardless of whether it
uses signals often or not.
So, if your solution can avoid or keep the cost very very low, it
might be worth using such a change.  Otherwise the ol' saying applies:
avoid signals at all costs.
