I agree that running the reaper on the wrong CPU is not the best way to go about it.
But it seems like disabling it is even worse, unless I missing something. ie wasting
memory.
btw What kind of troubles were you talking about ? Performance or robustness ?
As I said performance wise it does not make sense to run reaper on the wrong CPU but
it does seems to work just fine from the correctness (locking, etc) perspective. Again
it's totally possible that I'm missing something here :).
Thanks
