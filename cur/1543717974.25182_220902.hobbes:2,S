Hyok's mailer has done it _again_.  The CC list randomly changed from
linux-arm-kernel to lkml, so what you saw was a reply to one of my
messages on the linux-arm-kernel list, being copied out of context
to lkml.
This is at least the third time that I've known the CC list to randomly
change for no reason when Hyok has been replying, and this is the third
time I'm complaining about it.
Hyok - unless you stop this fscking annoying behaviour, you can expect
people to start ignoring you.  If its your mail client doing it, please
change your mail client to something more stable.  You're just _really_
pissing people off with what's currently happening with the CC: line
and that's not helping you one bit.
Thanks.
