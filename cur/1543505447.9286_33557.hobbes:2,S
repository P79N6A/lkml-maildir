     I realize that now but did not realize it then since amoung other things
they had these nifty things that would attach to the parallel port, I thought
it probably would require device drivers.
     I did not realize that all that device was was an ordinary card drive that
connects to the parallel port (ick) and that it was just DOS format, the camera
store idiots told me it was proprietary.  A lot of people pointed me at gphoto
	
http://www.gphoto.org/
     Which does support downloading via serial, but it sounds like an even
better solution would be to find a SCSI card drive and just mount the file
system.  I know I've seen them advertised before, I don't know if acquiring
one involves becoming an amputee.
     At any rate, you're right it is definitely not a kernel issue, but I
didn't know that when I posed the original question, and obviously there was
a lot of interest judging from all of the e-mail I received.
