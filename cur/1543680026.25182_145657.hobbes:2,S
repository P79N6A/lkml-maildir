I'm seeing extreme X starvation with this patch under 2.5.74-mm2 when
starting a CPU hogger:
1. Start a KDE session.
2. Launch a Konsole
3. Launch Konqueror
4. Launch XMMS
5. Make XMMS play an MP3 file
6. On the Konsole terminal, run "while true; do a=2; done"
When the "while..." is run, X starves completely for ~5 seconds (e.g.
the mouse cursor doesn't respond to my input events). After those 5
seconds, the mouse cursor goes jerky for a while (~2 seconds) and then
the system gets responsive.
PS: There are no user processes reniced.
