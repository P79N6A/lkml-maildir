See the beginning of my message... it only does so if _KERNEL_ is 
defined. Since other header files also directly include compiler.h even 
though they already include kernel.h, I didn't think this was an 
unreasonable solution (i.e. they must have done it for the same reason, 
since there are comments specifically about including compiler.h for 
"__user").
