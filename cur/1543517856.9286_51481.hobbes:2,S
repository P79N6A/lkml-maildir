Actually, this does bring up another problem for me - because I don't have
time to follow the USB mailing lists, I've several times not been able to
make any judgement at all about some of the USB patches I've received. 
For example, judging from reactions I probably made the wrong call on not
including the HID parse code, simply because I hadn't followed the
discussion.
The problem for me is that I obviously cannot just apply every patch I
see. Usually lack of any good way to judge patches results in me being
more conservative than I have to be, which in turn just results in people
being irritated at me being unresponsive.
Is anybody willing to step up to the plate in the form of a "General USB
maintainer", the same way Alan Cox maintains all sound drivers as far as
I'm concerned (he obviously doesn't, but he acts as a "collector of
patches" and as a judge)? It obviously needs to be somebody who gets along
with people, and also somebody who can say NO! when required - not just
gathering things up.
And it needs to be somebody wo knows USB and reasonably actively does
participate in the discussion, and somebody who is reasonably neutral wrt
the different projects. Randy Dunlap comes to mind, but what do I know?
With a "maintainer", I would know that the patches are filtered and have
been discussed or judged on the USB lists, and I wouldn't end up
dismissing patches just because I don't know all the issues...
Comments? Anybody?
