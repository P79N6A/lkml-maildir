The problem with ISA is that it is too simple of a bus, and is virtually
transparent.  It has no auto-configuration/detection standard (except
ISAPNP).  Each card is detected in a different way, and you have the
problem with probing unknown ports causing potential crashes.  Detecting
the ISA slots is impossible, except possibly from the BIOS.
