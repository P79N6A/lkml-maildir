Subject: possible bug with adaptec aic-7896 and 2.4.x

in 2.4.0 and 2.4.1 on a pentium 3 with an onboard adaptec AIC-7896, i 
receive the following after it is detected:
scsi: aborting command due to timeout: pid 0, scsi0, channel 0, id 0
lun 0 Inquiry 00 00 00 ff 00
i get the error twice, then the box hangs. this occurs on both a single 
processor box and a dual processor box with a kernel without SMP support. 
on a dual processor box when SMP is compiled in, i receive a similar error:
scsi: aborting command due to timeout: pid 0, scsi0, channel 0, id 1 
lun 1 Inquiry 20 00 00 ff 00
but the box continues to boot fine.
the same hardware configuration in 2.2.15 works fine, and a similar hardware
configuration using a AIC-7895 instead of a AIC-7896 running 2.4.x works
fine.
any ideas?
thanks,
a
