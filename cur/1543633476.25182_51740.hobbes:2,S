Without trying to degrade this into an editor troll,
those emacsisms solve 1 thing only. They allow other
emacs users to see the code as it should be.
Unfortunatly, they do bugger all in other editors,
or in tools such as diff, which leads to some
wierd looking patches at times.
sidenote: I've lost count how many times I've found
trivial bugs just by changing the indentation[*] and spotting
misplaced brackets.

[*] To that that matches CodingStyle.
