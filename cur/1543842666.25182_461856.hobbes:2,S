Hi!
I have a ServerWorks CSB6 IDE controller, and with kernel 2.6.18-rc6 it is 
detected as OSB4. I think this happens because the driver_data in the 
pci_device_id table is zero for every device that uses the ServerWorks 
driver.
Please take a look at commit f201f5046ddaeeccb036bdf6848549bf5cb51bb1.
This commit introduced the usage of the PCI_DEVICE macro, but this macro 
does not set class and class_mask so I think now we set .class instead of 
.driver_data. The drivers that are also affected by this commit may 
have similar problems.
Marton
