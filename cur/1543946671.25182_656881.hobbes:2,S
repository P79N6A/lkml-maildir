Yes, there is the Next/merge.log file in linux-next.
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/sfr/linux-next.git;a=blob;f=Next/merge.log;hb=HEAD
This is also now documented on the pages i setup on
http://linux.f-seidel.de/linux-next/
while this
http://linux.f-seidel.de/linux-next/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Linux-next.ShortSummary
holds most of it in a short form.
