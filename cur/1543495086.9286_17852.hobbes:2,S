That's only half the story.  Ext2 doesn't store the high 16-bit of the UID
and GID in the disk inode.  In some cases of braindead software this may
even result in very hideous problems since both are equivalent modulo 65536,
that is for example UIDs 0, 65536 and 131072 are equivalent.  Security fun
ahead.
