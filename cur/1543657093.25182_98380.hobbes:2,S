This sounds like a possibility.  However, I cannot find any discussion
about what hardware the nforce2 chipset is similar to.  I just need to
know if the agp portion of the chipset is similar to something else. 
Can anybody point to that information?  From what I can determine the
device that is used is the host bridge.
