  Hi Adrian, Nathan and all,
 If think I might have hit this one! 
I managed to get an oops which showed xfs related functions on the backtrace. 
The process involved was "rm" and the specific stress test was some 32 
paralell kernel builds (each one with "make -j8") on a quad Opteron box with 
a 1 TB xfs filesystem. Preemption was disabled.
 After that the machine was still alive, but an fsck.xfs after a reboot showed 
corruption that I was able to repair with xfs_repair. This was also with an 
almost empty filesystem, hence the similarity with the above bug report.
 This was sometime ago, using the git tree from February 23 and unfortunately 
I didn't record the oops and output from xfs_repair. I'll update my git tree 
tonight, rebuild and retest in hopes to find that oops again. FWIW I managed 
to hit this after some 4 to 6 hours of testing so it shouldn't take too long 
to report back.
 See you later...
Best regards
Claudio Martins
