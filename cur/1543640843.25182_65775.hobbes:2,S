Linux version 2.4.20pre4. But it seems to be happen on all versions as
well.
gcc-3.2, glibc-2.2.5 (compiled with gcc-3.2)
Using loadlin with initrd specifying different ramdisk_size (eg. 23000,
28000, ...)
initrd=ramc1.gz (created by "gzip -9")
Linux will fail to boot failing at ...
RAMDISK: Compressed image found at block 0
invalid compressed format (err=2)<6>Freeing initrd memory: 8162k freed
Does this mean the kernel can't recognized imaged compressed under
gcc-3.2?
Thanks,
Jeff
