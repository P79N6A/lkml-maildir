i cannot find Thomas' recent 2.6 one (Thomas, do you have a link to 
it?), but i did one 5 years ago:
 
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/irq-rewrite-patches/irq-cleanup-2.4.15-B1.bz2
in general it's a large but otherwise pretty dumb patch.

yeah - but unless you can suggest some low-maintainance-overhead 
solution, not much can be done i suspect: being a few cycles slower is a 
lot less of a problem than being less flexible in the design. In general 
CPUs do optimize this quite well, but it is true that not every CPU 
does.

indirect pointers are very common both in OSs and in applications, 
especially in C++ based ones, where lots of execution goes off dynamic 
objects which have function pointers associated to them. So _lots_ of 
effort goes into branch prediction on the hardware side - and yes, 
modern CPUs do quite well with indirect pointers too.
The worst-case scenario is when the indirect branch flip-flops between 
multiple destination addresses - but that shouldnt be an issue for 
genirq because most systems have _one_ preferred way of handling 
interrupts that the majority of interrupt traffic uses. (for example on 
i686 it's level-triggered PCI irqs)
But even if there's multiple destinations from the indirect jump, newest 
CPUs (such as Core 2) can actually store _multiple_ branch history 
targets and can prefetch all of them at once (if there's idle capacity 
left).
(And i wouldnt be surprised if some modern CPUs already stored the 
indirection register's index in the BHT, and used that for the 
prediction. Most indirect calls happen off registers, and if the 
compiler loads the register early enough (which it typically does) then 
the branch target value is available to the CPU. Other context 
information can be included in a BHT too.)
Also, in general, if something is arguably a smart thing to do in an OS 
(and more design flexibility via function pointers is a smart thing for 
which there is no viable alternative), we can expect CPUs to get 
gradually better at handling them.

ah, ok. For PREEMPT_HARDIRQS we thought about possibly utilizing 
hw-level IRQ prioritization too - but it's quite inflexible in most IRQ 
controller designs: the prioritization is rarely integrated with the CPU 
and is often attached to the ACK/EOI-ing of the IRQ line (and an 
unACK-ed IRQ can have side-effects).
So the thing we chose for PREEMPT_HARDIRQS was to do the prioritization 
at the OS/scheduler level. And OS level handling of this is what we need 
anyway: IRQ handlers are just the first, often tiny portion in a 
critical workload that a system must perform. (we have softirqs, 
signals, tasks, etc.) Nevertheless the door is open to utilize hw 
capabilities of IRQ prioritization - we 'only' need standard driver and 
/sys APIs to make use of them.
