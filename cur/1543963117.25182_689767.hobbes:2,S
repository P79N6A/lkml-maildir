Funny you should mention it; locks.c uses cond_resched() assuming that
it ignores the BKL.  Not through needing to avoid livelock, but it does
presume that other higher priority tasks contending for the lock will
get a chance to take it.  You'll notice the patch I posted yesterday
drops the file_lock_lock around the call to cond_resched().
