Subject: [PATCH 00/17] [MIPS] Malta: massive code cleanup

Ralf,
This is the Malta cleanup, which I was talking about some time ago.
The patches should be fairly obvious. They make no functional
changes.
Build tests passed successfully when I used the default configs
for Atlas, Malta and SEAD.
Just in case, I also ran boot tests, which passed successfully with
the default Malta config and a Qemu-emulated Malta board in both BE
and LE modes.
The net effect is that the number of errors, warnings, and checks
reported by checkpatch.pl changes as follows:
Before:
--------------------------------------------
              | errors | warnings | checks 
--------------------------------------------
malta_int.c   |  47    |    20    |    1   
--------------------------------------------
malta_setup.c |  3     |    21    |    3
--------------------------------------------
malta_smtc.c  |  2     |    0     |    0
--------------------------------------------
After:
--------------------------------------------
              | errors | warnings | checks 
--------------------------------------------
malta_int.c   |  0     |    0     |    0   
--------------------------------------------
malta_setup.c |  0     |    0     |    0
--------------------------------------------
malta_smtc.c  |  0     |    0     |    0
--------------------------------------------
The last patch in the series removes a very obsolete and misleading
document from Documentation/mips.
Please consider.
Thanks,
Dmitri
