Hi,
I am running linux-2.4.3 on a Dell dual PIII machine with 128M memory.
After the machine runs a while, dmesg shows,
__alloc_pages: 4-order allocation failed.
__alloc_pages: 3-order allocation failed.
__alloc_pages: 4-order allocation failed.
__alloc_pages: 4-order allocation failed.
__alloc_pages: 4-order allocation failed.
__alloc_pages: 4-order allocation failed.
and sometime the system will crash. I looked into the memory info,
there still has some free physical memory (20M) left and swap space is
almost not in use. (250M swap)
I didn't have this problem when I ran 2.4.0 (I even didn't see it on
2.4.2) could anybody tell me what's wrong or where should I look into this
problem?
Thanks,
Alex
