Yeah, but maybe Andrew isn't even talking about those boards.  I know
when I worked for Lockheed, they had a bunch of custom boards that were
for one specific project.  There would really be no point in pushing a
driver into the mainline that is used by one board for one project.
But then again, I'm not Andrew, and maybe he _is_ talking about the
drivers used by only four boards.
