Hi!
I read that 2.2.6 introduced changes to scripts/ver_linux.
However, before 2.2.6, IIRC, it showed the right versions
of the C++ libraries here, but now it is broken. It looks
this way:
Linux C++ Library      27..
Linux C++ Library      2.8.1
I've got the following "libstdc++"es in /usr/lib:
  shared: 2.8.1, 2.9.0, 27.2.1
  static: 2.9.0
