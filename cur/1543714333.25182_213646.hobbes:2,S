Which is less that 2% of the space which is used by the 100k inodes.
We've previously discussed allocating the idr pointer array separately, but
the extra cache miss for the users who need it, plus the 2% argument keep
on trumping that.  (We could avoid the cache miss with zero-length-array
tricks, actually).

Your current requirement does not appear to justify this additional
infrastructure.
