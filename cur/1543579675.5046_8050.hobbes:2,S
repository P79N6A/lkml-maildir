Lets get a few points clear..  Are we talking - you already had
both linux and WinXX installed, and rebooted from Linux into the
existing Windows setup, and next time you booted Windows Linux
was fried?
Sounds like you might have a partitioning problem where Windows
sees the disk geometry one way, and perhaps Linux sees it
differently.
I can't see at all how Windows could end up putting data on ext2
volumes though without read-write ext2 support in Windows.  Are
you running the freely available ext2 fs driver in Windows?
