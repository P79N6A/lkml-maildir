I thought the current implementation was that when creating a
directory, ext2fs searches forward from the block group the parent
directory is in, looking for a "relatively free" block group. So, a
number of successive calls to mkdir(2) with the same parent directory
will result in the child directories being in the same block group.
So, creating the directory tree by creating directories in the base
directory and then shuffling should result in the directories be
spread out over a modest number of block groups, rather than a large
number.
Addendum to my scheme: leaf nodes should be created in their
directories, not in the base directory. IOW, it's only directories
that should use this trick.
Am I wrong in my understanding of the current algorithm?
