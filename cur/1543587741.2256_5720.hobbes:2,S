Hello, I had a mystery with my Linux running 2.4.2 kernel with ARP packet
response.
I have two interfaces that share same subnet, I call eth0 194.29.192.37
and eth1 194.29.192.38. I have forwarding turned on, proxy arp is not
neighter are redirects.
When I flush local neighbor table in other machine I use to observe the
response and ping the router I get response like:
23:38:25.278848 > arp who-has 194.29.192.38 tell 194.29.192.10 (0:50:da:82:ae:9f)
23:38:25.278988 < arp reply 194.29.192.38 is-at 0:1:2:dc:d2:64 (0:50:da:82:ae:9f)
23:38:25.279009 < arp reply 194.29.192.38 is-at 0:1:2:dc:d2:6c (0:50:da:82:ae:9f)
The second one is the valid one, but both interfaces seem to answer to the
broadcasted packet with their own ARP addresses.
This came up when I wondered why I get responses to wrong interface with
Zebra.
