The verbiage in these entries seems 'make config' / text-interaction
-centric.  Granted, that's likely the context most kernel builders will
use, but it would seem fair to at least consider a broader audience
who may be using more gui-ish tools wrapped around extant content.
For instance, a click-a-node-to-choose-an-option-gui or click-a-box-to
-choose-an-option-set-and-optionally-drill-down-to-details-gui would
probably (when asked) present the Configure.help entry for a given
option, but the  "If you say Y here ... If unsure say Y"  wording would
not be apropos in such a presentation context.  
Something akin to "Select this option to enable classification of egress
traffic based on ..." might serve differing presentation modes more
adequately.
