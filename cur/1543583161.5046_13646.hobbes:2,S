Yes, but they happen a few hours after the system starts up and continue
until the server is restarted.  It seems like a separate issue.  I haven't
tried taking down the interface and putting it back up since the interface
never dies link others have reported with their NICs.  The NIC continues to
work fine, though the logs get flooded with those messages.

That's a negative.

I'll compile 2.4.2-ac5 and we'll see in another 5 days if this happens
again.  Till then, any suggestions on what to look for/at and/or what to do
when it happens will help.
Thanks!

Sounds like a network driver problem.
Are you still getting the "hordes" of Tx timeouts with the
3c905B which you reported a week ago?
If so, do they only start coming out when the slowdown occurs?
You are probably a victim of the APIC bug.  A
workaround for this is present in 2.4.2-ac5.  Alternatively,
boot the kernel with the `noapic' LILO option.
Please let us know the outcome.
