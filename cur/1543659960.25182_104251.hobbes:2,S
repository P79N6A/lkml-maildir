I shot for the one liner that fixed the case I could test. Shoving it
into subarch is cleaner, but needs more code movement and changes the
prior semantics. The prior semantics were broken for larger Summit
configurations, hmm. Maybe _all_ the array sizes should go into some
kind of subarch analogue of param.h, e.g. mach_param.h
The only one I can think of that doesn't fly is NR_IRQS; once there
are more interrupt sources than FIRST_SYSTEM_VECTOR - FIRST_DEVICE_VECTOR
the whole of arch/i386/ appears to explode.
Someone somewhere should probably take notice of that.
