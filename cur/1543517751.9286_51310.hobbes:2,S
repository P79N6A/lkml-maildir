SGI has developed almost all the things you mentioned, kernel tracing,
debugging, powerful crash analysis tools, as well as other things like
kernel lock metering and kernel profiling. Patches for all of them can
be downloaded from our open source web site 
http://oss.sgi.com/projects
 
along with many other open source technologies from SGI.
Simon.
