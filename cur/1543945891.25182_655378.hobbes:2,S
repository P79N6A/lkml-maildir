Interesting that you have CONFIG_FAIR_USER_SCHED. Do you have any other users on
the system (are they running anything at the time of the benchmark)? Could you
turn off CONFIG_FAIR_USER_SCHED  and turn on CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED. I am going
to run some tests with 2.6.25-rc2 and Volanomark and see how that goes.
