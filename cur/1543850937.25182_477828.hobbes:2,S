Thanks, I understand it.
But I noticed that even if we have this kind of smp-safe code, there
is no guarantee that 2nd auth_domain_put() in
svcauth_gss_unregister_pseudoflavor() is the last reference of
this gss_domain.
So it is possible to happen invalid dereference by real last user of
this gss_domain after unloading module. If this is not wrong,
Is it neccesary to have try_get_module()/put_module() somewhere to
prevent this?
