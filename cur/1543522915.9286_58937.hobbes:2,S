didn't Larry McVoy make a point a while back (which relates well to
the IBM paper), that if your application depends on huge numbers of
threads, you're always going to keep bumping up against the scheduler?
a lot of people throw lots of threads at a problem and it can really
be bad design.
in the vast majority of cases, i suspect it's easier and probably
better to redesign the app than redesign the scheduler.  that said,
the improvements already done are quite good and needed.
