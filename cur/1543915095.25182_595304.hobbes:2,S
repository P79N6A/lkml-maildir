Then it's just a version ID.  You pretty much have to treat it as a 
version id because if it returns 0x4000 0003 and you only know what 0002 
is, then you can't actually use it.
I much prefer the current use of CPUID in KVM.  If 1000 returns the KVM 
signature, then 1001 *must* be valid and contain a set of feature bits.  
If we wish to use additional CPUID leaves in the future, then we can 
just use a feature bit.  The real benefit to us is that we can use a 
discontiguous set of leaves whereas the Xen approach is forced to use a 
linear set (at least for the result to be meaningful).

Why do 0000-1000 have to be valid?  Xen is not going to change what they 
have today--they can't.  However, if down the road, they decided that 
since so many guests use KVM's paravirtualization interface other than 
Linux, there's value in supporting it, by using 1000, they can.

I'm starting to lean toward just using 0000.  If for no other reason 
than the hypercall space is unsharable.
