I think any neutral observer would agree that you are damaging your cause
and losing credibility.  Perhaps I can't be objective enough to make that
call, but it sure seems obvious.
Leaders lead by letting others succeed, you are trying to hijack other's
work and claim for your own.  That's not leadership, that's browbeating.
Oh, and by the way, have you fixed the name of your kernel?  Are the
web pages updated to note its true name: Linux/Hurd?  It would be great
if you could take care of that if you haven't already.
