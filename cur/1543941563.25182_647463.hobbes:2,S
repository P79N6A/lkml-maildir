btw. does this program hang for anyone on 2.6.22 (process in D state) ?
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sched.h>
int main( void )
{
        cpu_set_t cpu;
        int cpus = 0;
        int ret;
        ret = sched_getaffinity(getpid(), sizeof(cpu), &cpu);
        printf( "cpus = %d, ret = %d\n", cpu, ret );
        sched_setaffinity(getpid(), sizeof(cpu), &cpu);
        printf( "ret = %d\n" );
        return ret;
}
