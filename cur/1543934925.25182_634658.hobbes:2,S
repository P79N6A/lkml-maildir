I have only seen that one once, and I think it was Arjan who said
that it has been observed rarely by other people as well.
The bugzilla entry is mostly just to track the darned thing,
but it seems unlikely that anyone will find/fix it for 2.6.24.
No big deal, but it would be good to have somebody knowledgeable
in clocks/interrupts try and track it down.
I wonder if it's just a babbling IRQ on resume, before the driver
has run it's resume code or something ?
Cheers
