As you're hacking Configure anyway, what about "fixing"
	dep_tristate ' ..' CONFIG_FOO $CONFIG_BAR,
which doesn't work as expected when CONFIG_BAR is not set (as opposed to 
"n"), to consider an unset CONFIG_BAR equivalent to "n" in this case?
(The rather hacky way I'd imagine to do so is to look at all used 
$CONFIG_* in a Config.in file before sourcing it and setting them to "n")
