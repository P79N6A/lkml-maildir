That tradeoff makes the case for spt being a kbuild or /proc/sys option. A
linear speedup of fork/exec/exit is likely to be more generally useful,
most people just don't have huge shared areas. On the other hand, those
who do would get a vast improvement, and that would put Linux a major step
forward in the server competition.

I'm just trying to decide what this might do for a news server with
hundreds of readers mmap()ing a GB history file. Benchmarks show the 2.5
has more latency the 2.4, and this is likely to make that more obvious.
Is there any way to to have this only on processes which really need it?
define that any way you wish, including hanging a capability on the
executable to get spt.
