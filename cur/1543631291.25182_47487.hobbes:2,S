Shouldn't that be "Marcelo is not applying them"?  Linus has devolved
all responsibility for 2.4 now, and is concentrating on the 2.5 series
and all its radical changes.
Marcelo objected to Andrea's mega-patch, but if I recall, he hinted that
me might start merging the split-up patches for 2.4.20 - in the
meantime, you can always apply the latest -aa patch yourself to a
2.4.19-pre kernel. Otherwise, the Red Hat patched kernel (which I
believe still doesn't use Andrea's VM at all) ought to work well, with
all their spiffy regression testing etc....
Cheers
