OK...  Then the idea is to dynamically redirect the symbolic link
to include/linux-srt or include/linux-srt that you mentioned in your
previous email, or is the symlink serving some other purpose?

So your focus is on system calls that can have totally separate
realtime and non-realtime implementations?  Or am I missing some
trick here?

Single kernel, multiple implementations for some syscalls, more
or less, anyway.

My guess is that there are enough people in the PREEMPT_RT camp that
it might not make sense to ascribe a single point of view to them  ;-)
How are you and Kristian looking to benchmark/compare the various
combinations you call out above?  Seems like one would have to look
at more than straight scheduling/interrupt latency to make a reasonable
comparison.
						Thanx, Paul
