You stop it and force it to execute rlimit(2) in its context, of
course! What could be simpler? 
The reason we never see questions about this is because relatively few
people are using limits. Instead we see weekly questions about fork
bombs.
Frankly, I'd rather see new syscalls to get and set limits on other
processes in the same way we can set priorities, affinities, etc.. But
there are a couple dragons lurking there..
