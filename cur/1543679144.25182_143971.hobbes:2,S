But, unless the locks are overlapping (which they did not used to be) there
really is nothing to analyze in the first place...it's just obviously
correct, right?

That's not an unreasonable thing to do...it'd be a much more minor change.
I guess I'm just having a hard time seeing the benefit of rearranging
all this code. Unless there's some substantial benefit, it seems wiser
to keep the changes as minimal as possible...after all, the current code
does work.

I'm in favor of doing the minor change in the driver to maintain
compatibility with existing userland tools. It's a pretty simple fix...
The patch will be coming shortly...
