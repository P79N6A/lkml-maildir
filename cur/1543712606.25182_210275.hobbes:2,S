Well, the entire patch should be applied. Nothing wrong with it.
That will enable people to use (0x0c0b,0xa109) to read CF,
or to read SM, but not both. (Without the patch the device
does not work at all.)
The situation is precisely the same as that for (0x07c4,0xa109).
To do something better we need infrastructure that does not exist today,
at least not in the vanilla kernel. That is why I call for discussion.
The points are ordinary use and error recovery.
For ordinary use the main point seems to be the us->extra
pointer to private data. Since each driver needs private data,
a single pointer does not suffice.
