Subject: lowlatency-2.2.14-B1 + 2.2.14aa7 fixes crash, but...

The lowlatency-2.2.14-B1 patch applied to Andrea's 2.2.14aa7 kernel
no longer crashes on disk I/O during the rtc_latency test.
However, latency has increased to 1.4msec as reported by the tests.
This may be due to the fact that the patch does not apply cleanly
and my quick fixes were not complete.
Also, after 3 successful runs of rtc_latency, the test hung in the 
do_rtc_latency script while executing a sync command, the sync command
stayed in the "D" state ( uninterruptible sleep - IO).  Any ideas?
