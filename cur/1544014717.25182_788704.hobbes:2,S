This was a noname 4 GByte SDHC card. If you write a continious stream of data 
at max. speed, the card generates a BUSY signal every 10 seconds for nearly a 
whole second.

I strongly disagree with you.
While each and every SD card should conform to the standard, a driver for a 
host controller should be as forgiving as possible. If the driver cannot cope 
with cards sold today, the user has a bad experience.
I code drivers for people and not for standards.
Remember, this is only a timeout. Lengthen the timeout will have no 
consequences for cards which behave.
best regards
