I think I know what you mean. IRIX does this AFAIK, and it sucks.
Users log in at one security level. The whole X server runs at
this one level. If you need to operate at two levels, you have
to log out and log back in again at another level.
This is totally user-hostile, so it won't be used very much.
The X server and window manager must be trusted software.
This is what Trusted Solaris claims to do. Windows get marked
with security data. Cut-and-paste is controlled.
