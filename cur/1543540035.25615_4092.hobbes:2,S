I had the same problem using a zImage and I have now switched to a
bzImage version of the kernel. So far, I had not used the bzImage
version because I was unable to boot it with LILO. I have switched to
GRUB and I can successfully boot version 2.4.0-test4. You are using a
zImage, aren't you?
I think you should:
1. build a bzImage version,
2. install GRUB on a floppy
3. try to boot that version using GRUB.
I hope this is of some help,
Chris
