Hi Jeff, all,
Sorry for the dealy but i've been out of the country.
Anyhow i did some investigation and i've figured out the bug.
Essentially if you try to compile a UML kernel on a 2.6.18.1 or above 
*host* kernel it will fail with the error messages shown (essentially 
offsetof macro undefined) because between 2.6.18 and 2.6.18.1 that macro 
in /usr/include/linux/stddef.h is now wrapped in a #ifdef __KERNEL__ . 
However since UML doesn't build it's sources with that defined we get an 
undefined macro and a build failure.
So i'm partly right and partly wrong in my statement below. Yes i did 
compile a guest UML kernel 2.6.18 fine on host kernel of 2.6.18, and i 
believe i will be able to compile 2.6.18.1 and above also on a host 
kernel of 2.6.18 but if i change my host kernel to 2.6.18.1 or above all 
UML guest builds will fail.
Can someone confirm they can build guest UML kernels on a host kernel >= 
2.6.18.1 ??
Thanks
M

You're sure about that?  I just looked through the 2.6.18.1 changelog and
I see nothing that would cause this.

I would do a -E build and make sure that this header, or another one that
defines offsetof is getting pulled in.
