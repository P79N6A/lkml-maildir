Here is 3 patches to address the following:
    01-fix-x86.git-need
	- fixes up things missing in x86.git  [necessary]
    02-fix-x86.git-debug-maxsmp
	- adds debug options [do not include, except for DEBUG]
    03-fix-x86.git-non-x86-changes
	- non-x86 changes that should fix build errors when x86.git
	  is merged into -mm.  [necessary for -mm merge]
	  [percpu_modcopy() being the primary problem but also the
	  config option name for "HAVE_PER_CPU_SETUP" is different.]
