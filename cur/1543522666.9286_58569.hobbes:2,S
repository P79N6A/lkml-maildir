SGI for one
Sun E10K compilers for another
Cray SV1 for a third (I also tested a "unsigned short", which didn't work
	on the SV1 - sizeof(unsigned short) was 8 bytes and the assignment
	masked off the high order bits...)
Cray T3E for a fourth (although it did say an "unsigned short" was 8 bytes
	too, and did work - the actual storage for unsigned short was
	64 bits - the assignment did not mask off the high order bits...)
	The CPU for T3 is 450Mhz Alpha chips.
It does point out some of the data size portability problems though.
I did modify the program slightly:
#define INT_TYPE        unsigned short
#define BITS (sizeof(INT_TYPE)*8-1)
int main()
{
   INT_TYPE xxx = 1;
   printf("bits=%d\n",BITS);
   printf("%08x (%d)\n", xxx, xxx);
   xxx <<= BITS;
   printf("%08x (%d)\n", xxx, xxx);
   xxx >>= BITS;
   printf("%08x (%d)\n", xxx, xxx);
   return 0;
}
Just to see what the differences would be.
Intel Pentium (Linux 2.0.33)
	bits=15
	00000001 (1)
	00008000 (32768)
	00000001 (1)
SGI (Irix 6.5.3)
	bits=15
	00000001 (1)
	00008000 (32768)
	00000001 (1)
Sun E10K (Solaris 2.7)
	bits=15
	00000001 (1)
	00008000 (32768)
	00000001 (1)
Cray SV1
	bits=63			---- (surprise...)
	00000001 (1)
	00000000 (0)		---- correct results given 63 bit shift
	00000000 (0)		---- of a 16 bit value
Cray T3E
	bits=31			---- small surprise
	00000001 (1)
	80000000 (2147483648)   ---- surprise - incorrect results given 63 bit
	00000001 (1)		---- shift of 16 bit value
