No.
Notice that "kdev_t" implies that all devices have the same kind of
pointer.
"struct block_device" implies that, for example, character devices are of
a completely different type. 
Also, the difference is in reference counting. The current setup assumes
that you never have to "put" a reference to kdev_t, which is just broken
in a dynamic environment - we do NOT want to be required to hold on to
"struct block_device" data structures forever, we need to also clean them
up after they are no longer referenced by anybody.
It's more of an evolution of kdev_t, and I agree with you 100% in that
sense.
