Here is the patch

These are just EXPORT_SYMBOL -> EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL and #include fixes.

Yes, that's on the plan too, but in some cases (like braille devices),
the driver needs to read from the port too, which is not provided by
early consoles.

I don't know exactly, but most probably yes, because else the cursor
position gets wrong.

OK.  Having my patches in the -mm tree for just some review time is
fine: at least we know that the way they're done is ok for people (or
else we're told how to fix them).

It is happening.

Oh, great!  Maybe Kirk should be contacted so he gives access to the git
tree of speakup.
