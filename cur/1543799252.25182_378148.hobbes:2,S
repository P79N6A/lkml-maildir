Hi,
Since several kernel-versions now the asus_acpi module is broken on several 
Samsung notebooks, it causes an oops when loading and a kernelpanic when 
compiled into the kernel.
This is known for ages. There was a patch by Karol Kozimor shortly after the 
bug became public that was ignored.
The code was changed so the patch failed. Christian Aichinger again made a 
patch. It was ignored as well.
Now, finally the patch is in the mm-source, I asked Andrew Morton to push it 
to Linus so 2.6.15 will be fixed, Andrew said this is up to Len Brown. No 
Reply from him.
Now it seems that 2.6.15 is going to be released soon, the patch still has not 
made it into linus tree.
This is not "some minor issue", this completely breaks the usage of current 
vanilla-kernels on certain Hardware. Can please, please, please anyone in the 
position to do this take care that this patch get's accepted before 2.6.15?
The patch is available inside mm-sources or here:
http://www.int21.de/samsung/p30-2.6.14.diff
If I should send it to anyone else or if there's anything I can do to help 
fixing this, I'm glad to help.
cu,
