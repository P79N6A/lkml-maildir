Hi,
booting newest 2.6.9 experimental kernels, I frequently encountered 
"Uncompressing Linux... Out of memory --System halted"
In some mail archive I found the (obvious ;-) solution: Increase HEAP_SIZE.
Here in line 122 of arch/i386/boot/compressed/misc.c this
	#define HEAP_SIZE             0x4000
instead of 
	#define HEAP_SIZE             0x3000
made 2.6.9-mm1-RT-U10.3 boot again.
0x3400 or 03800 might also do it, haven't checked.
Best,
Karsten
