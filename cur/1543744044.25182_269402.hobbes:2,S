No, I am using (no headers):
-------------------
extern int sprintf(char *, const char *,...);
extern int puts(const char *);
static const char hello[]="Hello";
int xxx(void);
int xxx(){
    char buf[0x100];
    sprintf(buf, "%s", hello);
    puts(buf);
    return 0;
}
--------------------
Compiled as:
gcc -O2 -Wall -S -o xxx xxx.c
I get:
 	.file	"xxx.c"
 	.section	.rodata
 	.type	hello, @object
 	.size	hello, 6
hello:
 	.string	"Hello"
 	.text
 	.p2align 2,,3
.globl xxx
 	.type	xxx, @function
xxx:
 	pushl	%ebp
 	movl	%esp, %ebp
 	pushl	%ebx
 	subl	$268, %esp
 	pushl	$hello
 	leal	-264(%ebp), %ebx
 	pushl	%ebx
 	call	strcpy
 	movl	%ebx, (%esp)
 	call	puts
 	xorl	%eax, %eax
 	movl	-4(%ebp), %ebx
 	leave
 	ret
 	.size	xxx, .-xxx
 	.section	.note.GNU-stack,"",@progbits
 	.ident	"GCC: (GNU) 3.3.3 20040412 (Red Hat Linux 3.3.3-7)"
If I don't use -O2, I get the sprintf() call. If I use
the constant string "Hello" instead of the allocated string,
it just bypasses everything and calls puts() directly.
If I use -fno-builtin, then it doesn't bypass sprintf().
However, there is no ISO C standard of "built-in" so
I don't think any compiler should default to something
that is undefined and decide to do whatever its current
whims are. Certainly, a compiler that has some capabilities,
not defined by a standard, should be able to use those
capabilities, but it certainly shouldn't decide to do
these things on its own.
Reviewing `man gcc` I see where I should be able to
find out what the built-in commands are:
 	gcc -dumpspecs
However, this man page is wrong because I don't get a
listing of any built-in functions, only the linking
and compiler defaults.
The compiler is a tool. It should be just like other
tools. Any killer options should be something that
take a special effort to turn ON. It shouldn't default
to firing the bullet out both ends of the barrel!
Cheers,
