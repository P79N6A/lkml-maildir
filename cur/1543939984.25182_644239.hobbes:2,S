We're talking about changing 0-100 to 0-something sane, because the 
current driver is quite clearly broken. And yes, I'm perfectly happy to 
say that - the reason that max_brightness is exported is to allow 
userspace to determine what range of values is acceptable, and if 
userspace ignores that then things are going to break for it at some 
point.
