True, but a system that disables proc is likely a system with a custom
policy anyway, and dependency on proc is fairly basic to selinux these
days (due to reliance on /proc/self/attr for process attribute
manipulation in place of the old selinux syscalls).  Possibly we should
just make selinux depend on proc and drop the #ifdef there.

At present, we map the sysctls into functional groups (e.g. net, vm,
fs, ...) that parallel the sysctl hierarchy so that we can limit access
to only those programs/processes that need access for their purpose, and
further partition where it makes sense to do so.  We also separate out
particularly security sensitive ones like modprobe and hotplug.  So if
the ctl_table carried some indication of functional grouping and
security relevance (for some relatively small number of equivalence
classes), then we could map those to labels instead of the current
scheme.  And if we could have the ctl_table inherit the information from
its logical "parent" in the hierarchy by default, then it shouldn't
require too invasive a patch.
