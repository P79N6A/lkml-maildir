XFS does dynamic inode allocation, there is no preallocated set.
Steve also recently implemented dynamic space reclaim for ondisk
inode clusters too, once they're no longer used.  XFS puts a cap
on the amount of space that can be used for inodes at mkfs time
(25% iirc), and this can be adjusted later via "xfs_growfs -m".
I don't know enough about the other filesystems to answer for them
though.
cheers.
