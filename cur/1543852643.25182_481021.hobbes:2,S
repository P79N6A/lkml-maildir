This may be related but I doubt it.  Something is strange about how
memory is being mapped in your system.  whatever is creating the
problem moved when you changed the kernel version.  I'm wondering if
there is a device collision at e5302000.  I'm not convinced at this
point it is e100's fault.
can you send output of cat /proc/iomem

okay when the driver loads it is clearing PME enable, but not
re-enabling it when it unloads.  That is pretty much expected.

pci_enable_device should be enabling io,mem,busmaster, they are
probably being disabled when the driver errors out of init.  maybe you
should add a call to  pci_set_power_state(dev, PCI_D0); before the
call to e100_reset

now that is really odd.

There isn't one, MAbort+ would be showing in the above lspci output.
The all 0xffffffff returns when you read registers is a sure sign the
hardware either isn't at the address specified or is in a power down
state.  The only other option i can think of is that something else is
intercepting memory reads and writes.
try something like the attached patch, compile tested only:
[unhandled content-type:application/octet-stream]
