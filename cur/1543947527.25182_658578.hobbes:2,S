What I don't understand is why the slab allocators have something like
this in it:
        if ((flags & SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN) &&
                        size > cache_line_size() / 2)
                return max_t(unsigned long, align, cache_line_size());
If you ask for HWCACHE_ALIGN, then you should get it. I don't
understand, why do they think they knows better than the caller?
Things like this are just going to lead to very difficult to track
performance problems. Possibly correctness problems in rare cases.
There could be another flag for "maybe align".
