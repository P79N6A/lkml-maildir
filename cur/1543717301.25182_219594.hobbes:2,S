Another way would be to have a ./linux/patches/ directory and ask every
patch to place a file down there. Then, just list all the file names
with their contents in /proc/patches.gz ...
Of course, one could even place the actual patches there and display
everything in /proc/patches.gz that's not an actual patch chunk. This
way, you can have nice patches with proper documentation (think quilt
series) and even (another CONFIG_XXX option) the full patch file inside
the kernel! For custom built kernels, *this* would be a *real*
advantage! For vanilla kernel, you wouldn't loose anything.
