No, the CHECKER people themselves didn't find any bugs.  They wrote a clever
analyzer
that finds error patterns (actually, just patterns) and submitted them.  Some
false positives, but worse,
an uncountable number of false negatives and as-yet-unknown error patterns.
That's not "a lot of eyes", it's a few brains and a fast computer.  I'm not
saying that's a *bad* thing but I certainly don't think it's an example of
"lots of eyes".
