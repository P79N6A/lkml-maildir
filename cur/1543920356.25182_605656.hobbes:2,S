Hi Bernhard,
Shouldn't bootmem allocator have the functionality to flag an error if
we try to reserve a memory which is already reserved? I see that bootmem
allocator is currently printing a warning under CONFIG_DEBUG_BOOTMEM.
Wouldn't it be better if we reserve the code, data and bss memory also
using bootmem allocator and when somebody tries to reserve craskernel memory
and if there is an overlap, boot memory allocator should scream?
In second patch, you are checking for crash kernel reserved memory being
beyond _end. That will make sure that there is no overlap with kernel
text, data or bss. I am wondering then why do we need first patch and
why should we register bss memory in the resources list. Second patch 
would make sure that there is no overlap with crash kernel memory and kexec
will not place any segment outside crashkernel memory.
Thanks
Vivek
