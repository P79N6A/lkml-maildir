I see the same thing with an ASUS A7V133 motherboard that has a
PDC20265 installed on the motherboard. If I disable the PDC BIOS, the
system boots normally - but trying to use any UDMA mode hangs.
Ordinary mdma2 mode works fine. 
So I suspect that the real culprit is the UDMA mode which the BIOS
probably enables - when I boot the the BIOS disabled, the device shows
up as running in pio mode.
All in all, I haven't had much success with the PDC controllers - 
both cases I have tried will hang the system when enabling UDMA
(and there is no common hardware involved).
