+	printk(KERN_INFO "Building NUMA distance from ACPI 2.0 SLIT\n");
This printk just looks like noise during boot.  Surely this
is normal behavior on a NUMA system?
+	printk(KERN_INFO "No SLIT table, defaulting NUMA distance\n");
But this one deserves more prominence than just KERN_INFO.  I'd
say that it deserves a KERN_ERR rating (without accurate information
we'll make some highly questionable scheduling and memory placement
decisions).  On the other hand the only way for the end-user to fix
this is to complain to their system vendor to fix firmware.  So perhaps
it is just a KERN_NOTICE.
