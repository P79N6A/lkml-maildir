Oleg, if one thread can be in collect_signal() and another in 
sigqueue_free() and both operate on the exact same sigqueue object, its 
not clear how we prevent two calls to __sigqueue_free() to
the same object. In that case the lock (or some lock) should be around 
__sigqueue_free() - no ?
 i.e if we enter sigqueue_free(), we will call __sigqueue_free() 
regardless of the state.
