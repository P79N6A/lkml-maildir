Is IDE in 2.4.x and 2.5.x now more or less in sync?
I have some m68k (at least for Amiga builtin) IDE updates for 2.5.x, but am
still waiting for the other m68k platforms to send them in. But if 2.4.21 is
approaching very soon, I better hurry up backporting them to 2.4.x...

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
