It all depends what the USB device driver does. If it does
pass the struct device of it's controller, it's fine. If we
want it to be able to pass its own struct device, we need
this walk... it's a matter of how we want this API to behave.
Same goes for firewire, and possibly others
Anyway, a platform hook in device_add() seem like it could be
useful for other things as well...
Ben.
