It's come up a few times and the converation is always fairly similar 
although the thread 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/22/44
 has interesting 
information on the topic. There has been no serious discussion on whether 
anti-fragmentation would help it or not. I think it would if atomic 
allocations were clustered together because then jumbo frame allocations 
would cluster together in the same MAX_ORDER blocks and tend to keep other 
allocations away.
