Hi
I have a network driver (Ethernet), When i install the driver with insmod
the driver installs successfully
and with ifconfig -a i could see the ethernet driver name as eth0 or eth1
etc.
(net_device structure having variable name from where we will have
the name of the driver)
For ATM driver , it installs the driver without any problem.
but with ifconfig -a it doesn't show anything like the case in ethernet
driver.(i suppose it shows like atm0, atm1 or .. am i correct.??)B
How i can i get the driver name with "ifconfig -a" for PPPoATM driver.
Whats the function need to be included in the code to get the same..??
Kindly reply back to this mail ID and subbu2k_av@yahoo.com
Thanks in Advance
Subbu
