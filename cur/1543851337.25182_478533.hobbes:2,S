As I mentioned in my earlier mail, I thought openvz folks did want this
flexibility:
	
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/18/98
Also:
	
http://lwn.net/Articles/94573/
But I am ok if we dont support this feature in the initial round of
development.
Having grouping for different resources could be a hairy to deal
with and could easily mess up applications (for ex: a process in a 80%
CPU class but in a 10% memory class could lead to underutilization of
its cpu share, because it cannot allocated memory as fast as it wants to run), 
it is assumed that administrator will carefully manage these settings.

Isnt /proc/<pid> listed also in /proc/<pid>/task/<tid>?
For ex:
	# ls /proc/2906/task
	2906  2907  2908  2909
2906 is the main thread which created the remaining threads.
This would lead to an ambiguity when user does something like below:
	echo 2906 > /some_res_file_system/some_new_group
Is he intending to move just the main thread, 2906, to the new group or
all the threads? It could be either.
This needs some more thought ...
