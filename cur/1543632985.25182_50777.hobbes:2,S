With 2.5.19 tulip says the following for my 21143:
Linux Tulip driver version 1.1.13 (May 11, 2002)
PCI: Found IRQ 5 for device 02:0a.0
tulip0:  EEPROM default media type Autosense.
tulip0:  Index #0 - Media MII (#11) described by a 21142 MII PHY (3) block.
tulip0:  MII transceiver #1 config 3000 status 782d advertising 01e1.
eth0: Digital DS21143 Tulip rev 65 at 0xd800, 00:40:C7:99:3A:5B, IRQ 5.
But 2.5.20 tulip now spews the following and then misidentifies
the NIC as a 21140:
Linux Tulip driver version 1.1.13 (May 11, 2002)
PCI: Found IRQ 5 for device 02:0a.0
tulip0:  EEPROM default media type Autosense.
tulip0:  Index #0 - Media 100baseTx (#3) described by a 21140 non-MII (0) block.
tulip0:  Index #1 - Media 10baseT (#0) described by a 21140 non-MII (0) block.

Also note the obviously broken "eth%d" printk format string.
