Hi again,
Earlier today I wrote about my SMP and Ultra-DMA problem. Now have I
written
down the boot information. I hope that the attachment show the correct
information, it was written in W*rd so some lower case chars can have been
converted into upper case...
I also checked the IDE-patch and the filename was
kernel-patch-2.2.19-ide_20010325-1.tar.gz.
Could a newer IDE-patch handle SMP better than this one?
Thanks!
