Strange, so why do you have include/linux/videodev.h and look at it
with user space applications? Or what are you talking about?
I am talking about 
../include/linux/dvb/video.h
../include/linux/dvb/version.h
../include/linux/dvb/osd.h
../include/linux/dvb/net.h
../include/linux/dvb/frontend.h
../include/linux/dvb/dmx.h
../include/linux/dvb/ca.h
../include/linux/dvb/audio.h
Don't you like the extra directory?
Marcus
