The Linux Security Modules project provides a lightweight, general
purpose framework for access control.  The LSM interface enables
security policies to be developed as loadable kernel modules.
See 
http://lsm.immunix.org
 for more information.
2.5.59-lsm1 patch released.  This is a rebase up to 2.5.59 as well as
some minor interface and module updates.  Out of tree projects will want
to resync with interface changes.
