I forgot to say that I'm trying this in 2.6.9. I've tried options like this:
ncr_53c400a=1 ncr_addr=0x350 ncr_irq=255
also tried ncr_53c400=1 (without the 'a'), various addresses and IRQs.
It never worked. I always get "scsi0: bus busy, attempting abort", etc.
and even Oops sometimes.

My card has no jumpers - only solder points for two 3-pin jumpers and it
doesn't look like it can do ISAPnP.
I've made a simple test program in pascal to test the magic sequences in
DOS. The card ignores the magic sequences that the g_NCR5380 driver
uses. When I use the sequences obtained from MINI400I.SYS using DOSemu,
it "works" - I can read/write the card's registers at the configured
base address. The IRQ (2,3,4,5 and 7) can be configured by the magic
sequence too (by setting the high-order bits in the last number in the 
sequence).
So I know how to configure my card, maybe I should try to add it to the
driver (e.g. by adding ncr_53c400a_hp=1 parameter). If I only could get
the register mapping correctly (I think that this is the problem now).
The g_NCR5380 driver moves the base address by +8 bytes for 53C400 chips 
(but not for 53C400A) and defines the 53C400 specifis register offsets 
negative. This looks weird to me - either the 53C400A does not have 
these additional registers or the driver is broken and is trying to 
access these registers outside the I/O range on 53C400A.

I know it's old, cheap and bad - I just want to make it work. I remember
that it worked in DOS/Windows 3.1. I was not successful in Windows 98 -
although there is an official driver from HP.
P.S. I've removed the Ingmar Baumgart's e-mail address from CC as it
does not work.
