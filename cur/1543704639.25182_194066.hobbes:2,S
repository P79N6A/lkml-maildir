Let me ask a question which probably has an obvious answer... why do you
care to balance the irq on the siblings of a single CPU? Is there some
hidden value I totally miss?
Noting that WBEL-3.0 balances all of the interrupts *except* NICs, I am
sure I don't understand the benefits of balancing between siblings, but
I'm sure someone will enlighten me.
