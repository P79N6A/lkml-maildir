Nonsense. The sg driver still arbitrates h/w access. It just happens
to take a hands-off policy on what SCSI commands are being delivered
to the h/w, since it makes no claim to have any understanding of each
individual piece of SCSI h/w. The driver still presents an abstraction
that comes with access permissions, a simplified h/w model, and no raw
device access.
If we extend your argument, we end up with the Windows situation - a
stupid little lump of a kernel module for every piece of h/w just
because it has one h/w-specific command that could be communicated by
a generic module (e.g. sg) but such action is no longer is
allowed. Can you say "code bloat" ? Well, not really code per se,
since they're all just distinct modules, but its *stupid*.
If you consider "arbitrating h/w access" to include "filter all
commands and ensure that only known and safe ones are delivered", then
sure, you're model makes sense. 
But its clear what this model does to Windows, without any apparent
way of preventing the kinds of disasters that Andre was worried about,
and with the enormous cost of loads of driver code (more likely,
binary-only modules) floating around, driver version numbers,
installation floppies, etc. etc.

No Thank You.
The point of a protocol standard like SCSI is to provide a way to
deliver commands to an end-point. If the command set understood by the
end-point happens to include "SelfDestruct", then we should make that
only highly capable tasks can issue the command, but to limit the
command set to those that are known will make life pretty miserable.
