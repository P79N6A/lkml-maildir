>But I guess using GSI/vector internally only would be fine.
The last time I tried to name a variable "gsi" instead of "irq",
Linus launched into a tirade that "GSI" doesn't mean anything to him,
or anybody else that googles it.  On the other hand "IRQ" means
something
to everybody, and if you google it you find all kinds of interesting
interrupt-related things.
My point was that "IRQ" means so many "interrupt related" things to
different people in different contexts, that it is effectively
meaningless.
But Linus was not swayed.
