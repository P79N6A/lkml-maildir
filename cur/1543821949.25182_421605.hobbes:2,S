I did not realize this before, and asked badblocks maintainer Theodore
if badblocks /some/file was supported (the man page says no); but of
course any filesystem can decide to re-allocate blocks for a file.
However, for large files where parts may be bad sectors, I am still
searching for a way to read, then re-write every physical sector
occupied by the file. 
With the purpose to remap the bad sectors inside large MPEG files (where
I would rather have a few zeroed holes than a read error in them).
Anyone know such tooling exists? I suspect it has to use filesystem
specific IOCTL's to query for the blocks involved.
Regards,
Leon
