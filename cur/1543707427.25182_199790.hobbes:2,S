It's not "unresonable", it just means that someone messed up and we are
now letting the user/developer know.  It's normally because someone
named their driver the same name as another one.
Actually, it's nice to see this message get printed out, and not the
"normal" oops that happens around this area for this case.  Something
must be working correctly :)
I'll go fix that printk to put the proper KERN_ level on it...
thanks,
