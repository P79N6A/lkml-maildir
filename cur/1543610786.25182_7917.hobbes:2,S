   The problem with the tree is that if we have a big, eg. 16 GB pagecache,
   then even assuming a perfectly balanced tree, it takes more than 20
   iterations to find the page in the tree.
His tree is per-inode, so you'd need a fully in ram 16GB _FILE_ to get
the bad tree search properties you describe.
I like his patch, a lot.
