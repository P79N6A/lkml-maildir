This seems correct. The areas where something affects the link itself
in the Single Unix Standard say so. Nothing is said about utime() not
following links
In addition it states (of lstat) 
     For symbolic links, the st_mode member will contain meaningful
     information when used with the file type macros, and the st_size
     member will contain the length of the pathname contained in the
     symbolic link. File mode bits and the contents of the remaining
     members of the stat structure are unspecified.
which strongly implies the other fields arent regarded as mattering
