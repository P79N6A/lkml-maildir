If you try to make a PIII/500 fill 100mbit of TCP/IP using lots of different
processes, that IS a corner load.
I'm sure you can fix this (rare) workload but are you very sure you are not
killing off performance for other situations?
I get flashbacks to the old days of the VM where we had lots patches around
that would all solve (more or less) real problems, but never all at the same
time..
