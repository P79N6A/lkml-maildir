I don't know exactly which  card is on my friends board
i thought it is soundblaster and tried ioport=0x220 which i found on the
net.But it didn't work.SO is there any way of finding the address ?
or any list to guess 0x230 etc
pnpdump shows
# Trying port address 03ab
# Trying port address 03b3
# Trying port address 03bb
# Trying port address 03e3
# Trying port address 03eb
# Trying port address 03f3
# No boards found
I cut the above ports
i tried sndconfig but didn't work
P.S. CC me
