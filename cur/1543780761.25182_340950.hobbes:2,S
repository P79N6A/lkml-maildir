Subject: fcntl(F_GETLEASE) semantics??

Hi,
	The LTP test fcntl23 is failing.  It does, in essence, 
	fd = open(xxx, O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0777);
	if (fcntl(fd, F_SETLEASE, F_RDLCK) == -1)
	   fail;
fcntl always returns EAGAIN here.  The manual page says that a read
lease causes notification when `another process' opens the file for
writing or truncates it.  The kernel implements `any process'
(including the current one).
Which semantics are correct?  Personally I think that what the kernel
implements is correct (you can't get a read lease unsless there are no
writers _at_ _all_)
