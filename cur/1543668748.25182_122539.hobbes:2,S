I don't use any anti-virus software, but from what you say, I may conclude the 
following:
When listing a directory with "ls", the function ncp_obtain_info() is called 
once for each entry in that directory, plus one time for the directory itself 
and (presumably) one time for the directory therunder (".." ?).
If you do this for a volume-root, you are trying to get the Original 
Name-Space of a directory under the volume, which makes the Netware-3.12 
server bark.
The error I am getting on the server goes like this: 
"GetOriginalNameSpace could not find the originating name space. DOS name was 
assumed. Use vrepair to fix this!"
If NULL paths are legal, then the problem lies elsewere (of course it does !).
If you could give me some pointers on where to look, I'll try to find out how 
to make ncpfs not call ncp_obtain_info() for the directory under a volume. 
Putting the check directly into ncp_obtain_info() doesn't seem a good place 
to me....
BTW, I am also having another problem with listing the directory contents of 
the directory where the Novell Server was mounted. I don't know if I will 
have time to get to the ground of this though, since it looks like a problem 
with the driver not handling i-nodes correctly with newer kernels. I get this 
behaviour:
