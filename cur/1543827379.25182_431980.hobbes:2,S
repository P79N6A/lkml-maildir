Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Stacked GIT 0.10
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Stacked GIT 0.10 release is available from 
http://www.procode.org/stgit/.
StGIT is a Python application providing similar functionality to Quilt
(i.e. pushing/popping patches to/from a stack) on top of GIT. These
operations are performed using GIT commands and the patches are stored
as GIT commit objects, allowing easy merging of the StGIT patches into
other repositories using standard GIT functionality.
The main features in this release:
    *  Handle branch names with slashes
    * Testsuite framework
    * Configurable file extensions for merge conflicts
    * 'goto' command, equivalent to 'pop --to' or 'push --to'
    * '--update' option for 'pick' to only fold the changes to files
      already in the current patch
    * '--replace' option for 'import' to replace existing patches in
      the series
    * Look for templates in ~/.stgit/templates as well
    * Allow multiple patch names on the 'push' command line
    * Classify commands in 'stg --help' output
    * Bug fixes
