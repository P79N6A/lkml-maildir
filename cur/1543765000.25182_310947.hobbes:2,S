Hi,
I just noticed that in scsi_ioctl.c (Kernel 2.6.11.7), there are fallthroughs
in the sshdr.sense_key switch (Line 124 and beyond):
[...]
		case NOT_READY:	/* This happens if there is no disc in drive */
			if (sdev->removable && (cmd[0] != TEST_UNIT_READY)) {
				printk(KERN_INFO "Device not ready. Make sure"
				       " there is a disc in the drive.\n");
				break;
			}
***** ---> Fallthrough there is device is not removeable or command is not TEST_UNIT_READY
		case UNIT_ATTENTION:
			if (sdev->removable) {
				sdev->changed = 1;
				sreq->sr_result = 0;	/* This is no longer considered an error */
				break;
			}
***** ---> Fallthrough there is device is not removeable
		default:	/* Fall through for non-removable media */
[...]
I was wondering if this is intentional and if yes, this should be
clearly marked as such (The usual /* FALLTHROUGH */). If this is
intentional, then the logic in this statement is seriously in need of
documentation... :-)
	Regards
		Henning
