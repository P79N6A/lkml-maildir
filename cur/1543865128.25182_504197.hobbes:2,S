ide-scsi and libata support this correctly. Ingo Molnar also ported the
recent CD changes related to size handling. None of these are relevant to
hard disks

All the IBM and Maxtor drives I've played with correctly error when a
sector isn't available. It's pretty implausible they would do otherwise
as the "sector" is a logically mapping onto the drives internal file
system these days.
Fed a wrong sector any drive I know of will report that the sector cannot
be found.
