That is correct -- sem->count should be zero or less at that point.  If it

All readers, regardless if they own the bias or not wait on sem->wait, not
sem->write_bias_wait.  When someone sets read_bias_granted, they do a
wakeup on sem->wait, not sem->write_bias_wait, which wakes up all readers
since they're not exclusive.  Of course, this will also wake one writer
who is waiting, leading to a small stampede type race if the writer gets
in before the readers.  So adding a count of sleeping readers is probably
the right thing.
I'd like to combine the two wait queues, but I haven't convinced myself
that playing the game of putting an exclusive task at the head of
rwsem->wait is safe yet.

Pretty close! =)
