That would be best, but if you have trouble, you could surround the
trouble area with a: tracing_stop(); tracing_start(); That will prevent
tracing within those locations. The function tracer will still be
called, but it will exit the function without doing anything else.
Note: that stops tracing on all CPUS, not just the CPU that called it.
