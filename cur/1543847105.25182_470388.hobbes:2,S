So I'm not at all as sure about this as about the "regs" stuff.
The "regs" value has always been controversial. It's pretty much always 
existed (due to the keyboard hander and the magic debugging keysequences), 
and anybody who looks at 0.01 will quickly realize that the keyboard 
driver was one of the very first drivers (I think it's even written in 
assembly at that point: originally _all_ of what was to become Linux was 
pure asm, the whole "oh, cool, I could write this part in C" came later). 
But it's been pretty much a special case since day #1, purely for that 
"press a key to see where the h*ck we hung" case.
In contrast, the irq argument itself is really no different from the 
cookie we pass in on registration - it's just passing it back to the 
driver that requested the thing. So unlike "regs", there's not really 
anything strange about it, and there's nothing really "wrong" with having 
it there.
So I'm not at all as convinced about this one.
