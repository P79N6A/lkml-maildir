What if the timeout happens, does the "up", *then* the irq happens
while still in the timeout routine?
Consider using two flags, as a debugging aid.
flag_irq_happened
flag_timeout_happened
You can then check 4 possible outcomes:
1. irq happened, no timeout (expected operation)
2. no irq, normal timeout   (expected failure)
3. both irq and timeout happened.  The window for this may be small,
   but small windows eventually happen - perhaps several times in a
minute.
4. neither happened, so something else went wrong with the semaphore.

Maybe.  Take a look at the generated code, check if the memory read is
optimized away. (I.e. flagvar is "cached" in a register in 
function_called_from_kernel_thread().  Or substituted for the
constant "1", as gcc notices that "flagvar" isn't changed between
the assignment and the test using a false assumption about no parallell 
execution. "volatile" is supposed to help with that, telling the
compiler
that "this thing may change in mysterious ways, unknown to the generated
code,
i.e. other unknown code or hardware.
