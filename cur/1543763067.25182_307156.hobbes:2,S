Yes and BTW those are from a hardware point of view a technically 
perfectly
fine solution. The obstacles here are two fold: Win32 kernel sucks big 
rocks
on latency issues. However since the time we are over 1GHz and use XP 
they work perfectly
fine. On Linux you don't get the necessary DSP processing code/docs. 
Both are just pragmatical arguments which don't apply to sound 
processing at all.
And for you note - I'm the guy who several years ago wrote the first 
ever GDI-Printer
driver for Linux (oki4linux) despite claims from quite prominent people 
here that this couldn't be ever done. And yes I did it in user space 
because pages are not data streams.
