/proc/scsi/scsi is deprecated, so please don't recommend it here.
The proper way is the scan attribute of the scsi host.

This should show up in sysfs.

no need for the braces here.  This should be:
		if (megasas_mgmt_info.instance[i] &&
		    megasas_mgmt_info.instance[i]->host->host_no == host_no)

This is a rather complicated and fragile way to implement this feature.
I'd recomment to change the call to scsi_scan_host in megasas_io_attach
to something like:
	if (fast_load) {
		int channel;
		for (channel = 0; channel < MEGASAS_MAX_PD_CHANNELS;
		     channel++) {
			scsi_scan_host_selected(host, channel, SCAN_WILD_CARD,
						SCAN_WILD_CARD, 0);
		}
	} else {
		scsi_scan_host(host);
	}
