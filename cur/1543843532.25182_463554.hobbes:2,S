I didn't get the "instrumentation is evil" mantra from this thread,
rather "static tracepoints are good, so long as someone else is
maintaining them". The issue comes down to who ends up maintaining the
trace points, and given with how intrusive LTT was in the past, I can't
see anyone wanting to suddenly start littering them around the kernel
now (at least in the areas that they're responsible for, particularly if
it's not something that's going to be useful to most people). Admittedly
LTTng is not as bad at this as LTT was in this regard, though.
If static tracepoints are something that's useful for you, then you
can continue maintaining them out of tree.

kprobes may not be the answer to all lifes problems, but it is
non-intrusive once the initial implementation pains are out of the way..

For someone complaining about meaningless posturing on the list, posting
this as a representation for the isolated changes involved is rather
interesting. If it were down to a small handful of critical static
tracepoints in-tree and the rest left up to the people that really want
them in out-of-tree patches, I doubt LTT would have ever had half of the
resistance towards it.
It's the intrusiveness that becomes the maintenance burden, and if you
whittle it down to a point where the intrusiveness is not that big of a
deal, then I'm not sure I see what static points would buy you over
dynamic instrumentation.
It's easy to write off the maintenance overhead when you aren't the one
maintaining the code..
