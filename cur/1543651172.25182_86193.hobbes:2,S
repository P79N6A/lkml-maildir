Ugh, have you tried to use this patch in real life with the busses that
use driver_data today?  I didn't think so :)
In short, only the driver's individual probe function knows how big of a
data chunk it needs, and that probe function isn't known until probe()
is called.  Hm, well ok, match() could set this, but then it would have
to call into the function found by match to get the size.  By then it's
just really not worth adding this extra complexity to the code.
So in short, I don't like this, and don't really see where it buys you
anything.
But I did like your pci private data cleanup patch from the other day,
mind if I add that into the next round of pci cleanups I'm going to be
sending to Linus?
thanks,
