Hello...
The organization I do some work for purchased a rackmount server from 
Dell with the intent of running some webconferencing software under
Linux.  The salesman we had spoken to assured us that Linux fully
supported the machine.  <sarcasm> Yeah... Right... </sarcasm> :)
Now it seems I'm stuck with a PERCRAID 3 card that only has support in 
the form of a binary kernel module for kernel 2.2.14 (w/ redhat's
patches).  While the box runs fine with this kernel, I would definatly
like to upgrade the kernel to something that doesn't have so many known
flaws ;)  The machine is already in use so switching raid cards isn't much
of an option at this time.
A check of Dell's (rather horrible) support website only turns up the
binary module mentioned above. Does anyone know anything about these
PERCRAID 3 cards and if there is an opensource driver? or at least a
binary module for a newer kernel?
Thanks for your time...
