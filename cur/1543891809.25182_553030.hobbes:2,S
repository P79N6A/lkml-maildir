I have two questions for getting the bigger picture:
1. How much code will be changed?
Looking at the F00F bug fixup example, it seems we'll have to make
several functions in every single driver conditional in the kernel for 
getting the best performance.
How many functions to you plan to make conditional this way?
2. What is the real-life performance improvement?
That micro benchmarks comparing cache hits with cache misses give great 
looking numbers is obvious.
But what will be the performance improvement in real workloads after the
functions you plan to make conditional according to question 1 have been 
made conditional?
TIA
