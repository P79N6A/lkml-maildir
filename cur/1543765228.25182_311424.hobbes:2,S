What previous patch?  radix tree allocation doesn't use mempools, so this
patch will cause add_to_swap() to oom the machine with radix tree node
allocations.
Now if we were to add __GFP_NOMEMALLOC in add_to_swap() then things would
work as we want them to.
The dm_crypt change looks OK.
The code in mpage.c is saying "if we failed to allocate a correctly-sized
bvec and if we're doing pageout then try to allocate a smaller-sized bvec
instead".
It's probably fairly useless, but afaict there's nothing in any of the
other patches here which makes it redundant.
