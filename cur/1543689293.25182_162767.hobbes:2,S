A coworker put a script on a server which loads up quite afew arrays
with pre-set values and then compares the values against arrays.  As soon as he 
kicked off the script I got alot of these in my log files.  Not much longer and the 
machine crashed hard.
Quad proc P3-550
16Gigs of RAM
Kernel: 2.4.22-rc2-ac3
CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G=y
CONFIG_HIGHMEM=y
Anyone have any thoughts or know what this means?  Do I have a HIGHMEM
problem?
:wq!
