OK - speaking of this I just want call one public (exported) function of library from another.

OK - so speaking of kernel thread - what function should I use? Or do you think that only the difference of having process context and pid will cause read to work? (I'm willing to believe it ;-) - I'll try it later)
I think there are reasons (speed, speed, speed...)  why some things should be done kernel-space. And I think that this is one of them. I know that I'll never want to "send data from anywhere in the known universe" (famous last words?) - I just need to create backup copy of file.
