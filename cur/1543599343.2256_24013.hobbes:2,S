While it is true that M = 10^6 and k = 10^3, surely that doesn't apply to 
byte quantities?!? At least I have always interpreted 1 Megabyte = 1024 
kilobytes = 1024*1024 bytes, and I think the poster meant the same when 
writing 1MB = 1000k...
If we are nitpicking, he probably should have written 1MiB = 1000kiB. [Feel 
free to correct me if I am wrong, but IIRC, Mi and ki are the abbreviations 
for 2^10 multiples rather than 10^3...]
