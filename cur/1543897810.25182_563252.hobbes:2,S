There is one little problem with this: there is no stable URL for a given 
version. This hurts, e.g., automated Linux From Scratch rebuilds (the 
official script grabs the URL from the book, but it becomes invalid too soon).
Could you please, in order to avoid this, do what SAMBA team does: place 
into 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/manpages/Old
 not only old 
versions, but also the current version? This way, LFS will be sure that the 
2.60 version is always available as 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/manpages/Old/man-pages-2.60.tar.bz2
 
(even if it is in fact the latest version).
Thanks in advance.
