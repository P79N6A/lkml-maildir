POSIX capabilities are explictly disjoint from
userids in the kernel, and this is by design.
You could provide limited capability sets to
users at the application layer.

Give the file the capability and set an
ACL that allows only that user execute access.

Have a look in /etc/irix.cap on a Trix box
