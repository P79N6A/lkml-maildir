One solution (if you really cannot scale using multiple processes) is the 
one that you're describing, where you have many threads doing epoll_wait. 
You have to be careful to not fetch too many event on a single wait 
(preferably one), otherwise you can end up with period of time with 
pending events on a single thread, while others are free to spin. If the 
timers that you are using are simply to timeout pending operations, the 
timer resolution does not need to be that high, so you could use a 
maximum timeout of a second or so for epoll_wait (and handle timers like 
you planned). Another solution would be to have a single epoll_wait loop 
thread that feeds your threads that are waiting on a mutex, protecting an 
event queue from which threads pull events. This will make timeout 
handling somehow easier, but delivering an event would mean a ctx switch 
to wake the epoll_wait thread, plus another one waking a processing 
thread.

Like lingering IRQs, nobody cared :-) Linus also proposed a "signal fd", 
that could have been used for timers, but nobody showed interest either.
