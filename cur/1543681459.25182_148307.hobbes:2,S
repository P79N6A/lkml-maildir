I am implementing a poll method in a driver. I have defined a queue which I
put into a wait table with a call to poll_wait. I also have my own DMA input
list which is very specific to my device. I want my application to sleep in
a suspended state until my device writes some data into the input list. Is
it not so that the Kernel should periodically call my poll routine after my
application calls select (until the select timer expires or as in my case, I
specify a NULL value for the timeout). Please CC me directly on any
responses.
