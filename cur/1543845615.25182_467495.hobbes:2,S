Hi,
anyone here who has experience with greylisting and the linux-kernel
list? I want to configure greylisting on my server but I don't know if
this setting is compatible with the list here.
What I want to avoid is a massive bounce because of that! So please give
me feedback, if greylisting is a problem for the list.
Cheers,
Michael Obster
