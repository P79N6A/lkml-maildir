Andreas,
did you test it in a kernel without SMP compiled in ?
I'm a little afraid about what can happen here:
- --- a/arch/x86/kernel/setup_64.c
+++ b/arch/x86/kernel/setup_64.c
@@ -998,7 +998,7 @@ void __cpuinit print_cpu_info(struct cpuinfo_x86 *c)
 static int show_cpuinfo(struct seq_file *m, void *v)
 {
 	struct cpuinfo_x86 *c = v;
- -	int cpu = 0;
+	int cpu = c->cpu_index;
The attribuition of cpu_index only happens in a code that seems to be
called for all cpus but the boot one.
So it could even work, but as accident. Unless I'm wrong about it, I'd
prefer to see an explicit attribution of cpu_index = 0 somewhere for the
boot cpu.
Other than that, good catch! I didn't notice it, because all my present
cpus were online in my box
