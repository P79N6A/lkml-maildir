This is the most illogical and perverse argument I think I have *ever* seen
on this mailing list, and that's saying something.
If people find legitimate uses for it while it's available, that's a proof
that taking it away is wrong. Symbols are supposed to be marked GPL if and
only if it's not possible to use them in non-GPL'd works. So, yeah, let's
not risk letting people prove your position is wrong before you have a
chance to enforce it.
