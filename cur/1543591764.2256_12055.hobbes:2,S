Hi,
I am using Proxim Symphony Wireless LAN card on one of my systems with kernel
2.2.19. I may reinstall with a different Linux distro and upgrade to kernel 2.4.
The Proxim Symphony Wireless LAN site (
http://www.komacke.com
) has disappeared.
Does anyone know where I can find drivers for Linux for this product?
TIA.
