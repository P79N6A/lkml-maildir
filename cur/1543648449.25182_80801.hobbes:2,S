Sure, coming under separate cover.

initrd.  Will try booting without initrd and see if memcounts go back to 
normal.  On the current setup, when the thing locks up, Shift-ScrollLock 
dumps the meminfo.  Of interest here is the line right after the 
Zone:HighMem line which reads:
( Active:1634 inactive:1603 dirty:4294966795 writeback:0 free:59222 )
Booting without initrd solves the lockup issue.  It also clears up the 
dirty count.  So, initrd is what's corrupting things.  I'll try the patch 
and let you know if it solves the initrd corruption here in a sec.
