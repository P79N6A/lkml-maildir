Right - that's Unix "inside the box" thinking. The idea is to make the 
operating system smarter so that the user doesn't have to deal with 
what's computer friendly - but reather what makes sense to the user. 
 From a user's perspective if you have not rights to access a file then 
why should you be allowed to delete it?
Now - the idea is to create choice. If you need to emulate Unix nehavior 
for compatibility that's fine. But I would migrate away from that into a 
permissions paradygme that worked like Netware.
I started with Netware and I'm spoiled. They had it right 15 years ago 
and Linux isn't any where near what I was with Netware and DOS in 1990. 
Once you've had this kind of permission power Linux is a real big step down.
So - the thread is about the future so I say - time to fix Unix.
