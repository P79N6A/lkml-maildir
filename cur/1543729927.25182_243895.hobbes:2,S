Seems reasonable to me for Linux timer driver (resource) to allocate
0x40 - 0x43 and 0x50 - 0x53 (on intel x86; only 0x40 - 0x43 for AMD x86-64).
At least that's what is in some Intel specs.  That would be accurate
AFAIK and still leave 0x4e - 0x4f available.
What kind of device uses IO addresses 0x4e - 0x4f?
Is it a motherboard device?  Intel ICH specs think that 0x4e - 0x4f
are for LPC SIO and are forwarded to the LPC device.
