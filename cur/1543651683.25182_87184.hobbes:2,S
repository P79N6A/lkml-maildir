The locking of walking the tasklist seems non-trivial, but we may well
end up with something like that. By the time you finish, it looks more
like a /dev device thing than /proc (which I'm fine with), and looks
rather like the patch that was posted earlier in this thread. Ideally
I'd like fewer ioctls than that, and lower syscall overhead, but it
seems much closer to functional than the current system.
