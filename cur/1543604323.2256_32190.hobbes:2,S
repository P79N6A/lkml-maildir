There's a small problem with this one: I know that during testing of 
earlier 2.4 kernels we saw a livelock which was caused by the vm 
subsystem spinning without scheduling.  This can happen in a couple of 
cases like NFS where another task has to be allowed to run in order to 
make progress in clearing pages.
