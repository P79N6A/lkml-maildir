Why not do it in the X server itself?  This will avoid controversial
policy in the kernel, and have the added advantage of working with
X servers that don't directly access hardware.
Con, if you tell me ``if you're running under Linux and such and such
/sys variable has value so-and-so, then it's definitely a good idea to
call nice(42) at the X server's start up'', then I'll commit it into
X.Org.  (Please CC both me the list, so I can point any people
complaining to the archives.)
