Ah, good point... I focused a bit too much on the single problem at hand
didn't I.  :)

If it's just there for debug, maybe leaving an assert is ok, to get a
dump & system state etc.  If it is converted, a printk would probably be
good so you know you're falling back, otherwise that extra checking is a
bit pointless if it's silent.

Looks good, thanks for not ignoring the other asserts.  ;-)  I wonder if
we should fix up all the new error condition printk's a bit to be more
descriptive of the problem at hand; for example, the one I sent should
maybe say:
+		ext3_warning(dir->i_sb, __FUNCTION__,
+			     "Corrupt root limit in dir inode %ld\n", dir->i_ino);
I wanted to leave the word "corrupt" in there, or at least something to
clue in the user that maybe fsck is in order...
Thanks,
-Eric
