The following patch appears to fix the problem.  However, I would
really appreciate if someone more familiar with UNIX credential
passing could review what I did here and provide some feedback.
It wasn't at all clear to me why the MSG_PEEK and !MSG_PEEK code
paths were taking different actions regarding credentials, so I
unified them to behave the same way as the !MSG_PEEK code path.
I haven't tested credential passing under this new code yet, but
hope to do so tomorrow.  Again, a review with an eye towards
that area would be most appreciated.
The various test cases I had which tripped this bug now pass without
incident.  Also, if netstat is to be believed, quite a few programs
which utilize AF_UNIX sockets (e.g. hald, dbus, acpid) are running
very contentedly on the test system, so at least I didn't severely
break anything, possible UNIX credential issues notwithstanding.
Note: I'm not proposing this patch be integrated yet -- I'm throwing
it out here as a starting point.
