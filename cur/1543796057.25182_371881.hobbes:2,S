This is the correct behavior.  Under Linux, the driver should export 
only the underlying hardware, and nothing more.  This is how all the 
SATA controller drivers function, and this is how aic79xx functions.
Use a tool such as 'dmraid' for vendor-proprietary RAID solutions.
Your patch is therefore strongly NAK'd.
