This is "Support for Large Block Devices" under Device Drivers/Block
Devices:
CONFIG_LBD:
Say Y here if you want to attach large (bigger than 2TB) discs to
your machine, or if you want to have a raid or loopback device
bigger than 2TB.  Otherwise say N.
The "2e73" refers to 2 to the exponent 73 bytes in size. Huge :-)
