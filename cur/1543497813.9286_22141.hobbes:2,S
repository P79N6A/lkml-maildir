Yes.  When I do auto IRQ with setserial, it returns something
like:  IRQ -1023128419585
Since I only have 15 IRQ's on my machine, and since some of them
are taken, and none negative - I'd say that setserial
autodetection doesn't work right.  My modem is on IRQ, which
nothing else is conflicting with.  Windows 95 gets the IRQ right
without asking, it is not a winmodem.
I haven't tried the kernel level autoirq yet...  I will though
soon...
Take care,
