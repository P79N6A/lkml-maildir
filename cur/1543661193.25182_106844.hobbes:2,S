Yes it would but the load effect is significantly diminished. By writing a 
file the size==physical ram the load effect is substantial.

I found the following is how loads occur almost always:
noload time: 60
load time kernal a: 80, loads 20
load time kernel b: 100, loads 40
load time kernel c: 90, loads 30
and loads/total time wouldnt show this effect as kernel c would appear to have 
a better load rate 
if there was
load time kernel d: 80, loads 40
that would be more significant no?
