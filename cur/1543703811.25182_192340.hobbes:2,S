I said "works with the kernel community".  It's not about control, it's
about co-operation.  The control you seek simply does not exist in the
kernel development process.

In the previous thread about the driver you said "You can integrate the
driver at whatever revision suits you.", so I took you at your word; if
that wasn't what you meant, it's a little late to whine about it now. 
Small bug fixes, would, as ever, be welcome...
As for blame, apart from the occasional flamewar, the community seems
generally welcoming of anyone who provides fixes.  We tend to be more
interested in fixing things than assigning blame.

The recovery code does work.  You may want it to work differently, and
that may make it work better, but that's an enhancement not a bug fix.

But it does do it successfully.  Something that currently works but
could work better is an enhancement not a bug.

Again, this is could do better not required bug fix.
I'm not against enhancements, even at this late stage in the
stabilisation process.  However, they have to be small, self contained
and obviously correct.  If you have them, send them to the list and
they'll get reviewed.
