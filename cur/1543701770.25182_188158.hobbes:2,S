Hi chaps!  
My system hangs (no oops, nothing) on disk access using either 2.4.23 or 2.6.0. A rather reliable way for me to  
crash it is to, for example, copy the sources of the Linux kernel.  
It hanged once on CD-ROM access, which could lead to a more IDE-level problem. Also, the only time it did it in  
another operating system (humm...) was after it crashed in Linux and I pressed reset (no shut down), which  
makes me think it could the IDE controller [driver]'s fault...  
It seems I'm the only one on Earth to have this problem (according to Google), but if there was a way to track it 
down I'd be happy to try.  
I have attached my 2.6.0 kernel config for info.  
Thanks!  
Hervé.
