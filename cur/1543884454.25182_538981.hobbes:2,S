And how is this better?  In this world of yours a program must have
one file descriptor for each single futex which is used like this *per
thread*.  There can be hundreds, thousands of threads.  And there can
be large numbers of futexes, too.
This is not going to fly.  You reach the file descriptor limit just
with this.  And this in many processes on the system.

I don't know what  you want to show here.  You 10 new syscalls?  You
have two patches alone modifying futexes?  And 22 patches in total.
That's not "a lot"?
