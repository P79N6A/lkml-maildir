No netpoll interface.  netpoll is not in the standard kernel, kdb
patches are only against the standard kernels.
For legacy free hardware, kdb v4.3 has a working USB keyboard polled
mode.  Build with
CONFIG_USB=y
CONFIG_USB_UHCI=y (or OHCI)
CONFIG_USB_HID=m
CONFIG_USB_HIDINPUT=y
CONFIG_USB_KBD=y
CONFIG_KDB_USB=y

Sounds like kdb is itself dying.  Insufficient data to diagnose, in any
case there have been a lot of bug fixes and enhancements to kdb since
v3.0.
