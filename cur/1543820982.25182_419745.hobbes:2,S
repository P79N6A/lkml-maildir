Here at last is a sane response. If the kernel were enhanced/bastardized 
(pick one) to support C++ modules, we could evaluate how C++ actually 
does in terms of runtime and developer performance.

Since such patches are sure to be rejected (apparently renaming 'struct 
class' would wreak havoc on the development process), I doubt that they 
will appear. Not to mention the attacks on the submitters that would follow.
