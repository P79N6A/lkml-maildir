Hi Ingo, Thomas, Steve and all others,
   Just checking in to say that 2.6.17-rt1 is up and running here on
my AMD64 machine on the first try. It's been running for about an
hour. No problems so far. No messages in dmesg. Everything looks fine
so far.
   It's probably my imagination but it seems that Jack is using less
CPU. I'm normally used to seeing 2-3%. With this kernel QJackCtl is
reporting less than 1%. Is that real?
   Great work all! Thanks for all the help.
Cheers,
Mark
