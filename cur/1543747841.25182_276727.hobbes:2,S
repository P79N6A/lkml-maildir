Well, I'm no coder and therefore follow instructions to the letter, 
almost (; <-- ehum), which meant that "put back" became lines 613-615 in 
mm/page_alloc.c
might_sleep_if(wait);
if (wait)
        cond_resched();
Now interpreting it as the lines should be
might_sleep_if(wait);

the kernel boots without problems. Have yet to test the oom-killer with 
my rogue app. Won't return unless there's problems.
