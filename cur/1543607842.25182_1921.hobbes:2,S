Note that the 2.2 kernel code is (AFAIK) quite different from the 2.4
kernel code for drivers/char/random.c.  The serious bug - not incrementing
"in" was introduced in 2.3.16.  The other real bug - trunctating the pool
entropy to the number of words in the pool, does not exist in 2.2.  It
correctly compares it agains POOLBITS.
Cheers, Andreas
