The above patch also fixed my problems using NFS mounted home directories.
I already applied it yesterday without giving any feedback, so I just
thought I should comment.
In addition I totally agree with Satyam's comment above: either
anybody is testing rc's these days, or people simply stopped reporting.
My concern is that we have to live with a git tree that has this
problem, because core developers are unavailable and nobody has the
authority to commit this fix. (That was already posted before).
I am not voting for public commit rights and personally I don't want
them anyway. It's just my observation that nothing really happens
whenever a point release is only a few days away.
Maybe most people believe that they have to wait for the 2.6.24
cycly to start before they join the discussion again ...
