  Modems are tricky, because they're frequently WinModems which
have a whole lot of well-known issues.  Other features depend on
the speed at which they can be reverse engineered, as most
WinCE manufacturers don't co-operate.  I'd be surprised if any
WindowsCE machine's hardware was fully supported by LinuxSH yet,
but I don't have a full list anywhere (sorry).  I'd guess the HP
Jornada 600 series are probably best supported.
Greg.
