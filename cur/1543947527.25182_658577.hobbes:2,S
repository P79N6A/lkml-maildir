| We should introduce head32.c and then we can use the exact same function
| as 64 bit does:
| 
| /* Don't add a printk in there. printk relies on the PDA which is not initialized
|    yet. */
| static void __init clear_bss(void)
| {
|         memset(__bss_start, 0,
|                (unsigned long) __bss_stop - (unsigned long) __bss_start);
| }
| 
| This answers your Q.
| 
| I already resubmitted Eric's original patch to introduce head32.c as I also
| liked the cleanup in two Makefiles.
