:) Well... there was a discussion about this on the netfilter-devel
list some weeks ago. 
This is definitely not a 2.5 / 2.6 issue, as it could be easily implemented
by using the already existing flexibility of netfilter/iptables.
It's just a matter of somebody who needs it getting around actually 
implementing it. Could be either implemented as a 'raw' netfilter 
hook-attaching module or (more convenient) as a new iptables target, 
which allocates some internal tables for storing the accounting data.
Doesn't make sense to have a discussion about it on linux-kernel, and
it certainly doesn't belong into a 2.5 featurelist.
