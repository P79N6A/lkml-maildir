Thanks, I've applied this with a fix (you left the declaration of
skipchars in main(), so it shadowed the new global one).
I also repaired the testsuite after this patch (and found another bug
along the way), which also would have caught the mistake (Hint hint!).
I've put the lot up in the usual place, masquerading as 0.9.13-pre2.
