MERRY XMAS TO ALL OF YOU! =)
For the fashion of Minas Tirith was such that it was built on seven
levels, each delved into a hill, and about each was set a wall, and in
each wall was a gate. -- J.R.R. Tolkien, "The Return of the
King" [Quoted in "VMS Internals and Data Structures", V4.4, when
referring to system overview.]
