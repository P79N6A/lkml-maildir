Its apparent to me that you don't have our hardware, nor have you
actually waded thru this driver source code. 
If you did, you would of noticed that the header you want to delete, is
actually referenced in the *.c source code.   The file "mpi_log_fc.h",
is indeed mentioned in mptbase.c, in the function called
mpt_fc_log_info, in the documention section above the function.    This
header file is very helpful to those supporting our hardware, and those
using it
For SAS(mpi_log_sas.h), I have broken out each loginfo in the strings
you will find defined in originator_str, iop_code_str, pl_code_str, etc,
I probably do that with fibre.
If its that important to you to have the header files included, I will
provide a patch that does that.
