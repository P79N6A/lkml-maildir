I haven't checked this in a while but when we experimented with keeping
zero'd pages on separate lists before, the performance sucked. I haven't
looked at it in a *long* time though.

I imagine that adding an additional per-cpu list will not be welcome.

And that growing cold appeared to hurt before. It could be checked out
again though. The anti-fragmentation breaks out the buddy lists already
and has the ability to search the per-cpu lists for pages of an
appropriate type.
I'll try and find an hour or two to hack something together to see what
it looks like but I suspect it'll still be a performance loss. At least
then though, we can see if quicklists are a better plan or not.
