Nope.  The U320 chips will never be supported in the aic7xxx driver due
to their very different architecture.  aic79xx v1.1.0 (or 1.1.1 which
includes the port to the 2.5.X kernels) is what you want.

Which kernel version it will be folded into is beyond my control.  The
code has been sent to both Marcelo and Linus.
