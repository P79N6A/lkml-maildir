Okay, how about the following instead (I'm thinking of generic code that
we can reuse): continue to queue the mm, address, length tuple (I've
actually got use for this too), and then use a map_mm_kiobuf (which is
map_user_kiobuf but with an mm parameter) for the portion of the buffer
that's currently being copied.  That improves code reuse and gives us a
few primatives that are quite useful elsewhere.

Cool! =)
