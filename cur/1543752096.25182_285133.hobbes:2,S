Actually unsigned long long is still 64 bits even on 64-bit Linux
architectures.  However it might make more sense to use an explicit
size for the resource addresses, namely u64.
This XScale architecture seems similar to the PowerPC 440, which also
uses 36-bit addressing for various buses including PCI.  You might
want to take a look at arch/ppc for inspiration.
