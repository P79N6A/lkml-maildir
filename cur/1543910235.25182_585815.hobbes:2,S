Hi Andi,
This patch breaks Xen booting.  I get infinite recursive faults during
patching when this patch is present.  If I boot with
"noreplace-paravirt" it works OK, and it works as expected if I back
this patch out.  I haven't tracked down the exact failure mode; its a
little hard to debug because it overwrites all kernel memory with
recursive fault stackframes and then finally traps out to Xen when it
hits the bottom of memory.
I think we should back this one out before .23.
