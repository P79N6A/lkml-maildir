Adress space is (on 386) 64TeraBytes pro task. Its enough to have 
4Gbytes phys mem mapped into virutal memory, and 4Gbytes for one 
process
When a task jumps into kernel code, CS is 0x10
When a task is in user mode, CS is 0x23.
It means that it is already two separate 4Gbytes capable spaces.
I agry kernel has to access all physical mem all the time. Just map 
all 4Gbytes phys memory to selector 0x10, and leave 4Gbytes virtual 
space for selector 0x23.

In 386 also: 64Tera bytes address space, 4Gbytes phys space
Even if we say that process can only use 32 bits pointers, we still 
have a full 4Gbytes space for process, and the rest for kernel
