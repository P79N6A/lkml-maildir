The warning is a pest, and is due to do_tty_hangup() bogusly disabling
interrupts in the hope that it does something useful.  It needs to be fixed
up.
But it is unrelated to the PPP failure.  I'm afraid it is so long since I
used PPP and pppd that I cannot suggest how you should set about gathering
extra info on that.
