Subject: RFC: removing DONGLE_OLD drivers?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/9/303

With one exception, all DONGLE_OLD drivers have newer counterparts.
The DONGLE_OLD drivers depend on BROKEN_ON_SMP which e.g. implies that 
the many distributions shipping only SMP-kernels will never offer them.
The one exception is a driver for the Cirrus Logic EDB-7211 evaluation 
board that itself is out of production for some years.
Can we remove these old drivers or is there a good reason for keeping 
them?
