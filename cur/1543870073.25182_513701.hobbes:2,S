We can just thaw the worker thread selectively before kthread_stopping
them. This will let us freeze all worker threads (which we want to for
hotplug anyway).

Hmm ..good point. So can we assume that disable/enable_nonboot_cpus() are called
with processes frozen already?
Gautham, you need to take this into account in your patchset!

See above suggestion of thawing worker thread before kthread_stopping
it.
