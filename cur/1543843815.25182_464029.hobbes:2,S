as the primary factor i'd add:
  - Maintainance intrusiveness
but yes, agreed - with that addition this is a good summary of the 
intrusiveness factors.

do you base this opinion of yours on the kprobes+LTT experiment you did 
yesterday? If yes then would it be possible for you to try the 3 patches 
that i sent, and re-measure the impact of kprobes? The kprobes overhead 
should go down a bit, it would be interesting to see by how much.
Also, when forming your opinion do you consider djprobes - which in 
essence inserts a function call (and not an INT3) into the probed code?

i'm not fundamentally worried about the runtime impact of static probes, 
as long as the impact is unmeasurable. I'm more worried about their 
maintainance impact - so i want the option to move them to a dynamic 
script, if the tracepoint is for example not frequent. (but being a 
perfectionist i cannot completely forget about their runtime overhead 
either)

yeah - hard in the sense of dynamic probing.

yeah. If you look at the API suggestions i made, they are such. There 
can be differences though to 'static tracepoints used by static 
tracers': for example there's no need to 'mark' a static variable, 
because dynamic tracers have access to it - while a static tracer would 
have to pass it into its trace-event function call.
