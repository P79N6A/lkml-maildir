hugetlbfs isn't only used by oracle. Anyways if you were right then why
is there a IPC_CAP_LOCK in hugetlbfs in the first place? If Oracle is
the only user then just drop such check and stop binding rlimits to
persistent fs objects.

if calling chown on hugetlbfs makes no sense then why is chown available
in the first place?
