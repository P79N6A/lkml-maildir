Huh?

It's *NOT* a sane format.

Yes.  It already has one.
Note that you're not only adding ad-hackery (which filesystems get that
major:minor printed and which do not?), you *STILL* hadn't solved your
problem.  Why?  Because you still won't catch e.g. ext3 on /dev/sda5 with
external journal on /dev/sda3.  And if you hack parsing ext3 lines in
/proc/mounts, there's always reiserfs, jfs, etc., etc.  _And_ there's
RAID with the same problems wrt. access to components.  Real funny
when you have raid0 on md0, have md0 mounted and try to fsck one of
components.
Scanning /etc/mtab or /proc/mounts in such situations is wrong.  If fsck
is doing that, it's broken.  The right way to fix it depends on what you
really want and whatever the hell it is, putting new and new fs-specific
code that would parse /proc/mounts lines into fsck(8) is not an answer.
