Odd.  Looks like we've got quotes around the names in /sys/module (but
only for those compiled in--actual modules show correctly).
Anyway, I used /sys/module/"i8042"/parameters/debug, and I'll send you
the dmesg in another email.
The mouse is jerkey and touchy both with and without 5 second pauses.  I
only see the complete mouse "stall" after 5-second pauses, though.
