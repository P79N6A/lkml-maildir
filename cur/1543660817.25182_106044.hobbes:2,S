I took a 16-way NUMA-Q (700MHz P3 Xeon's w/2MB L2 cache) and ran some 
cpu-intensive benchmarks (kernel compile on warm cache with -j32 and
-j 256, SDET 1 - 128 users, and numaschedbench with 1 to 64 processes, 
which is a memory thrasher to test node affinity of memory operations), 
and compared to virgin 2.5.59 - no measurable difference on any test. 
Sorry,
M.
