It is just inline on some old gcc versions that didn't have 
__attribute__((always_inline)). But on these plain inline is usually fine 
- it will just inline. Only later versions of gcc broke their inlining
algorithm, but they luckily added this attribute as a workaround.
When you have functions that require inlining always mark them __always_inline
