Partitioning support was added to the MD software raid layer
in 2.6 recently. Most of it is in Linus' latest tree, though a
tiny part - boot support - is still missing. Hopefully that will
be merged before 2.6.4. I'm running a system on 2 RAID1'ed SATA disks
right now.
MD already has support for more than one type of superblock. I think
if you just add medley (or intel, or ..) support to MD you're all set.
Mike.
