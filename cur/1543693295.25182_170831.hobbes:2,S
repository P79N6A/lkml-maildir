Hi,
just got back from a customer with major problems
with a LTO-drive and an Adaptec 19160.
The problems was ones that HP claimed a firmware
upgrade would fix and even gave a tool for doing this:
hp_ltt.
Running this the first time would always segfault and trying
a second time would consistently panic the system.
We traced the segfault to sg_ioctl trying to do something.
After finding a vague hint with google I tried to boot with
mem=512M (The machine has 2GB of memory) and voila:
The update worked without any crashes.
We don't know yet if the firmware update fixed the original problem,
but the conclusion is:
sg_ioctl seems to address illegal parts of memory when used with
kernels where highmem is enabled.
Any sg-driver maintainers out there?
Best Regards
