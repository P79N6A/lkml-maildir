This was my initial impression. When Manfred clarified me that, a pid
can be in use (as session for example) even if the process corresponding
to that pid has died. The proposed approaches don't make things slower.
It is not just targeted towards get_pid() avoiding re-scan. One of the main
goals was to reduce contention for tasklist_lock.

This doesn't sound good for me (I am sure for most of others too).

They can't be arbitrary numbers. POSIX has defined what p->pgrp
and p->session should be.

Whatever approaches proposed don't stop at making get_pid() better.
They improve/change stuff a lot ofcourse !!
