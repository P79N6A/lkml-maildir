Yes, I beleive it does.

Nope.... that's a disgusting ugly hack that won't work (consider that
there are two 2:00am for example in a given time zone, one DST and one
without, does DOS store a bit to say which is which in ambiguous
cases?)
If anything, the FS should know about a tz-offset and just simply add
that to the timestamps before passing the data up to the VFS...
<pause>
Checking the code, it uses sys_tz to do exactly this...
