I think willy already pointed out the struct pci_dev->resources[] should point 
to MMIO adress ranges the PCI(-X) device "owns".

ditto. I think willy meant walk pci_dev->bus->parent until bus->self
is NULL normally should work.

Why wouldn't this be per PCI host bus controller instead of per CPU?
I'm thinking SMP - any CPU could access any MMIO region.
How those MMIO addresses get routed depends on how PCI Host Bus
controllers are programmed. Ie Bridges have to route MMIO transactions
to children (PCI devices).

Could register/unregister functionality be part of the clear/read errors?

Holding the spinlock might not be realistic for most drivers
during a recovery - ie re-init the HW. I understand this is a
generic example but it's a bit too simple...

And need similar for the register/unregister/readX_check() calls.
