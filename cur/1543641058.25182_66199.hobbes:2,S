I'm not sure about this but IIRC the entry in /etc/modules.conf has to be
options ide-mod options="ide2=ata66 ide3=ata66". So long as you don't get
the override warnings, nothing's changed.
If you're not booting off any IDE device you can try loading
the ide-mod by hand using the command that I've verified works.
