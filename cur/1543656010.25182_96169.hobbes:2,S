Do you have performance data when you program TPR? Today, in 2.5, for
example, we are distributing interrupts among CPUs with Ingo's patch in
software. Doing that in software is fine because it's relatively simple, but
the chipset has more information on the on-going interrupt activities. So
using TPR might work better in general.
One issue with lowest priority delivery mode (as well as Ingo's) is that it
could have negative impacts on L2 caches (actually we saw such instances).
So we also have a patch to balance interrupts load (using statistic data)
without moving them around frequently (mostly static) and I think we can
combine that patch and lowest priority delivery mode.
