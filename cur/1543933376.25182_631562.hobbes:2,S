This is totally the wrong way to go about it.
Instead, it should detect this particular chipset and reserve relevant 
ports.  Even better would be if we can find out what reserves these 
ports and mark it as a quirk.
That being said, I have seen other chipsets allocate ports in the low 
0x1XXX range using non-BAR methods.  They *should* reserve them in ACPI, 
of course.
