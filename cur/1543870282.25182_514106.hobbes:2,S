Some versions of hald do an SG_IO ioctl on the viocd device which becomes
a request with hard_nr_sectors and hard_cur_sectors set to zero.  Passing
zero as the number of sectors to end_request() (which calls
end_that_request_first()) causes an infinite loop when the bio is being
freed.  This patch makes sure that the zero is never passed. It only
requires some number larger the the request size the terminate the loop.
