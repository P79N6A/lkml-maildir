What we really need is a weak external reference which is supported by
the linker for built in objects and by modutils at load time.  Then we
can get rid of run time symbol lookups, get_module_symbol() is an
abomination, especially with versioned symbols.
WEAK_EXTERN(agp_free_memory);
void (*free_memory)(agp_memory *) = &agp_free_memory;
if (free_memory)
	(free_memory)(some_memory);
Nice and clean.  WEAK_EXTERN does some magic to create a NULL pointer
at link time or load time if the symbol is not resolved.
Linus, do you want a patch for this?
