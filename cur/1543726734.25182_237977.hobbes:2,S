the tracer can be killed by oom due some other random app in the
machine, plus SIGCHLD may confuse the tracer, then it needs to know
about arch details again (like the bitmap), and the whole ptrace
infastructure is a lot more complicate and in turn less secure. syscall
performance is the last worry (at least for my usage).
