I agree with this. I made a mistake with the pts vs pty, why not just
help me fix the mistake instead of rejecting everything? Some the of
the info being reported in /proc/tty/drivers is wrong (vc./0 - from
the devfs attempt?). or missing.

I'm not going to solve this problem but it is something that needs to
be discussed. Are we really going to maintain parallel naming schemes,
one in-kernel and one out of kernel? I'm not even sure if USB will
work without udev anymore.
