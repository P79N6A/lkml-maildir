From my limited experience ACPI PM timer just gets the time wrong.
At least psmouse times out much quicker than 4 seconds when resetting
the touchpad which causes many problems.
Looking at the PM timer was on my TODO list ever since it was included
in -mm... I tried installing cpufreq handler to do the same adjustments
for loops_per_jiffy as in timer_pit but I was still getting pretty much
the same result - time goes too quickly.
