Thanks for testing this out :) There does indeed seem to be something wrong
with our mailing list, so thanks for pointing that out too.

It definitely looks like the messages you're getting are due to some nodes
reading old or invalid metadata. If the cache is bad on the other nodes,
re-writing blocks from the same node won't necessarily make things better.

No, it doesn't seem like you're assuming any behavior that it shouldn't be
doing, so there's certainly something wrong going on. I have some
suggestions below. As far as testing goes, we have a pretty fair number of
folks running large production systems on this so I'd definitely say it's
getting tested ;) That said, things can always get temporarily broken,
which is where hearing from folks like you helps alot.

Great. We'll keep things simple at first. If I could get a copy of the
/etc/ocfs2/cluster.conf files from each node that'd be great. A full log of the
OCFS2 messages you see on each node, starting from mount to unmount would also
help. That includes any dlm_* messages - in particular the ones printed when
a node mounts and unmounts. If you're using any mount options it'd be
helpful to know those too.
