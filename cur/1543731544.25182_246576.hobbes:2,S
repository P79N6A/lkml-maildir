If I see it correctly, you want to group a file and some
ancillary files together.
The Unix way would be to make a directory and put them all there:
	xterm/xterm
	xterm/xterm.icon
But you are unsatisfied and want
	xterm
	xterm/xterm.icon
As long as we agree that the latter really means the former,
there are no problems in finding out what should happen.
The conclusion is, that a directory carries an additional bit
that says "if I am opened as a regular file then use the file
of the same name inside".
Now there is no attribute space, just a shorthand.
