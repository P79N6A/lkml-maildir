Somewhat off-topic, but as it both answers your query and is also
interesting to those working on kernel cryptography support, here's a quote
from rsa.com's cryptography FAQ:
   RSA is patented under U.S. Patent 4,405,829, issued September 29, 1983
   and held by RSA Data Security, Inc.; the patent expires 17 years after
   issue, in the year 2000. RSA Data Security has a standard,
   royalty-based licensing policy, which can be modified for special
   circumstances. The U.S. government can use RSA without a license
   because it was invented at MIT with partial government funding.
   In the U.S., a license is needed to make, use or sell RSA. However,
   RSA Data Security usually allows free non-commercial use of RSA, with
   written permission, for academic or university research purposes.
[End of quote].
It is important to note that RSA is only patented in the US. Here, in
Israel, I can use it freely, even in commercial software (ignoring the fact
that the letter of the law here says that I can't use encryption at all
without prior written permission from the authorities. Nobody follows or
enforces that law, though).
