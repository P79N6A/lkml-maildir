I personally think that what would be useful is not "the number of CPUs"
(which does not make any sense), but an enumeration of :
    - the physical nodes (for NUMA)
    - the physical CPUs
    - each CPU's cores (for multi-core)
    - each core's siblings (for HT/SMT)
each of which would report their respective id for {set,get}_affinity().
This way, the application would be able to choose how it needs to spread
over available CPUs depending on its workload. But IMHO, this should
definitely not be put in cpuinfo. I consider that cpuinfo is for the human.

At least it would be simpler with some layout info like above.
Cheers,
