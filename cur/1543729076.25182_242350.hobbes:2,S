does the first xrun happen right during startup, or only when the first
jack application uses jackd to do audio?
if the former then does jackd set itself up (does an mlockall, etc.) 
before it opens the audio device? If the audio device has an event for
jackd the moment the device is opened, and jackd opens the audio device
early during startup, then jackd might not be able to process this event
until it has started up (which can take milliseconds).
