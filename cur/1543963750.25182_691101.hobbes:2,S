This is because the organization of the file was changed, and the linker 
script wasn't changed to match:
SECTIONS
{
         . = HEADER_OFFSET;
         .header : {
                  *(.header)
         }
         . = 0;
         .text : {
                  *(.text*)
         }
This is crap; the sections should be listed *in order* so the linker can 
warn properly when something bad happens.
The code should be correct; reorganizing the linker script correctly 
should fix the problem.
