Never seen VENIX. Never seen that particular mix, and I'm not sure about  
Xenix version numbers - I *think* the ones I saw were lower. Definitely  
included Xenix 286 and 386.
And I didn't see all that much of Netware 2.x.
But considering that our work LAN at one time consisted of a Netware 3.x  
machine, an Interactive Unix machine, and lots of DOS clients remote  
booting from the Novell machine, and the effect of that on _my_ sanity -  
plus what I know about Xenix and NW2 - all I can say is, "who got killed?"
