Jumping backwards is used for every leap second that IERS has ever
done, which was your original comment.  There's has never been a case
where there was a leap second for jump forward though.  The proper
technical term here is 'negative leap second'.  All leap seconds up
until now have been positive leap seconds, and it is unlikely there
ever will be a negative one.
