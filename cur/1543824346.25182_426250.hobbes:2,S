I was also wondering if anyone is working on converting usbvideo to
v4l2. There's also a warning message from videodev that is triggered
by usbvideo's template:
videodev does:
357 #if 1 /* needed until all drivers are fixed */
358         if (!vfd->release)
359                 printk(KERN_WARNING "videodev: \"%s\" has no
release callback. "
360                        "Please fix your driver for proper sysfs
support, see "
361                        "
http://lwn.net/Articles/36850/
\n", vfd->name);
362 #endif
usbvideo does:
958 static const struct video_device usbvideo_template = {
959         .owner =      THIS_MODULE,
960         .type =       VID_TYPE_CAPTURE,
961         .hardware =   VID_HARDWARE_CPIA,
962         .fops =       &usbvideo_fops,
963 };
and so videodev doesn't find .release and complains.
