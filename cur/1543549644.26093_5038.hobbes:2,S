Nope. Solution is to kill the silly "hold super_block lock during the
allocation" completely. Right now the main problem making us use it at all
is the following: dquot_alloc_block() is a blocking operation. If that
gets fixed - that's it. We simply don't need anything more fancy than
rwlock on access to bitmap + rwlock or plain spinlock on access to group
descriptors cache. End of problem.
Remember that off-list thread in July when you asked what could be done
with lock_super()? I did the analysis, all right - list of ext2 races was
a side effect of that. Now we have that crap fixed, so getting rid of
lock_super() in ext2 (in clear way) is possible. So if you still want it -
tell. ext2 part is very easy, it's quota part that needs serious work.
