I think chances are actually quite good we'll be able to proceed with
pushing the ACPI table re-write immediately upon 2.6.21 open.
Note that while it is sort of big text-wise, it isn't that complicated --
and failures in this type of code tend to be massively obvious boot failures.
Note also that  2.6.20-rc6-mm3 is not the maiden voyage to -mm for this code.
It has been there several times before as it has matured.
The table re-write broke the HP simulator -- but I think we can fix that quickly.
I don't know yet what broke the HP rx2600.
The sysfs branch is what broke the button and the Altix boot.
Sysfs may or may not go upstream at 2.6.21 open -- but that isn't
the code you are conflicting with here so that is moot.
cheers,
