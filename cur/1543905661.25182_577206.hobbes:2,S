To inform the vendor and to post a warning about the issue on lkml was
the right thing to do. It is the wording of your post that obviously
irked some people.

The commit message could have been better. The correct thing to say
would have been "Nobody in the official kernel is using
ptep_test_and_clear_dirty and ptep_clear_flush_dirty."
nvidia will have to adapt their binary driver. This is not the first
time it breaks and it won't be the last time. We do not really have a
problem and we should all calm down and put that issue to rest.
