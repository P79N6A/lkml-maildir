The current elf_header solution does not grant *any* privledges just is
used to revoke them. elf_headers should never be used to grant privledges
that we can agree on.

I have heard that said as well, If I recall correctly it involved reading
in the whole file into some kind of temp memory buffer. that dies when
program ends. The script would be invoked with foo
/proc/self/my_script_image instead of foo /bin/some-suid-file
Maybe even that is unworkable. Anyway you can embed most scripting
languages anyway like perl or python so I don't really care.
Just make a wrapper that doesn't even read yet another file.
With fmemopen or open_memstream like thing that made fd's instead of
streams one could probably make one size fit all in place wrapper.

Again we won't store rights in the files, only denials.

I know that is not what I want. Store restrictions.

The elf_header can transform a root into another user with only a subset
of the power... Or a root with only a subset of the full power.
I am about to release a patch based on one by Pavel.
I'd like someone who hates it to really try ripping into it.
