The public key is available from 
http://www.kernel.org/signature.html
To quote the page:
Files placed in the Linux Kernel Archives are automatically PGP-signed by
the archive. This signature can be used to prove that a file, which may
have been obtained from a mirror site or other location, really originated
at the Linux Kernel Archives. 
The current Linux Kernel Archives PGP key is always posted here, including
any revocation certificates which may be outstanding on older keys. 
This URL is also included in the comments of all the .sign files
Thanks.
