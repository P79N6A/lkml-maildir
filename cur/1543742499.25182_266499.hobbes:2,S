IIRC, Rui was running with -p128, which at 48000kHz is 2600usecs (and
longer at 44100kHz). If the maximum process cycle was on the order of
1500usecs, that leaves nearly 1ms until the next interrupt is
due. Unless jackd was held up between computing the process cycle time
and entering poll, it doesn't seem that the process cycle ever gets
close to the interrupt interval duration.
So I don't think that delays caused *during* jackd's processing cycle
are involved here. However, I agree that your suggestion to check for
this before computing max_delay is probably wise in general.
