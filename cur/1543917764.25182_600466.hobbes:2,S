i think if you are relatively sure that the box does not have any real 
3D hardware in it (supported by X) then glxgears will interact badly 
with X and can cause such symptoms. In that case glxgears 'spams' the X 
server with requests and everyone else suffers from that. The fair-group 
scheduler indeed could shift CPU usage of X just enough (in X's favor!) 
that might trigger such problems. Such "spam X" workloads often react in 
a paradoxial way: a scheduler that gives X _more_ CPU time will appear 
to be "less interactive".)
