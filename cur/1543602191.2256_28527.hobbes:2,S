I'm sorry, but that's not acceptable.
Please note the dd timings at the bottom of this message.
This is consistant with real workload on my and other peoples systems, 
200-300MB+ files, clear up to 1GB+ files are at times ROUTINE for 
writing. This is esspecialy applicable if dealing with disk images, etc.
Disabling write cache creates times that are twice as large or more 
than WITH write cache. Unless the system or drive has a serious, 
SPECIFIC fault with its write cache, disabling it can cause an 
unacceptable performance hit.
Yes, a typical desktop user isn't going to notice much, even a normal 
webserver or fileserver not dealing with constant updates may not, but 
certain workloads will. These workloads are real enough that telling 
people to disable write caching out of hand is a bad idea.
There's no way in hell I'm going to accept having my performance cut in 
half or more on my daily workload due to the remote possibility that 
something may happen to my data/filesystem in mid-write. That's what 
the cheap little UPS sitting beside my desk that gives me ample time to 
power down is for.
Short of a catastrophic power supply, motherboard, or other component 
failure (which often stands a good chance of destroying the drive 
anyway), a power failure is the main problem here.
Keep in mind also, that you may be putting your data and filesystems in 
more risk by not using a write cache as with using it.
