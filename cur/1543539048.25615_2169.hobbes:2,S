I've had this sort of thing happen to me when I didn't re-run lilo (or
other boot loader) after doing make install, even if the kernel is in the
same physical location.  I assumed that it had something to do with the
starting offset in the kernel changing, but this is just a wild stab by a
newbie. (Why does this happen in reality?)
Good luck!
