Eww.  Let me find a way to fix that.  It may be as simple as detecting
the required fixmap relocation first, then initializing VMI later, when
we can parse options, but it will need testing...
Thanks for the quick response, I realize it is late in the 2.6.28-rc
phase here and I will send an updated fix tomorrow.
