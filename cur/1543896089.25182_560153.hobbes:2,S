You're right. I went back in history and it was me who introduced the 
_GNU_SOURCE when I added the memmem too (shame on me). So, if it worked 
fine before, there is no reason to not work now that memmem is removed.
So I can:
  - send an incremental patch with just that line removed
  - send a replacement patch
  - just leave it for now and wait until I work on kallsyms again to 
silently remove that line together with other changes
Andrew, what would you prefer?
