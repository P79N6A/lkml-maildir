Yuck.  The problem here is the space in the interface name, which the
sysfs code chokes on.  The code just does
	sscanf(buffer, "%16s", command); /* IFNAMSIZ*/
and goes from there.  Because of the space, it only gets the first half of
the interface name.
Suggestions?  Do we just omit the sscanf and copy up to the newline (or
EOF)?  Should there be another delimiter here?
Are spaces allowed in interface names anyway?  I can't believe that
bonding is the only area affected by this.

BTW this will also break if you try to add/remove a slave with a space in
the name through sysfs.
