I've repeated the above statements so many times to a number of the
anti-virus companies, and other people that really should know better,
that I'm really sick of it.  For some reason, they keep trying to do
things like this in the kernel, despite it being trivial to do in
userspace properly.
In the end, I even got one company to agree that it should be done in
userspace (McAfee), but they ignored this and went off to update their
kernel code again :(
Just because other operating systems require you to do things like this
within the kernel, doesn't mean that you have to do the same thing on
Linux...
so sad,
