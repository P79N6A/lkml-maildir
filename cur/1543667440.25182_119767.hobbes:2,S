Its on the crash trolley right now, but we think we may be able to save
the patient. The registration is saner now for PCI but not for the non
PCI cases. In addition the resource allocation is ass backwards and that
I will change at some point so the caller does the resource work.
PC9800 requires this really, PCMCIA badly needs it, and it lets me
remove a ton of hacks from the mmio aware drivers.
