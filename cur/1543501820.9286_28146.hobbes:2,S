Have done, and there I found stat(5):
another new one S_ISCDF(m)    test for a context-dependent file
                S_ISNWK(m)    test for a network special
chmod(2) doesn't say much interesting except mentioning ACLs.
stat(2) mentions ACLs and Multi-Level Directories.
ls(1) says "n" is the character for a network special file.
"+" is displayed if there are ACLs, and ACLs don't work over NFS.
chmod(1) has -A to preserve optional ACL entries, that fails on
filesystems that don't support ACLs.  chmod(1) has nothing else
interesting.

It'd be nice to know which ones.
