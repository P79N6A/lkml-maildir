Synchronization promitives work as expected. Otherwise openvz'd be buried in bugs
all over the map.
Core cpufreq has per-cpu array of rw-semaphores but the index of
semaphore one want to down comes from userspace not from number of CPU
process is executing virtual or physical.
Probably davej could say something.
