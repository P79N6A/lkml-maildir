eh.  We put the recursive-sem thing in there as a temp fix to cpufreq to
get 2.6.something out the door, expressing fine intentions to fix it for
real later on.  Then look what happened.  Don't go there.

Well actually when struct mutex went in we decided to remove all
non-counting uses of semaphores kernel-wide, migrating them to mutexes. 
Then to remove all the arch-specific semaphore implementations and
implement an arch-neutral version.  After that has been done would be an
appropriate time to rename things.
But it never happened.  See "fine intentions", above ;)
