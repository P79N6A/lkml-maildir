Ok, I found out why this is happening -- the v850 default linker
scripts, for whatever reason, merge any section called `.gnu.linker.t*'
with .text.
I can prevent this by adding the option `--unique=.gnu.linkonce.this_module'
to the linker flags (specifically, to LDFLAGS_MODULE in the top-level
Makefile).  I suppose another way to do it would be to rename the
section something that doesn't match `.gnu.linker.t*'.
What's the right way to handle this?
[from perusing the ld srcs, a few other archs seem to have the same
`feature,' though the only that I think has linux support is `cris']
Thanks,
