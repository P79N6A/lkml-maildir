Ah yes, of course you're right, I was misremembering: thanks.

Mmm, yes, I hadn't noticed that one: rather a weird case.
(If root had a mind to do so, she could be flipping compat_vdso
back and forth on all cpus concurrently; but I don't see an actual
problem of getting a worse outcome than she deserves for doing so -
the pages involved never get freed.)

I'd have thought it better done just in that one peculiar case,
with a comment that it's to keep Xen happy; but I'd better back
out now and leave it to you and Ingo.
