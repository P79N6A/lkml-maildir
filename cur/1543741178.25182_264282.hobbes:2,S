 The problem is that, in devparam, a devparam_def and accordingly any
wrapping argument structure is shared by more than one users (e.g. a
dev paramset_def is used by all devices attached to the particular
driver).  And, making matters complicated, bus and class
paramset_def's can even be accessed concurrently.
 As we need to adjust pointers in wrapping structures to point to
specific fields in each allocated paramsets, wrapping arguments are
copied and fixed up everytime it's used (so the arg_copy_size and
arg_fixups fields in struct device_paramset_def).  i.e. wrapping
arguments are transient.  They can contain extra read-only information
to describe the parameter to the driver-model but cannot contain any
information the other way around.  Consequently, adding num field to
struct param_array wouldn't work for devparam.

 I think, for a user who's willing to make use of the number of set
elements, requiring to supply the number field is okay.
