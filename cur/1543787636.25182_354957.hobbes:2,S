Luben has more than once called for adding a small number of
additional calls to the existing SCSI core.  These calls would
implement the new (reduced) functionallity.  The old calls would
continue to support the full SPI functionallity.  No existing  LLDD
would need modification.
Then, over time, more radical restructuring could be done that pulls
SPI out of SCSI core.
I believe this proposal is what he was talking about, not the brand
new simplified SCSI core that has been discussed recently in this
thread.
