The other alternative which addresses the security concern is
data=journal, which if you have a big enough journal, can sometimes be
*faster* than data=ordered or even data=writeback, because it reduces
seeking.  The problem is that it's workload dependent which is better;
if the workload is very, very heavy on data writes, each data block
ends up getting writen twice, once to the journal and once to the
final location on disk, and so this halves your total max write
bandwidth.  But if the workload doesn't do as much writing, and is
very seeky, and or is very, very, fsync()-centric (like a mailhub),
data=journal is probably the right answer.
