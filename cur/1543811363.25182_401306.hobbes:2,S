I wonder that a lot of people use promise sata 300 tx4. i have lots of 
problems, i always get scsi-errors. now i changed to other harddisk. i use 
seagate, which is on the compatibility-list of this card. so why is it not 
working in my computer. i use kernel 2.6.15. what else can be wrong? I 
have a intel serverboard with dual p3 with 440gx-chipset.
The driver from promise does not compile. Someone out there who got it 
running? What to do?
any idea?
