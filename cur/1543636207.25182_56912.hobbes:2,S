I'm trying to get MIDI synth happening with the Ali M5451 audio chipset
(as found in the Toshiba 1800 notebook).
So far, it appears to me that:
* linux-2.2 has MIDI support in the code (v0.14.5c of trident.c) - but
this driver (a) doesn't work for basic audio[1] and (b) doesn't register a
MIDI synth device (and MIDI players complain of no device).
* linux-2.4 has no MIDI support in the code (v0.14.9d of trident.c) - this
driver works OK for basic audio.  Oddly, I can't see any mention of the
MIDI code removal in the driver's history.
* ALSA-0.9 - no MIDI support in the code (alsa-kernel/pci/ali5451/*).
Have I missed something here?
Thanks,
Neale.
[1] "doesn't work for basic audio" includes this being logged to kern.log:
	trident: drain_dac, dma timeout?
Interestingly, I can make this go away by first loading and unloading the
ALSA drivers then loading the OSS drivers.  This makes me suspicious that
linux-2.2's OSS driver is missing something in the initialisation.
