How very odd.  I've now understood what was happening (see other
post), but I'm not sure what could reverse the situation.  Can you
download the test tarball again - I've put up an updated version which
pretouches the pages and gives some extra info.  Running it both with
and without pretouch would be interesting (#if 0/1 in matmul.h to
change).
