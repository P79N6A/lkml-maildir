Why not? Granted, many of the filesystems in the Linux kernel don't enforce that 
they have unique st_ino values, but I'm working on a set of patches to try and 
fix that.

This sounds like a bug to me. It seems like we should have a one to one 
correspondence of filehandle -> inode. In what situations would this not be the 
case?
