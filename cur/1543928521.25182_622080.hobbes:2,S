irqs_disabled_flags() gives us a nonessential bit of the trace output:
                 _------=> CPU#
                / _-----=> irqs-off
               | / _----=> need-resched
               || / _---=> hardirq/softirq
               ||| / _--=> preempt-depth
               |||| /
               |||||     delay
   cmd     pid ||||| time  |   caller
      \   /    |||||   \   |   /
 privoxy-12926 1.Ns1    0us : ktime_get_ts (ktime_get)
 privoxy-12926 1.Ns1    0us : getnstimeofday (ktime_get_ts)
 privoxy-12926 1.Ns1    1us : set_normalized_timespec (ktime_get_ts)
 privoxy-12926 1.Ns1    1us : rb_first (htb_dequeue)
it's the 'irqs-off' flag, which is 'd', 'D' or '.'.
so you can define irqs_off_flags to always-0 and you should be able to 
get pretty good traces still. It should have no functional impact.
