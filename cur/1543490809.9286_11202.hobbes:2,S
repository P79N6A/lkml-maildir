You really have to justify that statement!  
All the get_queue() mechanism does is allow a completely general-purpose
IO clustering mechanism to be used at a granularity which suits the
driver concerned.  For IDE, that may mean more than one queue per
major.  For SCSI, it might actually mean one queue for more than one
major.  The same generic IO sorting and clustering works on both,
whatever notion of queue the driver itself happens to desire.
The fact that it works in such a flexible manner seems to me to be an
indication that it is actually doing something right.
