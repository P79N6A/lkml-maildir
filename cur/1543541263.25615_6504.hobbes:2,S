Unfortunately a typedef alone won't even issue a warning for code which
uses the "sane type" directly.
IMO nice would be a really opaque cookie, s.t. readl is passed the
cookie _and_ offset.  That also leaves the way open for lots of
different implementation methods for readl et al., including debugging
checks, range and I/O tracing.  (E.g. I've seen drivers access ports
outside their allocated range, due to typos).
Many drivers use a struct to define the offsets in their I/O or iomem
space.  E.g. acenic.c: readl(&regs->CpuCtrl).  We know that's not
portable in the sense that struct layout is not guaranteed.  However,
provided all the fields are suitably padded & aligned, it works in
practice.  (So far..)
Those drivers will compile with the simplest void * -> unsigned long
change, but it will be lots of work to get rid of all the warnings.
