I think that the problem is that HPET and the CMOS RTC (list in CC)
share the same interrupt line.
I suppose that you should enable CONFIG_HPET_RTC_IRQ (my hardware has
the same "feature"); in this way /dev/rtc correcly reports that it
cannot deliver the interrupt (when HPET is enabled) and hwclock uses
direct ISA access.
