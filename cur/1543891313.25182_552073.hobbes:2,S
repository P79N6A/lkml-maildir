A cond call is essentially a fancy variable. And the Linux kernel
is written in C and in C you declare variables before you use them.
Also it would allow compile time checking against typos and 
allow removing some nasty hash table code. The proposal sounds like a 
clear winner to me.

In one of them. Like all other variables in C.
