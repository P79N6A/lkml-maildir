Hi,
  my Dell Latitude CPi 300XT seems to have a few problems booting. The
  usual sequence after power-on is:
 boot#1 -- VFS panic at mount / stage (IBM IDE disk is detected properly
            a few steps before)
 boot#2 -- boot completes but IDE CDROM isn't detected (!!)
 boot#3 -- everything is fine
Using latest BIOS (A04) from Dell's site. Happens on vanilla 2.2.9 and
 vanilla 2.3.[45].
I am using RH6.0 and dual-booting NT workstation 4.0sp3 (NT boots okay
 whatever condition -- it can't work with the Xircom RBEM56G-100, at
 least for now, while Linux can, but it boots fine).
Any idea of what I should check/try ?
[unrelated: copy_kernel_strings should be exported in 2.3.5 to allow
 binfmt_misc to load as module]
Cheers,
