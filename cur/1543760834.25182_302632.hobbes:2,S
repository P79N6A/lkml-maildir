I don't think I can push that upstream.  What happens if you leave
that out?
More generally, we are making a user-visible change, even for programs
that aren't marked as having non-executable stack or heap, because we
are now enforcing that the program can't execute from mappings that
don't have PROT_EXEC.  Perhaps we should enforce the requirement for
execute permission only on those programs that indicate somehow that
they can handle it?
Paul.
