Well actually, the neighbour alive discovery done by arp influences the
routing cache very much. Therefore recent Linux networking is actually able to
send "Host unreachable" messages based on the fact, that an host is down.
You are right, that it is not closely related, but it is something one should
not forget, since it is a behaviour introduced in 2.2 kernels, I think.
You can check it with "ip neig". Entries which have an unreachable host are
marked with "nud failed".
