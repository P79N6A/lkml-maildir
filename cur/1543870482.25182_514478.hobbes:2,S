Looks like I should grab these testcases for the sake of due diligence
(not to say I intend to alter maintenance style from primarily review,
approval, and bugfixing, not that I've been doing as much of any of those
as I should). To which architectures and/or distributions have the
userspace bits been ported, or otherwise run/tested on? A quick sniff
test on an Altix suggests SLES and/or ia64 may trip up the scripts:
$ su -c "make check"
Password:
         VERSION
	 ./run_tests.sh: line 1: get_hugetlbfs_path: command not found
	 run_tests.sh: unable to find hugetlbfs mountpoint
	 make: *** [check] Error 1
