secureexec will return true even if you have whatever cap you want the user 
to have for this to work.
What use to you see for having this flag survive setuid?  The only (safe) 
use I can see is for debugging, in which case just copying the binary and 
running it non-setuid should be OK.
In this case, then secureexec is a better test than setuid-ness because of 
LSMs (like SELinux) in which case setuid is not the only way that security 
can be elevated.
