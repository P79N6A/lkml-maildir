Linus does take patches to the MAINTAINERS file from time to time. (:
In my opinion, the L: entries of MAINTAINERS ought to have URLs for
list archives, where available:
  L: sound-list@redhat.com, <URL:
http://www.xxxxxxx
>
Perhaps archive URLs should be on W: lines but I think the L: lines are
appropriate -- keep related information together.
