Hi Mathieu,
Thank you for test ideas.
I made both of above two tests and run it. Both test modules
do NOT cause memory corruption...

Should both of them have PAGE_SIZE*2?

Hmm, when I ran above code, it hit the last BUG_ON().
I checked that somedata[i] didn't updated.

However, when I ran kprobe-based test, it doesn't hit the BUG_ON()
in text_poke().

I haven't seen vmalloc failure message on 2.6.29-rc2.
Thank you again,
