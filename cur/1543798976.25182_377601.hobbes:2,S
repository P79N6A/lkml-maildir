Some of the counters can be accessed at interrupt time and these are meant 
to be right. Next rev adds another racy version of the counters that will 
be used for the optional VM counters. Those counters will benefit from 
inc/dec if generated by the compiler.

On a counter by counter basis one could use the __ functions that do not 
disable interrupts.

That will be part of the next rev that I am currently testing.
