calling schedule() isn't a lot of use either.
If CONFIG_PREEMPT it's of no benefit and will just chew CPU.
If !CONFIG_PREEMPT && !need_resched() then it's a no-op and will chew CPU.
If !CONFIG_PREEMPT && need_resched() then yes, it'll schedule away.  This
is pretty much the only time that a simple schedule() is useful.
What are we actually trying to do in here?
