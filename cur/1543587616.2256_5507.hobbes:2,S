I'm not sure of that.  Sometimes keys get "stuck" in the down position
with my USB keyboard (mechanical switches, so the keys themselves are not
sticking) and usually when that happens I can find a line like the one
quoted above in the logs.  Also, occasionally my mouse goes black (one of
the optical Logitech's) with a similar line and must be disconnected and
reconnected to work again.  Again, similar line in the logs.
Nothing fatal happens.  Pressing another key fixes the keyboard and my old
fashioned USB ball mouse ;) works fine.

I've seen similar suggestions for people with AMD-based systems.
