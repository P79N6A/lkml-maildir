Subject: Re: [PATCH] rename CONFIG_VOYAGER to CONFIG_X86_VOYAGER

Actually this one won't link because of an unmodified CONFIG_VOYAGER in 
hw_irq.h
However, I think this #if needs modifying according to the attached patch, 
anyway.  I think it's obviously correct, but can someone with an APIC based 
SMP system test this, please.
