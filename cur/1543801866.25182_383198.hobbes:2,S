I can't speak to the correctness of that code but your understanding of
strncmp() is incorrect. From "GNU C Library Application Fundamentals":
    This function is the [sic] similar to strcmp, except that no more
    than size wide characters are compared. In other words, if the two
    strings are the same in their first size wide characters, the return
    value is zero.
And this has been may experience for the past 20 years and is confirmed by
this trivial program which prints zero in both cases:
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("%d\n", strncmp("abc","abcd",3));
    printf("%d\n", strncmp("abcd","abc",3));
}
