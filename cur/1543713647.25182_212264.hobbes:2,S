I forgot to mention another patch along these lines:

This gives you output like this:
 ttyS0 at MMIO 0xf8030000 (HCDP PCI 0000:e0:01.1, irq = 49) is a 16550A
 ttyS1 at MMIO 0xf8031000 (PCI 0000:e0:01.0, irq = 49) is a 16550A
 ttyS2 at MMIO 0xf8030010 (PCI 0000:e0:01.1, irq = 49) is a 16550A
 ttyS3 at MMIO 0xf8030038 (PCI 0000:e0:01.1, irq = 49) is a 16550A
 ttyS4 at MMIO 0xff5e0000 (ACPI SER0, irq = 67) is a 16550A
 
so you have a clue about what ports are on what cards.  There wasn't
any interest at the time, though.
