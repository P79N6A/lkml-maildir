Subject: x86_64: 2.6.14 with NUMA panics at boot

With CONFIG_K8_NUMA I get the following right after boot:
PANIC: early exception rip ffffffff8023429f error 0 cr2 0
PANIC: early exception rip ffffffff8011893a error 0 cr2 ffffffffff5fd023
Looking at the System.map 8023429f seems to be find_first_bit
and 80118993a safe_smp_processor_id. When I compile kernel without
K8 NUMA it boots fine but eg. ATI Radeon driver doesn work.
Board I'm using is Tyan S2885 with two Opteron 246's and 4GB ram.
