Yes, you're right. I'll fix that and send an updated version.

Fair.

Then it isn't dput_locked() anymore and you have to manually dereference
before you use __dput_locked(). Doesn't sound better. I'll give it a try ...

Yes, I totally missed the locking issue here. I'll rework that one.

Hmm, will think about that one again. shrink_dcache_parent() and
shrink_dcache_memory()/dput() are not racing against each other now since the
reference counting is done before giving up dcache_lock and the select_parent
could start.
