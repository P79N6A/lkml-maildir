If the filesystem is marked clean, does that mean that people with
journalling file systems are fscked? (since there might be no journal entry
of what hasn't finished.)
just guessing, I don't know how these work, but if ext2 gets the 'clean' bit
set, i can imagine the journaling file systems refusing to check anything...
