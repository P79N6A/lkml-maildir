That's correct.

This I completely agree with, and have this on my TODO for quite a long 
time. If Li Yu would like to spend some time on it, it certainly would 
help. The current "simple HID interrface" is a suitable workaround for 
various buggy/broken/nonstandard hardware which is currently not handled 
by the HID kernel code properly, but it's definitely not a long-term 
solution that should go to mainline.

Unfortunately there is a non-trivial bunch of hardware that pretends to be 
standard keyboard/mouse, but behaves badly. Last week I had to do 
workaround for Logitech S510, which seems to generate usages far above the 
logical maximum specified in report descriptor, to give one example.
So we will probably end up with many small driver for exotic pieces of 
hardware being registered to the hid bus. But this is definitely much 
better than the current mess of hid quirks.

That's right. We could always extend the quirks so that it's long long, or 
something like that, but this is also not sustainable in the long term.
