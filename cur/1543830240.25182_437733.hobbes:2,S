Subject: [PATCH 001 of 12] md: Possible fix for unplug problem
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I have reports of a problem with raid5 which turns out to be because
the raid5 device gets stuck in a 'plugged' state.  This shouldn't be
able to happen as 3msec after it gets plugged it should get unplugged.
However it happens none-the-less.  This patch fixes the problem and is
a reasonable thing to do, though it might hurt performance slightly in
some cases.
Until I can find the real problem, we should probably have this
workaround in place.
