That's a separate issue, which we haven't discussed yet.  We have a device
which has gone away and which might come back later on.  Presently we will
return an I/O error if I/O is attempted in that window.  Obviously we'll
need to do something different, such as block reads and block or defer writes.
So an overall picture would be something like:
- When device is not present, reads block and writes are deferred or block
- When device appears (at a new point in the namespace) the hotplug
  scripts will go off and will identify it and will apply some policy based
  upon that identification.  That policy could be one of:
  a) accept device at its new address
  b) accept device at its new address, abandon the old address (all
     those blocked reads and writes suddenly return -EIO).
  c) remove device from its new address, splice it back to where it
     used to be, permit those blocked reads and writes to proceed.
- For devices which are absent-and-blocked, provide some ability for both
  a timeout and manual cancellation, to unblock all those readers and
  writers, make them get -EIO.
The number of potential races is, of course, huge.
