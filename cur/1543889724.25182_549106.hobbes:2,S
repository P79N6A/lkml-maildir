Subject: [BUG] Dropping fragmented IP packets within VLAN frames on bridge

There is a problem with fragmented IP packet sent within 802.1Q tagged
ethernet frame through bridge. Problem exists when conntrack is enabled
(i.e. nf_conntrack_ipv4 module is loaded). Then, such packets are not
fragmented again (after prior reassembling on bridge device) during
passing it to bridge enslaved NIC. It cause MTU exceeding and as a result
dropping packet.
Problem exists from kernel version 2.6.17 to 2.6.21.3 inclusive.
Below, there is a patch to fix it.
Regards.
