Here's an even better idea.
Let's do the assignment internally in the kernel, but just not write it to 
the device unless it's actually enabled. IOW, we'll be doing all the 
resource allocation, but devices won't be affected. Modern lspci versions 
will show this as a "[virtual] Expansion ROM".
The patch might look something like this. Helge, does this make any 
difference?
Ivan, opinions?
