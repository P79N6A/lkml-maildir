Could someone elaborate on this please?
If my client does
  big_map = mmap(... some file ...)
  make_dirty(big_map)
  msync(first half of big_map)
  msync(second half of big_map)    { crash during this }
Then I am guaranteed that (unless the server crashes), the first half of
big_map *will* have reached the server, but not that all of the second
half has.   Right?
Like any local-disk backed file.
Ignoring the case where the NFS *server* crashes, where could the write
ordering differ, compared to local disk files ?
In other words, what does Benjamin's "unexpected ways" refer to ?
Thanks,
