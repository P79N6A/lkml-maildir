Some time ago there was a proposal that would allow appropriate
handling of these sorts of things.
Accessors to packet headers would go through a macro, and this
along with some other defines would allow an architecture to
decide between two schemes:
1) Use normal loads and stores, let trap handler take care of
   unaligned cases.
2) Use something akin to get_unaligned(), no trap handler stuff.
Sure, to make things faster we can do something like this PPP
patch, but it needs lots of work, first of all you need to
replace this:
	for ( ... )
		p[i-1] = p[i];
stuff with a proper memmove() call.
