Subject: [PATCH] Terminate i386 local APIC DMI exception table
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

[sending directly to Linus because Andrew said he is away] 
The i386 local APIC DMI exception table was not 0 terminated. The dmi
parser would walk into random .data space. Found during code review,
not known to cause problems, but should be still fixed.  I checked all
other DMI tables and they seemed to be ok.
