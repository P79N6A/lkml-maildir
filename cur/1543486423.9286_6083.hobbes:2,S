Sure, the requirement is recursive till you get to the filesystem's root.

I'm presuming that I could have a way of recognizing when I'm doing a
lookup on a directory that has already been examined, and that I can at
that point skip any further examination of the children of that directory.
I guess that means that I'd have to normalize each path to match the
way I'm pruning things.. which kinda trashes the idea of a cache.

Why?  Maybe I'm getting into hot water here, but can't you just get
away with the existing "one dcache entry for the path you're looking
up" mechanism?
Or are you refering to the limitations of a normalization-for-comparison
scheme?

Eh?
I can see that you need the rename lock for rename.
I can see that you need it to link directories.
I don't see that you need it for readdir.
I don't see that you need it for mkdir.
I don't see that you need it for stat.
I'm not sure whether you'd need it for rmdir.
I'm assuming that when you hold/release the rename lock that you're
not in the middle of a lookup, but that you can do lookups while you
hold that lock.
I guess this would throttle directory rename, but I don't see that this
would be a noticable effect.  There's probably a way to not have to
throttle rmdir.  No one cares if you throttle the creation of hard
links to directories [because "compared to what?"].
