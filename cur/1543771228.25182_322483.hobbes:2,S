There are more switch devices to be added. That is, each vendor has
their own way to set/get route table entries.  This approach makes it
easy to add a fooswitch.c without adding an entry to a separate constant
table as we support additional switches (at least 5 vendors so far). I
originally  looked at how PCI was using a section for quirks and figured
that was OK to copy. I can see how PCI might justify it a bit more since
it is allowing arch-specific quirks to be registered without modifying
a generic PCI table of quirks.  If it's a concern, I can make a constant
table but it's not as nice IMHO.
FWIW, I was going to expand usage of RIO-specific sections a bit more,
so I'd like to see what the consensus is on using sections to generate
tables at build time.  Specifically, support for MMIO regions requires
node specific operations (specific to each vendor device) as RIO
neglected to standardize something like BARs a la PCI. My intention
was to put some device-specific ops to get the size of active MMIO
regions etc. with the same approach as the switch ops.

I'll drop those.

That was to control debug info per-file, but can be changed.  It's
debugged to a certain level, but some network configuration are
going to expose corner cases that I haven't noticed while testing
with 2-3 boards on the 1st gen hardware. Same reason there are still
debug statements riddled throughout the PCI code...there's always
more bugs. :)

Ok, will do.

That was supposed to be removed as I don't yet have a use for it.
I'll remove it.

It is taken outside of rio-scan.c while searching lists so it can't
be static. The name does suck, though. I'll change it to something
like that.
