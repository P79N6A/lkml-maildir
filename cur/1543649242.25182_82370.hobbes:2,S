SMP machines have the APIC enabled by default.  Hence the problem sounds like 
it's (at least being triggered by) the APIC code.

Dunno.  The boxen I currently manage are UP (cheaper that way), so I don't 
actually need the APIC, so I switched it off and life went on.  Alan Cox 
seems to be of the opinion that bios bugs are involved, which should come as 
no surprise. :)
