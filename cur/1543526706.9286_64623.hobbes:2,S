That is true.  I never exercised that code.  Yes, that code would have
oopsed later when the second module was unloaded.  But the second module
has not been unloaded.  Both modules are there.
The oops happens in code that works fine in the first module. It has
been transplanted into the second module and both modules are loaded. 
I've been doing some more experiments and some thinking.
I don't see how the compiler can avoid giving possibly overlapping
addresses to constant data in different modules. It doesn't know
about the other module. So it must be up to modprobe to remap ...
.. and how can modprobe guarantee to avoid overlaps? It would need
to check the whole map of kernel data structures. Surely it can't
do that reliably? It would have to follow a heuristic rather than
a algorithm for mapping areas, no?
I would almost suspect that modutils don't expect constant data
of more than one page in size. Is that it?
