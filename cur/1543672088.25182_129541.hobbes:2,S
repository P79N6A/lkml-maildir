Followups to this message will  include patches with the core
of a "USB Gadget" framework.  As you know, this is something
we've wanted for the 2.5 kernel.  I see this as a good seed,
the Linux developer community as fertile ground, and with
spring here (Northern hemisphere, y'all), it's time to see
what we'll grow!
The API is hardware-neutral, and passes straight down to drivers
for device-side USB controllers.  The "gadget drivers" implement
USB device functionality using that API, including "endpoint zero"
policies to configure that hardware for the desired functionality.
They talk to host-side USB device drivers, such as those found
today in all mainstream Linux kernels.
       1 <linux/usb_gadget.h> ... API, and inlined implementation.
       2 drivers/usb/gadget/net2280.[hc] ... implements that API,
         for the Net2280 peripheral controller.  This connects
         using PCI, and supports USB 2.0 high speed.  So it's
         relatively demanding of that API.
       3 drivers/usb/gadget/zero.c  ... simple gadget driver for
         testing
       4 drivers/usb/gadget/ether.c  ... CDC Ethernet gadget driver,
         supports high speed link
       5 drivers/usb/gadget/usbstring.c ... optional utility code,
         for use by gadget drivers
       6 kconfig/kbuild support for all the above.
These patches are against 2.5.68 current.  Please merge them
towards Linus' tree.
