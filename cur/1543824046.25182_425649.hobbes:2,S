Well that's a crock, isn't it?
Peter, does this fix it?
From: Andrew Morton <akpm@osdl.org>
pdflush is carefully designed to ensure that all wakeups have some
corresponding work to do - if a woken-up pdflush thread discovers that it
hasn't been given any work to do then this is considered an error.
That all broke when swsusp came along - because a timer-delivered wakeup to a
frozen pdflush thread will just get lost.  This causes the pdflush thread to
get lost as well: the writeback timer is supposed to be re-armed by pdflush in
process context, but pdflush doesn't execute the callout which does this.
Fix that up by ignoring the return value from try_to_freeze(): jsut proceed,
see if we have any work pending and only go back to sleep if that is not the
case.
