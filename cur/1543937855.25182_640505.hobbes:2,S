No :)
What I'm saying is that the times could be left un-updated for a long
time if program doesn't do munmap() or msync(MS_SYNC) for a long time.
If program has this pattern:
mmap()
write to map
msync(MS_ASYNC)
sleep(long)
write to map
msync(MS_ASYNC)
sleep(long)
...
Then we'd never see time updates (until the program exits, but that
could be years).
Maybe this doesn't matter, I'm just saying this is a disadvantage
compared to the "update on first dirtying" approach, which would
ensure, that times are updated at least once per 30s.
