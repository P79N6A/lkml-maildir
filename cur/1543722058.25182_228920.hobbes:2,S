Andrew, the patch in the URL looks fine to me, it adds support for 
Netmos 9835 based cards. Tim Waugh ACKed the 2.4 version of the patch. 
Christopher Lameter updated the patch for v2.6, and it looks 
alright to me. Please check the URL.
Quoting him:
"Attached a patch to support a variety of PCI based serial and parallel
port I/O ports (typically labeled 222N-2 or 9835). The patch was
I just fixed it up and made it work for 2.6.0-test10/10.
I think this should go into 2.6.0 since it has been out there for a long
time and is just some additional driver support that somehow fell through
the cracks in 2.4.X. Tim Waugh submitted it in the 2.4.X series."
I'm sure the fellows in this thread who posses the cards 
can give it a test.
