it's an issue only when the GPIO is an interrupt source and the
trigger condition is set to both rising and falling.  but i guess your
point is that in gpio_get_value(), we can check to see if these
conditions are met and if so, temporarily fiddle things there ?
Michael: that sounds reasonable, what do you think ?
