Umm? The above doesn't really make sense.
We can take a page fault on the kernel region with the lazy page
directory filling, but that code will just set the PGD entry and exit
without taking any lock at all. So it basically ends up being an
"invisible" event.
Now, if an interrupt handler accesses kernel memory that just isn't
there, that has _always_ taken a page fault, and that case is not new to
2.4.x. In that case you would take the exception table lock, but that is
true in both 2.2.x and in 2.4.x.
