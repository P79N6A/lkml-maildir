AppArmor doesn't actually provide confinement, because it only operates on 
filesystem objects.
What you define in AppArmor policy does _not_ reflect the actual 
confinement properties of the policy.  Applications can simply use other 
mechanisms to access objects, and the policy is effectively meaningless.
You might define this as a non-technical issue, but the fact that AppArmor 
simply does not and can not work is a fairly significant consideration, I 
would imagine.
