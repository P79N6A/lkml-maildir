Steve,
   I'll give it a try. I am pretty sure it's a distro specific issue
so I'm going to check with them about how to properly configure sshd.
It's likely jsut some oversight in one of my config files. Being a
Gentoo user we have more things like this that we have to look after.
Probably some update clobbered something and I just noticed it
recently.
   If I get a quick minute I'll build the 2.6.23 and take a look at that also.
Thanks,
Mark
