Oh, really?
| COMPILING the kernel:
| 
|  - Make sure you have gcc-2.91.66 (egcs-1.1.2) available.  gcc 2.95.2 may
|    also work but is not as safe, and *gcc 2.7.2.3 is no longer supported*.
|    Also remember to upgrade your binutils package (for as/ld/nm and company)
|    if necessary. For more information, refer to ./Documentation/Changes.
(2.4.18 linux/README)
linux/Documentation/Changes is more helpful, though.
