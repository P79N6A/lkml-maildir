Hi Andrew,
With the "redefine register_hotcpu_notifier() stub as static inline
function" patch gone, I can no longer reproduce the section mismatches
mentioned in: x86_64-mce_amd-fix-section-mismatch-warnings.patch
[ The section annotations of that patch still stand, just the changelog
  is no longer completely accurate. ]
If we care enough about this, I'm resubmitting that patch with updated
patch name and changelog here -- the content is same.

[PATCH] x86_64 mce{_amd}: __cpuinit{data} section annotations
* mce.c:
CPU hotplug notifier callback function mce_cpu_callback() is not marked
__cpuinit and may thus go to the .text section unconditionally, but it
references mce_create_device() that is marked __cpuinit and may be
emitted into the .init.text section when HOTPLUG_CPU=n. This may cause
modpost to warn about this mismatch (in practice, though, the compiler
may elide the unreferenced callback function completely when
HOTPLUG_CPU=n therefore modpost may never warn).
Let us fix this by marking the callback as __cpuinit and corresponding
notifier_block as __cpuinitdata. Having done that, mce_remove_device()
is only ever called from __cpuinit marked functions so can be marked
__cpuinit itself.
* mce_amd.c:
Has an exactly similar issue as that discussed in previous case. Solve
it similarly by marking callback as __cpuinit and notifier_block as
__cpuinitdata. This causes a viral effect and allows us to mark a bunch
of other functions as __cpuinit also.
