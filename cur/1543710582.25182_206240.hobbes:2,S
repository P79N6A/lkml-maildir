find_vma() is often necessary to determine whether the page is mlock()'d.
In schemes where mm's that may not map the page appear in searches, it
may also be necessary to determine if there's even a vma covering the
area at all or otherwise a normal vma, since pagetables outside normal
vmas may very well not be understood by the core (e.g. hugetlb).
