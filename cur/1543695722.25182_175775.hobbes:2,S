Hi folks,
I got very strange problem with kernel 2.6.0-test8/9.
I have compiled the kernel with CPU 486/586 support and etc.
It works fine with P4, 486, AMD x586 CPUs but if I try to use on my
Compaq PIII 500Mhz PCs it hangs on after decompresing kernel.
Screen becames black and nothing hapens anymore.
These PCs works fine with kernel 2.4.xx kernels with very simmilar
configuration.
Any ideas?
Remus
