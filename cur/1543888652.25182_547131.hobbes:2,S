I was traveling abroad last week, without access to my devel
environment. Hans is currently working on a definitive fix for the
issue. His schedule is to have a proper solution until next week.
For now, it is better just to revert the bad changes. I've committed a
patch on my tree for that:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/mchehab/v4l-dvb.git;a=commitdiff;h=15ac2d293b08b6975c6ca1a80eb839d4cb0dddbf
I'm currently running some tests on my environment with the fix patches
I currently have. I should send a pull request to Linus later today.
