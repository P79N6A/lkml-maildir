Sorry, 2.0.36 was better. When I switch desktops in X, I get horrid
paging (in or out, I can't tell) that leaves windows undrawn and
the mouse cursor stuck in one spot. Recovery takes a second or two.
People with a 386 might be happy, but "a second or two" is quite
noticeable to my rather human brain. Linux 2.0.36 was a bit sluggish
at times, but never had such trouble changing desktops.
This machine is:
64 MB RAM
200 MHz Pentium MMX with 512 kB cache
32-bit 1024x960 Mach64 PCI video with 8 desktops
Two somewhat modern IDE disks (but no DMA for either kernel)
   hda: 42 MB swap and the OS
   hdc: 80 MB swap and my home directories
Both Netscape 3 and 4 are running, with both libc 5 and 6.
Netscape 4 has 77 lines in /proc/2298/maps.
Both nxterm and and the latest xterm are running. (13 total)
There are no interesting servers, not even inetd or the RPC portmapper.
No GNOME, no KDE, solid color background, plain FVWM.
