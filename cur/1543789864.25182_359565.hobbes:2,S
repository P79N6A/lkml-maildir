Could you describe this case a little more?  I wasn't aware
of this hotplug requirement, until I saw you comment just now.
The three reasons I knew of for wanting to move memory pages were:
 - offload some physical ram or node (avoid or unplug bad hardware)
 - task migration to another cpuset or moving an existing cpuset
 - various testing and performance motivations to optimize page location
