This means non GPL modules will disturb your timers again. probably not
a good strategy.

Consider a dual core Yonah/Merom: it has shared caches and the two cores
can only go to sleep together. With this the wakeups will be always
twice. Not good. I guess you need to add some topology awareness here
and e.g. only spread it for sockets.
BTW we normally put spaces around operators inside expressions.
