Sorry if I do not read kevent code correctly, but in kevent_user_wait() 
there is a:
    while (num < max_nr && ((k = kevent_dequeue_ready(u)) != NULL)) {
        ...
    }
loop, that make it O(ready_num). From a mathematical standpoint, they're 
both O(ready_num), but epoll is doing three passes over the ready set.
I always though that if the number of ready events is so big that the more 
passes over the ready set becomes relevant, probably the "work" done by 
userspace for each fetched event would make the extra cost irrelevant.
But that can be fixed by a patch that will follow on lkml ...
