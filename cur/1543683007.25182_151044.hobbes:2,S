On some platforms a global register current was a win, I can't speak for
m68k - current is used a lot.

A lot of platforms went this way because "current" is hard to do right
on an SMP box. Its effectively per CPU dependant, and that means you
either set up the MMU to do per CPU pages (via segments or tables) which
is a pita, or you do the stack trick. For uniprocessor a global still
works perfectly well.

Code size for critical paths is getting more and more performance critical
on x86 as well as on the embedded CPU systems. 3Ghz superscalar processors
lose a lot of clocks to a memory stall.
