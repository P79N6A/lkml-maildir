There are plenty of drivers in there using subsys_initcall, arch_initcall,
postcore_initcall, core_initcall and even one pure_initcall.
Heaven knows why.  They're drivers :(

A heck of a lot of things can trigger an /sbin/hotplug run.  It could well
be that Andrew's driver didn't want to run hotplug at all, but the kernel
did it anwyay.  But as soon as the script appeared at /sbin/hotplug, and it
happened to use foo|bar: boom.
