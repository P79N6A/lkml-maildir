To help anybody else wondering about these issues, I've cc'd my reply
to the Linux-Kernel mailing list for comments. However, please note
that the comments herein are expressions of my own opinions, and may
not reflect those of other developers.
Additional comments from other developers should be cc'd to Tony as I
don't think he's on this list. However, I am on the list, so there is
no need to CC to me...

Well, I'm not even sure what you mean by "kernel governance" but the
way to get your code into the kernel is well documented. Here's a
basic summary of the procedure:
 1. Subscribe to the Linux-Kernel mailing list. This is where
    ALL issues relating to the ENTIRE Linux kernel are thrown
    open for discussion.
    I will warn you in advance that this is a VERY active list
    and it is not unusual to get 300+ emails a day in that one
    list. My personal record from the Linux-Kernel list alone
    is 793 emails in one day. Make sure you can handle emails
    in that sort of volume first.
 2. Monitor the list for AT LEAST 15 DAYS to see what issues
    are being discussed at the moment. In particular, watch out
    for ANY emails from "Linus Torvalds" or "Alan Cox" which
    mention such things as "Feature Freeze".
 3. When you are satisfied with your understanding of the
    dynamics of the Linux-Kernel mailing list, post an email
    (sent using "Plain Text" mode - HTML emails are IGNORED by
    MANY of the kernel developers simply because of the volume
    of mail on the list.
    This email should contain a description of the purpose of
    your code, and should have attached to it (in MIME format)
    a PATCH against the relevant CURRENT kernel source tree
    that is in UNIFIED DIFF FORMAT. This format is generated
    by applying the -u4 parameter to the diff command.
    Note that the patch should NOT be embedded in the text of
    the email as doing so will almost certainly make the patch
    useless - it will either get munged by your email sending
    software or by the recipients mail reading software.
    Either the subject line or the descriptive text MUST state
    which kernel the patch file was generated against, and the
    email MUST have a subject line, preferably with the word
    PATCH in upper case together with a short (less than 40
    character) description of what issue the patch deals with.
    Note that the current kernels can normally be determined
    by pointing your web browser to 
http://www.kernel.org
 and
    scrolling down to the bottom of the page.
 4. Watch out for comments on your patch, and DEAL WITH THEM.
    Some people just ignore any comments, apparently on the
    assumption that they know what the kernel needs better
    than those who have been working on it far longer than
    they have, and after a while, the developers just stop
    reading their emails.
    You will also receive comments from people who have either
    just plain misunderstood your post, or who operate on the
    basis that their code is sacrosanct and your patch against
    it isn't worth considering as a result. Again, you will
    have to find a way of dealing with them.
    One basic rule here though: NEVER FLAME ANYBODY - NOT EVEN
    IN RESPONSE TO A FLAME. You'll only get yourself a bad
    name and reputation by doing so.
The following are common reasons for patches posted to the Linux
Kernel Developers mailing list being rejected:
 a. The patch is too complex.
    A patch that deals with too many issues will be rejected
    simply because of its size, as those who are responsible
    for the relevant part(s) of the kernel just don't have
    time to go through them.
    If you have dealt with several issues and the patches for
    each issue do not overlap, send the relevant patch for
    each issue in a separate email dealing just with that issue.
    If you have dealt with several issues and the patches
    overlap, you basically have two choices:
     1. If the patch dealing just with the issues that overlap
	is not too large (say less than 50 lines in length),
	send a combined patch dealing just with the issues that
	overlap, and enumerate precicely which issues are dealt
	with, emphasising that they overlap.
     2. If the patch is too large, decide which of the issues
	is "most important" and send a patch dealing just with
	that issue. Wait to see what happens to that patch,
	then send a patch against the result dealing with the
	next most important issue.
	Note that in this context, where there are three or more
	patches overlapping, the "most important" patch is often
	the one that has the result of de-overlapping most of the
	other patches.
    Note that "patches overlap" in the above means that lines
    relating to two different issues appear in the same patch
    hunk.
 b. The patch treats the symptoms, not the bug
    A patch that just treats the symptoms of a bug without fixing
    the bug itself will most often be rejected without comment.
 c. The patch is not SMP safe.
    Watch out for this one - the Linux kernel source tree needs to
    compile successfully for both UP (UniProcessor) and SMP
    (Synchronous MultiProcessor) environments, with the same code
    working in both.
    However, if this is the reason for rejection, you will normally
    be told precicely why your patch is not SMP safe.
 d. An equivalent patch from somebody else has already been applied.
    It happens {Shrug}.
 e. The patch doesn't apply cleanly against the stated kernel, or
    against the current kernel if that is different from the one you
    generated it against.
    If the current kernel changed around the time you generated the
    patch (which happens) and there were major changes to the file
    you patched (which also happens), you will need to generate a
    new patch taking account of the changes and resubmit it.
There are of course other reasons for rejection, but those occur so
often as to deserve quoting in advance.
Best wishes from Riley.
