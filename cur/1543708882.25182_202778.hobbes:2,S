Remember, that is only if all of:
1. glibc improperly uses raw kernel headers
2. usage is in such a way that warnings happen
3. you rebuild glibc with these kernel headers
If this is really the case, the warnings may be
eliminated by running a 1-line sed script over
the headers as they are imported into glibc.
It's something like this:  s/__u64/u_int64_t/
In return, you can have type-safety w/o warnings
during the kernel build.
In my example, suppose that foo is a pointer
to u64. You'd like to print the u64. If by
mistake you use the pointer itself, you won't
be getting a warning. The cast hides it.
