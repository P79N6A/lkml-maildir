Hello,
I want to set my development machine so I have multiple
kernels that I can boot. I don't need different versions
of kernel, but only 2.2.14 compiled with different 
options (e.g. with/without kdb).
So I have two kernel images, default and debug. I also
compiled modules for both of these kernels and configured
lilo like this:
image = /boot/vmlinuz-pc97-2.2.14-modular
        label  = linux
        root   = /dev/hda1
        vga    = 274
        read-only
        append = "debug=2 noapic nosmp"
image = /boot/bzImage-debug
        label  = debug
        root   = /dev/hda1
        read-only
        append = "MODPATH=/lib/modules/2.2.14-debug/"
If I boot to debug kernel, 'cat /proc/cmdline' shows this:
BOOT_IMAGE=debug ro root=301 MODPATH=/lib/modules/2.2.14-debug/
but modules are not loaded. Also, I have this in my /etc/modules.conf:
path[usb]=/lib/modules/`uname -r`/`uname -v`
path[usb]=/lib/modules/`uname -r`
path[usb]=/lib/modules/
path[usb]=/lib/modules/default        
but this should affect only USB modules, which I don't use.
What am I missing here?
Thanks,
Damir
