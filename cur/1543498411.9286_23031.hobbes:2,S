To save on bandwidth, here is the non-graphical version.. ;-)
...
per-CPU timeslice cutoff: 100.00 usecs
CPU0: Intel Pentium II (Deschutes) stepping 02
SMP motherboard not detected. Using dummy APIC emulation.
PCI: PCI BIOS revision 2.10 entry at 0xfb1c0
PCI: Using configuration type 1
PCI: Probing PCI hardware Linux
...
PIIX4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xf000-0xf007, BIOS settings: hda:pio, ...
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xf008-0xf00f, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, ...
.. and that's where it ends.
The next thing that _I_ get at this stage is "hda: ST3660A, ATA DISK
drive".

Tim.
