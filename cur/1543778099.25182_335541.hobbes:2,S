Another vote in favor of relayfs here ...
I am reminded by my good colleagues at SGI that relayfs is a key
to the Linux Trace Toolkit (LTT), which is in turn an important
technology for some product(s) on which SGI is working.
It is uses such as this which speak to the value of including
relayfs in the kernel.
