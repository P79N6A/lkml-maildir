Subject: [PATCH 02/17] Unionfs: ensure consistent lower inodes types
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/16/315

When looking up a lower object in multiple branches, especially for
directories, ignore any existing entries whose type is different than the
type of the first found object (otherwise we'll be trying to, say, call
readdir on a non-dir inode).
