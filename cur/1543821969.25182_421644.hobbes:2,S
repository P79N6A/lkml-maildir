Disregard my earlier theories about this problem, they where completely wrong.
Turns out it wasnt a Linux, skge or kernel version related problem at
all. After rebooting about 10 times and swapping network cards in my
computer a couple of times today, I tracked it down to the new
router/adsl-modem my ISP has supplied me with. It turns off its
ethernet port when nothing is connected to it for some reason. Doesnt
turn it on again until I reboot it with some network device connected
and powered on. This made me draw the wrong conclusions about versions
etc earlier, sorry about that.
