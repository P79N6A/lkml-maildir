I'd trigger it at the start of each cluster: much simpler, conceptually,
and it maximises the time you've got to do the IO in before the
application needs it.

Yes.

Use a separate context: mmap() activity should not have any affect on
the file stream that was mmaped.

The do_generic_file_readahead code has to deal with threads: you can
still have two processes owning a struct file *.  So yes, be correct
when you have threads, but don't worry enormously about being fast.
Readahead is almost by definition only meaningful when there is only on
accessor at a time.

Use the device max_readahead[] table --- that's what it is there for.
The readahead table will automatically get set up with meaningful values
if you are running a striped raid device.
