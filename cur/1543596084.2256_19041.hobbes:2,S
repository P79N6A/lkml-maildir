s/usually/sometimes/
Most of the time, it's only parsed by humans, with the possible exception  
of awk.
But feel free to look for other common Unix programs that behave  
differently. df, du, ps, ls, bash ... there *are* programs that announce  
the copyright at the start, but there are damned few of them. It's not in  
the culture.

OTOH, kernel output typically *always* goes into another program (dmesg,  
klog, syslog) ... though admittedly parsing it is not common. Well, except  
for the oops part (klogd, ksymoops).
