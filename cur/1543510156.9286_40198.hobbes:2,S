    Ha, you're right, the kernel doesn't see the HP as removable, only the
    sony is detected as a removable. (/var/log/dmesg)
Good. This explains why no check_media_change() was done.

    Yes.

    This is somewhat Alan suggested to me. So I inserted the
    ioctl(fd,BLKFLSBUF) directly into the eject code from Jeff Tranter.
    This works so far.
Yes. I mentioned BLKRRPART and not BLKFLSBUF because the latter does
invalidate_buffers() but not invalidate_inodes(), and you want to do both,
I think.
