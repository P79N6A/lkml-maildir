You can add the hwmon testing tree (from MAINTAINERS): 
> git lm-sensors.org:/kernel/mhoffman/hwmon-2.6.git testing
This tree gets rebased pretty much whenever Linus adds a new tag.  As a
rule of thumb, you should merge from Jean Delvare's i2c tree first.  The
hwmon/testing tree does not usually depend on anything else.
Thanks & regards,
