AIUI, the raid stuff wasn't in 2.2.11, so adding it can't break anything. If
you've been smoking strange patches, then you have to pay attention when
switching to or from the vanilla branch. If your vendor added something to
the kernel which you rely on, you should probably wait for an update from
your vendor if you're not prepared to keep an eye out for problems.
