All drivers under drivers/video/console. That would be:
vgacon
dummycon
fbcon
newport_con
sticon
promcon
mdacon
There are perhaps a few more drivers outside this directory, such as
sisusbcon or something.

That's right. But setting the blink attribute is done with an XOR (^).
So 'setterm -blink' on will unset the blink attribute (0x80 ^ 0x80).

Yes, but if the tty driver type is a virtual console, then vt.c is still
affected. 
Well the blink attribute is ignored by most drivers, if I'm not
mistaken. So you generally won't see the effect :-). But with fbcon, the
blink attribute is interpreted as "change background color from black to
light gray".
