I just got bit by the 'journal aborted' problem under -rc1-mm5, so it
looks like that particular bug wasn't at fault here (also, I started seeing
the problem under -mm2, so that's another point against that theory...)
Sep 16 01:29:05 turing-police kernel: journal_bmap: journal block not found at offset 5132 on dm-8
Sep 16 01:29:05 turing-police kernel: Aborting journal on device dm-8.
Sep 16 01:29:05 turing-police kernel: ext3_abort called.
This happened about 4 minutes into a 'tar cf - | (cd && tar xf -)' pipeline
to clone a work copy of the -rc1-mm5 source tree (it got about 408M through the
543M before it blew up)....
