That would be a bug. Although I suspect it's also a case of "don't do that
then" - you _really_ shouldn't indiscriminately touch files in /proc,
since they often have magical properties.

The latter is not a bug, it's just an example of the magical properties of
/proc. Some files may _look_ like regular files, but you shouldn't depend
on it.
