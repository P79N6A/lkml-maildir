OK, the problem is that drm_device.tq is a tq_struct, which we just got
done redoing. tq->next was removed in favor of the new tq.list.
so drm_device.tq needs to be rewritten to use the new task queue, and the
problem will be solved.
ill dig through the archives and see if i can figure out the new queue (is
there something in /Documentation?) and get a patch out ... i wonder how
many other drivers need to be patched to handle the new task queue?
