Correct me if I am wrong, but a IRDA and Bluetooth device will still have
userspace representation with a standard userspace tool right.
And with such a tool it would be normal to have a on/off switch for the radio
I would expect (and would find strange if such a switch is not there)
I have never used bluetooth or IRDA device so I can't talk from
experience here.

Ok, that would make sense. I'll try to add the sysfs attributes you recommended.
I'll also have to add bluetooth/irda/bluetooth message seperation, since
at the moment pressing the wifi button for example would also
disable bluetooth devices and that is likely not desired by the users, (I already have
received objections about it, with requests to change that behaviour)
