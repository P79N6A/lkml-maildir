Nothing at all, now that you've explained it. If all you want to do is
present the code I write in a form that's more convenient for others
to read, I think that's great.
I thought it might be the "hostile takeover" that you mentioned last
week, along with putting up a CVS tree. If that's not your intention,
that's fine. That's why I asked "is this the hostile takeover you've
mentioned", because I wasn't sure.
In fact, given the other code in the tree that doesn't conform to
CodingStyle, it makes sense run lindent on the whole tree and make
that available. As long as people understand that they should generate
patches against the real tree, and not the lindented one.
