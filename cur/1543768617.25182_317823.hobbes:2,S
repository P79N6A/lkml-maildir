Guess what?  It's already there.  Look in ptrace_attach() in
kernel/ptrace.c
You could argue about the usefulness of ptrace.  The point is, that
suid/sgid programs _can_ be discerned, and ptrace _needs_ to discern
them.
And for the same reason, user controlled filesystems also need to do
this check.  See Documentation/filesystems/fuse.txt in -mm and later
discussion in this thread for more information.
The strange thing is that people argue so vehemently about this on
theoretical grounds.  But practice shows, that there's in fact no
problem with it whatsoever.  This check (or something similar), has
been in FUSE for more than 3 years, used by thousands of people, and
it didn't cause _any_ problems, except various sub-mount related
things, which we are trying to solve properly, by making mount
unprivileged.
