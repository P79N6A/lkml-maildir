They're defacto standards that have been in use for well over a decade.  
If the same could be said about GiB, maybe I could agree with you.

Hmmm, all of the advertising, computer media and electrical engineering 
related material I've read recently seems to be using GB.  In fact, there 
was one very article about the whole issue that found the computer 
industry to be remarkably consistent in using terms like "10GB" with no 
space between the number and the measuring unit.  Oh wait, sorry, that's 
not formally approved by any standards bodies.

Many standards bodies are examples of confusopolies.  Take a look at the 
POSIX threading standards.  Do they make people's lives easier under 
Linux?  Should we accept every standard at face value and follow it 
obediently wherever it takes us?

Can you send me replacements for all the documentation I've got that 
mentions GB or KB then?  I wouldn't want to be non-compliant.
