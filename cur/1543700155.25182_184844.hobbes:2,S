It didn't get logged, so I don't have the full trace, but I remember
that it indicated a program we run called raidm, which checks the
status of our RAIDs periodically.  We'd forgotten to gun the instance
which was watching the RAID we disconnected.
Running raidm on a connected RAID, I can see that it opens the device
and sends some ioctls:
...
stat64("/dev/sda1", {st_mode=S_IFBLK|0660, st_rdev=makedev(8, 1), ...}) = 0
open("/dev/sda1", O_RDONLY)             = 3
ioctl(3, FIBMAP, 0xbfff4840)            = 0
ioctl(3, FIBMAP, 0xbfff4840)            = 0
ioctl(3, FIBMAP, 0xbfff4910)            = 134217730
ioctl(3, FIBMAP, 0xbfff4910)            = 134217730
ioctl(3, FIBMAP, 0xbfff4910)            = 134217730
ioctl(3, FIBMAP, 0xbfff4910)            = 134217730
ioctl(3, FIBMAP, 0xbfff4910)            = 134217730
ioctl(3, FIBMAP, 0xbfff4910)            = 134217730
time(NULL)                              = 1071757056
open("/var/log/raidm.log", O_WRONLY|O_APPEND|O_CREAT, 0666) = 4
fstat64(4, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=5049303, ...}) = 0
...
I can't afford to kill the machine again, otherwise I'd trigger the
oops again.  Shouldn't scsi or aic7xxx not let me open(2) the device
if nothing's attached?
