  Well my aicxxx problems continue:
  I did it again and indeed verified similar error messages as I had
  under stock 2.4.3 and 2.4.3+aic 6.1.8. This time it died during boot itself
  starting with complaints from ssh/xinet et al - then I started seeing the
  scsi errors.  (I believe I had also tried ac26 with similar problems hwhich IIRC 
  is  6.1.5).
  Anyway, it goes around in a loop with stuff like:
  SCB 1 ...
  scsi ... 
  scsi   ... recovery complete ..
  scsi   ... code aweke ..
  scsi   ... aic7xxx_abort returns 8194
  or somwething similar. The aic7xxx_abort returns 8194 i remember exactly the others 
  I'm a bit shaky on. Anyway it seems to loop with the recovery/abort thing.
  What can I do to help track down the problem? 
  Regards,
  Gene/

I enclose output of ver_linux - I note that it incorrectly reports util-linux
becuase it uses mount --version. On my redhat system mount is 2.10r while util-linux
is 2.10s-11.
