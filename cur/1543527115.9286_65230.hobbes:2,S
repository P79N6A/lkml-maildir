Most of them would be just one or two lines, and probably harder to
understand than the original code. Also, they all share a few common
variables (e.g. dma_wr, size), so you'd end up with a comparably fat
interface and/or you'd give gcc's ability to merge common expressions
in inlined functions a pretty good test.
