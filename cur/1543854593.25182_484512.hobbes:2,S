Subject: [PATCH][0/2] NFS: Calculate 'w' a bit later in *_encode_getaclres()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here are two patches that implement a tiny performance improvement for NFS.
The change made is to calculate the value of the 'w' variable a little 
later than is currently done. This way we don't waste time calculating 'w' 
in the cases where we return from the function before using the calculated 
value.  It also saves a few bytes of .text, which is always nice.
The last time around these got merged in -mm and subsequently dropped - 
according to akpm, they got dropped due to maintainer NACK, but my 
impression was that this change was OK.  So, this time around It would be 
great with an explicit ACK or NACK so akpm can add the patches or ignore 
them.
The two patches are send with the following subjects to the same recipients
as this mail:
  [PATCH][1/2] NFS2: Calculate 'w' a bit later in nfsaclsvc_encode_getaclres()
  [PATCH][2/2] NFS3: Calculate 'w' a bit later in nfs3svc_encode_getaclres()
Kind regards,
