Of course I mean SCHED_OTHER tasks at the same nice level. Otherwise
I would be arguing to make nice basically a noop.

Being fair doesn't prevent that. Implicit unfairness is wrong though,
because it will bite people.
What's wrong with allowing X to get more than it's fair share of CPU
time by "fiddling with nice levels"? That's what they're there for.

Been a while since I really looked at the mainline scheduler, but I
don't think it can permanently starve something, so I don't know what
your bounded unfairness would help with.
