Dave,
It's a disclaimer that I don't have a choice in having attached to my
email.  If you actually read it, it only says that if you don't think it's
intended for you then contact the sender and delete the message.  The PC
police at the institution I work for don't want to have a law suit because
of someones mistake (lawyers).
Regards,
James Bourne
