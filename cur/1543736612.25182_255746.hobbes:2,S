 Hi Greg,
 I did some trivial cleanup in usb-serial subsystem code
(drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c).
 The main change is the first patch, which moves the search
in device list out of usb_serial_probe(). It is the first
of some patches to make usb_serial_probe() more simple (today
it is an very big function).
 I'm sending only one patch for usb_serial_probe() organization
because I'm not certain if is the better/right thing to do, so,
comments and flames are welcome. :)
 Well, hope some of the patches to be applyed.
 Summary:
[PATCH 1/5]: usb-serial: Moves the search in device list out of usb_serial_probe().
[PATCH 2/5]: usb-serial: create_serial() return value trivial fix.
[PATCH 3/5]: usb-serial: return_serial() trivial cleanup.
[PATCH 4/5]: usb-serial: usb_serial_register() cleanup.
[PATCH 5/5]: usb-serial: Add module version information.
OBS: The patches are against 2.6.9-rc2-mm4, because your last
USB tree is there.
 Thanks,
-
