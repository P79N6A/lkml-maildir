All patches are appreciated, but not all are applied ;)
Sure, go for it - let's see what the patches end up looking like.  We might
find real bugs in there - I found a bunch of howlers back in 2.3.late. 
That was with `gcc -W' which turns on more than -Wsigned-compare.
Maybe you could prepare a quick overall summary first, see if you can work
out the overall scope of the problem and then we can take a look at that,
decide what bits to attack?
