Noticed that. Well, which device to use is a decision of the user and
the kernel should be able to handle his needs, independently from
being the most secure or not.

At least they have something in common: all of them deliver an image
as output. Maybe that could be centralized somehow... for example, a
single structure that we use to ask for the capabilities of a fp
reader and the driver fills it telling the maximum resolution of
image, if it supports encryption or not (or if the datastream that
comes from the driver is encrypted or not), etc. What the userspace
does with the image is irrelevant. Let's imagine that: I have a daemon
in userspace that is responsible for reading fingerprints from
/dev/fingerprint[012], and it is supposed to be device-independent. So
this device asks the device for information about its capabilities,
and the device returns the information as a structure (for example
telling the dimension of the image returned, the image format, etc).
How does encryption-based readers works ? I suppose that a software
driver or library in userspace should be responsible for decrypting
the image and processing it, right ? So, in this case, the decryption
could be done at kernel level (to fit the model above, where just
images are returned), or giving the option for the userspace to
receive the raw encrypted stuff.

At some point, the encrypted image needs to be decrypted for
processing, so it can be stolen anyways, right ?
