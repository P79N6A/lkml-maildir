this argument is analogue to the adaptec SAS driver one about the scsi
host structure. ieee80211 should be a LIBRARY of functions that can do
things, the driver should be able to use the library or not at its own
choice. forcibly making the ieee80211 layer deal with the WE's is the
wrong way for this kind of thing, especially since several layers of the
stack will be optional, so it has to be possible for drivers to go
"until this layer I use the ieee80211 library functions, below that my
own".
