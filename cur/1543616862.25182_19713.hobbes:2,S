The system is *heavily* swapping. Plain 2.4.18-pre3 can not even finish
the jobs because it runs out of memory. That's why I used j75 or j100
initially. Otherwise there was not even a difference between the 2.4.10+
vm and the 2.4.9-ac+ vm. All I want to test with this "benchmark" is how
well the system reacts when I throw *lots* of compilation jobs at it ...

Using just -j1 or -j2 will probably be no difference (I will test it anyway
and post the results).

But what *I* like most about the preemptive results are that the results
for all runs do not vary that much. Looking at plain 2.4.18-pre3 there
is a huge difference in runtime between the fastest and the longest run.
