I agree.  Thanks to David Woodhouse for feeding it and DaveM for
creating it.
I'd like to suggest that once Linus makes a release and all of the
changeset diffs are wiped out on kernel.org, that a message be sent to
bk-commits indicating that.  Nothing fancy, just an empty message with a
subject of "--MARK--" would be nice.  But either way, it's a great
list.
