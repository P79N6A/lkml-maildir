  Not so ``ancient'' in this regard.  That interface hasn't changed

  Right.  I will have a look as a part of my LFS(*) patches.
The kernel interface is in fact pread64()/pwrite64() even though not
*named* so, thus the difference in between user-space calls of  pread()
and pread64() is library issue.
Perhaps the  iBCS needs some carefull updating ?

  Well, marginally.
