Sorry, I don't understand what you're saying.  I would think that making
it _conditional_ would make things harder to read, because of all the
extra "#ifdef" and "#endif" lines plus the need to keep two different
versions of the code in mind.
Did you mean to say "conditional" instead of "unconditional"?
Incidentally, I do believe that for certain applications (embedded
devices, for instance) it makes sense to avoid including all this code.  
The cleanest way to do that would be to make both PTRACE and UTRACE
configurable.

I agree with Christoph.  Plenty of other interfaces in the kernel do the 
same thing.

I'll be happy to rename the structures and the files if Roland doesn't 
mind.
