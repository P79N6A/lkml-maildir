Hm. No. I mean there are no more testing-bk snapshots. For example. I can't 
find 2.6.12-rc1-bk2.bz2; I have downloaded it on Saturday, but I can't find 
testing bk snapshots anymore. Is this what you are referring as "scripts are 
confused"? Or am I obliged to use bitkeeper from now on?
Many thanks,
Norberto
