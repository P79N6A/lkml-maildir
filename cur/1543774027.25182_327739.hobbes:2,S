Hi!
I've got this one on brand new IBM 8840-21Y.
Both i386 and x86_64 kernels say:
ACPI: RSDP (v002 IBM                                   ) @ 0x00000000000fdfb0
  >>> ERROR: Invalid checksum
And go crazy (incorrect sibling count, [censored] cache, ...).
I've attached gzipped dmesg, acpidmp, dmidecode, lspci-vvv. A bit
gzipped, because they are too large...
