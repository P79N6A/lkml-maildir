I'm not convinced changing agpgart is worth the pain.
The only userspace app that actually grovels through the aperture
in this way is the agpgart test code, so this shouldn't be an issue.
I thought the DEBUG_PAGEALLOC stuff just unmapped pages that had been
kmalloc'd ?  The area of memory we're trying to read those mptables from
shouldn't be unmapped in the first place should they ? Confused.
