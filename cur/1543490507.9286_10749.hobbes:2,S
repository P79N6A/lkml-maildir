Oh? Then what would you do about
#!/bin/make -f
or
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
or
#!/bin/tail +2
All are standard, the last one in form of
#!/bin/tail +2

placed into /usr/local/sbin/FOAD, so that you could do
chsh -s /usr/local/sbin/FOAD lusername
when needed. And yes, it's a standard practice (modulo names).
If everything from '\0' to ' ' is whitespace you are going to have a fine
time with any langauge. And if CP/M bogosity with \r\n can be served by
stripping \r, what will you do with equally evil MacOS bogosity (\r)?
Hint: \r is *not* the same thing as \n - there are situations when two
newlines are different from a single newline (TeX, for one).
