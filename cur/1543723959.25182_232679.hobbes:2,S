Hi Greg, others,
Hope this is not a FAQ.
I want to export some read-only attributes (statistics) from cyclades.c char 
driver to userspace via sysfs. 
I can't figure out the right place to do it - I could create a class under
/sys/class/cyclades for example, but that doesnt sound right since this 
is not a "class" of device, but a device itself.
Hooking the statistics into /sys/class/tty/ttyC$/ sounds reasonable, but
its not possible it seems because "tty" is a class_simple class, which only implements 
the "dev" attribute.
What is the appropriate place for such driver-specific attributes?
TIA
