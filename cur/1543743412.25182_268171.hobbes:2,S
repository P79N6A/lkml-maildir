    You can't wait for other's children. OTOH, if we talk about your
children, you can do wait() or waitpid() (I assume that you referred
to waitpid(), since there isn't waitfor() AFAIK). The only difference
is that wait suspends the process until information from a child is
available.
    If you are talking about others' children, then your call to
waitpid() (or wait()) failed with ECHILD: not your child.
