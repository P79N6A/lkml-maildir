     Hello,
   I have recently upgraded a server, from 2.4.4 to 2.4.9, with a M54p-09N
motherboard (Dual Pentium 133) and I've got the same result, with two
differences, mine boots in SMP with "nomce", and I don't get any oops, the
server just hangs after all that MCE reports.
    Is there something that I could do to debug it?
    Regards.
    -Jorge
