Ok, I agree with your argument concerning read(). 
Concerning reading/writing from offsets, it's up to the drivers for them 
to either support it or not. In the files I've done so far, I return 0 if 
show() is called with an offset. Which will give different results if you 
read byte-by-byte or an entire chunk. 
It makes the callbacks simpler, but it is not technically correct. 
Something I did a while ago was implement default callbacks for basic 
types. So you would have something like:
default_show_u32(char * buf, size_t count, loff_t off, u32 * data)
{
	...
}
So the driver could do 
driver_show(struct device * dev, char * buf, size_t count, loff_t off)
{
	return default_show_u32(buf,count,off,&data);
}
And in the default_* handle the offset appropriately. 
If that seems reasonable, I'll dig it up and integrate it...
