Could you make this controlable with option -verbose, see below.

1) you uses include but asm/ - use final '/' for consistency.
2) Using asm/ you require the symlink to be present. Which obvious
it a most when  doing this check, so we better secure that.

I much rather have it be: include/headercheck
then people realise where eventual temporary files comes from.
So we need something like the following here: (untested)

With respect to passing on to Linus.
I would like to have a bunch of files converted first so we can see the
effect of requiring this check.
Also I am still a bit uncertain if this is the right approach,
but until now this is the only patch...
