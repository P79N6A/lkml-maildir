Be careful. *4 is not a simple <<2 substitution (by the compiler) if
the variable is signed. *4 translates to 3 instructions (on x86) if
it's an int.
My feeling is that it shouldn't matter if you use <<2 or *4 even if the
compiler optimises - one would hope that the compiler would optimise to
the fastest in both directions.
