Except that's different than current behavior presented to userspace.
IOW, we broke userspace for anyone using udev. Which is, y'know, a lot
of us.
We're at -rc2 right now. Given that, it looks like we have two
options. First is to revert all this for now and try again when the
patch has had more testing and agreement (as this isn't a major
feature we're talking about here; it's effectively just a cleanup that
happened to have unfortunate side-effects).
The second option is that we could have the loop device start with 8
nodes populated, which would match current behavior.
A third option of requiring new userspace for 2.6.22 is a non-starter.
