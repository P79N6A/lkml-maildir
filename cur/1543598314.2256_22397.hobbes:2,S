devfsd and the compatability links work correctly as of 2.4.8 with the
patch you provided.
This is quite possibly user error and not a kernel issue, but it seems
pppd 2.4.1 breaks once I've got the stallion card under devfsd with
compatability links.
mgetty runs on device lets say, /dev/ttyE2 (symlink to /dev/ttyE/2), and
passes off incoming connections to pppd. I'm expecting pppd is gonna want
to look at /etc/ppp/options.ttyE2, but its not.
If I change stallion.c at around line 145 from:
static char     *stl_serialname = "ttyE/%d";
To:
static char     *stl_serialname = "ttyE%d";
so that the real device becomes /dev/ttyE2 rather than a symlink to
/dev/ttyE/2 pppd starts looking at the correct options file.
pppd seems to be able to handle the compatability symlinks just fine on
/dev/ttyS* devices and find the proper ppp options file to look at. So I'm
guessing they've got a hack to handle devfsd standard serial ports, or I'm
doing something wrong somewhere.
