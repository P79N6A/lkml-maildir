Then don't use FAT on DVD-RAM :-). ide-cd will already appropriately
cache a single block and dish out 512b sectors from that as needed
for FAT etc when reading. Writing is a bit more difficult, as that
then turns out to generate a read before we can commit a dirty
block. IMO, this type of thing does not belong in the drivers --
we should _never_ receive request for < hard block size.
