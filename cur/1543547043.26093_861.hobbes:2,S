Yes and no. It depends on which system you had. If memory serves:
11/05 - no
11/10 - no
11/20 - optional (not usally provided)
11/30 - optional (depended on configuration)
11/35 - included (may have been optional)
11/40 - included (may have been optional)
11/45 - included (all versions higher than 45 included MM built in)
Then there are the LSI versions:
LSI 11 - no
LSI 11/34 and higher - yes (11/34M equivalent - the M was memory management)
In the PDP-11/45 (the first version to have MM) memory management was an
add-on capability and was available without.
Many of these systems were used in embeded configurations. The PDP-10 used
an 11/20 as an IO/communications controller, and had an optional mm unit
to be able to address the 18bit range of the PDP-10 (and DecSystem 10).
It was optional because the PDP-10 didn't always have the memory that would
demand it.
The 11/30 was used in some aircraft equipment.
The 11/40 was used where the embeded system needed floating point. I think
that was in custom autopilots (not seen often).
