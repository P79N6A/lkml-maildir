Ok, here is a patch.  See what you think.  This patch assumes that Lee's patch 
has been merged (although it eliminates all of it).

Source: MontaVista Software, Inc. George Anzinger george@mvista.com
Type:  Enhancement 
Disposition: pending
Description:
This patch changes the update of the cmos clock to be timer driven
rather than poll driven by the timer interrupt function.  If the clock
is not being synced to an outside source the timer is removed and thus
system overhead is nill in that case.  The update frequency is still ~11
minutes and missing the update window still causes a retry in 60
seconds.
