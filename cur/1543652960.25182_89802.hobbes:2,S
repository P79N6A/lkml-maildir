I think the problem with this scheme is that all of the components
in the -ac or -mm trees are slumped into a single component.
If we have to use a 2-level component list, then I'd prefer we
do the following:
Category = 2.5-linus, 2.5-ac, 2.5-mm, etc.
Component = something like
      MM-Page allocator
      MM-Slab allocator
      MM-NUMA
      MM-MTTR
      MM-Others
      FileSys-devfs
      FileSys-ext2
      FileSys-ext3
      and so on...
In other words, we just collapse the original category/component
list into a single level, and leave the top level to indicate which
trees.
Of course, only components belonging to a selected tree is displayed.
This would allow each tree to have its own set of components, which
can have different owners.
I have talked to Jon Tollefson and Jon agreed that this approach
is better.
We need to do it ASAP since the number of bugs (50+ currently) is
relatively small.  We do NOT want to wait until later to make
any structural changes to the component list because that would
be a nightmare to reclassify hundreds of bugs.
Another option would be to use the "group" concept in Bugzilla to
provide the 3-level component list structure that I described
previously, but this would require some coding changes.
The above approach does not require any coding changes in Bugzilla
and is therefore preferrable.
