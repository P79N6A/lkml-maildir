I assume you're using Francois' git tree, right?  What you need to do is:
  - Check out netdev-ipg branch:
    git checkout netdev-ipg
  - Create a new branch against netdev-ipg (this is where you'll do the
    work):
    git checkout -b ipg-mine
  - Commit patches in your ipg-mine branch.  Use git update-index and git
    commit for this.  Please commit each changeset separately.  You can 
    use my patchset as a starting point:
     
http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/penberg/linux/ip1000-jesse/
  - When you're done, you can generate diffs against the netdev-ipg 
    branch:
    git format-patch netdev-ipg ipg-mine
  - If you want, you can then delete your working branch:
    git checkout netdev-ipg ; git branch -D ipg-mine

The changelog isn't telling me much.  Why are you removing default phy 
params and the threshold config?
