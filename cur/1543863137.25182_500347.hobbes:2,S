Hi,
I have been testing my wireless zd1211rw driver with kismet, but have noticed my logs filling up
with these messages instead:
BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/mutex.c:86

According to the comment in linux/net/core/dev.c
 * 2) Since we run with the RTNL semaphore not held, we can sleep
 *    safely in order to wait for the netdev refcnt to drop to zero.
Well, apparently we can't sleep safely after all because IRQs have been disabled.
Cheers,
Chris
