I dont get you, sorry (I'm not a real expert on that piece of code, 
so...).
From what I understand the "if (old_mm && mm_users == 1)" if case is just 
an optimization to avoid the allocation of a new mm structure.
The functionality will be the same without that piece of code, it will 
just be slower.

Exactly.

Doing that locking inside exit_mmap() not feasible IMO... it might be too 
expensive.
