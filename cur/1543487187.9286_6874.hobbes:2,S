Morning all,
Got a problem with a twin PII (Klamath) it's been dying about once
every one to two days since being brought into service (mail relay/pop
server).  Finally got something intelligent out of it (screen blanking
is a complete arse at times).
--[ error ]--
wait_on_bh, CPU1
irq: 0 [0 0]
bh: 1 [1 0]
followed by a seemingly random set of numbers
... repeat many times...
--[ error ]--
The machine is running with ide and scsi controllers in SMP mode, with
an Intel Express Pro 10/100 network card.
Anyone got any ideas?  My next guess is to try either 2.2.2 or switch
off SMP or both.
	Mark
