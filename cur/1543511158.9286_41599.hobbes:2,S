Well it is supposedly the job of the driver to check that with the
hardware that data is actually available before taking it for
granted. This may for various reasons be problematic if the cheap
designers did stupid things etc.

Sure this is a good rule of thumb, however shared interrupts should
not cause any problems on PCI. If they are the first one to turn to is
really the device driver author ;-)

Well serial is a medium that is almost guaranteed to lose data once in
a while ;-)
