Subject: I2C regression in post 2.6.14 gits..

Specifically,  BTTV driver fails to control internal
I2C devices in Hauppauge WinTV card with Bt848 onboard.
Baseline 2.6.14 works fine,  but 2.6.14-git2 fails.
Comparing kernel messages in between respective running
kernel versions with respect to bttv driver messages
I don't see really obvious differences at all.
Nevertheless it fails to activate correct input.
There are apparently also some changes in video
input driver, but nothing that plainly shows to
be related with this particular issue. (bttv / bt84x)
Any ideas ?  Possible fixes ?
