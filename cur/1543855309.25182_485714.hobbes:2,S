btw, I have some code almost ready for sata_nv to add proper 
suspend/resume support. Unfortunately I have trouble testing it, since 
STR doesn't work on my machine since, guess what - the video doesn't 
come back! It doesn't even take the monitor out of standby mode. None of 
the acpi_sleep options seem to work, and vbetool appears to helpfully 
segfault on any operation so that's out. This is an NVIDIA SLI setup so 
that probably makes things a bit more complicated.
In any case, it should be better than what we have right now for 
suspend/resume support in sata_nv, namely the "do nothing, won't work 
(at least not for CK804 and later)" implementation..
