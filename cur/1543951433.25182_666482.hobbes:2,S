It's also common for devices to have multiple power inputs which can be
run separately if required but which are normally tied together unless
there is a special reason to do so.

This is pretty much the model that is currently implemented.  A given
power management IC can have several regulators (that is, things which
have regulator IDs registered and can supply power).  Each regulator can
have multiple clients bound to it (that is, things that have called
regulator_get() and can consume power).  It is also possible to tell the
core that one regulator supplies another - if this is done then the core
will take care of ensuring that parents are enabled when their children
need them.

While the leaf enable/disable operations do happen at the client level
the core reference counts the enabled clients to control enabling of the
actual supply.
