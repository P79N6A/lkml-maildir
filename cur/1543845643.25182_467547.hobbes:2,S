Hello,
How are you creating/generating patch files?  (git, quilt, by hand, ...)
[quilt can help a bit if your answer is "by hand" or by custom tools.]
Please see Documentation/SubmittingPatches, e.g.:
section 12) The canonical patch format
Consider including output of "diffstat -p1 -w70" after the
"---" marker so that patch readers can see what files are
changed and how much.
Please add diff option "-p" also.
(all mentioned in SubmittingPatches)
