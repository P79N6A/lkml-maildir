I've just checked it with an ext2 filesystem - exactly the same thing happens.
Now, what's more interesting is that if I try again with a bigger filesystem
(3MB instead of 750KB) the problem only appears every now and again.
So it's probably got nothing to do with cramfs in particular, but more with the
size of the filesystem.
