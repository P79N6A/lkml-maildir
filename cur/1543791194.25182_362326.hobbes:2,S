that would be comparing apples to oranges. There is a big difference 
between "VM failures under high load", and "failure of VM functionality 
for no user-visible reason". The fragmentation problem here has nothing 
to do with pathological workloads. It has to do with 'unlucky' 
allocation patterns that pin down RAM areas which thus become 
non-removable. The RAM module will be non-removable for no user-visible 
reason. Possible under zero load, and with lots of free RAM otherwise.
