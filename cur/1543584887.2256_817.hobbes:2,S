Well, I use an old SuperMicro ( 
http://www.supermicro.com
 ) P6DNH
board.  It has 8 PCI slots, 3 ISA slots, an I960 I2O processor (four of
the PCI slots are on a secondary bus), and supports dual Pentium Pro
CPUs and 1G RAM (EDO - it's 4 years old).
They have newer boards with 6 PCI (64 bit, 66 MHz) + 1 AGP slot.  Their
boards are very high quality - though you'll pay for the reliability in
$$$.
