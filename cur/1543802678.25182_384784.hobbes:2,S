That's right, this might be a different issue. Now that it was X and not
"kswap0d" and that Arjan has asked me, I've realized that I'm using the
binary nVidia driver. I had gotten pretty much the same issue with the
open driver, though. Still, since I changed kernels to 2.6.15, I'll try
again to catch the bad page state with the nv free driver.

BTW, what's the first 8 in flags:0x80010008? I can't find 1<<31 in
include/linux/page-flags.h
