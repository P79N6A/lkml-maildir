Absolutely not possible.  ;o)  Compiled with kgcc on Red Hat 7
(egcs 2.91.66).  I've been building kernels with egcs since Red
Hat 5.0 was released, no problems.
I've never used gcc 2.95.x at all, so I can't comment on it at
all..
It seems my hard disk may be failing...

Hmm.. must be a different problem than I'm having.  I've tracked
my problem down to disk accesses to hdb.  hda/hdc work fine, as
does the machine sitting idling doing its job.  If I do a copy
from hdb to hdc it explodes.  Very odd..  ;o(
