Etherboot is unlikely to support UNDI.
However there is already some code that was integrated that exports
the UDP/TFTP layers PXE clients use.  The code just needs some
cleanups so that it works, maybe weeks worth of work.  All of the
calls pxelinux use are already present.

I prefer an interface that does not need callbacks, things are just
plain simpler.  But when the callback is easy and there already is a
better mechanism I don't have a problem with it.
Of course it is worth noting that PXE runtime support on the itanium
does not even resemble PXE runtime support on x86.  Unlike unix it
does not have a stable API.
