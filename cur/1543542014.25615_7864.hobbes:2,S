Well, it depends on what you mean by 'the right thing'. I have an
in-kernel serial mouse driver, that easily handles all GPM-supported
serial mice (with a small daemon to do the autodetection / init /
userconfig / holding the devices open with an N_MOUSE ldisc), all in
about 290 lines of code. It uses the input interface, yes. It performs
better (updates/second) for some (all MSC, some Logitech) mice, though
not because of being in kernel.
I didn't submit it [yet], because the issue of whether serial mice
should be handled in the userland (GPM, and X, with sharing problems for
newer mice) or kernel was usually a cause of vast disagreement.

It's probably true, and it's also true X will very likely have all the
serial/ps2/busmouse/whatever mouse drivers always in it, if not for
Linux, then for other OSes, anyway.

Well, it still makes keyboard and joystick drivers much simpler.

Maybe. I personally never liked GGI much. In my opinion it was much too
complex for a simple (and impossible with the graphics part of it, too),
task. 
Well, even the X people seemed to like the input layer. I've discussed
it with Jim Gettys for example and found out this is very similar to how
he wanted the things to be when X was born.
And game developers like it too, for example Sam Lantinga of Loki said
something like (quotation far from exact) 'it's much easier to write
input-related stuff in Linux than in Windows, I really enjoyed it'.
And distribution makers like it. Once fully implemented, it could remove
most of the huge 'select your mouse type and model' menus in the
installers, a point where most users are perpetually making the wrong
choice. 
It's a level of abstraction that makes writing the low-level drivers
easier.  Makes the drivers shorter, too. Application writing easier. I
believe that's good.
