Subject: [PATCH] Add EEE Bluetooth ACPI details
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/3/411

Although rfkill support for the EEE bluetooth device has been added to
2.6.28-rc the appropriate ACPI accessor definitions were not added, so
the support was non functional. The patch below adds the get and set
accessors and has been verified to work on an EEE 901.
