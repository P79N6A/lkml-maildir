Indeed it would be interesting because assuming there are no bugs in my 
SCHED_ISO implementation (which is unlikely) it should perform the same.
There are a number of features that it would be nice to have addressed 
if we take this route.
Superusers are unable to set anything higher priority than unprivileged 
users. Any restrictions placed on SCHED_RR/FIFO for unprivileged users 
affect superuser tasks as well. The default setting breaks the 
definition of these policies, yet changing the setting to 100 gives 
everyone full rt access.
ie it would be nice for there to be discrepancy between the default cpu 
limits and priority levels available to unprivileged vs superusers, and 
superusers' default settings to remain the same as current SCHED_RR/FIFO 
behaviour.
