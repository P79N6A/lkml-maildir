Indeed how OSX does it is to pretend that it is paying any attention at 
all to the QoS requests that is given to it. In actual fact all it does 
is RR frequently enough and then everything tends to work anyway...
The reason I suggest not supporting priorities (at the moment) is for 
them to even work I would need to implement a complete Earliest Deadline 
First scheduler, ideally with more syscalls and transferring QoS 
requests to the scheduler. This is umm non-trivial to say the least... 
but possible on a landscape not living in a 2.6 forever development world.
