There is a ton of stuff pending for 2.5 IDE. Unfortunately 2.5 isn't in
a state I can do any usable testing so it will have to wait. The Marcelo
2.4 tree is current and I'm doing the work in 2.4 first now.
Rusty seems to have a lot of the module stuff in hand so hopefully I'll
get back onto 2.5 after LCA
