yeah. Subtypes start from 1, as 0 is the basic type.
Lock types are keyed via static kernel addresses. This means that we can 
use the lock address (for DEFINE_SPINLOCK) or the static key embedded in 
spin_lock_init() as a key in 99% of the cases. The key [struct 
lockdep_type_key, see include/linux/lockdep.h] occupies enough bytes (of 
kernel static virtual memory) so that the keys remain automatically 
unique. Right now MAX_LOKCDEP_SUBTYPES is 8, so the keys take at most 8 
bytes. (To save some memory there's another detail: for static locks 
(DEFINE_SPINLOCK ones) we use the lock address itself as the key.)
