Why? If memcpy can then be expanded in line, and the string is short, this
can be a *huge* win...

I think we MUST modify the RELOC macro. Currently the code has an undefined
meaning WRT th eC standard, so is allowed to do almost anything from working
as expected (quite bad in fact: it may suddenly fail when sth is modified
elsewhere), to triggering the 3rd World War :-)

That's a compiler dependant way to fix the problem that creates a constraint
on the compiler: it MUST then from now continue to have a given behaviour to
some undefined feature (that is in fact not even documented...) 
Note that the RELOC macro triggers an UNDEFINED behaviour, not an
IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED one, so the compiler writer is free of any constraint
and that would be a genuine extension the the C language to fix the
behaviour.
