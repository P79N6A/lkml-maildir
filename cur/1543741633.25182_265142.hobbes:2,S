how else the page allocator should work if not waiting all zones to hit
the low+reserve watermarks? the page allocator works the same in 2.4
and 2.6, so I don't understand your point.
what changes is kswapd stop algorithm and the fact the lru is per-zone,
but I think I described correctly what happens in 2.6 kswapd-stop.
