I'd hope they average a _lot_ less lately. I've been trying to be an 
absolute _bastard_ when it comes to patches. 
Yeah, I just looked. Lately they've been averaging about 3-4kB per day.
And the sick thing is, I'm still not satisfied. I want it to become an 
absolute _trickle_ of one-liners that fix real bugs.
So if you want incrementals and have a 1200 baud modem - be happy. The 
last week or so has been a pretty good week.
