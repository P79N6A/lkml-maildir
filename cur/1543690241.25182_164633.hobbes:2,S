agp_serverworks_probe() is marked __init.  Thus the static lookup 
called by the new_id code fails as this function is no longer in the 
kernel.  The fix is to remove __init from the probe routines.  I'm looking 
to see how often this occurs elsewhere.
sworks-agp.c also can't make effective use of the new_id code because it 
registers a single all-covering serverworks pci_device_id, then its probe 
routine checks for three specific device IDs and bails if it's not them.  
The new_id code can't help here.  The "right" way would be to register 
three separate entries in the pci_table and not test for them in the probe 
routine.
Thanks,
Matt
