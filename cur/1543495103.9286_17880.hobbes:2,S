You won't reduce the cost of goodness. You'll reduce the number of linear
search every sec from 40000 to 4000.
For the record 2.2.8-prex uses goodness in reschedule_idle(). The number
of the not needed schedule() invocation here is of the order of 2/3 every
sec or 10 under heavy load (never tried on 2.2.7 though, so I can't make
comparison).
2.2.8-prex has still some problem in reschedule_idle() (even if the whole
design is _far_ _far_ superior than the 2.2.7 one and I agree with it
_completly_), but at least it won't overschedule ;).
