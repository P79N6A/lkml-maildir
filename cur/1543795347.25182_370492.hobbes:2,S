Got it, building src tree now, config'd & building.
And, I unchecked everything but what I need to run this card (I think,
whatdoIknow) and got this at depmod time:

Maybe somebody can take the time to tell me what I do need to run a
pcHDTV-3000 in both ntsc and atsc modes using this newer code?
I was under the impression I needed the cx88 stuffs, ORV51132 (for
atsc) and nxt2002(for ntsc), but now we have lots of other dependencies
out the wazoo.  Please clarify.
