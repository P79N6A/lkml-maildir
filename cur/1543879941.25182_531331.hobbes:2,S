The refcounts we are talking about will not prevent modules from being 
unloaded.  That is, they won't cause rmmod to fail -- they will simply 
cause it to wait until the refcount drops to 0.  This should happen 
naturally as a result of the unregistration calls made by the module's 
exit routine.
(That was the intention, anyway.  I haven't yet seen all the parts of 
Cornelia's patch set, but that's how we discussed it.)

There are other ways for userspace to acquire references to kernel 
objects.  Think of procfs or debugfs, for example.  Or opening a device 
file.
Consider this example:  A user has a pcmcia card containing a USB host 
controller.  He plugs a USB flash drive into the card and mounts a 
filesystem stored on the flash drive.  The mount call increments the 
module refcount for usb-storage (the owner of the block device containing 
the filesystem), but it doesn't do anything to the module refcount for the 
pcmcia driver (I forget its name -- yenta or something like that).
So what happens if the pcmcia driver is unloaded while the filesystem is
mounted?  What happens when the filesystem is finally unmounted and a
release method belonging to the pcmcia driver is called?
The fundamental rule is that whenever you hand out a pointer to a routine
living in a module, the receiver has to increment the module's refcount.  
But the driver core violates this rule all over the place.  The most
pervasive offender is struct device -- it contains a release() method
pointer which often points into a module, but the driver core doesn't
do anything like try_module_get() in device_initialize() or module_put()
after calling dev->release().
