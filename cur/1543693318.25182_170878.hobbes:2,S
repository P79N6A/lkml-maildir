Rot.  First of all, *not* *all* *kobjects* *are* *in* *sysfs*.  And these
are pure loss in your case.
What's more important, for leaves of the sysfs tree your overhead is also
a loss - we don't need to pin dentry down for them even with current sysfs
design.   And that can be done with minimal code changes and no data changes
at all.  Your patch will have to be more attractive than that.  What's the
expected ratio of directories to non-directories in sysfs?
