There was a Usenix paper a couple of years ago:
    
http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/ana97/small.html
at which they did an evaluation of the normal splx() mechanism in NetBSD
with a simplified, Linux-like mechanism.  The simpler one won
hands-down.  They did note that spl made sense on older machines where
interrupt routines were, relatively, much longer due to the slower clock
speeds, but concluded that it didn't make sense on modern, fast CPUs.
Their proposal in the end is to protect kernel critical sections with
cli/sti, but to keep interrupts enabled during IRQs and rely on the PIC
to keep the interrupt line disabled during the ISR.  Odd, that looks
familiar, doesn't it?  :-)
