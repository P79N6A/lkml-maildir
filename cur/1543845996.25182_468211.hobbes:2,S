I see a very similar crash while running rcutorture on 2.6.18-mm1 and
my rcu patchset that has rcupreempt stuff rom -rt. I don't see this
while running on 2.6.18-rc3, but then rc3 had an older version
of rcutorture. I am working on narrowing it down.
The following script reproduces the problem quickly (within
a couple of minutes) in my 4-cpu x86_64 system -
#! /bin/sh
for ((i=0 ; i<200 ; i++))
do
        echo "Starting pass $i"
        modprobe rcutorture stat_interval=10 # test_no_idle_hz=1 shuffle_interval=5
        sleep 30
        rmmod rcutorture
        dmesg | sed -n -e '/^rcutorture: --- End of test:/p' | tail -1
done
exit 0
Thanks
