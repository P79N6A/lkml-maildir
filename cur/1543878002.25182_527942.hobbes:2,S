Does this actually solve the problem?  If the request queue is sufficiently
large (relative to the various dirty-memory thresholds) then I'd expect
that a heavy-writer will be able to very quickly take the total
dirty+writeback memory up to the dirty_ratio (should be renamed
throttle_threshold, but it's too late for that).
I suspect the reason why this patch was successful in your testing was
because dirty_start_writeback_ratio happens to exceed the size of the disk
request queues, so the heavy writer is getting stuck on disk request queue
exhaustion.
But that won't work if we have a lot of processes writing to a lot of
disks, and it won't work if the request queue size is large, or if the
dirty-memory thresholds are small (relative to the request queue size).
Do the patches still work after
`echo 10000 > /sys/block/sda/queue/nr_requests'?
