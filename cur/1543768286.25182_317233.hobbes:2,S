"dosfsck" did find a problem in the free-cluster value. And also said 
the backups FAT was different than the original FAT.
I didn't use "dosfsck" to fix the problems though (not that it couldn't, 
I just didn't try). As I had already copied everything to another disk, 
I just used "mkdosfs" to reformat the drive, and it works just fine now.
I still don't know what caused this, probably something related to some 
"kernel panics" I was seeing on shutdown (in a Fedora 3 installation, 
not Debian), after doing an umount+unplug.
I didn't though of using "dosfsck" because Windows' checkdisk was saying 
the filesystem was perfectly fine... It makes me feel really safe 
trusting MS tools... not.
