Subject: [PATCH] Bug in initrd-handling still there in 2.4.22-pre7
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/7/23/102

From original posting (2 weeks ago):
> At work we've encountered a problem when trying to netboot 2.4.21.
> After /linuxrc has been executed and the kernel tries to remount the
> root, it panics with the all too well known message "Unable to mount
> root fs on ...".
> 
> The kernel bugs out in mount_block_root in the file init/do_mounts.c,
> to be more precise in the for-loop. What happens is that it tries to
> mount the file system as type ext2 (which happens to be first in the
> list in our case), but instead of returning -EINVAL it returns -EBUSY,
> the loop exits instead of trying the next (correct) fs-type and the
> kernel panics.

It's been broken since 2.4.19, so I definitely think it's about time it
gets fixed. ;>
