Ok.

Fully agree. That's why I've sought to keep the copying in c - it makes it 
simpler to read and maintain (although at the expense of a little bit of 
ugliness with that if in the stack page allocation or (old way) working hard 
to make the C not use stack).

If you use the 'dynamically allocated pageflags' code (sure, pick a better 
name if you want), these changes will be pretty trivial - you can #define 
macros that could make the transition just a matter of switching PageNosave 
(eg) to PageSomethingElse. (Ditto for setting and clearing flags).

Sure. The bulk is in kernel/power/atomic_copy.c. Arch specific routines are 
include/asm-<arch>/suspend2.h.
