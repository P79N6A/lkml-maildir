can you give a try if you can deadlock 2.4.5aa1 just in case, and post a
SYSRQ+T + system.map if it still deadlocks?

The reserved pool for buffer heads is there since the first time I used
linux I think. I won't certainly object to convert  all reserved pool to
an unified interface, as I'd like if all hashtables would be also sized
with an unified interface, but that's just a stylistic issue, at least
for 2.4 that's a very secondary object compared to people who can get
dealdocks during production.
