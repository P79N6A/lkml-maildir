Subject: Ext3 Errors on Dell RAID

Problem:
I get massive ext3 errors once every few days. See "errors on console"
section below. Almost all commands return I/O error. I have to power
cycle the machine to get it running again. Upon reboot, there are
usually 3 orphan inodes deleted and everything is fine. See "messages
on reboot" below.
Configuration:
System: Dell PowerEdge 6300/500, 4 CPU SMP w/2GB memory
Discs: 3 SCSI discs in a controller-managed striped configuration
Controller: Dell PERC-2
kernel messages in "kernel boot messages" below
Other:
I had this problem before. I upgrade the card firmware to 2.8/build
6809, but still the same issue. I tried with the 2.4.29 kernel
(aacraid driver v 1.1-3) from the Slackware (10?) distribution and
then I upgraded to 2.4.31. It has the same driver version and same
problem. Running fsck always shows everything is fine (rc=0).
Does anybody have experience with this machine working well? If so,
what combination of kernel and firmware version?
Or does anybody know the root cause of the occasional massive ext3
errors or what I can do to test and/or fix it?
Please cc me jbalint-at-gmail as I am not on the list.
Thanks.
Jess
