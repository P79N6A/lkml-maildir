   SCSH_BH is gone in 2.5.23.  Matthew Wilcox has a patch to remove
   IMMEDIATE_BH.
   TIMER_BH is the only BH left as far as I know.
What about all of the serial driver BHs?  You keep avoiding this
issue.
Also, when people remove *_BH they should remove the define in
include/linux/interrupt.h Why people leave this there is beyond me, it
only causes confusion when people try to figure out what the current
state of affairs is.
