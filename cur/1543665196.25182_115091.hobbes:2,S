Really? So user has to know where ACPI tables are and specify less
than that on mem= command line? That seems very
counter-intuitive. [Ahha, its probaly okay because e820 saves you.]
What do you pass on 4GB machine as mem= parameter? AFAIK those beasts
have hole at 3.75G. [Hopefully bigmem machines have working e820
tables?]
