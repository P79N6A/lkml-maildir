Graham,
I am posting the private help in solving the IDE/SCSI CDRom for general

Obviously I didn't appreciate this information enough until I ripped the
machine apart and put the Toshiba over onto the secondary channel.  As one
would expect, I had tons of problems with 'Use DMA by default...' enabled.
And, after making the change you outlined above, it all works like a charm.
Got both the CD and the burner working, and UDMA support for the HD on the
primary channel.
Many thanks for bearing through my questions and for taking the time to work
through this with me Andre.  Happy holidays!!!

Please note that Graham reports that the new ALI UDMA updates.....

Can totally understand that.  I've found the ALI driver to give me a nice
boost in performance on this drive though; from 8.3MB/s up to about 12.5MB/s.
Talked to the manufacturer of the drive about something else and had mentioned
this when I spoke with them and they were quite impressed.  Response was
something like, "Wow!  That's great performance, you're not running Windows
are you?". :)

All of this error reporting is also observed under the 'W-word' OS if you
try to burn cd's with (U)DMA enable.  There is a buffer under run, due to
something not yet determined by me to date.  This statement is based on
imperical evidence and lots of skeet shooting of those little gold disk.
Also I don't believe that there is enough code support for (U)DMA xfers
run through the ide-scsi translator (this is what I call it).  Not that I
have not truly looked at the 'ide-scsi' stuff yet but should.........
