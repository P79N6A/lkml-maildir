Hi all,
I'm using a macbook pro 3,1 (mid-2007), and suspend worked ok with 
kernel 2.6.23.x, but with 2.6.25-rc{1,2,3,4} it just freezes during 
suspend. The console is still on, the disk is powered off, but no 
response or poweroff...
Did anyone else met the same thing? How could I help debug it?
What other info would you need?
Thanks,
