Thanks for the analysis. However I doubt the load_cr3 patch can fix
it. All it does is to stop the CPU from prefetching mappings (which
can cause different problem). But the Linux code who does bad pmd checks
never looks at CR3 anyways, it always uses the current->mm. If
bad pmd sees a bad page it must be still in the page tables of the MM,
not a stable TLB entry.
It must be something else. Somehow we get a freed page into
the page table hierarchy. After the initial 4level implementation
I did not do many changes there, my suspection would be rather
on the recent memory.c changes.
