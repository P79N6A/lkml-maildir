I'm sorry I don't have time at the moment to do digging of my own.
But I don't think you should have to define CONFIG_ISA.  I think
you hit the nail on the head in your last email -- PNP should be
reserving the resources of active devices.
The fact that PNP doesn't reserve them means PCMCIA is free to
claim them for itself.  So I think PNP is mostly at fault here.
(Of course, we'll still have to work around the Portege BIOS
issue as well.)

I suspect that things will mostly work if you load the drivers in
the (smsc-ircc2, wlags49_h1_cs) order.  Then smsc-ircc2 has a chance
to reserve the resources before yenta and wlags49 get involved.  But
of course, we can't rely on that workaround.
I think there's lots of work needed here -- make PNP reserve resources,
add smarter PNP quirk infrastructure so we can do things at _SRS-time,
add real Portege BIOS workaround, etc.  Way more than we can do for
2.6.22.
What do you think we need to get 2.6.22 out?  I was thinking of a
stop-gap patch like the one below.  I'm between trips and can't
really test it.  In my one quick boot, it did find the IR device,
but irdadump didn't seem to do anything.
[patch] smsc-ircc2: bypass PNP detection until we get the quirks worked out
Don't use PNP detection by default yet.  We have some PNP and BIOS issues
to work out first.
Sample problem on a Toshiba Portege 4000: the SMCf010 device is handed off
disabled.  We assign I/O ports originally assigned to the SMCf010 to a
PCMCIA device instead.  We enable the SMCf010, configuring it to use
disjoint ports, but _SRS doesn't work correctly, so the device doesn't
work.
