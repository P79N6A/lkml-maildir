It is a HUGE POS!
The obfustication (sp) level is so high you wonder why.
It may be GPL, but only goes to prove a few points that everyone lost on
me in the past.
OEM drivers in ATA suck!  Their CAM blows goat.
Look at the crap in the stack when Marcelo was suckered into taking a
"Promise Patch".
I have already cut all ties with Promise so here is the deal.
I no longer have to count the number of fingers on my hand between hand
shakes.  IE no extras and not shortages.
I wish you well in your adventures in pain.
