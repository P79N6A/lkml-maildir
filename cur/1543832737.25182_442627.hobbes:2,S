Hi,
A few months back, a fix was introduced for a mutex double unlock warning 
related to direct I/O in XFS. I believe that fix has a lock ordering 
problem that can cause a deadlock.
The problem was that __blockdev_direct_IO() would unlock the i_mutex in 
the READ and DIO_OWN_LOCKING case, and the mutex would be unlocked again 
in xfs_read() soon after returning from __generic_file_aio_read(). Because 
there are lots of execution paths down from __generic_file_aio_read() that 
do not consistently release the i_mutex, the safest fix was deemed to be 
to reacquire the i_mutex before returning from __blockdev_direct_IO(). At 
this point however, the reader is holding an xfs ilock, and AFAICT the 
i_mutex is usually taken BEFORE the xfs ilock.
We are seeing a deadlock between a process writing and another process 
reading the same file, when the reader is using direct I/O. (The writer 
must apparently be growing the file, using either direct or buffered 
I/O.) Something like this, on XFS:
(dd if=/dev/zero of=f bs=128K count=5000 & ) ; sleep 1 ; dd of=/dev/null 
if=f iflag=direct bs=128K count=5000
Seen on kernels 2.6.16 and 2.6.17.
The deadlock scenario appears to be this:
-The reader goes into xfs_read(), takes the i_mutex and then an xfs_ilock
XFS_IOLOCK_SHARED, then calls down to __generic_file_aio_read() which
eventually goes down to __blockdev_direct_IO(). In there it drops the 
i_mutex.
-The writer goes into xfs_write() and obtains the i_mutex. It then tries
to get an xfs_ilock XFS_ILOCK_EXCL and must wait on it since it's held by 
the reader.
-The reader, still in __blockdev_direct_IO(), executes directio_worker() 
and then tries to reacquire the i_mutex, and must wait on it because the 
writer has it.
And so we have a deadlock.
I leave it to the experts to figure out what the right fix for this might 
be. A workaround might be to not release the i_mutex during 
__blockdev_direct_IO().
Thanks
