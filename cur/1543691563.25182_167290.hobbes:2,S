2.6.0-test4 was pretty solid for me.  My main gripe was the weird key repeat 
problem I've mentioned before (where sometimes a key up event will get missed 
or delayed for no apparent reason, happens about twice an hour in normal 
laptop usage).
I upgraded to 2.6.0-test5, but USB didn't work (I bought a scanner), so I 
tried -mm2 and USB is back and happy.
But, twice in a row now I've made this happen:
 1391 pts/1    S      0:00 /bin/bash
 1419 pts/1    S      0:00 /bin/sh ./build.sh
 1423 pts/1    S      0:00 /bin/bash 
/home/landley/pending/newfirmware/make-stat
 1447 pts/1    D      0:04 tar xvjf 
/home/landley/pending/newfirmware/base/linux
 1448 pts/1    S      0:37 bzip2 -d
All I have to do is run my script, it tries to extract the kernel tarball, and 
tar hangs in D state.
How do I debug this?  (Is there some way to get the output of Ctrl-ScrLk to go 
to the log instead of just the console?  My system isn't currently hung, it's 
just got a process that is.  This process being hung prevents my partitions 
from being unmounted on shutdown, which is annoying.)
Other miscelanous bugs: cut and paste only works some of the time (it pastes 
blanks other times, dunno if this was -test5 or -mm2; it worked fine in 
-test4).
The key repeat problem is still there, although still highly intermittent.
The boot hung enabling swap space once.  I don't know why.  (Init was already 
running and everything...)
