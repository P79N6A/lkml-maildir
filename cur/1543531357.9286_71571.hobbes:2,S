Yes, so I surmised.

No offense intended, but isn't this a little lame?  We
cripple the NFS client because some servers are
broken?  Why not make a mount option for nfs that
specifies "use normal Linux (i.e. bsd) semantics" vs
"use server semantics (whatever they are".

You lost me here.

I didn't see any code like that in the two (admittedly
old) kernels I looked in.  Are these patches private
to you or are they included in a later kernel?
The reason I ask is that my preference (albeit only
marginally informed) is for this to be a per-mount
option, not a global one.  That way broken servers can
be dealt with without crippling ALL NFS mounts on a
given client.  If no one else is handling this, I
could take a whack at it (as a first kernel
project--I'm getting all tingly!)
