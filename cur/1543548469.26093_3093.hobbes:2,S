The thread group changes broke the signal handling in linuxthreads.
The CLONE_SIGHAND is now also used to enable thread groups but since
linuxthreads already used CLONE_SIGHAND and is not prepared for thread
groups all hell breaks loose.
I've told Linus several times about this problems but he puts out one
test release after the other without this fixed.
