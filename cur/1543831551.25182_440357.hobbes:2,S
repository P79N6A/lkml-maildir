Subject: [PATCH] pcmcia: update alloc_io_space for conflict checking for multifunction PC card for Linux kernel 2.6.15.4.

Hi,
Some PCMCIA cards do not mention specific IO addresses in the CIS.
In that case, inside the alloc_io_space function, conflicts are detected
(the function returns 1) for the second function of a multifunction card
unless the length of IO address range required is greater than 0x100.
The following patch will remove this conflict checking for a PCMCIA
function which had not mentioned any specific IO address to be mapped
from. 
The patch is tested for Linux kernel 2.6.15.4 and works fine in the
above case and is as suggested by Dave Hinds.
