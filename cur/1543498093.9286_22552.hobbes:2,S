    4 billion major numbers?
    I'd think a 12:20 split (and a 32-bit number, which has the
    advantage of being standard C and not depending on gcc or some
    yet-unapproved standard of the week) would be far more sensible
    for moderately-sized system (who is going to remember all of
    these major and minor numbers?  I'm still occasionally being
    bitten by the reworking of the ide1 major number) while something
    like devfs where the device drivers actually export their
    interfaces to userspace would be a more maintainable long-term
    solution.
