I have a lot of scheduler changes queued up and I view this change as being
not very high priority.  If someone sends a patch to update -mm then we can
run with that, however Ingo's auto-tuning seems a far preferable approach.

It's very, very late for this and subtle CPU scheduler regressions tend to
take a long time (weeks or months) to be identified.
