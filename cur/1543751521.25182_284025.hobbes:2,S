Hi Alan,

 - polling mode
 - coordinate polling
 - continuous mode (arch-dependent)
 - adjustable rpu/dpp settings
 - adjustable pressure current
 - adjustable sample settle delay
 - 4 and 5 wire touchscreens (5 wire is WM9712 only)
 - pen down detection
 - battery monitor
 - sample AUX adc's
 - power management
 - codec GPIO

Many thanks to Russell King, Vincent Sanders, Ian Molton and Andrew
Zabolotny for supplying patches, bug fixes and generally helping in the
development of the driver.
