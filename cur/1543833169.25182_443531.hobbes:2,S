Yes, this is true for users that pass GFP_ATOMIC to sa_query, at least.  But
might not be so for other users:  send_mad in sa_query actually gets gfp_flags
parameter, but for some reason it does not pass it to idr_pre_get, which means
even sa query done with GFP_KERNEL flag is likely to fail.
Sean, it seems we need something like the following - what do you think?
--
Avoid bogus out out memory errors: fix sa_query to actually pass gfp_mask
supplied by the user to idr_pre_get.
