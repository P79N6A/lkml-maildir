   Another thing that make me ill ;) is the fact that tcpdump screw up
   things while your proggy is running on the loopback device. Now I
   am going to debug _why_ this happens.
tcpdump sniffs the "wire", this means incoming and outgoing packets,
thus you are seeing loopback transmit and receive every frame.
If this bothers you write some sed script to uniqify the lines output
based upon timestamp or something like this.
