Hi,
I am using 2.6.23-rc9 with pata_sis. `modprobe -r sd_mod`, which I ran 
from initramfs, caused all my disks to spindown - sd even told me so.
I recall there has been talk a while back about whether to spin down 
disks on shutdown or not, but I do not think it touched the removal of 
sd_mod, did it? So either way, can someone fill me in why the spindown 
is done?
