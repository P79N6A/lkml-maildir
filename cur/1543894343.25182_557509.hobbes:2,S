I do not think that the 100% users will do kernel compiles all day like 
we do. We likely would prefer 4k page size for our small text files.

I never understood the point of that exercise. If you have variable page 
size then the 64k page size can be used specific to files that benefit 
from it. Typically usage scenarios are video audio streaming I/O, large 
picture files, large documents with embedded images. These are the major
usage scenarioes today and we suck the. Our DVD/CD subsystems are 
currently not capable of directly reading from these devices into the page 
cache since they do not do I/O in 4k chunks.

Every 64k block contains more information and the number of pages managed
is reduced by a factor of 16. Less seeks , less tlb pressure , less reads, 
more cpu cache and cpu cache prefetch friendly behavior.
