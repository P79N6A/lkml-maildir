After just written that, I got a real problem. There was a power loss a few minutes ago,
and I think when hdd was active. Trying to boot 2.4.7 kernel I got a message about
replaying journal, then hdd error:
hdd: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }                    
hdd: dma_intr: error=0x40 { UncorrectableError }, LBAsect=84415, sector=36216  
and kernel panic. Please note that I mount root read-write with this kernel.
Then I rebooted 2.2.19 kernel (which mounts root as read-only if that matters):
Checking ReiserFS transaction log (device 16:42) ...
Warning, log recovery starting on readonly filesystem
hdd: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdd: dma_intr: error=0x40 { UncorrectableError }, LBAsect=84415, sector=36216
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:42 (hdd), sector 36216
Replayed 33 transactions in 6 seconds
Using r5 hash to sort names
...
ReiserFS version 3.5.32
VFS: Mounted root (reiserfs filesystem) readonly.
and system booted normally.
Now I rebooted back to 2.4.7 and everything seems to be OK.
So what to do now? Run badblocks? Change disk? Any suggestions?

Nerijus
