There are two things that the SCHED_ISO you tried is not that SCHED_FIFO 
is - As you mentioned there is no priority support, and it is RR, not 
FIFO. I am not sure whether it is one and or the other responsible. Both 
can be added to SCHED_ISO. I haven't looked at jackd code but it should 
be trivial to change SCHED_FIFO to SCHED_RR to see if RR with priority 
support is enough or not. Second the patch I sent you is fine for 
testing; I was hoping you would try it. What you can't do with it is 
spawn lots of userspace apps safely SCHED_ISO with it - it will crash, 
but it not take down your hard disk. I've had significantly better 
results with that patch so far. Then we cn take it from there.
Cheers,
Con
