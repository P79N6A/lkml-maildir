The problem now is that this becomes filesystem dependant.
Some of the filesystems will already have the inode loaded, and
if the inode is loaded, then the first block of the file is also loaded.
If the proposed readahead is done at the VFS level then multiple
reads will be issued for the same block, with some physical IO
reduction done due to cache hits.
This is starting to sound like a bit of overoptimization.
Still.. Try it. and on different filesystems and see what happens.
