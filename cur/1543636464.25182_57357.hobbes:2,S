Hi Linus,
	People complained that Art's patches messed up their pretty
whitespacing: heaven forbid I should disrespect good whitespace.  I
wrote a new script which preserves spaces (even tabs which would be
misaligned by adding the ' =' chars).  Unfortunately, the patch for
the whole kernel is 2MB, touching about 20,000 initializers, so I'm
going to be passing patches through various maintainers in the next
few days.  For the curious, the patches are at the normal location:
http://www.xx.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rusty/Initializers
Thanks!
Rusty.
