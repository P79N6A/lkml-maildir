Yes of course, the spinlock regions still have to be analyzed and both
patches have to be maintained for that.  Long duration spinlocks are bad
by any measure, and have to be dealt with anyway.

That's not correct.  For one thing, you don't know that no task is eating
CPU, or that nobody is hogging the kernel.  Look at the above, and consider
the part about the little lags between IOs.

This is exactly the case that -preempt handles well.  On the other hand,
trying to show that scheduling hacks satisfy any given latency bound is
equivalent to solving the halting problem.
I thought you had done some real time work?

A price lots of people are willing to pay.
By the way, have you measured the cost of -preempt in practice?
