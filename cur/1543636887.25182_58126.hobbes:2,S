Well that was intentional, although I confess to not having
put a lot of thought into the decision.  The user wants
O_DIRECT and we cannot do that.  The CPU has to clear the
memory by hand.  Bad.
Obviously it's easy enough to put in the code to clear the
memory out.  Do you think that should be done?

OK, thanks.  Presumably XFS has a fairly heavyweight get_block()?
I'd be interested in seeing just how expensive that O_DIRECT
I/O is, and whether we need to get down and implement a
many-block get_block() interface.  Any numbers/profiles
available?
