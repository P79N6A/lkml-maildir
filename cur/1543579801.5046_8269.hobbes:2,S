I must admit I'm a bit sceptical - apart from anything else, Jeff's
approach allows a bug in the server software to blow the whole OS away,
instead of just quietly coring! (Or, worse still, trample on some FS
metadata in RAM... eek!) A TUX module would be a nice idea, although I
haven't even been able to find a proper TUX web page - Google just gave
page after page of mailing list archives and discussion about it :-(
