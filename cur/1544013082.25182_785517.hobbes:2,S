While it can be workarounded manually using "ide_core.nodma" we should really
be aiming at ease of use for the end users and always let the code handle such
issues automatically if possible.

True.  However it should be possible to handle it correctly by adding the
DMA quirk to the respective host drivers (seems to be via82cxxx.c in case of
IEI PCISA-C3/EDEN).
Kirill, could you please look into adding such quirk to via82cxxx instead?
[ It seems the best place to add it would be via_init_one() as we could just
  clear host DMA masks (please also remember to first check if the controller
  is an external one -- for VIA it could only be VT6410).  BTW it should be
  possible to greatly simplify DMI checking by using dmi_check_system() helper
  similarly how it's already done for cable detection in via82cxxx. ]
Sergei, care to handle AMD Geode GX2 case?
Thanks,
