But we do want to allow forced COW faults for MAP_PRIVATE mappings. gdb
uses this for inserting breakpoints (but fortunately, a COW page in a
MAP_PRIVATE mapping is a much more natural thing for the VM).

I think you're right -- VM_MAYSHARE is basically testing for MAP_SHARED.
I just don't know exactly what you're proposing here.
Thanks,
