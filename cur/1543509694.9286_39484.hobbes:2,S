0.0.2 over the weekend is the plan.  I've fixed all of the known bugs
except for one, but that one requires a bit of a reworking of how I
track committed buffers which are still needed by the transaction code.
Once that is done I expect to have a version which is pretty stable
against the 2.2.2 kernel.  I already have a 2.2.12 version of the 0.0.1
code done so merging the 2.2.2 fixes into the 2.2.12 stream should not
be hard.

Currently the released journaling code journals everything, including
data.  That is deliberate: journaling metadata only turns out to be
_lots_ more complex (hint---what happens if you delete a block of
metadata and reallocate it as data or vice-versa), so although all of
the necessary support is there in the journaling layers, the released
ext3 code does not do metadata-only journaling yet.
Once people have had a chance to thrash out any bugs left in the 0.0.2
code, I'll enable the metadata-only journaling and we can all watch the
pretty fireworks as filesystems all over the planet explode in a curious
and interesting manner...
