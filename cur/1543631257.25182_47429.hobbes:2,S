I wouldnt get too carried away with these. Once the IDE core is clean
enough to allow hot plugging of IDE interfaces those __init's are all going
to need changing anyway
(and yes you can get hot pluggable IDE setups already - the mobility stuff
 for example has a case with a PCI split bridge, 3 or 4 PCI slots and
 connects to the cardbus on a laptop)
