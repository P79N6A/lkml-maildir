The behaviour varies a bit anyway because there's a cache...

I don't have figures on that, but I do know people have complained about it
for non-cached conditions.

likely to reflect the client machine than would the NIS map for the NFS
automounts.  You wouldn't necessarily want to store this table in NIS.
