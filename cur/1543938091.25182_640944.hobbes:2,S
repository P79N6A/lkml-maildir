Hi Jon,

This wording is a bit excessive. The errors were not being ignored,
only the error code was replaced with a less informative -1. Still,
that's a good fix, although totally unrelated with the patch set it was
hiding into. The only question I have is:

Is this last chunk a cleanup or a bugfix? It seems that NO_IRQ can have
value 0 or -1 depending on the architecture, so your change is real on
some architectures.
I have to admit that I'm a bit confused by the way IRQs are handled by
this driver. On the one hand, there is code to handle polled-mode:
static int i2c_wait(struct mpc_i2c *i2c, unsigned timeout, int writing)
{
	(...)
	if (i2c->irq == 0)
	{
		(...)
	} else {
		/* Interrupt mode */
But on the other hand the initialization code bails out if the platform
device doesn't provide an IRQ:
static int fsl_i2c_probe(struct platform_device *pdev)
{
	(...)
	i2c->irq = platform_get_irq(pdev, 0);
	if (i2c->irq < 0) {
		result = -ENXIO;
		goto fail_get_irq;
	}
So it seems to me like the polling mode code is never actually used?
Unless some platforms include an "empty" IRQ in their device
definition. Which indeed seems to be the case... but then they set the
IRQ to 0, NOT to NO_IRQ, so I'm wondering if the change you propose is
really correct.
Either way, there are more places in the driver where the IRQ is
compared to 0, so if your change is correct, it should be applied
consistently. Thus I will revert this part for the time being, if any
change is really needed with regards to interrupts in this driver,
please send a separate patch. But please double-check first, as I said
above it's trickier than it looks.
