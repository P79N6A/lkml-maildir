Ok.  Then my sympathies, I can understand what a difficult position
this places you in.  A global pidspace resembling the one you have now
is the one idea that has been consistently shot down in all of the
discussions.  So I doubt anything short of a miracle could get it
merged in the short term. 
I am fairly certain that everyone who has existing management code at
this point will find it needs modifications to work with whatever
version is merged into the mainstream kernel.
