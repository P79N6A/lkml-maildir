Do you mean MUST NOT or MIGHT NOT?
Unless POSIX is much more clear than Unix98, I'd say fileutils
is OK. Unix98 says that the "mv utility will perform actions
equivalent to the XSH specification rename() function", but does
not seem to restrict rename() and mv operation very much.
If mv is interrupted, it will leave at least one intact file.
It may leave an incomplete file too.
Look at this:
       When files are duplicated to another file system, the
       implementation may require that the process invoking mv
       has read access to each file being duplicated.
Note the "may". You could have a setuid-root mv command or a system
call that handles the problem in some special way.
