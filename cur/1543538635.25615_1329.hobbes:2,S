Heya,
I've been through the same problems with you with this ISP. I tried
literally everything but with 2.0.x it works just fine, changing the kernel
to 2.2.x it stopped working.
I removed Linux from the computer and installed Mandrake 7.1 from scratch...
and now it works like a dream.
I can only assume as a result that it is a user space problem (I have some
friends in the US who have also had problems with Linux 2.2 and specific
ISPs)...
John
