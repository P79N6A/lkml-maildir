Could you please clarify as to what "that layer" means - is it the
firmware/hardware for virtualization? or does it refer to user space?
With virtualization the linux kernel would end up acting as a hypervisor
and resource management support like per-container RSS support needs to
be built into the kernel.
It would also be useful to have a resource controller like per-container
RSS control (container refers to a task grouping) within the kernel or
non-virtualized environments as well.
