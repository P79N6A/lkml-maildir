Agreed.

Most users I know using this watchdog are using it on an hosted
dedicated server, for which the boot messages are not available.
Aborting because of the watchdog triggering during fsck would not be
easily spottable. I prefer to err on the safe side from the user point
of view, even though I guess what you see as being "on the safe side"
would be to keep the watchdog enabled :)
