Subject: [patch 00/10] [PATCH] Create instrumentation/ kernel directory
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
Since we already have the Instrumentation menu in
kernel/Kconfig.instrumentation and instrumentation code all over the
kernel tree:
arch/*/oprofile/*.c
kernel/kprobes.c
arch/*/kernel/kprobes.c
kernel/marker.c
kernel/profile.c
kernel/lockdep.c
vm/vmstat.c
block/blktrace.c
We could move them to
instrumentation/
arch/*/instrumentation/
Therefore, we could also move the kprobes and marker samples under
instrumentation/samples/
I submit these patches for review/comments, especially about kernel build
integration. instrumentation/ is currently a core-y and arch/*/instrumentation/
is a drivers-y because of oprofile.
Mathieu
