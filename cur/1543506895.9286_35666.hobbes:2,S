I had applied this patch to my 2.0 kernel, through 2.0.37 with mostly
success, but there is a problem at times when some disk blocks are in
cache and some aren't.  In this case, the system hangs since I think the
request to start the drive is never sent.  It would be nice to finally
get this in the kernel and properly maintained...
Cheers, Andreas
