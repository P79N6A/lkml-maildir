So mounting opens it in blocking  mode, causing it to lock, but pktcdvd 
does not open it in blocking mode, so it doesn't get locked until the 
mount?  Why does the cdrom driver differentiate between the two?  
Shouldn't it simply be locked when in use, no matter how it is used?  
And shouldn't pktcdvd explicitly unlock the drive when the pktcdvd 
device isn't open?  For that matter, why is mount opening the cdrom in 
blocking mode?  Shouldn't the filesystem be sending down async bios?
