Hello all!
Sorry to spam the list with a diff but I tried to send this to Linus directly
but got no response in any way until now. So before this gets lost I thought I
repost it here. It would be really great if the attached diffs would make it
into final 2.4.
Following is the mail I sent to Linus which gives a short description of the
diffs.
Regards
  nils

Hello Linus!
Find attached a new version of my i810/i815 TCO watchdog driver. The last
version V0.01 you got from Alan Cox had a problem with some boards which is now
fixed along with some other minor changes.
Since I did not see that V0.01 was included in any kernel images I attach the
complete diff against 2.3.99-pre9. The driver itself compiles and works cleanly
for any kernel from 2.2.14 to 2.3.99-pre9 and 2.4.0-test5. For 2.4.0-test5 I
have attached an extra diff for you making it easier to include it (which I
sincerely hope ;)
Also attached is a diff for 2.4.0-test5 serial.c. It initializes info->ACR
before trying to detect the port and which is used in serial_icr_read() and
would else be uninitialized (it gets set to wake up the port but this is only
done when opening the port, not for probing for it).
In case of any problems with the diffs, please contact me.
Regards
  nils faerber
