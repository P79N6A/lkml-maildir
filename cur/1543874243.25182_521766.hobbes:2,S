Based just on what I see right here I agree it seems like we would want
to store a ref to the pid, not store the pid_nr(pid) output, so in this
context it is suspicious.
OTOH if you're saying that using pid_nr(task_pid(current)) anywhere
should always be 'wrong', then please explain why, as I think we have a
disagreement on the meanings of the structs involved.  In other words,
at some point I expect the only way to get a "pid number" out of a task
would be using this exact idiom, "pid_nr(task_pid(current))".
