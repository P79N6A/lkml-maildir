The particular system I am working with is a Via EPIA M-6000, which is
quite new but has a 600Mhz CPU due to it being fanless.  I would imagine
this would put it closer to a 'modern system' in this regard, as it uses
DDR266.

Yes, this would be a nice improvement.

But the current behavior only causes latency problems for an IDE system,
so if this were made runtime-tunable then it would only be an issue for
SATA, right?  This would cover 99.9% of audio users, who would gladly
trade some disk throughput for lower latency.  You can record a *lot* of
tracks with even a few MB/s of disk throughput.
