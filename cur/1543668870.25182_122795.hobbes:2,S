Umm no.  The fact that a VMA is "mapping" the page doesn't
mean the page is resident in any page tables.   For example,
think about the MAP_PRIVATE mapping of the relocation tables
from libc.so ... every process will have its own, modified,
copy of that data.  The original page might not be mapped by
the page tables of any processes.

It will for some cases (as shown above), but I agree that for
most common situations objrmap and pte rmap should have very
similar algorithmic complexity in the pageout path.

There is one common situation where objrmap is O(N^2) while
pte rmap is only O(N).  However, this case isn't interesting
because this workload tends to run mlocked anyway.
This is, of course, Oracle on 32 bit systems with gazillions
of windows into the larger-than-virtual-memory shared memory
area.
This aspect of Oracle can be special-cased with remap_file_pages
and the reverse mapping can be skipped alltogether since Oracle's
shared memory area should (IMHO) be mlocked anyway.
In short, I agree with you that we probably want object rmap for
all the common cases.
cheers,
Rik
