Wouldn't it be easier for you to keep them up to date if sections 2, 4, 
and parts of 5 were included in the kernel source tree?  Documentation 
updates could be enforced as part of the patch process--all you'd have 
to do is NAK patches that modified userland interfaces if they didn't 
contain documentation updates (and I'm sure others would help you with 
that task).
Likewise with the glibc stuff.  Doesn't it belong with the glibc project?  
Wouldn't that make more sense, both from a packaging and maintenance 
perspective?
Either way, thanks a lot for keeping the pages in good shape, it's much 
appreciated.
Thanks,
Jesse
