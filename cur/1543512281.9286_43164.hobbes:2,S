   However this also has me wondering why FFS support hasn't been
   included in the Linux kernel.  I would have thought that with the
   need for a journaling filesystem FFS would have been adopted,
   especially with the BSD code available.  Is there some issue that
   has prevented this?
FFS by itself does not imply journaling, Linux does support FFS
already (read-only, write support is there but experimental).
