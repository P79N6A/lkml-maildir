We have to be careful about this because MODULE_LICENSE("Public domain")
doesn't mean anything if the resulting code is then shipped binary only.
GPL and additional rights is probably closest or even just a
/*
 *	When linked into the Linux kernel the resulting work is GPL, you
 *	are however free to use this work under other licenses if you
 *	so wish. See README.blah
 */
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");	/* When part of Linux */
