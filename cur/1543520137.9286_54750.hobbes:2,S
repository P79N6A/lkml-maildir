Why do you need to avoid entering the kernel?  Kernel entry+exit is on
the order of 1 microsecond.

That seems reasonable if you're moving a lot of data.

Ew.  99.9% reliable.

How small does your latency have to be?
Two clean solutions with ~200us + inter-fragment fill and interrupt
latency:
  - An ioctl() "wait until audio device is ready to read".  Are you
    aware that recent work gets SCHED_FIFO wakeup latency reliably
    within "+/-200usecs" on someone's x86 box so you shouldn't need to
    busy wait for a pattern in a pattern buffer?
  - Instead of busy waiting on a pattern, have the kernel update an
    mmaped byte counter (read-only to user space).  Then you just wait
    for the counter to pass a certain value.
They both rely on interrupts from the sound hardware on completion of
each fragment of course, which implies inter-fragment latency.  You
can't chase the hardware fill word by word this way.
