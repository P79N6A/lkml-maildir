The way I see it, it stems from simply a different expectation of
MS_ASYNC semantics, rather than exactly what the app is doing.
If there are no data integrity requirements, then the writing should
be left up to the VM. If there are, then there will be a MS_SYNC,
which *will* move those hundred megs to the IO layer so there is no
reason for MS_ASYNC *not* to get it started earlier (and it will
be more efficient if it does).
The semantics your app wants, in my interpretation, are provided
by MS_INVALIDATE. Which kind of says "bring mmap data into coherence
with system cache", which would presumably transfer dirty bits if
modified (though as an implementation detail, we are never actually
incoherent as far as the data goes, only dirty bits).
At this point the best I can do is agree to disagree if you are
still not convinced and I'll leave it to Linux to keep debating it.
We reached something of an agreement on the fadvise thing at least.
Thanks,
Nick
