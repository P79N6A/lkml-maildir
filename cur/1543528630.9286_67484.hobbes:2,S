	Just as a data point, I got loads of these badcrc errors with
	my ALI M1533 rev. 0x20 controller up to kernel 2.2.12, I think
	(using André's patches) and the result was that I couldn't use
	any kind of DMA with my hardware (in fact, I could use with my
	Fujitsu drive, but could not use with any of my Quantum HDs).
	Then suddenly, with 2.2.13 (I think), André's patches worked
	and I'm using them since that time, "happily" with MultiWord
	DMA (what's the difference between mword DMA and UDMA, BTW?)
	I haven't changed the cable nor anything else. So, I guess
	that the drivers you're using also make a lot of a difference,
	not only the cables, controllers, and drives.
	[]s, Roger...
