Just a heads up,
I had the same panic and screen error with a 2.6.9 PIII SMP system
acting as an NFS client. This was after downgrading from a 2.6.10 kernel
that was panic'ing in the same way. I reverted to 2.6.8 but left the
Server (also a PIII SMP system) running 2.6.9. This occurred during
moderate to heavy NFS activity. The patch referenced in
http://seclists.org/lists/linux-kernel/2005/Jan/1237.html
 appeared to
resolve the panic with 2.6.10, but I was having strange things happen,
like failing to release file locks when the client reboots. This is a
production system and needs to be available for users. I am currently
trying to piece together another smp box to test with. I will post more
if I can duplicate the problem on demand.
We have a duplicate system that is not SMP that has not shown any of
these problems. That might be by chance though...
Hope this info is useful,
Stu Sheldon
