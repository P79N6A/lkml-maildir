It probably does, yet the code is received (so I can assign any command to
that key).
Here's the section from lirc_igorplugusb.c
(ftp.gnu.org/tmp/linux-libre-fsf2_2.6.28/linux-2.6.28/ubuntu/lirc/lirc_igorplugusb/lirc_igorplugusb.c)
that displays the message:
--
		if (ir->buf_in[2] != 0) {
			printk(DRIVER_NAME "[%d]: Device buffer overrun.\n",
				ir->devnum);
			/* start at earliest byte */
			i = DEVICE_HEADERLEN + ir->buf_in[2];
			/* where are we now? space, gap or pulse? */
		}
--
With my limited C knowledge I don't see what would prevent displaying the
key code (when I run irw) after the message. Haven't tried removing it
though.
Also checked with 3 different remote controls, the result is all the same.
