A lot of people call mark_buffer_dirty() on one or two buffers. Things
like file creation etc. Think about inode bitmap blocks that are marked
dirty with the superblock held.. Ugh.

The point being that because _everybody_ should do this, we shouldn't have
the "mark_buffer_dirty()" that we have. There are no really valid uses of
the automatic rebalancing: either we're writing meta-data (which
definitely should balance on its own _after_ the fact), or we're writing
normal data (which already _does_ balance after the fact).
Right now, the automatic balancing only hurts. The stuff that hasn't been
converted is probably worse off doing balancing when they don't want to,
than we would be to leave the balancing altogether.
Which is why I don't like it.
