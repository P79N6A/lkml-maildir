Ok, so you still favor using a distinct attribute name for SELinux
attributes.  Andreas Gruenbacher had suggested during the earlier thread
that we use something like the xattr_trusted.c attribute handler, so
that a single xattr handler would cover all security modules but each
security module could have its own attribute name (security.selinux,
security.dte, security.capabilities, etc).  As I explained during that
thread, I don't think we want to use the trusted attribute handler
itself due to its permission checking model, but it would be easy to
make the xattr_security.c handler more like xattr_trusted.c in terms of
allowing arbitrary extensions of a "security." prefix.  Is that more to
your liking, or do you truly want a separate handler for each security
module?  I see the latter as undesirable as it requires each security
module to separately reserve a name and an index in each filesystem.
