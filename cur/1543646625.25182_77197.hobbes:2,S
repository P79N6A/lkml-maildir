If this is a concern, it actually appears that BK has the capability to
"enforce" a license, in that I coul dmake BK aware of the GPL and that
would cause BK to pop up a window saying "Do you agree to this license"  
before the first check-in by a person (the same way it asked you whether 
you wanted to allow openlogging).
Do people feel that would be a good idea? I actually dismissed it when 
Larry talked about it, because I felt people might take it as another "too 
much BK in your face", even though the license would be the _Linux_ 
license, not the BK one.
