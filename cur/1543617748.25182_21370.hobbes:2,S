it's merely an oversight.
in the long term i think the correct approach would be to always store the
logical CPU number in p->cpu. Architectures that have some strange
physical numbering can always do a mapping themselves. This way we could
remove tons of cpu-id conversions from the generic code. And we are always
going to have these problems, now that the x86 SMP boot code renumbers
physical CPU ids to match the logical order.
i've checked the architectures, and besides your architecture it appears
that only Alpha does a non-identity ID conversion. So it would be much
cleaner for the generic kernel if we stored the logical CPU id in p->cpu,
and all SMP interfaces towards lowlevel SMP code used the logical CPU ID.
