See linux-mm. We just went through a series of tests and functionality 
wise it worked just fine.

This is commonly discussed under the subject of memory hotplug.

Yes this is a new way of using cpusets but it works and we could fix the 
scalability issues rather than adding new subsystems.

New node?

Hmmmm... Thats is interesting.

I think we should have one container mechanism instead of multiple. Maybe 
merge the two? The cpuset functionality is well established and working 
right.
