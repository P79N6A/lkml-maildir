Ok, I've found the bug, it is in fb_open() in drivers/video/fbmem.c, it
needs this addition:
        if(fbidx >= FB_MAX)
                return -ENODEV;
Without it, large minor numbers result in access beyond the end of
registered_fb.
On Debian, ls /dev/fb[67] results in:
crw--w--w-    1 root     tty       29, 192 Nov 30  2000 /dev/fb6
crw--w--w-    1 root     tty       29, 224 Nov 30  2000 /dev/fb7
On Red Hat this is: 
crw-------    1 root     root      29,   7 Apr 11  2002 /dev/fb7
crw-------    1 root     root      29,   8 Apr 11  2002 /dev/fb8
Which explains why many don't see this bug.
