No, the code is correct. 0 means "don't stop the cpu".
The pm_idle function pointer will return to cpu_idle()
(arch/i386/kernel/process.c), and that function contains another
    while(!current->need_resched)
        idle();
loop ;-)

Yes, I'll correct that.

I'm not sure - what if the computer is just a router?
But OTHO: the cpu is idle, so it doesn't matter at all if the idle cpu
spends it's time within schedule() or within safe_hlt(), I'll change my
patch.
I have another question:
I added cpu_is_idle() into <linux/interrupt.h>. Is that acceptable, or
is there a better header file for such a function?
