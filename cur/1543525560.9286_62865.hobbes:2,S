Actually I have tried 'od -x' the file sample.au, and saw all 0x7f
there.
Whether AU or linear mode it supports, the file should not be all 0x7f 
(zero magnitude, I think), right ?
Also, though maybe some tools can record in linear mode, ViaVoice might 
not.  Actually ViaVoice has also tried to adjust my mic volumn to get 
suitable input voltage, but it always fails in this test.
So I still doubt there is sth wrong with the card or the driver.
I'll find some recording tools.  Anybody would recommend some ?
Thanks,
