Now that we hare half converted yes it is a bug.

This is true in practice.  It isn't necessarily true, as all of irq_chip
structures are arch specific.  It would be silly to start using msi interrupts
without converting to genirq though.  So I think this covers it for ia64.
Your patch only fixes 2 spots and there is a third in irq_ia64.c that
needs to be fixed as well.  At least in linus's tree.
