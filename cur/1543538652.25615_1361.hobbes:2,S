On the 1850R's atleast, setting OS&nbsp;to Unixware locks the SMP&nbsp;spec
in at 1.1, configing anything other than Unixware 7 will set the SMP spec
to 1.4.
<p>You should have a "Smart Start" CD, which will give you more granularity
when it comes to configuring your Compaq BIOS.
<p>There are other changes as well that the "OS&nbsp;setting" controls,
unfortunatly, I don't remember off hand what exactly they are.&nbsp; There
are some PCI&nbsp;bus specifics in there, if I remember correctly... Something
about "Hot Add" of resources perhaps?
<p>Thanks,
<p>Jeff

<p>Some BIOS(es) fail to put a usable address in the PCI registers for
<br>some devices. For instance, if you have a shared-memory buffer that
<br>is Nk in length, it must be on a Nk boundary! Some BIOSes ignore this
<br>which may prevent the first portion of an allocated buffer from being
<br>addressed. See if you can get a BIOS upgrade. If not, see if your driver
<br>can take a parameter (using append=) from LILO.
