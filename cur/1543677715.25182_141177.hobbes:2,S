   Read the hotplug thread to see how Linus
   said, he will never add a binary event daemon interface.
Funny, rtnetlink is exactly this and it is in the tree :-)
Every networking configuration event is transmitted over
rtnetlink sockets to all listeners, in a fixed binary
format.
What Linus doesn't want is this for configuration events,
ie. things like "device appears" not "my ethernet burped"
