Ivan,
   I tried a couple variations of the patch above.  It got me further, 
but I still wasn't getting the base address assigned properly.  I 
suspected a bad card, so I tried another one I have here.  It is likely 
that I have been fighting with bad hardware all this time.  The other 
card has a known device ID, a proper class code, and does not give 
resource allocation errors.  I have an e-mail into D-Link to inquire 
about the buggy card.
   I appreciate both yours and Jesse's help to troubleshoot this problem.
Best Regards,
Wayne Sherman
