Thanks, we agree completely.  It's actually an impossible problem
for a program since it requires semantic knowledge of the content
under revision control.  And even then the program can get it wrong
(think about a change which shortens the depth of the stack followed by
a change that won't work with the old stack depth, now you export that
to the other tree and it breaks yet it worked in the first tree).

That's trivial to do, we already have a 'bk export -tpatch -r<rev>' which
does the patch part.  Combine that with 'bk changes -vr<rev>' and you have
what you are talking about on the sending side.  On the receiving side
we have 'bk import -tpatch' and 'bk comments' which do the other half.
