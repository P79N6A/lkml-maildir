Hi, Pete!
Next time you are asking my opinion please cc: me, so that I can quote
you.
Yes, I think you have fixed a terrible bug in ymfpci. Decoding only 10-bit
addresses is extremely dangerous, considering that only 388-38b is
reserved, while 788-78b etc are not.
In order to get your patch accepted sooner please use symbolic constants
and better indentation. I don't want to steal your credits by doing it for
you :-)
If you want to play further with APM and ymfpci, I made a stub for proper
apm support in the ymfpci driver. It's available here:

You may need to save some data in memory when the system goes to suspend
and restore them afterwards. I believe that the PCI config space should be
saved by BIOS. Everything else is the responsibility of the driver.
If I find a similar problem in ALSA it will be reported with cc: to you.
