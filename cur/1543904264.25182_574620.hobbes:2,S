Ray has been the first one to offer (thank you), and yes I have asked
him for precise details of info to collect to hopefully work out what
is happening with his first problem.
For the general "it feels better for me" it is harder, but not as hard
as CPU scheduler. We can measure various types of IO waits, swap in/out
events, swap prefetch events and successfulness; see what happens to
those as we change swappiness or vfs_cache_pressure etc.
