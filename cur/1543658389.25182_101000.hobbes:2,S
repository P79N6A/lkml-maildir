That's similar to how we've been operating for LTT for a while now. The
kernel buffers are allocated using rvmalloc and mmapped to user-space.
When the daemon needs to dump to file, it issues a write using the pointer
to the mmapped area. There's no data crossing the user-kernel interface
at any point. It's a zero-copy system. This way, we've been able to handle
mutli-MB buffers very efficiently (and on fast machines MB trace buffers
fill very fast).

Great, glad you're interested.
