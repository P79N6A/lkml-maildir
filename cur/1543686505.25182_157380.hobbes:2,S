I'm not sure but i think most of those look like multiple
pci devices rather than one device with multiple functions.
I've got an Initio 9520UW: One PCI card with two ini9x00 UW
SCSI HBAs sharing one interrupt and one EEPro100 on another
interrupt.  During scan it seems to me to be three devices
sitting behind a bridge.
This is on 2.4.18 so 2.6 may look a little different.
