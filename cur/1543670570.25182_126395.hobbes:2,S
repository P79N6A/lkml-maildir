    Please make the argument for mknod/mknod64 __u32/__u64.  And I
    don't think adding the syscall makes sense before the internal
    dev_t representation has changed.
Yes, there is a dozen rather uninteresting patches that can
be applied any moment. But a new system call is more important,
so I show it in public at some earlier stage, so that Linus and
others, like you, can comment.
Yesterday or the day before Linus preferred __u32 etc for this
loopinfo64 ioctl, so I did it that way. Here, since mknod is a
traditional Unix system call, I am still inclined to prefer
(unsigned) int above __u32.  Of course it doesn't matter much.
