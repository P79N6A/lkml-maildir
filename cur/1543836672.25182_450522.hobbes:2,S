i can't understand when atime is *ever* reliable... root doing backups 
with something like rsync will cause atimes to change.  (and it can't 
save/restore the atime without race conditions.)
you can work around mutt's silly dependancy on atime by configuring it 
with --enable-buffy-size.  so far mutt is the only program i've discovered 
which cares about atime.
also -- i wasn't aware that xfs tried to do a better job with atime
updates... i'm not sure it's really that effective.  i've got a
busy shell/mail/web server, and here's a typical 60s sample with
noatime,nodiratime on xfs:
Device:    rrqm/s wrqm/s   r/s   w/s   rsec/s   wsec/s avgrq-sz avgqu-sz   await  svctm  %util
sda          0.00   0.77 13.72 25.94   418.34   328.72    18.84     2.21   55.75   3.63  14.40
and a typical 60s sample with atime,diratime:
sda          0.07   0.58 15.82 35.87   472.13   412.52    17.12     0.70   13.56   3.54  18.30
that's been my experience in general... an extra 15 to 20% iops required 
to maintain atime... just for mutt...  no thanks :)
(btw there's nvram underneath sda, so the await change isn't too 
surprising.)

p.s. lazyatime sounds like a nice hack to make mutt work too.
