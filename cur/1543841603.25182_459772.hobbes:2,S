True.  Marginally better than horrible then. :)

Absolutely.  Assuming that select gets removed in the process, and
concentrating on oldconfig, would it be enough to have something like
this in the .config?
# CONFIG_USB_STORAGE has unmet dependencies: CONFIG_SCSI, CONFIG_BLOCK
Now people looking for usb mass storage can find the option without
grepping through Kconfig files, but also every single driver for every
single disabled subsystem shows up.  Might be a bit too much.
