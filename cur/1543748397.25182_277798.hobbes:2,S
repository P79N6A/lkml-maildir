Subject: [PATCH] ppc64: Correct alignment for lppaca in paca_struct

Hi Andrew,
I think this is 2.6.10 material, as well as lparcfg it fixes a nasty 
bug in our shared processor support (some cpus fail to recognise they
are in shared processor mode).

From: Will Schmidt <willschm@us.ibm.com>
We found that we were failing register_vpa calls in cases where the lppaca
structure (part of the PACA) crosses a page boundary.
This was causing us (lparcfg specifically) some grief as the xSharedProc bit 
was not being set.
The attached patch changes the alignment of the lppaca structure, and a few 
comments so we understand why.
