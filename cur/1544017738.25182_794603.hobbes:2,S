And the difference between 64 and IPV4+TCP header len becomes the
payload, don't you see? :-)
myri10ge just pulls min(64, skb->len) bytes from the SKB frags into
the linear area, unconditionally.  So a small number of payload bytes
can in fact end up there.
Otherwise Willy could never have triggered this bug.
