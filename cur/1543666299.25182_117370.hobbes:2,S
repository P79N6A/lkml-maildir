Below is the script that I used to pivot from a standard ramdisk (for with
the infrastructure is already in place in our build environment) to a tmpfs
filesystem.  This requires no changes to the boot args.
This script runs as /sbin/init, sets up the tmpfs filesystem, pivots, and
hands off control to the real init program.
One interesting bit is the rework of fstab so that mount and df show the
root filesystem as tmpfs.  freeramdisk simply tells the kernel that its
okay to give up the space used by the ramdisk.
This seems to work fine, though it isn't actually in production yet, just
a private prototype.

#!/bin/bash
# Set up tmpfs filesystem as root and pivot into it.
echo "Setting up tmpfs..."
#mount the tmpfs filesystem
mount -t tmpfs tmpfs mnt -o size=37M
#copy the initrd into the tmpfs filesystem
cp -a `ls -1 | grep -v mnt | grep -v proc | grep -v lost+found` mnt
#change dirs and make some directories
cd mnt
mkdir proc mnt
#pivot the filesystems
/sbin/pivot_root . mnt
#set up the /etc/fstab file to have / listed as tmpfs
#this will be used instead of the ramdisk line
