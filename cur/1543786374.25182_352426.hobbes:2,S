It is not really an issue of out-of-tree accounting package. The
system accounting is based on very old technology and needs improvement.
The issue we face is not an issue of one particular accounting package.
I think the best approach would be to wrap the mm usage accounting
in a new CONFIG_ENHANCED_SYS_ACCT and leave it OFF by default so that
people can still get the minimal accounting with
CONFIG_BSD_PROCESS_ACCT.
