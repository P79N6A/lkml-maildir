I found yesterday, that a -31 build in mode 4 seems to do something to 
ntpd, it fails startup, and floods the log with bad file descriptor 
messages.  I put some debugging echo's in the ntpd script but wasn't 
able to see any problems there.
So I'm back to -30, in mode 3 ATM, so tvtime works.  But everything 
else works far better in mode 4.
