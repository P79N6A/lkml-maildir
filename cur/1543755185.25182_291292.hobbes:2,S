Hi,
I have a Vaio C1MZX and in the lspci I saw this line:
0000:00:11.0 Non-VGA unclassified device: ALi Corporation M7101 Power
Management Controller [PMU]
So, I assumed it was a watchdog and I compiled with the option:
CONFIG_ALIM7101_WDT=m
But, when I do: modprobe alim7101_wdt
I get the following error message:
Jan 30 00:58:21 hermes vmunix: alim7101_wdt: Steve Hill
<steve@navaho.co.uk>.
Jan 30 00:58:21 hermes vmunix: alim7101_wdt: ALi 1543 South-Bridge does
not have the correct revision number (???1001?) - WDT
not set
What did I do wrong ?
If some patches need to be tried out, I volunteer. :)
Thanks in advance for you reply
