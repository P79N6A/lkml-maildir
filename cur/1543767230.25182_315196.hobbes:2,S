The only fast path that needs atomic_dec_if_positive is down_trylock.
You can use atomic_dec for down_trylock instead; the only downside to
that is that if somebody was holding the semaphore but nobody was
waiting, the holder will take the slow path when it does the up.  Or
you can use cmpxchg for down_trylock.  I believe that down_trylock is
used much less than down and down_interruptible, so it shouldn't
matter if down_trylock is a few nanoseconds slower than down.

What is "your machine"?  Is a single cmpxchg really slower than
locking and unlocking a spinlock?  If so, by how much?
