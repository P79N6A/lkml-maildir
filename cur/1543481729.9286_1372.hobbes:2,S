I've recently tried to install Slackware 3.5 in my PC.
Curiously, when I booting from the boot floppy starts the loading process,
but in
the middle of loading vmlinuz, the system reboots and then starts behaving
oddly (screen goes blank when it should begin checking the drives for the
boot sequence, etc.).
Why ???
I have this configuration...
AMD K6 200 Mhz (series B 9734BPF W)
64 Mb RAM
Motherboard IWILL P55XUW (Ultra Wide SCSI) see
http://www.iwillusa.com/products/P55xuw.htm
               MMX (Socket7) ready       
               from 166 to 233MHz ,166,200,233MHz ,from PR120 to PR233
                 Pentium processor up to 233MHz
                 AMD K6 processor up to 233MHz
                 Cyrix 6x86L CPU up to PR233MHz 
               Adaptec Ultra/Ultra Wide SCSI is embedded for great SCSI
connectivity
               P55XUB uses Adaptec AIC-7860 chip that supports PCI Ultra
SCSI(50 pin).
               The data transfer rate get up to 20MB/Sec. and is equivalent
to AHA 2940AU.

               Support Burst EDO(3.3V unbuffer) and SDRAM(Synchronous 3.3V
unbuffer) 
HD IBM DCAS.34330W (4,3 Gb)
CD-ROM Toshiba XM-3801TA (16x) SCSI
For the boot disk I have typed this command: RAWRITE aic7890.s A: and with
modules aha2x4x.s
I've seen that there are some problems with the AMD, although several people
are running AMD systems with no problem.
I haven't yet tried disabling the cache (please, PLEASE don't make me
disable the cache).
Can someone help me narrow down the possible cause of this sort of
error?  CPU?  Memory?  Cache?  BIOS? Kernel ?
Thanks very much !
