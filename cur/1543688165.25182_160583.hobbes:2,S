I had syslog send just *.info to vc/5 and though the *.info messages 
never make
it into syslog file, I started cp -aR /usr/src/kernel-source-2.6.0 /tmp 
with md/2 mounted
to /tmp and saw this *.info on vc/5 and then it locked up.  How about 
those zeros, skip,
assign id anyway?
journal_1037: journal_read_transaction, offset 3623, len 0 mount_id 0
journal_1039: journal_read_trans skipping because 3623 is too old
journal_1299: Setting newest_mount_id to 12
Anything?
