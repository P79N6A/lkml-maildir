Ah, okay -- that means that deflate compressor is pretty much useless.

Everything belongs in userspace... that makes it "wrong
enough". Userland and kernel programming is quite different, so any
improvements to suspend2 will be wasted, long-term. You'll make users
happy for now, but it means u-swsusp gets less users and less
developers, making "doing it right" slightly harder...
