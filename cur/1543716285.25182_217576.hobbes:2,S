User Mode Linux could definitely be an option for implementing
resource management, provided that the overhead can be kept
low enough.
For these purposes, "low enough" could be as much as 30%
overhead, since that would still allow people to grow the
utilisation of their server from a typical 10-20% to as
much as 40-50%.
