Can't reproduce this personally because I don't have SCSI and I don't have
a scanner...
Any clues?
Hello,
  Sorry if this is not the right address to report a bug in Venus, I
didn't find any other address...
  I found a bug, I think it is in the kernel. Here it is : I have a SCSI
Scanner with SCSI host adapter Adaptec 2940 Ultra.
    - the scanner works fine under Redhat 6.0 (kernel 2.2.5) and SuSE
6.1 (kernel 2.2.3)
    - it doesn't work under Venus (==Mandrake 6) (kernel 2.2.9)
    - it doesn't work anymore under Redhat 6.0 when I upgrade to kernel
2.2.11
  I think a bug was introduced in the kernel after version 2.2.5.
