We really have a disconnect.
Everytime command register is written to the drive see a new requst.
You are calling this a segment ??

Exclude DMAing.
When the sector_count register is set to a value smaller than the total
request entering, is that not truncating the IO?

How, the constaints are on 4k boundaries or a single page.
4k == 8-512byte sectors.

Okay, I see there is a lot more code in block to decode.
Because the assumption of the ISR's submitted is for exclusive ownership
of the request and buffer from head to tail for the duration of the
total request.  This asumption is similar to DMA executing and total
ownership until completing.  This may be a folly wrt to interfacing to the
block layer.

Wait, if the original request requires multiple executions of the command
block then they are separate requests.

One which interfaces to the hardware exactly, but it appears not possible.
One having the size of the total request and exclusive ownership be
mappable for the duration of the IO.
There are issues associated w/ the barrier down block and how to notify.
Thus owning the entire buffer exclusive for a flush cache barrier write is
needed and may be required.  Unless there is a way to notify based on the
LBA physical sector or "block" of the beginning of the error reported,
problems will arrise in journaling filesystems.  The rational for
maintaining ownership of an (attempted) ordered write and down block, the
hardware will not guarentee the data beyond the error returned from the
flush-cache command.

Yes but we can cross that path when I release the MMIO driver(s) and core.
So I will wander off and think some more, because I see your reference
frame now, but I wonder if you see mine.
