Where we run into inode number confusion is that all of
these shm segments are actually files on a tmpfs filesystem
somewhere, and by making the inode number the shmid we loose
the tmpfs inode number.  So it is possible we get tmpfs inode
number conflicts.  However the inode number is not used for
anything, and the files are not visible in any other way except
as shm segments so it doesn't matter.
There is another case with ipc namespaces where we ultimately need
to support duplicate shmids on the same machine (so migration
is a possibility).  However by and large the user space
processes with duplicate ids should be invisible to each other.

Having "SYSV" in the name appears mandatory.  Otherwise you
don't even know it is a shm file. Although I may be confused.

So I haven't changed anything here.  But I haven't really
looked either.
I don't have a clue if hugetlbfs files use the same device minor
number as tmpfs files.
Hmm.  Thinking about this I have just realized that we may want
to approach this a little differently.  Currently I am reusing
the dentry and inode structure that hugetlbfs and tmpfs return
me, and simply have a distinct struct file for each shm mapping.
There is a little more cost but it may actually make sense to have
a dentry and inode that is specific to shm.c so we can do whatever
we need to without adding requirements to the normal tmpfs or hugtlb
code.
