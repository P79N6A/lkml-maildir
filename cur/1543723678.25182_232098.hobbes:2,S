The keymap knows about 8 modifiers.
You can bind keys to simple modifiers, also to locking modifiers.
Your Czech keymap uses the Pause key as ShiftR_Lock.
(ShiftR is the 6th modifier, see also keymaps(5).)
Thus, while typing in the English state of the keyboard
you are using no modifiers unless explicitly pressing Shift/Alt/Ctrl/...
but when typing in the Czech state of the keyboard you are
permanently using ShiftR.
Now you press ScrollLock in the Czech state of the keyboard.
What happens is the action bound to ShiftR ScrollLock.
If no action is bound you may instead get the action bound
to Plain ScrollLock.
Investigate your keymap. If you understand, all is well.
If you don't understand, complain, e.g. to aeb@cwi.nl.
I am not aware of any recent changes in this area.
Your keymap is something of your own choice, not something
given by the kernel. See also loadkeys and dumpkeys.
