Hello,
As a follow-up to
<
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=119796120524618&w=2>
 (LKML seems
down right now so I am not linking to it), I have detected an important
problem with these two patches: after applying them by hand (downloaded
them raw from SGI's gitweb) on top of 2.6.24-rc5-git5 (they have not yet
been pulled into mainline by Linux as of this morning) for testing
purposes, I noticed upon reboot that "ls -l" on directories with many
files and subdirectories (around 5000 entries) takes several hundreds of
MB in RAM and then dies with "memory exhausted" error.
I also noticed that ldconfig takes a lot of time to complete, and
firefox seems also to eat much more memory than usual. Reverting the two
patches (going back to vanilla rc5-git5) makes these problems go away.
I am not able to test right now if only one of the patches is bogus or
if both of them are concerned.
As the symptoms are easy to reproduce, I guess this is some kind of
brown paper bag bug and will be easy for XFS experts to spot.
Best,
