Subject: sending selected git changesets from middle of set of cloned tree

Is there a way to send to mainline requests to pick up selected 
changesets from the middle of a git tree (another git tree on kernel.org 
in this case)?
I have two changsets (both one line fixes, but reasonably important ones)
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/sfrench/cifs-2.6.git;a=commit;h=f4cfd69cf349dd27e00d5cf804b57aee04e059c2
and
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/sfrench/cifs-2.6.git;a=commit;h=ef6724e32142c2d9ca252d423cacc435c142734e
without sending the whole tree (which includes another eight changesets 
some before and some after)?   After testing last week at the cifs 
plugfest, I would like to send these two in particular ASAP but want to 
wait on the other eight since it is so late in the rc cycle for 
mainline, and if I send them as diff/patches then I presumably would 
lose the changeset comments.
Is there a way to do a test committ against another git tree of a 
particular changeset in the middle of one of my trees?
Is there a way to update the comment field of a changeset without 
undoing the whole tree and reapplying each changeset?  This comes up a 
lot when someone opens a bugzilla bug number, after a fix for the 
problem has already been applied to the git tree.  It also would have 
helped once when I wanted to fix the signed-off line which was 
accidently left off without backing the whole set of later changes out 
and reapplying the changeset.
