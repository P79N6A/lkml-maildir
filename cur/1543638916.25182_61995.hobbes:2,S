I'm glad we agree on that one :)
Considering we're not using sockets with broken SIGIO, but pseudo-terminals
like UML instead, there's still a problem:
When the task is registered as socket owner and is just about to enter the
kernel due to a syscall, it will stop with a SIGTRAP and the tracing kernel
process will run sometime and see a SIGCHLD. But after the task stopped and
before the kernel process can change SIGIO ownership back, a new interrupt
could come in and the SIGIO would remain pending in the task's process until
the task was scheduled to run next time.
How do you solve this?
