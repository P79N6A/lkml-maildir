This patch makes me pull faces, sorry.
a) The name "loop_info2" is meaningless.  Something like loop_info64 would
   communicate something to the reader.
b) It is impossible for the reader to tell _why_ loop_info and loop_info2
   exist.  
   It will be especially mysterious in 2.8, where there is no loop_info,
   only a loop_info2.
   Hence covering commentary is compulsory.
c) Could we not save a lot of noise by putting:
	typedef unsigned short legacy_dev_t;	/* <= linux-2.4.x */
   into asm/posix_types.h and then keep all this stuff just in
   <linux/loop.h>?
d) Would it be possible to just add a u64 to the _end_ of the existing
   loop_info and, in the legacy ioctl(), simply massage it?
