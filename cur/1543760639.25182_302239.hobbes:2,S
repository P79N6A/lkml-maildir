I'm not what the impact will be with the vDSO implementation of
gettimeofday which relies on the bits in systemcfg (tb_to_xs etc...).
Currently, the userland code uses the exact same bits as the kernel
code, and thus, we have a garantee of getting the same results from
both. Also, our "special" ppc_adjtimex will also update our offset and
scale factor (with appropriate barriers) in a way that applies to both
the kernel/syscall gettimeofday and the vDSO implementation. I'm not
sure this is still true with your patch.
I suppose I'll have to dig into the details sometime next week..
