Because umpteen years ago when I was adding thread-usage statistics to
/proc/net/rpc/nfsd I used milliseconds and Linus asked me to make it
seconds - a much more "obvious" unit.  See Email below.
It seems very sensible to me.

Maybe it could go in a library :-?

If no programs depend on the format, I actually prefer format changes like
this to be of the "obvious" kind. One such obvious kind is the format
	0.001
which obviously means 0.001 seconds. 
And yes, I'm _really_ sorry that a lot of the old /proc files contain
jiffies. Lazy. Ugly. Bad. Much of it my bad.
Doing 0.001 doesn't mean that you have to use floating point, in fact
you've done most of the work already in your ms patch, just splitting
things out a bit works well:
	/* gcc knows to combine / and % - generate one "divl" */
	unsigned int sec = time / HZ, msec = time % HZ;
	msec = (msec * 1000) / HZ;
	sprintf(" %d.%03d", sec, msec)
(It's basically the same thing you already do, except it doesn't
re-combine the seconds and milliseconds but just prints them out
separately.. And it has the advantage that if you want to change it to
microseconds some day, you can do so very trivially without breaking the
format. Plus it's readable as hell.)
