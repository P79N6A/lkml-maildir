Subject: 2.6.18-mm1: true/false enum in linux/stddef.h fails glibc-2.4 compile

There is an enum contained in some recent -mm versions of
linux/stddef.h which seems to be horking my glibc-2.4 compile:
enum {
        false   = 0,
        true    = 1
};
One way or another (I can't find where), 'true' and 'false' are
getting defined to 1 and 0, turning the above into enum { 0=0, 1=1 },
which though undeniable is not compilable.
This enum shows up in 2.6.18-rc5-mm1 and 2.6.18-mm1, but not in
2.6.17-mm6.
Whether this is the fault of glibc, gcc, or the kernel is a topic I
wouldn't touch with a 3m pole, even if I had one. I've submitted the
issue to the glibc bugzilla as well:
http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3301
Any thoughts would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Eric
