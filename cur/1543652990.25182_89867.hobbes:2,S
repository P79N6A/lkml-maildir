Hello,
Going through different parts of Kernel, I am trying to figure out if I need 
to change /page.h/__PAGE_OFFSET to some smaller value when compiling with 
CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G option to support more than 1G physical memory. Other than 
that, I can not figure out how virtual address for vmalloc and ioremap are 
going to fit above logical addresses.
Any comment appreciated!
Mehdi
