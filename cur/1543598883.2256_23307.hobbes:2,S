The kernel has source control, its name is Linus Torvalds, CVS with a 
brain.
Wether or not the mainstream kernel will ever go pure CVS or the like is 
really up to Linus, and so far I've not seen much indication that he's 
going to do it, at least not before he decides to retire from steering 
the kernel's development.
