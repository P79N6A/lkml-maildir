   Yes, but not as a callback, but instead as an input event. 
Hum. Usually I'm not so dumb, really.
Problem) I need to know when the system goes to sleep in
drivers/input/input.c. For example, as a consequence of 'echo mem
>/sys/power/state'.
Solution 1) My ideal input layer model would be:
               | SUBSYSTEM INPUT DEVICE* |
                   ^  ^      ^       ^
            +------+  |      +----+  +------+ events 
            |         |           |         |
        |KEYBOARD| |MOUSE | |TOUCHSCREEN| |MISC  |
        |DEVICE  | |DEVICE| |DEVICE     | |DEVICE|
               | SUBSYSTEM INPUT DEVICE* |
                   |  |      |       |
            +------+  |      +----+  +------+ suspend()/resume() callbacks
            v         v           v         v
        |KEYBOARD| |MOUSE | |TOUCHSCREEN| |MISC  |
        |DEVICE  | |DEVICE| |DEVICE     | |DEVICE|
Solution 2) On the contrary, you are suggesting to do this:
               |          INPUT DEVICE          |
                   ^     ^      ^           ^
            +------+     |      +----+      +------+ events plus
            |            |           |             | suspend/resume
        |KEYBOARD | |MOUSE    | |TOUCHSCREEN| |MISC      |
        |SUBSYSTEM| |SUBSYSTEM| |SUBSYSTEM  | |SUBSYSTEM |
        |DEVICE*  | |DEVICE*  | |DEVICE*    | |DEVICE*   |
Right?
* or whatever provides suspend/resume callbacks
