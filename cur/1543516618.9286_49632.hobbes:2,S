I've set the machine back to the slowest possible settings and I'm still
getting errors with the memory testing program. 
However, I've just noticed that all the locations in memory where the
errors occurs always ends in '37'. I'm wondering whether these are
significant. The locations seems to be at different places each time, and
sometimes subsequent runs don't show up the errors.

I'm beginning to wonder whether it's the motherboard or the processors
themselves. This machine has never been overclocked or had the bus speed
overclocked.
Cheers,
