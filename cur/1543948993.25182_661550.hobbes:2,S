I'd suggest to move PREEMPT_RCU back to Kconfig.preempt and if you really 
need the second symbol leave this behind (maybe with a comment):
config CLASSIC_RCU
	def_bool !PREEMPT_RCU
Once there are more options, we can still look for a better place...
Also could you please add a proper dependency to RCU_TRACE on PREEMPT_RCU, 
so that this condition isn't needed anymore:
ifeq ($(CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU),y)
obj-$(CONFIG_RCU_TRACE) += rcupreempt_trace.o
endif
Thanks.
bye, Roman
