It is in the modified version. In the long version of my post I wrote
that the maintainer of the driver was so kind to modify the 2.6 driver
code for me, because using such an interface in a bonding configuration
always leads to kernel crashes in 2.4 kernels (I tested 2.4.20 and
2.4.32). Backporting the unmodified 2.6 driver did not change that and
it seems that the crashes are caused by the way the bonding code is
accessing the interface (in combination with the buggy driver, of course).

Thanks for the tip!
I will take a look into the differences between the 2.4 and 2.6 bonding
code and will come back here with questions (that one is for sure!).
Kind regards,
Heiko
