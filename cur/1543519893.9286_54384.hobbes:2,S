OK. So  the  scheduler  has  a  behaviour which  is  complex  enuf  in
different situations. We could nearly endless elaborate them.
As far  as i understand  the scheduler is guided  by a whole  bunch of
constraints which exploit properties of  the system in order to decide
what to do next.
So far  as we observe  the behaviour of  the scheduler there  are some
situations where  context switching is  too expensive compared  to the
remaining  load of  the request,  some  caches are  flushed which  has
negative sideeffects on the overall performance, the cost of switching
can vary on  different hardware. One even could speculate  and try out
stating that switching  one thread back and forth  gets less `usefull'
the more frequently it happens etc.
Brightening things a bit, the remaining questions are: 
  - what are _all_ these constraints
  - how are they balanced against each other
  - does  the  constraint-system  (so  to call)  cover  most  of  the
    interesting  situations, so  that an  optimal scheduling  could be
    found
  - how expensive is it to evaluate the constraints
