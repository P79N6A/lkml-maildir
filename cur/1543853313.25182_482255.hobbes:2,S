Yes, it should be done. But not 100% because x86-64 can use a much more
efficient mapping scheme than i386.
Probably with a mmconfig-common.c. When mmconfig.c was originally written
there wasn't that much support code and the fork wasn't a issue, it just has 
grown over time as we work around more and more bugs.
