Sorry, I know how this happened even.
As an aside, is there a way to make git-am and other stuff using the
git patch applying engine to take patches liberally like 'patch'
would?
The default is extremely strict, which makes me check things out by
hand.  That's good, but as I add the change by hand after verifying
it's sanity I often make mistakes that result in things like the above
missed delete, so if I could ask git to be non-strict it would help me
out a lot.
This doesn't excuse me from looking for bogons at my diffstats of
course :)
