If anything RED will *reduce* oscillations by alleviating retransmit 
synchronization.

See

RED and ECN can be considered independently (although they do work 
together quite well). You can see ECN as a way of the network telling 
the endpoints "Normally I would have dropped this datagram, but I'll 
let you get away with it this time". TCP behavior on reception of an 
ECN should be the same as when a datagram is dropped, but without the 
latency (and jitter) that is the result of a lost datagram.
