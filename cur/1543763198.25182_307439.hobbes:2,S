Yes.

It does seem a bit kludgy. I was trying keep the changes in isofs
specific code, and this seemed the best way to do it.
When you say "all the ->fill_super callers", are you referring to the
fill_super functions for all filesystems? Or just callers to
isofs_fill_super()?
isofs_fill_super() is called by get_sb_bdev(), which is in the generic
filesystem code. get_sb_bdev() receives a pointer as a parameter when it
is called from isofs_get_sb(). To make a change in get_sb_bdev() would
be to affect many (all?) filesystems. This may be the right thing to do
- although it seems a little heavy-weight since the failure hasn't been
reported in other filesystems.
