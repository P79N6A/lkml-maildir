One has to set their way-back machine pretty far back to find the *BSD 
bits which used 0.0.0.0 as the "all nets, all subnets" (to mis-use a 
term) broadcast IPv4 address when sending.  Perhaps as far back as the 
time before HP-UX 7 or SunOS4.  The bit errors in my dimm memory get 
pretty dense that far back...
It has hung-on in various places (stacks) as an "accepted" broadcast IP 
in the receive path, but not the send path for quite possibly decades now.
