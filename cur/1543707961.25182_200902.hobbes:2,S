ok, I tried the patch, you sent, and think what happened?
Everything is working fine now, tested two times, since once in a while 
testgart/C worked at the first attempt...
So, it seems you are right, that the 746FX has the same problem like the 
648...
Thanks for your help!
 Now I can boot directly into X again (juhu!).
Glück Auf
