So why not map the magic page at 0xffffe000 at some other address as
well? 
Static binaries can just directly jump/call into the magic page.
Shared binaries do somekind of mmap("/proc/self/mem") magic to put a
copy of the page at an address that is convenient for them. Shared
binaries have to do a lot of mmap-ing anyway, so the overhead should be
negligible.
