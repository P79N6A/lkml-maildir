But on_each_cpu() does:
        preempt_disable();
        ret = smp_call_function(func, info, retry, wait);
        local_irq_disable();
        func(info);
        local_irq_enable();
        preempt_enable();
I'm confused. I really don't need to swap the instruction on each cpu. I really
need to make sure each cpu is not fetching that instruction while I change it.
s390 doesn't have a flush_icache_range() (which the other arches use after the 
swap). I thought that the synchronization that smp_call_function() does was the
primary reason for using it here, not repeatedly changing the same area of 
memory.  If you'd prefer I use on_each_cpu() instead of smp_call_function(), 
no problem.  
Thanks
Mike
