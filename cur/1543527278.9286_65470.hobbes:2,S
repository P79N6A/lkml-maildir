A while ago, there was this site with links to sites with
patches that fix bugs, patches for new functionality, new 
drivers, etc. But that one seems to be dead now.
Is there any other site keeping links to these kind of sites?
I found that there are too many usefull things (like mergemem
and this checkpointing tool) which are in no searchengine at
all which is a shame.
