There are no patches to iproute2 required to get it to compile against 
2.6 headers; the only patch required was to linux/netdevice.h, which 
has been included in 2.6.0-test6.
However, it would be wonderful if someone knowledgeable could take 
over maintainership of iproute2 if Alexey can no longer do it. It's in 
a sorry state at the moment, and most distros ship significantly 
patched versions.
