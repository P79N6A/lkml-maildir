Hello again,
Sorry for a long delay with my reply.

There's no entry in MAINTAINERS list, but I assume it's Jens Axboe as he's
in the copyright section in scatterlist.c.

The really useful one here is cb710_modify_port_*(), read/write are for
consistency. I'd prefer to keep those wrappers because they help to eliminate
some noise from register access logic in the driver.

I thought this as the easiest way to assure that on return from
cb710_set_irq_handler() there's no interrupt handler running using the
old slot->irq_handler value.

This is mostly related to veryfying some assumptions on the MMC core
infrastructure. I can remove this altogether if the calls to driver
->request() and ->set_ios() are really guaranteed to be serialized.

Hmm. I checked couple random drivers in kernel tree and none (including
MMC host drivers) are touching interrupt allocation in suspend/resume.

Will turn this into pure comment - just to remember.

That's what the original driver advertises. I can't verify the exact
voltage that is supplied to the card, so I'll assume that's 3.3V and
remove MMC_VDD_34_35 as you suggest.

Will try.
