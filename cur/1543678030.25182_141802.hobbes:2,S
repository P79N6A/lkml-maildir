Subject: [patch] setscheduler fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here is my patch. It is the same idea as Joe's. Is there a better fix?
Basically, the problem is that setscheduler() does not set need_resched
when needed. There are two basic cases where this is needed:
	- the task is running, but now it is no longer the highest
	  priority task on the rq
	- the task is not running, but now it is the highest
	  priority task on the rq
In either case, we need to set need_resched to invoke the scheduler.
Patch is against 2.5.72. Comments?

setschedule() needs to force a reschedule in some situations.
