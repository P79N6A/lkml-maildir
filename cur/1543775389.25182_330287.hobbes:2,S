Curious to wait until 2.6.13 pops up to see how much people will end up
having non working systems either because :
	1) They removed entries in their /dev
	2) Did not maintain their /dev for years because anyway it was not
directly accessed
	3) modified their /etc/fstab to put devfs names rather than FHS/LSB
compliant names...
	4) other weird /dev-devfs interaction I cannot imagine yet
BTW speaking of initramfs to hold the minimal /dev, in the embedded
world initramfs has to be stored in flash as udev binary and eventually
additionnal scripts, this represent flash memory (OK very little I have
to admit but when you need to find 10K of flash or change the flash
size...).
I hope someone will pick-up your nano defvs proposal and enhance it to
support a  version enabling to boot a system without anything in /dev.
Unfortunately no time yet on my side.
Thanks for all the things you have done in linux,
