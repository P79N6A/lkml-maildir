No, it's not allright. Modprobe can't distinguish between
sym53c8xx_2/sym53c8xx.o and sym53c8xx.o, you have to figure out the
full path and insmod one of them manually. Xose is right in that
sym53c8xx_2/sym53c8xx.o should be renamed in sym53c8xx_2/sym53c8xx_2.o.
Compare with aic7xxx and aic7xxx_old.
