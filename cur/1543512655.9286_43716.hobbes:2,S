Nope.  We spent a fair amount of effort on this with the page cache
changes.  The ext2 truncate code is really, really careful to provide
bforget() with the correct conditions to get rid of the buffer: it is a
closely designed interaction between delete and bforget.  Remember, we
have exactly the same potential problems when freeing dirty indirect
blocks as we have when freeing directory blocks.
There's a big comment near the top of fs/ext2/truncate.c about the way
in which this works.

Ouch --- that pays the penalty for normal data blocks every time you
pull them into cache.  No way.
The correct way to extend the current rules cleanly is to make the
truncate code do a bforget() on data blocks as well as indirect blocks
if, and only if, the file is not a regular file.  That will deal with
the symlink case too, and will mean that we are using the same mechanism
for all of our dynamically-allocatable metadata.
