Hi All,
Is it possible to change the normal kernel execution path using a
loadable module, without actually patching the kernel?
e.g
    fun1()->fun2()->fun3()->fun4()->fun5()->fun6()
Can i change this method invocation sequence to a custom sequence
using *only* loadable modules?
i.e
   fun1()->fun2()-->myfun1()-->myfun2()....->fun4()->fun5()->fun6().
And i do not want to replace any in kernel methods with my custom hooks.
Tried asking on kernelnewbies but i am not satisfied with the
debuggers pointed as help(i.e kprobes).
Apologies if this is too trivial for you all.
Any help?
Thanks
