That's what lots of people thought who are now sitting on their OSes, 
wondering why the number of users shrinks and shrinks and shrinks...
It's IMHO not a really good idea to drop support for decent hardware, 
especially if the hardware itself might work better than the replacement 
which keeps up the supported standard.
