Subject: 2.4.0 test13-pre7 still causes CDROM ioctl errors

I had sent the following report a week ago:
--------------------------
Since I've installed 2.4.0 test13-pre4, I see the following errors
in my log:
	sr0: CDROM (ioctl) reports ILLEGAL REQUEST.
and xmcd reports:
	CD audio: ioctl error on /dev/scd0: cmd=CDROMVOLCTRL errno=95
This was working fine with 2.4.0 test12-pre5, which was the previous
kernel I was using.
-------------------------
Well, I installed 2.4.0 test13-pre7 and I still have the same error.
My CDROM driver is SCSI, connected to a Tekram DC390.  I use
the am53c974 driver.
Something must have changed in this driver since 2.4.0 test12-pre5 which
broke the ioctl() handling routine.
