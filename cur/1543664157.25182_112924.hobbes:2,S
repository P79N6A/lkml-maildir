Subject: [PATCH] Use hex numbers in fs/block_dev.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

We're using hex numbers to identify devices in most places. We should use
them in filesystem messages, errors etc. too, this would be much more
consistent and avoids things like this where two different naming styles
for the same error are used:
     end_request: [...] dev 16:45 (hdd), sector 9175248
     EXT3-fs error (device ide1(22,69)): [...] inode=575269, block=1146906
With this patch the second message would look like this:
     EXT3-fs error (device ide1(16:45)): [...] inode=575269, block=1146906
This code is used in some drivers outside fs/ too, but there only in *print*
or DEBUG's.
