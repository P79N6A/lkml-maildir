Although I haven't looked into the Crusoe processor support, it may be 
that there is a different set of power parameters, not cpu speed 
directly, that are appropriate to manage on these platforms (after a 
brief look, seems to be a range of frequencies and some sort of flags)? 
  If so, these sorts of machine-specific power parameters are what 
PowerOP is trying to address, allowing management of the underlying 
machine-specific stuff to upper layers that may be presenting an 
abstracted view of power/performance, such as CPU speed or speed ranges, 
to the user.  Thanks,
