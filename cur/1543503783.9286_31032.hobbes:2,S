Since FIRST error message come from bash and NOT from test command it does not
look like problem with test command.

Since problem with fork/exec happens EXTREMALLY rare. I seen such problems
myself few times with real programs like login/pppd under 2.2 (when 2.0 works
flawlessly) but was unable to trigger it in controlled environment :-((

There are something fishy in fork and/or exec in 2.2. Test was created to
trigger such problem (unsuccessfull for me, unfortunatelly). When you
"optimized" it with removal of fork/exec apparently out with the bathwater
went the baby (i.e. fork/exec in this case)...

Original poster said that BSD proccess accounting will help trigger the
problem but login was unable to execute pppd on perfectly idle system
without BSD process accounting :-(( It's sad that there are no way to
reproduce problem in controlled environment...
