I have just installed RedHat Linux 6.0 on IBM netfinity 5000 Server. I did a server class
installation.
I want some help to do the following :-
1. How to configure the SMP as I am using two Intel Pentium III Processors?
2. Is there a way to resize the partitions while running/using the Linux OS?
3. Any tips on how best to do partitioning on this machine that has 18.2 GB hard Drive, 384MB RAM
when doing Custom                    class installation
Really appreciate any kind of tips and leads to this matter.
Thanks in advance.
