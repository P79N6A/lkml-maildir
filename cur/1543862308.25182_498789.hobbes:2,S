Subject: [patch 0/10] buffered write deadlock fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The following set of patches attempt to fix the buffered write
locking problems (and there are a couple of peripheral patches
and cleanups there too).
This does pass the write deadlock tests that otherwise fail.
Has survived a few hours of fsx-linux on ext2 and 3.
Patches against 2.6.20-rc4. I didn't have the heart to attempt
to rebase them on -mm, at least until I get some feedback ;)
Thanks,
Nick
