 Similar on a NoName. I turned 'vendor options' off as somebody suggested
now, instead of Opps and instant death, 'insmod sr_mod' hangs. Unkillable.
Have to reboot to get rid of the ismod process.
 The module starts to initalise, it managed to report to the console that
I have a CDROM drive on SCSI ID 5 before hanging.
 I am using gcc 2.7.2.1
