NPTL doesn't support _POSIX_MESSAGE_PASSING yet, because the
kernel doesn't support it yet (patches are floating around though
and as soon as kernel starts supporting NPTL will add support
for it).

#include <unistd.h> and check the various _POSIX_* macros
(or browse /usr/include/{,nptl/}bits/posix_opt.h) or use sysconf/getconf
(for mq_* sysconf (_SC_MESSAGE_PASSING) or getconf MESSAGE_PASSING).  See
