	I forgot to mention one thing in my the message that I sent
a minute ago: I understand that the cmd640_vlb kernel command line
argument needs to be settable via a module parameters for cmd640 to
be fully functional as a kernel module.  I will take care of that
if making cmd640 a module would work in the scenario that I described
(userland is careful not to set 32-bit IO or IRQ unmasking until the
cmd640 module can be loaded).
