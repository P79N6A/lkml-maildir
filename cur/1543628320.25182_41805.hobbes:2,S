Can you be convinced to post a sample trigger doing this?
Not only will that show people an example of emailing from a trigger,
but more importantly it will expose any wonky details of the bkbits.net
email system that need to be accounted for...  Does standard pipe to
/usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i work as expected, for example?
