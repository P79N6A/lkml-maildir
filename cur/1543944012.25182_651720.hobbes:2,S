Yeah, I know.  The problem is that each patch must compile and run.  They
can't be split up without violating that unfortunately.

Fair point.  Fixed.

The problem is that there can't be one with this patch as the task_security
struct and the LSM security data attached to it may outlive the task it points
back to.
It seems that the backpointer can be dispensed with.  Nothing particularly
seems to use it.  Do you know the reason for its existence?
