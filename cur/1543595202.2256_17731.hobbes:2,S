first of all, if you are not interested in compiler comparision, just
skip.
I though posting a little demonstration of how well performing code gcc
2.95.2 generates (vs. gcc 3.0) won't hurt. Also shown, that further
optimatizations are anything but impossible (using Intel's commercial c
compiler).
I know opendivx code is not like kernel code at all, but on the other hand
it is well suited for benchmark testing.
Maybe this will cool down thoose a bit, who were to move to gcc 3.0 as
fast as possible, for the _way_ better generated code...

Hi,
Just compiled and try gcc 3.0 stable.
And the results is very big surprise! It makes *SLOWER* code!
test file:  (opendivx with postprocessing, this stuff is written in C)
# mplayer -osdlevel 0 -nosound -benchmark 1800.avi -vo null -pp 15
VIDEO:  [divx]  640x352  24bpp  23.98 fps  1865.1 kbps (227.7 kbyte/s)
hardware: celeron-2 600 @ 900MHz (100MHz FSB), 256MB RAM (PC133, at 2/2/2)
(sse,mmx,mmxext enabled)
gcc 2.95.2 result:  (flags: -O4 -march=i686 -mcpu=i686 -pipe -ffast-math)
BENCHMARKs: V:   5.087s VO:   0.001s A:   0.000s Sys:   0.013s =    5.101s
BENCHMARK%: V: 99.7160% VO:  0.0258% A:  0.0000% Sys:  0.2582% = 100.0000%
gcc 3.0 result:  (flags: -O4 -march=i686 -mcpu=i686 -pipe -ffast-math)
BENCHMARKs: V:   5.194s VO:   0.001s A:   0.000s Sys:   0.013s =    5.208s
BENCHMARK%: V: 99.7309% VO:  0.0221% A:  0.0000% Sys:  0.2471% = 100.0000%
yes, speed diff isn't big, but i was prepared for big speed boost by 3.0,
and then i got speed loss! :(
if i recompile C-only parts of decore with intel's commercial C compiler
(free beta available for linux), it's about 15% faster:
icc result:  (optim. flags: -O2 -fp -rcd -tpp6 -xiMK)
BENCHMARKs: V:   4.415s VO:   0.001s A:   0.000s Sys:   0.013s =    4.429s
BENCHMARK%: V: 99.6676% VO:  0.0290% A:  0.0000% Sys:  0.3034% = 100.0000%
