what noise? If someone really wants networking discussions only, use 
this procmail rule:
  :0 HBc
          * .*net: *
          sched-patches
to separate it into an extra folder and use "net: " as an agreed upon 
Subject line if you really want to narrow things down. (But there would 
still be all the other mail just in case the developer has to look at 
the wider picture. There would be no "I'm only subscribed to netdev" 
excuse. )
but there should still be one central repository for all kernel 
discussions - just like there is one central repository for all kernel 
code.

i think that's the problem. Developers (and here i dont mean you) who
want to do "development only", without being exposed to the global state
of the kernel and without being exposed to bugs. I think that's the
basic mindset difference. That is one of the factor that is causing
assymetric allocation of developers and the increasing detachment from
reality.

that "crap" that i'd like to see dumped upon lkml would be netdev 
traffic mainly - most of the other kernel development lists (and i'm 
subscribed to many of them) are low-traffic. netdev is the main reason 
why we cannot do a "one common discussion forum" approach.
