What does not work?  Does the driver load?  Can you ping?  Does the 
driver work for a little while then stop?  Does it work perfectly except 
under heavy load?
Also, please read "REPORTING-BUGS" file in a Linux kernel source tree 
for additional debugging information to provide (lspci, dmesg, etc.)
Your patch includes so much junk it is obviously unacceptable. 
Therefore, I request that you work with me (and other kernel developers) 
to narrow down the problem, so that it may be fixed.
Regards,
	Jeff
