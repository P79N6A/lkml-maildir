Yes.  In theory, dma_alloc_coherent() and dma_mmap_coherent() should
cover all the magic each arch requires.

Well, the whole page-reserve kludge should disappear anyway in near
future.  Right now it's in the process.
The memory allocation stuff in ALSA is being largely rewritten on my
local tree, but it's not released yet.  One reason is to wait for the
finish of page-reserve removals, and another reason is that I've had
little time to tidy them up :)
