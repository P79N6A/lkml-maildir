Subject: [patch 0/4] Instrumentation menu removal, against 2.6.24-rc4-mm1 (mmotm)

Hi Andrew,
This time I am taking no chance :
The instrumentation menu removal patchset here applies against 2.6.24-rc4-mm1
_and_ against mmotm (dated : stamp-2007-12-05-15-24) without problem.
We should hopefully be able to stop racing against other architecture specific
fixes done underneath. Please be aware that the following fix :
- fix-oprofile-configuration-breakage.patch
from MIPS did not show up in your mmotm tree. I guess you just sent it upstream
without keeping it in your own tree. I have applied the content of this fix in
my patchset (meaning : select HAVE_OPROFILE if !MIPS_MT_SMTC in
add-have-oprofile.patch), but I think you might have a reject if you still have
this fix-oprofile-configuration-breakage.patch in your local tree but not in
mmotm.
Mathieu
