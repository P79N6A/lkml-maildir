I believe we are seeing similar behaviours with the drivers. As a
temporary workaround, we have asked the manufacturers to supply us
with a BIOS that disabled THRM-Throttling. So far, things are looking
good, but we are still doing more testing.

In our case, we are running the unit in mobile environment, with not
much ventilation. In our test environment, the unit runs fine at
temperatures of 80-90 degrees. In the real environment, we only expect
temperatures of 50-70 degrees.
