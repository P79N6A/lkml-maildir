Hm.  I haven't touched Valgrind in a couple of years, and I suspect 
people haven't been as mean to it as I was being.  It might be time I 
gave it some love.  (I've also been thinking about porting it to be a 
Xen guest so that we can Valgrind whole virtual machines - but that's a 
different story.)
