  The need for changes in allocation mechanism was the reason why I have
limited the buffer increase to 640 bytes. If changes already exist, and
there is no some hidden overhead associated with them, I am all for it.
  Still it's not a replacement for the change in serial driver that I have
posted -- assumption that hardware is slower than we are, that it has
limited buffer in the way, and that it's ok to discard all the data beyond
our buffer's size is, to say least, silly.
