And if BEST had ever made a better qaulity product than APC, I would have
done BEST a the favor.  Since APC has always made the superior product
and have scalable devices and native hotswap, do you go with second place
(or the first loser) or a winner?  Yes, it was a nightmare of the worst
kind.  Linux/opensource won another fight, thus I owe RMS and GNU a debt
of graditude.  Mike Harris wins the door prize for kicking a sleeping
TIGER, `SQUARE IN THE "BALLS"!!!!' with both feet.  Thus the former came
to my aid/council to weave through the mine field; mean while, I lob the
"FAT MAN" (1940's) based on a document web search to CMA and CYA.
For the record, I never had any internal docs/specs on their product line.
They were amazed that any idoit would lob characters at the device and see
what happens.  They new it what theoritcally possible to create "apcupsd",
but never thought is was possible.  Did someone say Linux in '92 and where
are we today.  I did it more so to prove them wrong, and encourage them to
the opensource community.  They almost jumped with opensource with the
USB-UPS protocol, I hinted for the API for USB to port into Linux and it
almost happened............another day.
We one the point of clean room design, but the price was that I had to
ship the package to Denmark to require international law to be invoked.
Get the point, so go easy on APC.......I still have high level access and
open discussions to continue a convincing dialog on the merits of
opensourse.

Again, for the record, I never had any internal docs/specs on their products.

Duh, have you ever tried to read and understand "three card monty"
design of "CheckUPS II".  It is as bad as the canned packages that create
the miniport interface for M$'s API.

Company or Hardware?
Something born of OpenSource fighting to live?
	or
Three Card Monty, that claims to be a token gift.
Now for the final note::
They have one or two guys.......
	or
All of opensource and many of the finest minds in computing to day!!!
