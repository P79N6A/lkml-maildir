So s/gcc/$(SOME_MAKEFILE_VARIABLE)/g  I was simplifying for the sake  
of suggestion/example; adding in support for all of those is  
nontrivial and best left to those who thoroughly understand the  
kernel Makefile system (IE: Not me :-D).

Why not?  Some of that stuff may get used in kernel headers, which  
sparse should definitely have defined.  Besides, sparse is designed  
to check C source code, which will be compiled with said GCC using  
those preprocessing defines.  Why should it use a different set of  
defines?

We do far worse messes in per-arch Makefiles, and this seems  
reasonably easy to put in an arch-generic makefile, unless there is  
some significant complication you didn't mention.

I have yet to see any problem, however complicated, which, when you  
looked at it in the right way, did not become still more complicated.
