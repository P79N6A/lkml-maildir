If they have this, why don't they show the evidence? It has been more than
a year and a half, and no shred of anything even remotely resembling
evidence has shown up. To me, this says clearly that there is none (I for
one would not go around spending a few millions of dollars a month just for
fun, if I could stop the bleeding by just showing what I will have to show
anyway later on).

That is for sure. But they have nothing more than that confidence.

Look closer.

That is complete madness.

Right. SMP, NUMA, filesystems are "low impact".

If you don't use them, that is.

Linux (Linus et al) has done more than a good-faith effort to remove any
infringing code: They have repeatedly asked for details on what is
illegally in the kernel (and why), to remove it ASAP. No answer worthy of
that name. Likewise, the kernel code has been compared to SysV and other
variants (by people with access to the relevant sources), and nothing fishy
has shown up to here AFAIK.

AFAIU, RCU is patented (now IBM holds it). It is certainly not in the
public domain.

Better just dump it all. Or start off a *BSD variant, where there is _no_
SCOX complications, and no need to shell out a few hundred millions to get
the relevant rights (yes, that is what they are worth; the 50K offer is
completely ridiculous). Note that just a few people declining your offer
makes it moot, and I know for a fact that many here on LKML will pass such
an offer.
Why don't you go trolling elsewhere?
