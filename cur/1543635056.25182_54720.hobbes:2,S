This is unacceptable; if my problem is really fixable by a firmware
upgrade IBM should have pushed this very upgrade publically after they
started to learn about the problem. Saying "Hey, BTW: if you had this
firmware version you would never have experienced your data loss" is
a very strong argument to never buy any IBM hardware again.
Still, the techsupport insisted on a software problem and didn't mention
a firmware upgrade; up to now I didn't even knew such a thing exists.
And letting customers lowlevel-format a drive, restore their data,
and experience the same problem again a week later is anything but
professional.
Though the timespan makes me curious: Why is there a magnitude
difference in runtime between the first problem on a fresh drive
and after a lowlevel format?
