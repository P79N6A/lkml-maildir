Netapp optionally made .snapshot not show up in readdir, which solved
that problem.
I have a bigger issue with it starting with only one dot, which is
traditionally used for user configuration information.  I think
..snapshot would have been a better choice, and by extension leaving
double-dot filenames as filesystem namespace (I know that contradicts
POSIX, but the only namespace available in POSIX is /../ which is a
global namespace.)
