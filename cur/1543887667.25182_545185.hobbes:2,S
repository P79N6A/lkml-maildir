Not sure.  I ran a benchmark before adding compression support in QEMU
with a lightning-fast device.  So the results should differ quite a bit
from practice.

LogFS was actually faster than JFFS2.  So for that particular
unrealistic benchmark, updating the LogFS tree was less expensive than
trying (and failing) to compress and calculating the CRC was for JFFS2.
With compression finished, I would expect LogFS numbers to degrade.  If
file data had checksums (not done yet, should be optional for users to
decide) even more so.

LogFS isn't that good yet.  Right now, writing 10 adjacent blocks to a
file requires 10 tree updates instead of 1.  Not full updates though,
just up to the inode.
Quite surprisingly, read speed in the benchmark was significantly better
for LogFS, even after substracting mount time.  I don't know if all of
that can be explained with CRC checks or there is more to it.
