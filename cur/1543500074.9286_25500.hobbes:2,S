Ingo,
I've reviewed the code sections you are refering to.  This is along the same
lines to what Windows NT is doing, but not identical.  From what I've seen,
this could really help Linux.  The next step would be to create file runs
for SMP read/write.  The I/O model of NT allows these runs to be transacted
in parallel with the I/O subsystem for SMP and "remembers" them.  For a good
idea about what NT is looking for, check out NWFILE.C in our code base at
207.109.151.240.    There is a function called TrgLookupFileAllocation in
the NT specific section.  By way of example, Linux uses the NWReadFile
function while Windows NT uses the TrgLookupFileAllocation function.  MS
actually stores the file allocations in the VM Cache, and then transacts
them by completely bypassing the file system driver.  In essence, the file
system driver is reduced to simply being an on-disk decode agent for the VM
Cache Manager.  In the Windows NT Fenris, only certain requests ever make it
into an IORP request.  Files are read and written directly by the VM Cache
Manager and the File System driver only maintains meta-data fior the file
system (FAT's, Dirs, etc.).  This is how NTFS, FASTFAT, CDFS, and FENRIS are
all structured on Windows NT.  WARNING!!!! There are some very complex
unwind cases associated with the methods used by MS in their file systems.
On SMP, however, their model is unequalled from structly a parallelism
standpoint.
The next step is to build something like MCB lists that will allow your file
cache to bypass the file system drivers.  There are some complex concurrency
issues here.  NT deals with them, in rather complex ways (the MCB lists in
essence become the file allocation storage method rather than the
proprietary methods each file system driver uses).  The advantages here are
intutitive.  having the file systems architected this way allows pretty
incredible parallelism on SMP because multiple requesters can have their
requests transacted in parallel by the cache manager because it KNOWS ALL
THE FILE RUN INFO THE EACH DEVICE'S FILES WTHOUT NEEDING TO KNOW OR CARE
ABOUT HOW EACH FILE SYSTEM STORES META DATA FOR A FILE.
What would really make this easy to understand from a Linux standpoint were
if I open sourced the Windows NT portions of FENRIS that were removed so you
could see the differences between FENRIS NT and FENRIS Linux.  I will ask MS
if they have no objections (MS worked with us on this, and they have some
ownership rights of the Windows NT portions of FENRIS not released).  I do
not think they would object, but I will ask.  I think FENRIS is probably
oneof the first file systems that has been single-sourced between NT and
Linux.
Jeff
