Hopefully it's for a different reason than that, as deriving a clock
from the PCI bus is an explicit violation of the bus spec.  (think about
what happens when you underclock the bus, which is quite legal; changing
the clock in midstream and other things hostile to PLLs are also legal, 
I believe.)
My own two cents on the issue - I've got an old socket 7 motherboard that
overclocks the PCI bus for higher FSB speeds, and the first time I did
that it ate my tulip card.  That'll teach me...
