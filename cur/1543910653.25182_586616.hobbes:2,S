trusting the bios to be accurate for all machines is generally a ...
well... it's like trusting politicians in election week.
But it's sort of the best we got; at the same time, what are the odds
that the time is more than an order of magnitude off? if the latency of
the cpu is so large that the requirement ehci puts in is orders of
magnitude more strict, a bit inaccurate data from the bios doesn't
matter all that much. And worst case we make a table with quirks somehow
(probably on cpu vendor/model I suppose)
