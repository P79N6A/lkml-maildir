I've thought some more, and yes someone else has already done this.  Problems
are with compilers that
put code on stack (g++ trampolines for local functions i think).  There is
the gcc-mod (Stack-guard?) that checks for
corrupt stack frame using magic number containing zeros before returning...
this will take away some
performance though...
I wonder if the root of the issue is the underlying security architechure ...
anything that needs ANY privilege
gets ALL privileges (ie root).  chown named and such fixes this, but can't
rebind to privileged port, must be restarted
by root to do so.  VMS / NT have more fine grained privileges.
Is there any documentation of the kernel's 'capabilities' functions?  It
would be exceedingly cool if services (named, nfs, etc)
could be updated to use this;  I think crackers would loose some motivation
if instead of "hey I can totally rule this box!"
they have to settle for "hey I can make the ident service report user 'CrAp'
for every port!".
