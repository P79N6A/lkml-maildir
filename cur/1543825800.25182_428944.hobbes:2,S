Hi,
  I have a driver full of printks. i am trying to understand the way
the driver functions using printks
  So, i have a situation where i want all the printk's to be printed
come whatever.
   I dont want any rate limiting or anything else that prevents from
my printks from appearing on the screen or dmesg.
 Its really confusing when only one of your printks appear and some
just dont appear even though you expect them to appear.
  Is there any way to make all the printks to appear come what may?.
If so, how do  i do it?.
  Went through the printk.c am not sure setting the
printk_ratelimit_jiffies = 0 and printk_ratelimit_burst= 1000 will do?
  am not sure if printk_ratelimit_jiffies = 0 is valid.
please advice.
Regards,
sriram
