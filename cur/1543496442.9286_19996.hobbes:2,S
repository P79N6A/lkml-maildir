I am running 2.2.7 SMP on a dual PII-450, and I "regularly" get total
lockups. It happens to me just after a recompile of a large
application (17MB including debugging info), at the point where I tell
gdb to restart it. It happens approximately once in every 20-30
restarts, but I also have a feeling that it occurs more often as the
machine has been up longer.
I have been unclear whether it is X related (since, like alex, i can't
test network accessibility) or the kernel dying.
Its certainly consistent with a file system issue; right now, I have 3
"syncs" at the end of my makefile, and its always notable that the
first of these shuffles a lot of blocks onto the disk (not
suprisingly, having just compiled a 17MB executable).
