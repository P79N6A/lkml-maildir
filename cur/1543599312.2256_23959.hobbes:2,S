Right. The feature fixup was originally intended for altivec-specific
cruft in arch/ppc/kernel/*.S, and was only later extended to a few
more things like get_cycles(). It doesn't handle modules, and that
can ideed be an issue. 
I'm looking forward to your modutils. The kernel's do_cpu_ftr_fixups
function has to be modified to take the pointer & size of the fixup
section so that it can be called for modules as well.
Ben.
