That would be nice. Fixing it so that it actually works (_if_ it does not)
can still be done later.
Btw. you have
/*
 * Stop the automatic memory scanning thread. This function must be called
 * with the kmemleak_mutex held.
 */
void stop_scan_thread(void)
{
...
but call the function unlocked from kmemleak_write. Looks like a bug ;)
