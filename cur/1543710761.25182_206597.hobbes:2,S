Ben, can you work this out?  I can make it compile by just making the
_for_cpu and _for_device routines behave identically to what the
consisten_sync{,_page}() stuff does now.  But I'd much rather a ppc32
person implement it correctly and optimally.
In short, the _for_device routines should make sure cacheable data in
the cpu is fully visible to the DMA device, and _for_cpu should make
sure all device DMA is visible to the processor.
