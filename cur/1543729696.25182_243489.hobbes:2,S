This is a community of _volunteers_, if you want your particular itch

I've been on this list for quite some time, and this is the very first time
I hear anything about such a thing. Care to elaborate?
[Yes, there are people who are almost universally on killfiles of the lead
 hackers, but that is their own fault... and the list managers don't need
 to bann anybody that way ;-]

Proof, please.

If you want that fixed so you can make money off Linux, you'd better well
pay for the privilege of having your particular desires taken care of.
Probably off this list, as kernel debuggers in general are persona non
grata here, commercial software meddling with the inards of the kernel even
less wellcome.

This is probably just working to get the most out of the kernel, and the
constraint of "making kernel debuggers easy to write" just isn't in the
requirements. The kernel hackers (rightly so, IMVHO) reserve the right to
change interfases at the drop of a hat. If third parties get burned, just
too bad.
