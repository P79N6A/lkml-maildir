I reverted the patch from before since it didn't seem to help. Do you
think it may have to do with my system having Hyper-Threading enabled?
I should have pointed out before that I don't really have a dual-core
system, just a P4 with Hyper-Threading (I loosely used core to refer
to processor).
Some new numbers for 2.6.23-rc6-cfs-devel (!CONFIG_PREEMPT and bound
to single processor)
lat_ctx:
15  2.73
16  2.74
17  2.81
18  2.74
19  2.74
20  2.73
21  2.60
22  2.74
23  2.72
24  2.74
25  2.74
hackbench:
80 11.578
81 11.991
82 11.914
83 12.026
84 12.226
85 12.347
86 12.552
87 12.655
88 13.011
89 12.941
90 13.237
pipe-test:
1  9.58
2  9.58
3  9.58
4  9.58
5  9.58
6  9.58
7  9.58
8  9.58
9  9.58
10 9.58
The obligatory graphs:

A cursory glance suggests that performance wrt lat_ctx and hackbench
has increased (lower numbers), but degraded quite a lot for pipe-test.
The numbers for  pipe-test are extremely stable though, while the
numbers for hackbench are more erratic (which isn't saying much since
the original numbers gave nearly a straight line). I'm still willing
to try out any more ideas.

Rob
