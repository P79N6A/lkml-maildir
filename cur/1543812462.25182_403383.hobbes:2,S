The effect is that the first call to do_timer doesn't increment xtime.
This explains why the code I have to detect disagreements between
xtime and the time of day as computed from the timebase register was
finding a disagreement on the first tick, which I was scratching my
head over.
There may be other effects on architectures which use wall_jiffies to
detect lost timer ticks.  We don't have that problem on PPC and we
don't use wall_jiffies in computing time of day.
Paul.
