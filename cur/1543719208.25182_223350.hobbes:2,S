Change OK once cleanups are moved to separate patch.

OK

Change OK, patch rejected due to Lindent (!!!) being included in this 
patch as well as functional changes.

OK
> [PATCH 5/14 linux-2.6.7-rc1] prism54: new prism54 kernel compatibility
rejected, see Arjan's comments
also, prismcompat24.h doesn't belong in the 2.6 kernel.
> [PATCH 6/14 linux-2.6.7-rc1] prism54: Fix prism54.org bugs 74, 75
OK
> [PATCH 7/14 linux-2.6.7-rc1] prism54: Fix 2.4 build
rejected, as per comment for patch #5

cleanups and bug fixes mixed together in same patch.
Change OK once cleanups are moved to separate patch.
> [PATCH 9/14 linux-2.6.7-rc1] prism54: Fix prism54.org bug 77; strengthened oid transaction
More functional changes mixed in with whitespace and formatting cleanups.
Change OK once cleanups are moved to separate patch.
> [PATCH 10/14 linux-2.6.7-rc1] prism54: Don't allow mib reads while unconfigured
Change OK once cleanups are moved to separate patch.
> [PATCH 11/14 linux-2.6.7-rc1] prism54: Touched up kernel compatibility
Rejected due to patch #5 comments.
> [PATCH 12/14 linux-2.6.7-rc1] prism54: Start using likely/unlikely
Use of likely()/unlikely() is OK.
A change to skb_reserve() was snuck into this patch, completely 
unrelated to $subject.  Also, meaningless cleanups obscure things here too.
> [PATCH 13/14 linux-2.6.7-rc1] prism54: Fix 2.4 SMP build
I agree with this change, but this patch also includes unrelated changes!!
> [PATCH 14/14 linux-2.6.7-rc1] prism54: Fix channel stats; bump to 1.2
OK
Summary:  I'm glad you broke up the changes into multiple patches. 
Thank you.  However, the patches were separated in non-sensical ways. 
Follow these guidelines:
1) With this many patches, cosmetic changes (whitespace, formatting, 
Lindent) should be in separate patches from functional changes.
2) Fully describe all the changes in the patch.  If a patch says "fix 
2.4 SMP build", it should do that and nothing else.
3) Kernel compatibility is achieved by coding for the latest kernel 
(2.6.x), and then creating back-compat definitions that make the 2.6.x 
API (as it's used in your driver) work under earlier kernels.  This is 
known as the "kcompat" approach.  See the kcompat toolkit at 
http://sf.net/projects/gkernel/
 for examples.
Please resend the patch series with the changes requested.  It is OK if 
you lump Lindent/whitespace/formatting changes into one big patch, if 
you wish -- assuming that patch contains nothing else.
	Jeff
