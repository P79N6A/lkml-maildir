I recompiled all kernels from 2.6.11 to 2.6.16 with the
ATA_FLAG_SATA_RESET and was able to boot up to 2.6.12.  2.6.13 would
hang mounting ext3. This is bad news though, a sata_nv.c diff between
2.6.12 and 2.6.13 shows no changes. Which I guess it means there's
nothing wrong with sata_nv.c.
I would understand now that the ATA_FLAG_SATA_RESET introduced in
2.6.10 just highlighted another bug somewhere else which affects
my machine, and I would need to look at other changes between 2.6.9
and 2.6.10. What should I do now?
Another thing I have discovered is that if I boot with a Knoppix
5 (kernel 2.6.17 I believe) and mount the sata drives read only,
there is no problem with them. I can read their whole contents,
really fast, without hiccups. It's at the point of using fdisk on
them or trying to mount them as writeable that the commands hang.
