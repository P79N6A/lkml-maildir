Head of Operations.
Dear Friend,
With much sincerity of purpose I make this contact with you in this divine year
of 2006 as I strongly believed in spiritual expect life that control the
physical and the divine nature that governs the universe.
My name is Mr.  Mark Johnson an accountant in a reputable bank in Benin Republic
West Coast Africa.I am contacting you with the hope of having a private and
confidential business with you. I am writing you asking for your assistance in
the transfer of USD.10.8M (Ten Million, Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars).
Before I go ahead with my request I will like to inform you that I loved if we
could meet to discuss this transaction in person due to its magnitude, I am
taking this urgent move in order to make an acquaintance with you prior to the
time I will be due for an official assignment in Europe But first I will like
to put in the light of this transaction.
Close to the end of 2001 my bank decided to take a major step by changing the
policy of all its branches due to the merger with another bank. Hence due to
the change in policies and top management it became necessary for some majors
customers to determine their positions with the bank.
Due to the large amount involved, some of the foreign customer who believed that
the new policy would not benefit them found it hard to transfer their funds as
result of procedures involved and limited time.
A foreign customer Mr.David Johnson a national of your country approached me in
confidence and asked for my assistance in the transfer of his funds, which I
agreed to. I offered my assistance in the little way I could and I gave him
some recommendation. Apparently the fund was moved from my bank shortly after
this time.
To my surprise I did not hear from him afterwards, which really was not what I
expected, to more of my surprise I was contacted by the financial institution I
recommended him to late last year that he has not come to finalize its
transaction.
After proper investigation I discovered that he was involved in an auto Accident
that took his life. And the deceased customer did not have on records with the
bank in any close relation. Prior to this discovery, I was Compelled to assume
responsibility for monitoring this fund, which is quite difficult for me due to
my position in my bank.My proposal to you is for us to conclude this transaction
together, as I cannot claim this fund by myself.
I am ready to share it at ratio 60:40, 60% for me and 40% for you. I will like
to assure that this transaction is risk free, but privacy is required and
cannot be compromised. Please send to me your private phone number and fax, so
I can give you more details I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that
you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my
direct email: mark1johnson2000@yahoo.fr
Regards,
Mr. Mark Johnson.
