Subject: fcntl and flock wakeups not FIFO?

I've been doing some experimenting with locking on 2.4.18 and have 
noticed that if I have a number of writers waiting on a lock, they are 
not woken up in the order in which they requested the lock.
Is this expected?  If so, what was the reasoning for this and are there 
any patches to give FIFO wakeups?
Thanks,
Chris
