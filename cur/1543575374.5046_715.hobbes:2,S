   >atomic_t does not guarentee a large enough range necessary for mm->rss
   If we haven't some atomic_t that can be negative we could define atomic_t 
   as unsigned long for all arch,
   this is sufficient to fitting all the range for the mm->rss.
32-bit Sparc has unsigned long as 32-bit, and the top 8 bits of the
atomic_t are used for a spinlock, thus a 27-bit atomic_t, there
is not enough precision.
