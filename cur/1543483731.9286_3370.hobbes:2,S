This might be a bug in strace or it might be the kernel returning
something totally unexpected.  Probably the first.  Ulrich has an
updated strace somewhere, check ftp.cygnus.com.

Strange - you should've seen something like this:
write(4, "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 8192) = ? ERESTARTSYS (To be restarted)
--- SIGPIPE (Broken pipe) ---
close(4)                                = 0
sigreturn()                             = ? (mask now [])
write(4, "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 8192) = -1 EBADF (Bad file descriptor)
followed by a write to the console, and syslog() returning.

Yes, the debugging hook can do things to processes that ordinary kill(2)
can't.

SIGPIPE kills a process by default.  syslog() overrides that, but only
while it's active.

Then the bug is unlikely to be in syslogd, unless the pipe has gotten
lost from syslogd's select() fdset.  You ought to be able to check
that with lsof and strace.
