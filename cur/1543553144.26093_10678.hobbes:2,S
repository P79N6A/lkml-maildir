Hi Jeff,
Did I speak too quickly again?
Can you successfully do 'depmod -ae' _before_
booting this kernel?
I still get lots of unresolved USB symbols in
all USB modules.
Is it valid to run depmod like this before
booting the kernel that has usbcore in-kernel?
depmod -ae works after I boot that kernel + usbcore.
