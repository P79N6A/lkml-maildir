The thing is - 2.6.20-rc5-rt3 didn't provide clockevent on PXA, so, I took 
Sascha's patch instead of my own, which I've been using with 2.6.18, as 
his patches were already submitted to various lists and had chances to 
become mainline. And strait away it didn't work. The code above seems to 
be doing something close to Sascha's patch, so, I expect it would behave 
in the same way. And until I introduced a minimum increment for the match 
register, it didn't work. I either got hangs, or WARN_ON dumps about "time 
warp detected". I think, any timer related code for PXA has to be tested 
on real hardware under significant (real-time) load before going upstream. 
Haven't tested -rt7 though, so, maybe it is already handled there?
Thanks
