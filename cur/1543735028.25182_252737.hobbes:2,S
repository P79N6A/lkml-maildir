ROFL, and this is my position on this topic as well.
There are absolutely no justified economics in these
TOE engines.  By the time you deploy them, the cpus
and memory catch up and what's more those are general
purpose and not just for networking as David Stevens
and others have said.
TOE is just junk, and we'll reject any attempt to put
that garbage into the kernel.
