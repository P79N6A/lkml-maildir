Exactly. Why criticize devfs for not solving a problem that
the current system CANNOT solve?
At least with devfs you have to reach farther to find a problem.
There are problems with the current system that _are_ solved by
devfs.  I have yet to see or hear of a solution to all of these
problems that has _any_ running code attached to it.
