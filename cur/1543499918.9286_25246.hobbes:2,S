Hello,
I missed a few mails, so don't shoot me if this has already been said
(or is completely stupid), but I can imagine the following situation:
 - An error happens (i.e. a mm bug in EROS)
 - EROS doesn't discover it and writes VM to harddisk.
 - A few minutes later the system crashes do to the mem-corruption.
 - After booting, the mem-corruption has already happened, so it will
crash again.

Advantages of Windows NT over Linux:
 * It's easier to explain the crash was not your fault.
 * You've to remember only one solution all to your problems: Reboot.
 * You can use your mouse to type an email-message.
