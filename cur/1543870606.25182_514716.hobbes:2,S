In theory I /think/ so, but it would probably end up being an 
overestimate of the coverage actually needed. Trapping at runtime is 
arguably more elegant?

My understanding is that pretty much arbitrary hardware access can cause 
SMM transitions without OS notification, though this is getting outside 
the areas I know about.
