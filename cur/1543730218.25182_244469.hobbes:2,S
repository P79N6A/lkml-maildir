Subject: [PATCH 2.4] CRIS architecture update
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/8/23/91

As requested on this list a while ago I send patches for the
CRIS architecture here before they are sent to Marcelo/Andrew.
Most of you doesn't care at all and that's just fine.
If you have any objections/improvements or want time to review 
anything notify me during the next few days. If I hear
complete silence the patches will go in next week.
Also tell me if you want this in any other format.
The most interesting things included in the patches are:
IDE driver modifications for >= 2.4.21
Kernel debug console cleanups and improvements
Added support for isoc out in USB driver
Performance improvement by implementing MMU refill in assembler
Improved multiple interrupt handling
