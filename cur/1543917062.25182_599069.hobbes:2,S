Auke, that's a good question, but I found it hard to find any info about it.
There's no discussion on it in Documentation/, and very little I could find
elsewhere.  I did see one url explaining what un/likely does precisely, but
no guidelines.  My understanding is that it can improve performance, as long
as it's used carefully (otherwise it may hurt performance).
Background: we used un/likely in Unionfs only sparingly until now.  We
looked at what other filesystems and kernel components do, and it seems that
it varies a lot: some subsystems use it religiously wherever they can, and
some use it just a little here and there.  We looked at what other
filesystems do in particular and tried to follow a similar model under what
cases other filesystems use un/likely.
Recently we've done a full audit of the entire code, and added un/likely
where we felt that the chance of succeeding is 95% or better (e.g., error
conditions that should rarely happen, and such).  So while it looks like
we've added many of those in this series of patches, I can assure you we
didn't just wrap every conditional in an un/likely just for the sake of
using it. :-) There are plenty of conditionals (over 250) left untouched b/c
it didn't make sense to force the branch prediction on them one way or
another.
So my questions are, for everyone, what's the policy on using un/likely?
Any common conventions/wisdom?  I think we need something added to
Documentation/.
Also, Auke, if indeed compilers are [sic] likely to do better than
programmers adding un/likely wrappers, then why do we still support that in
the kernel?  (Working for a company tat produces high-quality compilers, you
may know the answer better.)
Personally I'm not too fond of what those wrappers do the code: they make it
a bit harder to read the code (yet another extra set of parentheses); and
they cause the code to be indented further to the right, which you sometimes
have to split to multiple lines to avoid going over 80 chars.
Cheers,
Erez.
