Thx for the fast reply. I wouldn't use the third method (3 -> using
kernel directly) in one of my projects, but I have to try each one of
the three methods for a small assignment (unfortunately, not every
assignment is very useful at a university :-))
So, I would be very grateful if you have some code snippets or further
information for me about method #3.
thx again
