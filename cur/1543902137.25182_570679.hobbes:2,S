When there are issues with indentation, those braces are actually not 
unneeded any more, except for the compiler.
Just _look_ at the code. The indentation is not obvious, because the 
if-conditional itself is multiple lines, and indented (arguably wrongly so 
too, but that's another issue).
So it's no longer a trivial one-liner statement, it's a "multi-statement" 
spread out over multiple lines, and I think the braces are actually a good 
idea for things like that.
I also encourage people do do braces when you have nested indentation, ie
	if (something)
		if (somethingelse)
			return;
is actively *wrong*, while
	if (something) {
		if (somethingelse)
			return;
	}
is right, even though the braces are "unnecessary". Again, it's about the 
visual representation, not about whether the compiler needs them or not.
