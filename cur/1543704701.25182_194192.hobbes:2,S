Scott,
thanks for the patch. Again, 3/4 of working day with moderate server 
load resulted in no
WATCHDOG barking with the patched kernel and tso's turned on. I dare say 
that this is it! :-)
(Little more testing here won't harm though)
If nothing, the stability of the e1000 has vastly improved
Thanks a lot!
Regards,
Petr
