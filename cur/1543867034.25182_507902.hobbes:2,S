We don't have Xen merged, and it doesn't look like we're going to get it
soon.  Also the code is only for dom0 which will take even longer.
At this point I'm pretty sure the code is cleaner, simpler and easier to
maintain if you just split out a xendom0swiotlb instead of messing up
the existing code.
