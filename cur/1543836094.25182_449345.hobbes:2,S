Hi,
I wander what happens it the klog-daemon do not work. Will the kernel log 
messages stored somewere in the kernel-memory, or are they discarded?
Is it posible that, after a amount of time the kernel crash, bescause of that?
I could not find anything about this in the manpage of klogd or in the kernel 
documentation.
Thanks for your help
Sven Anders
