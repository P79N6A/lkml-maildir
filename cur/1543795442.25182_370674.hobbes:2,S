It would be a bit different from what you propose.

Rob, if you want me to just ignore you, then please continue like this.

The point is that it's close enough to allnoconfig, so that it's IMO not 
worth it. I'm trying to explain, what would be needed to do it properly, 
but either I failed to make myself understandable or you're not listening.

At this point I was just wondering, whether you realize that I wrote the 
new kconfig stuff.

I'm actually quite interested in the needs of the users, but OTOH users 
have to realize that they are not always _exactly_ get what they want. 
Users often have very specific wishes and I try to provide a generic 
framework, which not only solves specific problems but also a broad range 
of problems, which often means to compromise as user needs can be very 
contradictory.

I think I understand you quite well. Again, the basic functionality you 
want is already provided by allnoconfig and the advanced features need a 
bit more work than the few hacks you added to conf.c.
I like the idea of a minimum config, which e.g. users can send to 
developers or they can use for upgrading kernels, but this has to work not
just for you, but also for the majority of users and this requires a 
better specification of how this feature should work in various 
situations.
bye, Roman
