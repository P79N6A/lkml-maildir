Jeff's choice is a bit surprizing. That being said, it would had been nice
to fast-forward net-2.6 from a442585952f137bd4cdb1f2f3166e4157d383b82
to Linus's upstream before applying the content of
12aa343add3eced38a44bdb612b35fdf634d918c in order to keep the drift
with Linus's branch to a minimum during the bugfix cycle.
