    We should, but we don't. 2.4 does the right thing.
    2.2 got the following change back in 2.2.6:
            res = PTR_ERR(dentry);
            if (!IS_ERR(dentry)) {
                    res = permission(dentry->d_inode, mode);
    +               /* SuS v2 requires we report a read only fs too */
    +               if(!res && (mode & S_IWOTH) && IS_RDONLY(dentry->d_inode))
    +                       res = -EROFS;
                    dput(dentry);
            }
    ... and that's what really ticks me off - permission() does the right
    tests in case of read-only fs (ignoring the r/o vs. r/w for devices and
    FIFOs), but sys_access() explicitly overrides that.
    IMO we should revert that in 2.2. HP/UX is probably hopeless - if they
    will ever start caring about bogus behaviour access() will not be anywhere
    near the top of their list ;-/
Yes. Alan, it seems we all agree that
