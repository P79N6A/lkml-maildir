No my code. The hotplug event results in a message which is stored in a
linked list which is protected by a lock. To query the device I need to
queue a message in that linked list which is obviously locked. So
everything is timed out.
I need to make the device query asychronous from the hotplug. Not perfect,
but the only memory safe way of doing it I think.
