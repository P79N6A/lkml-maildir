Nope. It doesn't say that. Maybe if you wrote the code. But if Andries
or I had written that line, it just says that when written the
programmer thought about the initial value, and that the initial value
matters on this variable. 
It is a concise form of documentation. As Andries explained, this can
also be done with comments or with 
	static int a /* = 0 */; 
However, I like the "=0" variant much better. 
If you're worried about the inefficiency of the compiler, take it up
with the compiler guys. Or write an extra preprocessor step or
something like that.
