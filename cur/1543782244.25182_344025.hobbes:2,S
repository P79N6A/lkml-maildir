Subject: [PATCH] (10/43) Kconfig fix (DEBUG_PAGEALLOC on m32r)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/23/238

DEBUG_PAGEALLOC is broken on m32r - the option had been blindly copied from
i386; kernel_map_pages() had not and that's what is needed for DEBUG_PAGEALLOC
to work (or link, while we are at it).
