There have been further developments,

The second patch makes libata turn off the warning message and just
issue STANDBYNOW without userland modification, iff userland
halt/shutdown doesn't issue STANDBYNOW during shutdown.  I'm not sure
whether this will be accepted or not.  It makes the change much less
intrusive for distros which don't issue STANDBYNOW from userland but
disks will always do emergency-unload on all kernels with this problem.

AFAIK, yes, all SCSI disks attached to a single host and shares power
on/off status will do emergency unload on poweroff.  In the updated
kernel, this is controlled by the following sysfs node.
 /sys/class/scsi_disk/h:c:i:l/manage_start_stop.
It defaults to 1 for libata devices and 0 for all others.  Echoing 1 to
it makes the sd driver spindown the device on suspend to ram/disk and
poweroff.
