Hello,
Finally.   I'm running 2.2.0 + ISDN ... and I am almost pleased!   For
those interested I've uploaded a mini howto on:
	
http://www.brisse.dk/site/linux/isdn.htm
... explaining the steps involved in upgrading.
Question:  am I the only one experiencing delays when listing f.ex. a
tar archive or even a normal directory?
Kind regards,
Brian
