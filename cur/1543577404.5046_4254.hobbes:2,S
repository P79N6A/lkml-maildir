What do you mean with "without an interrupt assignment"?
Is there no line for ethx in /proc/interrupt, or the number of
interrupts remains 0?
what does `lspic -vxx` say about the interrupt number?
Is there a BIOS setting similar to "Pnp aware OS"? For the 2.2 kernel
that must be "No", 2.2 might run with "Yes", but I'm not sure if the
850i board is supported.
