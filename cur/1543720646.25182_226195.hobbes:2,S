Hi, recently we bought 12 identical Supermicro servers. On these
we run Fedora Core 2 with all available updates through yum.
On most of our other servers we have the ability to monitor the
cpu temperature through '/proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/temperature'
and this works fine. We monitor most servers using rrd graphs.
Now, the problem with all these supermicro servers is that the
temperature seems to be stuck at 27 C. No matter what load or
temperature in the room. Something is clearly wrong.
What can be done to fix this? We tried setting polling_frequency
to '10', but that made no difference.
What can be done to fix this? Btw, lm_sensors finds no chips.
The specs of the model can be found here:
