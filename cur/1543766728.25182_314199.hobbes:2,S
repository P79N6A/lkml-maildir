Agreed - but this is a different problem than "shutting down IRQs".
My point was arch specific code knows how to mask all IRQs.
irq_disable() is expected to work regardless of what state the
driver is in.  On kexec "reboot", kernel drivers can unmask IRQs
as they normally would during initialization. No?
