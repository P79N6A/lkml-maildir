The following tests all have acpi_evaluate_integer() hacked to return
_TMP=27C.

device->pnp is a struct and I couldn't figure out how to printk it, so
I just printk'ed device->pnp.bus_id (most of its other elements aren't
initialized by then anyway):

It produced nothing surprising:
ACPI: pnp.bus_id=0xe3ed7830
ACPI: pnp.bus_id=0xe3ed7430
ACPI: pnp.bus_id=0xe3ed7030
ACPI: pnp.bus_id=0xe3ed8c30
ACPI: pnp.bus_id=0xe3ed4030
for THM0,2,6,7, and _TZ.
So I still don't know why getting rid of THM2 in the kernel causes the
panic.
But while I had this kernel booted, I tried a few sleep cycles, and it
hung on the second one as expected (it's just the vanilla kernel&DSDT
with acpi_evaluate_integer() hacked to return _TMP=27C).

It looked like the usual hang, but I had debug_{layer,level}=0x10.  I
increased debug_layer to 0xFFFFFFFF it to see the function traces.
However, the hang didn't occur even after 15 cycles. So I rebooted with
debug_layer=0x10 and still couldn't reproduce the hang even after 12
cycles.  But the same kernel hung yesterday after 4 cycles [I save all
the kernels tagged by their revision hash], so I don't know what to
think about THM6.

Right, it booted fine when I removed THM2 from the DSDT instead of from
the kernel.

I tried the kernel with THM2 taken out of the DSDT, and it was fine (so
the total change was that plus _TMP faked in acpi_evaluate_integer()).
