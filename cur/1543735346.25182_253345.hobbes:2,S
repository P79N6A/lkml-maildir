Great!
I was the one who wrote those patches, so I'm glad to know that they 
actually made a difference in real world workloads (like using "top").
Reading /proc/kallsyms should be a lot faster too, although there is no 
comparison with 2.4 kernel, because there where no kallsyms there. It 
can be compared with previous 2.6 kernels, though.
