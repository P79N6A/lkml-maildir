Great. Since I don't have the HW I need your help.
Please stick printk()s in drivers/acpi/events/evsci.c acpi_ev_sci_handler().
I'd like to know where in there it is hanging, and if it is ever returning.
I don't know your level of comfortability in all this so please email me if
you need more explicit instructions on what I'm asking for.
Thanks in advance! ;-)
