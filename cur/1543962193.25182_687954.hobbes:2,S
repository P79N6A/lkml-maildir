you make a valid point here : "we lose testers in the meantime". Maybe
it would help if -rc2 would be released a few days after -rc1 with
the first most obvious showstoppers (often build issues). The most
problematic ones are often fixed within an hour or so, but for most
testers, it still means they have to wait for -rc2.
Most external testers might then only try -rc2 first, but that's not
a problem. What we really want is them to test widely and not revert
back at the first problem. If only 20% of testers try -rc1, and the
remaining 80% actively wait for -rc2 3 days after, then we'll get
broader testing in the first two weeks.
