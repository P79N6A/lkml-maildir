I meant on the not known-to-be-nearly-unusable boards. Or are you saying that
on the other boards the APIC bus could be lossy too, but it's very unlikely? 
[my personal feeling would be to consider the lossy APIC bus to be a hardware
problem, like an MCE that cannot be really handled]

I suspect when you have a lossy APIC bug you will run into problems with other IPIs too,
it's really an uphill fight which you are likely to lose.
Anyways, having a clear BUG will make it easier to evaluate if there is really
a problem.
