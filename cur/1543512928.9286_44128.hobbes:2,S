Thanks for your quick response.
I am willing to upgrade, but I just want to make sure why
I am doing it.
I assume it's in everyones best interest to avoid the older
as86 and ld86 and this is the 'price' we pay.  Thanks for
the work you've done to achieve this.

I try to follow the minimum recomendations in the Changes file, and
use it to keep my system up to data.  The system I am running is
derived from a 1995 slackware distribution, and have upgraded it through
3 computers.  (I have another system running from a 1993 install)
I believe that there are many others that do not wish to
install whole fresh 'modern' distributions when what we have has been working
for many years.

So you are saying, before this patch 2.8.1.0.23 was the minimum, but
now that THIS code is added that 2.9.1.0.7 is the minimum.
Was there anything wrong with 2.8.1.0.23 except for the boot code?

Could you explain what you mean here a bit more please?
What are some examples of sub-optimally assembled code that
will be more optimally assembled when using 2.9.1.0.7?
Are you refering to relative branch optimizations.
I'm not really a fan of 'optimizing' assemblers :-)
