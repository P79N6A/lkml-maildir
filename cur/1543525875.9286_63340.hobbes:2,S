I also have troubles with smbfs (but with kernel 2.2.14 and Samba
2.0.6). I mounted a NT4 share, and the machine locked up solidly. No
ctrl-alt-del, nothing. (I don't have SysRq compiled in)
smbfs isn't very reliable here: before the lockup, I also experienced
troubles. Sometimes the mounted share just disappeared, but did show
up with the 'mount' command without arguments.
I'm using a k6-2-400 with a SiS chipset, 64 MB mem.
