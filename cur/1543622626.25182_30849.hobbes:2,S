Marcelo,
 Contratulations on your first "official" kernel release.  It seems to have
gone
 well (except for some complaints on slashdot about -rc4 SPARC patches
missing from
 the patch, but apparently in the full tarball).
 Now I need to know about the status of several unofficial patches:
	XFS
	LVM
	i2c
	Crypto
	FreeS/WAN KLIPS
	LIDS
	rmap
 Shawn was very helpful regarding the XFS+rmap patches --- though I've been
having 
 some trouble with compiling kernels out of that in some configurations
(I'll try to 
 isolate those and submit a coherent bug report, if I can.  Shawn, are you
going to 
 update your set of XFS+rmap patches soon?
 Marcelo, there were some i2c updates included in the lmsensors package,
have they
 submitted those to you for integration into 2.4.19?
(As for the patch-int, that seems to apply with only a couple minor rejects,
to the
 top level Makefile, and Documentation/Configure.help; so that's not a
problem --- 
 beside I want KLIPS, LIDS and patch-int for home, not for work.)
