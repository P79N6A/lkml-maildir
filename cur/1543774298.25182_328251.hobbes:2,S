In fairness, there are some things that I am aware of.  In Reiser4 fsync
performance needs optimizing, truly random modifications and anything
else that write twice logging is best for needs optimizing, workloads
dominated by dirtying more mmap'd pages than can fit into RAM need
optimizing.

Wow.  You know, Nikita complains about my benchmarks, but what I usually
hear from users is that their performance when they use their favorite
app is mostly similar to my benchmarks.
I would be really happy if our compression code was working before we
went in.  Half the space and thus twice the speed to disk.  Edward could
use some help with it.  If only we could work on that plus fsync plus
mmap dirtying plus random modification optimized journaling rather than
these flamefests.
