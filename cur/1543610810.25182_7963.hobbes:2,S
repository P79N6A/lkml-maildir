there is a case where the binary tree has less cache footprint than the
hash - when big continuous areas of files are cached, *and* the access
patterns are linear. In this case the binary tree uses only the continuous
mem_map[] area for its data structures - while the hash uses the hash
table as well. (which is +12% or +25%, in the stock/buckets variant.)
