No, icc surely supports attribute(packed).  My point is that we shouldn't
rely upon the gcc info file for this, because other compilers can (or
could) be used to build the kernel.
So it would be safer if the C spec said (or could be interpreted to say)
"members of packed structures are always copied bytewise".  So then we
can be reasonably confident that this change won't break the use of
those compilers.
But then, I don't even know if any C standard says anything about packing.
Ho hum.  Why are we talking about this, anyway?  Does the patch make the
code faster?  Or just nicer?
