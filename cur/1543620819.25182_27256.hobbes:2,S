Thanks for correcting the documentation - it was out of date and erroneous.
The keepalive packets are simple tcp segments sent on the connection:
- no data
- ack # is next expected byte
- sequence # is a stale (byte already acked by the other end) one, so that
the
  other end is forced to send an ack in return (as it receives an out of
window
  sequence #).
I cant imagine how a firewall would be filtering them..
thanks,
Nivedita
