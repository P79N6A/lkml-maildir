The behavior should indeed be identical.  Both implementations
restrict MADV_FREE to work on anonymous memory and it is unspecified
whether a renewed access yields to a zerod page being created or
whether the old content is still there.  So, just use 0x5 for both the
Linux and Solaris version on sparc.
