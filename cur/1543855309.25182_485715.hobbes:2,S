I _think_ what you're describing here is a false-positive oom-killing?  But
Martin appears to be hitting a genuine oom.
But it does appear that some changes are needed, because lots of things got
oom-killed.
I think.  Maybe not - there's no timestamping in those logs and it is of
course possible that we're seeing unrelated ooms which happened a long time
apart.
