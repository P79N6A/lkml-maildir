Ah: that's what it was. The migration code got harder with my mlock
code (although I did have something that should have worked in theory,
it involved a few steps).
I don't have a particular problem with putting mlock pages on the slow
scan lists, although if you have huge mlocked data sets, you could
effectively speed up slow scan list scanning by orders of magnitude by
avoiding the mlocked pages.
I won't push it now, but I might see if I can rewrite it one day :)
BTW. if you have any workloads that are limited by page reclaim,
especially unmapped file backed pagecache reclaim, then I have some
stright-line-speedup patches which you might find interesting (I can
send them if you'd like to test).
