Hi Niall,
Join the club.   I suspect the scsi-layer to be the culprit.  It's the
only difference between my 2.2.9-machine (pure-scsi) at home and my
2.2.9-machine (pure-ide) at work.
I never encountered lockups in 2.2.5 or 2.2.7 ...
Anyway, it propably isn't the scsi-layer but I can't relate to the
heavy-load theory - my machine didn't do any heavy stuff when it locked 
;o)
Kind regards,
Brian
