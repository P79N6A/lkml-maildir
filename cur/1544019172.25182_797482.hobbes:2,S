Looking at the current -git code, there appears to be an option for 
memory controllers to do this (the set_sdram_scrub_rate() routine), but 
there don't appear to be any controllers that can actually do it.
edac appears to currently be able to scrub the specific page where the 
fault occurred.  This is a useful building block, but doesn't provide 
the ability to march through all of physical memory.
