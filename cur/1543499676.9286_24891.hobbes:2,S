I tried this patch on a Cx586, AMI BIOS(1994), kernel 2.2.10. The good news
is that it compiled and booted without a hitch. The bad news is I cant
report on it's effectiveness; there's no e820 call in this BIOS. No ill
effects are showing from the patch. /proc/sys/vm/* all report report good
numbers, both with and without the BIOS memory hole enabled.
I'll run this a few days, but will only follow up if I hear loud noises or
see purple smoke.
