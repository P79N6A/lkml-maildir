Because an SUID program can change its UID back.
At least, one that was SUID root.  OTOH, any
program running as root can change UID, so we
should probably not allow root to get nonzeroed
pages.

Besides the non-enforcing of SELinux security
labels (and maybe namespaces?), I cannot think
of anything.

I think the process that actually calls the page freeing
functions is always the process that owned the page, so
going for current->mm should work.
Getting the UID wrong for file pages caught in a truncate
is fine, since the process obviously already had access
to the data in that page.
