Probably because I'm too lazy to find a nice way to fix it :)
smp_nmi_call_function may return an error but I don't see any place
where the return value is actually checked. If the error case is
actually possible, we should check the return value, and the warning
would disappear.
Sorry but I'm not familiar enough with this code to know what's the
good solution :(
