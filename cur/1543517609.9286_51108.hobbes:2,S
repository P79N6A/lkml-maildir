All right, I've noticed an odd bug in at least the latest release
kernels. Free space seems to be 'leaking' on FAT partitions. I'm not
sure exactly when it started, its a slow and gradual thing... I've
noticed this in at least 2.2.12, which I'd been running for some months,
I recently upgraded to 2.2.13, just before this finally registered in my
mind as a serious problem when I needed some space for mastering a CD
burn...
(don't take the size values as gospel...)
It got to the point where windows was saying there was 1.4gb free on my
FAT32 D: partition, and Linux was insisting there was 270mb. I did a cat
/dev/zero >/Ddos/foo which filled the 270mb space Linux thought there
was, went to windows, It said there was 1.2 gb free, I ran Norton
Scandisk, no complaints, I duplicated the foo file until there was 210mb
left, went back to Linux, now it says there's 210mb free, deleted the
foo files, 1.4gb free. Did a cp /dev/zero>foo again, filled the 1.4 gb,
while I was at it, I filled my FAT16 C: too. Went back to windows, it
now agrees there's no disk space left on D:, however there's a few
hundred mb of leaked space on C:. So its not just FAT32. I went back to
Linux and deleted foo on D:, yay, now I seem to have my full 1.4gb back.
I was then able to burn the CD...
Norton has never complained about either partition, other than the usual
lost clusters after windows crashes and burns... I've never had any
problem accessing files under Linux or Windows, or noticed any corrupt
files, so doesn't seem to be a serious data loss situation. Since it has
persisted over many many reboots, and a few different kernels, it must
be something in the way Linux is interperating the FAT filesystem...
Its still happening, a day or two later I tested and found about 160k
leaked on D:... I've searched the list, and nothing even close seems to
have been mentioned before... Am I the only one seeing this? I know some
C, but this is too big for me... Help me oh kernel wizards. :)
