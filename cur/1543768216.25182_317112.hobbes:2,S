You don't have to set the kernel time during time_init(), and this
is especially true with I2C RTCs.  The only thing that time_init()
has to do is to start the kernel tick going.
There is no reason why it can't be initialised during the normal
driver initialisation - which is how we do it on a number of ARM
platforms.
There are some ARM platforms where we can only get the time via
ntpdate, and this is also satisfactory.
So please don't get hung up on the x86 way of doing things.  It's
both conceptually wrong and actually unnecessary.
