Setting the block size in io_rw_ext_helper() has several drawbacks, namely:
1. Reduces the flexibility of drivers to manage what commands are performed.
2. A performance penalty on the first transfer.
3. Greater code complexity.
4. Non-intuitive location for card initialization code.
Sure we could just through hoops and add (much) extra complexity to the
core, to improve item 1 but 2, 3 and 4 are insoluble. Given that setting
block size before the first command has /zero/ benefits[1], why bother?
Your insistence on this stupid idea baffles me, particularly in the
light of your other useful comments.
I would also like to advise that until a larger number of function
drivers become available that the core is kept as simple and as flexible
as possible.  Without knowing how different cards operate it is
difficult to know what's common behaviour and what's card specific.
My latest (and hopefully final) patch set follows.

[1] dynamic block sizing was (potentially) a useful benefit but I have
comprehensibly shown it's not beneficial.  The idea that is somehow
necessary to permit the core to change it's block size selection
algorithm is bogus.
