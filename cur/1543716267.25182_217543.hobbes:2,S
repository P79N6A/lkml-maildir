I'd still love to see practical problems this thing is solving.  It's
a few thousand lines of code, not written to linux style guidelines,
sometimes particularly obsfucated with callbacks all over the place.
I'd hate to see this in the kernel unless there's a very strong need
for it and no way to solve it at a nicer layer of abstraction, e.g.
userland virtual machines ala uml/umlinux.
