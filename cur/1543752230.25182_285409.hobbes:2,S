Hi there,
We have an Apple Xserve RAID, connected through a FC switch.  The RAID 
has LUN-masking enabled, such that one of our Linux boxes only gets LUN 
1 and not LUN 0.  We're running the 2.4.x kernel series now, since this 
is under a RHEL envinronment.
The problem is this: since LUN 0 does not show up -- specifically, it 
can't read the vendor or model informaton -- the kernel SCSI scan does 
not match with the table to tell the kernel to do sparse LUN 
scanning... so the RAID does not appear.
I can make the RAID show up by injecting a add-single-device to the 
SCSI proc layer.  Trivially patching scsi_scan.c to always do sparse 
scanning works as well.  No hokery with max_scsi_luns or ghost devices 
works.
I'm considering making a patch to add a kernel option to force sparse 
scanning.  Is there a better way?
Thanks in advance,
--Jim
