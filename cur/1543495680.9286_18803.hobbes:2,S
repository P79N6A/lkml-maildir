You're ignoring very important issues of recoverability. If a process is
doing work that involves writing to disk, then it should be written out
regardless of whether the disk is shut down or not.
If you're concerned about writes because of atime modifications, then I
would suggest you turn off atime modification.

You can do the first and last one by tweaking the bdflush parameters.
