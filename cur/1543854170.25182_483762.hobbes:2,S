i've released the 2.6.18-rc6-rt4 tree, which can be downloaded from the 
usual place:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
NOTE: the YUM repository has changed the -rt kernel's package name, it's 
now kernel-rt, so it does not override the kernel package. If you have 
rt.repo already then just do a "yum install kernel-rt".
If there's no rt repository yet, the -rt YUM repository for Fedora Core 
6 can be activated via:
   cd /etc/yum.repos.d
   wget 
http://people.redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/rt.repo
   yum install kernel-rt
a number of fixes were done since -rt3, and merges of Linus' latest -git 
tree.
to build a 2.6.19-rc6-rt4 tree, the following patches should be applied:
  
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.18.tar.bz2
  
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/patch-2.6.19-rc6.bz2
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/patch-2.6.19-rc6-rt4
as usual, bugreports, fixes and suggestions are welcome,
	Ingo
