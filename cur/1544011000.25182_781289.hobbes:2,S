Things like mov ...,%eax are zero-extend so they'll zap the high 32 bits.
The real problem are byte return values generated via things like:
   movb $1, %al
those wont zero-extend, so you could get garbage in the output. One 
approach would be to try a quick hack just to see how common a problem 
this is.
We could extract the return type from the debuginfo, hash it in a 
read-mostly table and then look it up, but that seems complex both in 
terms of build overhead and in terms of runtime overhead.
