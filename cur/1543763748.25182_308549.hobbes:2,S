Subject: [PATCH] ppc: fix single-stepping of emulated instructions
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

On ppc, we emulate instructions that cause alignment exceptions.  If
we are single-stepping an instruction and it causes an alignment
exception, we will currently do the next instruction as well before
taking the single-step exception.  This patch fixes that, so we take
the single-step exception after emulating the instruction.
