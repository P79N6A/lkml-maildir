  Actually there were two quota patches in Alan's tree. The first one was
just some fixes in quota code - some locking changes, race fixes, dynamic allocation
of quota structures. This patch went into 2.2.12.
  The second patch is patch which implements new quota format. It makes
changes in quotactl() interface and other changes visible in userspace.
I think that is the reason why Linus doesn't want it in 2.4 and I agree with him.
