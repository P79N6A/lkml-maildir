Well, as you seem to have never been bitten by that bug; let me assure you
the problem is very real.  Each file (,v file) can live in the repo for
many years and has to servive any spurious writes to be usable.  The
curruption of such files (in my experience) only shows itself if you try
to access its history; which may be weeks after the corruption started,
and you can't use a backup for that since you will overwrite new versions
added since.
Think about it this way;  nfs servers are known to corrupt things;
reboots can corrupt files, different clients will try to write to
the file at the same time quite often during the lifetime of the file, cvs
clients get killed during writes or network drops the connection during a
session.
Considering that the ,v files have a lifetime of years, with many
modifications during that time, I think its amazing corruption does not
happen more often.
CVS was pretty good at keeping files sane, but I'll go for a solution that
completely sidesteps said problem any day.
