I agree this is probably safe in the current implementation.
However, I think the current implementation is just broken because
we can't really handle hotplug of ACPI devices.  Specifically, I think
the first TBD in acpi_bus_check_device() should be fleshed out so it
does something like pnpacpi_add_device().
So my dissenting opinion is that this patch would just get reverted
soon anyway when somebody finishes implementing ACPI hotplug, and
therefore it's not worth doing.
