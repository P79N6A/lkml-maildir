When you're shutting down your computer, trashed displays are irrelevant
anyway. Shutting down to single user mode is of course an exception, though,
so you do have a point.

Agree wholeheartedly. Also bringing me back to my original example: I don't
think running a second server is `stupid'. X servers were designed to allow
themselves to be run multiple times. If the framebuffer driver doesn't let
this happen, it's a bug in the framebuffer driver.

This is actually supposed to be a feature: it's to protect against the server
crashing and refusing to terminate, which will definitely leave your console
unusable.
(as an aside, make -j is completely useless unless you have 10-12 processors
in your machine, except for stress-testing the kernel)

suid programs should be written to be able to deal with such circumstances.
Unexpected events can happen due to any number of causes. suid programs don't
have the excuse that they were run by root, so he can be blamed for anything
that goes wrong.
