But we still have global locking in that readdir by means of the
BKL. There should be no nasty races...

Definitely. In most cases we *cannot* wait on I/O completion because
nfs_zap_caches() can be called directly from the 'rpciod' process by
means of a callback. Since 'rpciod' is responsible for completing all
asynchronous I/O, then truncate_inode_pages() would deadlock.
As I said: I don't believe the problem here has anything to do with
invalidate_inode_pages vs. truncate_inode_pages:
  - Pages should only be locked if they are actually being read from
    the server.
  - They should only be refcounted and/or cleared while the BKL is
    held...
There is no reason why code which worked fine under 2.2.x and 2.4.x
shouldn't work under 2.5.x.
Cheers,
