I don't believe this is a typical HT configuration as you are thinking of it.
There is a hypertransport capability that implements a rough equivalent
of a per device ioapic.  It is quite similar to MSI but with a different
register level interface.
Since native hypertransport devices do not implement a pin emulation mode
as native pci express devices do so if you want an interrupt you must support
the native hypertransport method.
The pathscale ipath-ht400 driver already in the kernel tree uses these
and uses so an ugly hack to make work that broke in the last round of
the msi cleanups.  I also know of a driver under development for a
device that uses these as well.
So I want to use this so I can get irqs from native hypertransport
devices.
