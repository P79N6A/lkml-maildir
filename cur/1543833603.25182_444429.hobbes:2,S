Capabilities are not a single fundamental privilege set and they  
don't interact at all nicely with virtualization.  If we're going to  
do this properly we need to divide capabilities up into different  
sets applied to different objects.  For example, the CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE  
capability should _really_ be per (PID,vfsmount) pair, although that  
would probably be exceptionally inefficient, so as an optimization we  
could make it per (PID,target_uid_ns) pair.  That maps very  
conveniently to the kernel keyring system, where we can make a "uid"  
keytype indexed by target_uid_ns and containing three things:  A  
process-manipulation UID (think euid), a file-manipulation UID (think  
fsuid), and a set of per-uid-ns capabilities.  Similar mappings  
should be set up for most of the other capabilities.  Normal cap_set  
and cap_get and capable() calls on those particular capabilities  
should look up and modify the "uid" key associated with the current- 
 >nsproxy->uidns namespace, and extra calls should be added to modify  
capabilities with respect to specific UID namespaces.
Here's a list of capabilities that should probably be in each "uid" key:
CAP_CHOWN
CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE
CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH
CAP_FOWNER
CAP_FSETID
CAP_FS_MASK
CAP_SETGID
CAP_SETUID
CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE
CAP_IPC_OWNER
