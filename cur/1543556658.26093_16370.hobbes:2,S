Now, this is with a bog-standard PIIX irq router, so we definitely know
that we have the pirq table parsing right. I even have unofficial
confirmation from intel engineers on this.
But I see something obviously wrong there: you have busmaster disabled.
Looking into the UHCI controller code, I notice that neither UHCI driver
actually does the (required)
	pci_set_master(dev);
Please add that to just after a successful "pci_enable_device(dev)", and I
just bet your USB will start working.
Johannes, Georg, the above is a fairly embarrassing bug, and is likely to
explain a _lot_ of USB failures (the OHCI driver does do this, btw).
