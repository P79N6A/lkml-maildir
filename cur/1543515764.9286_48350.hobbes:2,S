 It's anyone working on this ?? ... I have this chipset on my notebook and
I want to use the multimedia extension it has, such as the PAL/NTSC video
input/output features ...
 If someone is interesting on this .. I have Intel's specs for the
chipset, the problem it's tha I don't have time to do it and the enought
knowleadge about kernel programming, are there anywhere more info about
how to program a v4l driver than the API.html info from the kernel
documentation ???
 Thx in advantage.
