Either use modules or otherwise make sure st.o is in the kernel.
Then... you use /dev/st0...stn. 
Major/minor numbers determine how the device responds. If you want
to have the device not rewind on close (when using `mt`) then you
use the device with the minor number = device+128.
There are no special problems with the DEC except that it's slow.
cd /
tar -clf /dev/st0 .
Will back up your entire root file-system.
