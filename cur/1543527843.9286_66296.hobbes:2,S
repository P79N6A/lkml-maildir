Please dismiss if this is irrelevant to the forum.
On my Athlon 500/Microstar 6167 - machine, the power-off on shutdown
does not work with 2.3.47 as it does with 2.2.13.  Does anyone know why
that is? And why does the code specify restart  here
(i386/kernel/apm.c):
#ifdef CONFIG_APM_REAL_MODE_POWER_OFF
        machine_real_restart(po_bios_call, sizeof(po_bios_call));
Restart is exactly what I get when this option is enabled.
Sincerely
