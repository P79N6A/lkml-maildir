Roland and I have continued the conversation but we took it off the LKML
since it was really getting into the nitty-gritty details of the
implementation and wasn't that interesting to someone not actually
directly involved.
The upshot is that I have a proposed patch that I have handed to Roland
to review.  He's pretty busy, though, so he may not have gotten to it
yet.  Perhaps this thread will give him further incentive. :-)
Petr's analysis pretty much matches mine, except that he went into a bit
more detail in actually computing numbers and whatnot whereas I just
reasoned that with a sufficiently large number of threads pretty much
any process that uses POSIX timers can cause the system to livelock,
simply because repeatedly running the thread group list in
run_posix_cpu_timers() will at some point take as long as the timer tick
itself.
My proposed patch that Roland is reviewing corrects the implementation
of run_posix_cpu_timers() to make it run in constant time for a
particular machine by defining a couple of new structures and keeping
the thread group timers in one of these.  It's way more complex than
this and I have a README that goes into detail if anyone is interested.
I've tested the patch with as many as 200,000 threads (all of which are
running a prime number sieve and are therefore CPU bound) and it appears
to work fine.  Before I post it again, though, I want Roland to sign off
on it.
