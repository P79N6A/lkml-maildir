Subject: ssh no longer working after upgrading from 2.6.19.2 -> 2.6.21.1

Hi,
 after upgrading a system from 2.6.19.2 to 2.6.21.1 access to that
system via "ssh" has stopped. The ssh-clients accessing the 2.6.21.1
box just hang and cannot even be killed.
 The upgraded system has a RHEL4U3 user-space. 2.6.21.1 configuration
was derived from 2.6.19.2. Both configs are attached.
 Any ideas would be highly welcome. Please CC me, as I am not
subscribed.
Thanks
Martin
