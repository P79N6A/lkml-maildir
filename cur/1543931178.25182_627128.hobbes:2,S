I think this was previously (pre-2.6.24) not the case, which is why e1000 et al
has this check as well and that's exactly what is causing most of the
net_rx_action oopses in the first place. Without the netif_running() check
previously the drivers were just unusable with NAPI and prone to many races with
down (i.e. touching some ethtool ioctl which wants to do a reset while routing
small packets at high numbers). that's why we added the netif_running() check in
the first place :)
There might be more drivers lurking that need this change...
