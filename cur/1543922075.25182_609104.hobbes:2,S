Subject: [PATCH] DMA: Correct invalid assumptions in the Kconfig text
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch corrects what I hope are invalid assumptions about the DMA
engine layer: Not only Intel(R) hardware can do DMA, and DMA can be
used for other things than memcpy and RAID offloading.
At the same time, make the DMA Engine menu visible again on AVR32. I'm
currently working on a driver for a DMA controller that can do
mem-to-mem transfers (which is supported by the framework) as well as
device-to-mem and mem-to-device transfers (not currently supported.)

Don't get me wrong; I think Intel deserves lots of respect for
creating this framework. But this is also why I got a bit disappointed
when I discovered that it seems to be less generic than I initially
hoped.
DMA controllers, which may support plain memcpy acceleration in
addition to more traditional "slave DMA", are very common in SoC
devices, and I think Linux needs a common framework for it. The
existing DMA Engine framework seems to come pretty close already, but
I think it needs more input from the embedded crowd before it can be
completely usable on a large number of embedded systems.
I'm not going to suggest any changes to the actual framework for
2.6.24, but I think the _intention_ of the framework needs to be
clarified.
