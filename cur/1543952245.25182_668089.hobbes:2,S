I think I have the answers to some of the above questions.

These are roughly the list of functions that were responsible for the
timer interrupts across all cpus including the ones in idle.  Most of
the functions complete the job in interrupt context and also re-queue
the timer.  The count number is the call count in the 120s observation
window across all 4 CPUs.
I got these function addresses from __next_timer_interrupt() in
timer.c.  Previously, I did not look in timer.c since hrtimers were
enabled and I assumed all timer call will be through __run_hrtimer
from hrtimer.c.  The call count of __run_hrtimer was very minimal and
did not correspond to the local timer interrupt count.
These are device driver timers that we need to investigate.  We should
try to migrate them to CPU0 (or some other package) to get really long
uninterrupted CPU sleep time.  
I will post more results after tweaking some of the above timers.
Should PowerTop include local timer interrupt counts as well during
the observation period?  Interrupt do significantly affect CPU sleep
time whether they wakeup any process or not.
Comments?
