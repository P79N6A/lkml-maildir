Hi.
These are patches that I have now.
Patches:
  [1/4] memcg: don't trigger oom at page migration
  [2/4] memcg: remove mem_cgroup_try_charge
  [3/4] memcg: avoid deadlock caused by race between oom and cpuset_attach
  [4/4] memcg: change try_to_free_pages to hierarchical_reclaim
There is no special meaning in patch order except for 1 and 2.
Any comments would be welcome.
Thanks,
Daisuke Nishimura.
