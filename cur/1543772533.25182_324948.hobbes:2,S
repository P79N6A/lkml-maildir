Subject: [PATCH 2.4.31 0/9] gcc4 fixes overview
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/6/12/57

This set of patches fixes gcc4 problems in the 2.4.31
kernel's 'core' code. I've been running gcc4-compiled 2.4
kernels for several months on i386, x86_64, and ppc32, and
there are currently no known regressions compared to gcc34.
Note: you'll want to use recent gcc-4.0.1 snapshots as
gcc-4.0.0 is known to be broken.
This set of patches do not include fixes to drivers,
file systems, or architectures I don't use myself. I
have a preliminary patch kit for those, but as it
has received only limited compile testing I'm not
submitting it unless these core patches are accepted.
The patch set consists of the following 9 parts:
[1/9] fix incomplete array errors
[2/9] fix static-vs-nonstatic redefinition errors
[3/9] fix nested function declaration errors
[4/9] fix undefined strcpy linkage errors
[5/9] fix x86_64 acpi assembly error
[6/9] fix x86_64 sys_iopl() bug
[7/9] fix const function warnings
[8/9] silence pointer signedness warnings
[9/9] fix i386 struct_cpy() warnings
