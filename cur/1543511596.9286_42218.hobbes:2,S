No, it's normal. /dev/pts is the root of the pseudo-terminal
filesystem. It's not a "real" filesystem so the size shows as 0.
Since it's a mounted filesystem, you can't remove the directory.
Unmounting it (when it isn't busy) will get rid of it but I doubt
that's really what's wanted (I haven't read the original query,
though).
