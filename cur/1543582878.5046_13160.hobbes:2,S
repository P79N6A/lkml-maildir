Hi kernel developers!
Can someone tell me how to find out the parameter i have to pass to the ISAPNP_FUNCTION(x)?
This is my cat '/proc/isapnp' output:
------------
Card 1 'TER2111:TerraTec ActiveRadio' PnP version 1.0 Product version 1.1
  Logical device 0 'TER2111:Unknown'
    Supported registers 0x2
    Device is not active
    Active DMA ,0
    Resources 0
      Priority preferred
      Port 0x590-0x590, align 0x0, size 0x1, 16-bit address decoding
      Port 0x591-0x591, align 0x0, size 0x1, 16-bit address decoding
      Alternate resources 0:1
        Priority acceptable
        Port 0x590-0x5a8, align 0x7, size 0x1, 16-bit address decoding
        Port 0x591-0x5a9, align 0x7, size 0x1, 16-bit address decoding
      Alternate resources 0:2
        Priority functional
        Port 0x590-0x5c8, align 0x7, size 0x1, 16-bit address decoding
        Port 0x591-0x5c9, align 0x7, size 0x1, 16-bit address decoding

To start, I would call (taken from the radio-cadet.c driver):	
dev = isapnp_find_dev (NULL, ISAPNP_VENDOR('T','E','R'),
		                       ISAPNP_FUNCTION(???), NULL);
Is this correct? How do I know what to pass to the ISAPNP_FUNCTION?
The doc. says, I can take it from the /proc/isapnp file, but which value is 
it?
I tried '0', but that didn´t work.
Can someone help me please?
(If possible please CC me)
Thanks,
Rolf
