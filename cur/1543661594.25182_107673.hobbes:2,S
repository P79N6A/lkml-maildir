My understanding is that LSM was created at the request of Linus because there 
were several groups of people who had different patches for security policy 
in "core code".  Linus apparently didn't like that idea and requested a 
framework so that Linux would not be tied to one particular security model.  
Someone please correct me if my understanding of LSM history is incorrect.
Now as for the issue of code to use the hooks, SE Linux uses almost all the 
hooks and I'm sure that Steve can send in the appropriate patch at any 
time...
