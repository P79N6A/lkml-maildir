Hi all,
I have created today's linux-next tree at
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sfr/linux-next.git.
You can see which trees have been included by looking in the Next/Trees
file in the source.  There are also quilt-import.log and merge.log files
in the Next directory.  Between each merge, the tree was built with
allmodconfig for both powerpc and x86_64.
There was only one minor merge problem.
We are up to 38 trees, more are welcome (even if they are currently
empty).
Status of my local build tests is at
http://kisskb.ellerman.id.au/kisskb/branch/9/.
  We have added a 64bit
s390 compiler to our list.  If maintainers want to give advise about
cross compilers/configs that work, we are always open to add more builds.
Also, the linux-next tree is being build/boot tested by the guys at
test.kernel.org.  Thanks to them.
