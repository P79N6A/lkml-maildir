Hi guys,
I've been using an old single processor / linux 2.4 iptables based 
firewall for a few years.
Now it's time to upgrade that machine, so, I am wondering, would it be 
of real benefit if I put a two-processor system for a firewall? This 
machine is going to have 4 NICs, it's going to make routing (lots of 
routes), and firewall (iptables). I don't know if these kind of tasks 
take advantage from a multiple-processor architecture. Please enlighten 
me :)
Thank you!
