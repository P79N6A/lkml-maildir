yeah, correct - fortunately this is a non-default path, but still a nice
fix.

actually, rcu_read_lock_read() is the variant that _can_ be called
recursively and which i used in the networking code quite extensively.
The others are only useful if the locking is 'flat' in the original
code, or if the locking is extensively rewritten. (I havent tried to
convert the IPC code back from the 'flat' locking to the original
'nested' locking, but i've done it for the networking code.)

which codepaths do you mean? Things are looking pretty good in -U10.3 so
far.
