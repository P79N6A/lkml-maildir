Once we have a support for hardware cryptocards it will be usefull. I'm
already having the VIA PadLock patch that adds yet another AES
implementation. For VIA C7 it will also support SHA (one module, two
algorithms? why not ;-)
IMHO it is worth having it done "right and expandable" since the
beginning (changing the /sys tree once it goes mainline will be harder).
