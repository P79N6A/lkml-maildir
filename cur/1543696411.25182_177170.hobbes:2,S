Hi!
I have a PC here with an intel i875p chipset which seems not to recognize
logical partititions. 2.4.18 (kernel bf24 image) boots fine, but i do
not get a 2.6.0-test5 or 2.6.0-test9 to boot.
I compiled all necessary IDE drivers in, IDE, ide disk and piix and
such. All attempts yield in
Kernel Panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on hda5
I tried to submit root=0305 and such to pass to it. On my later
investigations I realized that the partition recocnizion seems to fail.
When booting Kernels report
hda: hda1 hda2 <hda5 hda6>
and boot, this one reports only:
hda: hda hda2
So, where are the logical ones?
In "Advanced partition selection" I switched on 
"PC BIOS (MSDOS partition tables) support" but that made no
difference...
hm. what next?
Regards, Konsti
