Sort of. vplay works, mixers segfault.

The oldest data sheet is the 688. The a 1994 press release mentions the
488 as a 12 bit mono. I'm going to hack sb_ess to let it know to look
for a 488 and then treat it like a 688 and see what happens. It's no big
deal, but Alice likes the B&W screen any you can't get them anymore.
Thanks,
