Subject: [PATCH] 2.4: export scheduling information from /proc
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Menacing Marcelo,
Attached patch exports scheduling policy and real-time priority from
/proc/<pid>/stats.
This code is in 2.4-ac and 2.5.
This does _not_ break previous versions of procps -- there is no harm
and it is fully backward compatible.  New versions, starting with 2.0.8,
can parse this information.
Patch is against 2.4.20-pre9.  Please, apply.
