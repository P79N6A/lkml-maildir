Aha, thanks.  I probably configured out the AMD756 when we switched to
this board from an actual AMD 7xx board, thinking it was no longer
appropriate.  I'll make the change this weekend.

It could certainly be hardware, but it seems awfully unlikely that that
would occur exactly when I upgraded the kernel.  A kernel bug just seems
the most parsimonious explanation, to me.
