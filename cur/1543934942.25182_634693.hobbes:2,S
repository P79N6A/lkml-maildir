I have been trying to figure this out a while now with printk's all over my kernel as well as adding kdb and tracing the int3 events.
I have tried various 2.6 kernels and so far all i have tried do this.
 My current tests are on 2.6.22.10 
 I have a simple init binary I compiled static that is my init that is loaded into an init file system. I am not using cpio but that did not seem to matter.
---- begin testinit.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
   printf("Hello world!\n");
   sleep(999999999);
}
---- end
 I am using syslunux to start my kernel and appending the follwiing startup command most of this is specific to my true init script but again im using a "hello world" script to debug this for now.
append  debug kidb=early console=ttyS0,384008n initrd=ufoinit.img init=/testinit rw var_size=12M tmp_size=MAX log_size=16M root_size=64M root=/dev/ram0 boot=/dev/hda1,msdos rw pkgpath=/dev/hda1:msdos rw verbose DELAY=0 TEST=0 DEBUG=0 VERBOSE=0 UFO=root,etc,modules
 On an intel CA810EEA 800mhz board or QEMU this runs fine but on the via boards it dies right after "Freeing unused kernel memory: 132k freed"
 
 on the 500mhz board it dies every time on the 800mhz it is random.
 I have noticed that i get the elf binarly loading into user space with some page_faults then I get blasted with do_notify_resume with 0x04 or TIF_SIGPENDING over and over as if its in an infinite loop.
 This begins shortly after load_elf_binary -> clear_user i think right after a page_fault during the clear_user. I dont even know why that signal is being sent on other hardware it never happens.
 I am not even sure what do try next.
 I have been trying to get my distro up on 2.6 for a while now and away from 2.4 but im currently stuck here.
 Any and all suggestions and help welcome..
my kernel config is here

 Thanks in advance..
