I think you're an idealist. If this were something other than tar it would
be simple, and you would be right. Well, you ARE right, but a change which
breaks tar, which many sites use for backups, is really not practical,
without a loophole until tar gets fixed. And as Alan noted, keeping track
of the physical position is very hard, and getting a tar fix might take a
while.
None of the choices is good; I see:
 - leave it the way it is
 - fix the hole and break tar
 - wait for FSF to fix tar, then fix the hole
 - try to fix it without breaking tar, which may not be really possible
   and could leave part of the problem and still break tar somehow
 - fix it, and leave the admin a way to build a kernel with the hole other
   than just reverting the fix
I proposed the last, I won't cry if no one else likes it, it just seemed
realistic for people who don't use certain features of tar.
