I've been trying to measure this.  On IA64 I'm measuring around
2.5microseconds (on a 900MHz machine).  I personally think that this
is too big, and could be reduced.
One thing I think we need to do early in 2.7 is to merge all those
architecture-dependent arch/XXX/kernel/irq.c files, and try to reduce
the amount of duplicated work done in the new merged file and the
lower level architecture-specific files.
