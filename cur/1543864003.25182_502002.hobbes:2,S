I fear you are taking the Windows approach, that the computer is there 
to serve the o/s and applications have to do things the way the o/s 
wants. As opposed to the UNIX way, where you can either be clever or 
stupid, the o/s is there to allow you to use the hardware, not be your 
mother.
Currently applications have the option of letting the o/s make decisions 
  via open/read/write, or let the o/s make decisions and tell the 
application via aio, or using O_DIRECT and having full control over the 
process. And that's exactly as it should be. It's not up to the o/s to 
be mother.

Any process can ignore SIGTERM, or do a significant amount of cleanup 
before exit()ing. Complex operations need to be completed or unwound. 
Why select Oracle? Other applications may also do that, with more or 
less valid reasons.
