Actually, ext3 doesn't work that way.  The atime update will go into the
"running transaction", which is an instance of journal_t which is separate
from the committing transaction.
But there are situations (ie; journal free-space exhaustion) where things
can go synchronous.  They're more likely to occur during metadata storms
though, and perhaps indicate an undersized journal.
But yeah, overall point agreed with.

Could be IO scheduler borkage, could be ext3 borkage.  A well-timed sysrq-T
will tell us, and is worth doing (please).
Does increasing the journal size help?

It would be better if we can avoid creating the second global variable.  Is
it not possible to remove dirty_ratio?  Make everything work off
vm_dirty_kb and do arithmetricks at the /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio interface?
We should perform the same conversion to dirty_background_ratio, I suspect.
And these guys should be `long', not `int'.  Otherwise things will go
pearshaped at 2 tabbybytes.
