    No tcp connection establishment with 2.4
    [Description]
    I know these sites use some versions of linux:
    www.libero.it
    www.iol.it
    www.arianna.it
    and some other outside Italy.
My guess was TCP_ECN, but when I try even with this enabled it works.
If it fails for you still try:
	echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn
and see if that fixes it.
