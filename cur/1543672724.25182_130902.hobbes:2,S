I have no idea, what a 'typical processor' might look like. But the
thing most CPU seem to have in common is that they save two registers
either on the stack or into other registers that only exist for this
purpose (SRR on PPC).
Once that has happened, the OS has the job to figure out where it's
stack (or equivalent) is located, *without* clobbering the registers.
Once that is done, it can save all the registern on the stack,
including SRR. It might also move what the CPU has pushed to the
"stack" somewhere else.
After the interrupt has been handled, the reverse path is executed,
restoring registers in the correct order, possibly switching from
kernel to user stack, etc.
And there is one kernel stack per process. Please don't argue about
that, unless you have read the code.
