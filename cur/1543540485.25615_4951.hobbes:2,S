There's a bug in kmod.c in test6-pre1 that I didn't notice because I
don't have it compiled in by default (now fixed - kmod is needed for
hotplug anyway). 
The fix is along the lines of changing
	free_uid(current);
to
	free_uid(current->user);
	current->user = INIT_USER;
	atomic_inc(&current->user->__count);
to match the new semantics of "struct user_struct".
(The new "struct user_struct" allows for proper tracking of per-user
resources, not just how many processes a user has, and that requried
some changes in how it works).
