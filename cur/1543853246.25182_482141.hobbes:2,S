Hi Oleg,
thanks for your response.

Yes it is a 2.6.17.11 stable kernel. - By the way: we tried to setup
kernel 2.6.18.2 on that machine but we got a weired time error, ntpdate
shows two times: first run correct time, second run time is half an hour
in the future - so we switched back to 2.6.17.11

In detail:  a Kernel BUG in /var/log/messages is written and after that
the cpu load average is climbing up to 20-30, any tries to shutdown the
system, kill processes umounts etc. are in vain. Than the system freezes
completely: no keyboard, nothing.
 cheers,
