	Hmm, what is the intended future interaction of DM and MD?  Two
ways at the same problem?  Just curious.
	Assuming MD as a continually used feature, the "name" bits above
seem to be preparing to support multiple shared users of the array.  If
that is the case, shouldn't the superblock contain everything needed for
"clustered" operation?
