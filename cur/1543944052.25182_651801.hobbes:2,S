Sorry - page 34 was just the first reference to "Extended Configuration
Registers" when I originally scrounged up the info for willy.
Page 69 is in fact what I wanted to point at ("DEVPRES1" reg).

It should. But doing a quick check now only shows one other copy
(in .es domain :) when searching for "30300702.pdf". 
Searching for the full document title results in several intel.com
locations and lots of other misc references that don't look quite right.
Many of those just reference the "product brief" and not the data sheet.
yahoo.com gives similar results.
thanks,
