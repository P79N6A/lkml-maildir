I disagree.  Robustness is only an additional mutex attribute on top of
the mutex type.  I.e., there can be robust
normal/error-checking/recursive mutexes.  What kind it is can be told to
the kernel at the time the robust mutex is registered with the kernel.
This is the way I'll write up the proposal for robust mutexes for
inclusion in the next POSIX revision.
