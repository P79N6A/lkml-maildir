Please understand that I'm not saying UIO isn't potentially useful,
nor am I saying that it won't potentially give us support for a bunch
of new hardware.  All I'm trying to say is that, to me at least, it is
trying to buy us those new drivers in a way that encourages creating
those drivers as closed source software- *that* is all I'm having
issues with - that is what I think is a step backwards - something
that may give us a short-term gain but will make us lose out
long-term.

That something has been going on for years doesn't in itself make it a
good argument for that model.  ;-)

I'm not arguing against closed source applications in userspace. That
is of course OK. What I'm arguing about is a kernel interface that
encourages closed source (userspace) *drivers*.
