Actually, at one point we went over inputs with vojtech and tried to
fix the locking. We tried adding spinlocks, but it got really ugly
really quickly. Then we figured out that set_bit() and friends should
be enough to do spinlock-equivalent without getting that ugly.
We did not have enough energy to solve plug/unplug races at that
point; but other races should have been fixed. It is possible that we
overlooked something and doing set_bit() instead of spinlocks is
broken. If it is so, please tell us.
