Why would BSD advocates be applying patches to the linux kernel?  (You don't 
need the tool to read a patch for ideas, do you?)  Why would BSD advocates 
apply a GPL-licensed patch to the GPL-licensed Linux kernel, and then 
complain that the tool they're using to do so is GPL-licensed?
I'm confused.  (Not SUPRISED, mind you.  Just easily confused.)
