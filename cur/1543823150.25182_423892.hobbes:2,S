There is a note in the performance section from the NFS-HOWTO[1]. It
suggests adjusting the r- and wsize mount parameters:
_._. .._ _  .... . ._. .  __..__  _._. .._ _  .... . ._. .
Directly after mounting with a larger size, cd into the mounted file
system and do things like ls, explore the filesystem a bit to make sure
everything is as it should. If the rsize/wsize  is too large the
symptoms are very odd and not 100% obvious. A typical symptom is
incomplete file lists when doing ls, and no error messages, or reading
files failing mysteriously with no error messages. After establishing
that the given rsize/ wsize works you can do the speed tests again.
Different server platforms are likely to have different optimal sizes.
