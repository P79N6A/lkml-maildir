Are you running some kind of sniffer tool on these machines. That
message itself is the last sniffer type application exiting. If you are
running such a tool then it tells you that the shutdown got that far
into the shutdown scripts which may help the search.
2.6.9 also has some quite nasty bugs and other problems so trying
something newer might help. 10rc2 has a fairly number of the problems
fixed and  a few new ones (eg it won't boot on some boxes) but might be
useful to at least see if you are chaasing a fixed bug. Ditto possibly
2.6.9-ac although nothing in your oops stands out and identifies with
any specific fixed bug.

The oops is at least fairly clear - at some point in the shutdown
scripts fuser
was run (quite possibly to clean up processes before unmounting a file
system).
It seems to have hit corruption in the dcache.

This is ARLA stuff ?

Thats a known 2.6.x bug fixed in 2.6.10rc2 hopefully (its a collection
of SCSI bug fixes and USB fixes - removing the CD triggered quite a few
different problems). This one isn't (yet) fixed in 2.6.9-ac because of
the number and complexity of patches.

X isn't very bright about MTRR overlap but it should be harmless.
