Sh "not working" is a side effect of the fact that there is no one 
maintaining the sh kgdb work.  As an example, the sh-lite.patch which is 
part of the kgdb git tree explicitly says that the sh-sci.c needs to be 
"re-ported".  There were many changes since the 2.6.17 code base that 
KGDB was upreved from and the fact of the matter is that I have no sh 
hardware, tool chain, or means to support it.   I will happily merge in 
the pieces to fix up the sh kgdb arch specifics.  The same was true of 
IA64 at first (meaning it did not work), but Bob Pico submitted some 
further patches and IA64 is should compile build and work with kgdb.
In the development branch, the kgdb core is compiled and test and should 
work for the archs i386, x86_64, ppc, powerpc (32 & 64), mips (32 & 64) 
and arm.
Jason.
