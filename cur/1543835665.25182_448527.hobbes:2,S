the disk before was correctly booting linux and windows2000.
then i used the dos6.22 fdisk (?? unsure about the exact dos version)
to delete and recreate a partition. then a began a format /s and
interrupted hafway because it was too slow.
i am not sure that the partition i deleted with fdisk was the first of
the disk.
It was some time ago, i dont remember clearly.
