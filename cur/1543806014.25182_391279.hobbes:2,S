I'm suggesting that if the only real problem that dsa in the kernel
solves is module signing, then perhaps one can simplify the problem.
For instance, if instead of going for a general signing mechanism in the
kernel that will take any old module and verify it, you define a
particular binary as being trusted, and then devise a signature that the
kernel can check (even the SHA-1 of the binary image might be
sufficient).
The object would be to give the kernel a trusted program that can check
module signatures on its behalf.
Cheers,
