Yes, ppa zip drive has the same issue.
yield shows a spin in top if it's the only running task. Otherwise it
will wait other task to run first. The behaviour has changed a bit
between 2.4 and 2.6, and we changed the corner cases. But the semantics
of yield are still the same.

Minor detail: sleep_on is obsolete and should be deleted since it
requires the big kernel lock or the global cli to be safe. But I got the
point ;)

This is a case where you know when you can expect the hardware to be
done (just like it was the case for the ppa zip). While dealing with
long hardware delays schedule_timeout makes plenty of sense. It would be
pointless to yield and spin, if you know nothing good can happen in the
next millisecond.

With schedule_timeout(1) you're probably going to become interactive,
and you'll be scheduled before other tasks. That's good. I mean the
scheduler sorts things out automatically.

It's as well a waste of energy power to spin when you can
schedule_timeout(1).
So you're optimal at using schedule_timeout(1) in this case while
waiting hardware to complete as far as I can tell.
