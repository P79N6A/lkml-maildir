hey, hey. your patch doesn't help in this situation (much)!
inodes and dentries can still consume much memory.
it just makes the situation a bit better.
I wonder whether it is easy to have the following done with your implementation:
container tasks visible from host. theoretically having 2 pids (vpid, pid)
it should be implementable. Do you see any obstacles?
in other regards patches look pretty good. Good job!
