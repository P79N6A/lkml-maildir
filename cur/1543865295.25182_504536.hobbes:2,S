Since I still think that the many-thousands potential async operations 
coming from network sockets are better handled with a classical event 
machanism [1], and since smooth integration of new async syscall into the 
standard POSIX infrastructure is IMO a huge win, I think we need to have a 
"bridge" to allow async completions being detectable through a pollable 
(by the mean of select/poll/epoll whatever) device.
In that way you can handle async operations with the best mechanism that 
is fit for them, and gather them in a single async scheduler.
[1] Unless you really want to have thousands of kthreads/fibrils lingering 
    on the system.
