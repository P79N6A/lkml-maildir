If I make an estimate, I would say that a great majority of the warnings
are present wether I compile 2.4.20-SuSE, 2.4.21-rc1 or 2.4.21-rc1-ac4.
This seems to be a common (deliberate?) theme throughout parts of the
kernel tree.
I could quite well go through and start fixing things (despite me not
knowing C particularly well) but I would, by someone who knows the
kernel quite well, appreciate an estimate of how likely the result is to
be horribly broken.
As I see it, there might be instances where the comparision between a
signed value and an unsigned value could produce a defect. If people
think this is a good thing to fix and there are people that would accept
patches in normal diff -u format, I could spend some time trying to fix
part of this.
Regards,
/Anders
