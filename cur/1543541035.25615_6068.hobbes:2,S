You mean I do "ln -sf /dev/urandom /dev/random" ?  Nah... ;)
Several people sent me a private email sugesting to use urandom instead,
but it's not what I use, it's about what all software on the machine uses.
Should I patch SSH? Should I patch SSL? Or are they using urandom anyway?
The issue here is that /dev/random is not working. Apparantly because 
add_interrupt_randomness is not called from the SMART2 driver. But then
again, no add_*_randomness is called from any scsi/*.c driver.
The only call to add_interrupt_randomness I can find is in */kernel/pci.c
from handle_IRQ_event and I don't understand why this one never gets called
on this machine. Also the only call to add_blkdev_randomness is in ide.c. 
Why is there no call from any of the scsi/*.c drivers?
