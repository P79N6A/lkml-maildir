Sure. But this is not legally binding.

Ok so are thousands of others who are using Linux as their OS of
choice in embedded systems. They are not doing this because they are
eager to give back back. They are doing it because Linux provides

chosen VxWorks or OSE too. They chose not to, but not because they
were unwilling to be a parasite.
