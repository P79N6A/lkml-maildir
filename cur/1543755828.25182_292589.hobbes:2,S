Ok, reproduceable without ssh makes narrowing this down much easier.
Are you seeing errors on the interface? No would indicate problems
post CRC checking on the receive side. Do errors happen in both
directions? If not, it may be CPU speed-related or specific to a given
NIC - swap them if they're not onboard. 
The next test is to send patterns. Try sending yourself a gigabyte of:
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i < 0x10000000; i++) {
                fwrite(&i, 4, 1, stdout);
        }
}
If there's some sort of partial DMA transfer going on, this should
make it evident.
