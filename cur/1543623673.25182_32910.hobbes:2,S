The configuration I would try first on 2.4.19pre1aa1 with 2.5 GB of RAM is 
CONFIG_3GB=y and CONFIG_NOHIGHMEM=y.  If that causes some other problem,
I'd go with CONFIG_2GB, then finally CONFIG_1GB.  Each config changes
the user/kernel memory split.  The loads I've run suggest for best 
performance:
	CONFIG_2GB > CONFIG_1GB > CONFIG_05GB
On my 1GB box, I've been running CONFIG_2GB for a couple months and 
performance is great.  Only lingering question for me is the handling
of oom.  Oom hasn't caused be a problem, but I haven't seen the oom
killer do it's work when I create an oom condition.
BTW, Andrew Morton's read_latency2 patch is a winner.  The read_latency2
diff I use on my 2.4.19pre1aa1 boxes is at:
