The real issue is that Linus dislikes the current kiobuf scheme.
I do not like everything he proposes, but lots of things makes sense.

Ok, great.

I don't see any real advantage for disk IO.  The real advantage is that
we can have a generic structure that is also usefull in e.g. networking
and can lead to a unified IO buffering scheme (a little like IO-Lite).
