Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi All,
Here is the third attempt on implementing relocatable bzImage for x86_64.
Following are the changes since V2.
- Broke suspend/resume code changes into smaller patches. Pavel, I hope
  now it is easier to review.
- Moved cpu long mode and SSE verfication code into a single common 
  file (arch/x86_64/kernel/verify_cpu.S). This file is not shared at all
  the entry places.
- Fixed a bug during resume operation on machines which support NX bit.
Your comments/suggestions are welcome.
Thanks
Vivek
