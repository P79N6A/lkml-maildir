Mostly this one.  The translation units that do the EXTERN_INLINE
defines also define tables containing (among other things) pointers
to all of these functions.  So we *know* that we require one out-of-line
copy in one translation unit, so we might as well make that version the
canonical out-of-line copy.
Also, I seem to recall some multiply-defined symbol something or
other the last time someone messed with our inlining construct.
