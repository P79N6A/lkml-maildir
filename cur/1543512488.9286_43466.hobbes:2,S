   Unfortunately, we use the interrupt routing table not only for fixing bad
IRQ's, but also for detecting peer host bridges.  We could disable this BIOS
call by default, make it an option and hope that all new multi-bus machines
will provide the $PIR table and handle the rest by chipset-specific kludge.
				Have a nice fortnight
