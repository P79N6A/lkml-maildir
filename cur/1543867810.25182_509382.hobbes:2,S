Slight difference; if a compulsory warning sometimes happens for code 
that is perfectly fine, the warning is bad. I do want to be _able_ to 
get as many warnings as a compiler can muster though.
Given char's special nature, shouldn't the conclusion of this thread 
have long been simply that gcc needs -Wno-char-pointer-sign? (with 
whatever default, as far as I'm concerned).
