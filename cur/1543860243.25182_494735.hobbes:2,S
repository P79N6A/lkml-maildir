Subject: [PATCH] remove 556 unneeded #includes of sched.h

After Al Viro (finally) succeeded in removing the sched.h #include in 
module.h recently, it makes sense again to remove other superfluous 
sched.h includes.
To ease the pain, this time I did not fiddle with any header files and 
only removed #includes from .c-files, which tend to cause less trouble. 
Also I left alone anything else that looked like any trouble, like hunks 
that didn't apply cleanly against both mainline and -mm trees. You see, 
I'd really like to get the patch through this time.
Compile tested against 2.6.20-rc2 and 2.6.20-rc2-mm2 (with offsets) on
alpha, arm, i386, ia64, mips, powerpc, and x86_64 with allnoconfig, 
defconfig, allmodconfig, and allyesconfig as well as a few randconfigs on 
x86_64. I also checked that no new warnings were introduced by the patch 
(actually, some warnings are removed that were emitted by unnecessarily 
included header files).
