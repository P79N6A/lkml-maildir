This is absolutely NOT WHAT YOU SHOULD DO.
You should INSTEAD, send a mail to postmaster@vger.kernel.org
asking why you were removed.
People who continually keep resubscribing eventually get black
listed.  This means DO NOT DO IT.  Ask why you are being removed
so that the problems at your site can be fixed.
When an address bounces, it puts a major burdon on both vger and
the postmasters here.
