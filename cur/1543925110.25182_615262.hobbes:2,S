Thanks, that helps.  I read over the mmc changes in between those two
commits, and I think I found the problem... could you please try the
patch below (on top of the latest kernel) and report back how it
works?  Unfortunately I am traveling and I don't have an SD card with
me to test on my laptop...
Pierre, assuming Romano tests this patch successfully, please apply!
Thanks,
  Roland

mmc: Fix sg helper copy-and-paste error
Commit 45711f1a ("[SG] Update drivers to use sg helpers") had the
following bogus change in drivers/mmc/card/queue.c:
    > -			src_buf = page_address(src->page) + src->offset;
    > +			src_buf = sg_virt(dst);
(Notice that "src" is converted to "dst").  Turn this "dst" back into
the intended "src".
