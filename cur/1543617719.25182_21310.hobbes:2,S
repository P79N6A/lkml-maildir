   - Support for expanding, shrinking containers.
- LVM Plugin
   - Supports adding/removing objects (PVs) from containers in the GUI or the
      EVMS command line.
- MD Plugin
   - Runtime support for Linear, RAID-0, and RAID-1.
      - Sync and spare-failover available for RAID-1.
      - Hot-add for RAID-1 still under development.
  - Engine support for Linear, RAID-0, and RAID-1.
      - Discovery, creation, deletion.
  - Engine discovery support for RAID-5. No creation yet.
  - Recommended to NOT use the EVMS MD plugin and the original MD driver in
     the same kernel.

   - Support for missing elements in a drive-link. Exports the drive-link in
      read-only mode to allow recovery of data on the remaining elements.
- AIX Plugin
   - Minimal discovery in user-space. Constructs all containers without
      exporting any regions.
- Text-Mode Interface
   - All code and features added. Needs additional testing.
- Kernel
   - Supports specifying an EVMS volume as a "root=" kernel boot-parameter.
- Lots of testing and bug-fixes.
