Well, yes, I think so. The problem is I don't have a good "before"
situation to compare with. I installed a database service doing 
some logging every 5 minutes and upgraded from 2.2.8-pre5 at the
same time. After that when the database is doing its stuff both 
the database process and netscape gets stuck in D-state in wait_on_page
for many seconds while the disk (Adaptec AIC7xxx contr) is trashing 
like mad. If I close netscape during this I can see the netscape
process staying in wait_on_page for up to 15 seconds before it exits.
The computer (a PPro-200, 160MB) is being so unresponsive that I've 
ordered a new one. I sort of thought it was just being overloaded, 
and maybe it is, but processes being stuck in D-state for such a long 
time doesn't seem right. And since you asked...
And it's not swap related. Or at least vmstat doesn't say so. Though
it is allways deep into swap. Right now when X is not running:
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        160512     157532       2980      39880       3276     115928
-/+ buffers/cache:      38328     122184
Swap:        72288      26980      45308
( I know this is not a good and detailed report, but since I haven't seen
  anyone else seeing this I still am not sure it's a bug. And I don't want
  to flood the list with ps output and every litle detail if it isn't.)
