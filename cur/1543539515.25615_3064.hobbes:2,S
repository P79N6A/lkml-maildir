Root can only talk directly to the hardware when given appropriate 
capabilities - CAP_RAW_IO I believe.
If anything Andre should just be looking at adding that capability to
the accesses which allow you to destroy things - because those same
ioctls potentially serve useful purposes (yes, one day you will want
to upgrade your drive firmware without running DOS/Win - I already
don't have DOS/Win on any of my computers or laptops, the closest I
have to it is a small portion microcode from the Hollywood Plus driver
extracted to use with the Linux driver for that card...).
And believe it or not, on a laptop which is only ever used behind a
company firewall or when dialed up over a rather securely filtered
dial-up, the chances of someone locating it on a dynamic IP and
hacking root given no access to any open ports are somewhat more
remote than the chance of the drive vendor developing a firmware
upgrade tool for Linux, given appropriate interfaces.
Remember, as long as root can insert a module root can re-write the
kernel security model from the inside... and as soon as root can't
insert a module you've removed popular functionality.  (Personally I
don't use modules but honestly - the vast majority do and probably
always will.)
David.
