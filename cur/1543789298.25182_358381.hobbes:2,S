Subject: [PATCH 1/1] Kconfig help text for RAM Disk & initrd
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Felix Oxley <lkml@oxley.org>
Amend Kconfig help text for RAM Disk & initrd to suggest that
these features should be answered Y.
Remove loadlin as an example of a boot loader, replace with grub.
