So, looking for some closure here, what do we think is the "root cause"? 
Is it:
1)  a defect with Intel's S5000PSL motherboards that is exposed by an 
otherwise fine new (since 2.6.19) Linux kernel feature? (in which case 
we and others should probably press Intel to recognize they have a 
problem, seeing as they only "officially support" distributions running 
on 2.6.16 or below so maybe they don't even know about this issue).
2)  a problem with PCIEAER? And maybe "CONFIG_PCIEAER=y"  should NOT be 
the default setting? (in which case the kernel maybe needs fixing)
3)  just a bad interaction between a good motherboard and a good Linux 
feature that don't play well together? (in which case this is a kernel 
"feature" that anybody compiling a kernel to run on the Intel S5000PSL 
motherboard should know not to enable -- maybe a note is warranted so 
that when configuring the kernel, people with S5000PSL motherboards 
might not make the same mistake???).
