Voltage scaling isn't the only component of CPU power management. Intels 
have supported low power states on idle since the Pentium 90 (Cyrix had 
"Suspend on HALT" earlier than that), which means that an idle processor 
takes less power than one executing code. On anything even vaguely 
modern, throttling will not save you any significant power compared to 
the C state support.

Have you got benchmark figures for this?
