Incorrect, because unless you explicitly enable the use of extents,
the mere act of using a new kernel such as might be found on knoppix
will not result in the filesystem utilizing the extent feature.
There's a lot FUD being spread by people who haven't been bothering to
understand what is being proposed, and that's disappointing.
