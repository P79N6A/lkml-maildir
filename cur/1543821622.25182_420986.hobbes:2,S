But, either the nsproxy is shared between tasks and you need to copy
youself a new one as soon as any ns changes, or it is not shared, and
you don't need  that info at all (just make the change in the nsproxy
immediately)
What am I missing?
Should we talk about this  on irc someplace?  Perhaps drag in Eric as
well?

That's true if we have one nsproxy per process or thread, which I didn't
think was the case.  Are you saying not to share nsproxy's among
processes which share all namespaces?

9 void*'s is probably more than we'll need, though, so it's not "the
beginning".   Eric previously mentioned uts, sysvipc, net, pid, and uid,
to which we might add proc, sysctl, and signals, though those are
probably just implied through the others.
What others do you see us needing?
If the number were more likely to be 50, then in the above experiment
use 50 instead - the point was to see the performance implications
without implementing the namespaces first.
Anyway I guess I'll go ahead and queue up some tests.
