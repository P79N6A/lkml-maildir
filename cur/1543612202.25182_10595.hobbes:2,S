Make that kB!
(page sizes is an implementation detail that depends on architecture, 
compilation options...)
(for Andrew:
 it multiplies with 1024 then divides by PAGE_SIZE, result is in pages.
 If you wanted to set no of pages then the scaling should be *1/1...
 earlier it only multiplied with 1024...)
