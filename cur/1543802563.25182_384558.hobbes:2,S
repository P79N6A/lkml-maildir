This runs a while loop at SCHED_FIFO prio 99?  And alarm never happens.
Doesn't the alarm get activated by the softirqd that is running at a
lower priority?  Seems that this is starving out the softirq from
getting the alarm.
I believe that Thomas once had priorities attached to the timers.  I'd
like to see that again, and may even start adding them myself, such that
when a process activates a timer, when that timer goes off, the softirq
will get the priority of the timer.  But this has some complications to
be sorted out.
