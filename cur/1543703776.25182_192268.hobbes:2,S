Yes, you're absolutely right.  You could just handle this by breaking
out of the loop (after processing one rcu) as soon as there's a
runnable rt task, independent of limit.

Well, you don't get to be a kernel hacker simply by looking good in
Speedos.

module_param() works for non-module code (it automatically inserts a
"rcu." prefix in the name though).

I think it's fair, though.  If you really absorb all your CPU with RT
tasks, you will starve important things: that's why RT is a root priv.

Personally I don't like overloading the semantic of CONFIG_PREEMPT.
But I think CONFIG_PREEMPT is a bad idea anyway: it's not really a
question you can ask a user during config.
CONFIG_LOW_LATENCY (Description: Sacrifice some raw performance to
increase latency) makes more sense, and would fit here, too.
Another option is to overload ksoftirq to do what krcud does: they're
v. similar in nature AFAICT.
Sorry I can't be more helpful 8)
