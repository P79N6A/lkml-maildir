At present, the partition checkers doesn't run, if one of the preceeding 
checker has reported an error ! *But*, some of the checkers doesn't 
report the I/O error which they came across! So, this may let others 
run. Thats not we want, right. We would like them to return I/O errors, 
and and the check_partition should let other partition checkers continue.
