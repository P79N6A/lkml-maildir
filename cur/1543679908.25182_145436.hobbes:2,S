Milton and I were just looking at this and it seems there is no locking
to prevent p->mm ending up NULL due to exit. And if p->mm does end up
NULL, you go off and kill all your kernel threads :)
Anton
	read_lock(&tasklist_lock);
	p = select_bad_process();
...
        oom_kill_task(p);
        /*
         * kill all processes that share the ->mm (i.e. all threads),
         * but are in a different thread group
         */
        do_each_thread(g, q)
                if (q->mm == p->mm && q->tgid != p->tgid)
                        oom_kill_task(q);
        while_each_thread(g, q);
