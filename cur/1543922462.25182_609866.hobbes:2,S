But we really *should* reserve things used by opregions, shouldn't
we?  After all, the whole point of resource reservation is to prevent
conflicts.
If these opregion resources aren't reserved, but are only put in the
ACPI resource_list, we will only find conflicts with drivers that use
acpi_check_resource_conflict().  Any driver unmodified by your changeset
could still have a conflict, and we'd never find it.
Isn't the real problem that we have a bunch of drivers that use some of
the same resources, and if ACPI reserved all the right resources, all
those drivers would break?
I think it would be better to:
  - Make ACPI reserve resources used by opregions unless
    acpi_enforce_resources == no.
  - Change the drivers so if their request_region() fails, they
    check acpi_enforce_resources and either fail (in strict mode)
    or print the warning and continue (in lax mode).
Admittedly, this is harder for the drivers that use the shiny new
platform device stuff.
