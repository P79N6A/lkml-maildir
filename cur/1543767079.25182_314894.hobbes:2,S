Hi,
Andrew stated a new mm version is pending.  This brings up a question.  With bk I would do
bk clone -ql -rv2.6.12-rc3 local-linux-2.6 2.6-rc3
cd 2.6-rc3
bk import -tpatch ../andrews-rc3-mmx-patch .
bk -r get -q
Given that I have a current git db of the kernel and up to date cogito tools, what do I do to
get a directory in the same state as above?
TIA,
Ed Tomlinson
