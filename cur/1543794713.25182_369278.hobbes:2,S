When looking in drivers/ieee1394/pcilynx.c, I noticed that there are a lot of spaces instead of tabs.
I prepared a patch to fix that.
file size of pcilynx.c before: 53775 bytes
file size after:                         42870 bytes
patch size is 85356 bytes.
Should I send this patch to the mailing list?
