b) doesn't seem to be an option either because (unlike
filemap.c:truncate_inode_pages()) we don't remove anything from the list
ourselves so we will be looping there forever starting from the head each
time. Unless someone knows of an easy way to discover that we *have*
slept or not.
More specifically:
some code;
put_user();
some other code that needs to know if put_user() above slept or not;
How?

Tigran.
