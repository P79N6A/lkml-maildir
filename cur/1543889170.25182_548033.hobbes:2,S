I'll post the patches tonight to see how it will look like.  Even though
I already posted the kernel-only patch which adjusts
raw1394_iso_packets32 per architecture, the 2x u64 variant may overall
be nicer:  a) it eliminates the need for raw1394_cycle_timer32,  b) the
get-cycle-timer ABI still has to be duplicated in Juju, and Juju so far
did not require different struct types for 32bit compatibility ioctls.
