[PATCH] I2C: Spare 1 byte in lm90 driver
I just noticed the other day that the lm90 driver uses an u16 to store
the value of the 8-bit alarms register. This is most probably due to the
fact that I originally copied the lm90 driver from the lm83 driver,
which actually has two 8-bit registers for alarms, and obviously forgot
to change the variable type.
