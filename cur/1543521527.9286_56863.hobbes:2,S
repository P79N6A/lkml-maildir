My reading of GPL is, that it requires you to ship the source to the
binaries that you ship. If you ship a RH 2.1 based system with 1.2.13
kernel with tons of custom patches, it requires you to ship the source
to this. Not the source to RH6.1 featuring 2.3.39pre1.
You seem to have misread the GPL. Your fault.
