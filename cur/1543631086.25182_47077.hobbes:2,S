Because the standard says either you return the errorcode and no data
is transferred or for a partial I/O you return how much was done. Its
not neccessarily about accuracy either. If you do a 4k copy_from_user and
error after for some reason returning -Esomething thats fine providing you
didnt do anything that consumed data or shifted the file position etc
