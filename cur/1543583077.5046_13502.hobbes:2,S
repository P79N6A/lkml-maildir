	Simple, our friends at No-name OEM Corporation ;) named that drive
"CDROM DRIVE 52X" in his ID string, a perfect OEM name that does not
involves any brand and looks good in windoze where the l/user see it in
system configuration as above.
	The hard reality is next, meaning the Linux driver determined "by
specific means" :) that the drive is at most "48X CD-ROM DRIVE w/128kb
buffer", THAT windozians will NOT see it.
	It happens a lot here in Romania also with crap chinese/taiwanese
drivers that doesn't carry any brand name and are bulk solded.
	Personally, I'll trust more a drive that say "Teac Corporation 32X"
than that no-name shit. IMMV.
