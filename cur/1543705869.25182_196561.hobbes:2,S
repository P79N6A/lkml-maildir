Yeah, I don't care as long as it works good :)

Yes, 1600MHz would be nice, I agree.
But I meant calculating all the valid values inbetween min and max without
relying on getting those values from the BIOS.
Then you would only need to find out the min and max values, and not
care about bugs in the BIOS table inbetween min and max.
I guess the code already does that to figure out how many steps are needed
to change between min and max?
