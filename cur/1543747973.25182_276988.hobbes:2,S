Just for reference, everything was working alright with GFP_ATOMIC. I 
thought the timer was not installed because ping would not detect the 
delay. This happened because ping writes to the ICMP packet the 
timestamp when it is first received by the kernel, before netfilter 
hooks. Using ping with the old behavior (ping -U) worked as expected, 
printing the time the packet was kept in my netfilter hook.
