I think the problem may have something to do with the size of the oops
information and how much is left on the screen.  I am doing Alpha
development here, and virtually every oops I get a) double oopses and b)
leaves no traces in dmesg or the log.  In this situation, the first oops
is long gone before I can even see it, and the second one is more than
half gone by the time it's done, which means what I see on the screen is
close to useless.  At present this is not a sufficiently critical issue
for us that we need to dive in and debug them, and when it becomes one I
suspect we'll wire up the serial line for a more persistent tracking
device (like a serial printer, a la Ingo's suggestion elsewhere on this
list).
Just my $.02, and only for a part of the issues Linus notes.
