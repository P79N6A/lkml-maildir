For those who are interested..
I have taken the kgdb patch for 2.4.0-test9 and ported it to 2.4.0.
This is a minimal patch, and doesn't include any of the documentation
or supporting programmes. It can be found at:
http://www.foursticks.com.au/~pschulz/kgdb

There is also a patch for 2.4.0-test12

kgdb is a patch to the linux kernel. It allows use of gdb for source level
debugging of a linux kernel. One can place breakpoints, step through code
and observe variables in the kernel similar to debugging a program.
For using kgdb you need two machines. One of these machines is the development
machine and the other is tests machine. The kernel to be debugged runs
on the tests machine. gdb runs on the development machine. The machines
are connected through a serial line. The serial line is used by gdb to
communicate to the kernel being debugged.
