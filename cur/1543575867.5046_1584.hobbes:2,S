ip_defrag is broken -- there is an obvious NULL pointer dereference
in it, introduced in test12. It doesn't hit normally, because of
path MTU discovery, but using NFS causes instant death.
I won't venture a fix, as I don't know the networking code well
enough. So far, no networking maintainer has had anything to say
about this bug on the list...
