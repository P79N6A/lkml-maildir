I would just mke the creator be special. The guy who creates the semaphore
owns it, and if he unmaps it, it's gone.
Note that there are other, potentially cleaner solutions. In particular,
some people like the "semaphore as file descriptor" approach, and I have
to say that I think they may be right. Then you just pass the file
descriptor along as the cookie, and you can do dup()/close() etc on it.
Mind trying that approach instead? It's not all that far off from your
current setup, and it would certainly have none of the security
implications..
