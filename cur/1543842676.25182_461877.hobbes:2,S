Looks all reasonable from a quick look.
I assume it will clash with the recent patch to remove wall_jiffies use,
but that should be easy to fix.
How does the performance of the user space gettimeofday look
compared to the old code in TSC mode?
BTW I got some experimental code to put clock_gettime into
user space too, but that can be later merged I guess.
