I'm trying to understand why you think they are needed at all. Except
for code that specifically does non-temporal we don't need fences on an
X86, and the code that uses non temporal stores has its own fences built
in.
So as far as I can see the only cases we ever have to care about are
PPro - processor bug
IDT Winchip - because we run it in oostore module not strict x86 mode
I don't see why you are generating extra fence instructions for other
cases
