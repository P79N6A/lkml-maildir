Subject: [rfc | patch 3/6] netpoll: change poll_napi to take a net_device
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/7/1/220

(sorry for munging the subject of the prior two patches)
The poll_napi routine is not specific to a netpoll.  It really should be
able to be called with a struct net_device.  Changing the routine to take a
struct net_device makes it easier to support the bonding driver, since we
will be implementing a netpoll_poll_dev routine, that will not have a
struct netpoll associated with it.
