Well, this is not the problem of daemonize(), but I agree, daemonize() should
die with the changes you proposed.

OK, I'll try to do "just for review" patch. I'm afraid pstree will be confused.

Yes! I thought about that too. but see below,

First, we still need some additional flag/parameter to set ->exit_state = -1.
Let's use CLONE_KERNEL_THREAD for discussion.
Now. Can we do copy_process(an_arbitrary_task) ? If yes, we need additional
locking in copy_process(). Just think about ->signal,->parent access. Nasty,
and probably not so useful.
If we can only use "current" or init_task, CLONE_KERNEL_THREAD is enough.
Just now it only
	- sets ->exit_state = -1
	- sets ->parent = &init_task
(note that the second change could be omitted, we can use CLONE_PARENT
 if we know that all users of CLONE_KERNEL_THREAD are kernel threads).

Yes, nice. This is not complete, we still have to wait for completion,
because kthread_create() promises that a new thread has no CPU on
return (so we can use kthread_bind() for example), but nice anyway.

Yes.
But note that CLONE_KERNEL_THREAD allows us to achieve the same step by
step. For example, we can extend the meaning of CLONE_KERNEL_THREAD to
use init_task.mm in copy_mm(), then copy_fs(), etc.
Eric, I am far from sure I am right though. Probably it is better to do
one big change as you suggested.
However, I like the idea of for-in-kernel-only CLONE_ flags. For example,
we can kill the ugly "pid" parameter of copy_process() and use CLONE_IDLE
instead.
Also, we can't use __kernel_thread() you propose if we want do_wait(),
using CLONE_ flags a bit more flexible.
BTW. I think your idea of kernel_thread_regs() is very nice in any case. Is
it enough (and possible) to implement an architecture neutral kernel_thread?
Oleg.
