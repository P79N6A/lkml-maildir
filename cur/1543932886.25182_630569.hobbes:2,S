I can't really answer either of these questions. All I know is the
problem exists, and we need to deal with it.
That's why the unreachable_devices() routine exists in the first place.
But that routine is limited to only the first 16 buses on segment-0.
You would like to think that hardware designers would confine legacy
hardware, or problematic hardware, to that area, but they don't.
As I said before, expanding that routine to cover more buses would
adversely impact mmconfig pci access, since the mmconfig access
code does a lookup of that bitmap for every request. I don't think
we want that bitmap and the accompanying in-line lookup to increase
enough to encompass the pci configuration of some of these larger
systems.

Appended below is a code snippet embedded in the RHEL version of mmconfig.c,
for both i386 and x86_64. It does not encompass all the systems that have
(or will have) problems with mmconf. Only HP platforms are listed, but I
believe there are others.
The reason the HP platforms got caught is they put these devices beyond
bus 16, where they would have been trapped, and the problem would have
been avoided.

I have talked to intel about this, but they haven't gotten back to me.
All I know at this point is that a mmconf write to the BAR at offset 0x18
of this device hangs the system.
