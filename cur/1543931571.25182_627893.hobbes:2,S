Ah, thanks, so it is. Well, doing an `rmmod bcm43xx ; modprobe ssb
b43` gives me nothing in dmesg other than lines related to the bcm43xx
driver. iwconfig/ifconfig do not see the interface either.

Okay, I had to modprobe rfkill-input and rfkill by hand, didn't
realize that. Hopefully that'll be automatic soon. Regardless, upon
doing so, and loading ssb and b43, it sees my card, but is still not
fully functional. iwconfig sees:
lo        no wireless extensions.
eth0      no wireless extensions.
tun0      no wireless extensions.
eth1      no wireless extensions.
wlan0_rename  IEEE 802.11g  ESSID:""
          Mode:Managed  Channel:0  Access Point: Not-Associated
          Tx-Power=0 dBm
          Retry min limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr=2346 B
          Link Quality:0  Signal level:0  Noise level:0
          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0
          Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:0   Missed beacon:0
(eth0 is ethernet, eth1 doesn't exist -- usually it's the wireless.)
`ifconfig` doesn't see eth1 or wlan0_rename.
What else might I be doing wrong? Regardless, perhaps scheduling
bcm43xx for removal in 2.6.26 is a bit premature.
