The algorithms of the kernel can all be found in the
kernel source code, which is available at ftp.kernel.org.
There are a number of books available on the Linux kernel
design, check out your favorite online bookstore to
find those.
Algorithms for designing the kernel (for doing the
actual design and stuff) vary from developer to developer,
but most seem to involve staring, deep thought and lots
of caffeine. The "graduate student algorithm" should
prove a sufficiently close approximation :)

Rik
