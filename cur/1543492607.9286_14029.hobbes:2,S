Hi,
I forgot to add that although /proc/kcore_elf is still a very good idea -
I have recently discovered another alternative that works fine under
Linux (and several other flavours of UNIX) - KME.
The URL is:
http://robertl.freeservers.com/kme/
It is a Kernel Memory Editor that allows you to browse kernel data
structures in real-time and even modify them. Supports structures (though
you need to teach it via pstruct).
Regards,
