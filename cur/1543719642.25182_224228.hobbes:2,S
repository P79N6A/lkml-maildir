What format do you propose?  I don't care too much.
Maintenance would get easier with less recursions, obviously. ;)
I could hack up something that will generate digests from the function
source code (through smatch or so) and put those digests into the
comments.  As long as they match, the comments remain valid.  And that
should get past lawyers, as I work on a different basis now.

things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data
