Then put the URL's in the FAQ and be done with it.  
I can assure you that the first time the CVS gateway has a problem it
won't come back until you have stopped being rude.  You do understand
that the SVN and RSYNC data come from the CVS gateway and that the
CVS gateway comes from BitMover and that all of this crap is hosted by
BitMover, right?  {cvs,svn}.kernel.org are cnames for kernel.bkbits.net.
Here's a suggested replacement signature, it accomplishes your goal of
advertising the services.  Why this needs to be here and not in the FAQ
is beyond me.
