You recall incorrectly.
The code is old.
There is very little reason for it, and we could change today.
In fact I think I once submitted the corresponding patch.
My machines regularly see 6- or 7-digit PIDs.
There are two very minor points:
(i) If you are in the habit of tar'ing up /proc, and moreover the
tar you use considers files with the same device and inode to be
identical, then your tarfiles may become smaller after the patch
-#define fake_ino(pid,ino) (((pid)<<16)|(ino))
+#define fake_ino(pid,ino) (((1)<<16)|(ino))
in fs/proc/base.c.
(ii) There is also a rather obscure place in SYSV IPC where a 16-bit pid_t
is used for the fields msg_lspid and msg_lrpid of the (obsolete)
struct msqid_ds and the fields shm_cpid and shm_lpid of the (obsolete)
struct shmid_ds. Nothing compiled today uses this, and almost nothing
uses it at all, but this nevertheless means that one needs an option
CONFIG_15BIT_PID (default=N) for backward binary compatibility.

[The patch is available. There are a few security advantages.
Also, it makes a fork a just measurable fraction of a percent faster.]
