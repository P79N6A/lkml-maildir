the problem is one of noise, while it is sometimes useful to see these
messages (back when I was a PC tech working on windows systems I kept a
set of slackware disks handy to boot from and see what hardware was really
installed in the machines before hunting for the windows drivers) we are
also getting to a point where so many things are flashing by on the screen
that it's very hard to see them (especially with todays nice fast
machines).
it's like network Intrusion Detection systems, a lot of people install
them and gain no value from them becouse they send out so many alerts that
they get ignored.
I definantly don't want the verbose mode to go away, but it may be time to
make the default be the quiet mode that only prints actual errors instead
of the current verbosity.
