The mastodon's (aka mammoths ;) may make a batch of several related
changes to the cpuset configuration.  What's important is that the
locusts see either none or all of the changes in a given batch, not
some intermediate inconsistent state, and that the locusts see the
change batches in the same order they were applied.
Off the top of my head, I doubt I care when the locusts see the
changes.  Some delay is ok, if that's your question.
But don't try too hard to fit any work you do to cpusets.  For now,
I don't plan to mess with cpuset locking anytime soon.  And when I
do next, it might be that all I need to do is to change the quick
lock held by the locusts from a mutex to an ordinary rwsem, so that
multiple readers (locusts) can access the cpuset configuration in
parallel.
