I wrote a little app which simulates a text editor writing out
its buffer.  Just:
struct line {
	char *data;
	int length;
	struct line *next;
};
walk this linked list, writing the lines out.  The input was
`cat linux/kernel/*.c > inputfile' and the output was written
1000 times (300 megs).  Benched four different ways of writing the
output:
                    2.5.34         2.5.34-mm2         2.5.34-mm2-taka
write                 54s             54s                   55s
fwrite                12.8s          12.8s                 12.7s
fwrite_unlocked       11.6s          11.6s                 11.5s
writev                39s            33.4s                 15.8s
So Janet's patch made a 15% improvement with this test.  Yours
dropped it 50% again.

O_SYNC writev?  Ooh, oww, that hurts...
With 2.5.34, writing the 300k file once (1000x less data than above)
with 1024-vector writev's, opened O_SYNC:  68 seconds.
With 2.5.34-mm2-taka the same write takes 0.23 seconds.  (I had to write
100x as much data just to get a measurement).
A 300x speedup is nice, but based on these numbers syslogd should be
using fwrite_unlocked() and fflush().
O_SYNC should be eradicated.  It's basically always the wrong thing
to do.  Applications should write as much stuff as they can and then
run fsync.

Great.  The test app is at
