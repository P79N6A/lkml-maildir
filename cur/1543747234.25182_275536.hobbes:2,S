Usually driver hangs during resume or shortly after that. Things like
"failed to initialize hardware and driver not robust enough to deal
with hardware being gone". I've not yet seen scribbling over memory
(and hopefully it stays that way :-).
Oh btw those alsa problems were fixed, IIRC: I think it was "not
restoring PCI config space correctly".
