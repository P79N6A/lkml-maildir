But that's not the way things currently are.

Basically everything under block layer.

If the way forward is to make anything but the low level drivers not
care about sglist, in the long term, the current scheme is fine but I
still don't think this way of doing things is safe one.  We're affecting
large portion of code based on what things should be in future not what
they currently are.

I think this is where the difference comes from.  To me it seems
internal usage seems more wide-spread and more delicate and not too many
care about the true size and when they do only in well defined places.
Maybe it comes from the difference between your most and my most.
Thanks.
