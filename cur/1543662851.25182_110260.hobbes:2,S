Yup. At least right now. And we do tend to hold tasklist_lock in most
cases simply by virtue of having to get it anyway in order to search for 
the process.

Agreed.  That, and the fact that most of the time the stuff _is_ there:  
obviously any time the process looks at its own signals it will always be
there.
So we have two cases:
 - "normal" signal sending which holds tasklist_lock to find the target.
 - signals to the process itself, which is usually safe, since we know 
   we're there (the exception would be if/when taking a fault in the exit
   path, but even that might be ok since signals are torn down not by exit
   itself but by "release_task")
So the signal path may actually be ok.
