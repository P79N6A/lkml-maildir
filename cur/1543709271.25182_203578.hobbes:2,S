Your driver is buggy.  It's not surprising since you fundamentally
don't understand the kernel interface you're trying to use.

When did it change?  Show me a kernel version where poll_wait() waited
until the driver woke it up.  (Kernel versions at least as far back as
1.0 are readily available from kernel.org, so it should be easy for
you)
