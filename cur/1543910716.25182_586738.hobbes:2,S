Well, in this case the "box" I want to secure will eventually be  
running multi-user X on a multi-level-with-IPsec network.  For that  
kind of protection profile, there is presently no substitute for  
SELinux with some X11 patches.  AppArmor certainly doesn't meet the  
confidentiality requirements (no data labelling), and SMACK has no  
way of doing the very tight per-syscall security requirements we have  
to meet.  I didn't make this clear initially but that is the kind of  
system I'm talking about wanting to secure some 50 million lines of  
code on.

Well, for some of the systems we distribute, "all the MCS extensions  
plus all the LSPP work" is nowhere near enough security; we need full- 
fledged multi-level-security, role-based-access-control, and specific  
per-daemon MAC restrictions.
