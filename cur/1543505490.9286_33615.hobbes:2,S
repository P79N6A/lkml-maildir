I usually don't chime in with "me too" messages, but my tulip card is
the interface for my @home cable modem and I've not seen a problem.  It
provides ip masquerading for a network of four Win 95/98 machines, and a
LOT of traffic goes through that card.  It even shares IRQ 11 with
another card  with no problem.
