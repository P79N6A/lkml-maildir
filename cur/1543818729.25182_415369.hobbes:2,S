Hi Linus,
I'd love to come up with another way to do it, but this still comes
back as the cleanest to me :( I've tried to limit the damage based on
your comments.

Added - I am not sure how this will affect Carsten's situation based
on the further discussion in this thread, however if something changes
at that point I assume we can modify the limitation at a later stage.

Good catch! I think it goes back to when the mspec driver abused the
nopage interface. The previous version was passing `ret' to the driver
as well as looking at the pfn return value. I don't think the driver
should modify `ret' directly, so I have changed it to use two specific
pfn error values (NOPFN_OOM and NOPFN_SIGBUS), similar to how the
nopage handler works. I think the original intention was to catch all
potential errors a driver could stick in, but thinking about it again
I don't think it makes sense to try that.
Anyway, I hope you like this version of the nopfn code better! Update
version of the mspec driver to match it will follow in a minute.
Cheers,
Jes
Implement do_no_pfn() for handling mapping of memory without a struct
page backing it. This avoids creating fake page table entries for
regions which are not backed by real memory.
This version uses specific NOPFN_{SIGBUS,OOM} return values, rather
than expect all negative pfn values would be an error. It also bugs on
cow mappings as this would not work with the VM.
