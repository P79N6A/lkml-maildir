I have not tried this, but specifying the include path relative to the
directory where the .c file is placed should do the trick.
So if you have:
comedi/
include/
And execute "make -C ...." within the comedi/ directory, the statement:
EXTRA_CFLAGS := -I$(obj)/../include
in the Makefile should do the trick.

But I'm not - getting these:
Subject: Your message to comedi awaits moderator approval
My point was not to cc: the comedi ML, since potential repliers (like me)
get these kind of replies.
