sure, was tripping over that anyways ... since the compiler spits out tons
of "conversion without a cast" warnings (seems to be a different way to 
use grep :)
i just came across one problem: when converting the unsigned longs to
        void * pointers, everything works fine, beside the "advanced"
        pointer arithmetic. (like aligning the address to a certain 
        boundary - using address & MASK) ... for that case i need to
        cast to an unsigned long in any case :( 
                is there another way to do it without explicit casting?
		should we introduce ptr_addr_t?
		can we be sure that an unsigned long is capable to hold
			and address (also in the future)
		can we be sure about gcc void * pointer arithmetic (like
			++ incremets the address by one)

in some way i do, and in some way i don't.
