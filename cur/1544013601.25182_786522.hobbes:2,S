OK, let's see.

It seems you meant "If you have enough space ... for stress testing
natively, you _MUST ALSO_ do the same with building perl  _TO JUST_
negate point #2". From this point of view your further arguments are
obvious.

So you put a constraint on environment to build kernel. Not on a
specific version of shell or gcc. But require SANE environment in
rhetoric sence. In the absence of clear specification of sane
environment it _IS_ an issue. Or simply: "sane" now reads "perlful
enough"?

The rationale of changes being proposed is to keep people able to make
their choice on how to build and use their environment. If the code,
which now has to be generated by perl scripts, was shipped with
linux*.tar.bz2, I'd nullify the majority of my objections. Please, DO
NOT require this code to be BUILT, and many would again be happy. You
see, the total question is then reduces to some changes in makefiles
(eliminating FORCE prerequisites).
Otherwise you just force the number of people to invent and maintain
"regress" patches, which is counter-progressive in all sences.
