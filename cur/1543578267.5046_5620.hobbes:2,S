Hi!
On 
http://www.escape.de/users/outback/linux/patch-2.4.0-mk1
 you find a
small patch that allows to use a cramfs image as initrd. Notes:
Use ramdisk_blocksize=4096 as Linus suggested a few days ago.
The patch modifies mkcramfs to write the fs size into the superblock. So
you have to make a new image with mkcramfs; old images won't work. This
fs size now is used in identify_ramdisk_image() in rd.c
Also note that cramfs.h has been renamed and moved to
include/linux/cramfs_fs.h (needs cleanup).
Have fun,
	Kili
