That's pretty nice.
Back when I was writing [the now slated for death] 
sound/oss/via82xxx_audio.c driver, Linus suggested that I implement 
->nopage() for accessing the mmap'able DMA'd audio buffers, rather than 
using remap_pfn_range().  It worked out very nicely, because it allowed 
the sound driver to retrieve $N pages for the mmap'able buffer (passed 
as an s/g list to the hardware) rather than requiring a single humongous 
buffer returned by pci_alloc_consistent().
And although probably not your primary motivation, your change does IMO 
improve this area of the kernel.
