The one restriction we are imposing is that SIGINT, SIGTERM etc will not
currently kill containter-inits. Only SIGKILL will.  But that is good point.
Maybe we should document that as a limitation we may remove in the future ? 
i.e. Its not a feature that container-inits should rely on.  Like sysV init,
container-init should still SIG_IGN all unhandled signals. If they don't,
they may break in the future.

Yes, I believe we can say that SIGKILL/SIGSTOP from parent are always
delivered and no fatal signal from same ns is.

Yes, you have a point. It started out as an optimization, but unwanted
signals are either ignored or dropped _always_ (or we have a bug).

The user-semantics appear to be clean now.
