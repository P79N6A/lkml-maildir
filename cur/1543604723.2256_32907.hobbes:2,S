It's still not entirely unlikely that doing VM mappings is simply more
expensive than just doing a memcpy. The TLB invalidate is only part of the
issue - you also have the page table walk, the VM lock, and the fact that
PAGE_COPY itself ends up being overhead.
Which is why the PAGE_COPY kind of read() optimization is _probably_ only
worth it if the user asks for it directly (or automatically only for large
reads together with single-threaded applications).
The explicit flag is probably a good idea also because of usage patterns
(PAGE_COPY is a slowdown _if_ the file is actually written to or even
mapped shared).
