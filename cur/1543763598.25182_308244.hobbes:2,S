Hi!
I'm currently developing a small OS. But I have some questions towards 
the boot sequence:
Grub (0.9.6) is installed in the MBR of the Harddisk (512 Byte - Stage 
1) than grub loads Stage 2 which is located at a fixed address 
(specified in stage1.h), but how is this location linked to an inode and 
marked as used (e.g. in the ext2/3 bitmap)? And doesn't it conflict with 
the file system? And how can I instruct grub to load a file from a not 
specified location which is maybe splited without updating it every time 
the location changes?
Maybe there are some documents which include the answers to my questions 
and some additional information.
Thanks
Matthias-Christian Ott
