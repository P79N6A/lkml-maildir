Just too bad this is a typical single-user-only mechanism: I don't want the
same icons (or messages, or whatever) to apply to make(1) as the next
guy. It is a UI problem, and UIs are user setup configuration stuff, not
file format stuff.
If you can come up with something that currently isn't kept in an
executable (or whatever) file, and that has to be managed centrally, it is
probably something that has to be kept out of the file itself anyway: ACLs
and capabilities are cases in point.
