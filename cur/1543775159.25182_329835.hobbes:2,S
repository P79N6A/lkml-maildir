Sure it is a possibility.
I don't think you could call it effective like a completely
lockless version is effective. You might take more locks during
gang lookups, you may have a lot of ugly and not-always-working
heuristics (hey, my app goes really fast if it spreads accesses
over a 1GB file, but falls on its face with a 10MB one). You
might get increased cache footprints for common operations.
I mainly did the patches for a bit of fun rather than to address
a particular problem with a real workload and as such I won't be
pushing to get them in the kernel for the time being.
