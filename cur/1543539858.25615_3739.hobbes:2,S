do you mean that i think block #X starts on sector #Y, when it realy starts on sector #Z,
but any request regrading  sector  #Y will be  mapped transparently to sector #Z by the
SCSI controler or someone ?
if so i should not realy care as long as i'm interfcing with the SCSI controler, and not
trying to read the drive using my own read/write head.
