OK, looking at the numbers we have just one time-jump:

The "Detected 1400.279 MHz processor." line just happens to be written
_during_ time_init, when use_tsc is already set, but cycles_2_ns is not
yet initialized.
So I think everything is well-understood. It's just a matter of whether 
it's worth fixing.
