the API is a bit crooked right now; you have 2 timespecs as a measure of
time, and you return a long as diff, rather than another timespec.
How do you know the nsec_t doesn't overflow ??? I suspect the answer is
"you don't". timespec's are a way to deal with that nicely. And it makes
the API more symmetric as well
