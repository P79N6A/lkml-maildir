Hi all,
I have not understood how the common kernel stack in the
init_thread_union(2.6 ,init_task_union in case of 2.4) works for all
the processes which run on the same processor. The scheduling is round
robin and yet the things on the stack (saved during SAVE_ALL) have to
be maintained after a switch without them getting erased. I am
familiar with only the i386 arch implementation.
Please help
regards,
Suthambhara
