US copyright law isn't the only one in the world...

German copyright law explicitely allows every person allowed to use a 
program to observe and test this program for getting the ideas behind 
the program as long as you can do this through normal usage of the 
program.
If you aren't building a similar program but require disassembling for 
interoperability, this is explicitely allowded.
According to German copyright law, any licence clauses that violate 
these rules are void [1].
Note that German copyright lay doesn't differentiate whether you paid 
or not - it only requires that you allowed to use the program.

These are paragraphs 69d(3), 69e and 69g(2) of German copyright law - 
IANAL, but the text of the law is pretty unambiguous.

[1] the clauses are void, not the licence itself
