We want to make NFS share superblocks on a per-filesystem basis, rather
than forcing it into a per-server basis. Cachefs may like the latter,
but POSIX does not like a filesystem where inode numbers are not
guaranteed to be unique.
A unique per-server superblock also makes it hard to support features
like failover onto replicated filesystems and/or migration of individual
filesystems onto another server.
Cheers,
