Yes, it would be better to have a per-drive (or hwif) extra limiting
factor if it is needed. For this case it really isn't, so probably not
the best idea :)

It's just a questions of maintaining the proper request state so you
know how much and what part of a request is pending. Requests have been
handled this way ever since clustered requests, that is why
current_nr_sectors differs from nr_sectors. And with hard_* duplicates,
it's pretty easy to extend this a bit. I don't see this as something
complex, and if the alternative you are suggesting (your implementation
idea is not clear to me...) is to fork another request then I think it's
a lot better.
Say you receive a request that violates the magic sector count rule. You
decide to do the first half of the request, and setup your taskfile for
that. You can diminish nr_sectors appropriately, or you can keep this
sector count in the associated taskfile - whatever you prefer. The
end_io path that covers both "normal" and partial IO is basically:
	if (!end_that_request_first(rq, 1, sectors))
		rq is done
	else
		rq state is now correctly the 2nd half
In the not-done case, you simply fall out of your isr as you would a
complete request, and let your request_fn just start it again. You don't
even know this request has already been processed.
Depending on whether you remove the request from the queue or not, you
just push the request to the top of the request queue so you are certain
that you start this one next.
So there's really nothing special about partial completions, rather full
completions are a one-shot partial completion :)

My gut would say rather two 64kb than a 124 and 4kb. But you should do
the numbers, of course :). I'd be surprised if the former wouldn't be
more efficient.
