Hi John,
	I did what you told me to do. I disabled ACPI PM time source. There is a 
significant change. The system clock is running still too fast but it is a 
very small difference. After 24 hours the difference is 2 minutes ahead. I 
don't know what to think about it. Is it precise enough or should I do some 
more tests. As far as I remember the system clock on this machine was runnig 
perfectly fine so that even after one week it was still in sync with other 
electronic clocks I have. I think I'll try to disable CPUfreq and see if it 
helps. 
Thanks for helping out,
	Mariusz
