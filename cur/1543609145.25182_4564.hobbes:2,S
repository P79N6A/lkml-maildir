Terrific! I can't say what an incredible help and relief it is to have
independent verification, and of course, another set of watchful eyes
to help you catch your small mistakes. Thanks again!

Running with the APICs does require reserving some memory, though often
it seems to come out of what's already reserved, resulting in multiple
reservation messages (in the stock bootmem too).

I don't want to wear you out as a tester. =) Probably the testing most
needed, though, is testing on all the different supported architectures.
Of course, it won't hurt, either.
I've got independent verification on i386, and have verified myself on
IA64. I should roll a fresh patch and call for testers this weekend.
Cheers,
Bill
