Hi,
I recently reported several oopses that occurred after I had upgraded
from 2.0.35 to 2.0.36. I switched back to 2.0.35, and the problems are
gone. So I really suppose it really has something to do with 2.0.36. One
strange thing I noticed after 35->36 is something like this in the
syslogs:
Dec 13 04:22:59 osiris mountd[292]: access from host 127.0.0.1 rejected 
Dec 13 04:23:11 osiris last message repeated 2 times
This repeats very often (no such thing with 2.0.35, neither before 
upgrading 35->36 nor after switching back). I heard from at least one 
other sysadmin having the same messages in his logs. One thing he and 
me have in common is that we both use the automounter (as for me, I use
920824upl102 from amd-920824upl102-10.i386.rpm, RedHat). Might it be 
possible the the automounter triggers a bug in 2.0.36?
Regards
