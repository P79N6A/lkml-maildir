I've been trying to write a driver for the OnStream 50GB tape drives. I've
got it done in userland with SG, but am trying to move it into a kernel
driver, and trawling through the SCSI mid layer is getting me nowhere.
Should I maybe wait for a tidy up of the mid layer before continuing work
on the driver, or would I be waiting indefinately for that to happen?
Thanks.
Terry.
