Umm...  You know, the most obvious system call that should care about
read-only is open(pathname, O_RDWR) ;-)  IOW, taking care of directory
modifications is not enough - you need to deal with
	* opening file for write
	* truncation (both from *truncate() and from open() with O_TRUNC)
	* metadata changes (timestamps, ownership, permissions)
But yes, it's not that far from where we should eventualy get.
