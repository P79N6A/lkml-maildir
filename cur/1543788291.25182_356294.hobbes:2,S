memory, Whole compilation gose well but at the last step
make install I am getting a warning
WARNING: No module mptbase found for kernel 2.6.13, continuing anyway
WARNING: No module mptscsih found for kernel 2.6.13, continuing anyway
now when I boot my kernel, panic is received
Booting the kernel.
Red Hat nash version 4.1.18 starting
mkrootdev: lable / not found
mount: error 2 mounting ext3
mount: error 2 mounting none
switchroot: mount failed : 22
umount : /initrd/dev failed : 22

What could be the problem?
I have RHEL 4 base release already installed on which I have compiled
