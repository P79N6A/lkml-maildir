if fireing up one program (however minor) can cause network performance to drop 
by >50% (based on the numbers reported earlier in this thread) that is a 
significant problem for sysadmins.
yes tcpdump may be wrong in requesting timestamps (in most cases it probably is, 
but in some cases it's doing exactly what the sysadmin wants it to do), but I 
don't think that many sysadmins would expect this much of a performance hit. 
there should be some way to tell the system to ignore requests for timestamps so 
that a badly behaved program cannot cripple the system this way (and preferably 
something that doesn't require a full SELinux/capabilities implementation)
