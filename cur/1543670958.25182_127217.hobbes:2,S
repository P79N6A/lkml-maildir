Pick any number and it will be either too loud or below the fan noise
for some users, maybe both. The only number that has the same effect
for all users happens to be the number I personally would prefer as a
default and the alsa people have chosen.
What is wrong with 0? Even aunt tilly will figure out what the deal
it and it depends on the distribution if she can find the right
solution for this.
