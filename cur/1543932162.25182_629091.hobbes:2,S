No, that isn't useful. Only a write is "guaranteed" to make ISA/LPC meaning 
the timing for a read varies wildly. See the in/out cycles results posted 
earlier. Was also reading the Intel PIIX(3) chiset datasheet today which 
specifically mentions that only writes flow through to ISA, reads do not.
