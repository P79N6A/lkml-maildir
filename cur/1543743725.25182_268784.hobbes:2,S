all allocations should have a failure path to avoid deadlocks. But in
the meantime __GFP_REPEAT is at least localizing the problematic places ;)

probably it should because this is also a case where no fail path exists.
My point was only that when a fail path exists, it's more reliable not
to invoke the oom killer and let userspace handle the failure.
