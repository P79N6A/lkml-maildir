Makes the geode code appear to be called, and nothing is broken so
far.  Minimal testing so far actually seems to indicate a slight
performance improvement.  And /proc/cpuinfo no longer shows Unknown
model.  I am pretty sure in the past I have seen the model name show
MediaGX, so I suspect sometime in the last year there was a revision
change or something in the cpu modules we are using, since it now shows
Unknown.

This BIOS has no ACPI.  At best it could do APM.
Seems the amd site requires an NDA to get at anything useful.  Maybe I
looked in the wrong place.
