No can do.
Aliasing in gcc is so broken (_purely_ type-based and no way to avoid it
sanely in older versions) that it's not going to happen.
When we can depend on everybody having gcc-3.3+ something, and that one
properly supports the "may_alias" attribute, we may change that.
"restrict" is pretty much useless. It just weakens the already too-weak
alias rules of standard gcc.
