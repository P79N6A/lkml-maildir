bzzt.
oh but it IS a standard SCSI feature.  unit serial number is part of the
VPD page 80h.
Multipathing software for FC HBAs have made use of this for quite a
while now.
(ok, we're quibbling here - its OPTIONAL for a device to support this -
but i can go back ~7 years of SCSI/FC devices i have here and all
devices i've found do return this...).
cheers,
lincoln.
