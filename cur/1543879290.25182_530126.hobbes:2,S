It's not a fork, actually. Ian Molton started battery stuff years before
David's work.
Though ours and David's exported API functions are exactly the same
(don't count functions which are unique for our code), but our
implementation a little intersects with David's.
For me it was no matter if I'll take handhelds.org or David's code as a
start point, except that hh.o code familiar to me, and I can test it on
real devices.
Though, you're right, we're in situation when we've two battery classes
now. :-/ And another pity fact is that we also have 8 Mb of patches in
our CVS. It takes a lot of time to to cleanup code for mainline,
especially with limited man-power resources. But we're working hard.
So, this is brief explanation why it took so long for us to show up.

I'm not sure if it's possible to create that type of conditional
attribute group. Because the condition is "bat->func != NULL", not
attribute' function. And that condition is battery-specific, not class
specific.
But anyway, I guess you're talking about not yet existent API, so I'd be
glad to take a look.
