For what we are trying to solve, which is blocking userspace config
accesses, I don't think we do. Greg - are you ok with this?

I thought about that when coding this up and thought it would
be better to simply have the function do what it advertises and no
more. Seems strange that a function called pci_block_config_access
would go and do a bunch of pci config accesses, but we can
certainly add it if you like.
