Okey. Now I know, thanks. I assumed that it was either this or that it had
to follow the standard procedure of posting the mach-patch(/patchset) a
hundred times to lkml before it got accepted.
(And regarding the distros: They distributors could just rip that part out
while doing all their patches ;). And I know that at least mandrake has a
positive look on xbox-distro. And the mandrake devels were especially
helpful in porting their installer to be compatible with the xbox.)
Just to make clear: The patch does nothing that involves anything with the
copy-protection. Not even the hdd-unlock. It is aimed to those who replace
the bios in the xbox with the clean microsoft-free cromwell-bios, which has
the sole purpose of booting linux.
