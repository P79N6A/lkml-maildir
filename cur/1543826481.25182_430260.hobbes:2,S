Subject: [patch-rt 0/2] Initial ARM generic-timeofday support

Hi,
This patchset (against -rt26, but should apply to newer patch) adds
initial support for generic TOD on ARM. It is fairly simple and
copletely rips out the existing TOD code in ARM, assuming that each
sub-arch will either provide a clocksource or enable CONFIG_IS_TICK_BASED.
Currently only Versatile is supported.
Please apply so folks can start testing or provide comments.
Tnx,
~Deepak
