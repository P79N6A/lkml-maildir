would you mind to elaborate the precise race? I cannot see how the above
sequence could crash on current 2.6:
del_timer_sync() takes the base pointer in timer->base and locks it, then
checks whether the timer has this base or not and repeats the sequence if
not. add_timer() locks the current CPU's base, then installs the timer and
sets timer->base. Where's the race?
