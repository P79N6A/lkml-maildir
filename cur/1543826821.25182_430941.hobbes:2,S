very close to the end of the file:
  alternatives_smp_module_add(NULL, "core kernel",
                              __smp_locks, __smp_locks_end,
                              _text, _etext);
The core kernel is just a "special" module (where we keep track of the
.text section boundaries too), and LOCKs outside the _text -> _etext
range are never ever patched.
cheers,
  Gerd
