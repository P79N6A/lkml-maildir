yes, we can drop serial bits from early_printk.c, and use
drivers/serial/8250_early.c and
with "earlycon=uart,io,0x3f8,9600n8", "early=ueart,mmio,0xfe000000,9600n8"
and we can extend other non 8250 compatitable uart to some *_early.c
in the same dir.
So other platform and other uart could be happy to get early console.
