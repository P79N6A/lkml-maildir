Exactly. I think Christoph is comparing it to the original md
architecture thich was more of an evolutionary design on the existing
block layer - it is merely an artifact of this that intermediary
devices were present (and consuming minors) - in a well architected
volume manager, this is not necessary or desirable - not presenting
the intermediary devices is IMHO also a saftey feature preventing
access to devices that shouldn't be accessed.

Yes, considering the abstraction (and the futureproofing this provides),
it would not make sense to bind these logical nodes to the orthogonal
block layer - which would probably also make maintenance more complex
in the future. I guess one of the advantages of the EVMS approach
is the ability for the core code to fit more easily with less changes
into kernels with differing block layers (2.4,2.5,future).
