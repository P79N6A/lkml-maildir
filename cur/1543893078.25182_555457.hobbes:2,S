hi all
i am bit confused with the function defination of inet_listen.
How a listen socket can listen and return to application at a time.
since a server stops at accpet not at listen then how listening port start.
I was thinking that the listen call thread out at the tcp_v4_hash
function time but it actaully does not use any thread fucntion and
simple return so how does the listening socket start.
thanks
TEJ
