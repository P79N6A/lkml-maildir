Subject: SLUB: kmem_cache_destroy doesn't

I tried out SLOB in latest mm.
raid5 uses kmem_cache_create to create a cache, a deletes it with
kmem_cache_destroy.
After I change the name for the slab to not include a '/' the create
worked fine, but the destroy seems incomplete.
If I stop an array and restart it, the second kmem_cache_create fails
because it thinks the name is already in use.
If I look in sysfs, I can see it there.
And 
  # cat /sys/slab/raid5-md1/aliases
  -1
is a bit suspicious.
And
void kmem_cache_destroy(struct kmem_cache *s)
{
	down_write(&slub_lock);
	if (s->refcount)
		s->refcount--;
	else {
		list_del(&s->list);
		WARN_ON(kmem_cache_close(s));
		sysfs_slab_remove(s);
		kfree(s);
	}
	up_write(&slub_lock);
}
looks a bit odd.
I would have thought the test should be:
        if (s->refcount > 1)
??
(2.6.21-rc6-mm1 to be precise)
