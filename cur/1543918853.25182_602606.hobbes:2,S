I'm trying to say "text size *and* config option is not set". That
have nothing to do with other text size reductions.

If it is so important for major kernel developer like you, Ingo, then
why there's no scrollback at first place? Why nothing like that was
not implemented up until now?   
My first ever Linux hack was changing default console output color. I
think it was seven years ago. I though, it was not serious, if nobody
did that already (in the 2.2.14).
Please, don't mix important stuff here. I know, what kernel console is.

I'd say: towards hard OOPs-handling developer.

I added comment (like this), so anyone can skip reading body, if headers
are "Oleg Verych && NAK". In case if `NAK' have a magic meaning in the
LKML, like control characters in the tty, i'm sorry.
But how to express opinion quickly and easily?
