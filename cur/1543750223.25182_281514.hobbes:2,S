let me assure you that III) does neither break the existing code
nor reduce security, for the following reasons:
  a) the per process capability is a requirement for
     _all_ subcapabilities (when the cap is in the cap_mask)
  b) the capability system isn't changed for caps not
     in the cap_mask
  c) reducing a cap by removing a subcapability can only
     increase security not lower it

to some extend, yes ...

I consider the 'magically' part another solution I didn't
list in my previous mail, but it is a kind of variation
from II) where we do not necessarily need subcaps for _all_
aspects of a capability (as a matter of fact it's one less)

I guess it might be doable, although the 'magically' part
would require to keep masks for all caps which got split
to select the corresponding sub-capabilities ...
