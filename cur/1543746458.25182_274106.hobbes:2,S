Subject: Delay in unmounting a USB pen drive

SuSE kernel 2.6.5:
My USB pen drive has a vfat FS. When i transfer some files & try to
unmount the drive ( umount /mnt ) , the command appears hung. CTRL+C also
does not work. Only later did i realise that it was actually taking a
longer time ( 10 - 15 sec )
to unmount.
My questions are:
- Why is it taking a long time to unmount ?
- Is it safe to remove the pen drive from it's slot when the umount is still in
  progress ?? ( I tried this the first time & maybe lucky me, the
files copied were fine )
TIA
