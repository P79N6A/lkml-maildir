Subject: [PATCH] Fix cryptoapi deflate not handling PAGE_SIZE chunks.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi Herbert.
Here's a resend of a patch I'm using in Suspend2's new cryptoapi
support, which is needed for us to successfully compress pages using
deflate. It's along the lines of the existing fix in the decompression
code.
Regards,
Nigel

Evolution.
Enumerate the requirements.
Consider the interdependencies.
Calculate the probabilities.
Be amazed that people believe it happened.
