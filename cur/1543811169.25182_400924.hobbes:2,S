Our "2.6 forever" policy is why we're stuck with this approach. We tried 
alternative implementations in -mm for a while but like all alternatives they 
need truckloads more testing to see if they provide a real advantage and 
don't cause any regressions. This made it impossible to seriously consider 
any alternatives.
I hacked on and pushed plugsched in an attempt to make it possible to work on 
an alternative implementation that would make the transition possible in a 
stable series. This was vetoed by Linus and Ingo and yourself for the reason 
it dilutes developer effort on the current scheduler. Which leaves us with 
only continually polishing what is already in place.
None of this is news of course but it helps to set the history for outside 
observers of this thread.
Cheers,
Con
