Subject: [PATCH] Remove apparently unused IPDDP_DECAP kernel config variable.

  Remove an apparently unused, Appletalk-related kernel config
variable IPDDP_DECAP.
Signed-off-by: Robert P. J. Day <rpjday@mindspring.com>
---
  the kernel config variable IPDDP_DECAP seems superfluous given where
else one finds the string "IPDDP_DECAP" in the kernel source tree
(other than defconfig files), none of which seem to make use of the
config variable:
./drivers/net/appletalk/ipddp.h:#define IPDDP_DECAP     2
./drivers/net/appletalk/ipddp.c:static int ipddp_mode = IPDDP_DECAP;
./drivers/net/appletalk/ipddp.c:        if(ipddp_mode == IPDDP_DECAP)
./drivers/net/appletalk/ipddp.c:        if(ipddp_mode == IPDDP_DECAP)
