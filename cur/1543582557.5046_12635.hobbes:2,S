Hi,
   How does linux support more than 4G memory? I 've read the
   documentation of  Intel IA-32 Architecture, I knew that OS
   just address up to 4G physical address space, If OS want to
   access additional 4-GByte section of physical memory, it must
   change the pointer in register CR3 or entries in the
   page-directory-pointer table. That means that Linux just has
   up to 4-GByte page mapping at one time , is that right?
