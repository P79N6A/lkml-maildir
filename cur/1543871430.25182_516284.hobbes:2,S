Unfortunately there is no mailinglist to approve this and some "central point of communication" besides Rick van Rein doesn't seem to exist. There is a fork named BadMEM at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/badmem,
 Memtest86 also supporting BadRAM and i have seen LOTs of discussion about BadRAM on the net. Most of that discussion was due to problems getting it run with Kernel XYZ.

Because most kernel developers don't have time to scour the net for
random kernel patches and pull them.  If you have a useful patch you
want merged it's up to you to push it.
What's so hard about submitting a 200 line patch to LKML?
