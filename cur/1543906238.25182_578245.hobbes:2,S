I assume "that task" = the RT99 task?  If so, that is precisely the
question.  It shouldn't wait.  ;)  With mainline, it is simply queued
with every other request.  There could be an RT40, and a SCHED_NORMAL in
front of it in the queue that will get processed first.  In addition,
the system could suffer from a priority inversion if some unrelated but
lower priority task (say RT98) was blocking the workqueue thread from
making forward progress on the nice -5 job. 
To clarify: when a design utilizes a singlethread per workqueue (such as
in both mainline and this patch), the RT99 will always have to wait
behind any already dispatched jobs.  That is a given.  However, with
Daniels patch, two things happen in addition to normal processing.
1) The RT99 task would move ahead in the queue of anything else that was
also scheduled on the workqueue that is < RT99.
2) The priority of the workqueue task would be temporarily elevated to
RT99 so that the currently dispatched task will complete at the same
priority as the waiter.  This prevents inversion.
