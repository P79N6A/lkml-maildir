We should split TASK_STOPPED into two different cases: TASK_STOPPED and 
TASK_PTRACED.
A true TASK_STOPPED continues on SIGCONT. A TASK_PTRACED only continues 
when the ptracer says so.
That should be trivially invisible to the user (the only part a user would 
see would be if we make "ps" show a different letter for the PTRACED 
state..)
