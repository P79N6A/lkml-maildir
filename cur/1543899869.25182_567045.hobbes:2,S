it does seem an improvement... but still not quite 100%.  now my system 
finishes booting but there's still lots of sata_mv warnings, and a simple 
dd from the disks on the sata_mv maxes out around 2MB/s.  i haven't tried 
anything more thorough.
dmesg attached... sorry it's a bit truncated, and pls ignore the MM0 
complaints, i've apparently got a bad umem nvram card in there.  it 
appears to contain the first sata_mv warnings so i think it's useful.
