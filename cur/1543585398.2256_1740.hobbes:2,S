I have similar problems.  I've got a reconfigurable non-APIC 8 way system with 
(currently) 4 p5-66 and 4 p5-166 processors.  I found the answer to (b) was 
simply to disable the TSC stuff---my processors aren't even guaranteed to be 
fed from the same clock, so there's no hope for TSC coherency.
I run into your problem (a) when trying a mixture of 486 and 586 processors.  
The simplest work around I find is just to make sure that the boot CPU has the 
lowest capability set (i.e. boot off a 486).  Could you just swap the order of 
your processors to achieve the same effect?
