Ok, I tried the ide2 patch on your website against -rc5 - Disabled CONFIG_IDE 
and kept rest of the configuration same as earlier. 
Funny situation - I cannot figure what my root device is. Earlier without the 
patch it was /dev/sda3 and now I try everything (hda3, hdb3, hdc3, hdd3, 
sda3, sdb3...) but it panics - not able to mount rootfs. 
I have -
00:1f.2 IDE interface: Intel Corporation 82801GBM/GHM (ICH7 Family) Serial ATA 
Storage Controller IDE (rev 01) (prog-if 80 [Master]) 
It prints some ata_piix message while booting  but I cannot read that since it 
scrolls fast and post panic obviously I can't scroll up!
Any default for the only one HDD and CDROM that I can try?
Thanks
Parag
