One of the most important changes this patch makes is to rip out all of the 
SGI PCI probing code.  Our PROM now probes for I/O devices and tells the 
kernel where they are (similar to the ACPI model, which we may get to 
eventually).  The result is much more readable code with less duplication.  
Please take a look and let us know if you have any feedback, since we'd like 
to get this in as soon as we release a PROM that supports probing.
Thanks,
Jesse
