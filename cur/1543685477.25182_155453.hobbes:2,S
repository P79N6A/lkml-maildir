Guess I wasn't clear enough. I unload all the modules (except for the fw
ones actually since for some reason they refuse to do so).
This includes the usb modules, before I suspend.
There some more info on the subject though. Apparently this happens only
when calling the hibernation script (from the swsusp page on
sourceforge) from acpid in response to the sleep button. When called
from the command line I don't see this behavior.
