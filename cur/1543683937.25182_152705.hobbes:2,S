It is bug in matroxfb. I sent patch to Linus already, but it did not found
its way through his email filters yet. I'll try again...

But anyway, you are trying to build your kernel without virtual terminal
support (and, BTW, did you enable support for keyboard?) and it is probably
not what you want. 
If you really insist on kernel without VT support (your screen will be
black! your monitor will poweroff...), you can apply patch from
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/matrox-latest/matroxfb-novt.gz.
