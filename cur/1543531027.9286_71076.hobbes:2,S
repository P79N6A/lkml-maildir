The only reason your non-overcommit situation doesn't fail is because you
gave that system more memory than the overcommitted system.
In order to make a reasonable comparison, you must keep the total VM
constant. The failure modes for a non-overcommitted system are a superset
of the failure modes of an overcommitted system.
Stated another way: for a fixed quantity of virtual memory, in low memory
situations, a system without overcommit will ALWAYS have a failure before
or at the same point as an overcommitted system.
