If I understand it correctly, I would need 'dm' in kernel (or module) 
and moreover I would need some userspace utilities/binaries.

So it is not in Kernel?
With current loop, people would need kernel patch and *no* userspace 
utilities.
With dm-loop, people would need kernel patch *and* userspace utilities.
So, from my point of view, it would be better to fix/enhance Linux's loop.
