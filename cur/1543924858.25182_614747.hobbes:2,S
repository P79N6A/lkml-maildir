Most always, you have only a few bits which change, and always for
the same bytes :
  31 -> 71 -> f1  (|40, |80)
  63 -> 6f -> 7b  (|0c, |10&~4)
It looks like a hardware problem to me. Maybe one version is more
optimized and puts more stress on the device ? I remember having
had comparable problems in the past with a CF connected to a
home-made IDE adapter on which the +5V wire had been cut. The CF
drained its power from the IDE signals and it would most always
work correctly, except when reading large files. Writing to it
finally killed it.
