Your patch doesn't look right.  Firstly, I'd rather stay away from
switch() if at all possible - past experience has shown that it
generates inherently poor code on ARM.  Whether that's still true
or not I've no idea, but I don't particularly want to find out at
the moment.

And the above rules this out.
As I say, I fixed ARM this morning, so changing these constants will
break it again.  Let's just wait for things to stabilise instead of
trying to race with architecture maintainers...
