So what do you think where the inodes come from for syscalls like fchmod? Out 
of struct file, of course. But your f_op->getattr and f_op->setattr patches 
are meant for passing struct file down to filesystems anyway, so that 
completely contradicts what you are saying above.

That's nothing but a replacement for ATTR_FILE and iattr->ia_file. Except by 
removing the ATTR_FILE flag, LSMs will no longer get that information for 
distinguishing file descriptor operations from other operations.
AppArmor needs to know when notify_change is called on a file descriptor, but 
it doesn't care about the file descriptor itself. So any way of passing along 
that information will be fine.
Thanks,
Andreas
