Hi Peter,
First, thanks for this doc.  It's good to have.
Second, where would I find earlier versions of it?
And where will they be found in the future?
A few typos/edits are corrected below.

I don't know about this, but I'm curious if
(64-setup_sects-1) shouldn't be (64-(setup_sects-1)) ==
                                (64-setup_sects+1) ?
Or maybe the length isn't critical.
