Please see this posting, which also contains a pointer to the
necessary patch:
http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0812.1/02305.html
According to GregKH it will be in -stable.10, but in the meantime you can
also apply the  patch from 
http://tinyurl.com/5gpqkj
 on top stable .8
(which introduced the regression) or .9.
At this point it is not clear whether the changes to inotify caused this
or just fell victim to the parallel regression in idr.
