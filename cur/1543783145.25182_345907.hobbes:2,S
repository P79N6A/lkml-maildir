Reading twice is sometimes better. :) It must have been late yesterday...
Well changing ID automagically can be okay because a system changes its ID 
from time to time and so you cannot track a certain system/person easily.
Why not generating a unique system ID at compilation stage of the kernel 
if the apopriate kernel option is enabled? This needn't have something to 
do with klive...just a unique kernel-ID or something like that.
klive, if userspace or not, finally makes use of this ID to generate live 
stats of kernel usage. PCI-IDs, CPU and whatever else could be used as a 
salt to generate a really UNIQE ID...
