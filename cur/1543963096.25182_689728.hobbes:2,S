i wouldnt advocate a 7500 revert instead of a 160 lines change.
my suggestion was that the scheduling behavior of the new 
kernel/semaphore.c code is causing the problem - i.e. making it match 
the old semaphore code's behavior would give us back performance.

it was removed by me in the course of this discussion:
   
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/2/58
the whole discussion started IIRC because !CONFIG_PREEMPT_BKL [the 
spinlock version] was broken for a longer period of time (it crashed 
trivially), because nobody apparently used it. People (Nick) asked why 
it was still there and i agreed and removed it. CONFIG_PREEMPT_BKL=y was 
the default, that was what all distros used. I.e. the spinlock code was 
in essence dead code at that point in time.
the spinlock code might in fact perform _better_, but nobody came up 
with such a workload before.

that's a good question...
