That I've no knowledge of.  The developers are claiming pretty decent 
performance from the breadboards now, in the top 85% I'd guess, but go 
check their site for clarification on that.  As to keeping up with new 
hardware, if the sales support it, then even newer ones will always be 
in the pipeline.  The key to success is as always, sales propaganda in 
Joe Six-packs face, and that, no surprise, costs money.  So when it is 
released, support it if you want to keep it alive.  To me, thats a no 
brainer.  But who am I but an old fart on SS...  If I can afford it, 
certainly lots of you younger folks can too.  Putting our money where 
our mouth is makes perfect sense to me and I'll do it at least once.  
Maybe 3 times as I have 3 boxes here.
