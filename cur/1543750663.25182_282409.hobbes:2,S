The new model has some good aspects to it, mainly that new fixes and 
features make it into the "stable" kernel a lot faster these days. But, it 
is not as stable/static as previous stable series.
Personally I think a lot of the problems could go away if the -mm tree was 
utilized more. 
How does something like this sound? 
2.6.x being stable means that :
 a) features are not removed
 b) patches applied to 2.6 have spend a minimum of time in -mm first (one 
    -mm release minimum? -mm release frequency would probably need to go 
    up a bit)
 c) interfaces do not change unless to fix a serious bug
That would make it a stable series in my book.
Development can still be rapid since -mm would be open to all the 
experimental stuff, and features could be removed in -mm etc.
If *all* patches go through -mm (critical security fixes possibly being 
the excetion) before ending up in mainline, then -mm won't get out of sync 
with mainline with regard to bugfixes - main differences would be new 
experimental stuff and removed features.
When should 2.7 open then?  Well, probably when -mm has diverged so much 
that it becomes a pain to maintain against 2.6 mainline, then it could be 
renamed 2.7.0 and work could start on stabilizing all the experimental 
stuff in it etc.
Does that sound completely insane or as something that could work?
I think it's not so far from what we have now.
