WTF does DOS come in? If they wanted, they could use a Linux kernel with
the filter bypassed. I'd regard using Linux just to write some data to
memory as overkill, TBH; FreeDOS would probably make more sense for a lot
of things. However, I do NOT want to see this sort of highly unusual
action supported in the standard kernel: if you reflash your BIOS or
firmware, you will need to reboot anyway. Why not use a manufacturer's
boot disk/image? That way, they can't blame it on your anti-virus daemon,
your NIC, the kernel version you're running, etc.
