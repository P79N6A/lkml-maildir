I already have rp_filter to 0 for all interfaces. It is rather a
checksumming problem than a routing one. Only if there was such an easy way
to disable checksumming as there is for solaris, disabling both the
rp_filter and the checksums would finally end the problem. The poor system
still think that it is getting the packet from 192.168.1.1 because the IP
header tells as such, while the problematic network device computes the
TCP/UDP checksum as if it is still sending it via its 192.168.77.1 source
address. There is the kernel, and the code in it which handles checksumming.
But I doubt whether a simple patch would do...
