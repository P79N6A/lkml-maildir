Well, it sure triggered.

and it's that same sgl_unmap_user_pages() that keeps on triggering it.
Which was not what I was hoping for. I was hoping we'd see somebody _else_ 
decrementing the page count below the map count, and get a new clue.
However, the page flags you show later on (0x1c) ended up making me take 
notice of something. That's "dirty", and maybe it's from
	if (dirtied)
		SetPageDirty(page);
in that same sgl_unmap_user_pages() routine.. And it strikes me that that 
is bogus.
Code like that should use "set_page_dirty()", which does the appropriate 
callbacks to the filesystem for that page. I wonder if the bug is simply 
because the ST code just sets the dirty bit without telling anybody else 
about it...
Gaah. Hugh, Nick?
