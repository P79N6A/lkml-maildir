That matches for me too. My drives are also too old to support barriers. 
It occours on about 35 servers - so not all filesystems could be damaged.
So please recheck the following:
1.) You need a Kernel, where barriers are on by default:
so something like: 2.6.16.2x or 2.6.17.x
I'm not shure of the minimal version for the 2.6.16.x Kernel tree.
2.) that hda2 is / on your system
3.) you boot your system with kernel option rootflags=quota
4.) do not use mount, to deactivate quota - use quotaoff / command
5.) then reboot your system...
