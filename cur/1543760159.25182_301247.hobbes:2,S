Strongly disagree. What if the mainline fix is a rewrite of the core API
involved. Some times you need to put in the short term fix. What must
never happen is people accepting that fix as long term.
How about
 - It must be accepted to mainline, or the accepted mainline patch be
deemed too complex or risky to backport and thus a simple obvious
alternative fix applied to stable ONLY.
