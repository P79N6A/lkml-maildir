oha,  just because I read the patch wrongly (I somehow though it added
a binary format)  I now don't understand the personalities at all?
Remember that I wrote most of the code that's now in kernel/exec_domain.c..

That's what's happening if people hack last minute changes into 2.4
instead of properly going through 2.5 and the maintainer.

The inkernel solution exists, and it's a bad (though valueable) hack.

Umm, quemu exists for about two weeks now.  I think you're pressing
a bit too much.
Why is there a time constraint?  It worked for you up to now without
this patch in mainline and you can keep patching your trees for 2.4.21,
too.

Please try it in userspace first, if it's really not doable we can abuse
the kernel for it, but I'd prefer not doing it.  And if we need to do
it in the kernel we should think about a sys_altroot mechanism that doesn't
rely on the personality handling which isn't needed by qemu at all but
rather just exposes set_fs_altroot to userspace directly.  In fact that
sounds like a very good idea to start with.  What about hacking it up
for 2.5? :)
