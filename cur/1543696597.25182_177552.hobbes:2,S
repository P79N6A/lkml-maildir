It does not work either. If CVSROOT files are updated at the end, you can 
still fetch some new files and be able to fetch the old CVSROOT before the 
update process will be able to do it. I believe that the LOCK file idea 
should work pretty nicely. The update process goes like:
create LOCK
update repo
remove LOCK
While the client can simply:
do
    rsync
while exist LOCK
