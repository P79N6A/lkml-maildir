Just to through this out, I'm working on project right now where we want 
to use the latest Kernel Headers, but since LLH is pretty much dead we 
came up with a interim solution until something else gets worked out. 
The script lists below only sanitizes the headers that are needed by 
userspace, there may be some missing, but this has worked on the systems 
I've built up to this point.
