Because this is all part of the module init code and our purpose here is
not locking out other users of the card (which is already accomplished via
the fact that card->initializing != 0 at the moment so any other attempts
to access the card, which must first go through the open routine to get a
file handle to the device, are all blocking in i810_open() or
i810_mixer_open() waiting on card->initializing to become 0)  but instead
it is merely intended to stop all interrupts that might skew our timing
via udelay() on the local CPU (it's actually pretty important that we keep 
our variance from a real 50ms delay as small as possible, since the more 
variance we allow in this loop the more likely it will be that our sound 
card will play sounds either a bit too fast or too slow).
