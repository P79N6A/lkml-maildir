Ok.  (But now you're going to argue with me about "remove OPEN_MAX",
and you haven't said you have any problem with changing SCM_MAX_FD,
so why make it wait?)

Ok, fine.  But PATH_MAX is a real constant that has some meaning in the
kernel.  It's perfectly correct to use PATH_MAX as a constant on a system
like Linux that defines it and means what it says.  Conversely, OPEN_MAX
has no useful relationship with anything the kernel is doing at all.

Well, I don't know for sure.  It doesn't seem all that likely to me (not
like PATH_MAX), as there has been getdtablesize() since before there was
OPEN_MAX by that name (not to mention before there was Linux).  If things
use OPEN_MAX as a constant for arrays, they're already broken unless they
call setrlimit to constrain themselves.  Getting things fixed has to start
somewhere.
Thanks,
Roland
