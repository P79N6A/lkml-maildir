Ingo,
I looked through some of the Tux docs and stuff over the weekend.  You
are correct, it looks an awful lot like the Topology Support Module
Layer in NetWare, and I agree it provides very similiar semantics.  I
won't know how Alan's code stacks up against NetWare until I complete
the port, but I think we will see performance at least equal to Native
NetWare if we include your tux stuff with it.
