Actually, this is more simple. Somehow I missed that setf() _always_
updates ->f_flags, so we have a trivial race with 2 threads.

Perhaps, we can add O_LOCK_FLAGS, then something like
	--- a/fs/fcntl.c
	+++ b/fs/fcntl.c
	@@ -175,6 +175,15 @@ static int setfl(int fd, struct file * f

What do you think?
(btw, ioctl_fioasync() calls lock_kernel() but it doesn't protect ->f_flags)
