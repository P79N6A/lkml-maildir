Alan,
	I'm curious what caused the machine to freeze now whereas it didn't some
kernels ago. I don't know when I blanked a whole CD-RW the last time. But I know
it didn't freeze the machine. OK, maybe it's caused by some setting I missed (or
enabled) but I use the config now for along time. :/
I'm also curious when DELL will release their first mobile with SCSI onboard
instead of IDE. The chips are the same size... 
Thanks anyone for clarification. There's still sooo much to learn. But the code
is here and I'll try to do my very best... ;)
