Hi,
I had an interesting effect: Due to NVdriver I had a lot of system 
freezes, and I had to reboot. Using e2fsck 1.19a (SuSE 7.1) I got the 
message that one specific "Special (device/socket/fifo) inode .. has 
non-zero size. FIXED."
Interestingly I got the message for every reboot. So either the kernel 
corrupts the very same inode every time, or e2fsck does not really fix 
it, or the error simply doesn't exist. I think the kernel doesn't 
temporarily set the size to non-zero, so this seems strange.
Regards,
Ulrich
