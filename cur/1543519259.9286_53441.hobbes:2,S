If I use both hdparm -m16 and -u1 my virtual memory gets corrupted in
2.2.14pre13. It's ok if either I don't use ide block mode or if I don't
unmask interrupts. I run two memtest processes (by Simon Kirby) on the
console so that the machine swaps constantly and in a couple of minutes
either one of them reports a memory error. No X nor modem in use. With
kernel 2.2.13 there are no problems.
This is a 486 with ide in PIO mode (IBM-DTTA-350840).
I guess this is the same problem as I reported earlier. When I have X, ppp
and netscape running while swapping, I get oopses in end_that_request_first.
It's also ok if I don't use ide block mode. And it's ok with 2.2.13 even
when I both use ide block mode and unmask interrupts.
