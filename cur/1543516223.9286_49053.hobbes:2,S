Hi out there!
As this is the official mailing list for discussion concerning the
kerneli patches (maybe there should be a linux-crypto ml, please tell me
if it exists):
FYI: Version 0.1.0-pre2 of the Encryption-HOWTO is now available at
http://marc.mutz.com/Encryption-HOWTO/.
It is a very preliminary version, but nonetheless useful for people who
want to encrypt their disks, I think. Networking is not included yet, as
esp. FreeS/WAN is a very complex package. Preliminary discussion (in the
style of section "Other disk encryption approaches") on all network
crypto approaches mentioned in section headings is on the to-do list for
v0.1.0, which will be the first version sent to the LDP.
Please give this one a read and shout back errors I made in it. Please
understand, however, that suggestions for non-bugs are just filed until
after the network section has grown a bit more.
Thanks to all of you that spare time to read through it...
Marc
