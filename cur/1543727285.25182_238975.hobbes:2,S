To evaluate your patch, I tested -mm kernels for thrashing generated
by our benchmark suit.
In 2.6.8-rc2-mm2, performance of application increased, and overhead
of kernel decreased.
** Overview of workload
 Benchmark program creates disk I/O processes and shared memory access
 processes. Generating disk I/O and shared memory access at the same
 time.
** Detailed environment of performance evaluation
 - Hardware
   CPU: Xeon 1.6GHz * 4
   Memory: 2GB
   HDD: IDE ATA100 
 - The benchmark suit 
   The benchmark suit is the wblg-disk, which I have released on
   SourceForge.
   <
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=110454&package_id=119281>
 
   # I used alpha version (1.0.3-alpha) in this test.
   # I will release 1.0.3 soon.
 - configuration of benchmark
   1. disk IO workload
     + number of process: 4 processes
     + read/write ratio: read 0% / write 100%
     + file IO size: 1KB - 256KB (random) 
   2. memory access workload
     + number of process: 32 processes
     + Shard memory regions: 512MB * 4 
     + Each process accesses one shared memory region.
       (8 processes share one shared memory region.)
     + Each process repeats 4 byte memory access each 4KB.
   Measurement time: 1 hour
   Measurement items: write throughput
 - Other configurations
   Using Oprofile 
   Issue vmstat command each 1 minute
