Hi Ingo,
I read through your patch and I think it looks great.  I'm one of the
ieee1394 maintainers, and we also a have a worker thread mechanism in
the ieee1394 subsystem, which could (and will, I'm going to look into
this) be replaced by your work queue stuff.  We use the thread for
reading configuration information from ieee1394 devices.  This work
isn't very performance critical, but the reason we dont just use
keventd is that we don't want to stall keventd while reading this
information.  So, my point is, that in this case (I'm sure there are
more situations like this, usb has a similar worker thread, khubd),
the per-cpu worker thread is overkill, and it would be sufficient with
just one thread, running on all cpus.  So maybe this could be an
option to create_workqueue()?  Either create a cpu-bound thread for
each cpu, or create one thread that can run on all cpus.
Another minor comment: why do you kmalloc() the workqueue_t?  Wouldn't
it be more flexible to allow the user to provide a pointer to a
pre-allocated workqueue_t structure, e.g.:
        static workqueue_t aio_wq;
        [...]
               	create_workqueue(&aio_wq, "aio");
