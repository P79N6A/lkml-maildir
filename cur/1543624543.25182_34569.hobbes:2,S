If several processors are idle, say CPU0 busy and CPU[123] idle, does it
preferentially use a "CPU" on another chip? And does that make any
difference? It's not clear to me if the HT CPUs share cache or not, they
obviously share bandwidth from L2 to RAM.
I'm looking at P4 chips and boards, my 2Q02 budget has some $$ for a
system. I also will be getting some laptops 3Q02, does the new P4-M mobile
chip by any chance have HT? If so a good reason to go Intel, assuming that
either the BIOS or Linux can get it to use the feature ;-)
