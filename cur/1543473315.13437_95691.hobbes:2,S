Hi Riley,
I took a close look at your patch:
 bool 'Networking support' CONFIG_NET
 bool 'PCI support' CONFIG_PCI
 if [ "$CONFIG_PCI" = "y" ]; then
-  bool '   PCI BIOS support' CONFIG_PCI_BIOS
-  bool '   PCI direct access support' CONFIG_PCI_DIRECT
-  if [ "$CONFIG_PCI_BIOS" = "n" -a "$CONFIG_PCI_DIRECT" = "n" ]; then
+  unset CONFIG_PCI_BIOS CONFIG_PCI_DIRECT
+  choice 'PCI access mode' \
+       "BIOS           CONFIG_PCI_GOBIOS       \
+        Direct         CONFIG_PCI_GODIRECT     \
+        Any            CONFIG_PCI_GOANY"       Any
+  if [ -n "$CONFIG_PCI_GOBIOS" -o -n "$CONFIG_PCI_GOANY" ]; then
     define_bool CONFIG_PCI_BIOS y
+  fi
+  if [ -n "$CONFIG_PCI_GODIRECT" -o -n "$CONFIG_PCI_GOANY" ]; then
+    define_bool CONFIG_PCI_DIRECT y
   fi
Will you please test your code on your own damn machine before you send
it to Linus with cc: to linux-kernel?
And if you are going to write Config.in code, stay the hell away from
features that no other Config.in file uses.  You are asking for bugs
and they are occurring.
This code doesn't work on xconfig, ok fine, xconfig is the black sheep
configuration method anyways.  We will make xconfig work, one way or
another.
But your code doesn't work in make configure.
It doesn't work in make oldconfig.
It doesn't work in make menuconfig.
In all of these configuration methods, it always sets both CONFIG_PCI_BIOS
and CONFIG_PCI_DIRECT, no matter what choice the user selects.
Did you notice that?
Did you spend even 10 minutes testing your code before sending it to Linus?
(By the way, the reason -n doesn't work for choice list items is actually
documented in the history comments of Menuconfig.  Menuconfig has behaved
this way since 13 November 1997.  Configure has *always* behaved this way.)
