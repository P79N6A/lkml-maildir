OK, seems to work now, but it's still no faster:
SDET 128  (see disclaimer)
                           Throughput    Std. Dev
          2.5.70-mm1-ext2       100.0%         0.1%
          2.5.70-mm1-ext3        22.7%         2.0%
          2.5.70-mm1-noxa        21.4%         4.6%
          2.5.70-mm2-ext3        20.5%         2.4%
(last one has both your patches in).
I had the sem tracing one in there too, but got no output. I might have
another look at that later on ...
