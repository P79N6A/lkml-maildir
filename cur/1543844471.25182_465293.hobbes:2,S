I agree.
But even on that note I would love to have a release cycle where I
didn't merge any new features and could work entirely on the bugs
that never get worked on.
Sure, I'll still be merging new features into my "N + 1" tree.
But my pure interactions with Linus's tree can focus entirely
on bug fixing, and I really want an environment in which to
concentrate on that exclusively.
I think the even/odd idea is great, personally.  And if this
makes some people have to wait a little bit longer for their
favorite feature to get merged, that's tough. :-)
I truly think we need to move towards a more stability minded
mode and back off on the new features just a bit.
