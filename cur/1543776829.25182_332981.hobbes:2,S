Hello, Daniel,
In principle, one could inspect the Linux kernel with the PREEMPT_RT patch
applied, and calculate the worst-case time during which interrupts are
disabled, though I have not heard of anyone actually doing this.  Is this
what you are getting at, or are you thinking in terms of Kristian's and
Karim's testing?
							Thanx, Paul
