Dear friends,
I am rather new to Linux, but really want to have a try. I am running RedHat
7.2 with the kernel of
2.4.7-10. I just compiled the 2.4.12 and 2.4.16 Kernel, however, when I
login to the system, I found that
1)
Login: root
Passwd:
bash: id: Command not found
bash: id: Command not found
bash: id: Command not found
[: Too many arguments
...
2) all the files under /home, /usr are missing, this happens both for 2.4.12
and 2.4.16, but when I login back to 2.4.7-10, the files are there again, I
can't figure it out.
Any help is welcome.
Thanks.
