Well, quite frankly, there are other changes between 2.6.18 and 2.6.21 
that are more likely to be a big deal than Peter's patches. No offense to 
Peter, but we also cut the default dirty percentage by a factor of four in 
that timeframe, and that made a *huge* difference for some setups (and 
admittedly not so much on others ;)

Hey, I'm not complaining. I think the code looks fine. I just want to make 
sure that it actually helps.

So do the patches really end up helping your case? Or is this just why 
you're following it, and hoping they'll eventually do so?
