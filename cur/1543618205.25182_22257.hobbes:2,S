Whee, an IDE flamewar! :-)
People, can we get colder? Let's clarify positions without generating useless 
heat, ok?
1. Re multi-sector reads/writes:

Seems logical to me too. Imagine we have told drive to use 16 sector multi 
mode. Now we are trying to read 24 sectors (6 pages of 4k each):
CPU                       IDE
------------- ---------------
read_multiple(sect cnt=24) ->
         *reading 16 sectors*
                 <- interrupt
give me data ->
 (asm: 'rep insw')
<- <- <-16bit words with data
<- <- <-  (total: 16 sectors)
          *reading 8 sectors*
                 <- interrupt
give me data ->
<- <- <-16bit words with data
<- <- <-   (total: 8 sectors)
Andre, do you think that it is _not_ ok to do multi-sector read/write ops 
with sector count non-divisible by programmed multisector count?
Do you have or know of some existing drive which misbehaves? Do you think 
such drive will appear in future?
2. Re cotiguous buffer for large PIO blocks:

Do I understand OLD method correctly? Example: reading 128 sectors
in one transfer (assuming drive can do 128 multisector PIO):
void* page[16];  /* holds addresses of target 4k pages */
...
/* in interrupt handler: get data from IDE in PIO mode */
i=0;
while(i<16) {
    rep_insw(4096/2, page[i]);   
        /* rep_insw() in i386 pseudo-asm: 
        dx=ioport; ecx=4096/2; edi=page[i]; cld; rep insw 
        */
    i++;
}
...
I don't see flaws here, IDE will never notice that buffer is non-contiguous
(except for tiny delay between insw's while i++ and i<16 get executed).
Andre, can you explain what's wrong here and why you think we need CORRECT 
method?
