I am having only one harddisk of 20 Gb , so i made four partitions on it.

But it is more bad then i described , especially when i do telnet/ssh from
my home .
I am not able to understand why Linux read and/or write harddisk after some
time (after few hours ) , harddisk read/write leds keep on glowing for few
minutes , even though nobody working on it and machine is in idle state.

yes i am taking about 2.2.12 .
And in my 2.4.2 :-
Harddisk read-write problem is also there , during harddisk read-write
activity i took two hdparams and i got :-
i . 963.76 kB/sec
ii. 1.05 MB/sec
and when my machine becomes normal i got :-
9.07 MB/sec
and after hdparam -d1 i got :-
9.55 MB/sec
But my problem is why linux boxes do not response for few seconds
(sometimes) and especially during telnet/ssh it looks more worst and looks
similar to Microsoft Windows :(
there is problem in scheduling or what ?
Thank you,
Best Regards,
Jaswinder.
