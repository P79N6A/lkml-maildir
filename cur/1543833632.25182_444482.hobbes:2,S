Oh wait.. I remember this.. No, those are DMA commands,
despite the misleading libata name for them.  We went through
this before last spring..
Okay.  So I wonder what's really going on.
The next step would be to instrument the interrupt handler,
so that when it sees bad-status, it dumps out the stat/err values
right then and there, before anything else can muck with them.
It might also be good to have it dump out the controller engine's
DMA status/err values, assuming the controller has registers for those.
Then we should get a better picture of what's going on.
Assuming the drives aren't lying to us (a perfectly good assumption here),
then the controller must be aborting the transfer unexpectedly.
Cheers
