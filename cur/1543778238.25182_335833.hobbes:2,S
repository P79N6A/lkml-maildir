No it measures the performance of the "time()" call. Windows has some
funky optimisations that we never bother with because time() isn't a hot
path in the real world.
Instead try code which does
time(&start);
while(count++ < LOTS) {
  Do_stuff
}
time(&end)
and you'll find the numbers on pure CPU work are essentially CPU bound
not OS affected at all
