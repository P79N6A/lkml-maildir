Subject: Configure.help has complete coverage for 2.4 and 2.5.

For only the second time in recorded history, the master
Configure.help file now has help entries corresponding to *all*
configuration symbols in live use in the kernel tree (both 2.4 and
2.5).  It is available for your downloading pleasure at:

Fossil entries in this version have been garbage-collected out (I'm
keeping them in a dead-entries file in case any of them becomes
interesting again.)  Entries for which the question symbol has merely
been commented out in CML1 have been retained.
I had to write over 600 of the entries in this version myself,
including the last six.  Please don't put me through that again --
when you add a config option, *include a Configure.help entry in your
patch*.  Not documenting how and why to configure your option is both
sloppy and antisocial.  I beseech the current Elder Gods of the kernel
to reject future patches that neglect this step.
Thanks to everyone who responded well to my nagging by sending in entries.

Strict gun laws are about as effective as strict drug laws...It pains
me to say this, but the NRA seems to be right: The cities and states
that have the toughest gun laws have the most murder and mayhem.
