In arch/mips/cobalt/pci.c:
static struct resource cobalt_io_resource = {
        .start  = 0x1000,
        .end    = GT_DEF_PCI0_IO_SIZE - 1,
        .name   = "PCI I/O",
        .flags  = IORESOURCE_IO,
};
static struct pci_controller cobalt_pci_controller = {
	[...]
        .io_resource    = &cobalt_io_resource,
        .io_offset      = 0 - GT_DEF_PCI0_IO_BASE,
};
The .io_offset initialization looks odd; no other platform is trying to
use a negative offset here.  I think there was something odd with the
Galileo GT-64111 which (unlike its later sucessors such as the GT-64120)
passes memory accesses in the range 0x10000000 ... 0x11ffffff to the PCI
bus unmodified.  That is for example a load or store to physical address
0x100003f8 will become an I/O port access to 0x100003f8.
I hope this is just a missconfiguration of the GT-64111, time for manual
reading.
