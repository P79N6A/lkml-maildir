Hi Folks,
  Inside each arch-specific kernel/irq.c, there's a comment something like, 
  /* (mostly architecture independent, will move to kernel/irq.c in 2.5.) */
This obviously hasn't happened, even though there was a patch by
Andrey Panin floating about around a year ago.  Is there some
fundamental objection to consolidating the IRQ handling as far as
possible, or was it just that the patch didn't get high enough profile?
