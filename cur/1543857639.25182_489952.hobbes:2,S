At least
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/chrisw/stable/patch-2.6.19.1-rc1.gz
and
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/chrisw/stable/patch-2.6.19.1-rc2.gz
seem to contain an incompletely applied "[patch 24/32] add bottom_half.h",
bottom_half.h itself is missing, while interrupt.h and spinlock.h are changed 
to use the missing file:
$ wget -qO- 
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/chrisw/stable/patch-2.6.19.1-rc2.gz
 | gzip -dc | grep bottom_half
+#include <linux/bottom_half.h>
+#include <linux/bottom_half.h>
$ wget -qO- 
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/chrisw/stable/patch-2.6.19.1-rc1.gz
 | gzip -dc | grep bottom_half
+#include <linux/bottom_half.h>
+#include <linux/bottom_half.h>
