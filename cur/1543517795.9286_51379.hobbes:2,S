Actually Solar's patch has something like this implemented, hidden
behind the {[*] Restricted links in /tmp} config option, but it is even
more restrictive with hardlinks, it allows only the owner to make
hardlinks. Since it breaks some software like the mailman mailing list
manager, I proposed him to allow hardlinks on files with write access, he
said it still has some security implications but he'd think about it, I
don't know what happened since...
