if you had spent the time you spent on this colorful graphic on reading
SUS or Posix about what sched_yield() means, you would actually have
learned something. sched_yield() means "I'm the least important thing in
the system". It's the wrong thing for cross-cpu spinlocks; futexes are
optimal for that. For letting higher priority tasks run a sleep(0) is
also far more closer to the right behavior than a sched_yield().
