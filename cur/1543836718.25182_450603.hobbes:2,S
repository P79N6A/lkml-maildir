That's what everything was saying, like when I tried to run any program.
Eventually, things that were running stayed running (e.g. I have irssi
  on one box showing symptoms and can still chat, but opening up a 
  new window in screen fails:
Could not write /var/run/utmp: No such process                                  
cannot exec '/bin/bash': Input/output error                                     
On reboot everything was fixed.  And the SMART diagnostic on a drive:
# 1  Extended offline    Completed without error       00%     12221 -
Some relevant SMART data:
5 Reallocated_Sector_Ct   0x0033   100   100   050    Pre-fail  Always -       0
1 Raw_Read_Error_Rate     0x000b   100   100   050    Pre-fail Always       -       0
196 Reallocated_Event_Count 0x0032   100   100   000    Old_age Always       -       0
198 Offline_Uncorrectable   0x0030   100   100   000    Old_age Offline      -       0
199 UDMA_CRC_Error_Count    0x0032   200   200   000    Old_age   Always -       0
I'll send the .config from the other downed box when I can get to it
  to reboot it.

It seemed to, but I'm far from certain.

That will be very tough atm.  I'll see what I can do, though.
