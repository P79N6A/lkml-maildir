Get new firmware for your printer. It's broken. The connection
timed out because the connection timed out, i.e., when the printer
is out of paper, it refuses to ACK incoming packets. You do not
modify a standard TCP/IP implementation to fix a broken printer.
The printer is expecting to hold-off incoming network data, by
refusing to ACK it, until someone adds more paper. This is
unconsionable behavior that violates any standards of Engineering
practice. There is no time-out you could increase because the
printer may be out-of-paper forever, i.e., somebody needs to go
buy some. Network-connected devices just can't do things this
way. The name of the vendor should be published and the vendor
"educated" in such a way that no such printers remain connected
to a network until they are fixed.
And, if Linux didn't follow the standard, and let dead "connected"
devices remain in a connected state, servers that use connections
would would become impossible.
