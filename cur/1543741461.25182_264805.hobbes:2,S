Andrew,
everthing is OK now.
I managed to empty my 'usr/initramfs_list'. (I've put the wrong directory 
into the config option)
I've noticed this when 'patch - R' was complaining when I removed the 
2.6.10-rc1 patch. I've tried 2.6.9-mm1 and this also works fine.
My box is running 2.6.10-rc1-bk3 atm and is working as expected.
Greetings,
Hans
