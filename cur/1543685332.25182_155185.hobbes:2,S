Yep, Erik noticed this already.

What problems?  This reflects real change in drive's identify
and I think should be replaced by rereading drive->id from a drive.

I can't spot place when we get info from a BIOS.
If we get it from a user, user should know what she/he is doing.
We can deal with HPA before our geometry info is set
(by moving code that is in idedisk_setup() right before call to
init_idedisk_capacity()).

User gets correct report from HDIO_GET_IDENTIFY as drive's identify was
really changed.  Moreover HDIO_GET_IDENTIFY needs fixing to actually
reread drive->id from a drive (similarly like /proc identify was fixed).

Even if disk's info changes?  I don't think so.
