I never claimed such a thing. Whether an API is unprotectable or not
is a question for the lawyers.
If people put GPL_ONLY symbol exports in their code, that's their call
to make, is it not? It's their code and they're free to say "well, this
is my code, and if you use this symbol, I consider your stuff to be a
derived work". Once again it's up to the lawyers to decide whether
this has legal value or not.
