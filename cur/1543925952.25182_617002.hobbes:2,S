Great! Thanks for being so responsive to comments Sam.
I've just built v2.6.24-rc2-409-g9418d5d + your patchset for both amd64 and 
i386 using Debian's kernel-package and both went without problems.
One (minor) issue. If I start out with a .config for i386, the first make 
oldconfig will ask to set 64-BIT:
    64-bit kernel (64BIT) [N/y/?] (NEW)
It would be nice if that could be avoided somehow.
I'm compiling the 32-bit kernel in an i386 chroot on an x86_64 system.
Cheers,
FJP
