AFAIK the best you can do is to get the most recent XFS kernel from
SGI's CVS (this one is based on 2.6.10).
If you run that kernel, then most of the former problems will be gone;
*) I only have one undeletable directory on my system - so it seems that
this error is no longer common   ;)
*) 2.6.10 apparently fixes the knfsd stale handle problem
*) I no longer see the weird directory/file/??? mode problems or random
ownership assignment
So apart from the general well known instability problems that will
occur when you actually start *using* the system, there should be no
major problems running XFS+SMP+NFS on SGI's 2.6.10 based kernel   ;)
