But this doesn't reduce the binary size of the module, right?

You know, we do have arrays of attributes that can be registered with a
single call...
I'd recommend using that over this mess anyday :)

No, I hate HEAD and TAIL macros.  This really isn't buying you much code
savings, you could do it yourself with the __ATTR() macro yourself with
the same ammount of code I bet...
Or use the new macro that Yani created, that will make it even smaller
:)
