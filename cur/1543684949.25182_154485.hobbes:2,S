Yes yes, but we come to the same conclusion no matter why you have decided
to make the change ;) namely that you're only papering over a flaw in the
scheduler!
What happens in the same sort of workload that is using interruptible 
sleeps?
Say the same make -j NFS mounted interrruptible (I think?).
I didn't really understand your answer a few emails ago... please just
reiterate: if the problem is that processes sleeping too long on IO get
too high a priority, then give all processes the same boost after they
have slept for half a second?
Also, why is this a problem exactly? Is there a difference between a
process that would be a CPU hog but for its limited disk bandwidth, and
a process that isn't a CPU hog? Disk IO aside, they are exactly the same
thing to the CPU scheduler, aren't they?
_wants_ to be a CPU hog, but can't due to disk
