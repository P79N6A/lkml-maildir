Andrew, here is the patch with the comment for the problem described below.
Patch comment:
If SIGKILL does not have priority, we cannot instantly kill task
before it makes some unexpected job. It can be critical, but we
were unable to reproduce this easily until Heiko Carstens 
<Heiko.Carstens@de.ibm.com> reported this problem on LKML.

>>>
>>>  sigaction(SIGILL, &act, 0);
>>>  sigaction(SIGSEGV, &act, 0);
>>>
>>>  asm volatile(".long 0\n");

>>>
>>>The instruction in the asm block is suppossed to be an

>>>always a SIGILL pending too, which will be handled before
>>>the SIGKILL because of its lower number (see next_signal()
>>>in kernel/signal.c).
>>>The only possibly way this signal would be handled would
>>>be that the process is running in userspace while trying
>>>to handle the delivered SIGILL, where it would be interrupted
>>>by an interrupt and upon return to userspace do_signal()
>>>would be called again. This is unfortunately very unlikely
>>>if you are running a nearly timer interrupt free kernel
>>>like we do on s390/s390x.
>>>Since the OOM killer set the TIF_MEMDIE flag for our
>>>process it now is allowed to eat up all the memory left
>>>and our system is more or less dead until you're lucky
>>>and an interrupt hits at the right time and finally
>>>causing the process to be terminated...
