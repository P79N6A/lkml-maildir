EnE datasheet says it's also available in EnE 1211, 1225, 1420.
and since they are TI clones why not for the TI's too?
ico,
one question. when you insert the card in windows it changes
the latency timer at 0x0d to 0xff. what is the value at 0x1b? is it also 0xff?
if it's not 0xff can you try changing it to 0xff and set 0xc9 to 0x06?
i ask 'cos your screenshot w/o the card has it set to 0x00. and i have
the feeling that the bit at 0xc9 has something to do with the latency
timers....
