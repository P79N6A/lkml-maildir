That does imply some muppet 'extended' the debug interface for power
management on your laptop. Also pretty much proves that for such systems
we do have to move from port 0x80 to another delay approach.
Ingo - the fact that so many ISA bus devices need _p to mean "ISA bus
clocks" says to me we should keep the _p port 0x80 using variant for old
systems/device combinations (eg ISA ethernet cards) which won't show up
in any problem system (we know this from 15 odd years of testing), but
stop using it for PCI and embedded devices on modern systems.
