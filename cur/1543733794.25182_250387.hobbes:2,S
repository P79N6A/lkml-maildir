With the feedback I've seen thus far, it seems that one possible
explanation for this is, that the patch only papers over the problem (by
changing XFS), but that the real problem is not in XFS and thus might be
fixed for real by a completely different set of patches (which sort of
makes sense since the small patch only cures the problem in the common
cases).
We'll know more about this tomorrow, hopefully, if Anders gets the new
test system up and running.

Slab usage in kilo-kilo-bytes (one K on the graph is one Megabyte):

Anders will hopefully get a lot of this testing done tomorrow - by then
hopefully we'll know a lot more about all this.

Veritas BackupExec was used, as far as I know
xfsdump will be tested soon.
The "small server" is backed up with tar (by Amanda).

Read on   ;)

They've known for 7 months (bug 309 in your bugzilla), but the problem
is still trivially triggered in 2.6.8.1.
That's why I posted to LKML.
We got a lot of very useful feedback from a broad audience, and it seems
that it *might* turn out that this XFS problem was never really a
problem in XFS itself.
Let's see what tomorrow brings.
Thaks all!
