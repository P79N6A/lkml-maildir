people in adding them.
So below I present some "Purposes", YetAnotherTag, and a comment on
the RSO.
(And I'd like to add a vote for "Blame-Shared-By:" rather than
"Reviewed-by:", however I don't I'll get much support...)

                Authors should also provide a Signed-off-by: tag.
                Purpose: to give credit to authors

                Purpose: to allow subsequent review of the originality of 
                the contribution should copyright questions arise.

                Purpose:  to inform upstream aggregators that

This seems more detailed that necessary.  The process (communicated
back / responded) is not really relevant.  I would go for something
like:
    (b) I have no outstanding problems, concerns, or questions about
        this patch (except as noted in the above comments).
and in fact, given (c2), (b) might not be needed at all.
