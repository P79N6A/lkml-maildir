That question rings a bell :)
I had this discussion with Deniel Laurent on 8/30 and it sounded like 
that wouldn't be a problem after all.

The rationale is that the propagation code already made this module 
param obsolete, so the next step was to remove it entirely since it 
had no effect anyway.
According to the propagation RFC we sent on 2/6, multicast list, 
allmulti flag and promisc flag are all controlled the same way, and 
that is according to the USES_PRIMARY macro. When the bond uses the 
current slave as a primary interface, it, and only it, is supposed to 
have the bond's properties, while in aggregation modes all slaves 
have the same settings. There is no point in settings other slaves, 
that are not supposed to be receiving in the first place, to have 
loose filtering. Otherwise the stack will be flooded by duplicate 
packets. The situation is bad enough now since bonding has no 
solution for broadcast packets, but that's for another thread.
