This looks like a bit of an anomaly.. The code that isn't shown above is
the "kfree(dev)" .. So this isn't legal since it's freeing a locked
mutex. Here's a excerpt from the comment above mutex_lock(),
 * The mutex must later on be released by the same task that
 * acquired it. Recursive locking is not allowed. The task
 * may not exit without first unlocking the mutex. Also, kernel
 * memory where the mutex resides mutex must not be freed with
 * the mutex still locked. The mutex must first be initialized
 * (or statically defined) before it can be locked. memset()-ing
 * the mutex to 0 is not allowed.
