To add to that list, here at Purdue University, we actively look at crash
dumps on other architectures, such as IBM AIX, and are starting to do the
same on Linux machines, after discovery of LKCD.

This has much relevance for the standard kernel, as much relevance as gdb
has for people using applications.  While a majority of non-techno-geek
end-users probably don't care about the patch, I'm certain that there are
plenty of organizations out there like Purdue that WANT lkcd to become a
standard part of the Linux kernel.   Until then, we're forced to do our
own kernel patching every time we push out a new kernel.

We actively use it.

LKCD isn't a 'random new feature'.  It's something that is present in
nearly ever other "Unix" on the market. (Yes I know Unix != Linux).  It's
a feature that should have been integrated by now IMHO.

Again, we're the end-user, not the vendor, and we're trying to drive to
have it included.  I've talked with outher sys admins in my department
here at Purdue, and have gotten a unanimous response that "It would be a
good and useful feature to have."
