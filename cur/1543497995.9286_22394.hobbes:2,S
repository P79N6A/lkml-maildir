hpa:	I suspect that you're right -- and Ulrich seems to agree: it's
	easier to make glibc work using your convention; we can reassign
	the anonymous devices to another major (although that will break
	code looking for those.)  My suggestion, however, for the on-disk
	system, is the following:
	If the dev is too big for the current format, stick -1 in the 
	block pointer used by the current format, and use the N (for
	1 <= N <= 4, depending on the filesystem) subsequent block
	pointers to hold the real device number.)
	I suggest, as you say, a 32:32 split (it's simple).
