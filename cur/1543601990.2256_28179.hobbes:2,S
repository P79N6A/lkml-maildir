There is a patch which fixes problems such as this.  IIRC, it was
included in the upstream Linus kernel somewhere in April or
later.  If you're using XFree86 4.0.3, you'll probably want to
upgrade to a later kernel, or patch it with the r128 patch.  You
can get this patch from:
ftp://people.redhat.com/mharris/patches/linux-r128-drm.patch.bz2
I'd offer to change your mind for you, but I don't have a fresh diaper.
