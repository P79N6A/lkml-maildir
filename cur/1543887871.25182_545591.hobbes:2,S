If there are race issues involving concurrent invalidations, then you'd
fix that up by taking a filesystem specific lock to prevent them.
Generic write path should be holding i_mutex, but I don't think you can
take that from page_mkwrite... Just add one of your own.

No, you shouldn't. We could theoretically introduce a new API for this,
but I think it would be preferable if you can fix the race in the fs.
