It's not a lot of memory; it's one directory and a couple of files for
each PCI slot in the system.  Even huge systems have maybe 200 slots.
In order for this to take up as much as one page of ram on a typical PC
with six slots, this would have to consume 680 bytes per directory.  I
don't think sysfs is that inefficient (and if it is, maybe this feature
is not where the problem is, given the 'power' directory per device, the
19 files per scsi device, the huge numbers of symlinks, etc).
