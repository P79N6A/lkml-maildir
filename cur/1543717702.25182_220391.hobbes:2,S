Yes it fixes it. Thanks for the quick answer and sorry for the delay...
In the thread, other have reported the same problem with the Caps Lock 
key. Both keys have at least three things in common :
	1) They do no echo any character,
	2) They modify the interpretation of the next key pressed (change a 
keyboard status),
	3) They light up a led on the keyboard,
As the input handling logic has changed (if I remember correctly), the 
new logic (locking, signaling)  must be wrong for those keys...
Thanks for the quic way to reverse the faulty patch. Can now peacefully 
wait for the real fixe :-)
