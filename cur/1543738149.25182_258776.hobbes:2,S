It prevents a warning caused by calling
enable_irq() when the interrupt enable depth is already 0.
The maintainer added this call as part of a patch
that was meant to fix an unclaimed interrupt
during hardware initialization. He is
reworking the patch to do the correct thing.
You decided to keep the warning (and not apply
the e100 patch referenced in this thread) as an
indicator that a real fix is pending.
