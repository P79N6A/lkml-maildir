Javascript in Netscape uses the JVM a lot, and some of the Javascript
functions merely call Java classes to do their work.
So in effect, you are using Java if either language is enabled.
You can even call Java classes from Javascript.
Turn off both.  It worked for me.  Javascript only reduced the
frequency of errors, but it was still there.
Also, it cuts down on wasted CPU when some stupid WWW page runs
its annoying scripts endlessly.
