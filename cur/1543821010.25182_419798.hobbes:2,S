Now that unshare() exists, you're right, the current situation is just due to 
unshare() being an afterthought; the second form (clone() + unshare()) is 
actually more similar to the classical fork() API conceptually (i.e. you 
don't need a call with thousands of parameters to create a process, you can 
specify everything later).
So we get back to Eric's objection (which I haven't understood but that's my 
problem).
Additionally, if this flag ever goes into clone, it mustn't be named 
CLONE_TIME, but CLONE_NEWTIME (or CLONE_NEWUTS). And given CLONE_NEWNS, it's 
IMHO ok to have unshare(CLONE_NEWTIME) to mean "unshare time namespace", even 
if it's incoherent with unshare(CLONE_FS) - the incoherency already exists 
with CLONE_NEWNS.
