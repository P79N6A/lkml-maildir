Subject: [PATCH] x86: restrict keyboard io ports reservation to make ipmi driver work
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Helge Wagner <Helge.Wagner@gefanuc.com>
On some of our (single board computer) boards (x86) we are using an
IPMI controller that uses I/O ports 0x62 and 0x66 for a KCS (keyboard
controller style) IPMI system interface.
Trying to load the openipmi driver fails, because the ports
(0x62/0x66) are reserved for keyboard. keyboard reserves the full
range 0x60-0x6F while it doesn't need to.
Reserve only ports 0x60 and 0x64 for the legacy PS/2 i8042 keyboad
controller instead of 0x60-0x6F to allow the openipmi driver to work.
