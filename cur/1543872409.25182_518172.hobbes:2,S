I think it wasn't standard for real modems as they were full-duplex
(even these 1200/75 or what was that) but it was for other devices
such as current loops (which were frequently half-duplex).
I've seen such devices quite recently, perhaps ~ 10 years ago.
OTOH I think even "current" PC BIOSes use such signaling.

Sure. But /dev/ttyS* ports are full-duplex, with CRTSCTS or without,
so they don't use such handshaking.

I was thinking of a particular piece of hardware and it was definitely
broken a bit. "Selective compliance", maybe.

/proc is probably no-no.
For such signaling, it would perhaps be better to invent another flag,
similar to CRTSCTS. The driver would, of course, need some real code
for that.
