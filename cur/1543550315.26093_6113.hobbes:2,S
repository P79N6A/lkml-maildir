Does anyone actually want /proc/locks to stay?  The data structure
which allows it to be generated is now only used by the code to print
out /proc/locks.  If it could be deleted, a lot of code and data pointers
could go away.  I don't think any program depends on its existance and
it's a pretty ugly file anyway (exposing kernel pointers to userspace?
looks like pure debug code).
Speak now, or it shall be gone.
