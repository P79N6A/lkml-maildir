From a quick scan, the overall code quality is probably the best I've seen
for an initial submission of this magnitude.  I had a few minor issues and
questions, but it'd need a couple of hours to go through it all.
So.  Send 'em over when you're ready.
I have one concern.  If we merge this framework into mainline then we'd
(quite reasonably) expect to see an ongoing dribble of new controllers
being submitted.  But we haven't seen those controllers yet.  So there is a
risk that you'll submit a major new controller (most likely a net or memory
controller) and it will provoke a reviewer revolt.  We'd then be in a
situation of cant-go-forward, cant-go-backward.
It would increase the comfort level if we could see what the major
controllers look like before committing.  But that's unreasonable.
Could I ask that you briefly enumerate
a) which controllers you think we'll need in the forseeable future
b) what they need to do
c) pointer to prototype code if poss
Thanks.
