Heh. I am not expert, but I looked at the code. The obvious suspicious
thing to see is the use of unpaired barriers? Maybe like this:
 47 static void set_state(enum stopmachine_state newstate)
48 {
49         /* Reset ack counter. */
50         atomic_set(&thread_ack, num_threads);
51         smp_wmb();
+ /* force ordering between thread_ack/state */
52         state = newstate;
53 }
54
55 /* Last one to ack a state moves to the next state. */
56 static void ack_state(void)
57 {
58         if (atomic_dec_and_test(&thread_ack))
Maybe
+ /* force ordering between thread_ack/state */
+ smp_rmb();
here?
59                 set_state(state + 1);
60 }
61
Or maybe I am wrong. But Documentation/memory-barriers.txt is rather
explicit on this point.
