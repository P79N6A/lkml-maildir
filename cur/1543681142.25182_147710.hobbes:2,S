Your argument is bogus.  My first-hand experience is with IRC servers,
which customarily have thousands of connections at once, with a very
few percent active in a given check.  The scaling problem is not with
the length of waiting or how poll() is optimized -- it is with the
overhead *inherent* to processing poll().  Common IRC servers spend
100% of CPU when using poll() for only a few thousand clients.  Those
same servers, using FreeBSD's kqueue()/kevent() API, use well under
10% of the CPU.
Yes, the amount of time spent doing useful work increases as the
poll() load increases -- but the time wasted setting up and checking
activity for poll() is something you can never reclaim, and which only
goes up as your CPU gets faster.  epoll() makes you pay the cost of
updating the interest list only when the list changes; poll() makes
you pay the cost every time you call it.
Empirically, four of the five biggest IRC networks run server software
that prefers kqueue() on FreeBSD.  kqueue() did not cause them to be
large, but using kqueue() addresses specific concerns.  On the network
I can speak for, we look forward to having epoll() on Linux for the
same reason.

Your experience must be unique, because many people have seen poll()'s
inactive-client overhead cause CPU wastage problems on non-Linux OSes
(for me, FreeBSD and Solaris).
poll() may be badly implemented on Linux or not, but it shares a
design flaw with select(): that the application must specify the list
of FDs for each system call, no matter how few change per call.  That
is the design flaw that epoll() addresses.  If you truly believe that
poll()'s implementation is so flawed, please provide an improved
implementation.
To put it another way, all the optimizations in the world for a 'poll'
implementation won't sustain it unless you understand the flaw in its
specification.  The specification requires inefficient use of CPU for
very common situations.
