Why the hub driver?
For basic functionality, you simply power it down (doing virtual
unplug), and power it back up on resume (doing virtual plug of all
devices). That should work reasonably for everything but mass-storage.

Havin enough juice in "common case", but not in "worst case" is not

Yes.

Okay, but we need normal suspend/resume working first :-).
