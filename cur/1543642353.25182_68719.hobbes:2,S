Well, remember, he was going to use o_direct, so he can get away with pretty
crude locking.

He was going to go hack the vfs, so in his mind, practical issues of how the
vfs works now aren't an obstacle.  The only mistake he's making is seriously
underestimating how much effort is required to learn enough to do this kind
