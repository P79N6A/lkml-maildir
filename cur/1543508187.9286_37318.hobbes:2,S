OK, I picked the wrong word.  A thing that takes time out to save/restore
registers, does evil things to the TLB and the cache, etc.  It's worth
minimizing these if the cost of doing so isn't too high.

If you're saying that the arguments would look like a list of iovecs, yes 
to some extent.  There'd have to be another field in the descriptor to
specify *what* was wanted, since there'd be no ordering imposed on the
items you could ask for.  [Crowd murmurs:  he's a VMS-head, he's talking
about SYS$GETSYI()!  Stone him!]
If you're saying that one should just use readv on a handle to some /proc
file, no -- people play with the layout of /proc files all the time so
there's no good way to know what counts to put in the sortof-iovecs.  
(Now you know my "other reasons" for doing it this way.  You can't be
blindsided by encoding and formatting changes if there's no encoding or
formatting.)

A Brazil-nut is neatly packaged and tightly integrated.  To turn it into
food, you must crack and remove the shell.  I find that I feel the same   
way about an increasing number of software products.  *sigh*
