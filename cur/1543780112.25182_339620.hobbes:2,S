The situation in this case is somewhat obscene ... Originally, I had exactly
this problem while using the Knoppix standard kernel (2.6.11 vanilla SMP). I
then went to compile 2.6.12.3, also with SMP, and it showed exactly the same
problem. I disable SMP, tried again -- voila, it worked.
The kernel that I am encountering this error again now is 2.6.12.3 -- without
SMP or whatsoever. I'm just out of ideas on how to fix it this time.
