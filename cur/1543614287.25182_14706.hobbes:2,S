Nope it isn't that simple.  Multiboot doesn't extend gracefully at all,
not to multiple architectures, not to new parameters, not to multiple
vendors.   If you do extend it you get a real mess.
Which is why it is not good to adopt.

I've looked and I'm not going there.  Multiboot is just plain nasty,
and quite poorly specified as well.
I'll do something better but not that.  In fact I have already started...

GRUB allows some very neat things and it allows for it with the
multiboot stuff.  And everyone seems to assume that because what you
can do with GRUB is good, multiboot must be good as well.  But have
you ever wondered why no other bootloader implementor was interested?
