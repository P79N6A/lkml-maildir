Well, if you do this, then you can pretty much delete the whole quirk
table we have, right?
And personally, I want to do better than Windows XP when it comes to
power management.  This patch is only going to suspend a very tiny
subset of devices, including a whole bunch of ones that do not even have
drivers in Linux, causing our power footprint to be bigger than needed.
Also, we have udev rules for SANE that disables their autosuspend
settings, which handles the majority of the devices we have seen with
problems.
So I really don't want to accept this patch.  But, what problems are you
seeing with our current suspend logic that you feel we need to be this
harsh?
thanks,
