>My PAS-16 is pre-ISA-PnP, so it doesn't get configured,
Being pre-ISApnp is an advantage the way I see it.  That
means it don't mess up like pnp may do. Less automatic, but
no trouble once you get it working the first time.

2.3.51 is very different from 2.2.14.  Modular pas-16 works fine for me,
it even saves memory as the sound stuff unloads when not in use. 
Reloading doesn't seem to be a problem for this driver.
