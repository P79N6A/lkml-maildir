As I understand it, the build problem was triggered
when the waitid-system-call.patch from Roland McGrath
and the bk-ia64.patch time interpolation logic patch
from Cristoph Lameter were applied.
But the cause itself, as Roland pointed, is the fact
that the asm-ppc/io.h includes linux/mm.h, unlike
other platforms (that's why the build problem only
affected ppc).
This seems to be unnecessary. At least, confirmation
for this exists for some embedded ppc ports (me) and
the PowerMac (Joseph).

IIRC, the linus tree also includes linux/mm.h in
asm-ppc/io.h since several versions.
