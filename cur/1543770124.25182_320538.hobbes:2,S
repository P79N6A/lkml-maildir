Hi,
at first - please excuse my bad english. Here is my ?bug report? and
a ?possible solution.?
[1.] One line summary of the problem:    
Risk of a froozen system loading stallion-module and no funktion
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
I wanted to use a Stallion EC 8/64 PCI card. After loading the kernel-
module with "modprobe stallion" i tried to echo a text to one of the serial
devices ( echo "Hello World" >/dev/ttyE0 ). The tty is not opened and 
no characters are sent. (I am sure it is not a handshake problem) 
After doing that two, three or more times the complete system stalled.
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
2.6.10
2.6.11.9
both compiled as non-smp-kernels because of cli() / sti()
[5.] Output of Oops.. message (if applicable) with symbolic information 
     resolved (see Documentation/oops-tracing.txt)
none
[6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the
     problem (if possible)
modprobe stallion
echo "Hello World" >/dev/ttyE0
[7.] Environment
[7.1.] Software (add the output of the ver_linux script here)
[7.2.] Processor information (from /proc/cpuinfo):
I tested it at different Systems with different Pentium III/4 CPU's
[7.3.] Module information (from /proc/modules):
[7.4.] Loaded driver and hardware information (/proc/ioports, /proc/iomem)
[7.5.] PCI information ('lspci -vvv' as root)
[7.6.] SCSI information (from /proc/scsi/scsi)
[7.7.] Other information that might be relevant to the problem
       (please look in /proc and include all information that you
       think to be relevant):
[X.] Other notes, patches, fixes, workarounds:
This patch shows you how i tryed to fix this problem
