  just to be clear, all that script is doing is identifying variables
of the form "CONFIG_fubar" that are being tested in *some*
preprocessor directive somewhere in the tree, but for which there is
apparently no corresponding entry in a Kconfig file anywhere that
could cause that variable to be configured.
  naturally, as geert suggests, this might represent a feature that's
in progress so it's clearly not a mistake.  but it's a good way to
trap potential problems, as in finding "GALILLEO_GT64240_ETH" which,
superficially, would seem like an obvious typo no matter what:
$ grep -r GALILLEO_GT64240_ETH .
./arch/mips/momentum/ocelot_g/prom.c:#ifdef CONFIG_GALILLEO_GT64240_ETH
./arch/mips/momentum/ocelot_g/prom.c:#ifdef CONFIG_GALILLEO_GT64240_ETH
./arch/mips/momentum/ocelot_g/setup.c:#ifdef CONFIG_GALILLEO_GT64240_ETH
./arch/mips/momentum/ocelot_g/setup.c:#ifdef CONFIG_GALILLEO_GT64240_ETH
$
as well as what is *obviously* dead code:
$ grep -rw CONFIG_KERNELD .
./sound/core/timer.c:#ifdef CONFIG_KERNELD
$ grep -rw KERNELD .
./net/core/dev.c: *             Bjorn Ekwall    :       Added KERNELD hack.
  the script isn't perfect -- it will generate false positives if the
variable is being set elsewhere -- perhaps hardcoded in the file or
defined in a Makefile.  but if you're curious, just run it against
your favourite subdirectory and see what comes up.
