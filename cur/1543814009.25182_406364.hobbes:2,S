i think we've talked about your specific case before, and lets not drop 
it on the floor. IIRC you have some special workload (driven by serial 
lines?) which behaves interactively and which thus gets too much 
boosting.
the passive methods: did you try to mute its impact by renicing it to +5 
or +10? If you know that a workload is not interactive, despite it 
behaving so, you can always prevent it from getting too much attention.  
There's also SCHED_BATCH in 2.6.16-ish kernels.
and there are some active methods as well: you might want to try Mike 
Galbraith's scheduler throttling feature:

(which we could try in -mm too perhaps, perhaps Mike has an updated 
patch for 2.6.16-rc6-mm1?)
