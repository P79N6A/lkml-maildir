I'm sorry, but I'm still not getting the point:
Which part of this task is technically impossible to implement through a 
userspace daemon?

I'm still not understanding the big improvements when doing it in the 
kernel instead of doing it in a userspace daemon.

The only point in this lwn article that is not solvable outside of the 
kernel is if distributions want to prevent loading of modules they 
haven't authorized.
The lwn article outlines how distributions can use this for demanding 
money from module vendors. Distributions can do this if they want to, 
but this is nothing we should add a single byte of code for.
