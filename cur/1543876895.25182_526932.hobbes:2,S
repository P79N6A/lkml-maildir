Not really.  The threshold below which glibc does not give memory
back to the kernel at all is dynamic already.  It is entirely
possible to make an application that frees tens of thousands of
3000 byte chunks, in a pattern that makes it impossible for glibc
to return any memory to the kernel.
If you want to run without overcommit, don't run too close to the
wire :)
