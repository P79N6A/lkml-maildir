Are you sure? How did this ever work?
Also, looking at this, I think the "how did this ever work" question is 
answered by "it didn't", but I also think there are still serious problems 
there. Look at
	again:
	        mutex_lock(&old_parent->d_inode->i_mutex);
	        if (!mutex_trylock(&new_parent->d_inode->i_mutex)) {
	                mutex_unlock(&old_parent->d_inode->i_mutex);
	                goto again;
	        }
and wonder what happen sif old_parent == new_parent. Is that trying to 
avoid an ABBA deadlock? Normally you'd do it by ordering the locks, or by 
taking a third lock to guarantee serialization at a higher level (ie the 
"s_vfs_rename_mutex" on the VFS layer)
I'd like to apply these two patches, but I really want to get more of an 
ack for them from somebody like Al, or at least more of an explanation for 
why it's all the right thing.
