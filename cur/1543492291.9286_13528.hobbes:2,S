ICMP route redirect has nothing to do with the route daemon, it is generated
on Unix systems by the Kernel (on Linux only when it is not configured
as a router, as per RFC1812)
Usually it happens when you have missing routes to some box on the same network
and your default gateway is misconfigured and issues redirects.
In general you're right though, dynamic routing (routed) on non-router boxes
does usually more harm than good, with the exception of router discovery.
