The point of the merge review is that people who are familiar with the existing
Linux code double check that the way your code interfacts
with the rest of the kernel is sane, does not have obvious bugs and follows the 
existing good practice. 
Once the code is in mainline it will get maintained and fixed when needed, 
but to make this possible without undue work on the mainline hackers it is needed
to do a full review first. 
AFAIK reiserfs has not gotten such a full review yet.
Also good reviewers are rare so it is not a good idea to be picky here.

Someone qualified to review a new file system for inclusion will have need necessary 
some experience in Linux file systems, and that can be hardly gotten without ever 
having touched one.  So you will have to live with other file system authors 
commenting on your code.
The main philosophy that is of concern here is also the philosophy of the 
core VFS and other kernel interfaces.

Nobody doubts that you are active. Just there are doubts that your
code follows the Linux coding standards enough to not be a undue
mainteance burden in mainline.  A review with the following changes
could probably fix that.
