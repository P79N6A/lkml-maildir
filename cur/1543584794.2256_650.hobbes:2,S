Do you have CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SIS5513 and autotuning enabled at the
same time? Unless I enable them both it works flawlessly for me too - up
to UDMA33. In fact, I've never seen any docs claiming the 5591/5513 would
even provide UDMA66 support. How do you program the controler to do UDMA66
cycles?
Anyway, might be interesting to have a look at your lspci -d:5513 -vvvxxx
report from working UDMA33/66 setups!
