Needless to say that USB is currently broken for the architectures that
need pci_alloc_consistent.
A while ago, I looked at what was required to convert the OHCI driver
to pci_alloc_consistent, and it turns out that the current interface is
highly sub-optimal.  It looks good on the face of it, but it _really_
does need sub-page allocations to make sense for USB.
At the time, I didn't feel like creating a custom sub-allocator just
for USB, and since then I haven't had the inclination nor motivation
to go back to trying to get my USB mouse or iPAQ communicating via USB.
(I've not used this USB port for 3 years anyway).
I'd be good to get it done "properly" at some point though.
