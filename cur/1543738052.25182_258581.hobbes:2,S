Still haven't full source so this is still guess work.
But assuming it is a character device, did you forget to add an owner
field to the file ops structure?
static struct file_operations xxx_fops = {
	.owner	= THIS_MODULE,
	.read	= my_read,
...
The owner field is used by the character device layer to maintain module
ref counts in 2.6.
