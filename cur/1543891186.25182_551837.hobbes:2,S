Will do. This function is called when we want to move a page in
the LRU list. This could happen when a page is activated or when
reclaim finds that a particular page cannot be reclaimed right now.

Yes, correct.

Yes, before a page is reclaimed from the global LRU list, we go through
page_remove_rmap() in try_to_unmap(). Pages are removed from the container
LRU before they are reclaimed.

The lock needs to be interrupt safe.

We discussed this on lkml. Basically, now for every zone we try to reclaim
pages from the container, it increases CPU utilization if we choose the wrong
zone to reclaim from, but it provides the following benefit
Code reuse (shrink_zone* is reused along with helper functions). I am not sure
if Pavel had any other benefits in mind like benefits on a NUMA box.

node_zonelists[ZONE_NORMAL].zones should contain ZONE_DMA and ZONE_DMA32 right?
