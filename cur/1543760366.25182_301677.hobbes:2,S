I'm not sure i understand but i've just tried to read the code and it
looks like the IP address is the address of the other end of a socket.
This address is set when a process does accept(). So this user IP we are
talking about would be the remote users host IP (or gateway in case of
NAT). 
I don't think i fully understand the code but it looks like it only
holds the remote IP address of the last accept()-ed connection.
