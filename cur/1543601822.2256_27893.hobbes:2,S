        Hello folks ac12-preempt popped with a new issue:
    strange it is or not, but i cant start mc since it hangs
  in random places (as strace shows).
  	Except my thought that its preempt-unrelated there isnt
  much to add. Btw console losing issues are back... grr... :(
        Even glibc/mc recompilation seems not to help...
cheers, Samium Gromoff
