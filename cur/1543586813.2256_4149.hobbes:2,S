BTW, my 2.4.3-pre8 kernel just said
| sym53c875-0:0: ERROR (81:0) (3-21-0) (10/9d) @ (script 8a8:0b000000).
| sym53c875-0: script cmd = 11000000
| sym53c875-0: regdump: da 10 80 9d 47 10 00 0d 00 03 80 21 80 01 09 09 00 30 4e 00 08 ff ff ff.
| sym53c875-0-<0,*>: FAST-20 WIDE SCSI 40.0 MB/s (50.0 ns, offset 16)
during the boot process, and continued without problems. What does this mean?
