   Probably this belongs under 8. I posted a patch a few days ago.
Thanks for the update.  When the patch gets accepted into the mainline
kernel, would you mind dropping me a note?  I do try to scan Linus
announcements, but I sometimes miss matching a bug report with his patch
summaries, and it's a lot easier if I get an explicit notification from
the patch author.  Thanks!!
