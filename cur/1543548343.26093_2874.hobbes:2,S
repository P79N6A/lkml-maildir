Many people have asked for the script, my initial list, and the raw
results from the current run.
I've made them available here:
http://www.gurulabs.com/ecn-check.tar.bz2
  (367KB)
It took 12 hours to check the list.
It would pretty easy to automatically email a message to the broken sites.
Which firewalls are causing the problem (Cisco PIX, at least, although it
is interesting that www.cisco.com is reachable.  Are they not running a
PIX?)?  Have any firewall vendors released patches or fixes?  Which
firewalls can be manually configured to allow ECN packets?
It would be very nice if the email sent included such pointers and
information.
If you have any information, send it to me and I'll create a draft email.  
I'll run it by l-k for any comments, and then send it to ECN blocking
sites.
