not your fault at all - i cleaned this up in my tree so that only valid
combinations can be selected, these fixes will show up in -U4.
it seems that SMP + PREEMPT_TIMING is not stable though, somehow the
latency printk's cause a crash sooner or later. I'm still debugging this
problem. Without PREEMPT_TIMING the SMP kernel is stable.
