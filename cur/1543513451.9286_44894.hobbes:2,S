Pcmcia now uses the linux kernel resource management. This left in a lot
of code that is really redundant. I made a patch that cleans some of
that and also fixes other problems (for me, at least).
+	Remove some of the redundant code. Mainly the io_list resources were
	always checked but nobody used that for actual allocation.
+	Code like
		if(check_region(...) == 0) {
			request_region();
			return 0;
		}
	changed to
		if(request_region(...)) {
			return 0;
		}
+	Do not Do not ignore req->Size if we have SS_CAP_MEM_ALIGN (fixes
	ibmtr_cs mmiobase alignment problem).
+	"make modules_install" does not look for the missing pcmcia.o.
Patch is against kernel 2.3.23-pre2. You can find it in
