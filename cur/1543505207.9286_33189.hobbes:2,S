Yes, it seems to be. Linux didn't recognize the partition tables
on those 3 disks. Linux recognizes DOS like partitions
(by default) and optionally BSD, Mac, SMB, Solaris,
SGI and Unixware (kernel build options).

If you don't care about the current contents of those
disks then the answer is simple:
# fdisk /dev/sda
followed by /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc to write DOS like partitions
on those disks. After that use mke2fs to place file
systems in those partitions ...
