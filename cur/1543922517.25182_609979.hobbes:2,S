I couldn't seem to find much documentation on this. For the archive and
to confirm we're talking about the same thing, you mean:
echo 10 > /proc/PID/oom_adj
(and ulimit/setrlimit for the resource limits) ?
This assumes I know in advance which processes are likely to go mad
which isn't ideal although it could solve my immediate problem.

Its certainly another option but other processes then suffer because
certain applications have bugs in them?
