A program that does a flush ioctl on a block device:
open("/dev/hda", O_RDONLY)              = 3
ioctl(3, BLKFLSBUF, 0)                  = 0

I'm using an initrd (but no pivot_root) that initializes my LVM2 volumes
(using device-mapper).
/boot and / are on device-mapper devices.

I'll try to find out what happens. Not interested in crashing my system
while answering emails now. ;)
