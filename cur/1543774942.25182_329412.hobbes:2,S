This is queued in -mm:
From: "KAMBAROV, ZAUR" <kambarov@berkeley.edu>
The length of the array desc->bitmap is 3, and not 4:
Definitions involved:
In drivers/usb/core/hcd.h
464  	#define bitmap 	DeviceRemovable
In drivers/usb/host/ohci-hub.c
395  		struct usb_hub_descriptor	*desc
In drivers/usb/core/hub.h
130  	struct usb_hub_descriptor {
131  		__u8  bDescLength;
132  		__u8  bDescriptorType;
133  		__u8  bNbrPorts;
134  		__u16 wHubCharacteristics;
135  		__u8  bPwrOn2PwrGood;
136  		__u8  bHubContrCurrent;
137  		    	/* add 1 bit for hub status change; round to bytes */
138  		__u8  DeviceRemovable[(USB_MAXCHILDREN + 1 + 7) / 8];
139  		__u8  PortPwrCtrlMask[(USB_MAXCHILDREN + 1 + 7) / 8];
140  	} __attribute__ ((packed));
In include/linux/usb.h
306  	#define USB_MAXCHILDREN		(16)
This defect was found automatically by Coverity Prevent, a static analysis
tool.
(akpm: this code should be shot.  Field `bitmap' doesn't exist in struct
usb_hub_descriptor.  And this .c file is #included in
drivers/usb/host/ohci-hcd.c, and someone somewhere #defines `bitmap' to
`DeviceRemovable'.
From a maintainability POV it would be better to memset the whole array
beforehand - I changed the patch to do that)
