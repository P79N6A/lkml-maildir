Actually, I think I've found a problem: e2comp appears to lock up the
system when used with loop mounted file systems, although whether the
problem is with e2comp or the loop filesystem is currently unknown.
Try the following...
 Q> cd /tmp
 Q> dd if=/dev/zero bs=1024 count=256 of=test.img
 Q> mke2fs test.img
 Q> mkdir test
 Q> mount -o loop,rw test.img test
 Q> cd test
 Q> chattr +c .
...and then create a file therein. At least with 2.2.14, the system
locks solid on me. I'll have a look at this tomorrow and see whether I
can work out what's going on here.
Best wishes from Riley.
