this is what the lo* patches address, by providing
the required loopback isolation and providing lo
inside a guest (i.e. it looks and feels like a
normal system, except that you cannot modify the
interfaces from inside)

no, it _alway_ binds to INADDR_ANY and checks
against other sockets (in the same context)
comparing the lists of assigned IPs (the subset)
so all checks happen at bind/connect time and
always against the set of IPs, only exception is
a performance optimization we do for single IP
guests (where INADDR_ANY gets rewritten to the
single IP)
