Subject says it all...  It has some type of crystal codec in the speakerbox. 
This is on a force sparc10 board.  AFAI can tell, it's using the audio via
the isdn chip.  The box pops when loading dbri, but nothing more happens.
Any ideas?  (I'd like to get it working, other wise I'll have to sell the
box.)
