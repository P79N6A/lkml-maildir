Well, I went to bed shortly after my missive :-)

Hm. I got testy because there were three broken things I stumbled over
in 12 hours. I think this just highlights the need for BitKeeper or
equivalent, where automated regression testing (even a simple "does it
compile and link?") is performed, and if the test fails, it gets
bounced and doesn't even get to Linus.
Alan: I realise it's impractical for you to manually test each
patchlet that you send to Linus, since you carry a large number of
them. But would you consider an automated system? I'm thinking of a
script that you use to "mail" each patch to Linus. Said script applies
and compiles, and either bounces the patch, or sends it off the Linus.
That way you get the same fire-and-forget behaviour you have now with
email, but with better testing.
