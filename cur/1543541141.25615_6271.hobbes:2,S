Cute, if somewhat sick.
It'd be far nicer to use ramfs, though. What I'd like to do is compile a
statically-linked combination of tar(1) and rz(1), which will untar the
tarball it receives into a fresh ramfs.
Q: If you don't have initrd, where do you put this binary? 
A: In the kernel. Provide it with a set of pages which are to be put into 
the user-space side of process #1, rather then exec'ing /sbin/init.
Also cute, and definitely sicker :)
