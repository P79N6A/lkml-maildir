I would just remove it. If the limit is wrong, we crash again. And the 
realtime guys already are pissed off by batch=10000 anyway.

Absolutely. Keeping a count of (percpu) queued items is basically free if kept 
in the cache line used by list head, so the 'queue length on this cpu' is a 
cheap metric.
A 'realtime refinement' would be to use a different maxbatch limit depending 
on the caller's priority : Let a softirq thread have a lower batch count than 
a regular user thread.
