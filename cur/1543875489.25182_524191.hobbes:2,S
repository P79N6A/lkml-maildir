I wasn't aware of that.

The devices are expected (and in fact required) not to generate interrupts
and not to do any DMA transfers after they have been frozen.

I think this is doable.

In the suspend to disk context we must ensure that the other CPUs won't
modify memory in any way while the image is being created, so I think we
should at least make them loop in a safe place and refuse to take any
interrupts.

I'm not sure what you mean.
Anyway, currently cpu_up() is used to enable the other CPUs when we have
finished with the image (as well as during the resume).

Well, we've been using it for suspending SMP boxes for quite some time now
and there haven't been any major low-level problems.  The current problems are
related to the fact that the CPU hotplug calls lots of notifiers that need not
run during the suspend or resume (or in power_down() for that matter).

I'm not sure if we have to.  On x86_* we cannot turn the 1st CPU off anyway.

Thanks a lot for the info.
The patch looks a bit too complicated for a quick fix.  I think we'll need to
remove that WARN_ON() in 2.6.21 after all.
