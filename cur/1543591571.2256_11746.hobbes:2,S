I tried to imply that through the use of the the word component.  Yes,
they're independant, but the code is pretty meaningless without a
demonstration of how it's used. ;-)

root= becomes a parameter to mount, and initrd becomes mandatory.  I'd be
all for including all of the bits needed to build the initrd boot code in
the tree, but it's completely in the air.

It's not done yet, but similar techniques would be applied.  I envision
that a raid device would support operations such as
open("/dev/md0/slot=5,hot-add=/dev/sda")

Good.  Less work to do.

I'd just create a symlink to /dev/hda1 at mount time, although that really
isn't what the user wants to see: the label or uuid is more useful.
