That's half of it. Creating something oftenly goes along with copying
parts of other things. Without the idea of version control (which you
for sure didn't invent) BK wouldn't be there. Distributed repositories
aren't that new, too. For example, I'm using rsync'ed CVS repositories
since quite some time...
So creating and copying are quite connected to each other...
