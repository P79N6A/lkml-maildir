Hi Jesper,
> There's a problem in drivers/bluetooth/dtl1_cs.c::dtl1_hci_send_frame()
> 
> If bt_skb_alloc() returns NULL, then skb_reserve(s, NSHL); will cause a
> NULL pointer deref - ouch.
> If we can't allocate the resources we require we need to tell the caller
> by returning -ENOMEM.

> Found by the coverity checker as bug #409
> 
> Patch is compile tested, but that's all, due to lack of hardware.
