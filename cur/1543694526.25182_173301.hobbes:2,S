If you turn on debugging for the parser in namedev.c by uncommenting the
comment at the top of the file:
/* define this to enable parsing debugging */
/* #define DEBUG_PARSER */
to look like:
/* define this to enable parsing debugging */
#define DEBUG_PARSER
It will give you a lot of information about what the parser is reading,
and trying to match up with your device.  If you could send me the
system debug log from when you plug in your device with the DEBUG_PARSER
define enabled, I'd be glad to look into it.

No, I think I broke the partition logic somewhere.  I think the name of
the first partition in this case should be "usb_disk1".  Yeah, it's a
hack for now, hopefully some new libsysfs changes in regards to the
block sysfs tree will help out with this (it's really hard to determine
the partition is different from the main block device right now in
udev.)
Ah, yeah, udev seg faults right now for partitions.  Let me try to track
down the bug, give me a bit of time...
thanks for letting me know,
