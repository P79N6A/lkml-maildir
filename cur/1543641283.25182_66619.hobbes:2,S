Nobody seems to have a solution and I figure that these chipsets (VIA
Technologies, Inc. VT82C585VP + VT82C586/A/B) are buggy. However,
kernel 2.2.19 works fine, 2.4 doesn't at all.
And -d1 -u1 gives 1.1MB/s, -d0 -u1 gives 3.5M/s, which seems funny.
Can someone please say where exactly the problem is, and which part of
the kernel deals with it? The IDE driver? The timer? How would I go
about fixing it again?
These machines are supposed to make good firewalls!
Thanks all,
Volker
