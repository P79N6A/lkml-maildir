I have not been intending to argue but to point out short comings.

I think we have a different conception of where the problems lie.
The easy cases I see are everything as a unit, or everything as
separate pieces.  I do not see natural connection between namespaces
that will help us out.

I agree we incremental development is good and what we need.
The hard part is that we can never undo any part of our user interface.
So we must have complete an sane semantics when we implement a namespace,
before it gets merged anywhere beyond a purely development tree.
Then in addition to that usually you find that the existing implementation
does not have a good 1-1 change and must be refactored and have the cruft
removed before you can start extending it.
