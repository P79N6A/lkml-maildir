I'm looking at the code, and I'm completely failing to see your point.
Exactly how is that scheme incompatible with use of wait_queue_t?
AFAICS You grab the wait_queue_t lock once in down()/__mutex_lock()
order to try to take the lock (or queue the waiter if that fails), then
once more in order to pass the mutex on to the next waiter on
up()/mutex_unlock(). That is more or less the exact same thing I was
doing with iosems using bog-standard waitqueues, and which Ben has
adapted to his mutexes. What am I missing?
One of the motivations for doing that as far as the iosems were
concerned, BTW, was to avoid adding to this ecology of functionally
identical structures that we have for semaphores, rwsems, and wait
queues.
Cheers,
