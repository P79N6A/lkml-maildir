Subject: [PATCH] consolidate generic peices of the siginfo structures and associated stuff
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch creates asm-generic/siginfo.h and uses it to remove a
lot of duplicate code in the various asm-*/siginfo.h files.  Some
if it is a little ugly, but I think it will be worth it just to
help us eliminate some of the bugs that have come from code copying.
