X servers talking directly to frame buffers generally use code that is 
generated directly from some very "interesting" macros, that is carefull 
about alignment issues in the first place.  The portable X frame buffer 
code is one of the more interesting pieces of code around, particularly 
once you realize the same source file generates a bunch of other .c files 
that actually do the work.  They certainly do not do function calls (or 
even invoke other macros) to "do the right thing".

Lesser of several evils; putting all the graphics code required in a window 
system into the kernel is much worse (particularly due to the schedular 
problems it would generate; a bit blit of a large area of the screen is 
not something you want to do without pre-emption).  People went there 
in the 1980's, tried it, and didn't like it...  The graphics performance 
requirements are also very high; the system call boundary is a problem.
I've never seen it as a real problem from an architecture point of view
that certain hardware may be mapped where user space programs can access
it directly, presuming the hardware itself is not going to compromise the
integrity of the system (certainly true for alot of graphics hardware).
But then again, I'm biased...
