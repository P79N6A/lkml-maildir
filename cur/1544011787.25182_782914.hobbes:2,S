There's another reason this is really useful.
If something goes wrong, remotely debugging a users initrd right is
a lot easier if you know what it looks like.  Right now, in Fedora for eg,
where we generate an initrd for each users system at runtime, we need
to get a copy of the generated initrd, and pull it apart just to find
out what modules ended up in there, what didn't, and then somehow
try to work backwards to try and figure out how the generator got into
that state.  After doing this for five years, let me tell you it's
_really_ _really_ painful.

At least in theory, with a kernel-event/udev driven system, the additional
modules shouldn't cause any additional boot time. There wouldn't be
events generated to cause them to be loaded, so they'd just be taking
up space.  And the additional load time for a bigger initrd should be
really lost in the noise of the overall boot.
