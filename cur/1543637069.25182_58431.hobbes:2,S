The TCP window scaling option is something else. You are correct,
however, that 2.4 manages receiver side buffers differently and
therefore advertises differently. This is designed to save buffer memory
in a HTTP server and should actually be good for your application.

Correct.

Again, don't think so. Unless Alexey has changed something recently,
Linux quickacks every full sized segment immediately during the
slowstart phase. This means that, in the beginning, the congestion
window is growing as fast as the specs allow. 
If in doubt, you can set the TCP_NODELAY option. Just make sure your app
is sending full sized segments if you do this, otherwise it will just
degrade performance. 
Anyway, try posting some hard data. Maybe somebody on these lists can
figure it out.
