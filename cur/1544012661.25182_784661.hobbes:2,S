	x86_64, so it's not applicable.
	I see you've included XFS guys, but that's hard to guess which
sub-system is related to that crash, cause it's a stacked construction
XFS/LVM-2/Linux Software RAID/sata_nv. Also, I've found there were
some complaints bout netfilter's ipt_recent, which I was using, so
I've decided to turn it off and see.

	Yeah, I'll try to get backtraces, using null-modem cable, but alas, I
don't have it yet. Nowadays it's not a thing easy to buy at a computer
store. Also, my message (feedback) was written due to concerns bout
quality degradation I saw. May be I was mistaken or not, but I felt
it's better to talk about it to people who really cared and knew.
