OK, so Microsoft has thrown down the gauntlet. Some of the things they say 
are completely untrue ("Security on linux is all-or-none", apparently they 
never heard of "sudo" before), but some of the issues they bring up are valid.
Perhaps someone more knowledgeable in the matter should prepare a detailed 
response?
