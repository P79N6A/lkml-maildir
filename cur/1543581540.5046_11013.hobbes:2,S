Hello,
    I received the following while compiling 2.4.1-ac10:
...
make[3]: *** No rule to make target '/usr/src/linux/drivers/pci/devlist.h', needed by names.o'. Stop
make[3]: Leaving directory '/usr/src/linux/drivers/pci'
make[2]: *** [first_rule] Error 2
...
I haven't looked into it, but the addition was between 2.4.1-ac9 and 2.4.1-ac10. 2.4.2-pre3 didn't have this problem.
Regards,
Frank
