i'm not sure what you mean. Here's the relevant 4:4 code from Fedora:
#define __SWITCH_KERNELSPACE                            \
...
        movl %edx, %cr3;                                \
        movl %ebx, %esp;                                \
i.e. we _first_ load cr3 with the kernel pagetable value, then do we
switch esp to the real kernel stack.
