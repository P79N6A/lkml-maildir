What is the minimum amount of memory we need to reserve for each
socket?  1K? 1 page?  Call it X
Suppose that whenever a socket is created (or bound or connected or
whatever is right) we first allocate that much to a recv pool.
If any socket has less than X queued, then it is allowed to allocate
up to a total of X from the reserve pool.  After that it can only
receive when memory can be allocated from elsewhere.  Then we will
never block on recv.
Note that X doesn't need to be the biggest possible incoming message.
It only needs to be enough to get an 'ack' over any possible network
storage protocol with any possible layering. I suspect that it well
within one page.
Would it be too much waste to reserve one page for every idle socket? 
Does this have some fatal flaw?
