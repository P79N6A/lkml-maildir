Yes.  There are some bugs in the SCSI async-scanning code, and there is
a patch to fix them:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/jejb/scsi-misc-2.6.git;a=commit;h=a93a091df8232fad60867d41fbc3be855a0b78f2
It is scheduled for 2.6.24.  For now, people can work around the bug by 
disabling CONFIG_SCSI_SCAN_ASYNC.

I have urged both James Bottomley and Andrew Morton to apply that patch 
as soon as possible.  Neither of them paid any attention.
