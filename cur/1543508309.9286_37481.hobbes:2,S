The CD-ROM problem is not as big as it sounds and is easily fixable
(either the kernel or the programs). The problems you are seeing
are caused by Uniform CD-ROM interface completely failing blocking
opens on non-data CD's. Either patch the application to open
the device O_NONBLOCK or load cdrom.o with check_media_type=0.
I think I'll let it default to 0 again (which it did prior to
2.3.15).
