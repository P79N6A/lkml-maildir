Thanks for extensive report. The only thing I can say in a short time space at 
the pc is that SCHED_BATCH as defined by Ingo in the current mainline kernel, 
which if I am to abide by in SD, means "I want the same total cpu percentage 
as other tasks at this nice level but I am latency insensitive". ie it is not 
the "idle priority" type of SCHED_BATCH. That sort of thing is implemented 
in -ck as SCHED_IDLEPRIO. If I have pc time and health I'll be reimplementing 
it for -ck when it moves to the SD scheduler.
