CodingStyle is not the end-all of rulebooks.  See repeated messages by 
Linus, me, and others on the subject.  CodingStyle intentionally does 
not list a rule for every possible C code incarnation.
It's the general style to avoid these return statements in new code.  It 
makes the page longer, meaning less code to review.  It tends to trip up 
people making bombing runs through drivers, and searching for return 
statements in their favorite editor.
If you consider how many void functions there are in the kernel, 1354 is 
the obvious minority, being far smaller than "millions."  Please follow 
what -millions- of void functions already do in the kernel.

incorrect.  a space goes there, as I put it.

ditto.
