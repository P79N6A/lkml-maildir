Okay, this means the lock is being set by the BIOS, which disallows
disabling BIOS (and thus accessing the FWH). By default, I think it
is correct to consider the RNG not present in this case, however as
previously indicated I think we should provide a way to force
skipping the FWH test (with three levels - carry out, skip always, or
skip if BIOS locked).
I'll prepare a patch as soon as I can, but it might take a few days
until I get to it.
