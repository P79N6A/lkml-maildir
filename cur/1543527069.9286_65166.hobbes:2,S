oh, it is very different - that's the whole point of the enhancements I
made to it :), i.e. it creates a separate ELF segment for each vmalloc'd
(but *not* ioremap'd) area created which makes the heading portion of
variable size. This is useful if you have a -g compiled kernel to do:
 gdb vmlinux /proc/kcore
so you can analyze the structure on live kernel even including the
module's address space (because of vmalloc support).

Tigran.
