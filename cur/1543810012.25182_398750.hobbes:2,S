I'd let someone else judge, but that is clearly a broken case that just 
has to be declared broken. <joke>could you please also adapt to a font 
that has all glyphs looking as smileys?</joke> But it's only three extra 
lines of code, so let's accept that "c<128" check.

This doesn't match the behaviour of X.

I agree that, in some cases, it makes sense to copy and paste 
undisplayable glyphs. However, IMHO, this should not be allowed for 
malformed sequences.
