Sorry about the multiple submissions. Seems when you're updating the
documentation, there is always that one more correction to be made.
Changes are from the 2.2.13 Documentation/pci.txt, assumes you haven't
applied my previous patch.
Added information about correctly accessing PCI I/O and memory space. Added
information about PCI interrupts and request_irq(). Added reference to
Documentation/IO-mapping.txt file.
My thanks to Jeff Garzik for acting as an informal editor.
Let me know if the patch doesn't apply cleanly.

  config space. You should use the values in the pci_dev structure as they might
  have been remapped by the kernel.
  
+    If your PCI device uses PCI I/O space, you need to use the check_region(),
+ request_region() and release_region() routines. These prevent devices from 
+ having conflicting I/O regions. You access your registers using the inb(),
+ inw(), inl(), outb(), outw(), or outl() routines passing the value of
+ (struct pci_dev *) dev->base_address[] masked by PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_IO_MASK
+ as the base address of your registers.
+ 
+    If your PCI device uses PCI memory space, use ioremap() to create a cookie 
+ mapping to your PCI device. The mask (struct pci_dev *) dev->base_address[] 
+ with PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_MEM_MASK before passing it into ioremap(). This cookie 
+ is passed to the readb(), readw(), readl(), writeb(), writew(), and writel() 
+ routines when accessing PCI space. You must always use these routines when 
+ accessing PCI space from the kernel. Not all architectures allow direct access
+ to PCI memory space from the kernel.
+ 
+    The IO-mapping.txt file has information about converting between the
+ various address spaces. People writing DMA device drivers should pay special
+ attention to this information.
+ 
+    PCI interrupt routines are always SA_SHIRQ and should use the value from
+ (struct pci_dev *) dev->irq field for the interrupt number passed into 
+ request_irq(). Since it is a shared interrupt, you must also always pass a 
+ unique dev_id to request_irq().
