Oleg's suggestion about MPS didn't work, but it was fun. Instead of dying
instantly, a USB mouse pauses about 9 times before it finally halts. The
device in dmesg also disconnects/reconnects 9 times before it is unable to
assign a device number again to the mouse. PS/2 still locks the entire
machine. Loading and unloading usb-uhci.o does reinitialize the USB mouse
for a while, so it is fixable w/o rebooting.
This is also interesting. You appear to not have the strange ACPI device
at hardware interrupt 9 that I do. While the VP6 BIOS does not have the
option to turn off ACPI, perhaps I should try one of the hacked bioses at
abitvp6.com to turn off ACPI (maybe it is the culprit..) This is my
current situation (right after a USB lock):
           CPU0       CPU1
  0:     260203     267484    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:      10471      10704    IO-APIC-edge  keyboard
  2:          0          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  5:      29249      29198   IO-APIC-level  usb-uhci, usb-uhci
  9:          0          0    IO-APIC-edge  acpi
 10:      13715      13332   IO-APIC-level  eth0
 14:       6255       5839    IO-APIC-edge  ide0
 15:         10          3    IO-APIC-edge  ide1
NMI:          0          0
LOC:     527647     527647

The acpi device appears whether or not I have ACPI support in the kernel.

2.5 exhibits similar behavior.
