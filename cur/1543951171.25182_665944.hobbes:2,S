Here is v2 with the suggested improvement
-Greg
------------------------
keep rd->online and cpu_online_map in sync
It is possible to allow the root-domain cache of online cpus to
become out of sync with the global cpu_online_map.  This is because we
currently trigger removal of cpus too early in the notifier chain.
Other DOWN_PREPARE handlers may in fact run and reconfigure the
root-domain topology, thereby stomping on our own offline handling.
The end result is that rd->online may become out of sync with
cpu_online_map, which results in potential task misrouting.
So change the offline handling to be more tightly coupled with the
global offline process by triggering on CPU_DYING intead of
CPU_DOWN_PREPARE.
