Also note that we have Open Sound System call redirector in our alsa-oss 
package (see 
http://www.alsa-project.org
 for download). It's small library 
which can redirects OSS calls to any dynamic library.
It would be nice to convert existing OSS apps to use this library. It 
should be quite fast and easy. The only thing is to persuade sound
developers to use this library instead the direct open/close/ioctl 
OSS syscalls.
