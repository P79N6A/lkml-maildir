I tried this, but it seems that neither of these settings will take any value 
over 128 (which is what they both started at before I tried to change them). 
It seems that I can set values _lower_ than 128, but nothing higher (stock 
Slackware 10.2 2.6.13 kernel).

Sure. Here's the results:

----------------------------------------
I don't think anyone is implying this, but for the record, this problem is not 
peculiar to this particular hard disk drive. I seem to see the problem on any 
2.6.x kernel with a ReiserFS filesystem that has _not_ enabled the 
(undocumented, as near as I can see) 'nolargeio=1' option on the mount.
Also, I haven't heard anything more after Hans Reiser queried Ulrich Drepper 
about the 'glibc' angle on this problem, so I'm wondering if there's been any 
progress on that front. Oh, I just noticed that Hans has re-pinged Ulrich on 
this issue -- thanks, Hans!
Anway, as always, thanks to all who've contributed to this thread.
