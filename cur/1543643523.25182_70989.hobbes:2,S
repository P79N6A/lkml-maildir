It is clear that different hardware and hardware settings will show up different
areas of weakness. Furthermore, different file systems will affect the load very
differently. This test is just in it's infancy and has already undergone five
revisions in the two days it has existed. It will be interesting to see these
hardware effects, and how the different subsystems affect different areas.
My test machine is also a laptop, 256Mb Ram PIII@1133 and it runs reiserFS
The test is now at version 0.23 with a different mem_load so may show up more
mem differences. V 0.30 will be a code cleanup mainly by Rik.
It now has a homepage:
