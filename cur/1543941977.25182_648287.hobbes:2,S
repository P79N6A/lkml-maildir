AoE is truly a thing of beauty.  It has a two/three page RFC (say no more!).
But quite so...  AoE is limited to MTU size, which really hurts.  Can't 
really do tagged queueing, etc.
iSCSI is way, way too complicated.  It's an Internet protocol designed 
by storage designers, what do you expect?
For years I have been hoping that someone will invent a simple protocol 
(w/ strong auth) that can transit ATA and SCSI commands and responses. 
Heck, it would be almost trivial if the kernel had a TLS/SSL implementation.
