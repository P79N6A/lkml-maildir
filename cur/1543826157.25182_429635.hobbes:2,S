Well, you can only miss a message *you would not see anyway*. I guess
the main concern is that it tends to look ugly on the screen (and it
will not be quite easy code).
Anyway, no, I do not think it is needed. framebuffers are fast enough
these days. When I used to have 300MHz toshiba laptop with UHCI
bogging down the system, something like that would be handy... (2sec
to do screen update in loaded-with-usb cases).
