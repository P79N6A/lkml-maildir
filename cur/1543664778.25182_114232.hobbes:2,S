Version 2.5.0-pre2 of perfctr, the Linux/x86 performance
monitoring counters driver, is now available at the usual
place: 
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/perfctr/
This is hopefully the last major update before 2.5.0 final.
The ABI version query should help avoid some common user
mistakes. In an ideal world it shouldn't be needed, but
a driver maintained outside of the standard kernel, with
an API still under development, needs these safety checks.
Version 2.5.0-pre2, 2003-03-03
- Added a way for user-space to query the driver's ABI version,
  and updated the library to check it.
- Fixed <linux/perfctr.h> to not include <asm/perfctr.h> when
  perfctr hasn't been configured. This allows the patched kernel
  source to compile cleanly also in archs not supported by perfctr.
- Major patch kit overhaul. Updated configuration help texts.
  Removed unnecessary features and patches. Some cleanups. Added
  aliasing support to the 'update-kernel' script, which allows a
  patch to serve several kernels (when applicable).
- The perfctr configuration option was poorly placed. It is now
  at the end of the "Processor type and features" menu.
- Removed "notsc" kernel option support from the 2.2 kernel patches.
  To use the driver with an IDT WinChip (Centaur C6/2/3) CPU now
  requires a newer kernel with native "notsc" support.
- Driver fixes for changes in the 2.4.21-pre5 and 2.5.63 kernels.
