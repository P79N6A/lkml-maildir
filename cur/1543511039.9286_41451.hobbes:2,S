But, Ingo, are we going to add udelay(5000) into slow path to make
sure some abstract guy has motivation? Should we add udelay(5000) into
select() in order to make people use poll()?
Certainly not.
I think that our slow path should be optimized, too. No need to talk
about abstract bugs. No matter how finegrained our locks are, under
some workload they still will content, and that's why it is good to
optimize it, too.
