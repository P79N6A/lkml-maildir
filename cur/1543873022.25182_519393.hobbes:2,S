According to the report I have.  Perhaps a bogus section qualifier does 
more damage than an omitted one.  I'll get gcc  / linker version, but 
this could be a combination of user error, a strange toolchain, and 
perhaps a real bug somewhere.

Yes, I was surprised by this as well, and I'm still skeptical about this 
being the real cause.  Still, this reportedly fixed the problem, and is 
certainly not a bad thing.
