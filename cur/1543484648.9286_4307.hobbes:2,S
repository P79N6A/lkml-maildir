Hello,
The DOS-NCSA FTP-Client can't do downloads from a 2.2.0-Linux-Box anymore.
They start slowly and then stop suddenly. 
2.0.x worked fine. (Path MTU discovery is not the problem, I tried this
already ;-) 
The problem is reproducible on two different Linux boxes and clients. 
What should I do? 
Thanks in advance!
Greetings,
Peter
