Let me guess: xine opens the raw device, and does all the DVD parsing
from there. 
Furthermore, maybe it closes and re-opens the device for each VOB file. 
Which in turn will invalidate the buffer and page cache, and force a
re-read of all the metadata..  Oh, and wait for all the prefetching to
have finished.
If this is it, it should be "fixed" by doing a
	sleep 100000 < /dev/dvd-device &
in the background before starting xine?
Does that make any difference?
If it does, then I suspect we should really look into making the raw
device close just leave the device descriptor around at least for a
while. Al?
