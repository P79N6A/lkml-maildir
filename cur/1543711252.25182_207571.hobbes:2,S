yes, lots of clean buffers.

I have a scheduling point in journal_end() in 2.4.  But I added bugs to
reiserfs a couple of times doing this - it's pretty delicate.  Beat up on

networking in general can cause problems, as can the random driver, which I
hacked rather flakily in 2.4.
davem fixed the tcp_minisock reaping in 2.6, which helps.
