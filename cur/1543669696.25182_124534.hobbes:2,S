That's only a keyboard, but interestingly it shows up as a keyboard AND mouse.
(This kernel is 2.4.21-pre5-ac3)
Anyway: In 2.5 bitkeeper (4/11/03), my keyboard is completely dead - even 
sysrq doesn't work. I've had similar problems with recent 2.4 bitkeeper 
kernels (but I can't be very specific - I can re-test if you'd like me to)
The keyboard works on 2.4.21-pre5-ac3.
Relevant Config: 
INPUT, SERIO, USB_UHCI_HCD, USB_HID, USB_HIDINPUT = Y
Enabling standard AT keyboard (which shouldn't be necessary) doesn't help.
