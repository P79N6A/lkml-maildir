Other contributors objected at the time. Furthermore there is merging of
third party GPL code from bodies like the FSF who also object and didnt
submit their code themselves.

No. Sorry its neccessary to keep correcting people here but I have no
intention of allowing anyone creating a derivative work to claim
estoppel when they get their arses kicked some years on. Their sole
defence is that the work is not derivative. In some cases I can believe
that could be a valid claim.
As to _GPL. Its primarily a way of ensuring people who mix binary code
in with their kernel in unsupportable ways are made aware of it, and so
we can all use filter rules to discard their bugs.
Some vendors do support certain third party binary modules in some
specific enterprise configurations, others don't. In the community case
the general rule is we don't.
