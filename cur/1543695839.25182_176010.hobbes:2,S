Hi,
Use 2.6.0-test9-mm1 play xmms use OSS emulation sound sometimes distorted (did renice xmms to -10)
but apart from the time it got distorted, soudn quality is really good. If use
through esd the distorted is gone, but sound quality a bit worse.
The question is? How can I make xmms not distorted? SHould I specify the
option non_block mode to snd-pcm-oss? If yes how to do that as I compile alsa built
into the kernel (not a modules) so which kernel parameters do the job?
Plese CC me to haiquy@yahoo.com
Thanks
