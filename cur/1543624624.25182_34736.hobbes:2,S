OK. I did but no luck.  The results are quite the same.
I think the hugest problem is:

 So then file is memory mapped and is read from some pages are coming
 out from swap instead of being read from file....

Well. This was not really needed as I repeated the test several times
in a loop without clearing the cache after initial cleaning to see how
stable are results.
