Hi,
I got some problems with compiling in test7-pre5 in the network section and
found, that the tcp_ecn.h was not found. This is located at the moment in the
directory net. After I created a link in include/net everything worked fine.
Is the net directory the correct place for this file?
Cheers
Hartmut
