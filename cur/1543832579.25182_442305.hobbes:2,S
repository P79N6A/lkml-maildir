Subject: [patch 2.6.18-rc1] genirq: {en,dis}able_irq_wake() need refcounting too
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

It's not just "normal" mode operation that needs refcounting for the
{en,dis}able_irq() calls ... "wakeup" mode calls need it too, for the
very same reasons.
This patch adds that refcounting.  I expect that some ARM drivers will
be triggering the new warning, but this call isn't yet widely used.
(Which is probably why the bug has lingered this long...)
- Dave
IRQs need refcounting and a state flag to track whether the the IRQ should
be enabled or disabled as a "normal IRQ" source after a series of calls to
disable_irq() and enable_irq().  For shared IRQs, the IRQ must be enabled
so long as at least one driver needs it active.
Likewise, IRQs need the same support to track whether the IRQ should be
enabled or disabled as a "wakeup event" source after a series of calls to
enable_irq_wake() and disable_irq_wake().  For shared IRQs, the IRQ must
be wakeup-enabled so long as at least one driver needs it.
But right now they don't have that refcounting ... which means sharing
wakeup-capable IRQs can't work correctly in some configurations.  This
patch adds the refcount and flag mechanisms to set_irq_wake(), and a
minimal description of what an irq wake mechanism is.
Drivers relying on the older (broken) "toggle" semantics will trigger a
warning; that'll be a handful of drivers on ARM systems.
