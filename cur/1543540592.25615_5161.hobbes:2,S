I've got a similar machine (a ka7 board), which has:
00:07.1 IDE interface: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82C586 IDE [Apollo] (rev
10) (prog-if 8a [Master SecP PriP])
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 32
        I/O ports at a000 [size=16]
        Capabilities: [c0] Power Management version 2

This seems to suggest that DMA is indeed working (though not necesarily
optimally).

I don't have CONFIG_VIA82CXXX_TUNING set.

I don't have CONFIG_IDEDMA_IVB set either.  Maybe your box isn't detecting
cables properly, or your cables just suck?

This looks like a hardware problem, but I'm no expert on this.
