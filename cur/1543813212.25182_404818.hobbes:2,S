Is is an GFS-crash and just for the record the GFS guys have made a fix 
in the CVS Stable branch:
CVSROOT:    /cvs/cluster
Module name:    cluster
Branch:     STABLE
Changes by:    bmarzins@sourceware.org    2006-03-08 20:47:09
Modified files:
     gfs-kernel/src/gfs: ops_inode.c
Log message:
  Really gross hack!!!
  This is a workaround for one of the bugs the got lumped into 166701. It
  breaks POSIX behavior in a corner case to avoid crashing... It's icky.
  when NFS opens a file with O_CREAT, the kernel nfs daemon checks to see
  if the file exists. If it does, nfsd does the *right thing* (either
  opens the file, or if the file was opened with O_EXCL, returns an
  error).  If the file doesn't exist, it passes the request down to the
  underlying file system. Unfortunately, since nfs *knows* that the file
  doesn't exist, it doesn't  bother to pass a nameidata structure, which
  would include the intent information. However since gfs is a cluster
  file system, the file could have been created on another node after nfs
  checks for it. If this is the case, gfs needs the intent information to
  do the *right thing*.  It panics when it finds a NULL pointer, instead
  of the nameidata. Now, instead of panicing, if gfs finds a NULL
  nameidata pointer. It assumes that the file was not created with _EXCL.
  This assumption could be wrong, with the result that an application
  could thing that it has created a new file, when in fact, it has opened
  an existing one.
