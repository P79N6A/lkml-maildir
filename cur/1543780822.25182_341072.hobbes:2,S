Well thanks everyone for the discussion and input. If I have missed
answering a question, please just mail me privately to let me know.
I guess that despite some architecture implementation differences,
everyone will be happy to see PageReserved go from core code. So
I will send Andrew the patches.
After that, we have a few options to move forward with completely
getting rid of the flag from the other funny places it has cropped
up. A portable page_is_ram() sounds like the best way to go, as it
would not use up a page flag.
As far as ioremap goes - I would rather completely disallow it from
remapping physical pages and enforce that where possible (eg. with
page_is_ram()).
However, these issues (page_is_ram, swsusp, ioremap) need not be
tackled right now. I will bring them up on the lists some time after
the core mm/ is working nicely without PageReserved.
Thanks,
Nick
