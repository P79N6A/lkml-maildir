I do recomend Promise's SATA controller cards.  The kernel drivers are excellent
imho.  As well as my onboard Promise TX2, I'm using a thei S150 SX4 RAID5
capable controller in my file server.  A controlle ard should be easy enough to
finnd online.  I shop at NewEgg.com.  Good prices, highly rcommended.
I'm gonna take a look at your .config as soon as I get back to my own computer.
Cheers.
