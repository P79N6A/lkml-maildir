Here's a wild guess. Is the 'sg' driver loaded. This sounds similar to
my complaint with trying to rmmod 'st'. When I load my SCSI HBA driver,
it automagically pulls in st for my tape drive *and* sg. Now, if you try
to remove it, it "hangs". It's because sg also got a reference. If you
rmmod 'sg' then the rmmod of st frees up too.
The problem above is that st has module use count of 0, but that's a
lie. sg has glommed on that device, and the true reference count is
actually one (if you consider that st owns the tape device). It seems to
me that what should happen is for the SCSI layer/drivers to handle
kicking sg out when they want to unload. If the consensus is that this
is desirable, I'm happy to go off and see what needs to be done.
Otherwise, I'll crawl back into my hole :-)
