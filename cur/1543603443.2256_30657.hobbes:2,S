Not only stat64, also plain stat.

The fields are meant for nanoseconds.  The y2038 will definitely be
solved by time-shifting or making time_t unsigned.  In any way nothing
of importance here and now.  Especially since there won't be many
systems which are running today and which have a 32-bit time_t be used
then.  For the rest I'm sure that in 37 years there will be the one or
the other ABI change.
