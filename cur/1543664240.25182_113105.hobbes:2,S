It is mostly the device field I had in mind.

Unfortunately it is the best solution I can come up with.

Would you fsck /var while it is mounted?
I think part of the problem is that /var is used for both files
we want to keep across reboot, and files we do not want to keep
across reboot.
There are cases where it is undesirable to have mtab in /var,
but if mount expect to find mtab somewhere under /var, we can't
even use a symlink to get it out of there, because /var needs
to be mounted before the symlink can be followed.
