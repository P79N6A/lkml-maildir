'Touching' is not interesting since it will pump data
into cache, no matter how you 'touch' it.
Running benchmarks against 1K static buffer makes cache red hot
and causes _all writes_ to hit it. It may lead to wrong conclusions. 
Is _dst_ buffer of csum_copy going to be used by processor soon?
If yes, we shouldn't use movntq, we want to cache dst.
If no, we should by all means use movntq.
If sometimes, then optimal strategy does not exist. :(
