Thanks for testing the code :)

Can you test it with a bit depth not a multiple of 32/64?  Or just force
the code to always call slow_imageblit?  I'm concerned about
slow_imageblit not correct with big endian machines.

It looks like a fillrect problem.

I'm also attaching cfbfillrect.c which hopefully addresses some of the
problems which Geert mentioned before (access/pitch alignment, support
for all bit depths, etc).

PS. Sorry about the attachment, my mailer mangles inline text.
