Hi all,
attached is a patch adding support for Adaptec's USBXchange and USB2Xchange 
USB to SCSI converter dongles.
In 2004 Beier & Dauskardt IT <sda@bdit.de> already posted a patch, that was 
not accepted because it was for 2.4 and included the firmware.
This patch is based on that work, but ported to 2.6 as well as to the new 
firmware loader. Support for the USBXchange was added as well as cleanups 
done.
Compatible firmware dumps, obtained by USB I/O logging, are available here:
  
http://dl.exactcode.de/adaptec-usbxchange/
Alternatively people can dump it out from the windows driver looking for the 
offset.
After the firmware upload the devices behave as normal usb-storage devices.
This version was only tested with the USB 1.x version - but I get a 
USB2Xchange, hopefully tomorrow.
