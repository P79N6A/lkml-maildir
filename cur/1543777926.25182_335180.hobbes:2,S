I don't want to tell where these are in general, I need an easy way to 
seek to the m'th directory + offset position without reading every 
single dirent. With i_sizes != 0 it is straight forward to use "the sum 
of the m directory's i_sizes + offset" as the f_pos to seek to. For this 
purpose it is not necessary to have a "honest" i_size as long as the 
i_size is bigger than the offset of the last dirent in the directory.

E.g.: ext2_validate_entry() is called if filp->f_version != 
inode->i_version.

Which is a user problem again. Might be that you are opening a different 
directory with the same name ... or even a regular file!
