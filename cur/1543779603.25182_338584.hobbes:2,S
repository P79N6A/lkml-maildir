Your workload is going to be almost entirely IO bound, with
the only CPU intensive parts being 99% in userspace. So any
performance gains by tuning the kernel for a specific CPU are
likely to be unnoticable.  I'd go with a single image supporting
the lowest hardware you intend to support.
CPU tuned variants of gzip/bzip may be more noticable however.
