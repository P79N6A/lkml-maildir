When asked at the linux Bof at usenix about devfs Linus responded that 
he likes the idea of dynamic names
has some issues about the specific nameing scheme
thinks it will be pretty much a requirement with hot-pluggable busses
will "probably" be included soon in 2.3
is very concerned about the extreme resistance that some have against the
idea

"If users are made to understand that the system administrator's job is to
make computers run, and not to make them happy, they can, in fact, be made
happy most of the time. If users are allowed to believe that the system
administrator's job is to make them happy, they can, in fact, never be made
happy."
