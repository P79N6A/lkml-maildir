An oops in cascade() is tricky.  Normally it means that some piece of code
has done something bad with a kernel timer.  Later, a clock tick happens
and the kernel falls over.  We're left with no hints as to which part of
the kernel misbehaved.
Please try enabling CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB and CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC and see if
that reveals any additional info.
Apart from that, you have a lot of modules configured there.  Please try
disabling them all, see if the oops goes away.  If it does then try
re-enabling them, see if you can narrow it down to the one which is causing
the timer list corruption.
Thanks.
