Well parts of it appear to be uncredited Don Becker work, and the rest of
it is just ugly. Don's natsemi.c may well be a better choice ? - see
his driver archives.

So its a non candidate.

This is suicidal. Several identical boxes powering on together will pick
the same address. If the address isnt set fail it

Uninlined i/o operations ??
Can you also bang it into the shape the CodingStyle document asks - indent
to tab etc.
