Well, let me clarify:
I'm sure the original code has a bug.
I do think that it is related to your report 
(but I don't have time to confirm it.)
s6_addr[3] should be s6_addr32[3] because the code is intended to extract 
IPv4 address from the IPv4-mapped address (::ffff:0.0.0.0/96)
to convert sockaddr_in6{} to sockaddr_in{}.
My analysis against the report is as follows:
Because the address is IPv4-mapped address (::ffff:0.0.0.0/96) at the point,
s6_addr[3] is always 0. The socket will be always connected to 0.0.0.0,
which means 127.0.0.1.
The patch is definitely logically correct.
Please apply this.  Thanks.
