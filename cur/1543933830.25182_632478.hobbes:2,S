yep.  and /var is nosuid,nodev as well.

this system is write intensive and writes go to all spindles, so you're
assertion is wrong.  a quick look at iostat shows the system has averaged
50/50 reads/writes over 34 days.  that means 50% of the IO is going to
both spindles.

not sure why you think i want different restrictions... i'm running fine
with nosuid,nodev for /var.
the main worry i have is some user maliciously hardlinks everything
under /var/log somewhere else and slowly fills up the file system with
old rotated logs.  the users otherwise have quotas so they can't fill
things up on their own.  i could probably set up XFS quota trees (aka
"projects") but haven't gone to this effort yet.

i disagree.  but this is getting into personal taste -- i find volume
managers to be an unnecessary layer of complexity.  given i need quotas for
the users anyhow i don't see why i should both manage my disk space via
quotas and via an extra block layer.

you probably missed the point where i said that i was surprised i couldn't
hardlink across the bind mount and actually wanted it to work.
