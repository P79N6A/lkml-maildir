This reminds me that drm tree in linux-next still results in BSOD (Black
Screen Of Death) on starting X for me (as reported on Saturday [1]).
Actually there is more to it as I discovered that my custom X radeon driver
(which is xorg-x11-drv-ati-6.9.0-61.fc10.i386 with "radeon: no need for this
anymore" from radeon-gem-cs change reverted, please see [2] for my previous
monologue) works fine while following stock driver versions:
	xorg-x11-drv-ati-6.8.0-19.fc9.i386
	xorg-x11-drv-ati-6.9.0-61.fc10.i386
	xorg-x11-drv-ati-6.9.0-62.fc10.i386
result in BSOD.  OTOH they all work with next-20081128 (modulo hangs with
fc10 ones when "radeon: no need for this anymore" change is not reverted).
[ BTW xorg-x11-drv-ati-6.9.0-62.fc10.i386 still causes hangs when used with
  non-Fedora kernels and Fedora/kms kernel still has performance problems ]
IOW there are a lot of compatibility issues in recent drm/radeon changes.
Dave, could you please start looking into these problems?  I'm sure that we
all want recent drm changes + kms in 2.6.29 but given tight schedule and the
way things are looking right now I'm quite sceptical...
