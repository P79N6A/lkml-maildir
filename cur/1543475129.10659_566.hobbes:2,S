Hi,
I got my zip drive to work under 2.2.0-pre4 but I have noticed that
every once and a while it clicks.  I don't recall this happening in
any of the 2.1.x or 2.0.35/36 kernels.  Is the drive going to sleep?
Also I can't seem to compile NTFS support into the kernel either.
I removed it from the config and it seems to compile fine.  I see that the
NTFS had major updates in this release.  Probably has something to do with
that though.  If someone could confirm/dispute this, I would like to hear
from you.
Thanks,
Tuan
