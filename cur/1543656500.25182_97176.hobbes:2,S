The promise chips often respond to starnge situations by locking up the 
PCI bus.  In particular they assert the wait signal and do not release 
it.  This locks the system up had the next time the CPU tries to access 
the PCI bus.  The machine is dead in your case and needs to be reset.
I've sent a PCI bus trace of this happening to Promise and have not yet 
heard anything back yet.
