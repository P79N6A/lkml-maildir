Instead of using "evms_vgscan", you should probably run "evms_rediscover". 
But you really only need that if you've compiled EVMS as modules in your 
kernel.
For volume admin tasks, I would recommend using "evmsgui" if you have X 
available, or "evmsn" if you need text-mode.
The LVM-style commands (like evms_vgscan) were originally written as testing 
tools before we had the fully-functional UIs. They were left around as kind 
of a proof-of-concept that the EVMS engine library API can be used to emulate 
existing volume management tools.
