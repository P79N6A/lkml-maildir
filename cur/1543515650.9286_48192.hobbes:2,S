Jakub, this is your contribution, can you comment on this?

If you have two threads sharing timers the current->posix_timers is
already initialized in fork.c when the clone_flags has the CLONE_ITIMERS
bit set.
So either the current->posix_timers is initialized in the clone or it is
initialized by the first timer_create (in which case there was only one
thread).

The timers are not inherited/copied across a fork, so do pending
signals.
I don't see the problem. Am I missing something?
Of course when you do a clone() with CLONE_ITIMERS you share the itimers
of the parent process/thread.
Signal queues cannot be shared between threads. I recall that this is one
of the remaining incompatibilities of LinuxThreads with POSIX threads.
