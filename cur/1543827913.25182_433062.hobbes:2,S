I think that's obsolete since you can do it from initrd/initramfs for a 
looong time.
BTW, if so, why has not this been removed yet?

It is only a very simple dhcp client that only requests the lease 
once in a boot lifetime, even if the server will drop the lease when 
it expired.

looking into any further.
