ok, i've looked through most of 2.5.4 now.
results look like this:
			pci_alloc_consistent()	pci_free_consistent()
i386:
		[1]	ok			ok
ppc:
		[1]	ok			ok
mips:
		[1]	ok			ok
sh:
		[1]	ok			ok
  stm:		[1]	ok			ok
  dc:		[3]	ok			ok
mips64:
  ip32:		[1]	ok			ok
  ip27:		[1]	ok			ok
sparc:
		[1]	GFP_KERNEL		ok
sparc64:
		[2]	ok			ok
arm:		[4]	BUG()/GFP_KERNEL	BUG()
alpha:
		[2]	ok			ok
ia64:		[5]	ok?			ok?
[1]
gfp() + __pa() (or similar)
[2]
gfp() + IOMMU
[3]
dummy, offsets only
[4]     
ARM does GFP_KERNEL, and then __ioremaps the underlying pages.
ugh. is that the only way to get the area coherent?
furthermore i don't see why this could not be interrupt safe.
[5]
i don't understand ia64. but it looks somewhat atomic :)
well, assuming i didn't oversee anything, there are indeed few reasons
left why the whole _consistent() machinery shouldn't be callable from
interrupts. 
back to my original question: what were the last trees with shrinking
pools? would the original version still work or any redesigns needed?
