Its a shame to have it default off, seeing as it fixes a real starvation
/ unfairness problem, and nobody is going to turn it on. It would be
nice to turn it on by default and see how many people shout about the

I guess it will be useful to be able to ask people to try it if they are
reporting bad behaviour.
