This has been beaten to death enough times already, but solely because
of the ego complex of one rather powerful person (hint: nothing to do
with IBM) it isn't as dead as deserved and GNU software keeps renaming
every "linux" getting under its hands to "linux-gnu" or "gnu-linux" as
it just sees fit and the mess it thus creates on every other user's
filesystem gets worse with each release of the otherwise fine autoconf
utilities.
I have resorted to always call the following instead of "configure":
#!/bin/sh
for i in config.sub config.guess ltconfig; do
    if [ -f $i -a ! -f $i.gnu ]; then
	perl -i.gnu -pe 's:linux-gnu:linux:g' $i
    fi
done
exec ./configure "$@"
It's ironic that it was the FSF who started this bulls___, not IBM who 
everyone likes to bash.
