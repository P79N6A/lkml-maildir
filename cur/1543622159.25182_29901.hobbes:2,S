The main thing is that you need to watch out for renames in patches.
bk import -tpatch handles that, straight patch does not.  If you don't
catch the renames life will suck because one file will be deleted in
your tree but may not be deleted yet in another tree.  If someone else 
is working on the old tree and you pull from them, their updates will
go to the deleted file.  They are there, but pretty useless if you 
wanted them in the file with the new name.
We need to tweak stuff so that you can use bk import -temail or something
like that and it's a combination of Linus' scripts and the current code.
Linus?  Scripts?
