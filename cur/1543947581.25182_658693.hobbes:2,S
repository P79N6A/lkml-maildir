Obviously I hold no sway here, so there's little point in my continuing
to try and fight this madness, but I have to say my piece. Don't worry,
I'll leave it after this - I know Ingo always gets his way.

Now work out whether this is a result of the kernel code or not. Whilst
there's probably no point me stating this: I object most strenuously to
the idea of merging duplicate code that does part of what oprofile does.
Soren wrote sysprof when he tried an earlier version of oprofile and
found it slightly non-obvious. Instead of doing any of these things:
- complaining to the oprofile list
- checking a version of oprofile written in the last two years
- fixing oprofile user space to be more obvious
he just went on right ahead and re-implemented it so he could write a
GUI on top of it. That *exact same GUI*  could have been on top of
oprofile. Usability problems with opcontrol or opreport could have been
reported (or even - gosh - fixed). Soren was too lazy.
It seems the same applies to you and Arjan, at least.

I honestly can't believe that you're telling me you'd rather have more
kernel code than make some tweaks (which, by the way, you have NEVER
complained about to me or to the oprofile mailing list until now)
to a shell script. Specifically:

Wrong. It's shipped with a (rather poor) GUI pretty much since
inception. More recently, there's been at least two GUIs. For example:

Firstly, the distributions should have set this up automatically. That
they don't is a distributor bug. The sheer madness of Linux not leaving
a vmlinux file in a stable known location is hardly something oprofile
can be blamed for.
Secondly, not ONE PERSON INCLUDING YOU has EVER suggested to us that we
default to no vmlinux.

It's astonishing that you would know about this, complaining about this,
but not file a bug report. Same goes for the rest.
And once again, please explain how the buggy shell script has anything
to do with kernel code.
What, exactly, happened to scratching an itch? If everyone should be
hanging his head in shame, Ingo, why haven't you used your considerable
influence to find a maintainer for OProfile to fix the (until now,
private to you) issues you have with it? Shameful? Indeed.
