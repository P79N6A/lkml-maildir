This wasn't ment as a slight against Quadrics, only to point out that
the specific wire protcols used by IB and iwarp are what cause this
limitation, it would be easy to imagine that Quadrics has some
additional twist that can make this easier..

I ment that HPC users are unlikely to want to swap active RDMA pages
if this causes a performance cost on normal operations. None of my
comments are ment to imply that lazy de-registration or page migration
are not good things.
