Subject: CFQ will be the new default IO scheduler - why?

The default IO scheduler in 2.6.18 will be CFQ (Complete Fair Queuing) 
instead of AS (Anticipatory Scheduler) as described here: 
http://wiki.kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_18.
 I tried to find (here, at lkml) 
the discussion about this change with no luck.
What is the reason CFQ will be the new default? What advantages it has over 
AS performance and feature wise? Any links to relevant and recent 
benchmarks?
And if there is a recent discussion about this online, a link would be 
greatly appreciated.
Best regards,
Paapaa
