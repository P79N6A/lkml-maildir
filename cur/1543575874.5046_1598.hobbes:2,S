It returns a cookie for use with ioremap. Who says that a given device has
a constant bus or physical mapping that is unique ?

No. Ioremap takes a cookie and returns a different cookie suitable for using
with readb/writeb/memcpy_fromio and friends.
Eg on Sparc64 its a physical address and readb uses TLB bypass
