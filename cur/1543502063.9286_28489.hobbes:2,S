I wrote many drivers for windows and I know how ugly are their kernels.
Windows extensibility is low too.
But they learn on their mistakes.
NT 4.x has almost acceptable filter-driver system.
Although it is unusable in some situations due to M$ favorite opacity,
it allows to write a lot of interesting tools.
Even silly '9x has 'hooks'.
Let us learn on their mistakes too ;-)

Hooks and filters are innocent.
M$ problem is opacity and ugly initial design.

%-(. Forget these poor windows!
Pushing an idea +
fixing the whole kernel +
fixing interfaces +
distributing new feature
     = some months per feature.
New driver system = some months *once*!

And companies almost ready to sell these features to users don't want to
distribute patches.
And users stick to windows... :-(
Do we want to rule the world? ;-)
               Best regards
                         Alexander.
