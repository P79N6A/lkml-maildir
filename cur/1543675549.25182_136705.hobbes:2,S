I have a raid0 patch from Neil, but no raid1 patch.  I saw one drift past,
from Zwane (I think), but wasn't sure that it worked.  If someone has a
raid1 fix, please send it.

Welll ext3 has been a bit bumpy of course.  It's getting better, but I
haven't yet been able to give it a 12-hour bash on the 4-way.  Last time I
tried a circuit breaker conked; it lasted three hours but even ext3 needs
electricity.  But three hours is very positive - it was hard testing.
I'm not testing RAID at present, partly because I'm too stoopid to
understand mdadm and partly because the box-with-18-disks heats the room up
too much.  This needs to change, because of possible interaction between
the IO scheduler work and software RAID.
