I turned on taskfile io on my last kernel, and had some stability
problems.  This is ia32, all ide but with ide-scsi.
I experienced severe performance disruptions followed by what appeared to
be a system hang twice.  Before that, I was recieving an "hdd: lost
interrupt"  message every few hours, and the system felt sluggish.  (The
ide-scsi device is hdc, not hdd.)  I have not had these problems with a
kernel compiled without taskfile io.
Is this a known problem?  I can provide more information if it would be
helpful.
I also got the following, which looks like what Nick Evgeniev reported May
24 (2.4.19-pre8 ide bugs).  Andre said to him

As I had enabled taskfile IO, I figured I'd mention this:
11:42:29 bug: kernel timer added twice at c01b0107.
c01b00b8 T ide_set_handler
c01b0110 t atapi_reset_pollfunc
11:45:35 scsi0 channel 0 : resetting for second half of retries.
11:45:35 SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0.
11:45:35 hdd: ide_set_handler: handler not null; old=c01b0110, new=c01b1474
c01b0110 t atapi_reset_pollfunc
c01b1474 T task_in_intr
11:45:35 bug: kernel timer added twice at c01b0107.
