Sure we need that.  Not only for distro's "value add", but basically for
everything which depends on utilities not shipped with the kernel
(rootfs-on-lvm for example, udev & /dev setup, ...).  It's probably also
very handy for users and hackers to have a standard way to add stuff to
the initramfs during normal kernel build, without having to build their own.
cheers,
