The nightly LTP test against the 2.5 kernel bk tree last night turned up
some test failures we don't normally see.  These failures did not show
up in the run from the previous night.
execve06    0  INFO  :  Test FAILED
getpgid01    0  INFO  :  getpgid01 FAILED
mprotect03    1  FAIL  :  child returned unexpected status
All three are showing warnings that look like this before the failure:
mprotect03    0  WARN  :  signal() failed for signal 41. error:22
Invalid argument.
mprotect03    0  WARN  :  signal() failed for signal 51. error:22
Invalid argument.
