Put another way: if we had introduced the BKL-as-semaphore with a known 
40% performance drop in AIM7, I would simply never ever have accepted the 
patch in the first place, regardless of _any_ excuses. 
Performance is a feature too.
Now, just because the code is already merged should not be an excuse for 
it then being shown to be bad. It's not a valid excuse to say "but we 
already merged it, so we can't unmerge it". We sure as hell _can_ unmerge 
it.
