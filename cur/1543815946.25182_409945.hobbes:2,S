well, the reason i use it is my computer is much more reactive in the morning. 
linux uses to get very slow after a night of not-doing-much except some 
'sleep 5h && blabla' and cron stuff. in the morning it takes a few HOURS to 
get up and running smoothly. with swap prefetch, it actually feels faster 
compared to a fresh boot. now you can force swap prefetch to start working, i 
use it now and then after some heavy taskts which pulled everything to swap.
