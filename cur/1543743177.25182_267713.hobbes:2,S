 Only the BSP gets them (not APs) and it's we who arrange for that. ;-)  
We only enable LVT1 on the BSP -- APs have this input masked.  See 
setup_local_APIC().

 It's specific to system software run.  You'd have to have a look at some
Linux documentation covering the area -- your best bet is the code itself.
