i think it could be structured in a way so that every step is either 
small, or yields no change in the vmlinux binary. The former is 
reviewable, the latter is machine-checkable.
At least that's how i do such changes and i have yet to find a code 
transformation where such techniques cannot be used to minimize regression 
risks.

applied, thanks Nick.
Lets try it with the current large patch once more ... but if there's one 
more regression then i guess we need to do the splitup, to be on the safe 
side.
