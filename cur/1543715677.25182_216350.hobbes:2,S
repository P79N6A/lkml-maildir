Hi,
     I'm upgrading my workstation from 2.4.22 to 2.6.5 and everything is 
working great except for /dev/input/mice: it doesn't appear to be 
producing anything, even if I cat it. I've checked and both dmesg and 
/proc/bus/input/devices show the mouse handler loaded and show the mouse 
as recognized. I've tried disabling ACPI because I saw it mentioned when 
I googled, but that didn't help. I've also tried loading the event 
handler module and I get nothing there either. I have another PC with 
2.6.5 working fine with the same mouse. Both are hooked up to the same 
KVM, would that have anything to do with it? Does anyone know where I 
could look to get more detail on what's happening?
Thanks,
Derek
