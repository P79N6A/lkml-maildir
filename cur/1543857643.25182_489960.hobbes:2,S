Why? The s390 vmem_map implementation which I sent last week to linux-mm
is merged in the meantime. It supports both 32 and 64 bit.
The main reason is to keep things simple and avoid #ifdef hell.
Since the maximum size of the virtual array is  about 16MB it's not much
waste of address space. Actually I just changed the size of the vmalloc
area, so that the maximum supported physical amount of memory is still 1920MB.
