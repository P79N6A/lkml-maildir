Mika is correct that the exit_mmap(old_mm) still needs to happen on the
last use of the "mm_struct".  But whether it's called directly from
exec_mmap() or indirectly from mmput() still needs to depend on the
value of "mm_users".
The original logic avoided the mmdrop(active_mm) call if there was an
old_mm, so I'd infer that the mm_struct reference count is not bumped
twice for both references from the task_struct (mm and active_mm).  So
the patch would need to be reworked to avoid the double decrement, too.
Sorry I missed the discussion on the original changes.  Was there a
race condition with another cpu gaining a reference in proc_pid_status()
or access_process_vm() or something like that?  Is it possible to just
use down_read(&old_mm->mmap_sem) and up_read(&old_mm->mmap_sem) inside
exec_mmap() around the optimized call to exit_mmap() instead?
Cheers.  -ernie
