I am not sure what you are asking for... but I will give it a shot. ;)
One of the tools that comes with the package binutils is called objdump.
If you compile your source with -g flag then you can use objdump to
display mixed assembly and C source code.
	gcc -g foo.c -o foo.o
	objdumpt -S foo.o
I hope this helps.
