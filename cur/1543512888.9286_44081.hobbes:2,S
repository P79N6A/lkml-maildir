I am currently using an overclocked Celeron 300 (now 450). The only real
interest I have in the PIII and above is the hardware random number
generator (using thermal noise). I have seen discussion of PIII kernel
patches, but not about the random number generator. Does support for
this exist or is it planned, and is there a repository for PIII patches?
IMHO, the hardware random generator might improve cryptography somewhat,
and is the only feature desirable to me that the Althon lacks (AFAIK,
anyway).
