I jumped directly from 2.4.18pre1 to 2.5.3, and I didn't see any issues
with the 2.4 kernel in the time I ran it.
This doesn't rule out a pre-existing corruption, of course, but it seems
to me unlikely in the extreme. Er, in my case, of course. I can't speak
for others.

Yes, I hate that. You spend all this time trying to explain to people that
they don't *have* to hammer nails into their own heads all the time, only to
discover that they *like* it because it's all they've ever known.
