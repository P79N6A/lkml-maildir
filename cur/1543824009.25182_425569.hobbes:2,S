Subject: [PATCH] Page writeback broken after resume: wb_timer lost

Hi,
I have noticed for some time that nr_dirty never drops but
increases except when VM pressure forces it down. This only
occurs after a resume, never on a freshly booted system.
It seems the wb_timer is lost when the timer function is
trying to start a frozen pdflush thread, and this occurs
during suspend or resume.
I have included a patch which work for me. Don't know if the
test also should include a check for freezing to be safe, ie
  if ( !frozen(..) && !freezing(..) )
