It does. Fixed the caller:
        @@query_page_cache_segment()
        index = radix_tree_scan_hole_backward(&mapping->page_tree,
-                                                       offset, ra_max);
+                                                       offset - 1, ra_max);
Here (offset >= 1) always holds.

It's a prime number. Should be made obvious by the following macro:
#define CACHE_HIT_HASH_KEY      29      /* some prime number */
