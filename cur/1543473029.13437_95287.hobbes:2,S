I've experienced bad checksum storms (short ones, though) on both a plain
PPP connection to my ISP (IBM, as it happens), and on an emulated PPP
connection using slirp (some people still use that... yes).
It doesn't indicate all that much (as some bad checksums could be real),
but it appears as if hardware is not an issue here.
Last time I got a storm like that was when ftped the mozzila-newlayout
thingie from the official ftp, by the way.
