You are right, I've already realized that. :-)
The struct pci_bus * arg to legacy_ioport_remap (maybe better
pci_legacy_ioport_remap) is really good idea, and it's perfectly
ok to pass NULL in the vgacon case - we are limited to only one
VGA console anyway.
After the PCI setup is done, pci_legacy_ioport_remap(pbus, &legacy_resource)
would solve any problem I can think of, including multiple ISA bridges.
