I uploaded here a new patch since I noticed a little bug and that alpha
doesn't need such gap since on alpha the stack is _before_ the heap (since
there is plenty of user-virtual space the stack has only for itself more
than 4giga of virtual space usable). Of course alpha will stack overflow
after 4giga of stack are been used. This has to be fixed too but it's not
a problem for now.
