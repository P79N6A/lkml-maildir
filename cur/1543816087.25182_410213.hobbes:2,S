I agree it probably may be improved.  Still it seems to be good enough.  Further,
it's more efficient than the previous solution, so I consider it as an improvement.
Also this code has been tested for quite some time in -mm and appears to
behave properly, at least we haven't got any bug reports related to it so far.
Currently I'm not working on any better solution.  If you can provide any
patches to implement one, please submit them, but I think they'll have to be
tested for as long as this code, in -mm.
Greetings,
Rafael
