There I disagree. Threads introduce parallelism that the majority of user
space programmers have trouble getting right (not that C is helpful here).
A threaded program has a set of extremely complex hard to repeat timing based
behaviour dependancies. An unthreaded app almost always does the same thing on
the same input. From a verification and coverage point of view that is 
incredibly important.
