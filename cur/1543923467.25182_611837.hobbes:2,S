Actually, it is possible, even for NUMA systems with CPUs running off
completely different oscillators, and in the presence of CPU frequency
changes, power management, and even in the presence of thermal
throttling (though the latter introduces temporary inaccuracies it
doesn't affect monotonicity or rate).
Take a look at the Xen code to see how each physical CPU is
independently calibrated on an ongoing basis, how movement of VCPUs
between physical CPUs is tracked, and how shared variables are used to
ensure montonicity if a guest requires it. 
The fixed-rate TSCs on newer CPUs make some of this stuff easier, but
you still need to cope with different source oscillators and some power
management states.
