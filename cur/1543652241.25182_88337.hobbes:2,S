No movement, and I don't particular see there's going to be any movement
on this one.  There are too many variables that changed around the time
that the serial code went in to allow the cause to be isolated.

Awaiting feedback from Andrew Walrond; the code as of 2.5.46 allows
better remote debugging of wrong/mis-detections.

Not my problem - it looks like something else is trampling on %ebx,
although Zwane/myself are at a loss to locate the cause of that.
(%ebx = "up" pointer, which must have been valid a few instructions
previous to even get to this point in the code.  Could it be a compiler
bug?)
