Thanks, now I see why you use swiotlb for such devices in the case of
end_pfn > MAX_DMA32_PFN and no_dma_ops works for them in the case of
of end_pfn < MAX_DMA32_PFN.
Can we put a pointer to dma_ops in struct device (archdata) like POWER
does? The way to setup and handle x86 IOMMUs seems to become hacky day
by day.
