Subject: [PATCH] ia64: change defconfig to NR_CPUS==1024
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/5/411

Increase the generic ia64 config from its current max of 512 CPUs to a
new max of 1024 CPUs.
The principal file change that implements this is arch/ia64/defconfig,
which currently defines CONFIG_NR_CPUS=512.  The change to
arch/ia64/Kconfig brings that file's declaration of the NR_CPUS default
up to the new reality of 1024.  That Kconfig currently says
    default "64"
which is bogus -- it is currently 512.
The recent change to arch/ia64/configs/sn2_defconfig just raised that
platform-specific defconfig to ==1024.
The rationale for increasing the generic ia64 defconfig to 1024 is that
the generic config needs to support the new upcoming max CPU count for
ia64 platforms, which for ia64/sn ("Altix") platform is 1024, just as
the current max of 512 supports the current max CPU count.
The downside is that the ia64 cpumask increases from 8 words to 16.
I have tried various heavy workloads and have seen no significant
measurable performance regression from this increase.  The potential
extra cachemiss seems to be lost in the noise.  The for_each_*cpu()
macros are relatively efficient in skipping past zeroed cpumask bits.
Workloads that impose higher loads on the CPU Scheduler tend to
bottleneck on non-Scheduler parts of the kernel, and it's the Scheduler
which makes the principal use of the cpumask_t, so these extra
cachemiss inefficiencies and extra CPU cycles to scan zero mask words
just get lost in the general system overhead.
