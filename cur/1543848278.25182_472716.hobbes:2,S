I'm just trying to localize the issue. 
Since right before machine stalls during reboot I see something like
ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 000:00:19.0 disabled
Restarting system.
and this device is Gb ethernet, e1000 is perfect candidate to look at. And yes, removing e1000
before reboot works around the issue.
I'm afraid this is now common issue across Intel 965 board series, at least with their latest BIOS
updates.
Aleks.
