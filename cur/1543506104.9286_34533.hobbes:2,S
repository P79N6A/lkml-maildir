No.  Go read the securelevel code in 2.0.  The highest securelevel (3,
I think) bans writes to block devices.  I think that it also blocks
mount calls, so read-only filesystems would be protected, too.

No.  Examine securelevels or the capability stuff (esp. the securelevel-
like bounding set) in 2.2+.  root's power can be constrained.  It _does_
stop people doing bad things.

Why?  If I can disable module loading, promiscuous network operation and
a few nasty filesystem things _even for root_ then the risk to my network
of a compromised machine is greatly reduced.

Following that argument, perhaps I should run Apache as root?  Oracle?
