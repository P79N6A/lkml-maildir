You may understand the VFS better than I do actually.

I'm not sure to understand your suggestion. Is this:
1) for mkdir(), create the non-default group, but without its default groups,
and defer their creation to a worker which won't have constraints on locks held
by any caller;
2) for rmdir(), unlink the non-default group, but without unlinking its default
groups, and defer the recursive work to a lock-free context?
For mkdir(), this may work. Maybe a bit confusing for userspace, since mkdir(A)
returns as soon as A is created, but A may be populated later and userspace may
rely on A being populated as soon as it is created (current behavior). As a
configfs user, this makes my life harder...
For rmdir(), is this safe to unlink a non-empty directory, and to empty it
afterwards? This looks like going back to the unmount problem.
Thanks,
Louis
