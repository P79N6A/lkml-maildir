It seems we are holding the rsv_block while searching the bitmap for a
free bit.  In alloc_new_reservation(), we first find a available to
create a reservation window, then we check the bitmap to see if it
contains any free block. If not, we will search for next available
window, so on and on. During the whole process we are holding the global
rsv_lock.  We could, and probably should, avoid that.  Just unlock the
rsv_lock before the bitmap search and re-grab it after it.  We need to
make sure that the available space that are still available after we re-
grab the lock. 
Another option is to hold that available window before we release the
rsv_lock, and if there is no free bit inside that window, we will remove
it from the tree in the next round of searching for next available
window.
I prefer the second option, and plan to code it up soon. Any comments?
Thanks,
Mingming
