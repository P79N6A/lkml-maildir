I've not been testing 2.5 yet and perhaps some of what you
said would make more sense if i had but i for one haven't a
clue to what the string equivalent to "sb=0x220,7,1,5" would
be or where i might specify it.  It's been a couple of years
since i did the digging to figure out i needed the sb= line
and what the contents should be.
How to do this needs to go into the 2.4-2.6 migration
document/FAQ.  And it should go in in a rather explicit way
on the order of "if for SB16 you have been using
sb=0x220,7,1,5 as a boot parameter you would now need to use
XXXX=XXXXXXXXXX as ZZZZZ.
