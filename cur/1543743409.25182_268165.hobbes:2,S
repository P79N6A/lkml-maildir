No.  Compile time options are evil.
There is a insmod option for that (tuner=<nr>) since ages because that
is a common issue with tv cards that they are shipped with different
tuners in different regions of the world and it isn't allways known
how to figure which one actually is used.
Just put "option bttv tuner=whatever" into your modprobe.conf and be
done with it.
