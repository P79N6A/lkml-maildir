Oh, they have one very useful feature: Take a machine with multiple
10baseT network interfaces that needs Linux installing over a network
to it. The easiest way is simply to connect all of the network
interfaces to the same BNC cable, then it doesnae matter which one
gets used to download...
Best wishes from Riley.
