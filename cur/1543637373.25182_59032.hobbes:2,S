	IrDA is not going to get fixed soon. Over the time I've been
fixing the IrDA stack, I've slowly fixed some of most dangerous
locking problems, but fixing the remaining code will involve some
serious re-work and is unfortunately not just about sprinking a few
spinlocks there and there.
	That's life...
