The "mixed" drivers/ide and drivers/scsi setup for the ICH is really
ugly (look at the pci/quirks.c code for it to see just *how* ugly). It
is still present but the default behaviour at the moment is to assume
that you want to use libata for your drives.
For most distros I've tried this doesn't seem to break anything. Some
older distros don't use labels for root searching so need root= passing
the first time to fix it.
That bit of code is really Jeff code but I can certainly put a Kconfig
line and submit a diff to allow users to pick whether their PIIX/ICH
should be handled half and half if Andrew or Jeff think that is wise.
