okay, i've done this now and pushed out the resulting tree to 
tip/cpus4096-v2. It is a no-content-changed reshuffle of the tail ~10 
commits of tip/cpus4096:
 $ git diff cpus4096..cpus4096-v2
 $
i dropped the two broken patches i bisected today, and backmerged a fixlet 
to make it more bisectable, and reordered fixes next to the merge point - 
and the new changes now come after that.
this finally is something that has no known regressions and looks pushable 
to Linus. I've started the -tip tests, lets see how well this holds up 
now.
