Hi everyone,
Perhaps it is only a one liner, but the bttv modules for the Hauppauge
WinTV are crashing the whole computer 1 or 2 seconds after insmoding
bttv.o (alt+sysreq+b for reboot works, no log entries). This is true
for the bttv drivers from xawtv-2.32 as for the ones included in the
kernel source. 
Kernel Version 2.2-pre7 and a lot of previous kernels worked really
fine together with the bttv driver from xawtv-2.32. No hangs, no
crashes, everything worked just great.
My setup:
Computer: Dual P100 on a Tyan Tomcat II (430HX), SMP Kernel. 
Rest of hardware: Ethernet controller DEC 21143, Matrox Millenium I,
Adaptec 2940 with 4 devices/2 disk drives, Soundblaster
AWE32. Interrupt configuration is:
           CPU0       CPU1
  0:     349215          0          XT-PIC  timer
  1:       5794       5833    IO-APIC-edge  keyboard
  2:          0          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  4:      19596      19630    IO-APIC-edge  serial
  7:        628        636    IO-APIC-edge  soundblaster
  8:          2          0    IO-APIC-edge  rtc
 10:       3721       3636   IO-APIC-level  aic7xxx
 12:      85487      86975   IO-APIC-level  bttv
 13:          1          0          XT-PIC  fpu
 15:      12900      13495   IO-APIC-level  DC21143 (eth0)
On 2.2-pre7 the modules say during insmod:
Linux video capture interface: v0.01 ALPHA
i2c: initialized
i2c: driver registered: tuner
i2c: driver registered: msp3400
bttv0: Brooktree Bt848 (rev 17) bus: 0, devfn: 136, irq: 12, memory:
       0xe2000000.
bttv: 1 Bt8xx card(s) found.
bttv0: Hauppauge eeprom: tuner=Phillips FM1216 (5)
bttv0: model: BT848(Hauppauge old)
i2c: bus registered: bt848-0
i2c: device attached: tuner (addr=0xc2, bus=bt848-0, driver=tuner)
msp3400: init: chip=MSP3400C-C6
i2c: device attached: MSP3400C-C6 (addr=0x80, bus=bt848-0, driver=msp3400) 
Perhaps someone has the same problem with 2.2-final and a Hauppauge
WinTV board?
