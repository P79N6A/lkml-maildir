Hi,
Thanks for your response.
Well, I now recompiled all the kernels I used with all possible
permutations of these options (yes, that did take the better part of
last week).
I can confirm that under identical option for the preemption model, and
timer frequency, the following happen:
    1. With 2.6.19 (gentoo-r5), the system claims to use 0% CPU when
       idle.
    2. With 2.6.21 (gentoo-r4), 2.6.22 (gentoo-r1) and the unmodified
       2.6.22.1 kernel, the system claims to use between 1% and 3% CPU
       when idle.
When I run "top", I see that all non-idle processes running claim to
take 0% CPU (except occasionally the terminal I'm running top in, and
top itself). The CPU line in the top output consistently claims
something like
    CPU(s): .3%us, 1.0%sy, ...
I'm not sure if this is something I should be worried about or not,
Thanks again,
Gautam
