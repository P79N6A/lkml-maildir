This is only for 3.5 reiserfs format (default for 2.2 kernels), for 3.6
format, generation is stored on the disk (in the same place where rdev
is stored for device files). 3.5 cannot work with nfs reliably.
Hans-Peter, you can check version of reiserfs you use with
/sbin/debugreiserfs /dev/device
or 
cat /proc/fs/reiserfs/device/version

In reiserfs there is no static inode table, so we keep global generation
counter in a super block which is incremented on each inode deletion,
this generation is stored in the new inodes. Not that good as per-inode
generation, but we cannot do better without changing disk format.
