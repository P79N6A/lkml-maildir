Subject: [PATCH] APM patch for 2.2.0-pre4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/1/5/75

Hi Linus,
This is the second part of a patch I sent to you for 2.1.131 that
seems top have got lost.  It does:
	- Add CONFIG_APM_RTC_IS_GMT (Richard Gooch <rgooch@atnf.csiro.au>)
	- change APM_NOINTS to CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS (Suggested by many
	  as it is needed to make the newer Thinkpads suspend without
	  hanging)
	- remove dependency on CONFIG_PROC_FS (since the bits of proc_fs
	  we need are now always present)
	- slight fix to the way CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_SUSPEND_BOUNCE
	  is implemented
These changes are very minor and the two new config options
are off by default which gives the old behaviour.
Cheers,
Stephen

 Ignore multiple suspend/resume cycles
 CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_SUSPEND_BOUNCE
-  This option is necessary on the Dell Inspiron 3200, but should be
-  safe for all other laptops. When enabled, a system suspend event
-  that occurs within one second of a resume is ignored. Without this
-  the Inspiron will shut itself off a few seconds after you open the
-  lid, requiring you to press the power button to resume it a second
-  time.
+  This option is necessary on the Dell Inspiron 3200 and others, but
+  should be safe for all other laptops. When enabled, a system suspend
+  event that occurs within one second of a resume is ignored. Without
+  this the Inspiron will shut itself off a few seconds after you open
+  the lid, requiring you to press the power button to resume it a
+  second time.
   Say Y.
+
+RTC stores time in GMT
+CONFIG_APM_RTC_IS_GMT
+  This option can be used when your RTC (Real Time Clock aka. Hardware
+  Clock) stores the time in GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) rather than
+  localtime. When suspending/resuming, the kernel needs to know what
+  is stored in the RTC so it can update the system clock (which is
+  always GMT). Without this option the kernel attempts to measure
+  the offset between the RTC and the system clock. This means you
+  can loose one second on each suspend/resume cycle.
+  Also, on the Dell Inspiron 3200, the hardware slows down the system
+  even before the kernel can measure the RTC/system clock offset. It
+  can then take 15 seconds to do this measurement and it can be
+  incorrect by several seconds.
+  Say Y if GMT is stored in your RTC.
+  GMT is usually the best anyway, because you don't have to worry about
+  daylight savings time changes. The only reason to not use GMT in
+  your RTC is if you also run a broken OS that doesn't understand GMT.
+
+Allow interrupts during APM BIOS calls
+CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS
+  Normally we disable external interrupts while we are making calls to
+  the APM BIOS as a measure to lessen the effects of a badly behaving
+  BIOS implementation.  The BIOS should reeanble interrupts if it
+  needs to.  Unfortunately, some BIOS's do not - especially those in
+  many of the newer IBM Thinkpads.  If you experience hangs when you
+  suspend, try setting this to Y.  Otherwise, say N.
