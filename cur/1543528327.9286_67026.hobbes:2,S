	Invented, hardly.  Checksumming/hashing is really easy in this
sort of scheme.
foreach file
    sum = md5sum(file)
    if in_hash(sum)
        remove(file)
    else
        add_to_hash(sum, 1);
done
	My understanding of the press release is that they have a method
for link()/readlink(), and a program similar to the above that can be
run by the administrator to link() duplicate files.
	To do this live and automagically as the system is running
obviously takes more effort, but the concept is the same.  Personally, I
wouldn't want my identical files linked unless I know about it.
Otherwise, I'm changing three files when I think I am changing one.
	Then, of course, they could do COW on that set of links.  But
that adds even more complexity.  And I have no way of discerning from
the press release whether that is the case.
