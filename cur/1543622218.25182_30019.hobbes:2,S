Oh that works fine.   But then it's a global counter, so each time
a CPU marks a page dirty, the counter needs to be pulled out of
another CPU's cache.   Which is not a thing I *need* to do.
As I said, it's a micro-issue.  But it's a requirement which 
may pop up elsewhere.

yup.  It'd probably work - the compiler should calculate the address and
do a non-buslocked but IRQ-atomic increment on it.  But no way can we
rely on that happening.

If the compiler produced code equivalent to
	counter[smp_processor_id()] = counter[smp_processor_id()] + 1;
then the counter would get trashed - a context switch could cause CPUB
to write CPUA's counter (+1) onto CPUB's counter.  It's quite possibly
illegal for the compiler to evaluate the array subscript twice in this
manner.  Dunno.
If the compiler produced code equivalent to:
	const int cpu = smp_processor_id();
	counter[cpu] = counter[cpu] + 1;
(which is much more likely) then a context switch would result
in CPUB writing CPUA's updated counter onto CPUA's counter.  Which
will work a lot more often, until CPUA happens to be updating its
counter at the same time.

Sure.
