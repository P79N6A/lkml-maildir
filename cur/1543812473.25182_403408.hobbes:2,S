 RTC subsystem. 
 Original RFC available at 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/12/20/220
 Changelog. Between parentheses is the name
 of the person that suggested the change.
 - moved generic functions to rtc-lib.c, compiled
 only if CONFIG_RTC_LIB. Any code that relies on those
 functions must "select" that symbol. (Andrew Morton)
 - Fixed a bug in set_mmss (Richard Knutsson, Benoit Boissinot)
 - Added entries to CREDITS and MAINTAINERS
 The following patches have been incorporated:
 - mips-fixed-collision-of-rtc-function-name.patch
   Fix the collision of rtc function name (Yoichi Yuasa)
 - drivers-rtc-make-some-structs-static.patch
   drivers/rtc/: make some structs static (Adrian Bunk)
 The following items are in the TODO:
 - Documentation of exported functions
 - Handling of max_user_freq
 - 11 min ntp update mode
