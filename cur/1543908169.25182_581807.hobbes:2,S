This is not a bug. You have to keep in mind that for hrtimer to make a 
real difference HIGH_RES_TIMERS has to be enabled, OTOH if HZ is already 
set to 1000, it doesn't make much difference.
The sleep was and will be only a minimum time, expecting something 
different is actually a bug.

As I tried to say before this is foremost an API issue. Introducing 
nanosleep() makes it clear that this user will benefit from enabling 
HIGH_RES_TIMERS, whereas msleep() says that resolution is not that 
important and thus it will work fine without HIGH_RES_TIMERS and/or 
HZ_1000.
