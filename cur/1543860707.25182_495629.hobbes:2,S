 Too late, I've started memtest-86+.  If it seems ok after an
overnight run, I'll take a look at /proc/interrupts.  How can I tell
it is in IOAPIC mode, please ?  Google was not helpful for this, but
if it's an override, the only things on my command lines are root=
and video= settings.
 Certainly, it seems likely that the configs could be fairly
different in their detail.
