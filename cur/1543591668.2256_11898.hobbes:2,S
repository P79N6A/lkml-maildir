But /dev/sda/offset=234234,limit=626737537 isn't a file! ls it and see
if it's there. writing to files that aren't shown in directory listings
is plain evil. I really don't want to explain why. It's extremely
messy and unintuitive.
It would be better to do this with a file that does exist, for example
writing something to /proc/disks/sda/arguments. Then again, I don't
even think much of dynamic file systems in the first place.
