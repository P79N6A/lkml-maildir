Ah, good point. That should also be the reason why a battery inserted
after module loading won't get noticed (I didn't try right now, but I
remember complains about that).
I wonder whether the "!device->status.present" condition can just be
deleted here or checking for device HIDs that potentially can be
ejected/inserted, not sure. Hopefully someone else could comment on that
one.

Yeah, therefore the mem_device cannot be passed as callback data as it
might get generated in the notify handler func and all the additional
stuff is needed..., ouch.

It's me who is wrong, thanks a lot for checking!

I feared something like that (should have add a comment...), as the EJ0
and _STA functions are only used on the device itself I thought checking
for them makes sense, but for a missing EJ0 func powering down the
device just fails and it should not be harmful.
So the only useful thing from my patch (as long as .add is only invoked
if device is present) is using the general acpi_bus_get_status() func. 
Hmm, it must be used if the _STA function on the memory device is also
missing and the parent _STA must be used then? Could make sense on a
machine where a whole node must be inserted/ejected? The
acpi_bus_get_status() function already contains the checking for the
parent's _STA function and uses this one if the device itself has none.
