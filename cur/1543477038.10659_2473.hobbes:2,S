Right, the new behavior is intended to exactly match SunOS/Solaris and is
should be more consistent with the rest of UNIX in general.  The old
behavior was highly nonstandard and made group-controlled permissions on
directories (e.g. with CVS) rather impractical (and for that matter didn't
even match its own comments or man page).
I consulted POSIX and UNIX98 as well, but they did not have anything to say
about root doing chown and chgrp, so I went for "standard UNIX practice".
I'm also skeptical there is any compelling security reason to drop setuid
when root is doing a chown/chgrp, if root can chown it root can just as
well chmod it again afterwards.  Also, if root chowning causes bits in
permissions to be cleared, it can result in some utilities not preserving
permissions as expected when doing copies and restores (depending on the
order the utility does the chown and chmod in).
Paraphrasing from POSIX.1/UNIX98 by Andrew Josey of TOG:

Anyone care to check behavior on *BSD, Digital/Compaq UNIX, HP/UX,
UnixWare, AIX, etc.?  Don't forget, directories are treated different from
files and sgid bits may be treated differently from suid bits.
