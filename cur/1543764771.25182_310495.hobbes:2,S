Andreas is right, his patches are needed.
Currently, if your laptop is stolen after resume, they can still data
in swsusp image.
Zeroing the swsusp pages helps a lot here, because at least they are
not getting swsusp image data without heavy tools. [Or think root
compromise month after you used swsusp.]
Encrypting swsusp image is of course even better, because you don't
have to write large ammounts of zeros to your disks during resume ;-).
