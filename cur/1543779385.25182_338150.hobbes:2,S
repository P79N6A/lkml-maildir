Lots of small files->slow; it is an LTO-2 tape drive that is spec'd
at 35MByte/s - it won't get that if I'm feeding it from something
seeking all over.

I could - but they are a pain at restore time.

I'll be honest I don't know; this was running with 9 streams; but 
I know the overall speed of the backup goes up as I increase
the parallelism from 5 through 9 - but it still sucks.

When I fsck it fixes it - this to me is an indication something is wrong
with the ondisc data; now it might only be the freespace totals - but
the fact that the disc contents are wrong makes me worry - I don't
like having to fsck a 1.5TB partition.

Write cache is on in the 3ware bios as is the battery backup.

Erm I guess I could - but the controller does manage
60/70MB/s write as a raw stream, so as far as I can tell if I can
persuade the kernel not to chop my writes into silly small
chunks things should be good.
