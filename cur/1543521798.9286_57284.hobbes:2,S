The only thing that I would add is that you might want to try the latest
development kernel.  It is possible that there is some reserved space in the
system below the 192M point, and this can cause problems if it is not
properly reserved.  The e820 map will see & avoid these areas.  There is a
problem right now with memory in the 0x0A0000 - 0x100000 region, but it can
be hacked around on a case-by-case basis for now.

So it's brand-spank new motherboard then. It's normal. There was original
old int15 function to detect memory. With 64MiB limitation. Then new
version was added (801). And shortly after that still never version was
developed (820). Quite a few vendors decided that since Windows98 supports
very recent function it's enough to implement only it (first one used by
some versions of DOS's HIMEM so it should be supported anyway).
Unfortunatelly only kernel 2.3 has support for latest function while 2.2
supports first two (while first two will report only amount of available
memory latest one returns complex table with different available memory
regions and so it's not trivial to support it).
