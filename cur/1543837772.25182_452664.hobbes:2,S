Here's a more detailed explanation:
All the low level LPC register access is publicly documented in the
manual of the embedded controller. See [1] and in particular [2]. The
submitted thinkpad_ec code just follows these specs (very defensively
with and a lot of extra status checks, because some EC hangs were
reported in older versions). The only remaining information is about
the accelerometer-specific commands implemented by the firmware; the
public APS spec [3] and the mainline code based on this already
contain most of the this information, and a few corrections and
extentions were gleaned from the reverse-engineered the firmware code
[4]. If case you're wondering about the "opaque" function,
hdaps_check_ec(), then note that it's just code from the original
hdaps driver (following [3]) that's translated to use thinkpad_ec
instead of direct IO port access.
> Was it improperly obtained from NDA'ed documentation?
Absolutely not. I've never signed any NDA remotely related to this.
(and why I do so when the above sources already contain all the needed
information?)
BTW, I can't help wondering: do you have a similarly detailed account
for an appreciable fraction of the driver code in mainline?

Sure, we can do this. Actually I've alredy e-mailed Linus to this
effect several days ago, before realizing he's off-line.

How following the DCO's chain-of-trust model?
