Odd, I thought the help text was originally far more helpful, including
a url.  The message isn't telling you you need a kernel module, but that
you are using an old libcap.  It isn't a real problem right now if
you're not using the SMACK LSM, but to get rid of the message upgrade
your libcap from
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/security/linux-privs/kernel-2.6/libcap-2.05.tar.gz
