I get the following errors when booting 2.5.68:
evevent-0286: ***Error: No installed handler for fixed event [00000000]
evevent-0286: ***Error: No installed handler for fixed event [00000003]
evgpe-0396: Error: acpi_ev_gpe_dispatch: No handler or method for GPE[ 0], disabling event
evgpe-0396: Error: 
And the kernel locks up hard.  Have to hit the reset switch.  These
  messages come just after mounting / readonly (thus, no logs exist;
  had to copy these down by hand).
This is on a Toshiba Satellite 1605CDS.  I'll try to provide whatever info
  I can, if you tell me what to look for (and I can find it; a lot goes
  by very fast)
