Well, that feature summary is pretty superficial and completely useless to me
and certainly to other folks that are more technical than the average IRC script
kiddie.

I'd like URL to check this out and I'm also curious as to why no one has talked
about it actively on linux-kernel when folks gripe about select()/poll() as and
alternative method for listened to file descriptors.

He's right though, select()/poll() is pretty bogus. Using expensive "greater than"
linear search structures pretty backward.
