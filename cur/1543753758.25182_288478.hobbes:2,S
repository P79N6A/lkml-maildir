Now, I'm confused. :-)  It's roughly this:
struct pbe *pbe = pagedir_nosave, *end;
unsigned n = nr_copy_pages;
if (n) {
	end = pbe + n;
	do {
		memcpy((void *)pbe->orig_address, (void *)pbe->address, PAGE_SIZE);
		pbe++;
	} while (pbe < end);
}
where memcpy() is of course a hand-written inline that includes the cr3 manipulation,
and pbe, end, n are registers.

Yes, it is.

Now, that's clear. :-)
Anyway, if anyone could test it or look at it and say a word, please do so.
Greets,
