i presume then i shouldn't be using IRQF_SHARED, if using MSI.
Another question would be if the device supports multiple messages, MSIX
should be used ?
In such a context, if i request for say more than the messages that i
need, say i request 16 messages, but use only 1 or 2, that does bear any
consequences ?

I should probably look for CONFIG_PCI_MSI and check whether the system
supports MSI pci_enable_msi() ?
