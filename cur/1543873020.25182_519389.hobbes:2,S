Within reason, yes.  Defining "reason" is difficult.  As we speak, this
is possible to a much greater degree than with RSDL.  Before anybody
pipes in, yes, I'm very much aware of the down side of the interactivity
estimator, I've waged bloody battles with it, and have the t-shirt :)

Virtual or physical cores has nothing to do with the interactivity
regression I noticed.  Two nice 0 tasks which combined used 50% of my
box can no longer share that box with two nice 5 tasks and receive the
50% they need to perform.  That's it. From there, we wandered off into a
discussion on the relative merit and pitfalls of fairness.
