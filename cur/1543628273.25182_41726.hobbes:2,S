I already did both, and posted the results.  I put considerable energy into
it, and I am not going to put more time into it.  If you want to dispute my
(unscientific) results then please repeat my survey or carry out one in
accordance with your own, presumably higher standards.

True.  I suspect somebody can just look at some statistics somewhere to know
that.  Personally, I don't know how to do that efficiently and I'm not going
to do it.  I'll speculate though: I guess that BK patches outnumber GNU
patches by more than a factor of 3.

Right.  I made the conjecture, if you wish to verify/disprove it then feel
free.  I did my share of the work already.
