Ok?  More reading seems necessary before I can follow you here...

Are these different forms of page aging described in written form
somewhere?

Or simply declare higher-order atomic allocations to be undesired?
Not sure how many of those we have that make sense.

There is a related problem I'm sure you are aware of.  Trying to
shrink the dentry_cache or the various foofs_inode_caches we remove
tons of objects before a full slab (in most cases a page) is free and
can be returned.  ext3_inode_cache has 8 objects per slab,
dentry_cache has 29.  That's the equivalent of an order-3 or order-5
page allocation in terms of inefficiency.
And having just started thinking about the problem, my envisioned
solution looks fairly similar to Andy's work for high-order
allocations here.  Except that I cannot think in terms of "scanning",
afaict.
