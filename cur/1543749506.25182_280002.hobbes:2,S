Even in 2.4 you do not need make clean. make dep should suffice if you changed 
some includes.
I dislike how many FAQs and tutorials always add "do a make clean"... that 
requires you to recompile everything (read: may take "some time", when in 
practice you only need a few things (i'm speaking generally, any app is 
considered).
