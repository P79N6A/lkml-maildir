Note also: this is a feature.
I have a little helper program which can grab or release a futex in a
(mmapped) file.  It's great for shell scripts to grab locks.  In this
case the helper exits with the lock held, and a later invocation
releases a lock it never held.
*AND* the lock is persistent across reboots, since it's in a file.
How cool is that!
This is the *third* major thread on this subject, BTW.
Rusty.
