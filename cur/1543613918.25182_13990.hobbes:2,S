Well, you certainly won't get errors, because compiler optimizations
shouldn't change expected syntax.
-O2 is the standard optimization level for the kernel; everything is
compiled via it.  When developers test their code, nuances that the
optimization introduce are accepted.  Removing the optimization may
break those expectations.  Thus the kernel requires it.
