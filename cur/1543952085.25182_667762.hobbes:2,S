Yes, kernel<->user interface is something like that. Try evtest to see
it.

PS/2 keyboard sends both ups and downs. "down down down up" means
autorepeat. It is not actually ambiguous.
BTW this is what I use to generate huge latencies and cause X
problems:
void
main(void)
{
        int i;
        iopl(3);
        while (1) {
                asm volatile("cli");
                //              for (i=0; i<20000000; i++)
                for (i=0; i<1000000000; i++)
                        asm volatile("");
                asm volatile("sti");
                sleep(1);
        }
}
...run it once per core.
