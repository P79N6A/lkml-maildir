The application that I'm working with 'works', in the sense that when I 
do a 'ps' there are several processes
listed under the app name, corresponding to the created threads.
When I run gdb with the app, it does load /lib/libthread_db.so.1, so my 
presumption here is that gdb has
been thread enabled.
Since the app is pretty portable, and I've been using NetBSD to develop 
co-develop it, I can run gdb
on the NetBSD side, and 'things' seem to work better. There are still 
some wyrd operational issues
on the NetBSD, but at least when I set a break point in a thread, it 
works, and when I do a
'info threads' command to gdb, it gives a reasonable out put of the list 
of threads. Since the NetBSD
implementation of threads is 'new' to the kernel, I do expect some problems.
Now, because the thread implementation is different between NetBSD and 
Linux, and it seems that Linux
creates distinct 'processes' for the threads, I'm wondering if I have 
not correctly configured my kernel,
or if there is something special one has to do to allow gdb to write to 
one of the created thread processes.
Also, I do believe I'm using the NPTL package for threads. Is there a 
way to absolutely tell without
question?
Thanks
John Clark
