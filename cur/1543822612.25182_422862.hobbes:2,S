Hello,
is project acpi4asus still alive? (I'm asking here whether Andrew or Linus are
receiving patches from acpi guys). For me, it looks like this is somewhat dead.
I posted patch to include Asus M6A support to both lkm and acpi4asus list but no
response. I only noticed, that Andrew once tried to include in -mm but I did not
see it there anyway.
