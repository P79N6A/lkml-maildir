Thanks a lot Zwane, appreciate these tips !
I am now trying to be better prepared for my next 4gb test, and
have been working on a small program that should "eat memory".
I'm not sure I am doing the right thing though ...
The idea was to create an app that would consume a lot of memory
without touching any other system resources.
At first I used ksysguard to watch the memory consumption.
Interestingly enough, it was "wired": The VmSize column seems
to jump randomly, once I get 1,051 than I will see 3,148,615
than I will get 2,789 than I might see 1,073,976 than it will
give me 3,148 .... all during the same run of my mem eater app.
... just mentioning it here in case there is a connection between
my problem and this wired display ...
Now this testing was done with 2GB at first ... no kernel panics
with 2GB.
Than I decided to use /proc/meminfo, but that suggests that I
am not using all memory at all ! With 2GB malloc fails after
510 iterations (510 MB ???) ... (I have a 10GB swap partition)
And /proc/meminfo confirms that:
MemTotal:      2056528 kB
MemFree:       1526424 kB
About 1/2 gig is used, I checked limits, and that said unlimited ...
What else can block memory usage ? May be I just need to start my
app several times ?!
Hmm, after forking mem eater 6 times I get:
MemTotal:      2056528 kB
MemFree:        610000 kB
Which is almost the same as after 4 and 5 spins ...
Any ideas/suggestion ?
Thanks a lot guys & gals !
Kind Regards,
rudi
