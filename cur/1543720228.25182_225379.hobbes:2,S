What I and Måns Rullgård are saying is this: A symlink to object directory
is missing. The fix is to add the damn symlink. However, breaking symlink to
source directory at the same time is unacceptable.
In other words:
build  ->  Symlink to kernel sources and build machinery, Makefiles and
           scripts. No change here.
object ->  Symlink to separate object tree. This is new.
Existing functionality when using separate source and object directories is
that only the 'build' symlink exists, and that points to kernel build
machinery. And that 'build' symlink must stay that way.

All code that uses the 'build' symlink needs to be changed if Andreas' patch
is merged to mainline. That is quite breakage.
Sam, you are wrong here. I hope you have enough balls to admit that instead
of forcing everyone to deal with the proposed breakage.
