Hi all,
Here's a little patch to fix the 2.4.17 PCMCIA to make linear flash
cards work. The patch should work with all the recent kernels.
Linear flash card are rarely used, but are needed to boot some embedded
systems, like the AMD ELAN. They are also used in some Cisco routers.
Just FYI, here's some Linux related projects where linear flash cards 
may be used:
Wireless access points running Linux:

Alios boot loader for AMD ELAN:
http://www.telos.de/linux/alios/default_e.htm
Read Cisco flash cards from Linux: 
ftp://ftp.bbc.co.uk/pub/ciscoflash/
I'm CC'ing dhinds, as I guess he's taking care of the PCMCIA in 
the kernel?
Here's a short description of the fix:
Basically there were two problems; The RegisterMTD ioctl was
accidentally dropped at some point, so the flash cards would not
register. Then the reference to the flash card memory window was   
incorrect, so the cards were not seen, and the flash drivers would 
not unload after use.
Cheers,
Tony
