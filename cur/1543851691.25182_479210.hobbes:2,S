Subject: [GIT PATCH] PCI fixes for 2.6.19-rc4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/3/173

Here are two PCI bug fixes.
One is a revert of a previous patch that had caused some PCI problems for
suspend/resume.  The other one marks PCI_MULTITHREAD_PROBE depend on
CONFIG_BROKEN to make it so that users don't have so many problems with the
2.6.19 release (because we all know that they don't read the help text for new
config options very carefully at times...)
Please pull from:
	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/pci-2.6.git/
or if master.kernel.org hasn't synced up yet:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/pci-2.6.git/
The full patches will be sent to the linux-pci mailing list, if anyone
wants to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
