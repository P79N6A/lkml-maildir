I guess the cleanest solution would be to use the same routine in either case. 
If that was a pseudo driver, it would mean double the memory usage (the pages 
allocated would also be atomically copied), so perhaps using 
swsusp_add_arch_pages is the way to go.
I wonder too whether Mel Gorman e820 table patches could be leveraged to make 
finding the NVS data really nice and simple?
