It was claimed that something that was CONFIG_XXX=N could never affect
excisting code. Furthermore, a newbie would be able to fix the kernel in
half an hour. Well, the newbie might screw up, or the CONFIG_XXX could be
implemented wrong, or there might me subtle interactions that get broken by
the included/excluded code.

Never said anything like that. I have the highest respect for Richard
Gooch, I just think the _concept_ of a dynamic /dev is mistaken. BTW, there
has been some heavy criticism on the code too here.
