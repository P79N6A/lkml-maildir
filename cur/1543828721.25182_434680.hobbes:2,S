I shouldn't say much more costly.... Much more costly when looking
at the limit case (and we traditionally rather look at the common
case in Linux, and in those cases spinlocks _can_ be faster).
However in the limit, spinlocks scale O(N), while readlocks scale
O(1), where N is the number of CPUs trying to take the lock.
AFAIKS.
But if they're causing stability problems, I have no arguments
against converting them to spinlocks. It might even result in a
worldwide net saving of CPU cycles, for what that's worth ;)
