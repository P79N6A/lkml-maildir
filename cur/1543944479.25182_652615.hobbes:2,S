On the other hand, despite my brilliant (hah!) endorsement
of bit field flags in my reply a few minutes ago, I'd settle
for (1) removing the enum, and (2) using a flags field and
more defines for the new stuff.  I will grant that Christoph
is correct that that form is more common in the kernel, and
there is something to be said for doing things in the most
common manner.
