That impression is wrong in that general form. Both have advantages and
disadvantages.
I've been an advocate of seeing both of them merged, mostly because I
think it would be beneficial if they'd share the same interface to
user-space to make the tools easier to write and maintain.
However, rewriting the RAID personalities for DM is a thing only a fool
would do without really good cause. Sure, everybody can write a
RAID5/RAID6 parity algorithm. But getting the failure/edge cases stable
is not trivial and requires years of maturing.
Which is why I think gentle evolution of both source bases towards some
common API (for example) is much preferable to reinventing one within
the other.
Oversimplifying to "dm is better than md" is just stupid.
Sincerely,
    Lars Marowsky-Brée
