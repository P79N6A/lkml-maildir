Nope. They're going in different directions. We'd slow each other down.

You've lost me here.
My stuff is the opposite of what the interactivity stuff is trying
to do. The interactivity stuff _does_ kind of implement variable
timeslices in the form of re queueing stuff. I think it would be a
nightmare for them to put my variable timeslices on top of that and
then get it to all work properly.

My idea is to try to make it as simple as possible, and no
simpler (as a great man put it!). So more is less if you
know what I mean.
I think this is going against how the scheduler (and UNIX
schedulers in general) have generally behaved. Its very likely
that you'd be better off fixing your app / other broken bit
of kernel code though.
I don't know... maybe...

I'm not sure. I think the 1000HZ thing is mainly from timer interrupts.
The scheduler should be pretty well agnostic to the 100->1000 change,
other than having higher resolution. Increased context switches might
indicate something is not being scaled with HZ properly though.
Yes context switches are inefficient. The tradeoff is vs scheduling
latency and there is no way around that.
