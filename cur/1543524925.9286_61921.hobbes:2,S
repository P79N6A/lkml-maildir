Subject: [patch-2.3.43-p2] wrong speed set in drivers/cdrom/mcd.c

Hi,
Is the minimum value of "struct cdrom_device_info"->speed 2? If not, then
the following patch should be applied:
   
http://www.ocston.org/~tigran/patches/mcd-speed-2.3.43-p2.patch
Also, I removed initialization to 2 because the static initialization of
the structure already sets it to 2.
Regards,
Tigran
