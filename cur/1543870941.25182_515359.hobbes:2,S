Sorry for the newbie question, but is it adequate to do a:
	git reset --hard v2.6.21-rc2
To ensure a patch is "unreverted" (I reverted it with "git revert"), before 
applying your patch?
I've done so now, assuming this _will_ work. The reason I ask is that your 
diff was offset by 12 lines versus -rc2.
