2.95.x is basically buggered at present.  There's one scsi driver which
doesn't compile due to weird __VA_ARGS__ tricks and the rather useful
scsi/sd.c is currently getting an ICE.  None of the new SAS code compiles,
due to extensive use of anonymous unions.  The V4L guys are very good at
exploiting the gcc-2.95.x macro expansion bug (_why_ does each driver need
to implement its own debug macros?) and various people keep on sneaking in
anonymous unions.
It's time to give up on it and just drink more coffee or play more tetris
or something, I'm afraid.
