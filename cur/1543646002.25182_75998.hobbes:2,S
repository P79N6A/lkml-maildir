   Assume B has two network interfaces (B1 and B2) on seperate IPv4 links (net1 
   and net2). Host A is on net1 and Host C is on net2. Assume that both Host A 
   and Host C have the same autoconf address. So IP address is not enough 
   information for Host B to use to determine which interface to use in order to 
   contact Host A (instead of Host C).
   If host B has socket binding on IP+port+local interface, it all works out.
You want SO_BINDTODEVICE, which we have.
