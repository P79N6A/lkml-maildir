anyone tried using the cypress_m8 usb serial cable on a G5 ?  just
tried it on a ppc64/2.6.19.1 kernel and all i get back is garbage when
hooked up to serial console of a board running at 57600 baud
plugged the same cable into my x86 machine and it works OK there
Bus 001 Device 010: ID 04b4:5500 Cypress Semiconductor Corp. HID->COM
RS232 Adapter
plugged a pl2303 into the ppc64 and that worked fine too
Bus 001 Device 011: ID 067b:2303 Prolific Technology, Inc. PL2303 Serial Port

find attached logs after doing `modprobe cypress_m8 debug=1`
 * setup of /dev/ttyUSB0 to proper serial settings
 * the board running `yes` and spewing "y" over the serial console to my machine
