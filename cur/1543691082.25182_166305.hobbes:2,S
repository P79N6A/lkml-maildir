I reported that I got user reports of breakage... so far, I don't know
more as I only have one mach64 machine that I couldn't test on yet.
At least, iBook1 is broken (M1 chipset) from what Olaf says (in CC
list).
There are a few PPC machines for which atyfb is "critical":
 - PowerBook Wallstreet I (Rage LT-G, that one I can test)
 - PowerBook Wallstreet II (Rage LT-Pro I think)
 - PowerBook 101 (aka Lombard) (Rage LT-Pro)
 - iBook1 (Rage M1)
 - iMac rev A,B and C (not sure which chip, LT-Pro or just 3D Pro)
 - Beige G3 (older XL iirc)
Along with some older "performa" I forgot about (5400 I think).
The current driver works at least well enough to get a console on all
of these. I'm not sure a stable serie should get a new driver if it
has not been properly validated on these. Unfortunately, I don't have
access to all of this HW to test with, so...
Why don't you push it to 2.6 first then backport to 2.4 ? That would
be better imho...
