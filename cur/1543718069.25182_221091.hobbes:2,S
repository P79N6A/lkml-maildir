I'm guessing this patch contains the changes responsible.
As with 2.6.6-mm2 (and before, from a quick grep of
/var/log/messages), the mouse is detected as
  mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
  serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
  input: ImExPS/2 Logitech Wheel Mouse on isa0060/serio1
but moving the wheel causes the pointer to make large jumps toward the
top-right corner.
When I boot with psmouse.proto=imps, it is detected as below and works
as before.
  mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
  serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
  input: ImPS/2 Generic Wheel Mouse on isa0060/serio1
In case it's relevant, the mouse is connected through a KVM switch.
