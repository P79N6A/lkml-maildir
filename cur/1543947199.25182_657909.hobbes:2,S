Hi all,
I have created today's linux-next tree at
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sfr/linux-next.git.
You can see which trees have been included by looking in the Next/Trees
file in the source.  There are also quilt-import.log and merge.log files
in the Next directory.  Between each merge, the tree was built with
allmodconfig for both powerpc and x86_64.
There only one merge problem and no build failures!
We are up to 30 trees, more are welcome (even if they are currently
empty).  I would encourage architecture maintainers, in particular, to
set up a git branch or quilt tree now to avoid the rush after RC3 :-)
I am now including tarballs in
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/sfr/linux-next/.
Status of my local build tests is at
http://kisskb.ellerman.id.au/kisskb/branch/9/.
  The sparc builds have
been mostly disabled while I obtain a working cross compiler.
