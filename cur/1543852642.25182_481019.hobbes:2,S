The following in-tree drivers need changes:
drivers/video/backlight/locomolcd.c
drivers/video/backlight/hp680_bl.c
drivers/video/backlight/corgi_bl.c
I will repost the patch with locomolcd.c and hp680_bl.c included.
The following in-tree (latest linux-2.6 git tree) drivers are desktop/laptop
devices and likely do not want the "dim and power off backlight on
backlight_device_unregister" behavior:
drivers/video/aty/*
drivers/video/riva/fbdev.c
drivers/video/nvidia/nv_backlight.c
drivers/misc/msi-laptop.c
The ACPI drivers being converted to backlight sysfs are very unlikely to
want the "power off backlight on backlight_device_unregister" behavior, so I
have not hunted after backlight sysfs conversions in the linux-acpi-2.6 git
tree.  Still, linux-acpi is cc'ed.
I have CC'ed the relevant people (please forgive me any ommissions) for the
drivers listed above, so they can chime in if their driver should retain the
"dim and power off backlight on backlight_device_unregister" behaviour.
