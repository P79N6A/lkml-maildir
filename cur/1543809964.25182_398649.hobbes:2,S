Have figures for an allmodconfig now - this is a bit more than 1500
modules.
Running modpost alone takes 8,1 seconds without the checks and 8,9
seconds with the checks enabled (output disabled).
Considering that a a make allmodconfig with no updates takes
roughly 33 seconds the added overhead of 0,8 seconds is acceptable.
