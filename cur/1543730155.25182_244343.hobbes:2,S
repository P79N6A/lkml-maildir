Providing your hardware isn't doing the checksums then you can do 
this. Each ethernet packet driver with pass packets up to the 
layer above (netif_rx()). Something like
	skb->protocol = eth_type_trans(...)
	/* Check packet here */
	whack_packet(skb->h.raw skb->len);
	netif_rx(skb);
in the driver. Before the netif_rx you can validly mangle the bits
