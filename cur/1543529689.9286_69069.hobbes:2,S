   * I checked my system found out that it's got on-board AIC-7890.
   * Also found out that another poster reported an exactly same
   * symptom in the mailing list.  Like her, I think I should go back
        o to version 5.1.20.  However, it seems that the redhat-supplied
   * kernel has got 5.1.21 with the tagged-command queueing disabled.
   * And that works.  However, I need tagged-command queueing.
