It would be great if you could send us more details about how to recreate
this deadlock and we will take a look at it.  It would be even better if
you and everybody else who finds bugs in RAIF submit the bug reports to:

We are in the process of porting RAIF to 2.6.19 right now.  Should be done
in early January.  The trick is that we are trying to keep the same source
good for a wide range of kernel versions.  In fact, not too long ago we
even were able to compile it for 2.4.24!
