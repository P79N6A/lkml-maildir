Please note that the changes to the scsi midlayer requires all
upper layers to use the module_init/exit functions. We do 
_not_ explicitly call the layers init funtions anymore.
Adding the module stuff will probaly fix most problems
(asuming module and builtin do not differ). The link
order should make sure everything gets called in order.
