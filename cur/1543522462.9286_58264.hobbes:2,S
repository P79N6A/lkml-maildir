They are.  But since sshd is started with root-privileges (and root usually
has no resource limits) this is almost certainly a bug in sshd not setting
the appropriate resource levels for the user.  Note that you can set some
resource levels in the GCOS field of /etc/passwd, depending on your libc
and login program. Quoting passwd(5) on Debian/Linux:
       ...
       The  comment  field  is  used by various system utilities,
       such as finger(1).  Three additional values may be present
       in the comment field.  They are
            pri= - set initial value of nice
            umask= - set initial value of umask
            ulimit= - set initial value of ulimit
       These  fields  are  separated from each other and from any
       other comment field by a comma.
       ...
Yours,
