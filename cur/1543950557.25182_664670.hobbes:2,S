They aren't.  Which is part of why the way MMC currently assumes that
insert/remove events don't work is a problem.

Sure, but a host can't be well behaved all by itself!
And in any case, I had already made clear I was talking
about _systems_ that behave properly.

I'm talking about generic MMC/SD controllers of the type
that have been around for years ... on systems which won't
use hibernation ("suspend to disk"), but do use real system
sleep states where card detection (by IRQs) works.

Odd that it's very possible on the systems I mentioned.

I don't know what you mean by "detect a removal after
the fact", or why it'd be needed if you detected it
in the first place.

Thing is, I had also pointed out that it wasn't "unsafe"
in the least on many systems.
I'll refresh the patch which improves that mechanism and
updates its description.
