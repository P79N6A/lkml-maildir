James,
I didn't do it, I don't know who did it, but sure we can try and track
them down and line them up outside .....
Point is that this is how the chips were done and they are out there in
numbers. It makes things a *lot* faster to violate the spec in such a
system, yes it sucks, but thats how things are. It wouldn't be the first
time someone violated the PCI spec in their implementation and I am
pretty sure it won't be the last.
Cheers,
Jes
