Richard, I think the question is different. It is not root vs user.
It is the behaviour of linux pwd. It does not go over the directory tree like
solaris pwd and others. It reads '.' and prints it. F.e. sol reads and tries to
resolve symlinks. And bummers.
Try the following:
mkdir -p /tmp/crap/crap1 ; ln -s /tmp/crap /tmp/crap2 ; cd /tmp/crap2/crap1 ;
pwd
on linux it returns /tmp/crap2/crap1
on solaris it returns /tmp/crap/crap1
If permissions on crap are 000 solaris bummersm, linux does not. This is on
debian-potato and sol 2.6 respectively. 
And this is gnu fileutils not linux as such.
In btw1: at least in some slackware (2.?) long ago pwd was working properly if
sol's behaviour is considered proper.
P.S. Harald, excuse me for the hasty answer off the list. I did not think
properly first.
Cheers ;-)
