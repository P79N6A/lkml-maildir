James,
Here's the ibmvscsis SCSI target submitted for inclusion in 2.4.15.
This driver meets a couple of akpm's criteria for worthiness, in that
its actually been shipping for a while in a distro kernel, and (given
the posts when I broke compatibility) is being used.
This version is basically the same as the recent RFC version I sent
out, with a few bug fixes.  It addresses a comment from Anton about
using gratuitously small max_sectors limits, and has a few other
miscellanious fixes.
The only other significant comment generated by the the RFC was from
Christoph, and requested that this work be combined with the sgtg work
that Mike Christie and Tomonori Fujita are working on.  I definitely
will start contributing to that work, and will convert this driver to
their framework when it becomes complete.  I would rather not keep
this driver out of mainline for the amount of time that may take.
This device driver provides the SCSI target side of the "virtual SCSI"
on IBM Power5 systems.  The initiator side has been in mainline for a
while now (drivers/scsi/ibmvscsi/ibmvscsi.c.)  Targets already exist
for AIX and OS/400.
