In the same spirit, computing a CRC32 instead of a SHA1 would probably
be faster as well (faster to compute, and faster to compare the
digests). The increased rate of collision should be negligible.
Also, the upcoming SSE4.2 (Core i7) has a CRC32 instruction. (Support is
already in the kernel: arch/x86/crypto/crc32c-intel.c)
