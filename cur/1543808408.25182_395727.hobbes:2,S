  That must be what I've been hitting in my tests and will check soon.

  I'll have to live with it then.

  That's the problem and I'll have to synchronize for a proper window
for running my tests.
  Is this SMI thing IBM's eyes only stuff or is it documented somewhere?
  Thanks for that valuable info.
