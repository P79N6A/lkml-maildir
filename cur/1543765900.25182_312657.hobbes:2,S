page++;
The page structures are kept in an array, "mem_map" if
CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM is not set or something like
"discontig_node_data[nid].node_mem_map" otherwise (this is true for
the ARM architecture, should be similar on the others). "alloc_pages"
allocates a contiguous range of pages from an array (and doesn't cross
a node boundary).
