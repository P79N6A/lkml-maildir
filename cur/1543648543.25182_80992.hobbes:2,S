What do you mean about having too many hooks ? Eg. prefix handler, you need
to have a hook in the receive of router advertisement to do this. This is
minimum hooks :-). Also, some of the ndisc handlers evaluate to NULL code
for both regular IPv6 code (unless you have configured mobility) as well as
some components of Mobile IPv6. Eg ndisc_mipv6_mn_solicit_ha() evaluates to
NULL on HA and CN, but is a function call on every MN node. So I don't
understand your concern here.
Thanks,

Several comments.
[ipv6_tunnel]
I think this is almost ok.
  1. I believe s/ARPHRD_IPV6_IPV6_TUNNEL/ARPHRD_TUNNEL6/.
  2. Please put outer address to hardware address in dev.
     Note: you need to modify SIOxxx ioctls too not to overrun!
[network_mods etc.]
  1. Too many hooks,
     and many duplicate codes in ipv6 stack and mipv6 stack.
     (prefix handler, header parser, ndisc handler etc...)
more comment will come later...

Well, I can't find them. I hope they'll be available when I wake up
tomorrow...
