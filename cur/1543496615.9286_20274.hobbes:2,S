Hi,
here comes my problem report.
[1.] One line summary of the problem:
Allocation of too much memory hangs system, kernel 2.2.*
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
a) An (erronous) program allocates memory in some kind of endless loop.
   After some while the system hangs. I use the system over an ethernet.
   The system may be ping'ed, but no other action is possible.
   CTRL-ALT_DEL form the direct connected keyboard does not work. Since even
   after 30 minutes, nothing is possible (except ping). Only the power-off
   botton is able to reactivate the system :-)
b) A (correct) program requires a lot of memory, more than available (physical
   and swap) on another Linux box. The program is executed in an xterm
   running under KDE 1.1. After some time I'm logged out (i.e. I get KDE's
   login-screen). On a first view the system seems to work, but sooner
   or later, one detects that modules can't be loaded. Hence the system
   must be rebooted.
Using the "old" 2.0.36 kernel,in both cases the programs were aborted
after some time and the system continues to work without any problems.
Switching off all swap devises  in case a) I get a `Bus error'.
After that the systems continues to work, but I can't accesses the NFS-mounted
file system any more from the other machine. Rebooting the system is required.
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
Virtual memory, allocating more memory than available.
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
Linux version 2.2.9 (root@joergli) (gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314 (egcs-1.1.2 release)) #8 Fri May 14 17:51:29 CEST 1999
This happens also in kernel: 2.2.5, 6, 7, and 2.2.8
[5.] Output of Oops.. message (if applicable) with symbolic information
     resolved (see Documentation/oops-tracing.txt)
-none-
[6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the
     problem (if possible)
-none-

[7.4.] SCSI information (from /proc/scsi/scsi)

[7.5.] Other information that might be relevant to the problem
       (please look in /proc and include all information that you
       think to be relevant):
I have 128 MB main memory and `swapon -s' gives:
Filename                        Type            Size    Used    Priority
/dev/sda5                       partition       136516  0       999
/dev/sdb1                       partition       136516  0       888
(The problem occurs also if I use only one swap device)
[X.] Other notes, patches, fixes, workarounds:
setting `ulimit -v ....' in /etc/profile. But this works obviously only on a
single user system :-).
Do you need more information?
This behaviour can be reproduced and happens always.
With best regards
Juergen Vollmer
