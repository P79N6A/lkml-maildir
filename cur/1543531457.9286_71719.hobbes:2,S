This part should not be in msdos.c.
The current setup of fs/partitions is that check.c has a list
of possible partition table types tried at the outer level
(acorn, msdos, osf, sun, amiga, atari, mac, sgi, ultrix).
So, if you want to detect BSDI at the outer level, you should not
interrupt the msdos code, but add a new item to the list in check.c.
Such a new bsd.c would be very similar to osf.c. If it is not
the same, add it.
But the osf.c stuff looks so similar to the bsd stuff, even the magic
numbers are the same, that I conjecture that you already have what you want,
no patch needed, just enable CONFIG_OSF_PARTITION.
