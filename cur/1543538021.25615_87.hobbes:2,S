I noticed this too on binutils 2.9.1 under ARM - I use several different
sections during the startup of the kernel.  What I noticed was that very
frequently, binutils 2.9.1.0.xx used to get the relocations just plain
and simply *wrong*.  For this reason, ARM didn't support the .text.init
section for a very long time (until recently in fact).
This was easy to spot, since it was very localised, and had the general
effect of leaving you without a bootable kernel.
Since then, I have a makefile which refuses to compile Linux with any version
of binutils older than 2.9.4.  Certainly binutils 2.9.5 seems to always
get the relocations correct.
I'd strongly suggest to Jeff that he tries upgrading to binutils 2.9.5 to
see if this fixes his problem.
If in fact this is the problem, then I think that the same thing should be
done with the x86 makefile - refuse to compile if binutils version < 2.9.4
