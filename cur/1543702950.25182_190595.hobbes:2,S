Humm, IMHO it is better to get it with mixed style as long as the changes that
"break" the style are for the correct style, but this, of course, for purely
unmaintained stuff, like... isicom.c :-) For maintained stuff it becomes a
pain in the ass for the maintainer, that should try to follow CodingStyle, but
as we know, not always do.
