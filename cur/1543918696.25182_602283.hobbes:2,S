I was poking around the PCI bus with setpci/lspci last night and  
tried adjusting the latency from 64 to 32. This didn't make a  
difference. I also changed my core2duo speedstep governor from  
ondemand to performance to prevent the CPUs from changing speed. I  
eventualy saw the same pci_abort message but I might have seen less  
of them.
Is there a way to log every device pci device that throws an  
interrupt? I'm thinking if I could find out which pci device was  
stealing the interrupt that I could disable it or look at the code  
and see what it was doing.
