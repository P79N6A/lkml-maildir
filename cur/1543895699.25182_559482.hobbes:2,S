There is a partial implementation lieing around somewhere, but there
were a number of problems we ran into that were discussed in the
slidedeck.  Basically, if the only program accessing the files
containing forks was the Samba program calling forkdepot library, it
worked fine.  But if there were other programs (or NFS servers) that
were potentially deleting files, moving files around, the things fell
apart fairly quickly.
