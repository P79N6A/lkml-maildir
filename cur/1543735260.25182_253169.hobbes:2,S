Subject: ppc & ppc64 development lists moved
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/9/16/290

The lists.linuxppc.org server which used to house the PPC development 
lists went down a couple weeks ago and hasn't come back. So replacement 
lists have been created at 
http://ozlabs.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/
 
. Hopefully the old subscriber lists can be transferred at some point, 
but in the meantime interested parties should subscribe manually.
Please tell your friends. :)
