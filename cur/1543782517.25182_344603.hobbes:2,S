I'll probably not put that into my tree because I try to avoid generic
patches of other people - i assume it's queued for mainline.
If you want you can include the x86-64 patch with that submission too
(it's fine for me), alternatively I'll submit it later when I do the next 
merge from i386 (that might take some time though) or remember about it 
for some other reason.

Ok. When you don't get around to it I'll eventually.

Ok.  Thanks. Please keep me updated on that.
