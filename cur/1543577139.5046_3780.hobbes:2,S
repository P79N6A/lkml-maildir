Is this specific to the 366?  My DTLAs on a 370 are working like a
charm at udma5.  I haven't run bonnie or DiskPerf on them, but hdparm
shows values that look right (~36MB/s for -t and ~136MB/s for -T).
Box is currently on 2.2.18 + ide-2.2.18-1209, but was also run on
a 2.4.0-test1n (11 IIRC) for a while w/ similar results.
