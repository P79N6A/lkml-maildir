I think you're right.  Now that bdflush calls page_launder with GFP_KERNEL,
the flush_dirty_buffers call isn't needed there.  I think the current
bdflush (with or without the flush_dirty_buffers call) will be more
aggressive at freeing buffer cache pages from the inactive_dirty list, and
it will be interesting to see how it performs.  I think it will be better,
but the blocksize < pagesize case might screw us up.

Only for the buffer cache pages.  For actual file data, flush_dirty_buffers
is calling the writepage func, and we should still be able to cluster it.
