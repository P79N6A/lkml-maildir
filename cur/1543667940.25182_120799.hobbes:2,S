What reason?  I just grepped 2.5.66-bk2, and *noone* uses the return
value, not even to BUG() (you have to grep for all the wrappers for
notifier_call_unregister, too).
That's because everyone realizes that the return value is useless.

(I assume you mean notifier_call_unregister).  Yes, but that's another
battle.
Meanwhile, at least I'm not adding to the problem.
Rusty.
