Thanks for the info.
 From what they say over on lwn.net, I need to apply a patch, but my 
current kernel (debian for amd64) is already trying to call it ioctl32.
Problem is, the kernel headers don't seem to have an entry in the 
file_operations struct for compat_ioctl.  Does anyone know if there's 
any other place (struct) I should be looking to put this function?
I thought it a bit odd that the prebuilt default kernel is trying to 
call this function, but the headers for this kernel don't seem to allow 
me to insert it into the fops struct.
Thanks,
James
