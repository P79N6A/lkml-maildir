Ok, so your KVM fakes the response to POLL command. But normally
(with resync disabled) your mouse works just fine with your KVM,
you can still use wheel after switching between the boxes, right?
If so I will try adjusting my patch.
In the mean time could you please try the tiny patch below - it
shoudl get rid of "unknown logitech mouse" message. Could you send
me your dmesg after applying the patch?
Thanks!
