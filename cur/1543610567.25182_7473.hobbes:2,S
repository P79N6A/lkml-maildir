I keep more (though I really don't need that many) ... and I *do* add text  
to kernel names myself.
So I wrote a (very quick-and-dirty) little Perl script. Maybe a variant of  
that works for other people, too.
Features: label is (hopefully sensibly) shortened image name. Also, a  
number is used as an alias; it's easier to select "1" than some lengthy  
string. Kernels are (hopefully) sorted chronologically (this doesn't work  
if EXTRAVERSION starts with a letter).
WARNING: this makes some assumptions about my system. You need to adapt  
that part.
WARNING: the sort routine only works on a Debian system. If you live on  
something else, adapt the sorter.
The script asks before overwriting your lilo.conf and keeps backups, so  
you have a chance of looking at the result and tweaking the script before  
committing to it.
