What do all the mounts on this system look like?
The changes in fact change the kernel ABI but any programs which has
problems with this is buggy and it either can easily be changed, or it
actively does something compromising the security of the system.
Anyway, stalling is the least I expect since the kernel returns a new
error.  Unless, of course, there is another programming mistake in the
program's code.
