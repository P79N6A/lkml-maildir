I think, it just takes trying things out. From reading the code, I 
think this should work well for the filemap_xip code with no struct page.
Also, we need eliminate nopage() to get rid of the struct page. 
Unfortunately I don't find time to try this out for now, and on 390 we 
can live with struct page for the time being. In contrast to the 
embedded platforms, the mem_mep array gets swapped out to disk by our 
hypervisor.
so long,
Carsten
