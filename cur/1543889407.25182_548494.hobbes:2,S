Btw, this is fundamental. If you don't need to understand the code, then 
the compiler could have just fixed it for you, and there was no need to 
warn.
So compiler warnings have two cases:
 - the compiler is being a complete a**hole, and the warning should exist. 
   It happens.
 - it can be fixed, but only by understanding what the code wants to do.
In no case is it ok to just "shut up the warning".
