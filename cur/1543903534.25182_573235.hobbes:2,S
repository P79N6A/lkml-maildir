The corruption will only occur if the filesystem is dirty. Granted, the
mount will be dead and useless, but I wouldn't call that corruption.
Anyway, this behaviour was selected after seeing the long discussion
about how USB should handle the same problem. It was decided that it
was best to play it safe and remove any devices that couldn't be
determined to have remained in the slot. We also have the USB_PERSIST
option these days, which does the same thing as MMC_UNSAFE_RESUME.

Or that direct usage of /sys/power/state is only for those who know
what they are doing (and have umounted their filesystems beforehand).

I am of the opinion that it was more broken before I touched it. Silent
corruption is never acceptable in my book. But if it is in yours, just
enable MMC_UNSAFE_RESUME and you'll have the old behaviour.
