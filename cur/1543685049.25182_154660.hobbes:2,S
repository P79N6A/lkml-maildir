I'm currently testing busstate ioctl based rescanning in 2.4 (long story involving
a laptop). I've made the busstate off code clean up the device - so the hwif becomes
device->present=0 for all devices and busstate on rescans the bus and updates the
device objects.
Its a hack in many ways to keep the base objects present so that the brown and sticky
issues of blk queues in 2.4 never meet the fan of object destruction.
