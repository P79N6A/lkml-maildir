I think John has changed this, but in the "old" code if ntp was correcting the clock such that less 
than TICK_NSEC was added on a tick, AND, the time was read just prior to this tick the get_offset 
code would return ~TICK_NSEC of offset which would mean that a read right after the tick might be 
less than the one just prior to the tick.  The error, however, would be in the nanosecond area (no 
where near a second).  Again, as I said, I think John has changed this in is code so that the 
get_offset equivalent is also ntp corrected, thus eliminating the small back step.
