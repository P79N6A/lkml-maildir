Matt,
SANE (and probably some other applications) parses the
output of 'cat /proc/scsi/scsi' so any change to its
format may trip SANE up. How about another entry in
the /proc/scsi directory that has a more parsable format
(e.g. xml :-) ).
Also ISA adapters are not the only non-PCI adapters,
there are the growing band of pseudo adapters that
may or may not have a PCI bus at the bottom of some
other protocol stack.
