Just How bad is it for you?  I just tested stat on my crapbox and for
a short path 1M stats takes 0.5s and for a longer path (30 bytes or
so) 2.8s.
Sure, it's always nice to make things faster, but given that whatever
else I'm doing with this information will most likely be *many* times
slower I'm not sure if reducing it to zero would make any appreciable
difference here...
