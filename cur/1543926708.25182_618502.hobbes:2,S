It does, although significantly less so than disks.  Read latency is
typically between 100x and 1000x less than disk latency.
Another argument against this is that free space directly translates to
speed, both for disks and flash.  Disk filesystems fragment like hell if
the disk is constanly near-full and flash filesystems require a lot more
garbage collection overhead.
