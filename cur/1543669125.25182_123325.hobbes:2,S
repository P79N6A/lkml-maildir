Wouldn't it cost almost twice as much when the user requests a different task, instead of the just 
swaped-in "last swaped-out task(s)"?!
Instead of loading this directly into a free portion of phys. memory, the 
just-swapped-in-ex-swapped-out task(s) would need to be swapped-out *again* in favour of the 
to-be-swaped-in task...
Or am I wrong here?
