No, the philosophy should be that we send the ioctl's to the mapped
device and not to the targets underlying that mapped-device.
And doing so, I should be able to access the complete map that belongs
to that mapped device. If I implement an ioctl of my own and try to
serve it, the problem would be that it would never allow me to serve
it if has more than one target.
