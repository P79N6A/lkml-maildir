I have the same processor in my old archive machine with an ancient
2.0.36 kernel.  I do recall the kernel is an i586 and I believe there
was a cyrix CPU option back then (I have to take the drives out of that
machine and put them in this one to check as the system stopped booting
a few days ago).  So looks like a bug.

I responded to this message only to possibly correct this address, I
believe you are looking for davej@redhat.com, correct?
