What block size do you have? If it's 2Kb, then we've got direct blocks
preserved, indirect block - too.

32737 blocks blown away. That is, 63 pointers in double indirect - zeroed,
481 pointer in the 64th indirect - zeroed, 26 pointers - preserved, the
rest - zeroed, size - unchanged. WTF?
The last part (size) looks especially odd - ext2_truncate() would not be
even called before the ->i_size was set.

Some other POS happens with -test7 & mutt...
<thinks> I can see it happening in one scenario: out of space while trying
to do sparse write into mailbox. But this (12+512)*2048 really smells like
fs bug.
I'll try to reproduce this sucker...
