Hi, everyone on LKML:
    I am reading slab implement code (2.6.11.11).
    The function kmalloc() is one of the frequently used funtions in 
kernel , of course,
it is one of my focuses.
    But I found it may call __you_cannot_kmalloc_that_much(). but I can 
not get where is
defined. I tried to search in LXR , Source navigator, and run grep in 
include, mm directory,
but nothing to return.
    What's secret in here? Waitting for any answer.
    Thanks.
                                                             liyu
                                                                  NOW~
