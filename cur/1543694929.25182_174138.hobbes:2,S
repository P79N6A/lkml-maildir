I suspect that you've gotten hold of the wrong end of this stick... I
would assume that you start by stating which pattern is better, then use
the analysis to determine which of the possible actions is most likely
to make the pattern match the target. By pattern I mean response vs.
throughput, and similar tradeoffs.
This assumes:
 - that I understood what the o.p. meant
 - that the past is a useful predictor of the future
In any case, I think this scheduler proposal is interesting, I'd love to
see a working version.
