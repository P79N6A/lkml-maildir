Based on the messages and glancing over the hfs code, I would guess
that the CD-ROM block device driver used to fake accessing the drive
at any random block size. The hfs code depends on being able to use
a particular block size (512) and if the driver for the block device
doesn't support it, stuff breaks.
(super.c lines 394-416/491 byte 10778/12361 87%)
        /* set the device driver to 512-byte blocks */
        set_blocksize(dev, HFS_SECTOR_SIZE);
To be more flexible, the hfs code shouldn't force a hard coded block size.
