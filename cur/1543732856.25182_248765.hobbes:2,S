Even with hardware RAID the numbers I see are not often
much better than this.
Unless O_DIRECT is used (hdparm --direct), in which case they
immediately jump to a level that is more limited by the PCI
and memory speeds of the system.
Eg.  205Mbytes/sec for a 4-drive RAID0 over 64-bit/66Mhz PCI.
I guess the page_cache overhead is rather substantial
for the simple read-a-sequential-block test.
