Especially  in the case where it is unlikely that somebody is deselecting
NET, it makes more sense to depend on it, since IFF somebody deselects NET
(i.e. embedding) he wants to actually see which drivers are still available
(and she does not expect to see stil network drivers which reverse her
selection).
