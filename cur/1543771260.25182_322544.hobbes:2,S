The "quality" or fidelity isn't the issue here, but rather the rip being 
deterministic and producing the same (as as often as possible, correct) 
data. Joerg used the "paranoia" library to do the ripping validation, 
and I'm unconvinced that there is anything better in that regard.
The device names are totally another issue, which I'm not ready to drag 
around the block yet again.
