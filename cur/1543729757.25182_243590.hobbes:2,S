The release/ioctl functions should be no problems to convert, but how
do I prevent pkt_open() and pkt_remove_dev() from racing against each
other with your suggestion? Currently this is handled by the ctl_mutex
and the fact that pkt_find_dev_from_minor() returns NULL if the packet
device has gone away.
