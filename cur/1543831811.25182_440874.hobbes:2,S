OK, but what happened to the 35-bytes-per-callsite saving?
Sorry to keep going on about this, but your numbers seem just too big to
me, and the above confirms that, and I don't know what's happening.
It doesn't seem right that uninlining something like this:
static inline void init_waitqueue_func_entry(wait_queue_t *q,
					wait_queue_func_t func)
{
	q->flags = 0;
	q->private = NULL;
	q->func = func;
}
is going to gain us much code size benefit at all.  Let alone
runtime/codegen benefit.
