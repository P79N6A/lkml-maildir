This usually happens to IRQ 12 and PS/2 style mice.  (If you boot with a card or two plugged in and IRQ 12 is not speciffically excluded.)
I have gotten bit by this one as well.
Another sticky laptop issue is installs on the Libretto.  The PCMCIA issue applies, as well as an oddity that if you need more than one floppy, Linux has problems seeing it.  (The Libretto uses an odd floppy connector that the bios sees, but Linux does not at the point of the second disk in Redhat's install.) I can get you more details on this one if you want.  A friend of mine has Linux installed on one. (And I get to hear him complain every time he upgrades.)
My problems with PCMCIA are more userland related.  (Like the drivers not giving enough time for my external IDE to spin up.  A forced reset fixes the problem, but it is kind of hacky.)
