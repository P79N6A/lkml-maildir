Hello,
the usbnet module from 2.6.5 and 2.6.6-rc1 is not working with my
zaurus. 2.6.3 worked fine.
The log-messages are exactly the same in all three cases:
  usb 2-2: new full speed USB device using address 3
  usb0: register usbnet at usb-0000:00:0c.0-2, Sharp Zaurus SL-5x00
and the usb0 device is configured the same, but with kernel 2.6.3 the
connection works, with 2.6.5 and 2.6.6.-rc1 nothing happens. Trying to
ping the zaurus times out and trying to remove the usbnet module
hangs.
BTW: I'm not subscribed to this list.
