IMNSHO trusted mode or untrusted mode should be filesystem flag: in trusted
mode LOTS of programs should be configured differently. Perhaps mount option
will be enough. It's NOT system-wide issue, rather filesystem-wide (kernel
works in trusted mode even now (modulo things like mtrr not yet converted to
capabilities), just exec part work in non-trusted mode...
