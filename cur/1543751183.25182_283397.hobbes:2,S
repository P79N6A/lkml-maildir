What "plenty of time?" There are changes between the last -bk and the 
next release in some cases, significant change within days of release. I 
can't imagine a vendor chasing -mm between releases, and I bet even 
Andrew couldn't say exactly what will or won't go into a release. He has 
goals, but the patches he gets may not be stable enough to include; he 
wants stability, but things may NEED to be changed in the case of a 
major bug or security issue.
Some changes, like 4k stacks, can be seen coming, and changes for them 
don't prevent things from working the old way. Some have to be one thing 
or the other at the level of drivers and vmware, so they may not be 
available the instant a new release hits the spool.
At least things like vmware *will* be fixed, I expect to run 2.4 on some 
machines indefinitely because the proprietary drivers stop there and I 
can't justify replacing the whole system just to get 2.6.
