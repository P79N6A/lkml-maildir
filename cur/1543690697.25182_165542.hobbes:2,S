The only odd behaviour I see with v15 (and also with v10) is that X 
occasionally terminates when I unlock the screen. Haven't run pure test[45] 
enough to say for sure that it doesn't happen there. Load was setiathome, 
kernel make -j3, calculate PI to 20k places. System was responsive and 
pleasant to use before I locked it, when I came back X died, system was still 
stable.
RH 7.3 base, 2.6.0-test5+nick15, PII-350, 96MB, KDE
Next week I'll run pure test5 for a day and see what happens. I'll also get 
some actual numbers on responsiveness (I think). After stability test I'll 
run test5-mm1 (or latest) and look for the X oddity. So far Nick-v15 seems to 
do a better job than test5-mm1, I don't have a sound card the system will use 
at the moment.
