I might have said 2.1.106 (I'm still running that on one box), but that's
the general sweet spot.

In the 2.4-ac vs. 2.4-aa tests I did in the spring, rmap was better on
small memory, -aa was better with large memory and heavy write load. I
expect ioscheduling to address this, and when I get a totally expendable
large machine I'll try 2.5 again.
