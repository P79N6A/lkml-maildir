I would never call the SMP locking pathetic, but it could be improved.
Looking at Figure 6 (Star-CD, 1-64 processors on Altix) and Figure 7
(Gaussian 1-32 processors on Altix) on page 13 of "Linux Scalability for
Large NUMA Systems", available for download here:
http://archive.linuxsymposium.org/ols2003/Proceedings/
it appears that for those applications, the curves begin to flatten
rather alarmingly.  This may have little to do with locking overhead.
One possible benefit of using ccClusters would be to stay on that lower
part of the curve for the nodes, using  perhaps 16 CPUs in a node.  That
way, a 256 CPU (e.g. Altix 3000) system might perform better than if a
single kernel were to be used.  I say might.  It's likely that only
empirical data will tell the tale for sure.

Thank you for that very succinct summary of my rather long-winded
exposition on that subject which I posted here:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=105214105131450&w=2
Quite a bit of the complexity which I mentioned, if it were necessary at
all, could go into user space helper processes which get spawned for the
kernel going away, and before init for the on-coming kernel. Also, my
comment about not being able to shoe-horn two kernels in at once for
32-bit arches may have been addressed by Ingo's 4G/4G split.
