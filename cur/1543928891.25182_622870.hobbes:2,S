Subject: [patch 0/3] Per cpu relocation to ZERO and x86_32 percpu ops on x86_64
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patchset allows the use of x86_32 percpu ops on x86_64 while maintaining
%gs pointing to the pda. It does that by moving the x86_64 pda into
the percpu area (thereby pointing %gs at the per cpu area) and then
relocating the x86_64 per cpu variables to start at 0.
Patch applies on top of the per cpu cleanup patches V2.
See 
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=119628478316525&w=2
Ultimately I think we can make the per cpu accessors arch independent
(see the RFC at 
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=119552126330405&w=2
).
There is a performance benefit from using these in core code.
