There is no "spec" that states this is a requirement, however, telecom 
customers require the elapsed time from the time they request the disk 
to be used, to the disk being usable by the operating system to be 20 msec.
Its even more helpful for their applications if the call that hotswap 
inserts blocks until the device is actually ready to use and available 
in the filesystem.  Another requirement of any system that attempts to 
replace devfs would be this capability (vs constantly checking for the 
device in the filesystem).
