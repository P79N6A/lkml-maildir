'ls' would never submit a new request before the previous one completes,
such is the nature of sync processes. That's the whole reason we have
the idle window.

No, idling is on a per-cfqq (process) basis. I did not mean to increase
slice_sync, that wont help at all. It's the window between submissions
of requests that I wanted to test being larger, but apparently that
wasn't the case here.
