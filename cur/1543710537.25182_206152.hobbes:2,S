Keith Owens:

Kumar Gala:
  o [PPC32] imported in CPM 8260_io drivers from linuxppc_2_4_devel tree
  o [PPC32] Added support ADS 8272 board
  o [PPC32] Renamed 8260 CPM handling to CPM2.  This is to allow reuse of CPM2 code between PQ2 and PQ3 devices.  8xx is considered CPM1
  o [PPC32] Renamed 8260 CPM handling to CPM2.  This allows reuse of CPM2 code between PQ2 and PQ3 devices.  8xx is considered CPM1
Marcelo Tosatti:
  o Ogawa Hirofumi: fix FAT over NFSv2
  o Change LAN media MAINTAINERS entry to Orphan
  o Changed EXTRAVERSION to -pre3
Patrick McHardy:
  o [PKT_SCHED]: Fix ipv6 ECN marking in RED scheduler
Thomas Winischhofer:
  o sisfb update
Trond Myklebust:
  o A patch to fix an Oops in the locking code
  o Slight optimization to the NFS writes
  o A patch by Greg Banks that increases the supported NLM cookie size. This is needed in order to work correctly with Apple and FreeBSD clients.
  o A patch by Patrice Dumas that ensures that the server index blocks uniquely by using the client address in addition to the value of the NLM cookie field.
  o A patch by Greg Banks to help fix the "VFS: Busy inodes after unmount." problem that occurs if autofs expires the mountpoint while an NFS sillydelete is still pending.
  o I have a feeling the second race case of your test is that you are interrupting the fcntl(F_SETLK) call while it is on the wire. If you do that, then the server may record the lock as taken, but the client will never receive the reply, and so will not know that it must clean up locks...
Wensong Zhang:
  o [IPVS]: Code tidy up
