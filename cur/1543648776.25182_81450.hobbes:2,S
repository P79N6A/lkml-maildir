Oooh, yes!  So 2.6 will be just fine for my smp dsl router...
Seriously, we are getting closer to the day notebooks start shipping with
multi-core processors, and it's not beyond belief that a dsl router would
benefit from this as well.  I.e., super-high processing power, but hardly
any memory/flash required.  Xmeta, listening?  What better geek trophy than
a 4-way notebook.
