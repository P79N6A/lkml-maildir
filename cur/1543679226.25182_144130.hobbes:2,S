I've seen disks that don't spin down when set with a timeout using
hdparm -S, that do spin down when given an hdparm -y command,
(I.E. they spin down immediately).
Does hdparm -y cause your disk to spin down?

Good idea.

Good.

Test whether hdparm -y works - it should spin the disk down
immediately.
