Something like this, I guess:
$ apt-cache show microcode.ctl
Package: microcode.ctl
[...]
Description: Intel IA32 CPU Microcode Utility
 The microcode_ctl utility is a companion to the IA32 microcode driver
 written by Tigran Aivazian <tigran@veritas.com>. The utility has two
 uses:
 .
 a) it decodes and sends new microcode to the kernel driver to be
    uploaded to Intel IA32 family processors. (Pentium Pro, PII,
    Celeron, PIII, Xeon, Pentium 4 etc.)
 b) it signals the kernel driver to release any buffers it may hold
 .
 The microcode update is volatile and needs to be uploaded on each
 system boot i.e. it doesn't re-flash your CPU permanently, reboot and
 it reverts back to the old microcode. The ideal place to load
 microcode is in BIOS, but most vendors never update it!
 .
 To enable microcode update, I need some kernel support, thus I need
 the linux kernel 2.2.18 or later, or 2.4.0 or later.
