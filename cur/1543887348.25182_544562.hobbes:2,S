That's not nice, sending a newbie on a wild goose chase like that.
He doesn't want to write to a file from kernel after all. Reading
FAQs is never bad, of course, but reading that particular one
won't help him at all with this questions.
Lars: Read that at your leisure if you have time. It is quite
educating, though completely irrelevant to your questions.

This is even less nice. You're sending him down the road of
directly programming UART registers, knowing full well (I hope)
that this a Bad Thing. What will you tell him when he comes back
covered in bruises?
Lars: Ignore this advice. You don't want to use in[bwl]/out[bwl]
to directly access serial port hardware for which the kernel has
a working driver already. That way lies pain, as I know from
experience. Read up on the line discipline interface instead, as
described in my previous reply.
