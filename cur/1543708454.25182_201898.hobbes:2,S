I see.  From a security point of view, no.  OMACs need to be updated after
the data is updated to keep integrity checks passing.  IVs need to be updated
before the data is updated or plaintext is leaked. (IV + data + OMAC can be
written to device at once).
I assume then that IVs and OMACs will not be stored in the same read-chunk as
the data then?  Bummer if this is the case.

Yes I see how that would be nasty.  But I've never written for things this
low to the device so you are likly better off without me.
