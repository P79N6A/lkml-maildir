I don't agree. It's definitely not clear to me.... Especially as open
source OF implementations are starting to show up, it makes a lot of
sense to start representing non-enumerable devices (CPUs, legacy
devices, embedded things etc...) in the device-tree and I fail to see
why an x86 OF-based machine would not get the ability to use it in the
same way as powerpc or sparc does in that regard.
