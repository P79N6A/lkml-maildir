Hi Trond,
 thanks for doing that update. Short qquestion: what happened to the
following two patches from the 2.4.23-rc1 set?
02-fix_commit - Patch is not marked "R", but all hunks fail.
06-fix_unlink - still applies (with offset) to 2.4.26
Thanks
Martin
PS: I sent this already directly to you, because the LKML messages seem
to come in very asynchronously since a few days.
