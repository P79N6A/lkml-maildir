=======================================================================
* Welcome to FWIW
Thanks for signing up for this newsletter. I consider it a personal
favor your inviting me into your email box on a regular, if infrequent,
basis to share my thoughts with you.
For my part, I promise not to overload you with emails. Typically, I'll
write FWIW once or twice a week at most. But if the news starts coming
hot and heavy, you may hear from me more often. I also promise to be
controversial when it seems appropriate, interesting as often as possible,
and clear about my opinions. I'll respect your opinions, too, and may
even use FWIW to respond to readers' comments from time to time (see
"Feedback channels," below).
What I'd like to ask from you in return is that you read what I write,
give it careful thought, and let me know when you agree or disagree
strongly with something I say. This whole Internet/Web space is about
communication, relationships, community, and sharing--or it's about
nothing very interesting.
* Why I started FWIW
As you probably know, I write a biweekly column for CNET Builder.com
called Master Builder, where I take on a wide variety of issues that I
find of interest or concern. During the year I wrote that column before
the idea for FWIW emerged, I frequently found myself wanting to write more
than the column could accommodate. Sometimes I had more to say than a
column would allow. Other times, I would have just gotten my column
submitted and breathed a sigh of relief when somebody would get my dander
up and I'd want to give them a good dressing-down. But it was two weeks
before my next column, and so many things happened in between that these
tirades just never materialized.
One day my boss, Greg Stern, said, "Why don't we start an email
newsletter that could be a kind of column-between-columns, so you'd have
more room and scheduling freedom to spout off?" I know a good idea when
I hear one, so I latched onto it and the result is now on your screen.
* Feedback channels
This is a two-way process, so where's your channel for getting your
thoughts in front of me? Actually, you have three ways available to you,
and they are not mutually exclusive:
1. Email me directly
You can always send email to me at dshafer@cnet.com. I read all my email
and respond to as much of it as I have time for. If you're looking for
an email response directly to you, this is your best channel. But be
aware that I seldom have time to answer specific questions about
products or technologies or to offer how-to advice.
2. Email me at FWIW
If you want your email considered for possible inclusion in this
newsletter, send it to fwiw@cnet.com. I'll read those and print excerpts
of the most interesting ones from time to time as part of our dialog.
3. Join Builder Buzz
CNET Builder.com runs an online discussion forum for Web builders called
Builder Buzz (
http://buzz.builder.com/
). I hang out there a good bit,
along with more than 40,000 of my closest friends. Posting a response or
starting a discussion will almost always get you noticed and get
you feedback from some of the best minds in our business. It's
worth checking out whether you want to dialog with me or just find great
content for Web builders, by Web builders.
* How to unsubscribe
If you get tired of hearing my rants and insights, you can always cancel
your subscription to FWIW. Just send email to listserv@dispatch.cnet.com
with the words "unsubscribe fwiw-dispatch" as the first line of the email,
and you will be able to turn me off just as you would an annoying weather
forecaster on television. Not that I'm ever annoying, of course, but all
the same...
You might want to file this issue of FWIW so you'll have access to
how to unsubscribe and how to contact me.
Thanks again for signing up. Let me know what you think.
Dan
