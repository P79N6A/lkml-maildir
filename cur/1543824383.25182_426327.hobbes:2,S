Merging fbdev and DRM is the obvious place to start. Fully
implementing a merge requires solving a number of issues. Here are a
few to get you going...
1) Running the video ROM at boot to reset cards, emu86
2) Sorting out VGA when multiple cards are present
3) Determining where mode setting code is going to live
4) Providing a default driver for video cards that have none
5) Actually merging DRM/fbdev
6) Some way for multiple users to control their video card without being root
None of this is rocket science, patches have been already attempted
for everything on the list. The real challenge is political, not
technical.

A true monolithic design doesn't really work for video hardware. In
the monolithic model all devices in a class present a uniform API. The
better design for GPUs is the exo-kernel model. DRM already uses the
exo-kernel model. With exokernels each driver presents a unique API
and userspace libraries are used to provide a uniform API.
The exo-kernel model works well with software fallbacks. mesa provides
a complete software OpenGL implementation. The device specific user
space library then overlays functions that its hardware can
accelerate.
The current microkernel'ish design of the 2D Xserver causes a great
deal of conflict with existing Linux subsystems. Given that 3D is
already in the exo-kernel model, I don't see much benefit is pursuing
a microkernel 2D solution.

There is no technical reason requiring X to run as root, it is a
matter of choice and convenience. I have had versions of X with 3D
support running without root on my local machine but the patches were
not merged.

The strategy of adding acceleration feature to the framebuffer drivers
causes conflict with X and DRM drivers. The better solution is to
collect all acceleration support into a single driver. The DRM
acceleration code is much more advanced than the fbdev code.

DRM already supports DMA to/from the GPU and does security checks on
the parameters. It also security checks the commands being fed to the
GPU to keep Direct Rendering applications from causing mischief.
