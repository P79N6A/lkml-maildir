99:1 may be too small a ratio. 
A read_mostly marked variable should be changed rarely (meaning is 
is extremely unlikely that his is going to change) but read frequently.
F.e. configuration data for timer operations, number of possible 
processors and stuff like that.
If we would make the operation to write to the read_mostly section more 
expensive (by f.e. replicating the data per node) then this would hold off 
the uses that are changing too frequently.
