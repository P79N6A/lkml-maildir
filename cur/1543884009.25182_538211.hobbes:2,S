I still find the leading-operator style much more readable. The most
important thing in reading a long, complex conditional is
understanding the structure of the operators, not the operands.
Putting the operators at the front of the line emphasizes that
structure, especially since you can line the operators up to match the
logical indenting, whereas the trailing-operator style leaves the
operators scattered and hard to assemble into a logical structure.
However, there's a lot of difference of opinion on this (perhaps
rooted in differences in cognition and reading behavior). For me it's
not even close - expressions broken so the operators are at the head
of the line snap into focus and those with operators at the ends of
the lines look like undifferentiated goo. Since some of the style
guides I've seen do it the other way, I assume some people have the
opposite perception. I guess that's why indent offers options for
doing it either way...
