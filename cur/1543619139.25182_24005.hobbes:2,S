Doing it in the low-level filesystem would match how we now do it inside
generic_file_write() - ie the locking is done by the low-level filesystem,
but most low-level filesystems choose to use a generic helper function.
And I think your patch is slightly wrong:

That should really be:
	file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_mapping->host->i_sem
to get the hosted filesystem case right (ie coda).
