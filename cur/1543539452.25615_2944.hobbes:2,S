I can assure you he isn't the first person to discover a way to physically
destroy a disk via software.  It's not hard.... I can think of 3 or 4 ways
to do it right off the top of my head.
The way I figure it, Andre is the expert on this topic.  If he says that
his driver is allowing a violation of the spec which has some nasty
consequences, then we should listen to him.
I just wish I could help test his patch... but I don't have any machines
available for testing that... everything is allready allocated to other
products (or production environments).
