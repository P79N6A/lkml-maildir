This is caused by some problem in the router round-robin code in
net/ipv6/route.c:rt6_select()
Somehow it NULLs out fn->leaf, and then fib6_add_1() crashes
dererencing that NULL pointer as is seen in the report.
Deleting the router round-robin list mangling code in rt6_select()
makes the crash go away, but such a change causes regressions in the
ipv6 conformance tests.
Thomas Graf discovered this bug some time ago, but we still
haven't come up with a fix suitable for upstream :-/
This bug has been there for a very long time and is not a regression
of 2.6.21
I'll see if I can come up with something to fix this properly.
