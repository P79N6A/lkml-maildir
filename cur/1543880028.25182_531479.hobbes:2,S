Actually, I wasn't comparing with other out of tree schedulers (but it
is good to know mine is among the smaller ones). I was comparing with
the mainline scheduler, which also has the dual arrays.

Fairness has always been my first priority, and I consider it a bug
if it is possible for any process to get more CPU time than a CPU hog
over the long term. Or over another task doing the same thing, for
that matter.

I don't see how that has anything to do with dual arrays. If you put
a new child at the back of the queue, then your various interactive
shell commands that typically do a lot of dependant forking get slowed
right down behind your compile job. If you give a new child its own
timeslice irrespective of the parent, then you have things like 'make'
(which doesn't use a lot of CPU time) spawning off lots of high
priority children.
You need to do _something_ (Ingo's does). I don't see why this would
be tied with a dual array. FWIW, mine doesn't do anything on exit()
like most others, but it may need more tuning in this area.

Well I wasn't really asking you to review it. As I said, everyone
has their own idea of what a good design does, and review can't really
distinguish between the better of two reasonable designs.
A fair evaluation of the alternatives seems like a good idea though.
Nobody is actually against this, are they?

I agree starvation or unfairness is unacceptable for a new scheduler.

O(logN) vs O(1) is technical grounds.
But yeah, see my earlier comment: simplicity would be a factor too.
