Oops. I forgot to do a bk -r co -q after the push. Will send out a newer
patch. Also I discovered a few missed files with the handle_sysrq change.
New patch in the works.
P.S
   To the people with the devfs issues. Please send me a log of what
exactly happened and a detail ksymoop if you can. I just tried it on my
system with devfs enabled and it works for me.
