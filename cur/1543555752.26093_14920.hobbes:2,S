   You are not alone. And the problem gets even worse when you 
have to deal with ISDN devices. In my company´s data room we 
have all Linux servers running 365 days a year (minus upgrade 
time) and in one corner a lonely Windows NT Server 3.0 with 5 
Client Access Licenses working as a RAS server for 2 Diva Server 
BRI cards (4 analog/digital channels) plus one analog modem. 
Time to set it up? Half an hour counting NT installation. Time i lost 
investigating and trying different configurations, dealing with 
contradictory documentation, chat scripts, different ipppd versions, 
and authentication failures? 2 days. At Ieast i cant complain about 
pppd oops, as you do, the pppd in RH6.2 seemed solid. The 
document of reference that seemed more interesting to me at the 
time was 
http://www.swcp.com/~jgentry/pers.html
  , have a look 
please.
Regards,
Pedro
