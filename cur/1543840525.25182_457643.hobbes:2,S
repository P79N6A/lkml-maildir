It _is_ too big.  However, I think doing 24 different architectures
separately would probably be a major pain, and never get done.  It would
also have to create some temporary Kconfig names (or give up the names
it uses now, which duplicate some arch code).
How about this: I'll split it up, one patch for each of the difficult
architectures: parisc, mips, sparc64, ia64, one patch for the 4k-only
page architectures, and we'll look at what's left?
