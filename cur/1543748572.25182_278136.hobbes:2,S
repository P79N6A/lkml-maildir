If this is the code then on any modern CPU this is a delay on the order
of 2000 cycles - 2-3 usecs on your CPUs. The overhead of kernel entries
plus tracing is likely larger than this, so the window for the timing
race to occur ought to be pretty large.
this also means that the elapsed time of the CPU loop will be quite
variable, it will largely depend on the level and type of
tracing/debugging activated in the kernel. This could perhaps explain
the observed weirdnesses of the 'elapsed time' metric.

(5 for 5 means no missed latencies by the kernel tracer so far?)
