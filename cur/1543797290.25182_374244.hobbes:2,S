I would say your code belongs in the ACPI subtree. At most the core code
wants to have the generic supporting functions for 'do a taskfile' and
if need be to call an arch/platform resume function that any pm system
can sensibly use.
SCSI should not know detail about ACPI, APM or anything of that nature.
