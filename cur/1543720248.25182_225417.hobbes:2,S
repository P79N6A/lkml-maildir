Why the hell does glibc do that totally useless optimization?
It's a classic "optimize for benchmarks" thing - evil. I don't see any
real app caring, and clearly apps _do_ fail when you get it wrong, as
shown by Russell.
And it's really easy to get it wrong. You can't just invalidate the cache
when you see a "clone()" - you have to make sure that you never ever cache
it ever after either.
Uli, if Arjan is right, then please fix this. It's a buggy and pointless 
optimization. Anybody who optimizes purely for benchmarks should be 
ashamed of themselves.
