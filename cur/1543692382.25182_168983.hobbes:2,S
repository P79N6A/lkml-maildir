Then you should use statfs64()/statvfs64(). Nobody is going to
guarantee to you that the equivalent 32-bit syscalls will hold for
arbitrary disk sizes.

In NFS you need to distinguish between the 'block size' (bsize) and
the 'fragment size' (frsize). The former is defined as the "optimal
transfer block size", the latter is the "block size on the underlying
filesystem" according to the manpages.
These are SUS-mandated definitions...
The VFS itself cares little about the blocksize, however programs like
'df' are supposed to use the fragment size as their basic unit when
reporting space usage. Putting arbitrary values in place of the true
fragment size typically leads to rounding errors, and so is not
recommended.
OTOH, bsize is of informational interest to programs that wish to
optimize I/O throughput by grouping their data into appropriately
sized records.
