Hmm... I've been on vacation, so I'm joining the discussion a little
late here, but as hpa and others have said, cramfs is defined to be
little-endian -- we do not want two different versions of the
filesystem.
Send me a patch so big-endian systems byte-swap metadata (and the
equivalent for the mkcramfs/cramfsck programs) and I'd be happy to
help you clean it up and get it into the kernel.
