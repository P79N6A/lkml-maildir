The address space on ia32 is divided into 3 parts: user space (usually 3
gigs), kernel physical memory mapping and kernel virtual mapping (the
epsilon).  Kernel virtual mappings are used for things like mapping PCI
shared memory for device drivers, in addition to fulfilling vremap
requests.  In short: it's needed.

Alas, it might not be well documented.  For 2.3, selecting between 1 and 2
gig support on intel is now a config option, and if it hasn't been
documented yet, it surely will before 2.4.
