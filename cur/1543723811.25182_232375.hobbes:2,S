Sure, no problem.

Could you provide an example of how resources will disappear again?  My patch
was designed so that even if they weren't available, nothing bad would happen.
Furthermore, it rescans for devices when userspace attempts to bind a driver.
Resources would almost certainly be available during that time, and if they
weren't, the entire pcmcia stack would be broken, not just sysfs.  In other
words, it seems that resource handling is a problem for all of pcmcia.

My patch adds new code to ds.c but I don't necessarily see it as a new layer.
Because it has very little interaction with pcmcia and its drivers, I think it
reduces the risk of introducing new bugs.  My goal was not to create a perfect
infrastructure for pcmcia and the driver model.  It was to add minimal support for
a much needed feature while introducing as few potential bugs as possible to a
stable kernel series.  I see 2.7 as the time for rewrites.  With that in mind, I
consider your patches to be a great solution, but I'm worried about changing
internal ds functionality during 2.6.

It was not my intention to create "double work".  I was aware of your effort
in 2.5 but was unable to find any recent patches. (brodo.de was actually down
when I was looking into the issue)  I would really like to work out a common
solution, perhaps with aspects from both of our efforts.  I think that it is
important, however, that we focus on getting working driver model support into
the kernel quickly.  Once that has been achieved, further cleanups could follow.
I appreciate your comments and look forward to any additional suggestions or
alternate viewpoints.
Thanks,
Adam
