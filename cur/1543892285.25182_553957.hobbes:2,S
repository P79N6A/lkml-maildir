    For some reason I haven't looked into, copying the Ubuntu .config
file always results in having "Build the kernel with debug info"
set, which makes the resulting kernel huge.  Ubuntu's distributed
kernel binary certainly doesn't have this stuff built in, so turn it
off in the "Kernel Hacking" menu.
    If you find that your new kernel spews a lot of messages like "PM:
adding device nobus:yourmom", flip "Power Management Debugging" off
under the "Power management" menu also.  I wouldn't do this
preemptively, though -- it turns off other stuff too, and I think
Ubuntu's kernel is patched not to do that (and newer kernels have the
options separated, I think).
    Flipping the option and building a new package is pretty quick --
it doesn't rebuild much.
