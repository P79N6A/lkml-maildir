Sounds like he wants a loadlin that runs from within Linux. Doesn't exist.
It's an ugly problem but it might be doable with a kernel module. Load a
memory image, unmount all drives, then call into the module which acts as
a complicated halt routine which puts the image in the proper place in
memory. Then, rather than halting, it switches back to real mode and jumps
into the new kernel image. 
Has some utility, but probably not enough to make it worth writing.
