Ohh, I see what you are saying now.  Yes, it is up to udev to create the 
device nodes, and the kernel does not know or care about the nodes.  If 
an application wants to find existing nodes it can open it needs to 
query udev or hal.  If it wants to find out what devices the kernel 
exports, it can look in /sys and make its own devnode to access them.

What part of the user/kernel separation don't you understand?  udev is 
user mode code which interfaces with the kernel via sysfs.  Other user 
mode code is free to do that as well, or just use udev.  Either way, the 
only kernel interface involved is sysfs.  The kernel does not know or 
care about udev or what it does,  only sysfs.  The kernel provides 
enumeration through sysfs, and that is all.

Your logic is flawed.  X + Y = Z does NOT mean that X ( linux ) and Y ( 
udev ) are one and the same even if Z ( a usable GNU/Linux system with 
hotplug support ) is desirable.  The kernel provides sysfs as it's 
interface, and udev and hal provide higher level interfaces.  In much 
the same way, the kernel frame buffer driver provides one interface, and 
Xorg provides higher level interface built on top of the kernel 
interface.  By no stretch of the imagination is Xorg the kernel 
interface to the video card, which is what you are arguing.
