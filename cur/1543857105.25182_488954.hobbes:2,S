SCSI works as a module and it uses sysfs.
See drivers/scsi/scsi_sysfs.c.
Does that answer your question?  I wasn't quite sure what
the question was.
Next question, based on:
drivers/built-in.o: In function `probe_edid':
(.text.probe_edid+0x42): undefined reference to `fb_edid_to_monspecs'
Should backlight and/or display support depend on
CONFIG_FB?  Right now they don't, so the above can happen...
