I can't "hear" the difference between normal and emergency shutdown, and 
information I found does not suggest they are recorded amongst s.m.a.r.t 
attributes. Power_Cycle_Count, Load_Cycle_Count and 
Power-Off_Retract_Count seem to be in sync, although common sense would 
suggests that the last one should possibly not increment on a clean 
shutdown. I will experiment a bit when I find some spare time.
