No.  See

which leaves it undefined.

says implementations have to allow setting O_NONBLOCK even if they
ignore it.
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/9911.3/0530.html
claims other Unixes and NT implement it.
There's a thread that discusses this in a bit of detail, and
suggests that older Solaris might implement it:

Googling for O_NONBLOCK disk seems to be good.  I'd google more
but my baby is calling :-)
