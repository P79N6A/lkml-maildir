True enough; I guess what I meant is you can design it so that it is *no 
less unreliable than the underlying firmware*.

Right.  My point was that you want to treat the transition as modal -- 
you have "boot mode" and you have "runtime".  My work was to build a 
Linux kernel derivative which could run in "boot mode" and therefore not 
require drivers.  The intent was that this "boot mode" kernel would then 
load the real "runtime" kernel and transition to it.
My comment was mostly that there is a persistent myth that you can't use 
the x86 firmware from protected mode.  You can't, directly, but you can 
get the functionality through other means.  This is hardly a new 
technique; in fact, it's very similar to the DOS extenders of old times; 
in fact, it's somewhat simpler.
