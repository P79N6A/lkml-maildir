When did you ask for that? Perhaps I missed it.
The modularity is part of the basis of the redesign, so I couldn't easily 
remove that. Removing the compression and encryption support is trivial 
though (one file each, plus Makefile & Kconfig entries - no other 
modifications needed). Userspace splash - well, just don't compile and 
install that userspace component - suspend2 will keep working quite happily 
without any userspace app to do a nice display (it will still do printks, so 
you won't be flying completely blind).
As for the freezer, Rafael doesn't need to persuade me at all. I just need to 
find the time to do what he requested.
Regards,
Nigel
