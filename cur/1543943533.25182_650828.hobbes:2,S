In common practice, the changelog does not start before the _last_ From:
line (rather than the initial From: line).
	ephemera
	From: author
	changelog
	tags
	changelog, continued
	tags
	---
	ephemera, diffstat
	diff
	ephemera
There may be a Date: somewhere before the changelog as well.  The first
line of the changelog is the one to appear in shortlogs.  It may be
preceded by Subject:.
