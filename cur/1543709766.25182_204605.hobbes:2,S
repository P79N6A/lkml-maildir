Hi all
I'm experiencing something weird, I use distcc over a couple of boxes using 
fedora, both of them crash every once in a while if compiling something 
remotelly. But it seems to happen only when the sender is my box running 
2.6.4-rc1-mm1 kernel, not tried other 2.6 kernels, but with 2.4.25 nothing 
bad happened.
The fedora kernel version is 2.4.22-1.2149.nptl.
I know this is not the correct list to ask problems about fedora, but maybe 
someone knows what can be happening, and what can I do to trace the problem 
down. Should I try to install a vanilla kernel to see if that corrects the 
problem ?
Max
