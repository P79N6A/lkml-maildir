shared is expected to work like in linux 2.4 (and apparently solaris),
which means _physical_ pages mapped in more than one task.

what's horrid? would you add a O(log(N)) slowdown in the fast paths to
provide the stat in O(1)? I much prefer an O(N) loop in the stats as far
as it catches signals and reschedules as soon as need_resched is set.
if you can suggest a not-horrid approach to avoid breaking binary
compatibility to 2.4 you're welcome ;)

that's certainly much better than what we have right now, it's much
closer to the old semantics, but I'm not sure if it's enough to be
compliant with the other OS (including 2.4). I will ask. 
I also guess the app will stop breaking since rss - shared will not wrap
anymore.

It'd be fine for me, but I'm no the one how's having troubles.

the only reason to add statm_phys_shared was to keep ps xav fast, if you
don't slowdown pa xav you can add another field at the end of statm.
Ideally shared should have been set to 0 and it should have been moved
to statm_phys_shared. It's slow but not so horrid thanks to the mapcount
which makes it really strightforward (it's just a vma + pgtable walk,
the only tricky bit is the signal catch and need_resched).
