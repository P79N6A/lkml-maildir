I sent this to Olaf last week, but after reading some other posts I get
the feeling that he is too busy for NFS.

Hi,
	I'm guessing you get asked this alot, but I can't find any offical
notice regarding it. The 2.2 kernel changelog says you should use
2.2beta40 of NFS, but that is located in a dir called dontuse. It's my
understanding that you maintain it? Someone asked on the linux-kernel list
and the question went unanswered. If you want I'll ask there again and see
if I get a response from someone else.
Basically we are having a problem with NFS on several of our machines that
are running 2.2.1-ac5 kernels and a mix of SMP and UP.
The simple warning is: 
Feb 12 18:22:41 thelia kernel: nfs warning: mount version older than
kernel
The problem is when nfs takes the cpu load up to 12.0 or higher.
The message that is displayed is:
Feb 12 17:56:50 hurricane kernel: nfs: task 51686 can't get a request slot
Feb 12 17:56:51 hurricane kernel: nfs: task 51688 can't get a request slot
Feb 12 17:56:52 hurricane kernel: nfs: task 51685 can't get a request slot
Feb 12 17:56:53 hurricane kernel: nfs: task 51687 can't get a request slot
Feb 12 17:56:54 hurricane kernel: nfs: task 51691 can't get a request slot
Feb 12 17:56:58 hurricane kernel: nfs: task 51690 can't get a request slot
Feb 12 17:57:02 hurricane kernel: nfs: task 51686 can't get a request slot
Feb 12 17:57:03 hurricane kernel: nfs: task 51688 can't get a request slot
Feb 12 17:57:04 hurricane kernel: nfs: task 51685 can't get a request slot
Feb 12 17:57:05 hurricane kernel: nfs: task 51687 can't get a request slot
These repeat constantly and NFS is basically unusable.
Could you give me some suggestions on things to try and possibly answer
the question everyone wants to know which is about the dontuse?
thanks
