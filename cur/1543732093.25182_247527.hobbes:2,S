That cache should disappear as soon as I need disk
space. I.e. userspace should never see -ENOSPC because of this kind of
caching. This need some kernel support. Ouch and cached file should
atomically go away as soon as main file changes, otherwise I do not
see how multiple processes could cooperate on caching...
chattr +kill-this-file-when-low-on-disk-space patch.bz2...ubz 
would solve first problem. Not sure how to do the second one.
