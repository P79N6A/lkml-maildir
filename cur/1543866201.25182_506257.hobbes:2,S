This bug should not introduce any data corruption.
It causes some read requests to get a failure from the device, which
will cause raid5 to remove the device from the array (Though the data
will still be intact).
On restart a resync will put everything back as it was.
It is quite possible (this happened to me in my testing) for several
devices to get these errors and for several or even all of these
device to get failed.  However even in this case the data is still
intact and "mdadm --assemble --force ..." will put everything back
together.
So there should be no risk of data corruption.
