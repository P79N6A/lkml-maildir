I have been flamed before for "suggesting" things without code to back 
it up.  There have been lots of technical explanations given for why a 
consistent binary-only interface is impractical.  However, the idea has 
been suggested before, and some implementations have been done.  You 
should look into those.
This "suggestion" is sufficiently uninteresting to everyone that your 
suggestion will not be taken.  If you want something like this 
implemented, you're going to have to do it yourself.  That's the beauty 
of Free Software.

If everyone used the vger kernel, they wouldn't have some of these 
problems.  However, due to the way Linux strives to remain lean and 
efficient, it is technically unwise to standardize any driver interface. 
  That is the nature of the beast.  If you want to write an interposing 
layer, please feel free to do so.

Yor suggestion has been listened to.  However, it has become clear that 
kernel maintainers actively dislike this idea.  Pushing it is only going 
to piss them off.
