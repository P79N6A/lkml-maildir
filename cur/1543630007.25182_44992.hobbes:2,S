Unsuccesfully I tried to load cs46xx or cs4232 from sndconfig.
qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqu modprobe error tqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqk
x                                                              x 
x The following error occurred running the modprobe program:   x

> So you can try to modprobe cs46xx or cs4232 for a Cirrus Logic Soundcard - but I suspect that this won't work correctly. Or try to load ac97_codec and ac97 only. Those es1371 soundcards have 2 dsps. ;-) But one should be enough for now.

lspci -n reports a Creative soundcard:
00:0c.0 Class 0401: 1274:1371 (rev 08)
I am cc Thomas Sailer the author of the module.
Thanks for your great comments, Joaco
