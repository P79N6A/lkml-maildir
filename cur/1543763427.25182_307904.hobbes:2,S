hm.  I don't know what that means.

Well it adds clutter, but more significantly the cast defeats typechecking.
If someone was to change NLMSG_DATA() to return something other than
void*, the compiler wouldn't complain.

But spin_lock_bh() in irq context will deadlock if interruptible context is
also doing spin_lock_bh().

Let me rephrase: please comment the code and choose identifiers in a manner
which makes it clearer what's going on.

connector.txt is pitched at about the right level: an in-kernel and
userspace API description.  It's rather unclear with respect to mesage
directions though - whether the callback is invoked after kernel->user
messages, or for user->kernel or what, for example.  Some clarification
there would help.  
But an API description is a different thing from code commentary which
explains the internal design - the latter should be coupled to the code
itself.
