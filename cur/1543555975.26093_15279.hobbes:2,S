No, incorrect. You can have a kernel thread with binfmt == NULL, see
# gdb -q vmlinux /proc/kcore
Core was generated by `auto BOOT_IMAGE=240-test11 ro root=302
BOOT_FILE=/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.0-test11'.
#0  0x0 in ?? ()
(gdb) p ((((2) >> 8) ^ (2)) & (1024 - 1))
$1 = 2
(gdb) p pidhash[2]->comm
$2 = "eventd\000\000\000\000\000\000\000\000\000"
(gdb) p pidhash[2]->binfmt
$3 = (struct linux_binfmt *) 0x0
