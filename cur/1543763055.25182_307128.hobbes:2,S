As a device driver is inside the linux kernel (unless you're writein a
user-mode device driver :-)) you can use the getcycles() macro that's
defined for most architectures.  It provides a snapshot of the
cycle-counter.
Caveats:
	1.  If you're running with power management, the  cycle
	    counter ticks at a  variable rate.
	2.  If you're on a multiprocessor, the cycle counters of
	    different processors need not be synchronised.
