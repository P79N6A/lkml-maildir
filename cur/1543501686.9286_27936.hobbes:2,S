Hi,
how can I increase the number of file descriptors in kernels 2.0.36 and 2.2.x?
in the FAQ I only found "various patches exist" and "this may break select(2)"...
 (I just got a realy ugly breakdown due to 'too many open files' on my server when expiring news and doing various other things...
bye
	Mathias
