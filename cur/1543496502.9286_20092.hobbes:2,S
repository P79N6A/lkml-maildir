I see the problem with BSD stacks in decreasing the low-bound of the RTO.
I agree with Josip that 200msec is an high number. But really I am not too
much worried about the RTO lowbound since the fast-retrans should avoid me
to lose performances even if the rto timeout won't expire very shortly.
My point is that the BSD issue has _nothing_ to do with the low-bound of
the linux-_ato_ (that right now as side effect of the rto-lowbound is
forced to be lowbound to 200msec too).
