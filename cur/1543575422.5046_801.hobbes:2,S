	I'm now investigating the problem. It seems it is related
to XF86_SVGA (3.3.6):
S3VGEReset called from s3v_accel.c line 300
	Hm, what can trigger this reset
	On total lockup I can't activate ikd nor to use sysrq.
I can reproduce the temporary lockups afetr 1 minute of testing and
usually receive the above message. I have a ktrace output (not
sure if I catch the problem in this output) and this strace -r for
the XF86_SVGA program:
     0.001019 brk(0x851a000)            = 0x851a000
     0.009577 gettimeofday({976474616, 24017}, NULL) = 0
     4.865610 write(2, "\tS3VGEReset called from s3v_acce"..., 45) = 45
     0.000410 nanosleep({0, 10000000}, NULL) = 0
     0.012520 nanosleep({0, 10000000}, NULL) = 0
     0.019712 nanosleep({0, 10000000}, NULL) = 0
     0.019997 nanosleep({0, 10000000}, NULL) = 0
	What means 4.8 seconds between gettimeofday() and write() ?
Can this be a problem raised from gettimeofday? I have CONFIG_RTC=y
in all tests.

	So, I'm not sure whether the problem is in XFree or is
hardware/kernel related. IMO, it is not related to the MTRR
support. Any ideas for testing are welcome!
