You want queuing in the host, since for queuing to make a performance
difference it needs to be propagated all the way down to the device. But
you can't get queuing at the host level if the guest device doesn't
allow it, you'd be serializing anyway. Well for writes you can, but not
synchronous requests.
Basically allow as much to be sent to the host as possible.

I completely agree with your prioritized list.
