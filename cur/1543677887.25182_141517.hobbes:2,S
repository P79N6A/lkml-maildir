Hi David.
I see no clean way to share the rules between the architectures,
at least not without doing something very special for this.
The second best alternative is to have the same implementation
in all architectures supporting this, so my vote goes for the
gate name.
PS. One day I hope to find a better solution for the gross ld_flags hack..
