C also requires a (very minimal) runtime. And I don't see how having a 
runtime disqualifies a language from being usable in a kernel; the 
runtime is just one more library, either supplied by the compiler or by 
the kernel.

Object orientation in C leaves much to be desired; see the huge number 
of void pointers and container_of()s in the kernel.
