Richard,
Thinkpad-acpi LED support needs this patch...
Code using this feature is available for a quick peek at:
http://repo.or.cz/w/linux-2.6/linux-acpi-2.6/ibm-acpi-2.6.git?a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/devel
and I'd like to submit for merging during 2.6.26's merge window (which means
it needs to go to acpi-test soon).
I need your opinion on the patch, and to know where you will accept it for
2.6.26 or not, in order to plan my submission path for the stuff that
depends on it.
It applies cleanly on top of your for-mm branch.
