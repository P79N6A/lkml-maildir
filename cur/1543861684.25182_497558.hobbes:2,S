That is all that turns up (I stripped out the iptables messages that was
not relevant to the driver) at the end of the dmesg output. I have
checked the driver against the lspci output, the driver has the correct
PCI ID's in there, so this driver *should* work. In the past, it *has*
worked, but that was on a older kernel (2.6.8 or thereabouts).
If there are patches or tweaks to the driver, I am willing and able to
test them.
