...in fact even for files that trigger immediate writeout, the behaviour
was erratic, since writes could still be cached after the
memory-triggered flush was completed.
So I repeat: There has *never* been a standard other than the
close-to-open.
There has *never* existed any reliable mtime/ctime while the client was
caching writes.
If you want that sort of behaviour, the options are O_SYNC, fsync(),
close(), or "mount -osync". There is no call for it in async writes.
