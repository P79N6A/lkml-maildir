> 1) Linux ( Compiled with gcc 3.2.2) :  The memory size of process grows when files are mapped during first iteration of while loop. But there in no change in size after unmapping the file. However My expectations was drop in size of memory after munmap( ). On more point of interest  is  there is no
growth in memory after subsequent iterations of while loop.
Assuming you are talking about x86, gcc322 has produced the crappiest kernel code ever encountered. Even simple userspace apps got broen by it.
Suggest to change compilers to gcc295 or gcc323+ or gcc331+.
