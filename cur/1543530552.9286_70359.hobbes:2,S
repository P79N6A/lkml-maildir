Also the TX thread does not seem to properly lock against interrupts
on UP (on SMP it does though). 
Interesting is that it does RX hardware checksumming, unfortunately
in a ugly way (a complete IP/UDP/TCP protocol parser in the driver).
Unfortunately the checksum checking routine is rather bogus 
(does NT do it in this weird way?). Instead of just passing the
raw checksum for the data part up with CHECKSUM_HW, they do the
complete verify including pseudo header and adjust that then
for the raw checksum the upper layers expect.
