Oh alright. BTW, this one's not for your big boxes yet! It does funny
things with timeslices. But they will be (pending free time) made much
more dynamic, so it should _hopefully_ context switch even less than
the normal scheduler in a compute intensive load.
OK. timeslices: they are now dynamic. Full priority tasks will get
100ms, minimum priority tasks 10ms (this is what needs fixing, but
should be OK to test "interactiveness")
interactivity estimator is gone: grep -i interactiv sched.c | wc -l
gives 0.
priorities are much the same, although processes are supposed to be
able to change priority much more quickly.
backboost is back. that is what (hopefully) prevents X from starving
due to the quickly changing priorities thing.
