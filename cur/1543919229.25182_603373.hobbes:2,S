Hi Zachary,
One of my friends' vmware "hangs" on booting Linux 2.6.23, and then get
it to work by applying your patch at 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/4/72.
It would be nice to see your fix going into mainline :-)
Thank you,
Fengguang

PS. the original patch:
VT is very picky about when it can enter execution.
Get all segments setup and get LDT and TR into valid state to allow
VT execution under VMware and KVM (untested).
This makes the boot decompression run under VT, which makes it several
orders of magnitude faster on 64-bit Intel hardware.
Before, I was seeing times up to a minute or more to decompress a 1.3MB kernel
on a very fast box.
