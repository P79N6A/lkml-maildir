	Correct. You are still sending all the packets *to* the same place.

	Yes, of course. Why would the kernel send traffic to a destination out an
interface that doesn't go to that destination?
	Suppose you have two interfaces, 1.2.3.4/8 and 10.2.3.4/8, if you are
sending a packet *to* 1.2.4.5, it will go out the first interface. This
applies whether the source address is 1.2.3.4 or 10.2.3.4.
	By default, the kernel routes traffic based on where it is going, not which
interface address it came from.
	DS
