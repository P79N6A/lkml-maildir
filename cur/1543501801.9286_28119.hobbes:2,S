For reference, here's the details of what it uses on a 1440k floppy:
 Q> Boot block:		1 sector
 Q> FAT size:		2 sectors each
 Q> Root directory:	3 sectors, giving 48 entries
 Q> Data area:		359 clusters of 4k each, totalling 1436k
This results in the first 4k of the disk being the ONLY overhead
thereon, and the remainder of the disk being the 1436k data area for
users to put files on. As comparison, here's the figures for the other
cluster sizes of relevance on a 1440k diskette with 2 FAT's:
 Q> Sectors/Cluster:	1	2	4	8	16	32
 Q> FAT Entries:	2860	1434	718	359	179	89
 Q> Boot block:		1	1	1	1	1	1
 Q> FAT #1:		9	5	3	2	1	1
 Q> FAT #2:		9	5	3	2	1	1
 Q> Root Directory:	1	1	1	3	13	29
 Q> Data Capacity:	1430k	1434k	1436k	1436k	1432k	1424k
Now, the figures with 1 FAT:
 Q> Sectors/Cluster:	1	2	4	8	16	32
 Q> FAT Entries:	2868	1434	718	359	179	89
 Q> Boot block:		1	1	1	1	1	1
 Q> FAT:		9	5	3	2	1	1
 Q> Root Directory:	2	2	4	5	14	30
 Q> Data Capacity:	1434k	1436k	1436k	1436k	1432k	1424k
As can be clearly seen, only the capacities for 1 or 2 sectors per
cluster changes, and in both cases, the optimum capacity remains at
1436k per diskette, so there's no advantage in moving to just 1 FAT.
There's certainly no advantage in moving to more than 2 FAT's either.

That's true in general, but there are occasions where it's needed.
However, one way to minimise the assembly requirements might be to
have the C code create the disk image in memory, with the boot sector,
both FAT's, the root directory and the data area, then call a routine
that switches to real mode, writes the data out to the first floppy,
and reboots if that option is called.

If you analyse the diskettes that could be available, you'll soon see
that such isn't a problem. Here's my quick analysis...
 1. Irrespective of their other dimensions, ALL standard 3.5" and
    5.25" floppy formats involve the use of a multiple of 8 tracks
    (either 40 or 80 tracks occur, both being multiples of 8), so
    ANY format, irrespective of sector size, sectors per track or
    anything like that, will also result in the total number of
    sectors on the disk being a multiple of 8.
 2. FAT mandates the use of 512 byte sectors, grouped in clusters
    that occupy a number of sectors that is an exact power of 2.
    The valid values are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 sectors
    per cluster.
The direct implication of that combination is that ANY formatting
scheme that is FAT compatible, and involves not more than 8 sectors
per cluster, will require that the overhead space at the beginning of
the disk, plus any unused space at the end of the disk, total an exact
number of clusters.
In the case of the format mentioned above, that overhead space
occupies exactly ONE cluster, which is the minimum it can occupy, and 
ALL of it is used - there are no unused sectors on the disk at all. As
a result, the ONLY difference resulting from decreasing the number of
FAT's is to increase either the size of the root directory (and thus
the number of entries it can hold), or increase the amount of unused
space on the disk, and neither benefits the intended application.

I don't know who thought that idea up, but it really stinks! Even if
you included that facility, I'd make sure it was disabled for
precicely the reason mentioned...

One thought: The main objection to the idea of dumpiing to disk has
been in connection with the fact that at the time the dump is needed,
it might not be possible to get reliable details as to where to put it
on the disk. To me, the obvious answer to that is to have the dump
driver hold a local pointer to the relevant location, initialise it at
system boot, and have hooks in the mount and sync routines to ensure
it's still valid.
