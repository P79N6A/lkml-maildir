When tasks change cpu, timestamp correction is attempted, but isn't
perfect (perfection: submit patch to read remote clock - people likely
toast poor submitter's buns very thoroughly).  Timewarps happen, and
even on Intel processors there seems to be very small difference in TSCs
in the same package.  (that's what instrumentation here said must be
true, possible booboos aside)
