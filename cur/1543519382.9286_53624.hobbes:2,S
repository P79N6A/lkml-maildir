Errr, I don't use vmalloc in the zoran driver, I need continuious
physical memory, so __get_free_pages is my friend...
PS. Please don't use the zr36120_mem.c as an example. It su**s.
It taken literaly from bttv.c and much of it isn't used. I have
a patch in the works which cleans this lot up and more :)
