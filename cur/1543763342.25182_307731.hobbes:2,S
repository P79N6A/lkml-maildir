Definitely a good idea.

Further suggestions:
 - Introduce sub menus on separate pages for TCP/IP, DECNet,
   ATM, ... i.e. like it is done for SCTP.
 - Separate things into top categories
     Socket Families (maybe separate page)
       - PF_PACKET
       - PF_UNIX
       - PF_KEY
     Protocols (separate page)
       - TCP/IP networking (separate page)
          - IPv6 (affecting choices below)
             - Privary extensions
          - multicasting
          - routing
             - advanced router
                - policy routing
                   - use nfmark with chaching support
                - multipath routing
                   - cached
                      - rrd
                      - random
                      - ...
             - multicast routing
                - pim v1
                - pim v2
             - verbose route monitoring
          - auto configuration
             - dhcp
             - boop
             - rarp
          - tunneling
             - IPv4
                - IPIP
