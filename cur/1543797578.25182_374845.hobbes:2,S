I was not aware that it worked like that.  My last experience with ISA cards 
was to put a line in the modules.conf that pointed to the base IO and IRQ 
for the card.  There was a serperate file that setup the serial ports.  This 
was way back in RedHat 6.x days.  Thank you for the new information.

Dave's patch is good and I look forward to seeing it in the kernel.
Thanks,
