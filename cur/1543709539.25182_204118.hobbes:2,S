I have Prism 2.5 cards. I run them with hostap driver.
Link quality of 1/92 is very bad. You are on the edge
of losing connection. (At least this is the case for
my hardware).
Let's see how much errors do you have. Do this:
# cat /proc/net/wireless /proc/net/dev
On my system wlan1 has "Link Quality:66/92"
(wlan0 is an AP, has no meaningful Link Quality)

So, wlan1: 907236 rx packets, 3422 retries
(and 309008 packets wasn't for me, wrong MAC, I suppose ;) )
What's your numbers?

Is your orinoco driver is the same for 2.4 and 2.6?
Maybe 2.6 one has a bit lower max retry count or some such?

No oops? No SysRq?
