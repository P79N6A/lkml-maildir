Can't do that. The pieces that go into this (gcc, the Linux kernel, and
minor pieces) are under licences granted by _other_ people, which you can't
just change at your whim. And I doubt it _very_ much indeed Linus or the
FSF will allow you to distribute their respective properties under other
licences than the GPL.
Good luck in any case!
