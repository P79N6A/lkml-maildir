They all forgot to mention one more limitation, the maximum filesystem
size supported by the address_space structure in linux. If you are running
on ia32, then you get stuck with 2^32 filesystem blocks, or 16 Tbytes in
one filesystem because of the way an address space structure is used to
cache the metadata. If you use an Athlon 64 that limitation goes away.
