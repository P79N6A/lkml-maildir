Bullshit.  Numeric prefixes work fine in CML1.
With regards to CML2, hardware and driver filenames quite often begin
with numerals, so it is quite logical that config variables may begin
with a numeral.
You're writing CML2.  Don't create a stupid namespace with stupid
limitations.  I'm glad my filesystem and my sysctl namespace don't have
such limitations.
