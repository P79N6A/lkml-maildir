Only priviledged apps can send these packets. I've never seen it in
practice except for one case that was a bug in the network stack, so
I'd prefer to keep it. The original intention was to give the user
a hint why these packets are not affected by iptables rules, so a
more descriptive message would make sense. I'll queue a patch for
this.
