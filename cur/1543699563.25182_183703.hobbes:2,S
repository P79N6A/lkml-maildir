Subject: [PATCH][2.4] change two annoying messages from framebuffer drivers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
the Linux-on-a-CD system Knoppix has nearly all framebuffer drivers for 
2.4.23 compiled in. Additionally, it surpreesses most kernel messages by 
lowering the kernel log level.
Two framebuffer drivers (clgenfb.c and hgafb.c), however, use KERN_ERR 
to say that their particular card has *not* been found which is very 
annoying.
Especially the clgenfb.c driver simply says on bootup:
 >  Couldn't find PCI device
which can really confuse newbie users.
The appended patch replaces two KERN_ERR with KERN_INFO and additionally 
makes the clgen.c message more descriptive.
Please apply, thanks!
I'll create a separate patch 2.6 later, apparently clgenfb.c has gone there.
CU
Michael.
