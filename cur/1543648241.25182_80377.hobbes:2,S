Yes, we have seen that ext3 is a stack hog in some cases, and I
know there were some fixes in later LVM versions to remove some
huge stack allocations.  Arjan also reported stack problems with
qla2x00, so it is not a surprise that the combination causes
problems.
In 2.5 there is the "4k IRQ stack" patch floating around, which
would avoid these problems.
Cheers, Andreas
