Eeks ... no, wait. You found a (two, actually) bug alright, but fixed
it wrong. When we fail a write, we *must* add it to the corrupted list
and _then_ attempt to retry. So, the "if (++tries <= 5)" applies to
"if (!err) goto retry;" and not to the ubi_scan_add_to_list(). The
difference is quite subtle here ...
The correct fix should actually be as follows: (Artem, this is diffed
on the original vtbl.c)

Fix write_error logic in drivers/mtd/ubi/vtbl.c:create_vtbl(). On a
write failure, we add the corrupted physical eraseblock to the
corrupted list, and then attempt to retry (upto a maximum of 5 times).
Also, fix an oops by pushing kfree(new_seb) below after dereferencing
it for ubi_scan_add_to_list().
