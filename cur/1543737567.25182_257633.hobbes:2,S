Color me confused...
Russell, I thought about not including any symbol which is not of form
"[A-Za-z0-9_]+" in kallsyms, for all archs: you are not the only one
with weird-ass symbols.  Is it that you want these mapping symbols in
/proc/kallsyms but ignored in backtraces, or you don't need them in
kallsyms altogether?
Thanks,
Rusty.
