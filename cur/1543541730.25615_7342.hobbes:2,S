(I know the docs for the sound support say that lkml isn't the perfect
venue, but I'm not sure what is so...)
I have a Dell Inspirion 3000, 166MMX Pentium running RH 6.2 with 2.2.16.  It
has a CS4232(or compatable) sound card which until about a week ago worked
perfectly.  Recently it has been only working sparatically, normally the
module load fails with "init_module: Device or resource busy" both at boot
and when called maually.  I have recompiled it twice, once alone and once
with the rest of the kernel.  When it loads(about every other day), it never
works consistantly, eventually failing with a IRQ/DMQ error(can't reproduce
now, so cannot get the exact error.

ps conf.modules line for the sounds card:
alias sound cs4232
options -k cs4232 io=0x530 irq=5 dma=0 dma2=1
(same config it's had for as long as I've had it)
