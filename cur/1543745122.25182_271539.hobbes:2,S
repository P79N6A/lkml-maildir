I would very much rather not break binary compatibility.  People using
ppp-2.4.2 or ppp-2.4.3 won't be affected by this change, but ppp-2.4.2
was released in January this year and I wouldn't be surprised if
some people are still using ppp-2.4.1 (or even ppp-2.4.0), which would
be affected.
I suggest that as a temporary compromise, we keep PPPIOCDETACH but
make it zero file->private_data without freeing the ppp structure that
it points to.  That will cause a memory leak but will avoid the
possibility of using that memory after it is freed (in the case where
the descriptor has been dup'd and another process is doing a poll on
it).
We should make the kernel whinge loudly when anyone uses PPPIOCDETACH,
too.  If/when 2.7.0 comes along we can remove it.
Paul.
