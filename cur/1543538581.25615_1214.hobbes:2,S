hi,
grepping the kernel source (test3-pre8) for CONFIG_INTEL_RNG, it appears
that there is no support for the i8xx RNG.  is there a driver, and i am just
missing something (rng.h merely contains an #undef)?  if not, is there an
official maintainer?
if the RNG driver and support has yet to be written, and there is no current
author, i would like to code it -- i can cook up the general driver (init
and testing) with a /dev char device and a hook to use the RNG to feed the
/dev/random pool.  i would be interested in being its official maintainer,
too.
please let me know.
