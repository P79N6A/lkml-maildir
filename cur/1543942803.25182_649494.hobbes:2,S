The feature as a whole seems useful, and I don't actually oppose the merge
based on what I see here.  As long as you're really sure that cpusets are
inappropriate (and bear in mind that Paul has a track record of being wrong
on this :)).  But I see a few glitches
- There are two separate and identical implementations of
  cpu_unusable(cpu).  Please do it once, in a header, preferably with C
  function, not macros.
- The Kconfig help is a bit scraggly:
+config CPUISOL_STOPMACHINE
+	bool "Do not halt isolated CPUs with Stop Machine (HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL)"
+	depends on CPUISOL && STOP_MACHINE && EXPERIMENTAL
+	help
+          If this option is enabled kernel will not halt isolated CPUs when Stop Machine
"the kernel"
text is too wide
+          is triggered.
+          Stop Machine is currently only used by the module insertion and removal logic.
+          Please note that at this point this feature is highly experimental and maybe
+          dangerous. It is not known to really brake anything but can potentially 
+          introduce an instability.
s/maybe/may be/
s/brake/break/
Neither this text, nor the changelog nor the code comments tell us what the
potential instability with stopmachine *is*?  Or maybe I missed it.
- Adding new sysfs files without updating Documentation/ABI/ makes Greg
  cry.
- Why is cpu_isolated_map exported to modules?  Just for api consistency,
  it appears?
pre-existing problems:
- isolated_cpu_setup() has an on-stack array of NR_CPUS integers.  This
  will consume 4k of stack on ia64 (at least).  We'll just squeak through
  for a ittle while, but this needs to be fixed.  Just move it into
  __initdata.
- isolated_cpu_setup() expects that the user can provide an up-to-1024
  character kernel boot parameter.  Is this reasonable given cpu command
  line limits, and given that NR_CPUS will surely grow beyond 1024 in the
  future?
