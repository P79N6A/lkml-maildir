Okay, someone just pointed out that the reason for this is a
performance heuristic: the first few hundred PIDs tend to be clogged
with longrunning processes, so the PID space is very dense in that
range.  Thus, skipping over this range is faster than trying to fill
it, and it's not worth worrying about potentially losing 1% of the PID
space.
I buy this argument :)
