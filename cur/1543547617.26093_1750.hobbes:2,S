With DMA from a device -- "snoop and update" still results in only one
owner of the dirty cache-lines: the CPU.  (Even SMP).  But you are right
that it isn't implemented that way.

We're obviously interested in larger packets than 128 bytes.

That's why the data is DMA'd to the card immediately, and that _card_
retains the data at least for the short term.  Long term if it's still
retained and the card runs out of memory, the card DMAs old buffers back
to a kernel skbuff.  This is one way to avoid TLBs.

If you have to do a TLB invalidate then yes of course it's a loss.
That must be avoided :-)

Some people who claim zero-copy is great have done actual measurements
and it does look good for reasonable size packets.  Even though the raw
performance doesn't look that much better, the CPU utilisation does so
you can actually _calculate_ a bit more with your data.
However, I've not seen any evidence that it's a good idea with the
standard unix APIs.  I suspect everyone will agree on that :-)
