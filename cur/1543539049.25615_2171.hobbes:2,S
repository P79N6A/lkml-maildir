Hi all,
I'm trying to build linux-2.2.17-pre12 with the unified IDE patch (I have an
HPT366 chipset IDE controller). When I try and apply the ide.2.2.16.patch
and the ide.2.2.16.20000619.patch I get the errors listed below...
Is this patch not ready for the 2.2.17-pre12 kernel yet? I know that it
applies fine against 2.2.17-pre4
Any help would be appreciated,
Thanks.
