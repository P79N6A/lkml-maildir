Right now every file/inode/etc method in reiser4 is just a trivial
wrapper around a plugin call.  It should instead just set the method
table directly in the plugin initialization.  Example:
static int
reiser4_permission(struct inode *inode /* object */ ,
                   int mask,    /* mode bits to check permissions
                                 * for */
                   struct nameidata *nameidata)
{
	/* reiser4_context creation/destruction removed from here,
	   because permission checks currently don't require this.
           Permission plugin have to create context itself if necessary. */
	assert("nikita-1687", inode != NULL);
	return perm_chk(inode, mask, inode, mask);
}
besides a useless assert we just call into perm_chk, which is a macro
obsfucation to call generic_permission which would be called if
->permission was zero.  A hypothetical reiser4 "plugin" that would need
redefine ->permission would just override it in a set inode_operations.
