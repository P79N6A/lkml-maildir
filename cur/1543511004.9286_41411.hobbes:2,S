Hi
Can you point to a standard that promises anything like what you seem to
want from task switching in Linux? (i.e., so sleep() may sleep for longer
than the length of time you give it; so what?)
If not, it's not surprising that Linux doesn't provide it.  If there's some
reason you think it's relevant, I didn't see you state it.

An adequate bootstrap is a contradiction in terms.
