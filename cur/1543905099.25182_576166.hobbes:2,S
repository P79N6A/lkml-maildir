If you had made the statement before I decided to speak up you would have been 
correct :)
Anyway, I try to always admit when I've made a mistake - its part of my 
philosophy. (There have been times when I haven't done it, but I'm trying to 
make that stop entirely)

After thinking about this you are partially correct. There are those sorts of 
situations where you want the system to use all the memory it can for caches. 
OTOH, if those situations could be described in some sort of simple 
heuristic, then a soft-limit that uses those heuristics to determine when to 
let the cache expand could exploit the benefits of having both a limited and 
unlimited cache. (And, potentially, if the heuristic has allowed a cache to 
expand beyond the limit then, when the heuristic no longer shows the oversize 
cache is no longer necessary it could trigger and automatic reclaim of that 
memory.)
(I'm willing to help write and test code to do this exactly. There is no 
guarantee that I'll be able to help with more than testing - I don't 
understand the parts of the code involved all that well)
