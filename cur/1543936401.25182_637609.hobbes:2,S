It might be a good idea if there was some co-ordination with people
involved in the duplicate include removal work...

I've dropped the "ixp4xx: remove double include" commit and fixed the
resulting breakage of "remove duplicate includes" change to resolve this
problem.

http://ftp.arm.linux.org.uk/pub/linux/arm/kernel/git-cur/arm
:devel.mbox
contains two patches:
"Re: [ARM] remove duplicate includes" from Lucas Woods  
<woodzy@gmail.com>
"Re: [ARM] ixp4xx: remove double include" from Andre Haupt  
<andre@bitwigglers.org>
which between the two of them manage to delete *both* instances of  
#include <linux/reboot.h> in nslu2-power.c
Given that nslu2-power.c calls machine_power_off() and ctrl_alt_del()  
this probably isn't a good thing.
