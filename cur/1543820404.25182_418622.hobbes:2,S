Hi.
I need own ARP resolution call in my module.
Now i'm using neigh_lookup.
It's pretty fast, and works fine if my entry is already in arp_tbl,
but   it doesn't send  any reqest if trere is no one.
I found  arp_solicit function, but it's not exported, and no 
documentation found.
Probably I'm not the first one with such question, but not found any 
sollution yet.
PS Please reply on my priv too.
