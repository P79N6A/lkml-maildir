I dropped maintainance for bcm43xx over a year ago.
So I am not going to catch it up again. b43 works fine.
I don't see a reason to support bcm43xx anymore.
Currently bcm43xx is orphaned, as Larry couldn't support it
anymore due to other issues.

Which testers?
Ray Lee didn't even install the firmware. So it can't work by definition.
That is not my fault.

Ok. So we have to live with an orphaned driver. I am fine with that, too.

So new code is included in the Linux kernel based only on political
considerations instead on technical?
I'm not sure what's the matter. Show me _one_ person for whom
bcm43xx works and b43/legacy does not. And I will immediately stop
removal of that driver and fix b43.

I'm not sure what you are talking about.
If udev renames the device to something stupid (like wlan0_rename)
that is not my fault. That is the fault of a big Linux Distribution
messing udev config up.
Let's summarise it:
I don't know a single user for whom bcm43xx works but b43 does not.
In most cases b43 does work a _lot_ better than bcm43xx.
If you show me one person for whom bcm43xx works but b43 does not I
will stop removal of the driver.
