I had got kernel panic after an hour of aiostress running.
After patching I have not got aiostress massage 
"verify error, file %s offset %Lu contents (offset:bad:good):\n"
during 5 hour aiostress running with 'verify' option.
Looking closely into aiostress.c 
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/mason/utils/aio-stress.c
we can see that this program may write in random mode THE SAME
contents to the same file offset asynchronously from different
buffers and do not cure about it. Does Ken consider that kernel
panic is the best way to prevent data corruption in such kind
of programs?

If invalidate_inode_pages2_range() will return EIOCBRETRY as the patch 
"aio: fix kernel bug when page is temporally busy"
sets then do_sync_read/write() will not drop IO submit but will retry
it:
for (;;) {
	ret = filp->f_op->aio_read(&kiocb, &iov, 1, kiocb.ki_pos);
	if (ret != -EIOCBRETRY)
		break;
	wait_on_retry_sync_kiocb(&kiocb);
	}
And do_sync_read/write() will not return EIO if page is busy
as it does now, before patching.

What do you mean saying 'also'?
