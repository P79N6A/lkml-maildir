Subject: un.h (2.2.5) breaks bind 8.2 compile?

Seems bind 8.2 compile is choking on sa_family_t in
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/un.h:
from un.h kernel 2.2.5:
#ifndef _LINUX_UN_H
#define _LINUX_UN_H
#define UNIX_PATH_MAX   108
struct sockaddr_un {
        sa_family_t sun_family; /* AF_UNIX */
        char sun_path[UNIX_PATH_MAX];   /* pathname */
};
#endif /* _LINUX_UN_H */
I changed "sa_family_t" to "unsigned short" and the bind compile doesn't
choke on sa_family_t anymore, odd thing is this compile doesn't
choke on a Red Hat machine, I run a Slackware 3.6 box. I have tried
to compile on other Slackware 3.6 kernel 2.2.5 boxes, and I get same
error. 
Is sa_family_t a glibc thing?
