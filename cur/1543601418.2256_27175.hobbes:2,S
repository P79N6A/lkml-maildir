Hmmm... I don't think this is possible with XADD based semaphores as they
stand (my version or Andrea's).
With the current XADD based stuff, you can't distinguish between one
writer running and a queue of sleeping locks and one reader running and a
queue of sleeping locks without counting the sleepers

In fact, it's worse than that: you can't tell the difference between two
active readers and a queue of sleepers and one active writer, one failed
read or write attempt as yet unprocessed, and a queue of sleepers

I think it might well be too hard to do unfair reads with the XADD based
stuff. The problem is that you can't compensate for the effect on the counter
of failed attempts to get read or write locks, even when you've got the
semaphore spinlock (the queue length is of no help).
I think that this problem can only be solved by going to the spinlock version,
and maintaining a flag to say what sort of lock is currently active.
