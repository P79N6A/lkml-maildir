I've done a temporary minor hacking, which tells kernel only the half
value of nice in all processes.  Actually idle percentage was lowered,
but the response of the main application became slower (as a matter of
course.)
I'm not sure which is better..if possible I want to take advantages of
each one :)   Am I expecting too much?
