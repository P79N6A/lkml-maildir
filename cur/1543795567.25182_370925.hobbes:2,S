Enable most of the "Kernel Hacking" Debugging options, like
Memory and spinlock debugging. This will often catch memory corruptions
or deadlocks.
I'm not sure where the freeze happens, from your explanations.
Does it freeze before or after the DMA operations? I am sure we find the
reason, if you talk to us about the problem on IRC or the bcm43xx mailing list.
