That would make my kernel builds etc interfere with my other self's
surfing and whatnot.  With it by EUID, when I'm surfing or whatnot, the
X portion of my Joe-User activity pushes the compile portion of root
down in bandwidth utilization automagically, which is exactly the right
thing, because the root me in not as important as the Joe-User me using
the GUI at that time.  If the idea of X disturbing root upsets some,
they can move X to another UID.  Generally, it seems perfect for here.
