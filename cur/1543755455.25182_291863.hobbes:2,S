shared subtrees aside, it is the nature of --bind mounts that they share
all the same dentries; so the "rm -f" above will immediately be
reflected in all copies (with or without subtree sharing) and no mounts
will be possible on the (now absent) path a/b.
I think the question you meant to ask was what would happen if you
mounted something on /tmp/mnt2/a/b (the slave copy) and then mounted
something else on /tmp/mnt1/a/b.  In that case there's two places where
the propagated mount might go:
	1. On top of the dentry a/b in /tmp/mnt2, underneath the
	   preexisting mount.
	2. On top of the root dentry of the thing mounted in
	   /tmp/mnt2/a/b, thus covering the preexisting mount.
Wouldn't option 1 require changing the mnt_parent of the preexisting
mount on /tmp/mnt2/a/b?  That seems like an odd thing to do, so I assume
option 2 is the only possible solution, but perhaps I'm missing
something.
--b.
