Subject: Destination Loose UDP in 2.4 (net/ipv4/netfilter)

What is the status of "dloose udp" in 2.4.x? From my reading in a few list
archives it seems to have been some sort of a hack, yet it is needed for
games such as Asheron's Call to be played behind a firewall.
In 2.2.18 the code implementing this seems to be in net/ipv4/ip_masq.c
and was controlled by a sysctl "ip_masq_udp_dloose".
Is there anything in 2.4.x to replace this functionallity? Is there a way
to replace it with an iptables rule? Any help would be much appreciated.
