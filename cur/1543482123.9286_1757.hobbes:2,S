    Still no responses... (even telling me to go away.)
    2.2.0-pre[1-9] breaks libc-5.4.46 compiles
It is a well-known topic.
Including kernel includes is Evil, a Bad Thing.
Why?
Because we all hope our code will not continue changing
as frequently as the kernel.
Now libc5 does use kernel includes. This means that any
given libc5 version can only work correctly with a certain
range of kernels. If you want to use libc5 then you must
use kernel includes that work together with libc5.
Note that the kernel you actually run may well be different
from the kernel of which you use the include files.
