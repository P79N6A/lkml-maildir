IceWM's monitor. (It just runs all the time, that's how I spotted the
problem).

I don't have procps 3.2 as yet, will compile it soon; however I think
it's the same issue.
I tried the deadline elevator, as suggested by Bill Davidsen down this
thread. It did not help. In fact the performance fell (the same file
took a longer time to copy); the CPU use is still 100% (with an
occasional "dent" or two, but these are very small in duration).
I also tried increasing the read-ahead. It does not help either.
Finally I tried increasing the read-ahead WITH the deadline elevator.
The performance rose (compared to the one measured with the standard
read-ahead and the deadline elevator). And the CPU load still did not
change.
I don't have much CPU to waste (Duron 650 MHz), so I think some
performance problems I see are linked to this.

I've looked at it. I will try the latest rc-mm kernel and report the
results.
