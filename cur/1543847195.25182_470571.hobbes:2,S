This driver fails to check that ioremap() actually succeeded.  Hence with
this patch we can end up doing iounmap(NULL).
Now it _could_ be that the kernel permits iounmap(NULL).  But I don't
recall that being the rule, and from my reading the powerpc 64-bit iounmap
(at least) will go splat if we do this to it.  Most other implementations
will permit iounmap(NULL) by accident.
