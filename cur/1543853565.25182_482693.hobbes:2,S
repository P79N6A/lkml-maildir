Hum.... Are you sure ?
For UP we have this PER_CPU definition :
#define PER_CPU(var, cpu) \
        movl $per_cpu__/**/var, cpu;
You can see 'cpu' is a pure output , not an input value.
So I basically deleted the fist instruction of this sequence :
movl %gs:PDA_cpu, %ebx
movl $per_cpu__cpu_gdt_descr, %ebx;
Did I miss something ?
