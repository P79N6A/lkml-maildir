Ok, so on MIPS my schenario doesn't matter.
I think (but may be mistaken) that ARM _does_ have pure virtual caches 
with a process ID, but people have always ended up flushing them at 
context switch simply because it just causes too much trouble.
Sparc? VIPT too? Davem?
I have absolutely zero clue about s390.
Anyway, it sounds to me like this is too big to decide for 2.6.19 anyway, 
and as far as I can tell this i snot a regression, right? Ie we've always 
had the aliasing issue. Ralf?
But it would be good to have something for the early -rc1 sequence for 
2.6.20, and maybe the MIPS COW D$ patches are it, if it has performance 
advantages on MIPS that can also be translated to other virtual cache 
users..

Castration. That's the best solution. We don't want those people 
procreating.
