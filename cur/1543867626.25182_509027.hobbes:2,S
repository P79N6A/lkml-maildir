One can still perfectly fine and easily use sys_async_exec(...stat()...)
in above scenario. Although I do think that having a web server in
kernel is overkill, having a proper state machine for good async
processing is a must.
Not that I agree, that it should be done on top of syscalls as basic
elements, but it is an initial state.

It is an example of what can be done. If one do not like it - do not use
it. State machine is implemented in sendfile() syscall - and although it
is not a good idea to have async sendfile as is in micro-thread design
(due to network blocking and small per-page reading), it is still a state 
machine, which can be used with syslet state machine (if it could be 
extended).

Well, if we can setup iocb structure, why we can not setup syslet one?
Yes, with syscalls as a state machine elements 99% of users will not use
it (I can only think about proper fadvice()+read()/sendfile() states),
but there is no problem to setup a structure in userspace at all. And if
there is possibility to use it for other things, it is definitely a win.
Actually complex structure setup argument is stupid - everyone forces to 
have timeval structure instead of number of microseconds.
So there is no point in 'complex setup and overhead', but there is
a. limit of the AIO (although my point is not to have huge amount of
	working threads - they were created by people who can not
	program state machines (c) Alan Cox)
b. possibility to implement a state machine (in current form likely will
	not be used except maybe some optional hints for IO tasks like
	fadvice)
c. in all other ways it has all pros and cons of micro-thread design (it
	looks neat and simple, although is utterly broken in some usage
	cases).
