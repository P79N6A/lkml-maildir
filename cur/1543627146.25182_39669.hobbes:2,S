For my boards, I have about a 5 MB RAM disk, at least half of
which is libraries, much of which I know is library routines
which my embedded system never calls.  If I were tight on space,
here is where I would trim.
I don't know if you're doing PowerPC or some other processor,
but nonetheless you might check out 
http://penguinppc.org/embedded/howto/PowerPC-Embedded-HOWTO.html
and especially section 12:
http://penguinppc.org/embedded/howto/library.html
for some pointers to small C libraries.

Subject: Reducing root filesystem
Hi,
  I am porting Linux to an embedded system. Currently my rootfilesystem is
around 2.5 MB (after keeping it to minimal and adding tools like busybox). I
want to furthur reduce it to say maximum of 1.5 MB. 
Please suggest some link/references where I can find the details to optimise
my root filesystem
thanks
Amol
