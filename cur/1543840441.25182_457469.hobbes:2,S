That is indeed the reason why I put this in. In the context of kprobes
code (callback), I don't think it is possible to make some upcall
to userland to interact with the perfmon2 interface. Yet, I think that
combining kprobes with monitoring could be very useful. A simple example
is to use kprobes to control where monitoring starts and stops, e.g.,
on a function boundaries.

Yes. I am just too used to EXPORT_SYMBOL(). I will fix this in the next patch.
