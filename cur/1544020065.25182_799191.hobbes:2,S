Speaking of SCHED_IDLE fixes, is 
6bc912b71b6f33b041cfde93ca3f019cbaa852bc going to be put into the next 
stable 2.6.28 release? Without it on 2.6.28.2, I can still produce 
minutes-long freezes with BOINC or other idle processes.
With the above commit on top of 2.6.28.2 and also 
cce7ade803699463ecc62a065ca522004f7ccb3d, the problem is solved, though 
I assume cce7ad isn't actually required to fix that, and I can test that 
if desired.
