For Win98 format disks, you want the vfat format, so use...

...instead.

I have PCMCIA working with my notebook and the PCMCIA ethernet card
therein, but I'm using RedHat 5.2 rather than Caldera, so it's not
directly the same...

No idea.
Does the SuperDisk plug into a PCMCIA adapter or the parallel port? If
the latter, look under the ParIDE subsystem for it...

Mouse is probably PS/2 so try /dev/psaux for that. Video depends on
what video chipset the thing's equipped with...

Depends what chipset the sound subsystem uses...

No idea...

Is there anybody listed on the Linux Laptops helplist who has used
your model?
Best wishes from Riley.
