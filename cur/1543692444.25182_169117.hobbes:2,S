Please put it in kernel/power/. 
It's completely alright to have three suspend-to-disk implementations. For 
one, porting it does not imply that it will be merged into mainline, as 
is. I would like to see convergence of the competing solutions, and I 
fully intend to leverage the work that you've done and integrate it into 
the core power management code, and the pmdisk implementation. 
The power management core provides, among other things, a framework for 
properly suspending and resuming a system. Persistant state retention is 
one aspect, albeit the largest in terms of importance and sheer size. I 
would like to see backend mechanism for storing state abstracted from the 
snapshotting process. 
This means that there may be several low-level 'drivers' that each deal 
with reading/writing data on a particular format. And, it means that much 
of the overhead of swsusp, etc, can be folded into the core PM code. 
I do not have more technical details about this ATM, but I will work with 
you to make sure things are streamlined as much as possible during and 
after your port.
