The current 2.6.3 driver uses NAPI, and maybe that is related to your troubles.
What exactly is the hardware config (lspci output)?
There are debug messages produced, something like:
	eth0: Tx queue start entry 0  dirty entry 13
do you see these in dmesg output? or change your syslog.conf to capture
debug kernel messages to a different file.
Also, rebuild with RTL8139_DEBUG defined to pick up more info.
Seems like interrupts are getting disabled somehow.
