Hi Macro,

The "LABEL=/" is the attempt to mount root filesystem by label, so you can 
move it to another disk. I find these "clever" things not mature yet and always replace it by an explicit device name (and don't move/replace root disk):
kernel /boot/bzImage-2.6.4 ro root=/dev/hda2
(this assumes that your root fs is on /dev/hda2, change it appropriately to match your situation)
Kind regards
Tigran
