So not only did you spam the list with 40 patch postings,
you sent a second copy of everything as a tarball attachment
as well.  That's even worse.
Please do not abuse the list server in this way, it is a resource
that is not just your's, but rather one which has to be shared
amongst all folks doing kernel development.
