hmm, nmi_watchdog=2 on the kernel boot line gives no
difference to booting without, at least according to
the boot messages ...
ENABLING IO-APIC IRQs

Using local APIC timer interrupts.                                                          
calibrating APIC timer ...                                                                  
..... CPU clock speed is 1533.4487 MHz.                                                     
maybe the nmi_watchdog is always enabled? 
maybe it only fails with nmi_watchdog=1 ?
shouldn't there be a message which says that
the NMI watchdog was enabled?
TIA,
Herbert
