Sounds a lot like a userspace process.  My immediate thought is, why
not use containers, a more natural fit.  But if you have _any_ hope
of booting this kernel on native hardware when it's not running under
a hypervisor then I'd expect the same pv_ops interfaces that allow it
to run on native would allow VMI to build and handle the shadow (since
you'd have taken it out of the kernel).  Heh, so in order to run this on
native we had to add fork/mmap pv ops?  I agree it might be interesting,
but it's still not clear that it's useful w/out some code to back it up,
and see the value.
thanks,
