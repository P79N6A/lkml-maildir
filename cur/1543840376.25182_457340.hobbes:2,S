Applying this doesn't seem to make much sense until it's clear whether a
"build everything except for assembler files at once" approach (that 
needs less globals) or your current "compile only multi-obj at once"

    Gentoo kernels are 42 times more popular than SUSE kernels among
    KLive users  (a service by SUSE contractor Andrea Arcangeli that
    gathers data about kernels from many users worldwide).
       There are three kinds of lies: Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics.
