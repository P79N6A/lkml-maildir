The way this patch was imported in bk-cvs causes a compile-time failure
in fs/nfs/inode.c;
Below is the -what seems to me- obvious fix.
One comment though wrt this code: it seems both the spellings 'flavor' and
'flavour' are used in this piece of code which is somewhat confusing. Should
that be fixed?
