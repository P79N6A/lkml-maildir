Now that's strange.  When you plug the high-speed device into the 
integrated ports, which IRQ counter changes?  Since nothing is using IRQ 
21, it should be disabled and its counter should remain constant.  Does 
this mean the interrupts show up on IRQ 19 (used by ehci-hcd), or do they 
not show up at all (i.e., is the USB connection just being polled)?
Those -71 errors do not indicate IRQ problems -- they indicate low-level 
errors in the USB data signals.  They could be caused by problems in the 
cabling from the motherboard to the ports, problems in the electrical 
terminations, or other things.
