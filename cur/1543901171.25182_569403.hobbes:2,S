The english version of htmldocs is generated from the source code.    If 
translating remotely current versions of htmldocs into other languages was 
feasible, then the english version wouldn't need to be in the source code in 
the first place.
Translating a document _about_ htmldocs boils down to "Dear non-english 
speaker: here's something you can't read, nor can you update it either except 
though your language maintainer."
