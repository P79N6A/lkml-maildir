Good point :-)
What I'd really like to see is a single device which appears as two
logical IDE or SCSI devices, one of which has 512 Mb of battery backed
RAM, and the other one 512 Mb of EEPROM.
No need for expensive flash memory, just cheap DRAM, and a few NiMH
cells to keep the RAM contents intact when the main power was
disconnected.
I've seen loads of solid state devices based on flash memory, but few
that are based on battery backed DRAM :-(.
John.
