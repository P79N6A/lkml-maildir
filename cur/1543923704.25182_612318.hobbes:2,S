Oh, I forgot.
But is there any utility that depends on that uname says mn10300?

I know existing developers should learn the arch name change.
But how many developers?

That's the point. They must always be told or consult the documentations.
Don't you think an arch name should be natural?
People need not to be told on other, at least major, archs.
It's
- growing new developers will have difficulties in understanding arch
name difference,
versus
- fewer people have to learn the arch name change.
I vote the latter now.
