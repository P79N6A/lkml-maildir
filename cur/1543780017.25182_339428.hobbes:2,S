I found it hard to understand your question.
Maybe it helps if I give the basic bug scenario first (pseudo C)
void some_ioctl_func(...)
{
  int count, i;
  struct foo *ptr;
  copy_from_user(&count,...);
  ptr = kmalloc(sizeof(struct foo) * count);
  if (!ptr)
     return -ENOMEM;
  for (i=0; i<count; i++) {
      initialize(ptr+i);
  }
}
if the user picks count such that the multiplication overflows, the
kmalloc will actually *succeed* in getting a chunk between 0 and 128Kb.
The subsequent "fill the array up" will overwrite a LOT of kernel memory
though.
Fixing the hole of course involves checking "count" for too high a
value. Using kcalloc() will check for this same overflow inside kcalloc
and prevent it (eg return NULL) if one of these slips through.
