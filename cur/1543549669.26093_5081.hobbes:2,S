Non-portable to _what_? v2?

I can live with that. Supported by quite a few Unices.

Encapsulate unless you want a major PITA maintaining the code.

Same as with sigaction, even wider support.

_Yes_. It's non-portable within Linux, ferchrissake. And yes,
hardware-related work should be localized.

Can be implemented via rfork(), so that gives *BSD and Plan 9.

And you advocate using it? Wow.

Both are remarkably ugly. Yes, it's one of the cases when you may need
your own functions encapsulating that mess.

And is ugly as hell, as damn next to everything coming from SGI.

I'm yet to see where it is necessary. For all practical purposes can be
emulated by lseek()+read()+lseek() and you'ld better provide such
emulation anyway if you want to have the thing portable.

Bingo. Can be implemented via primitives, though.

Unlikely. GNU userland, as ugly as it is, is less obnoxious than
Missed'em'V one.
