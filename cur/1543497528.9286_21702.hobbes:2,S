If someone purports to maintain an installation tool, then they should
test it.  I still don't know what specific sorts of problems you're
talking about, that crop up only in an installation context.  I don't
know of any, since PCMCIA is generally configured with the same tools
and scripts as in normal use.

That's great.  Unfortunately, things don't work like this in my world.
Maybe I should forward you a couple days' worth of PCMCIA problem
reports so you can get a feel for the sorts of problems I deal with
that don't fit this model.

I've invested a lot of effort in minimizing the need to customize
parameter files for individual machines, since this is responsible for
a large fraction of support issues.  Believe me, every entry in the
HOWTO where I have to document a trick for some oddball laptop is
painful to me.  But over time, the number of such tricks has gone
down, not up.  Much of my effort has been mandated by the lack of
Plug&Play support in the Linux kernel, since most of these parameters
have to do with memory, IO, and interrupt resource tweaking.
I ported the Linux PCMCIA package to BeOS last summer, and guess what,
they generally don't need to tweak special parameter files.  They've
got kernel Plug&Play support.
If you can suggest another way to do this, then I'm all ears.  I think
we would both be better served if you spent a little more time asking
me, rather than telling me, what would make these things easier.  I
think you're being incredibly arrogant.
