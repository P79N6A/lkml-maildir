Well, I'm having a heck of a time getting this to fail.  It looks  
possible, though.  Joe, were you guys able to narrow it down to a  
reproducible test case?  Do you have any oops output messages from  
the crashes?
It looks like it takes a very particular set of circumstances to  
actually crash after relying on an uninitialized map_bh.  (see the  
blkfactor, buffer_new(), and this_chunk_blocks tests in dio_zero_block 
()).

It looks like the unconditional dio_cleanup() and dio_zero_block()  
calls outside the nseg loop are relying on state which might not have  
been built up.  _zero_block() tests map_bh's flags without them being  
set.  _cleanup could, in some crazy world, get confused if we managed  
to get here with a 0 nr_segs because dio->head and ->tail wouldn't be  
initialized.
So we could initialize some more fields at the start of  
direct_io_worker for the benefit of these cleanup calls.  Or we could  
conditionally call them based on some other indicator of progress.   
Neither really thrills me.
And I don't have a test case to verify changes with.  Meh.
How do you feel about initializing the dio with kzalloc() and only  
initializing the fields that we rely on being non-zero, and  
commenting the hell out of it?
