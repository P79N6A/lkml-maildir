But if you read peoples complaints about regression they are nearly
always to do with hardware that used to work not working any more ..
alps touchpads, sound cards, software suspend.. so these people still
gain nothing by you regression testing anything so you still get as
many reports.. the -rc series is meant to provide the testing for the
release so nothing really big gets through (like can't boot from IDE
anymore or something like that)....
