It's not the same thing to test ONE release and test SEVERAL -rc. I take
my case as an example. I don't have enough time to keep up, so I try to
compile at least each release and test them on one of my systems, maybe
for curiosity. I would like to test the -rc, but the problem is that you
don't know how much you can expect this or that -rc to be close to usable.
You even expect it to fail or not build at all, so when you don't have much
time to spend on this, unfortunately, you don't test them.
On the contrary, Marcelo makes a strong difference between -pre and -rc.
And when I see a 2.4-rc, I expect it to be a potential candidate, so I
try to get some time to compile it just in case I would discover an awful
bug, and avoid the 2.6.8 -> 2.6.8.1 situation. Honnestly, I would have
reported the 2.6.8 NFS bug earlier if there had been a true -rc before
it (=one which does not change except for trivial bug fixes).

The only solution against this is to freeze for real and start the devel
tree in parallel. People are not complaining anymore about 2.4 change
speed, because every time a folk sends something, we tell him to push
that into 2.6 and not 2.4. The same thing must work with 2.6 and 2.7.
In the end, there would a general feeling that "2.6 was not as stable
as 2.8", etc... That's not a problem, there are always ups and downs
in software.
