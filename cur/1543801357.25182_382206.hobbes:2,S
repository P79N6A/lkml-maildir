xawtv4 with dmix is just silent and aborts when its queue of outstanding pcm
data is filled up.
Trying to use /dev/dsp0 starts fine for a fraction of a second but then
either stays silent or stutters until its audio-queue overflows again.
With vdr its similar: when using hw:0 it only stutters (and fills the log
with xrun errors).  I had a short look once - it uses a very small buffer
(iirc about 4kb) and gets constant underruns which it tries to handle
via prepare-something but it's unable to recover.  With dmix it works fine,
probably because of the bigger mixing buffer.
