> No. As in 2.6.18, speedstep-centrino and acpi-cpufreq are  two different drivers/modules that support Enhanced Speedstep in slightly different ways. It depends on your platform/BIOS on which one will work for your system. So you should try loading both those drivers in that order. If you have both compiled in the kernel, these drivers will be loaded (or tried to) in proper order. Please try this with the latest stable 2.6.18 kernel.
Thanks, I'll try later.
