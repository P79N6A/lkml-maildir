Yeap, I was assuming most shutdown(8)s were spinning down disks, which
apparently is wrong.  If shutdown(8) doesn't do that, you can just
upgrade the kernel and be done with it.  I'll submit update for the page
in a few hours.

Yeap, that's what's being done here.  For all SCSI disks (real SCSI,
SATA, USB, whatnot), it's now controlled by sysfs node
manage_start_stop.  Low level drivers can turn them on by default and
userland can change them by echoing to it.
