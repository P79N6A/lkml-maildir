Suppose something does change and your function is passed a NULL pointer 
after all.  What will you do about it then?  Clearly this represents a 
mistake on the part of the caller; are you simply going to return without 
doing anything and hope that nothing else will go wrong?  Or will you 
return an error code and hope that a caller careless enough to pass an 
invalid argument will also be careful enough to check the return code?
Quite a lot of places in the kernel do one of these (usually the first).
Neither of those options is attractive to me.  I would prefer something 
that leaves a clear indication that the problem exists.  A logged error 
message would help; a BUG_ON or segfault would be even better.  This is 
especially true in situations where the function in question is part of a 
relatively small subsystem where you _know_ that a NULL pointer is never 
valid.  (It may occur, but if it does it must represent an error.)
