That's not good.

The firmware downloader should be in the usb hotplug agent notifier
location.  See the linux-hotplug documentation for how to do this
properly (I thought the speedtouch driver package already did this
properly for some reason...)
Use the network scripts to start up the connection when it is seen by
the system.  Gentoo currently does this already today.

udev will delete the device node.  As for your data the user is screwed
as they did something very stupid :)
Plug the device back in, and it gets discovered, device node gets
created, and then mounted.  That is if your SATA kernel driver supports
hotpluggable disks.
