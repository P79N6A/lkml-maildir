Hi,
I'm finding it hard to get any docco on the
HDIO_DRIVE_CMD ioctl.  I want to perform a security
unlock.    Here is what I have:
args[4+512] = { SECURITY_UNLOCK, 0,0,1, 
0, PASSWORD_DATA } ;
ioctl( fd, HDIO_DRIVE_CMD, &args ) ;
Although I'm not sure this is correct?  I've started
wading through the linux ide source but as yet I can't
answer my question...
please, if you have time, drop me a line!
Lucien
