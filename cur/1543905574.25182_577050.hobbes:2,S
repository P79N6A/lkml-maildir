Reverting the patch didn't make a real difference, it only took
longer (eg 16 minutes before lockup in stead of 2-3 minutes)

Will do.
This machine(firewall) is solar powered so i tried to let it
consume as less power as possible 
This is in my startup script at the moment:
echo ondemand > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor

More testing to do, however, sunday i'm going abroad for a while,
all stuff will be in storage. If i cant find in the next few days
(packing everything in moving boxes) it might take a while before
i can test again. Sorry for that.
