Eh? How is that supposed to work?
bus gets deallocated if its associated hcd is unloaded,
so htf should usbcore know how many busses there are?
And when should that code fragment be executed?
On a telepathic signal from the user when he plugs in a USB device?
You need hcd already loaded to detect plug in events...
