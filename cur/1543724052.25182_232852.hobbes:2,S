OK that's easy then. The OOM algorithm can be changed if it is
OOMing too easily.

Well, get rid of the auto-tuning thing to start with, and merge
it into the swappiness calculation..
Regarding all these knobs, the main thing you want to avoid is
having loads of them because you can't find acceptable defaults.
I think "swappiness" is in the category of a good sysctl: it is
simple, meaningful to the admin, works, etc.
It has proven somewhat useful in testing ("set it to blah and see
if it still happens"). Or for people who know what they are doing.
