Hi all,
I've searched the list archive, but found no complete answer to my question:
what is current state of linux support for systems based on the Athlon?
If someone could point me to some on-line resource (docs, maybe some old
posting I missed...) or kindly post a brief summary on the matter...
- is the Athlon support as stable as [the support for] the other CPUs
  (Intel PII/PIII/Celeron, AMD K6, etc.)?
- do I need a development kernel, or a patched 2.2?
- are the (few) Athlon MB supported as well (I won't ask which one is
  the best, just would like to be made aware of any known problem - e.g.
  I've seen some posting on UDMA ATA66 not working well...)?
- other advices on building an Athlon based linux system?
Thanks in advance,
Gabriele Turchi
