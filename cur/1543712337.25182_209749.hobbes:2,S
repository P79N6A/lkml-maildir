The device in question there was an Iomega USB Zip 100 drive.

I wasn't sure.  USB is emulated through the SCSI layer, tho.  I would
recommend we take this discussion to the linux-scsi mailing list.

The user of the Zip 100 actually sent us logs showing this behavior.  We
assume it's coming from the SCSI system, as usb-storage doesn't contain
anything remotely resembling this....
Repeated uses of the 'eject' command generated the same sequence in his
test scenario, but his Zip 100 actually ejected the media on the second
try.  I think that's a device-dependent behavior, tho.
