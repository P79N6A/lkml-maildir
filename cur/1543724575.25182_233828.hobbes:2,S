Hi all,
I am learning linux kernel and have a question about ramdisk. When loading an 
executable in ramdisk, is the kernel loading the code all at a time to memory 
and then execute, or is it loading only a page at one time and generating a 
page fault to fetch another page?
Thanks for any comments! Waiting desprately for your help.
Lei
