Subject: Re: [PATCH] x86_64/acpi: make kernel to be compiled when CONFIG_ACPI_NUMA is set and power management with acpi is not enabled
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

grep ACPI .config
# CONFIG_X86_64_ACPI_NUMA is not set
# CONFIG_PNPACPI is not set
This config builds fine.
Let me know if you have one that doesn't.
thanks,
