kbuild: correctly skip tilded backups in localversion files
 Tildes as in path as in filenames are handled correctly now:
 only files, containing tilde '~', are backups, thus are not valid.
 [KJ]:
 Definition of `space' was removed, scripts/Kbuild.include has one.
 That definition was taken right from the GNU make manual, while Kbuild's
 version is original.

 My using of the `sh' rides from willing to have more portable,
 understandable implementation (and due to GFDL make's docs ;)
Original report by Bastian Blank:
 The following patch fixes the problem that localversion files where
 ignored if the tree lives in a path which contains a ~. It changes the
 test to apply to the filename only.
 Debian allows versions which contains ~ in it. The upstream part of the
 version is in the directory name of the build tree and we got weird
 results because the localversion files was just got ignored in this
 case.
