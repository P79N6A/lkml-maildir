It's of course preferable to present the config options in their logical 
order, but 'make config' can deal with it anyway, at the end it rechecks 
the config and it will restart the section, if it doesn't it's a bug.
I tried it here and it works fine, so if there is a problem I need some 
instruction to reproduce it.
