Hmm. I've been looking at 5.05 (from 
http://serial.sourceforge.net
),
I'm getting 2.4.4 and 2.4.5-pre2 to see what's in there.

Kernel version? Distribution? Are you using a serial console?

Yeah, I double checked the 654 and 864 sheets yesterday. No mention,
which is sorta odd for the 864, since they explicitly say to write the 0s
to get the revision. I'd have to assume that it's bad. This bit I copied
from one of our hardware guys, and it worked, so I never looked too
closely at it. My apologies.

I agree with you. However, the revision is Ted's code, and I've
generally found it easier to get our patches in to the driver if I
do what he's already doing. However, I agree with you.

The revision should always be saved if it's available. Hmm.
I didn't look carefully yesterday. The DLL always contains the
revision for the 85x family. Why do you think it doesn't?
I think your patch below is good, I'm just mystified by this
kablooey thing.
