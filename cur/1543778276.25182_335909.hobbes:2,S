AFAIK Linux ACPI expects BIOS to contain all the necessary stuff to enable
C2 and C3. Otherwise they won't get enabled, and you have to create a custom
module like the amd76x_pm is.
There's been some talk on adding a module to enable C2 and C3 states for
various chipsets, but nobody seems to have enough time to do it...
