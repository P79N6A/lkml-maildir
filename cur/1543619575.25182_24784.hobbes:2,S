This is certainly possible to do.  However, unless you are willing to fund
this development, we aren't going to do it.  We will pick up the costs of
making changes that you want if and only if we have commercial customers
who want (or are likely to want) the same thing.  Nothing personal, it's
a business and we make tradeoffs like that all the time.
Collapsing is relatively easy, it's tracking the same content in two
different sets of deltas which is hard to get exactly correct.  Certainly
possible but I can visualize what it would take and it would be messy and
disruptive to the source base for an obscure feature that is unlikely to
be used.
Why don't you actually use BK for a while and see if you really think
you need this feature.  The fact that our customers aren't clamoring for
it should tell you something.  They do work as hard and on as much code
(in many cases on the same code) as you do.
