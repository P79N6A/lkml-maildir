I generally prefer diffs against whatever is in -mm, mainly so we can see
what changed, and so that we can make sure that everyones fixups didn't get
lost.
If a patch has only been in -mm for a short period then a wholesale
replacement is OK.  It gets a bit complex because people do insist on trying
to add lots of trailing whitespace to the tree and I do insist on thwarting
them, but I fix all that up.
In this case I got anal and turned your new patch into an incremental one ;)
