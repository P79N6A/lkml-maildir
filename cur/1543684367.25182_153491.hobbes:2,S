No its fine if the process were to sleep on something. Its the
amount of time between IOs that is important (and is measured).
Makes no difference if the process is computing something or
waiting for something really.

With AS, it doesn't matter what task created the IO, its what
task will have to wait on it. In the case of async writes, we
don't care about them anyway because the pagecache means they
get done a long way behind the instruction pointer of the
process anyway, so they'll be nicely layed out anyway.
