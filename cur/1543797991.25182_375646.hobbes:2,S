Not really a kernel question. Various daemons implement something
similar using simple file locks and then sockets to pass messages
between instances of a program.
It's not the usual mentality of Linux/Unix programs but you'll find
examples that do it to look at - one is evolution, another is
mozilla/firefox as shipped by at least Fedora (not all vendors use the
single instance/multiple windows code). Various other gnome apps such as
gnome terminal support this way of working too and Gnome implements a
set of factory objects and activation system for this purpose
