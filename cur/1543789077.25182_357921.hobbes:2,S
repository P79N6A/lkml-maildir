Subject: [PATCH] Dallas's 1-wire bus compile error (again)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

hi,
playing around with "make randconfig" (don't ask :)), i noticed the
driver for the "Dallas's 1-wire bus" does not compile when CONFIG_NET is 
disabled.
this was discussed earlier in
   
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0408.1/1764.html
but the discussion ended up in arguing about using "depends" over 
"select" and the actual fix was forgotten i think.

thanks,
Christian.
