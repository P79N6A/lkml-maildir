It doesn't matter. 
You CANNOT synchronize that case anyway, and you should just realize that
and not even try too hard.
Hint: the buffer cache is the _least_ of your worries. You have the inode
cache and dcache already populated, and whatever you do to the buffer
cache will have absolutely no impact on them at all.
To be strictly safe, we should just do a complete unmount/remount after
the fsck, not just what we do now (ie a "remount" without the umount). It
hasn't ever bitten us in real use, though.
