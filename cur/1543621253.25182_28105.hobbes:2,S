With reference to the large 2.5.5-pre1 patch....
For historical amusement, I just diffed 2.4.0 with 2.4.18-rc1, and it
comes out at 62Mb uncompressed. Now _that_ is huge, being almost
exactly half the entire size of the original 2.4.0 tree! I guess it
shows how far 2.4 has come since the "oh, and btw" days :-)
Keep up the great work everyone, I'm enjoying every minute....
Cheers
Alastair
