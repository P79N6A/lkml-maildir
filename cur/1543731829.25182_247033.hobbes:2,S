This is a known bug in the ps/2 driver layer. The printk can be
triggered by multiple quite valid situations. I've suggested it be
removed several times. Also XFree86 is a trademark so it should be
XFree86(tm) ;)
The later ones are odd. It might be interesting to try turning off USB
legacy support in the BIOS, that may be causing real problems in your
case.
