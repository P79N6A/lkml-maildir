Is PROT_SEM necessary anymore? 2.5.46 does not seem to include any
references to it that adjust behaviour for pages. Would it be
reasonable to remove it, or #define PROT_SEM to (0) to avoid
confusion?
I am beginning to play with the FUTEX system call. I am hoping that
PROT_SEM is not required, as I intend to scatter the words throughout
memory, and it would be a real pain to mprotect(PROT_SEM) each page
that contains a FUTEX word.
For systems that do not support the FUTEX system call (2.4.x?),
is sched_yield() the best alternative?
Thanks,
mark
