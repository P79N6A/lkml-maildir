I agree that the issue is mostly size, not speed.  What makes X large isn't
primarily the video drivers, it is the whole framework (server, xlib, toolkit,
wm).  The core of Windows 3.1/9x is most if not all hand-written assembler
that is very tight.  X is just much larger.
That said, I think you could get a 4MB system working acceptably well with X
if you used a small window manager and small apps.  Something like GNOME or
KDE is out of the question.
