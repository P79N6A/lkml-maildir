Hi all
                   I need to know some basic facts about interprocess
communication. I have a process A which is waiting for some other process B.
When B is executed, it has to wake up A and do some work with A. How to do
this. I think it will be better to use signals. 
1  How to use signals
2  Is there any other ideas other than signals
3  It is better if u send some sample codes
