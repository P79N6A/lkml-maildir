Not sure about the two port, but for example the SX8 is 180 dollars at
pricewatch.com, while an Areca 12-port starts at 756 dollars. That is
22.5 dollars per port vs 63 dollars per port. More or less the same goes
for 3Ware.
Of course you can't compare Areca/3Ware with the SX8 feature-wise, but
all I need JBOD.
