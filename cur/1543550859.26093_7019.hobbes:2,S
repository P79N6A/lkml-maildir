IANAL, but I believe that once you've implemented a method in a released
product, you have only one year to file the patents for it.  If you don't
file patents for it within this time period, it becomes public domain.  I
think it would be possible to invalidate their patents, but I don't think
it would be possible to get your own patent on it after the fact and refuse
to let them use it.
