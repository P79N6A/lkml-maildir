Nonsense.  You were talking about 16/32/64 way boxes, go read your own mail.
In fact, you said so in this message.
Furthermore, I can prove that isn't what you are talking about.  Show me
the performance gains you are getting on 4way systems from your changes.
Last I checked, things scaled pretty nicely on 4 ways.

Yes, we do.  You just don't like what the numbers are saying.  You can
work backward from the size of the server market and the percentages
claimed by Sun, HP, IBM, etc.  If you do that, you'll see that even
if Dell was making 100% margins on every server they sold, that still
wouldn't be 51% of their profits.
It's not "probably true", it's not physically possible that it is true
and if you don't know that you are simply waving your hands and not 
doing any math.

Well, you are flat out 100% wrong.

Read the mail I've posted on topic, the data is there.  Or better yet,
don't trust me, go work it out for yourself, it isn't hard.

Ahh, now we're getting somewhere.  As soon as we get anywhere near real
numbers, you don't want anything to do with it.  Why is that?

It happens all the time.

Wow.  Compelling.  "It is so because I say it is so".  Jeez, forgive me 
if I'm not falling all over myself to have that sort of engineering being
the basis for scaling work.
