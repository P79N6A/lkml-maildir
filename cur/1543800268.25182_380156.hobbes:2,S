I hope you're not depending on the VM_LOCKED thing.. since the user can
just undo that easily!
(this is also why all this "sys_mlock from the driver" is traditionally
buggy to the point of being a roothole, things like some of the binary
3D drivers have had this security hole for a long time, as did some of
the early infiniband drivers)
