What this probably means is that we need some way to turn off interrupts
from devices on suspend, and on resume, keep them off until drivers
have had a chance to quiesce all devices, turn them back on, and then
do full resume.
The "quiesce" stage needs to take account of whether devices are
accessible (eg, USB mice and keyboards won't be because the USB host
controller isn't resumed.)
(and no I don't have a patch for this - I think this requires another
rework of the PM subsystem and drivers.) ;(
