It is quite likely that the interrupts are set based on the DN.  Now if
they use whatever the parent slot uses as INTD as INTA for the second
slot (since it is set to 19 which is 1 below 20 of the main slot), then
that probably isn't what the BIOS is likely to assign.  It really sounds
like via decided to do things their own way and only riser cards done
their way, or riser cards with a pci to pci bridge are going to work
with it.

Does the documentation say which interrupts are INTA, B, C and D on the
main board?  I would expect slot 20 to have INTA mapped to INTA but then
again being a weird main board it doesn't have to be that way.  It is
certainly possible via decided to just support DN19 and 20 and assign
them both INTA, which would certainly make for a very simple riser card.
