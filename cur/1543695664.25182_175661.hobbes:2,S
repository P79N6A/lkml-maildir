Linus: this fixes a real bug which causes an oops on PPC in the case
where you try to load one module, but the init routine fails, and then
you try to load another module.  What happens is that the
module_finalize() call on the first module adds the module to a list
used in BUG() handling.  If the init routine fails, the code currently
doesn't call module_arch_cleanup(), which is where we remove the
module from the list used for BUG handling.  When you try to load the
next module, the BUG list head is pointing to a module which is no
longer there and you get an oops.
Please apply.
Thanks,
Paul.
