theres some individual patches for single files dating back a while, but
nothing comprehensive. i'll start tieing things together for 2.5,
perhaps starting with the  fs/ subtree which nobody seems to have
touched in a while.  it would be nice to declare 2.5 a strtok free zone.
most people are using strtok to seperate options, using exactly the same
syntax.  what are your thoughts on creating a strsep() macro to replace
them?
