Available time is defined to be (real_time - stolen_time).  i.e. time in 
which the vcpu is either running or not ready to run [because it is 
halted, and nothing is pending]).
So, yes, it is per-vcpu.  But, the sched_clock() samples are rebased 
when processes are migrated between runqueues; search sched.c for 
most_recent_timestamp.  It's not perfect since most_recent_timestamp 
between cpu0 and cpu1 do not correspond to the exact same instant, but 
does prevent negative sleep time and is fairly close.
