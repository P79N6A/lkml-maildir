there's another patch ontop which I didn't bother to redo until this is
accepted which kills a lot more code.  After that filesystems only have
to implement one method each for all kinds of read/write calls.  Which
allows to both make the mm/filemap.c far less complex and actually
understandable aswell as for any filesystem that uses more complex
read/write variants than direct filemap.c calls.  In addition to these
simplification we also get a feature (async vectored I/O) for free.
