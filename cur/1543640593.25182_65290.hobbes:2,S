Hi,
After installing new debian stable with gcc 2.95.4, kernel 2.4.17 
stopped linking. The error is "undefined reference to local symbols...". 
Problem seems to appear in different parts of the kernel at some time or 
another. This is patch against 2.4.17 that I am using at this time. This 
patch should apply to 2.4.18 and 2.4.19 as well. There seems to be 
something tricky about __exit macro and 2.95.4 compiler.
For people getting error:
drivers/mtd/mtdlink.o(.text.lock+0x26c): undefined reference to `local 
symbols in discarded section .text.exit'
here is the patch that seems to fix it.
Thanks,
Alex
