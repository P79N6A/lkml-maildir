Sorry; that's not accurate.  Here's a counterexample.  Let x and y be
two 80-bit strings.  Assume that x is either 0 or 1 (equal probability
for both possibilities).  Assume y is either 0 or 2 (equal probability
for both possibilities), and is independent of x.  Then
  entropy(x) = 1 bit
  entropy(y) = 1 bit
  entropy(x xor y) = 2 bits
The difference between F and G is very small, and there is not much
basis for choosing one over the other.
