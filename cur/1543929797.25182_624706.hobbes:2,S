ok, i did that and rebuilt. I also did "make check" and got 
src/pthread_sync which i can run. The only thing i'm missing, if i run 
src/pthread_sync, it outputs "PARALLEL time":
 PARALLEL time =                           22.486103 microseconds +/- 3.944821
 PARALLEL overhead =                       10.638658 microseconds +/- 10.854154
not "BARRIER time". I've re-read the discussion and found no hint about 
how to build and run a barrier test. Either i missed it or it's so 
obvious to you that you didnt mention it :-)
