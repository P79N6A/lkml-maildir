Change the constant 0x03 to 0x13 on line 136 in inputattach.c, and it
will work with --mmwheel.

Yes, this is a known fact and still has to be fixed.

I'll try to play more with this - right now you should be able to use the
'i8042_noaux=1' parameter of the kernel/module to disable the AUX port
probing in case of problems with it.
This is a problem of specific i8042's that trash their register contents
after writing to a port nothing is connected to.

Okay, changed the direction. And I hope to have a HID parser in a reasonable
time ... Andreas Gal <gal@cs.uni-magdeburg.de> already has some code, which
looks fairly good, so lets hope this works out.

Umm, this is odd. I really have no idea about how this could happen. I'll
think about it, though.
