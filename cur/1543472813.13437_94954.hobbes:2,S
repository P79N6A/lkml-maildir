I started thinking about the essential differences between
software/algorithms and hardware for patent purposes.  Here is my
thought:
Mass production of physical devices (hardware) is very expensive.  The
equipment involved may cost millions or billions of dollars.  Most
independent inventors and small companies have too little capital to
mass-produce a device.  Patents were created, in part, to allow these
inventors+companies to profit from their inventions anyway.  They can
patent the invention, then license it to a large manufacturer with the
necessary equipment.  If nobody wants to license, they can try
manufacturing it themselves.  If patents did not exist, then a small
company's inventions would immediately be grabbed by large corporations
capable of profiting from them.
The situation is different with software.  If I come up with a new
algorithm, I am as capable as any other to produce and distribute
software based on that algorithm.  The big companies have less inherent
advantage (advertising still plays a role.....).  Also, a new algorithm
might lead to hundreds of different new products.  Thus, the
restrictions imposed on a patented algorithm serve little purpose, and
squash innovation.
