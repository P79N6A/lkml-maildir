Linux isn't yet up to having 500 simultaneous interactive
users, in fact I don't think it has ever been up to this
situation.
It'll probably work in many cases, but Linux just doesn't
have graceful degradation and code to cope with bad load
spikes (again, yet ... people are looking at handling this
stuff).
That doesn't mean Linux isn't working in your situation,
if it works right now it'll continue working right, chances
are it should run better in 2.6.

Rik
