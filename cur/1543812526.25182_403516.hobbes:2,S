Hi all,
I'm writing a framebuffer driver, which should be under the folder
"./drivers/video/mydriver.c".
The video controller in my driver need a I2C driver to do some setting.
I found there is already a driver which can be used under the folder
"./drivers/media/video/adv7170.c". Another video driver also uses it.
You see, they are in the different folder and there is no special
configuration menu for the I2C driver "adv7170.c". So, what's the best
way to use the existing driver? Now the easiest way is copying the
driver to my framebuffer folder and add it to the makefile. But I
don't think it's the best way.
Thanks any hints,
Regards,
-Aubrey
