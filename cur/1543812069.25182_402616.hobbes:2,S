It's probably for the second cores. Instead of rewriting the tables
dynamically they just change the enable/disable bit.  That's pretty
common actually, often seen on laptops too.
With Quadcores it will get interesting I guess.
If you had to write in 16bit x86 asm you would likely use such
tricks too ;-)

It should be four.
