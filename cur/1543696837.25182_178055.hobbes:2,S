Sounds like after the locking in the current patches fixed, this
should perhaps be implemented and compared for locking complexity
and memory consumption.

Would a smaller replacement for the sysfs_dirent structure to link
just leaf nodes to kobject be close to what infrastructural
modifications you are talking about ?
