I'd be _much_ happier if
 - the patch wasn't totally whitespace-damaged (your mailer seems 
   to not only remove spaces at the end of lines, it _also_ adds them to 
   the beginning when there was another space there, as far as I can tell)
   Being right "on average" thanks to having two different bugs does not a 
   good mailer make.
 - you were to separate out the oops-fixing code from the code that adds 
   handling for that (strange?) model type logic.
   It seems that the _oops_ is because the later paths just assume that 
   it's a ACPI_TYPE_STRING and will dereference "model->string.pointer" 
   regardless of whether that is true or not. And you add a test for 
   ACPI_TYPE_INTEGER, however, you do _not_ fix the oops for any other 
   type, so the exact _same_ bug is still waiting to happen if there is 
   some other strange ACPI table entry some day.
So I think the proper fix is to _first_ just do something like
	if (model->type != ACPI_TYPE_STRING)
		goto unknown;
which should fix the oops (no?), and then handling ACPI_TYPE_INTEGER above 
that as one case would be a separate patch.
