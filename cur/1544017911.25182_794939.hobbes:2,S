the scheduler affects almost everything, so almost by definition a 
scheduler change can tickle a race or other timing bug in just about any 
code - and reverting that change in the scheduler can make the bug go 
away. But yes, it could also be a genuine scheduler bug - that is always a 
possibility.
Could you please run a cfs-debug-info.sh session on a CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG=y 
and CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS=y kernel, while you are experiencing those 
latencies:
  
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/cfs-scheduler/tools/cfs-debug-info.sh
and post that (relatively large) somewhere, or send it as a reply after 
bzip2 -9 compressing it? It will include a lot of information about the 
delays your tasks are experiencing.
