The other side of the problem is that most people reading here don't
read netdev, so you don't trigger the "I have that too, and didn't
report it because I thought it was just me" replies. That's an imperfect
way to run the world, but it does reflect human nature.
I personally hesitate to post to netdev until I have really researched
a problem, as opposed to reporting that something working in testN
fails in test{N+1}. Given my free time, that often means that someone
else reports a bug (usually here) first.
Your continued reminders when appropriate are useful, perhaps an
occasional forward of a message would be as well.
