Red Hat will ship two kernels. Well, they actually ship now about 4 ones
or something. So they will ship 8.
Plus they will ship a script that recompiles kernel without user crawling
in documentation.
It should be an option in linuxconf: recompile local kernel:
debug-nodebug-optimized-localized-nonmodular-server-router-workstation
which compiles and installs 2  hardware/situation optimized/configured
kernels: debug and production.
I am sure company like redhat can ship a little new linuxconf module.
Don't worry, people can make good use of multiple options.
If you provide orthogonal tools they will provide orthogonal solutions.
