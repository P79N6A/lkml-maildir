Good stuff. I've cc'ed Con Kolivas in on this as he's just recently posted his 
updated "Autoregulated VM swappiness" patch. In particular, this could also 
cause some issues if it made it into the main tree, as then this code might 
fail/cause issues (eg: as both could end up writing to vm_swappiness at the 
same time). This could possibly be a race condition as per Oliver's earlier 
observation (even if it's non-fatal, it's at least annoying).
Just thinking that Con could check to see somehow wether we're going to 
suspend, and not touch vm_swappiness anymore if that's the case. Yes I know 
the code isn't in the main tree yet, but who knows when another writer to 
vm_swappiness might end up in the main tree. It may also prove a good example 
for other potential writers. Pavel, Nigel, (anyone?) suggestions?
