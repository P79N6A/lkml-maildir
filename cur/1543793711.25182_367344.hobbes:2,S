I began implementing first in /sys/classes and that is
when I ran into the nested class issue. I then looked
at the /sys/devices/system interface point and then
sought more information and then ASKED for RFC from
the list.
I will now use the /sys/devices/system/edac as my root
for my files and controls.
Speaking of controls, edac has them  currently in
/proc/sys/mc. I have proposed to have them in
/sys/devices/system/edac/mc and friends. 
My question is:  Should I remove entirely my old
/proc/sys/mc sysctl tree? Or still maintain the
aliases there (which seems weird)? 
If I do that, then /etc/sysctl.conf will no longer
allow for setting things up there.
Is there going to be a similiar functionality as
/etc/sysctl.conf for those items we place in sysfs, in
the future?
thanks

PS. These questions on sysfs seem a perfect food
stream for your 'HOWTO do kernel development'. Trying
to do new entries in sysfs has been a painstaking
adventure. After googling the web for info, it
definitely has been a bit thin on information on sysfs
at the level I am seeking.
