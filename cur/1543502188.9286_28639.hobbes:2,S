I've never had update die on me to my knowledge.
But, I do know the consequences of not running update.
They are very bad, much worse than minor corruption.
I removed update when I ran the 2.2.x kernel which claimed it wasn't
necessary.  I forget to put it back when I upgraded and it was required
again.
This was very bad: I lost a lot of files simply because they never got
written to disk.  And fsck didn't show many errors.  (In at least one
case, no errors at all).
IMO fsck silently succeeding but me losing several days of files is
pretty bad.
