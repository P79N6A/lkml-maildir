Another important point is time.
I continue to agree that a native block driver is the best direction.
But with 2.6.0 looming, I think it's best to evolve my ATA driver to be 
a native block driver from a scsi one.   Not start out as a native 
driver.  That's significant pre-2.6 churn.
Or, it lives out-of-tree until 2.7 and people with SATA hardware have to 
go out-of-tree for their driver for months and months, until the working 
driver is deemed sufficiently native :)  In the meantime, distros 
wanting working SATA will just ship the SCSI driver as-is.  :(
