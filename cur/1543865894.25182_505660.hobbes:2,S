I was looking forward to these patches for so long.

Not only AppArmor, but also TOMOYO Linux needs these patches.
TOMOYO Linux is a pathname based access control patch like AppArmor.

I have been asked "Why not use LSM?" and the answer is always
"I can't, for VFS helper functions and LSM functions don't receive vfsmount."
and I am manually patching locations that call VFS helper functions.
But if these Tony's patches are accepted in upstream,
TOMOYO Linux would be able to use LSM.
I think these patches are also useful for auditing functions, for
auditing logs will be able to include absolute pathname
instead of partial pathname.
I think most people want access logs in the form of pathnames
rather than security labels.
