Are you sure it's a good idea to do this?  This patch is 1200 lines long
... the same size as the existing driver:
$ wc drivers/scsi/hptiop.*
  947  2273 24531 drivers/scsi/hptiop.c
  256   612  6175 drivers/scsi/hptiop.h
  1203  2885 30706 total
That suggests to me there's not much commonality between the two drivers,
and you'd be better off adding a second driver for the 4xxx cards.
