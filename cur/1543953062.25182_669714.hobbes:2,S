Ho hum.  Lots of cc's added.

The usual pattern for most of the above is
	if (!in_atomic())
		do_something_which_might_sleep();
problem is, in_atomic() returns false inside spinlock on non-preptible
kernels.  So if anyone calls those functions inside spinlock they will
incorrectly schedule and another task can then come in and try take the
already-held lock.
Now, it happens that in_atomic() returns true on non-preemtible kernels
when running in interrupt or softirq context.  But if the above code really
is using in_atomic() to detect am-i-called-from-interrupt and NOT
am-i-called-from-inside-spinlock, they should be using in_irq(),
in_softirq() or in_interrupt().
