I don't support this scheme either ;-)
That's why my proposal is to find a way to allow input packet
processing even during tcp_recvmsg() work.  It is a solution that
would give the TCP task exactly it's time slice, no more, no less,
without the erroneous behavior of sleeping with packets held in the
socket backlog.
