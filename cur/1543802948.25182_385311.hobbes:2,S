Thanks, the patch sequence is:
1) pristine kernel 2.6.15
2) suspend2 patch 2.2-rc16 (I used the apply script incl in the source tarball) [0]
3) realtime-preempt 2.6.15-rt2
Of  course the  suspend2  patch applies happily,   but when I try with
realtime-preempt I get some rejects, here is the log:

+suspend2+rt.log
Cheers,
Free
