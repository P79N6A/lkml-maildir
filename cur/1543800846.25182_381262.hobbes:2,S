__ only skips the access_ok which checks the kernel/user boundary, and the 
kernel/user boundary doesn't change even while sleeping.
On very early 386s it did something more to work around a CPU bug, but that is 
racy on multithreaded processes in any case. Not really worth caring about.
Also I doubt any such machines are left in working condition. That old 
workaround code could be probably safely removed by now.
