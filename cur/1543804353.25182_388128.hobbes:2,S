Subject: [PATCH 0/5] ia64 ioremap, DMI, EFI system table

OK, here's a set of patches to (hopefully) clean up this area
a bit:
1  Simplify efi_mem_attribute_range() so I can use it both for
   /dev/mem validation and ioremap() attribute checking.
2  Make ia64 ioremap() check memory attributes, so it works for
   plain memory that only supports write-back access, as well as
   for MMIO space that only supports uncacheable access.
3  DMI ioremaps too much space, which makes it fail on machines
   where the SMBIOS table is near the end of a memory region.
4  Keep EFI table addresses as physical, not virtual.  The SMBIOS
   address was physical on x86 but virtual on ia64, which broke
   dmi_scan_machine().
5  Use smarter ioremap() implementation to remove some cruft in
   acpi_os_{read,write,map}_memory().  This one's just an optional
   cleanup; I don't think it fixes any bugs.
