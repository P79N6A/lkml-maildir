kioslaves such as camera, smb, etc.. are obvious to replace (and this has 
already happened from what I can see), and I think are a good idea. We have a 
single mountpoint for these things, for example:
 /camera/mycamera/picture1.png
 /smb/workgroup/computer/share/file.blah
How would you go about replacing a kioslaves which operate "somewhere in the 
middle" (i dunno the correct technical term) such as tar? In other words how 
would tar:/home/foo/bar.tar.bz2/baz/picture.png work with a FUSE (so 
reiserfs4 is not a valid answer to this question) filesystem?
Just some thoughts,
 Florian
