Hi,
Below is a small patch that fixes the oops that happens in the latest
2.6 kernels when you plug in a keyspan or whiteheat usb to serial
device.  Thanks to Ben for pointing out that there is a problem, and to
Pat for finding where the problem was (in my code, not his :)
I'll be sending it on to Linus next week, but here is is for those
people who want to use their devices again.
thanks,
greg k-h
