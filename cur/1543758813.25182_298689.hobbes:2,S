In most of the cases I'm thinking of, it wouldn't be a user requesting a 
state but rather software (say, a cell phone progressively entering 
lower power states due to inactivity).  I haven't noticed a platform 
with more than 3 low-power modes so far, but I'm sure it'll happen soon. 
  If the time isn't right for incompatible changes to these interfaces 
then I guess mapping standby and mem to platform-specific things will 
work for now, maybe with some tweak to allow a choice of actual state 
entered.  At some more opportune time in the future I'll suggest an 
attribute that allows a choice of platform-specific method of 
suspend-to-mem, somewhat like the "disk" attribute for suspend-to-disk. 
  Thanks,
