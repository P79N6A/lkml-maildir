Hi,
Can sombody help me with the following:
How to differentiate kernel threads from normal
processes inside the Linux kernel code? 
I want to handle all the processes headed by "init_ 
task", in such a way that kernel threads are excluded
in the special processing. But , I am not able to find
out a kernel data structure which helps me in
identifying whether the "task_struct" is a normal
process or a kernel thread.
For ex, if i use the following snippet of code,
 for(p=&init_task; (p=next_task(p)) != &init_task;)
 {
        printk("%s\n", p->comm);
 } 
it prints all the processes running including kernel
threads(init, keventd, kswapd etc etc). Now, I want to
check whether the "task_struct" is a process or a
kernel thread? 
How do I handle processes seperately from kernel
threads??
Thank you,
Vinay.
