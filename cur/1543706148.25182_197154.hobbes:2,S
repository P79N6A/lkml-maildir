The Thinkpad T40 and T41 at least; they suspend & resume properly, but 
there are still interrupt-losing problems when resuming, which is a 
totally separate issue. I believe they both use the 8255PM chipset:
00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corp. 82855PM Processor to I/O Controller 
(rev 03)
There have been a few discussions on the ACPI list about this, as well 
as bugs 1661 and 1409.
