Andrew, is it possible for changing your tpp format such that transient
text comes on the top followed by the change log and signed-off-by...
Transient text will have more info about the patch in the context of
an ongoing lkml thread conversation. Hence it makes sense to be on top rather
than somewhere in between the changelog and the patch.
I will def add more appropriate changelog text..

typically yes. cpuhotplug or exclusive cpusets can change it..

No. This is not possible.

init_sched_groups_power is called for each cpu in the cpu_map and hence for
all the cpus in a group.

Question doesn't make sense... each domain has it own specific groups..

Please see the find_busiest_group() code and how its uses cpu_power.
For example if a group has two tasks and if its cpu_power is
1 * SCHED_LOAD_SCALE, then any other idle group in the domain will pickup
the extra task. I have explained the significance of the 'multiple' in the
comments.

compiler will be doing it. Anyhow I will include this change, as it is cleaner.
