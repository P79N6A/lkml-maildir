Shouldn't we rather fix the SCSI low level drivers or SCSI transport 
layers to trigger device releases only from process context? (Instead of 
SCSI core transparently falling back to a workqueue, that is.)
I know only one of these drivers, hence I don't know which are actually 
affected and how much work that would be.
