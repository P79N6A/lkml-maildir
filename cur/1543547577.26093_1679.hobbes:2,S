I don't want to extend kiobufs for that sort of thing, since the
entire point of having kiobufs is to have a uniform container with
which to pass information between different kernel components.  If you
need more data, you'd do something like the SGI kiobuf-based block IO
stack does --- use a dedicated struct request, but use a pointer to a
kiobuf as the data location within that request struct.
In principle I'd think it would be a lot easier to add a kiovec
pointer to an skbuff than to extend kiobufs to be suitable for the
networking stack (and we had a BOF on this at OLS --- it seemed quite
feasible).
