yes, Chris is working on it for a few months.
just for the mmap_sem the easiest fix I proposed him, was to take the
mmap_sem in read mode before starting the transaction in prepare_write,
then the mmap_sem has to become recursive but that's trivial (my 2.4
rw semaphores are much simpler, they don't crash with million of
waiters, and they can support recursion).
however it seems the mmap_sem is not the only issue, he found another
issue with the page lock, maybe Chris you want to elaborate (the above
deadlock is absolutely clear, the one with the page lock less, btw, I
don't care much with reading the same page from disk that we're writing
to in the write syscall, that's a case we may just want to forbidden
since it makes no sense and currently it's racey even in 2.4, no pin
happens, but the prefaulting hides it).
We also hidden the above deadlock with prefaulting (but it's far from
fixed), prefaulting is a good idea anyways.
