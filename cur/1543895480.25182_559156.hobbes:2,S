I did indeed just miss it. I intended to apply it (and actually thought I 
had), but I see it's still just an email in that long thread. 
(It's often a good idea to re-write the subject line and make it be that 
standard "[PATCH] ..description..", because that just makes it show up 
much better when I go through my unread emails.. Not that that is any 
kind of *guarantee* that I won't miss it).
Anyway, no need to re-send, it's now *really* in my queue of things to 
apply.
