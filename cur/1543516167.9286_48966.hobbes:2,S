Ok, I finally got the ethertap-device to work. It seems I did
forget to include something :)
But now I wonder; in the docs it is stated that ethernet-frames
are passed trough this interface, but when I run something simple
as:
(some code removed)
        fdin = open("/dev/tap0", O_RDWR);
        for(;;)
        {
                char buf[1514];
                int     n;
                n = read(fdin, buf, 1514, 0);
                if (n>0)
                {
                        struct ethhdr *eth = (struct ethhdr *)buf;
                        struct iphdr *iph  = (struct iphdr
*)(eth+ETH_HLEN);
                        cnt++;
                        printf("%03d] ", cnt); disp_mac(eth ->
h_source);
                        printf(" ");           disp_mac(eth -> h_dest);
                        printf(" %04x|", eth -> h_proto);
                        if (eth -> h_proto == 0x0800)
                        {
                                disp_ipa(iph -> saddr); printf(" ");
disp_ipa(iph -> daddr);
                                printf(" %02x %d %d", iph -> protocol,
iph -> tot_len, iph -> ttl);
                        }
                        printf("\n");
                }
        }
and I do a ping to some non-existing host on the tap0-device
I get output like:
001] ff:ff:fe:fd:00:00 fb:0f:ff:ff:ff:ff 0000|
002] ff:ff:fe:fd:00:00 fb:0f:ff:ff:ff:ff 0000|
003] ff:ff:fe:fd:00:00 fb:0f:ff:ff:ff:ff 0000|
004] ff:ff:fe:fd:00:00 fb:0f:ff:ff:ff:ff 0000|
I'm not sure about the hardware-address (which looks funny to me - maybe
I have to little endian some things), but that protocol-field:
0x0000?!?!
( the disp_mac-routine:
void disp_mac(unsigned char *adr)
{
        int     loop;
        for(loop=0; loop<ETH_ALEN; loop++)
        {
                printf("%02x", adr[loop]);
                if (loop<(ETH_ALEN-1))
                {
                        printf(":");
                }
        }
}
)
