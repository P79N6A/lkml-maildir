Hi Mike,
I haven't looked at it and I don't recall seeing
any email from anyone else on the linux-usb
mailing list who has looked at DevFS.
I don't disagree with your (guesstimate) evaluation
of USB and DevFS.
> Anyone even know what the USB hierarchy in the
> DevFS namespace should look like?
I'm no expert (or even User yet) on DevFS.
My guess is simply /dev/usb/something.
Where would I look for some examples of other
devices/buses?
in linux/Documentation/filesystems/devfs/mk-devlinks
or ...................................../README ?
I'm interested in your feedback and help on this.
Thanks,
~Randy  [www.linux-usb.org]
