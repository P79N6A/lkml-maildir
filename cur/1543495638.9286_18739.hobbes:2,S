Damn WRONG in fact, since top doesn't use that method anymore.

That is interesting, but also bad. There is simply no way for top to
atomically read all of /proc, so you still get odd numbers.
The current code is below. Feel free to improve it.
---------
This function determines how CPU ticks were used since it was last called.
It returns crummy data the first time it is called, but that isn't as
annoying as the old method.
#define JT unsigned long
int four_cpu_numbers(JT *uret, JT *nret, JT *sret, JT *iret) {   
    static JT u, n, s, i;
    JT user_j, nice_j, sys_j, idle_j;
    FILE_TO_BUF(STAT_FILE,stat_fd);
    sscanf(buf, "cpu %lu %lu %lu %lu", &user_j, &nice_j, &sys_j, &idle_j);
    SET_IF_DESIRED(uret, user_j-u);
    SET_IF_DESIRED(nret, nice_j-n);
    SET_IF_DESIRED(sret,  sys_j-s);
    SET_IF_DESIRED(iret, idle_j-i); 
    u=user_j;
    n=nice_j;
    s=sys_j;
    i=idle_j;
    return 0;
}
#undef JT

This bit of code prints out the values.
four_cpu_numbers(&user_ticks,&nice_ticks,&system_ticks,&idle_ticks);
do{
    unsigned long sum;
    sum = user_ticks+nice_ticks+system_ticks+idle_ticks;
    user_ticks   = (user_ticks   * 1000) / sum;
    system_ticks = (system_ticks * 1000) / sum;
    nice_ticks   = (nice_ticks   * 1000) / sum;
    idle_ticks   = (idle_ticks   * 1000) / sum;
}while(0);
printf("CPU states:"
    " %2ld.%ld%% user, %2ld.%ld%% system,"
    " %2ld.%ld%% nice, %2ld.%ld%% idle",
    user_ticks   / 10UL,   user_ticks   % 10UL,
    system_ticks / 10UL,   system_ticks % 10UL,
    nice_ticks   / 10UL,   nice_ticks   % 10UL,
    idle_ticks   / 10UL,   idle_ticks   % 10UL
);
