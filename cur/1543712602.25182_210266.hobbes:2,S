In looking at the latest and greatest glibc spec file for Fedora, it
appears that on x86 architectures, glibc is built to support all the way
down to 2.2.5.  On 64 bit arches, its set for various 2.4 kernels.  If
you are using Red Hat or Fedora, you will probably be ok.  Any other
distro and I can't help you there.  If it is just these drivers that are
holding you to 2.2, you can certainly find folks willing to port them to
2.4 or 2.6 for a reasonable fee that is quite certainly less than the
amount of man hours you will spend trying to get this house of cards
together.  Depending on what the drivers do and how they are written, it
may be trivial or it may be quite involved.
