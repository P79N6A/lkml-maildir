I am getting the following in my kernel log output:
"Failed to execute /etc/init lang=us apm=power-off root=/dev/hda6
video=nvidiafb:1024x768 ro nomce.  Attempting defaults..."
I notice that a patch to generate this message was added in
2.6.14-rc3.  I don't understand the purpose of this patch, or whether
this error indicated some important problem with my Debian SID
configuration.
To see the patch, check here:

A possibly related problem I am attempting to track down is that
nvidiafb is not correctly receiving it's video= option parameter. 
Specifically, I am using:
cat /proc/cmdline
"init=/etc/init lang=us apm=power-off root=/dev/hda6
video=nvidiafb:1024x768 ro nomce"
But nvidiafb is only seeing:
nvidiafb: mode_option = <NULL>
Any ideas?  Is this related?
Thanks!
         Miles
