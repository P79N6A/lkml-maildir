Looks like good bug hunting.  I will have to look but it might
make more sense to simply fix: struct IO_APIC_route_entry,
or use whatever technique we normally use to generate the io_apic
vectors.
I don't recall enough off of the top of my head to recall what
the discrimination rule between logical and physical is but
I think setting the system in physical mode is a good clue :)
