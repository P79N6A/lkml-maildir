Forgetting old_pm for the moment, that gives:
new_pP = fP | (fI & old_pI) | (old_pP & persistent_pP_config);

You can and should remove the root magic from exec.c, but it has to stay
in other places. For example, a UID change using standard system calls
would have to drop some bits. We could have a Linux-specific system call
that would change UID without dropping bits.

That might be good enough in a courtroom, but I certainly don't want
to give CAP_X to every user on the system. Remember, super is an admin.
Requirement 0, the implied one, is that you can't just give away CAP_X
to everyone by putting it in fP. Normal users don't get special power
when they run the executable.
What this could be: the executable is a "safe rm" tool with the right
to move any file. One admin can always move files, while the other admin
only gets that power when using this one tool. Normal users are free to
use the tool of course.

This is a major security problem. You now have to search the whole
filesystem and add ACLs to every file that might grant CAP_X.
(oh, we don't support ACLs anyway) If you encounter a file that
restricted users need to run without special power, you have a problem.
You could hack around the problem by keeping two copies of the executable
and using a script wrapper or $PATH difference maybe. This gross
solution would be very hard to maintain.

This part won't make sense until you solve the first problem correctly.

Mostly this is a source of DoS attacks AFAIK. There have been security
problems caused by resource limits that kill a setuid process after it
has done only part of what it was going to do. I think that these exploits
will occur by accident when pI is partially full.
Also, I'm sure most people have an opinion about this:
Option 1: permission denied
Option 2: crashes and other confusing failures

I mostly agree. I think that this mechanism should also restrict the
new pP and pE values.
