I've been kept busy with other things for a while and haven't had the time 
to reply to your emails, sorry.   As I just said in another post I don't

see if I can get some more solid results.

I'll gather some more numbers and post them along with any conclusions I 
believe can be drawn from them within a day or two, untill then I'll hold
