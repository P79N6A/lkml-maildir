That would probably require one more parameter to 
cin_encrypt/cia_decrypt, something like "nblocks" which currently is 
always 1 and one more struct crypto_alg field that would help upper 
level to decide how many blocks it can safely encrypt/decrypt() at a 
time before crypto_yield(). This value depends on algorithm speed and 
should be chosen to make overhead smaller. It could  be > 1 even for 
fast block ciphers and should be > 1 for stream ciphers.
