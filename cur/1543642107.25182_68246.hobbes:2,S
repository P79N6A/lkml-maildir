There are things like O_DIRECT for this.  A fine add-on for
some apps, and it don't break the fs for all those apps that
like caching.  
A uncached distributed fs is another story.  Having to void
all cache (or no cache at all) whenever some other machine
locks the fs might be just the ticket for some applications,
but I can't see that working for the generic case.  
Which is why
I think a special fs is in place here.  It could possibly start
off as a fork from ext2 (or ntfs or vfat or whatever seems
appropriate) but I cannot see how this sort of thing could be merged.
And why force it into _every_ existing fs?  This distributed
scheme really needs all of them?

Making a good new fs might take time, but changing all existing
fs'es to support "no caching when another guy has the lock"
is so invasive that I'd call it a set of new fs'es, and I think
he'll need some time to get that working _well_. 
I believe a special purpose fs for special needs is easier
in this case.

A completely different approach, avoiding the trouble of
drastically altering something that works.
