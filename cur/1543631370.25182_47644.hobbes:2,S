That's _very_ nice to see.  I don't know about -dj, but it's definitely
a step in right direction for the main tree.
Other things that need to be done:
a) propagate struct block_device * on the kernel side.  It's not a trivial
change - unlike kdev_t struct block_device * might leak.  So you will need
to add proper refcounting to uses in lvm*.c and from my fighting with
lvm code I can say that it won't be easy.
b) check all copy_{from,to}_user() in lvm for buffer overruns.  The damn thing
is choke-full of them - e.g. it happily assumes that
	n = <get a number from userland>;
	p = (struct foo *)kmalloc(n * sizeof(struct foo), ...);
	if (!p)
		return -ENOMEM;
	for (i = 0; i<n; i++) {
		copy_from_user(p+i, user_p+i, sizeof(struct foo));
		...
	}
is OK.  It isn't - if value of n is slightly above 2^32/sizeof(struct foo)
you will get fairly small argument of kmalloc() (multiplication is done
modulo 2^32) and kmalloc() succeeds, allocating <small amount> instead of
4Gb + <small amount> assumed by the loop below.
(as a sidenote, I have to say that I'm absolutely amazed by the number of
people who manage to fuck up on that one.  A lot of userland code and even
some places in kernels (including several Linux drivers, etc.) contain bugs
of that sort.  It's a _lot_ of buffer overruns - and in the code that is way
more decent than lvm or retchmail.  People, arithmetics is done modulo
2^(number of bits in integer type).  Product of two large numbers can be
small, ditto for sums, etc. and you need to check for overflows of that kind -
nobody else will do that for you).
c) eliminate kdev_t from as much code as possible.  Once (a) is done it will
get easier and will be possible to do piece-by-piece.
Right now the (a) (and, indeed, the unholy mess with copying kdev_t from
userland) is the worst problem.
