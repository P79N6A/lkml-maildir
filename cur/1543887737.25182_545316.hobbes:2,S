Christoph hasn't really _replaced_ any !KM_USER0 case with
KM_USER0 in this patch. AFAIR, we had originally decided to not
embed KM_USER0 in zero_user_page because of this complaint
from Anton Altaparmakov:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/10/62
But Christoph's patch here seems to have left that fs/ntfs/aops.c case
alone, and used the zero_xxx helpers only for KM_USER0 cases, so
we should probably be safe.

Wonder if any arch requires a valid mapping when doing the flush?
(reading Documentation/cachetlb.txt)
Documentation/cachetlb.txt is silent on whether flush_dcache_page()
really must be called before a kunmap(), but mentions that
flush_kernel_dcache_page() _must_ be called _before_ kunmap.
And I saw that parisc implements flush_dcache_page() using
flush_kernel_dcache_page itself (but then, we've not implemented a
meaningful kmap for parisc in the first place), so we've _just_
managed to be fine here ...
Still, flush_dcache_page() before kunmap'ing is an old practice,
would be wise to get this whetted by linux-arch first?
