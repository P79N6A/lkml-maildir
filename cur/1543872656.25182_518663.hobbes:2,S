Hello, again,
I just saw that my 0.28 patch file was wrongly named 0.26 and that there is a 
new version 0.29 of RSDL that just came out... so here is the backported RSDL 
0.29 to a 2.6.18.8 kernel.
This does compile but I did not got the time to fully test it yet.

Once again, thanx Con for this nice piece of code.
Also note that this patch already includes a few other patches from 2.6.19+ 
kernel and there might also be other small pieces of code comming from a 
2.6.19+ kernel:

Due to the project I'm currently working on, this will, in the next few
weeks, help me out comparing heavy loads on a Debian Sarge/Etch 32/64
platform.  Suggestions on benchmark tools would greatly be appreciated.
Again, duno if this will be helpfull for anybody... but who knows!
