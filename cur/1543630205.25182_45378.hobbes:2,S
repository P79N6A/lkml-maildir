All tests in chronological order, all today, all same volume ~320MB,
all same machines, source running 2.4.17-rc1aa1 since December 2001.
(Old values reported reflected situation in March 2002, a bit different)
2.4.19-pre3 vanilla
first time after boot 5m15s, then 1m56s 1m57s 1m56s 1m56s 1m57s
                      ^^^^^
2.4.19-pre4 vanilla
5m20s, then 4m00s 4m01s 4m00s 4m01s 4m01a
2.4.19-pre4-nfs-backout-cto, from pr8aa2, 2 Hunks
5m13a, then 1m57s 1m58s 1m57s 1m58s 1m59s
2.4.19-pre8 vanilla
5m05s, then 4m03s 5m20s(*) 6m00(*) 4m03s 5m02(*)
(*) heavy load on source machine
2.4.19-pre8aa2
8m58s, then 3m15s 3m17s 3m16s 3m15s 3m15s
^^^^^
2.4.19-pre8aa2-nfs-backout-cto, from pre8aa2, 5 Hunks
8m43s, then 5m12s 5m17s 5m16s, enough!
^^^^^
2.4.17-rc1aa1
2m46s, then 1m57s 1m56s 1m56s 1m56s, enough?
^^^^^
As long as the NFS problem persists,
all my machines (4) continue running 2.4.17-rc1aa1!
Stable, quick, reliable ... old, but nearly perfect.
Regards and many thanks
