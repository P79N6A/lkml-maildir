I see the point but... Take Linux as a community. Let's say someone
contributes stolen code, but the community doesn't check if the
contributed code violates any IP or copyright law. So, is the Linux
community guilty? Or else should the one that contributed code be
considered guilty?
We can't be liable for the work of others over which we don't have total
control. Or is the law forcing us to check line by line the
contributions made by hundreds of programmers all around the world?
