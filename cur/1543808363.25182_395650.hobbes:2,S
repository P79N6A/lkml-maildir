No, not at all!  I suspect there is possibly/probably a better way to  
do what the OP wants.  Also, the particular example of putting a  
pointer to a module function into the kernel core is quite racy and  
hard to get the locking/memory-barriers correct for, so a review of  
that part would probably be useful to the poster.

Oh of course not, but that's not what I was saying.  I just wanted to  
clarify that such deep linkage into the kernel implied that the full  
terms of the GPL applied to any distribution.

This is precisely why I asked the original poster to send a link to  
code (doesn't have to be the whole thing, but even just the pertinent  
snippets of the module code). You or I (or anybody else whose reading  
this thread) could easily help them verify their locking and pointer  
usage.
Cheers,
