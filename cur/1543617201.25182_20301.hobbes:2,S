With preempt it's "as soon as you hit a lock-break point".  They're equivalent,
for the inside-lock case, which is where most of the problems and complexity
lie.

I'd say the most obvious benefit of preempt is that it catches some
of the cases which the explicit schedules do not - the stuff which
the developer didn't test for, and which is outside locks.
How useful this is, is moot.
But we can *make* it useful.  I believe that internal preemption is
the foundation to improve 2.5 kernel latency.  But first we need
consensus that we *want* linux to be a low-latency kernel.
Do we have that?
If we do, then as I've said before, holding a lock for more than N milliseconds
becomes a bug to be fixed.  We can put tools in the hands of testers to
locate those bugs.  Easy.
