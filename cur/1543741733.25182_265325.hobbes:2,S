I have to apologize.  Shortly after sending off the earlier email message, 
I realized that the problem with sysfs pinning kobjects had already been 
fixed by taking a reference to the attribute's owner module.  The other 
problem can be handled by other means.  So my proposed change really is 
not needed.
Consider the patch revoked.
