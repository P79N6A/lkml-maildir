This should be totally irrelevant.  You shouldn't be able to
crash linux with dosemu unless you are doing direct hardware access.
There are a number of cases, where dosemu is different enough it has
been known to cause code to go down buggy non-common paths and cause
things to fail.  This has happened with both X and the kernel.
I suspect that is what is happening here.
Paul is dosemu configured to do any direct hardware access?
Also of interest is that this crash is not even directly triggered by
the dosemu process.  Instead an interrupt handler is doing something
bad.  
Paul If you can verify that dosemu isn't doing any direct hardware
access.  i.e. Dosemu isn't suid root, and you have no ports lines
you should be fine.
