How much allocated shm do you need to fill 800mbyte of normal zone with
the shm swap vector?
(btw, I suspect allocating one page at offset 4G in every shmfs file
could make the overhead per page of shm to increase)
But in real life I really don't expect problems here, one left page of
the vector holds 1024 swap entries, so the overhead is of the order of
1/1000. On the top of my head (without any precise calculation) 64G of
shm would generate stuff of the order of some houndred mbytes of ram
(please correct me if I'm wrong of course).  The malicious case of all
files with one page mapped at the very end, doesn't sounds realistic
scenario either. Comments?
