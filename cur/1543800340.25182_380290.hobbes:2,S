For two more datapoints, also from an x86_64 2.6.15-rc7 kernel, here
are the values for my main desktop .config and an allyesconfig .config.
The .deinline kernels have the above patch applied and are also built
with CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE=y.
$ size vmlinux.krw*
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
2338371  462208  479920 3280499  320e73 vmlinux.krw
2309384  468168  479920 3257472  31b480 vmlinux.krw.deinline
.text is only 1.24% smaller
For an allyesconfig, the results are slightly worse:
$ size vmlinux*
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
24076648        7465782 1996904 33539334        1ffc506 vmlinux
23791161        7513590 1996904 33301655        1fc2497 vmlinux.deinline
.text is only 1.19% smaller
