The reason I took the other approach is that I didn't want to introduce
an arbitrary delay into my startup.  I have varying speed machines
(ranging from P90 up to Athlon 1800) and wanted a solution consistent
across all of them.  I think that you can accomplish the delay startup
through initrd without a kernel change.
Delay solutions don't directly deal with the race between mounting and
detecting the USB device though.  If I select a value to small then I
still don't get a successful mount.
Maybe this isn't a major concern for this area of the kernel though... 
at this point there really aren't any other tasks so the delay should
have very consistent results.
Thanks,
