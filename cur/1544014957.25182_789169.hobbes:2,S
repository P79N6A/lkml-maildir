I'll ask ;) or set default to y. (because there is almost no overhead.)

I considered that at fist. I wrote this for 2 reasones.
 - Name of "debug" is no suitable for general use.
 - I wonder I can add some more debug support to debug cgroup like fault
   injection. For example,
   Add an create_may_fail file to debug cgroup.
   # echo 1 > debug.create_may_fail
   When create_may_fail is "1", debug->create() will fail at 50% of probability.
   (to make this test more useful, we should move debug_cgroup's subsys id to
    be more higher.)
   I'd like to add this kind of debug feature to debug cgroup when memcg is settled.
