Are you kidding me?
-Werror has been on for 5+ years under arch/sparc, and the tree in
those subdirectories always built warning free.
For crying out loud, Sam and I are asking for a few days to freshen
up these patches so they build properly.  What is the big deal?
The changes will go in, probably within the next week, just give us
a chance to fix them up.
I really can't believe what a big stink is being made in response
to an arch maintainer and one of his helpers wanting to clean up
a patch before it gets integrated.
