Mauro,
I've been out of town for the past few days... I just got home and saw this:

I don't think that this is 2.6.21 material.  These patches have not yet
received
enough testing to be sent to mainline.
I have tested them, and they seem to work for my cxusb device, but we have
yet to hear test results from users of usb dvb devices that do not use the
dvb-usb framework.  (ttusb, flexcop-usb, cinergyT2, for example)
The bug that these patches fix has been around throughout the entire kernel
history of the dvb subsystem.  The bug is not a regression -- it has
always been
there.  In my opinion, it is too late in 2.6.21 development to apply
this change.
Because these fixes are not obvious, I think we should let them get some
more testing, and have them queued for 2.6.22 .
Regards,
Michael
