> How does this look?
Ach - just a moment ago I submitted only that single
improvement, but you do the whole list.
(It is OK, of course. I looked for a second and concluded that
in all other cases the return value was in fact -ENOMEM, so that
no change was required. Only in the case of security_task_alloc()
is a different value, -EPERM, likely.)
Concerning style - I don't like
	if ((retval = copy_sighand(clone_flags, p)))
very much.
Where there is an if() one expects a boolean condition,
and in superficial reading one can easily mistake = for ==,
in spite of the additional parentheses.
Just
	retval = copy_sighand(clone_flags, p);
	if (retval)
is so much clearer.
