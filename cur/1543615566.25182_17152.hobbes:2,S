Hi,
Are these chipsets dangerous to use?
I found that other people reported similar problems to this one.
I have Asus ATV133-C motherboard, Duron 1000 MHz.
It does NOT have a Promise controller on board.
And I get such message, everytime after I reboot:
Jan  4 08:53:53 venus kernel: spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7.
My other hardware is OK: I putted everything from my previous Intel box.
In /proc/interrupts after 1:53 uptime I have:
ERR:        435
Here is what tells /proc/pci about chipset:
PCI devices found:
   Bus  0, device   0, function  0:
     Host bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT8363/8365 [KT133/KM133] (rev 3).
       Master Capable.  Latency=8.        Prefetchable 32 bit memory at 
0xe6000000 [0xe7ffffff].
   Bus  0, device   1, function  0:
     PCI bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT8363/8365 [KT133/KM133 AGP] (rev

       Master Capable.  No bursts.  Min Gnt=8.
   Bus  0, device   4, function  0:
