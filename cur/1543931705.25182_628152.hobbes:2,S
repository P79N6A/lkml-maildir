Hmm.. so, sysfs r/w buffer wasn't the culprit.  I'm curious what eats up
all your low memory.  Please do the following.
1. Right after boot, record /proc/meminfo and slabinfo.
2. After or near OOM, record /proc/meminfo and slabinfo.  This can be
tricky but if your machine reliably OOMs after 10mins, run it for 9mins
and capturing the result should show enough.
Thanks.
