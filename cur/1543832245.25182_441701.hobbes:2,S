 There you could find a more painful truth. You know what the real

True.
That's right.
In the past someone called it a lack of leadership...
But reading the references you introduced, I've first realized in how
deep problem we, the user community who want to use suspend-to-disk
and not suspend-to-ram, are.
It is so pity that the whole suspend (ram AND disk) process is not
addressed as a whole... Just because Linus does not care.
And if suspend-to-disk is more complex, it should be solved first,
since suspend-to-ram can be a subset of the process (Although people
in the past dismissed this claim... :( ).
So I guess we will continue to use suspend2 for a long while... Since
at least someone cares, and have a vision reacher than hay I can do
this in userspace.
