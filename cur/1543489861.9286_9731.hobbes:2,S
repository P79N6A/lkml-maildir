I thought about that infact. The only thing I can accpet here is to printk
a warning every time a sock packet is losing a frame. So doing the check
by hand and if it's ok recalling force_ and if it's not ok rejecting the
packet kprinting something.
I have to check but I think that the OOM is not an issue. If we slowdown
so much in tcpdump I think tbusy will be true before we'll have a way to
go OOM. I have to check though, so far this is only a guess.
