The reason why we do it as a lookup intent is because this has to be
atomic lookup+create+open in order to be at all useful to NFS.
Just doing create+open atomically is worthless since it leaves you with
a bunch of races where someone on the server can create, say, a symlink
between the RPC call to lookup and the RPC call that creates the file.

I'm going to fix this up.
