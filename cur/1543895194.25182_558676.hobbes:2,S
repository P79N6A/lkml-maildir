I claimed that.  Unless I missed something, Alexandre did not.
Ability to run on a standard PC is irrelevant.  Tivo distributes the
executable for the specific purpose of running on their hardware.
Having the signature accepted by the hardware is a critical aspect of
the executable.  That purpose and function are what make the signature
part of the work based on Linux.
Courts consider purpose and intent when analyzing actions; except when
one has bought the best available legal system, they would not follow
your logic.  (The role the signature plays in controlling access to a
copyrighted work, per DMCA, might also separately identify it as part
of the work based on Linux.)
If I wished to distribute a kernel with extended functionality from a
C file but not the C source files, under your logic I need not give
them out -- a user could modify the binary and run it on a general
purpose PC.  Right?  At most it would take clever linker tricks to
make the change small enough.
As to the suggestion that vendors would use another kernel: I would
not mind.  A huge fraction of the interesting and useful work in open
source kernels happens in Linux (first or only).  Using any third
party software is a trade-off of what you get versus what you give up.
