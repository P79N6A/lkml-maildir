Yes, I think this approach can support the various requirements
put on the scheduler.
I think there are two degrees of freedom that are needed in the
scheduler. One, as you say, for the sysadmin to be able to specify
what overall scheduler behavior he wants. 
Secondly, from the kernel standpoint, there needs to be perarch
hooks, to be able to utilize nodelevel/multilevel caches, NUMA
aspects etc.
