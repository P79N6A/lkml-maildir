I totally disagree.
Let's quickly review, this is illegal:
	local_irq_disable();
	{
		local_bh_disable();
		... do kfree_skb work ...
		local_bh_enable();
	}
	local_irq_enable();
as is this:
	local_irq_disable();
	{
		... queue to softirq TX work ...
	}
	local_irq_enable();
	... oops this won't make softirq TX work get run ...
The driver must therefore recognize that it may only free packets
in it's IRQ handler or in situations where BH protection has occurred
at a higher level or BH protection is the only protection it uses
from base context.
This is similar to how the driver must be aware that
netif_receive_skb() can cause it's ->hard_start_xmit() method to run
and therefore it must prevent deadlocks that might occur as a result
of locks held during the netif_receive_skb() call.
So let's fix the drivers. :)
