Presumably most of these places are actually trying to detect 
am-i-allowed-to-sleep.  Isn't that what in_atomic() is supposed to do?  
Why doesn't it do that in non-preemptible kernels?
For that matter, isn't it also the sort of thing that might_sleep() is 
supposed to check?  But looking at the definitions in 
include/linux/kernel.h, it appears that might_sleep() does nothing at 
all when neither CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY nor 
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP is set.
