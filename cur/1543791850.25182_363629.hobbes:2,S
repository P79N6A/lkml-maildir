The main reason it's taking so long is that it's
a background task for everyone working on it.
(Basically, me and one guy at NEC. ;-)
We've gotten sidetracked with lab setup issues
(signing a lease for office space, processing
paperwork for board donations, etc. etc.)
But I can run some tests now on a few different
platforms just on my desk.
I had hoped to have at least some preliminary
results by the end of November, with a bigger
call for help inside the forum to finish up
something big and professional-looking in April.
However, maybe I can cobble together some
things, and let people (both in and out of
the forum) look at the preliminary
results sooner.
I'll see what I can do by the end of November.
Thanks for the encouragement.
