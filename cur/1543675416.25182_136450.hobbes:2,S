Subject: [patch] 2.5.70-mm2: aha1740.c doesn't compile.

It seems the following compile error comes from Linus' tree:
<--  snip  -->
...
  CC      drivers/scsi/aha1740.o
...
drivers/scsi/aha1740.c:613: syntax error at end of input
...
make[2]: *** [drivers/scsi/aha1740.o] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
The culprit is the following bogus part of a patch (please _revert_ it):
