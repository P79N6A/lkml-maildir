I have tried to cat /dev/ttyS5 after
setserial /dev/ttyS5 port 0xd800 irq 11
[ I tried 0xd400 and 0xd800] and everything went to
cat: /dev/ttyS5: Input/output error
So, maybe this card is not 8250 compatible :-(
The card has one region of size 128:
	Region 1: I/O ports at d400 [size=128]
I think that it is EEPROM, because there is a driver for EEPROM on this PLX
chip somewhere on the Internet (I do not have that link here).

I think I started with hitting C-h a lot.  Really a LOT.
