Hi,
I'm currently experiencing some _bad_ problems with a 8390
card (NE2000 clone) and a dual Pentium machine (Intel Neptune).
If I stress the machine too much, the ethernet driver will
lose interrupts and is never able to recover the card. Only
a (hard?) reboot helps. 
This message appears in the logs (over and over and over...).
mirkwood kernel: eth0: Tx timed out, lost interrupt? TSR=0x3, ISR=0x3, t=1000.
And upon unloading + reloading the module I get this one:
mirkwood kernel: NE*000 ethercard probe at 0x300:<4>eth0: interrupt from stopped card
Is this a bug in the SMP-readiness of the NE driver or is it
simply a too flakey MB/card/driver combination?
regards,
Rik
