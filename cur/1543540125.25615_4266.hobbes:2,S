Hi all,
  I have big problem with this LVD controller. When I tried load kernel
module aic7xxx and nothing was connected to controller, everything was
fine. But when I had connected anythink (e.g. only cable with terminator),
module wasn't load successfully and system hang up. With
"verbose:0x1ffff" it wrote somethink like "PCI parity error". I have tried
changing PCI position, BIOS settings, termination. But nothink was
changed.
  I'v tried kernel 2.2.16 and 2.4.0-test4
Thanks for any information and/or ideas,
  Tonda Kral
