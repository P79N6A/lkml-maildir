Not true.  This is (IIRC) the _third_ flamewar during which a large  
proportion of the comments were either directly or indirectly one of  
the following: "You are intentionally breaking ndiswrapper", "What's  
wrong with having an 8k option?", and "This makes things more-fragile  
or isn't well tested".

To date, all of the above concerns have been addressed:
"You are intentionally breaking ndiswrapper":
    Yes, we know, and we don't care, because it's a bad solution and  
already broken. (12k windows stacks, preempt, etc).  If it matters to  
you, go fix it permanently (which I gather you are already trying to  
do, good work).
"What's wrong with having an 8k option?":
    It complicates the code, it means that bugs do not get reported  
because disabling 4k (or enabling 8k) fixes it, and this is the only  
excuse for the askers of the third question.  It also makes things  
more fragile because it means we need per-process order-1 allocations  
instead of order-0 allocations.  This option also makes crashes much  
harder to reproduce depending on interrupt load and a wide variety of  
other factors.  This means that _users_ may see no problem with an 8k  
option, but to the developers it's not such a great idea.
"This makes things more-fragile or isn't well tested.":
    Not true!  With the current situation in -mm, there are _0_  
unresolved 4k-stacks bugs.  If you have a problem, please report it  
so we can get it fixed.  However, since this does have technical  
advantages (see above), we want to _force_ this option _in_-mm_,  
*precisely* so we can get it better tested and work out the few  
remaining bugs.  Furthermore, this does *not* change the overall  
amount of stack!  8k == 4k + 4k!!!  It only makes stack overflows  
guaranteed and easy to debug in the specific call scenarios (instead  
of making them probabilistic and hard to reproduce).

Windows drivers like that using more than one thread are basically  
inherently racy under current Linux, and probably would not handle  
preemption at all.  If some mess like that breaks due to any in- 
kernel change, you get to keep all 42 pieces.

Great, you will probably make a lot of people happy with that.
