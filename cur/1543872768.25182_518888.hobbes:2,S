And here are the backported RSDL 0.30 patches in case any of you would still 
be running an older 2.6.18.8 kernel ...
Just for info, verison 0.30 seems around 2 seconds faster than 0.26-0.29 versions at boot time.  I used to have around 2-3 seconds of difference between a vanilla and a rsdl patched kernel.  Now it looks more like 5 seconds faster!  Wow.. nice work CK!
