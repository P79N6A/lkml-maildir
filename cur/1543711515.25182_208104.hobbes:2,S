thanks for the clarification.
At the moment I'm not sure anymore if this was non-ram or a
VM_FAULT_SIGBUS because I noticed I was doing BUG_ON(!pfn_valid)
_before_ checking new_page == VM_FAULT_SIGBUS. Though my theory about
do_no_page working fine with non-ram page_t with >=128m machines up to
2.6.4 still holds, and it's not obvious that Jens triggered a SIGBUS
either.
