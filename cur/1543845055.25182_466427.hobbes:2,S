Hello,
A PCI card, which developed in my company, isn't powered in a Hot Plug PCI 
slot(  Intel server ).
During boot-up, a populated slot powers up, then immediately powers off.
The card works fine in non Hot Plug slots. The Hot Plug PCI specification 
says that a regular PCI card should at least be powered in a Hot Plug PCI 
slot.
What are requirements for running a PCI card in a Hot Plug slot.
I would appreciate any help.
Igor
