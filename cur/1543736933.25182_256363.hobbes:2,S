is it the full modprobe latency trace, or just the header?  Putting zero
into trace_enabled wont disable the critical-section-timing code - it
only disables the function tracer. Since /proc/latency_trace takes the
header portion from the latency-timing code that might change. To
disable both do something like:
  echo 100000000 > /proc/sys/kernel/preempt_max_latency
  echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/trace_enabled
