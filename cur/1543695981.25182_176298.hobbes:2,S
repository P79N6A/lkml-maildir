Oops, yes.
The problem is that block and character devices put not a block number but 
a _device_ number in the place where other files put their block 
allocations.
Your patch is wrong, though - you shouldn't test for APPEND and IMMUTABLE 
here. That should be done at higher layers. 
I'd also prefer to do the test the other way around: test for CHRDEV and 
BLKDEV in inode.c the same way the other functions do. Something like the 
appended..
Al, can you verify? I think this crept in when you did the block lookup 
cleanups. I also worry whether anybody else got the bug?
