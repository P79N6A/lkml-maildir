I think the best thing would be to extend generic_file_write
(mm/filemap.c) to recognize if its writing a complete page to disk in
which case it will not duplicate that page.  (Issues with getting the
buffer cache to support this remain.)  This should make either the
mmap/write or sendfile aproach be zero-copy.  I am given the impression
that this is just what the TCP/IP version of write does to make it
zero-copy.
