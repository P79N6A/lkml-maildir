The default version of notifier chains should be the lockless version -
just like list_head, radix_tree, etc.  (idr tries to provide its own
locking and has turned out to be a classic case of why we shouldn't do
that).
And sure, it makes sense to provide additional, higher-level data
structures and APIs which layer on top of that, purely as a code
consolidation exercise.  But they shouldn't be called notifier_chains. 
Call them notifier_chain_mutex_locked and notifier_chain_rwlocked and
notifier_chain_spinlocked or whatever.
As for the NMIs and RCU: I suspect it was simply a mistake to try to use
notifier chains for NMI registration in the first place - they are simply
too complex a data structure for this.  I think I previously suggested
removing that code and using just a fixed-size array of function pointers. 
But if the RCUified notifier chain solution is less-than-totally-gross then
that might be OK as well.
