That's one part. Another - and I'll grant you it's an almost completely  
independent part - is having user level filesystems, both the full kind  
and (if the stream support gets done as mounts, like Al wants) as mini- 
filesystems.
Once both exist, tarfs (and ftpfs and many other things) is just a SMOP.
Incidentally, is there any *real* problem with the current VFS and user  
space filesystems, or is that a SMOP?
