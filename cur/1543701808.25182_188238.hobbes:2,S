Hello
I have a patch for scsi_scan.c to enable the proper scanning of tape
devices behind a Compaq fibre channel FCTC II tape controller.
I have tested this exhaustively using a Compaq FCTC and a Surestore DLT
80.
This patch should work for older versions of the 2.4 Kernel and version
2.6.
Thanks

Patch Notes:
This patch will allow the proper scanning and attachment of tape devices
which are located behind a Compaq F/C bridge FCTC II. If the firmware is
upgraded, the text will need to be changed to match accordingly as per
Model.
