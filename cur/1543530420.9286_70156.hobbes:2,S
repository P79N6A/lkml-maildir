Looking at the sources of do_brk(), it faults in the pages (thereby
assuring they will exist for the process) only if the process' VM is
locked (mlockall()).  Also, it returns with ENOMEM only[1] if
vm_enough_memory() says there isn't enough mem, but this function only
examines a snapshot of mem usage at the time of the call (and is
always successful if overcommit is set to on).
Unless I misunderstand the sources (I'm not a Linux VM expert), malloc
will overcommit.
[1] Well, not only, it also checks for rlimits and a few other things
    not related to real memory.
