Yep, you are right, but that is the easy issue to fix. There's hard
issue: I need 
struct rtc_device *rtc
for the rtc that can be used for system resume, and I'd like to get it
without violating too many layers. How to do that?
Ideally, I need 
set_alarm(int)
...that will magically pick the right rtc device to talk to, and set
alarm on it. I don't see how to implement it with current code.
