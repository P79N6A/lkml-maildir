Hello Detlef,
I had similar issues (I cannot remember the exact error messages, but it was ppp which complained about the compression/decompression errors).
I do not see those error messages when I use USB to Serial converter (it uses pl2303 driver) under heavy hard drive (IDE in my case) load. I guess USB sub-system is not as interrupts sensitive as Serial ports.
Thanks
Hari
