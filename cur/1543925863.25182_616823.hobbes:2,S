The oprofile module can setup a handler for PMU interrupts. This is done in 
archi/x86/oprofile/nmi_int:nmi_cpu_setup().  Other modules could do the same. 
However, it bumps what ever was using the nmi/pmu off, then restores nmi/pmu 
when oprofile is shut down. Maybe the pmu/nmi resource reservation mechanism 
should be another self-contained patch.

The per-thread monitoring is useful to a number of people and many people want 
it. The thought was how to break the large perfmon patch into set of smaller 
incremental patches. So it isn't whether to have per-thread pmu virtualization, 
but rather when/how to get it in.
