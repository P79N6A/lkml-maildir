I'm not disagreeing with the above, but what about performance?  Part of
the reason I suggested Netlink is that it's likely to be more efficient to
send messages over a socket than to exec a program for each key request
from the kernel.
It's difficult to know if performance will actually be an issue without
understanding the potential workload more.  What if many thousands of
clients are connected to a fileserver?  Would calling /sbin/request-key
for each key request be likely to cause performance problems?
