Think kernel service rather than daemon.  NFSd provides its own daemons to
override the security of, whereas cachefiles runs in the process context of
whoever called NFS.

That's more or less correct.  You have to add the pagefault handler to that
list.

Look in:
[PATCH 04/22] CRED: Request a credential record for a kernel service
Which was part of a patchset I sent on the 21st Sept.  get_kernel_cred() is in

[PATCH 13/22] CacheFiles: A cache that backs onto a mounted filesystem
