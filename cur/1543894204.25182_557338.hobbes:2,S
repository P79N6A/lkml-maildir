The planned scheme in btrfs involves storing the transaction id in the
header of every btree block, the inodes and the file extents.  So, the
only info you need to generate the incremental is the transaction id of
the last time you sync'd.  The tree would get walked and everything with
a higher transaction id sent down the pipe.
Since there have back pointers from inode to directory, it also be able
to generate a list of filenames that have changed, along with a list of
extents that were modified.
Between the two schemes, you would be able to do metadata aware (ie
storing exact duplicates) syncs between two boxes, or just have a faster
rsync that doesn't need to walk the directory structure to find changes.
I will probably code the rsync version first, just because it allows
you to backup to anything, not just a btrfs specific target.  It is
somewhat safer for an experimental FS (metadata errors are not
duplicated) and will hopefully be easier to code.

Stringing the replication together with the underlying FS would be neat.
Is there a way to deal with a master/slave setup, where the slave may be
out of date?
