It's desirable for /dev to contain subdirectories rather than having
everything lumped into the top-level directory. It makes it easier to
see what you have and also makes things easier to manage.
I can't remember who chose /dev/vc/ in this particular case, but the
principle of moving things into subdirectories is fully supported by
Linus. In fact, he wanted me to go further than I had :-)
