Yeah, it's all my fault, what else is new...
Anyway, no, my change to the uhci (and ohci and ehci drivers) is ok,
it's just that pci_register_driver() is incorrect :)
Here's a fix for it, that lets the USB host controllers work properly.
Now PCI works like the other bus drivers.  As we had no idea of how many
devices bound to the driver, this function was just lying and returning
"1".  What a stinker.
I'll add this to my trees, and I've gone through and audited all callers
of this function to now work properly (there were some pretty strange
ideas of what to do on an error returned from this function...)
Alan, these error messages lead me to believe that the error recovery
code in the uhci driver doesn't quite work properly, as even if the
register of the pci driver fails, we shouldn't error out with this mess,
right?
thanks,
greg k-h
