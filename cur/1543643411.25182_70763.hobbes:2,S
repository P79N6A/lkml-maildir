1000 times per second, enter timer interrupt, acknowledge it, exit
interrupt. Few i/o accessess, few tlb entries kicked out, some L1
cache consumed?
Is 10usec per timer interrupt reasonable on modern system? That's 10
msec per second spend in timer with HZ=1000, thats 1% overall. So it
seems to me it is possible for HZ=1000 to have performance impact...
