I think you're not exactly understanding what a reiser4 "plugin" is.
Currently plugins are not modules. It just means that there's a defined
interface between the reiser4 core and the plugins. Just like you could
see filesystems as "VFS plugins".
In fact, reiser4 plugins are
- users of the reiser4 core API
- some of them are implementing Linux VFS methods (thus being some sort
of glue code between the Reiser4 storage tree and the Linux VFS)
