Brief description of the machine:
SMP - pII-333 from same batch
256mb ram
6 - 36gb scsi u2w
2 - 9gb scsi u2w
dpt 3ch i2o
intel eepro100
Hrm This is probably not a bug but sure seems strange to me:
After doing some load tests with apache (transparent proxy redirects
80->8080) i came back to my login session to find that when I would run
almost any command it would Sefault and/or core dump. ls/cd/cat/tail 
worked, but ls -l would not work. I can still get webpages with static
content but the cgi's wont run... any ideas on what causes this?
Any help is greatly appreciated.
