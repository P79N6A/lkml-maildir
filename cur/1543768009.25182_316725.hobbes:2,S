Well, the lack of semicolon is wrong really (and funny).
But is the whole while loop needed at all?  deflate()
consumes as much input as it can, producing as much output
as it can.  So without the loop, and without updating the
buffer pointers ({next,avail}_{in,out}) it will do just
fine without the loop, and will return something != Z_OK
on next iteration.  If this is to mean to flush output,
it should be deflate(&stream, Z_FLUSH) or something.

P.S.  What's git@vger.kernel.org for ?
