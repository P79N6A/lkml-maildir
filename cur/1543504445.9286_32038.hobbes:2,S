Subject: CLONE_PPID support for LinuxThreads

I have modified LinuxThreads to support Tim Hockin's CLONE_PPID kernel
patch. The aim is to make the cost of a pthread_create() approach the
cost of a clone(). In existing LinuxThreads, pthread_create() is many
times more expensive due to a context switch to the manager thread,
which does the clone to actually create the thread, and another
context switch back to the thread that called pthread_create(). With
CLONE_PPID the thread calling pthread_create() can do the clone()
directly. On my dual PPro-200 machine this reduces the cost of a
pthread_create() from about 23000 cycles to about 11000 cycles.
My patch is against glibc/linuxthreads-2.1.1 (actually against
RedHat's glibc-2.1.1-6, but they should apply to vanilla
glibc-2.1.[12] also). Currently the patch only includes support for
x86.  You can download it at
<URL:
http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~dpw/linux/glibc-2.1.1-ppid.patch>.
 I
have also put a recent version of Tim's kernel patch at
<URL:
http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~dpw/linux/linux-2.2.10-ppid.patch>
Once you have rebuilt glibc with the patch, the easiest way to test
the changes is to place the libc and libpthread binaries into a
directory and set LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that your existing LinuxThreads
program will use them. I have put a tar files containing prebuilt
libraries at
<URL:
http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~dpw/linux/ppid-libs-0.1.i386.tar.gz>
(these are from RedHat's glibc-2.1.1-6, with my patch added).
Any feedback will be gratefully received, but I'm away on vacation for
a week from today so it might take me a while to get back to you.
Regards,
David Wragg
