this is exactly the type of thing that I think is acceptable.
this is a case of a new client needing a new host.
if you have a server running a bunch of 2.4 UMLs on a 2.4 host and want to add 
a 2.6 UML you can do it becouse you can shift to a buch of 2.4 UMLs (plus one 
2.6 UML) running on a 2.6 host.
what I would be bothered by was if you weren't able to run a 2.4 UML on a 2.6 
host becouse you have locked out the upgrade path
Everyone needs to remember that this sort of thing does happen, Xen2 clients 
cannot run on a Xen3 host.
