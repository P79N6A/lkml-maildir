I think doing calls to the USB interrupt handler would work.
I'm not being crazy :)
But yeah we could do a micro-stack as well, but as you noted the
transfer to/from the real USB HCI driver would be non-trivial.
I truly believe just calling the real USB HCI driver interrupt
handler in a polling fashion is the way to go.
