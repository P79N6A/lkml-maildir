Nothing prevents it ? well, I wouldn't be that optimistic :) The USB
stuff is a bit complex, it inlcudes doing DMAs, so manipulating the
iommu, dealing with URB queues (and thus allocating/releasing them)
etc... and especially in the context of xmon, that mean letting the
driver do a lot of these at any time whatever state the system is...
So it's possible, but will probably be difficult and not very reliable.
An alternative is to take over the OHCI chip completely and implement a
micro-stack that only does interrupt pipe polling and hard decodes kbd
data based on a standard boot protocol layout... Handing the controller
back to normal USB operations may prove a bit difficult here though.
