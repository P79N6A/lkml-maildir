well, it's a borderline situation and a nuance, and i think we agree on 
the two (much more common) boundary conditions:
 1) line fits into 80 cols - in that case we keep it all on a single line
    (this is the ideal case)
 2) line does not fit on two lines either - in that case we do the style
    that you used above.
On the boundary there's a special case though, and i tend to prefer:
 +static inline void
 +slqb_stat_inc(struct kmem_cache_list *list, enum stat_item si)
over:
 -static inline void slqb_stat_inc(struct kmem_cache_list *list,
 -				enum stat_item si)
for two reasons:
 1) the line break is not just arbitrarily in the middle of the 
    enumeration of arguments - it is right after function return type.
 2) the arguments fit on a single line - and often one wants to know that 
    signature. (return values are usually a separate thought)
 3) the return type stands out much better.
But again ... this is a nuance.

the moment this 'boundary style' "overflows", it falls back to the 'lots 
of lines' case, where we generally put the function return type and the 
function name on the first line.

there are a handful of cases where the return type (and the function 
attributes) are _really_ long - in this case it really helps to have them 
decoupled from the arguments.
