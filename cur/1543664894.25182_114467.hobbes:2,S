I can't really help much but here is a quick interpretation, this is your 
card with all the irqs wired to PIN A which seems to correspond with what 
Donald Becker said.
 INT     active-lo       level        3   4:A          4    0
 INT     active-lo       level        3   5:A          4    0
 INT     active-lo       level        3   6:A          4    0
 INT     active-lo       level        3   7:A          4    0
IO-APIC (apicid-pin) 2-0,  <-- doesn't that actually mean pin0 on the 
ioapic servicing that card is not connected? (or due to mptables again)
