Says 
http://www.eff.org/bernstein/19990507_eff_pressrel.html
:
   EFF anticipates
   that the government will ask for a stay of this ruling pending appeal.
   If granted, the stay would prohibit encryption exports even within the
   Ninth Circuit's jurisdiction, including all federal courts in
   California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, Montana, Idaho, Nevada,
   Alaska, Hawaii, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, until the
   matter is finally resolved.
The last I heard, France
(
http://www.asi.fr/~martinez/crypto/project/FINAL.html#_Toc415913699
) and
Russia had restrictions on the use of cryptography, and also the Wassenaar
Arrangement (
http://www.fitug.de/news/wa/Cat5P2.html
) might become a
problem for free software
(
