That is error-prone. Not "==FALSE" but what happens if x is (for some 
reason) not 1 and then "if (x==TRUE)". There has been suggestions of doing:
if (x != FALSE)
or
if (!x == !TRUE)
but a simple "if (x)" is (in my opinion) the correct way.
Then that there is some objections booleans not being the "classical 
C"-way, is another story.
