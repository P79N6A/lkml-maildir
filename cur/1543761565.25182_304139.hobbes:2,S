I did the same quick latency tests with 2.6.12-rc1 that I posted about
for 2.6.11 a few weeks ago.
2.6.12-rc1 is significantly better than 2.6.11.  Running JACK at 64
frames (1.3 ms) works very well.  I was not able to produce xruns even
with "dbench 64", which slows the system to a crawl.  With 2.6.11, I
could easily produce xruns with much lighter loads.
It would appear that the latency issues related to the 4 level page
tables merge have been resolved.
