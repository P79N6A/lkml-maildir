Sorry about this. It really couldn't be helped as I've been on the road
a lot lately. I was even in the audience for your talk at CELF ;)

Summary of changes re V3 comments :-
 o Added lots of documentation.
 o Added ABI documentation.
 o Changed debug option Kconfig style.
 o Regulator no longer a class device.
 o sysfs naming changes, ie. now uses microvolts and microamps.
 o sysfs entries only export one value.
 o get_current() macro undef removed.
 o set_voltage(), set_current_limit() now take a lower and upper
acceptable value.
 o Fixed a locking issue.
 o Made 'compiled out' interface all static inline instead of macros.
 o Removed dynamic voltage control where the voltage would be
dynamically managed to be the lowest for all consumers (no known users
of this code atm - although spoke with someone at CELF who was
interested in this feature for the future).
 o Checkpatch fixes.
 o Removed comments describing some functions from the headers - now all
such comments are in the c files.

Yes. Other additions :-
 o Test harness added to aid developers with testing regulator drivers
(virtual.c - patch 07/13).
 o Support for fixed output regulators. i.e. regulators that cannot be
controlled by software but coexist on systems with software controllable
regulators (fixed.h, fixed.c - patches 04/13 and 06/13)
 o Bulk operations for consumers that may have multiple regulator
supplies (consumer.h, core.c - patches 01/13 and 05/13)
 o Changed core file and header names to be more meaningful. i.e
reg-core.c -> core.c, regulator/regulator.h -> regulator/consumer.h,
etc.
Lastly, I've forgotten the MAINTAINERS patch but this can be added
later.
