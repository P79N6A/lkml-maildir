It is a not exactly the same issue as the pata_{legacy,qdi,winbond} one
discussed above.  Anyway cool to see another IDE -> libata regression fixed.

Hmm, this doesn't seem to be a problem w.r.t. to the patch we are discussing
because in such case ata_id_major_version() will just return 0 and the check
will behave in the identical way as it was before the patch.

Sure, we can always improve things further later.  However Mario's patch
is _definitely_ an improvement over the _current_ code.  Don't you agree?
[ There are no alternative patches to consider currently so... ]
