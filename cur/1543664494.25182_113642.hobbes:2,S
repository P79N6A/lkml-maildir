I think he's allowed to use the name so long as he only uses it to
describe what the purpose of the tool is and recognizes in the same
document who the holder of the trademark is. Just the same as someone
can write an article about Windows and Microsoft, or a software product
can claim that it runs under Windows or MacOS.
He's allowed to say "This tool allows you to access a BitKeeper
repository".
