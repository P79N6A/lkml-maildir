Reality disagrees. There are already several cases where notifications 
are sent via the keyboard controller, such as the wireless and touchpad 
disable keys on my HP. There are Dells that do the same for brightness 
keys. Unless you want to make the argument that sending keyboard 
controller events through the input layer is the wrong thing to do, it's 
impossible to standardise on a setup where we never see notifications 
through it.
