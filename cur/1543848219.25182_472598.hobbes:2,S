Sure seems like a compiler bug to me.  For over two decades, casting
a value into the void has been a standard idiom for saying "ignore
that value" ... ISTR using it to get rid of "unused value" warnings
with LINT on BSD 4.1 systems.
Does anyone know why the GCC folk have decided to go against decades
of common practice here???
