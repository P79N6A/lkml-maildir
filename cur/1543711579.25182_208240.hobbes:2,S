# Sorry for asking the same question.
# This time, this is a simplified one.
Hello,
I need to use two writable partitions now.
 /                a read-only fs
 /foo/data        a writable fs
 /bar/data        a writable fs
The root partition needs to be read-only to avoid
tampering.
These writable partitions need to be separated, for
I use 'chroot /foo' and 'chroot /bar'.
But, I want to merge them like this.
 /                a read-only fs
 /.data           a writable fs
 /foo/data        a mount point to bind with /.data/foo
 /bar/data        a mount point to bind with /.data/bar
To do so, I use 'mount --bind' like this.
mount --bind /.data/foo    /foo/data
mount --bind /.data/bar    /bar/data
Now, I want to know whether /foo/data and /bar/data are
separated. That is, a process (whose root is /)
can access /.data/foo by resolving /foo/data, and
can't access /.data/bar by resolving /foo/data/../bar .
