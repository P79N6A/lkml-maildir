I think the adaptec 1200A is just another low-cost
not-quite-hardware-raid controller. As far as I have heared it is based
on Highpoint-Tech's HPT370. There is raid-0 support implemented in the
kernel.
be sure to enable CONFIG_BLK_DEV_ATARAID_HPT=y
The volumes should show up as /dev/ataraid/d[0-9]p[0-9] (major
blockdevice number 114).
