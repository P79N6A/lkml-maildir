Why should this be required?
How about:
mark directory busy
	unhash dentry
		change dentry
	rehash dentry
	update directory info
unmark directory as busy
?
The worse that I can see happening here is that someone is reading
from the dentry while this happens, and gets some third (but logically
equivalent) version of the name.
But maybe there's some access path I've not considered?
