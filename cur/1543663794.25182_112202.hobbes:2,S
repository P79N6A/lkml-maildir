It gets called after device_unregister() is called on the pci device,
through the driver core, and is actually done in the pci_device_remove()
function in driver/pci/pci-driver.c
Hm, I just realized that the pci hotplug drivers were calling the remove
function twice (once on their own, and then through sysfs), this patch
will fix that.

It shouldn't be that tough to convert the Compaq and IBM drivers, I'll
work on it tonight and test on hardware tomorrow.
