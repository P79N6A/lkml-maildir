I'm withdrawing this one. At boot, it wasn't controlling the fans, but
after a suspend-resume it started up fine. My subsequent boots have
also been okay, so I'm at a loss to explain what I saw.
Regardless, given that it's hard to reproduce, I have no evidence that
it's a regression, it could just be something that's really rare.
Thanks,
Ray
