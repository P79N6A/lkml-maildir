I complained about this very issue when a previous version of
this patch was submitted last week, and Arnd explained that
non-x86 doesn't have a problem here because alignof(u64) is the
same in 32- and 64-bit modes.
However, the fact that the patch description talks about 32-
and 64-bit machines _in_general_, while the patch clearly only
handles x86-32 on x86-64 and ia64, is itself a bug. A more
precise patch description and a better comment in the code
is in order, I think.
