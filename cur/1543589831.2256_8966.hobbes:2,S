Well, OK. No unmodified 32-bit system runs HZ == 1024.

Yes.

Not a problem. Note that I count bit flips, not roll overs.
Here are the two variables, with "flips" lagging a bit:
flips  jiffies
0      0x7fffff26
0      0x80000003   (not noticed yet)
1      0x8000b01a
1      0xffffffe7
1      0x00000666   (not noticed yet)
2      0x0000ee15
Calculate 64-bit (well, 63-bit) jiffies as:
long long total;
unsigned f = flips;
unsigned j = jiffies;
f += (f ^ (j>>31)) & 1;
total = ((long long)f<<31) | j;
Now print the total.
Well, there it is. Like it? The /proc reader does 64-bit operations
and a timer goes off every few days, saving the clock tick from
doing any 64-bit operations. The fast path stays fast, while procps
can get useful data even after years of uptime.
