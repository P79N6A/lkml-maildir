This "guiding principle" appears to be the primary reason why
we've taken over a year to stabilise linux 2.0 and linux 2.2
and linux 2.4 ... or at least, too much of a focus on the first
half of this guiding principle. ;)
We absolutely have to take care in avoiding the worst case
scenarios, since statistics pretty much guarantee that somebody
will run into nothing but that scenario ...
cheers,
Rik
