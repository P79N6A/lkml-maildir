Subject: Re: How do I remove the files with the following characteristics?
first, get the most recent version of e2fs tools, 1.18 or higher, boot/init
to single user mode with the filesystem mounted read only and all buffers
flushed.
run e2fsck on the partition.  this should correct some of these files to
save you some finger work.
next, run debugfs on this partition, you'll need to spend a goodly amount of
time reading the man page so you are familiar with how it operates.
you -must- read the man page to find out what option you need to write to
the drive.  i will not tell it.
in debugfs, cd to the mangled directory
(have a list of the directory handy as you are going through it)
follow these next steps in repetitive sequence
1) debugfs: mi <file>                           (modify inode)
                         Mode   [nnnnnnn]  _
2) type in 01000644 where the cursor is positioned, hit enter.
3) continue hitting enter until you reach the debugfs: prompt again
4) return to step #1 until all mangled files have been modified
5) debugfs: write                               (write the changes to disk)
6) debugfs: quit
now run sync a couple of times, i also recommend ALT-PRSC-S (magic key
sequence in kernel to sync) if you have it compiled in the kernel.  if you
don't, wait half a minute, then mount the filesystem readwrite and go into
that directory and do as you wish with the files.  probably rm.
after rming the files, unmount the filesystem and run e2fsck on it again
until it comes up clean.
