   Well, you're close. :-)

   This is not enough for PIO mode 1, as this only gives 150 ns active +

   You can actually skip "pio > 2" test.

   There's no need to use such complex math when the chip only supports 
UltraDMA modes 0 thru 2. Be simple:
		u_speed = udma << (drive->dn * 4);

   We dropped support for SWDMA, so the check  should not be needed...

   ... and *else* branch is pointless.

   Well, not the best place in the PIIX driver -- DMA modes shouldn't 
affect prefetch and IORDY settings (regardless of what the Intel's 
programming manuals say :-).
Àlthough, it's probably OK to continue abusing the set_pio_mode() method.
