And if you'll call something that will throw an exception here it will
compile to? BTW, there are many places where you
	* release the lock on different pathes.
	* don't want to hold it too long.
	* release it from another function, called by you.
	* have to release a spinlock before the blocking operation.
	* have scopes incompatible with syntax ones, e.g
		if (!wee) unlock(&hop);
		lock(&foo);
		while(bar()) {
			if (baz()<0) {
				barf();
				if (wee) unlock(&hop);
				unlock(&foo);
				return;
			}
			unlock(&foo);
			quux();
			lock(&foo);
			fred();
		}
		barf();
		unlock(&foo);
Again, C++ issues aside, you can't do it by magic. You have to store the
information re: what is hold.
