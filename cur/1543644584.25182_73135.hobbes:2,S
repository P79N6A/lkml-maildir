It's a question of which errors one wishes to handle, and which you
simply choose to ignore.
It's a compromise, and I understand that.
For example, BK uses checksums on all it's files (AFAIK).  This allows
you to at least discover hardware errors.  CVS doesn't - but CVS is
still "good enough" for a lot of people.
Some hardware problems cannot be detected, much less recovered from,
without adding some significant cost (run-time performance wise,
complexity wise, or ...).
This problem, however, you can both detect and recover from perfectly,
with little extra effort.  Whether you want to do so or not is of course
up to you.
I'm not going to push - I just wanted to point it out  :)

Assuming your 20 bytes do not span a 128 byte boundary  ;)
Perhaps you're safe on current LVM/RAID/partition layers (which may
guarantee a coarser alignment - today).
And perhaps there is no disk out there with less than 128 byte atomic
writes.  Maybe.   Do you know?  I certanly don't.

Please read the original mails about the IDE disk writing.
The date is 5th of August this year, the subject was "Disk (block) write
strangeness".
The conclusion really was that there is no such thing as a 512 byte
sector.  Not in the real world.  The disk interface may emulate it, but
that doesn't mean that the disk is internally working with a concept
even remotely close to that.

I was pretty surprised about all this myself, and I just wanted to bring
the issue to your attention.
The real world just sucks sometimes  ;)

Of course - I look forward to seeing how/if you will deal with the
problem.
