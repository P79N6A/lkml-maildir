Subject: [PATCH 2/2] RFC: Fix futex_lock_pi fault handling (NOT FOR INCLUSION)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/9/46

Regardless of whether we call get_user or futex_handle_fault to deal with a
fault, the uaddr doesn't change, so the key won't change.  There doesn't appear
to be a reason to re-get the key after a get_user call, but not after a
futex_handle_fault.  This patch moves both jump points to right after the the
get_futex_key call.  Also fix a missed put_futex_key() call and update the
comment to accurately depict the current code (we don't hold the mm sem now).
