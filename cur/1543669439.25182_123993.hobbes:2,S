It is because old3 is only referenced if:
 ((data->type != w83781d) && data->type != as99127f)
as those two chips don't have extended divisor bits ...
It is however set in the first occurrence:
       /* w83781d and as99127f don't have extended divisor bits */
       if ((data->type != w83781d) && data->type != as99127f) {
               old3 = w83781d_read_value(client, W83781D_REG_VBAT);
       }
and thus is rather gcc being brain dead for not being able to figure
old3 is only used within a if block like that.
I was not sure about style policy in a case like this, so I left it as
is, it should however be possible to 'fix' it with:
