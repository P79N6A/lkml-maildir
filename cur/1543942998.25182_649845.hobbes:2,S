I actually care about Linux certainly more than you do. I care about the
copyright of my kernel contributions and the contributions of others.
Not caring about these things is what is the worst. It means you
disrespect all the work that a lot of people and companies have put into
Linux.
And don't quote we with "I don't care". Alan already complained about
your quoting style. Don't put words in my mouth that I never said.
The Linux kernel is licensed under GPL. If you don't like, go and play
with someone else. You can quote me on that one.
Regards
Marcel
