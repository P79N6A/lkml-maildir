Hi,
I recently bought a IBM DTTA 351010 (10 GB) EIDE/ATA disk, capable of UDMA2,
because I just needed space (eveything else is SCSI) and am just about
broke. :(
Various tests describe this thing as fast (~6.5 MB/sec), and it is the only
IDE device I have in my machine, but hdparm only tells me 2.5MB/sec (my
DCAS-34330W does 5.8MB/sec according to hdparm, and ~4MB/sec according to
magazines).
Where can I tune, except for "hda=autotune,dma" (tried that)?
