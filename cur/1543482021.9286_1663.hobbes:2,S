I'm using simple two loops in different kernel trees:
      while true; do make clean; make MAKE='make -j10'; done
which leads into load upper 30.  You can see a great performance upto
load to 25 ... 30+ *and* a brutal break down of that performance
at this point.  The system is a PentiumII 400MHz with 32, 64, 128MB
(mem=xxx) and SCSI only.  In comparision to 2.0.36 the performance
is *beside of this break down* much better ...  that means that only
the performance break down at high load is the real problem.

What's about a `PG_recently_swapped_in' bit for pages which arn't found
anymore with the swap cache?  This isn't a prediction but a protection
against throwing out the same page in the following cycle.
