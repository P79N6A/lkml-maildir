    Solved it for me, although running SMP on a old slow PentiumII feels a 
    tad odd. Other than that the system is running very well, I have to try 
    a response test and see how it feels then.
Oh I agree, the right patch is not to run SMP, but it *is* a workaround. This
patch against rc3-mm1 should let you run it UP:
