Yes.  Well, this just strengthens the case for getting PCMCIA support
migrated fully into the kernel tree so that we can pry people's finger
loose from pcmcia_cs.  David Woodhouse is planning to take up this
project early in the 2.5 development cycle.
It's kind of a shame that more testing of the 2.4.x Cardbus/PCMCIA 
drivers isn't happening, because a lot of the Cardbus/PCMCIA support
in the kernel tree is really just fine.  We should all be using it and
testing it and reporting bugs.
One of the work items will be getting the in-kernel PCMCIA support
to work with the new hotplug stuff.
