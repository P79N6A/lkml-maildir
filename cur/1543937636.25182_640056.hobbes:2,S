Lets see the device_move function, seems there's some problems in it:
1302 int device_move(struct device *dev, struct device *new_parent)
1303 {
1304         int error;
1305         struct device *old_parent;
1306         struct kobject *new_parent_kobj;
1307
1308         dev = get_device(dev);
1309         if (!dev)
1310                 return -EINVAL;
1311
1312         new_parent = get_device(new_parent);
1313         new_parent_kobj = get_device_parent (dev, new_parent);
Here could get kobject reference
1314         if (IS_ERR(new_parent_kobj)) {
1315                 error = PTR_ERR(new_parent_kobj);
1316                 put_device(new_parent);
1317                 goto out;
1318         }
1319         pr_debug("DEVICE: moving '%s' to '%s'\n", dev->bus_id,
1320                  new_parent ? new_parent->bus_id : "<NULL>");
1321         error = kobject_move(&dev->kobj, new_parent_kobj);
1322         if (error) {
1323                 put_device(new_parent);
imagine new_parent is NULL, then the new_parent_kobj should be put
1324                 goto out;
1325         }
1326         old_parent = dev->parent;
1327         dev->parent = new_parent;
1328         if (old_parent)
1329                 klist_remove(&dev->knode_parent);
1330         if (new_parent)
1331                 klist_add_tail(&dev->knode_parent,
&new_parent->klist_children);
1332         if (!dev->class)
1333                 goto out_put;
Why not put new_parent | new_parent_kobj?
1334         error = device_move_class_links(dev, old_parent, new_parent);
1335         if (error) {
1336                 /* We ignore errors on cleanup since we're hosed
anyway... */
1337                 device_move_class_links(dev, new_parent, old_parent);
1338                 if (!kobject_move(&dev->kobj, &old_parent->kobj)) {
1339                         if (new_parent)
1340                                 klist_remove(&dev->knode_parent);
1341                         if (old_parent)
1342                                 klist_add_tail(&dev->knode_parent,
1343
&old_parent->klist_children);
1344                 }
1345                 put_device(new_parent);
Same doubt as above
1346                 goto out;
1347         }
1348 out_put:
1349         put_device(old_parent);
1350 out:
1351         put_device(dev);
1352         return error;
1353 }
Hope I'm wrong, but if it's indeed bugs, I will send a patch about this.
