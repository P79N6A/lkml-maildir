Please see this URL:
http://lxr.linux.no/source/include/asm-i386/mach-default/do_timer.h#L20
static inline void do_timer_interrupt_hook(struct pt_regs *regs)
{
        do_timer(regs);
#ifndef CONFIG_SMP
        update_process_times(user_mode(regs));
#endif
/*
 * In the SMP case we use the local APIC timer interrupt to do the
 * profiling, except when we simulate SMP mode on a uniprocessor
 * system, in that case we have to call the local interrupt handler.
 */
#ifndef CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC
        profile_tick(CPU_PROFILING, regs);
#else
        if (!using_apic_timer)
                smp_local_timer_interrupt(regs);
#endif
}
That is the code in 2.6.12, but 2.6.13.3 also same with it at least.
So we call scheduler_tick() HZ times per second, both enable
SMP or disable it.
Nod, I agree with your words, the scheduler_tick() do not same with
timer interrupt handler on call times. but I guess it should be more
than jiffies, beacause of other functions also can call it (for example,
as Lateef said, sched_fork().)
I think that
scheduler_tick() might be called from somewhere
is not exact.
We may note, it do not be EXPORT_SYMBOL_*()ed , so it only can be called 
from kernel core,
not kernel modules. Such a few places we can find it use LXR or grep.
I use setup one sysctl integer variable to watch the value of 'count_tick',
Do this way have any problem? I found some value skips, but I think it is
normal case.
However, I will make a experiemnt that write one hook like do_timer(), 
as Love said
PS: if our scheduler_tick() is not called every timer interrput, the 
compute of task timeslice
also is not exact ?!
Thanks a lot.
