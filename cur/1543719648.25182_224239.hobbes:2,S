Next try:
the attached patch fixes the EDID parsing for PPC on rivafb. It actually
finds the EDID info in the OF Tree now. I grabbed this from BenHs Tree as
of 2.6.5-rc3. The current code has no chance to work since it doesn't
walk the device tree.
This helps rivafb on PPC at least a bit further...
