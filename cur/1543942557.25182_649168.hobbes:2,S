Subject: [PATCH], issue EOI to APIC prior to calling crash_kexec in die_nmi path

Hey all-
	A hang on kdump was reported to me awhile back, only when systems died
via nmi watchdog panic.  The hang wouldn't always be in the same place, but it
would usually be somewhere down in purgatory.  In looking at the code, it
occured to me that since, during an nmi interrupt, we won't be able to handle
additional interrupts, that we won't be able to halt the other processors on a
system like we try to do in machine_crash_shutdown.  As such, it appears that
leaving the other cpus running exposes us to the risk that another processor
will encounter an error and halt the system while we are trying to boot the
kdump kernel, and that can result in a hang.  I wrote the attached patch to end
the nmi interrupt prior to calling crash_kexec from within die_nmi, and testing
here has proven successfull.
Regards
Neil
