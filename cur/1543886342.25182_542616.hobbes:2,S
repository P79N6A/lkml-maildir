As I previously asked, could you tell me what is the last version that is
known to work with this config ?
Also, is it possible for you to capture the oops and decode it, or even
easier, please send me your kernel and initrd so that I can quickly boot
it on another machine and see how it behaves.
If it is a config problem, we must understand it and see what we can do to
avoid people get trapped by it again, and if it's a bug, we must fix it.
Regards,
Willy
