I have to nack this one for now, I still want the generic command types
patch to go in first. We have far too many queue hooks already, adding
two more for a relatively obscure use such as this one is not a good
idea.
My suggestion is to maintain this patch out of tree for now, it will be
a few kernel release iterations before the command type patch is in.
