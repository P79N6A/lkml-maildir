It is allowed to use special buffers for prefetch, but --- because 
prefetch doesn't change program semantics, these special buffers must be 
kept consistent just like caches --- they must be snooped for bus 
transactions and they must be checked each time something writes to cache.
So I doubt anyone will ever implement it this way --- it's too much 
silicon for too little effect.
