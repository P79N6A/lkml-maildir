Ask BugTrax about that - of the unices I've met, those that honour
S[UG]ID bits on scripts are the ones that have the most security
holes, and I believe the two facts are connected.

Turn that round: If it CAN do the same, then it's a serious security
risk that should be closed up.

No "all capable" interpreter should exist for the simple reason that
having either it or a script with EXTRA capabilities is a serious
security risk that needs to be closed up.
