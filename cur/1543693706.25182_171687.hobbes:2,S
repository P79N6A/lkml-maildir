     In the kernel logic, VM mechanics are really orthogonal to the CPU.
But, in the real world, someone, like hardware maintenance person,
should treat CPUs and memory at a time to maintain Unit. So, notion
of Unit should be somewhere, might be sysfs + userland.

    "Forcible" way is not a good idea.
In that mean, it should be a "cooperative" way with kernel, userland,
and sometimes with system operator who can make an appropriate
environment.

I think the way using "ZONE_HIGHTMEM" simplify the issues to
be able to remove physical arena other than kernel memory
allocated one that would be fixed.

    Could tell me what is the real issue you think?
