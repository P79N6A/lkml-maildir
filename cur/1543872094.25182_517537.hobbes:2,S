I'd suggest you commit all your changes in local branches, then export 
them as emails via git-format-patch for posting.
Something like:
 davem-upstream         [1]
  +- for-davem          [2]
     +- for-davem-prep  [3]
Do all of your work in [3], so you can manage the queue of patches there 
before merging/applying them into [2] as a final patch series.
So, if one of the commits in [3] needs fixing, you can, for example, 
export commits up to that with git-format-patch, git-reset --hard to the 
broken commit, fix, compile, test then reapply the exported commits.  
Then, once it's all ready, merge into [2] (or export & apply to avoid 
merge commits).
This is just one possible workflow.  There are probably several better.
