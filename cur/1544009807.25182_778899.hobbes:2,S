mem_cgroup_try_charge_swapin() at el. all swap-in codes.
In that functions, follwoing occurs.
==
    assume swp_entry which is being swapped-in
    lookup swap_cgroup for swp_entry.
    get memcg from swap_cgroup.
    charge() against memcg got by swap_cgroup. charge() will do css_get()
==
Currently, mem_cgroup->obsolete is used for making this never happen.
But, mem_cgroup->obsolete flag is broken,now.
I'm looking for alternative. (see other patches. I know there are several
ways to go.)
*AND* any kinds of hierarchy-tree-walk algorithm may call css_get() against
cgroup under rmdir() if it's not marked as REMOVED.
