We've switched to dual T1's bundled together and allocated 2Mbit/sec for
bkbits.net.  It will take a little while for the routes to change on all
networks (Savvis seems particularly stubborn) but most of you should be
able to get to *.bkbits.net now.
We'll turn on the traditional patch server and I'll post instructions on how
to use it as soon as we have.  Then anyone who wants can grab a changeset as
a regular patch.
