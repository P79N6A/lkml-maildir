Ouch we have both cpus running when this happens, and we have not
started any shutdown whatsoever.  This is the bit that sets up
the page tables for later use...
I think identity_map_pages will have problems with a kernel that does
the 4G/4G split, and it has known issues on some other architectures,
because they treat init_mm specially.  So the proper solution may be
to simply rewrite identity_map_pages. 
Before we do that in the short term we need to see if
identity_map_pages is actually doing anything bad.  You are
not using the 4G/4G split so that is not the cause.  So either
init_mm is now special in some way, or we have hit a generic kernel
bug.
So this may indeed be a tlb race.  But it is init_mm->cpu_vm_mask and
cpu_online map that are different.  With the implication being
that init_mm->cpu_vm_mask has cpus set that are not in cpu_online_map?
Very weird especially on SMP.
Without attribution I have a hard time making sense of which cpumask
is which so I can't draw any conclusions.  But I find it very
interesting that it is bits 2 and 3 that are set.  I wonder if
there is any mixup between logical cpu identities and apic ids.
