You are partly mistaken - tux does virtual domains like a champ.
Mass virtual hosting is easy and effective. Tux does need to pass
SSL requests off to a helper server though.

I'd love to see mod_perl for tux - did I miss something?
I'd be just as happy about php, and there is what looks like the beginning
of tux support in php. If tux could load and run php modules, it would 
open a lot of doors very quickly. (i.e. there are a lot more php 
programmers out there than are in the tiny, rather elite group of those 
who understand and can use the tux dynamic content api.)
