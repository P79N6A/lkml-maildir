Subject: oops when adding bridge interface, using v2.5.45

Hello,
Ever since I've been using the bridge with a 2.5 kernel I've been having a 
non-fatal oops when adding a bridge interface: adding a bridge works, then 
adding a first interface gives the oops below, adding a second interface 
works. Note that the bridge behaves correct afaik (as in "it works") and both 
interfaces get created, which is why this was no priority.
net/bridge/br_if.c::new_nbp() does
	p = kmalloc(sizeof(*p), GFP_KERNEL);
which triggers the oops through mm/slab.c::kmem_flagcheck()
I don't know what is wrong (I have no such problems with 2.4).
The trace is below:
Debug: sleeping function called from illegal context at mm/slab.c:1304
