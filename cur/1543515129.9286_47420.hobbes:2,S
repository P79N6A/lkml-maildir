Subject: trouble booting from raid (2.2.13ac/2.3.25), initrd fails too (2.3.25)

Hi,
I tried to boot from raid0 using 
md=0,0,3,0,/dev/sda2,/dev/sdb3
as kernel parameter. This works in 2.2.13 but not in 2.2.13ac1 or
2.3.25. It fails with:
Oops! md0 not running, giving up !
Bad md_map in ll_rw_block
The file Documentation/md.txt (which describes this method) is
unchanged in these kernel versions, so it should still work.
I tried to work around this with initrd (on 2.3.25), but the kernel
doesn't compile with it:
frodo:/usr/src/linux # make bzlilo
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2
-fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -fno-strength-reduce
-DCPU=686 -march=i686  -c -o init/main.o init/main.c
init/main.c: In function `start_kernel':
init/main.c:490: `memory_start' undeclared (first use in this function)
init/main.c:490: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
init/main.c:490: for each function it appears in.)
make: *** [init/main.o] Error 1
