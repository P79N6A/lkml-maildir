I have not used a machine that really needed this for quite some time now.
Usually even DSDTs that do not pass the "disassemble, then recompile with
iasl"-test seem to work much better in practice than they did before.
And seeing what stupid ideas people come up with (sharing DSDTs on
acpi.sf.net _is_ stupid, since the DSDT usually depends on things you
configured in your BIOS settings, memory size, etc.pp) it is probably
a good idea to keep this patch out of mainline.
It is usefull for debugging, sure, but somebody who can debug on this
level should also be able to patch his kernel :-)
