Yeah, understood.

OK, let's look at it another way.  Say your access control model used
kernel profiling data as part of policy.  It still makes sense to let
oprofile do that collection, and the LSM is just a consumer of that
data when it makes an acces control decision.  Perhaps a klunky analogy,
but do you see the idea?

Right, the measurement data collection stand alone, which no access
control decisions in sight (talking about the IMA LSM now), is what
tipped the scale.
