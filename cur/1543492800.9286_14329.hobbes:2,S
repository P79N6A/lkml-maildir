  This would be probably the cleanest solution but I think the solution
proposed by Jakub should also work (at least from kernel point which I'm
aware of).

  Maybe I'm missing something but I can't find anything about older format
of quota in current kernel. There is only one struct dqblk...

  I'm not sure what will do quota utilities but kernel will refuse to read
such quota file.

  This is much better solution. There we can have simplier kernel functions.

  No. Current code just reads data as they are. This is why the thread begun ;-).
