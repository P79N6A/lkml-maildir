I know, just giving you the background.

Oh, so it does, I wonder who did that.  Yes, I thought of doing it the
way its done there but rejected it on the grounds of ugliness - plus I
wasn't sure of some details of the VFS which meant I wasn't sure if it

The point of keeping ramfs simple isn't to reduce the kernel image
size, it's to keep it useful as an example of how to make a trivial
filesystem.
