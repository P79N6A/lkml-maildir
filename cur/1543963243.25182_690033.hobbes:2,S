I thought the thing to remove was the "get all locks". I didn't
realize the major problem was only the sorting of the array.
I'll add the global lock, it's worth it as it drops the worst case
number of steps by log(65536) times. Furthermore surely two concurrent
mm_notifier_lock will run faster as it'll decrease the cacheline
collisions. Since you ask to call it mmu_notifier_lock I'll also move
it to mmu_notifier.[ch] as consequence.
