OK.

Except I'd like non-root users to have tokens that they _cannot_ read, but 
that they can still pass over unix sockets.  I have no objection to also 
allowing user-readable tokens.
This way I could have a server with, say, a Kerberos service token such 
that a compromise of the server process does not compromise the service 
token.  (You still have a gotcha in that the kerberosd this would require 
would, for performance reasons, want to handle only ticket-granting 
traffic.  Still, you just mark the TGT unreadable and the individual 
session tickets readable, so that the damage of a compromise is limited to 
a few hours until the sessions expire.)
Yes, this would be a _lot_ more work than just blindly porting Kerberos' 
ticket cache, but it has security benefits.
And I really want a good token system in Linux -- that way the OpenAFS 
people will stop bitching and I might be able to use it again.
