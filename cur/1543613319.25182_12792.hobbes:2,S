It is not that bad, as only PTEs are moved, but ... currently code calls
mremap(), and in 95% of cases same address is returned, while after
change mremap() changes address in 100% of cases, so couple of bugs 
can be discovered due to this change.

You cannot move VMAs when app does not request mremap(), as you must notify
app about new location of area - app can have couple of pointers to this
memory, so you cannot move it around without app being informed.
And unfortunately you also cannot just skip existing VMAs by brk(), as
userspace remebers latest value returned by brk(), add size to it, and 
calls brk() to grow data segment. As apps decides about new brk() value, 
and app does not know that there is some VMA somewhere, kernel cannot 
do anything about it too - unfortunately.
