Sure it helps, though may be unnecessary once we can rely on userspace
pre-caching tools to do it in a more accurate and efficient way.
The main concern would be inter-file/inter-buffer readahead.
I have some data to support it:
% wc -l hda* startup.files
 1743 hda2_buffers      <== my /
 335 hda3_buffers       <== my /home
 1130 startup.files
 3208 total
The above cache sizes sum up to ~110MB, so it's about 36KB per seek.
Thanks,
Wu
