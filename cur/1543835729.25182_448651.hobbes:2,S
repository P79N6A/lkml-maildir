You are empirically wrong in my case. I can't make you hear the difference
in noise, but perhaps this will convince you:
$ sensors | grep CPU
CPU_Fan:   2359 RPM  (min = 4000 RPM)                     
CPU:         +61 C  (low  =   +10 C, high =   +50 C)     
$ sudo /etc/init.d/powernowd start
 * Starting powernowd...  			[ ok ]
$ sensors | grep CPU
CPU_Fan:   1411 RPM  (min = 4000 RPM)                     
CPU:         +57 C  (low  =   +10 C, high =   +50 C)     
$ sudo /etc/init.d/powernowd stop
 * Stopping powernowd:				[ ok ]
$ sensors | grep CPU
CPU_Fan:   2452 RPM  (min = 4000 RPM)                     
CPU:         +61 C  (low  =   +10 C, high =   +50 C)     
And this with only seconds in between starting and stopping, on an idle
system.

That I've measured, and indeed, the same amount of power is drawn from the
mains. But the reduction in fan noise is worth it.
On this CPU, HLT may simply not be doing as good a job. Who knows.
processor       : 0
vendor_id       : GenuineIntel
cpu family      : 15
model           : 4
model name      : Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 3.00GHz
stepping        : 1
cpu MHz         : 3000.000
cache size      : 1024 KB
It does reduce effective CPU to 300MHz though, which is a lot.
Kind regards,
bert
