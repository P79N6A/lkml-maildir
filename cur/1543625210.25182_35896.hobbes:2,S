BTW that's not the problem I'm seeing, Alt-SysRq-*ANYTHING* is not
caught from any of the offending keyboards because (IIRC) they send
Alt-SysRq as a two-code sequence, with the (apparently) Alt-Down code
repeated before the command keycode - thus, all the command keycode
parser sees (it seems it looks only at the first byte after Alt-SysRq)
is the Alt-Down keycode, which is not a command.
