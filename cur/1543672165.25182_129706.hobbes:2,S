Subject: contrary ide_register() lock description 2.5.69

The comments above ide_unregister() function definition
in lk 2.5.69 include this:
  *      Take care with the callbacks. These have been split to avoid
  *      deadlocking the IDE layer. The shutdown callback is called
  *      before we take the lock and free resources. It is up to the
  *      caller to be sure there is no pending I/O here, and that
  *      the interfce will not be reopened (present/vanishing locking
  *      isnt yet done btw). After we commit to the final kill we
  *      call the cleanup callback with the ide locks held.
The code that follows in ide.c shows the ide_lock
being taken prior to the shutdown callback and then
let go prior to cleanup callback. That's not what
those comments suggest.
However I do like the remaining comments in ide_unregister():
  *      Unregister restores the hwif structures to the default state.
  *      This is raving bonkers.
