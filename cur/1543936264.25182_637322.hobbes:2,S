Hi Jon,
>>> The following series implements standard linux module aliasing for i2c modules on arch=powerpc. It then converts the mpc i2c driver from being a platform driver to an open firmware one. I2C device names are picked up from the device tree. Module aliasing is used to translate from device tree names into to linux kernel names. Several i2c drivers are updated to use the new aliasing.

I can only second this. The latest version of i2c-cpm
(
http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/linuxppc/patch?person=1023&id=15902
) makes
use of this patch, as well. On the dbox2, loading and unloading of
modules in any order just works fine.
Thanks,
Jochen
