Yes, it took too long.
Anyway, pushing non-working code to mainline is a bad thing
(I can show some proofs for this statement).

Please point me to some (working) code outside drivers/ide
which knows i.e. something about 'ide_hwif_t' type.

drivers/ide/arm/icside.c
My main concerns are:
- ide-lpd7a40x.c should go into drivers/ide/arm/
- you are setting IDE_NO_IRQ in ide_init_hwif_ports() which is used
  in many places in generic IDE code - anybody wanting to understand
  interactions with your code + generic code will have serious
  problems (especially if knows _nothing_ about lpd7a40x)
- hwif->mmio is set to 2 but resource handling is missed
- ide_init_default_hwifs() is OBSOLETE and shouldn't be used

Yes, idea isn't complex but spotting all places needing change is.

pre-select but you can change it to be substitute if you need
(just remember to update all users if you decide to do this)
IMO it is better to fix it correctly than to do hacks like this
in lpd7a40x_ide_outb() (which is minor performance hit btw)

That's what I'm talking about - it shouldn't have been integrated. :-)
Cheers.
