Hi, 
kernel-rt-14 rocks but wiht kernel-rt-15 I got kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG:
eth1: transmit timed out, I downgrade to kernel-rt-14 and that got this
problem anymore.
I not use my on-board via-rhine II Ethernet. 
This tests has been made with one external Ethernet card, one Realtek
Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8139/8139C/8139C+ (rev 10)
kernel-rt-14 without notsc option and boot clean, don't have any oops
anymore.
Thanks,
