Note that this patch is not removing the CAP_SYS_ADMIN requirement,
just allowing the operation to happen outside of clone().  Unlike
domain transitions in selinux, which should be tied to exec() so
as to tie them to known code, I don't see what clone() would provide
in terms of safety which we are losing.

I'm not sure this is to do with PAM functionality, rather than
just its design.  Is there a way of "fixing" pam so that we don't
need unshare()?
