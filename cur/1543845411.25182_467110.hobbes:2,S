Subject: [PATCH 0/5] Message signaled irq handling cleanups

The following patch set should be enough to clear up the
outstanding issues with genirq on i386 and x86_64.  This actually
takes things a step farther and moves all of architecture
dependencies I could find into the appropriate architecture.
So hopefully we are finally close enough that other architectures
will be able implement msi support, without too much trouble.
msi: Simplify msi sanity checks by adding with generic irq code.
msi: Only use a single irq_chip for msi interrupts
msi: Refactor and move the msi irq_chip into the arch code.
msi: Move the ia64 code into arch/ia64
htirq: Tidy up the htirq code
