Subject: TCP window scaling still bad in 2.6.7-bk17

I have a tcpdump and a description of what happens here
http://xoomer.virgilio.it/incident/tcpdump.out
with www.kernel.org, but I'm mostly shut off the entire 'net.
The _only_ site I found I can browse without disabling TCP
  window scaling is 
http://www.google.it
.
My system:
  RedHat 9 base distro
  2.6.7-bk17 plus ACX100 out-of-kernel wireless driver (version
   0.2.0-pre8_plus_fixes_13) from acx100.sf.net
  built with binutils 2.15.91.0.1 and GCC 3.4.0
System behaved properly until 2.6.7-bk1, was bad since 2.6.7-bk7
  (haven't tried in-between kernels as I was on holiday).
I also tried walking up to my router and connecting via eth0
  instead of wlan0 (to rule out the wireless driver) - still the
  connection to www.kernel.org hangs (always -bk17).
I'm available for further digging, please CC: me on replies as I
  only read lkml from the USSG archives.
Thanks,
