Linus,
Sheesh, Deja Vue.
Do you recall when Andy Tannenbaum said that Linux was a waste of time, 
inexcuseably bad software engineering, and that he would have failed you 
if you had been his student?
Godhood did little to help Dr. Tannenbaum, eh?  
Some kid from Finland chose to ignore that caustic God and began working
on his own.  With help from his friends, he has now come full circle.
Welcome to Godhood Mr. Torvalds... may Dr. Tannenbaum's comments remain 
forever fresh in your mind.
"Just say no.  LE is here to stay, just live with it", "Andrea, just go 
away", "David...get the hell out of my mailbox", ... 
Ack!
Gods of the Unix pantheon sometimes find that a quiet stroll around the 
campus of U.C. Berkeley late at night (when they are not likely to be
recognized) calms frayed nerves.  Camping within earshot of the surf near 
Santa Cruz also helps.  (I would also suggest Wollongong but it is a long 
way to travel and kangeroos make some people sneeze ;)
