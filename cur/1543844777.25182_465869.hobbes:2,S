I know they won't. I only thought I have to try, after seeing
the debian problem and googling out a few negative posts about
these checks.

They do not "want otherwise". They do the right thing - use
shm_open() and then mmap(), but mmap() suddenly fails. The apps
are not guilty. Neither I think the debian guys are.

I don't think they want to prevent PROT_EXEC mmaps. Almost
certainly not. Maybe they thought they would only block mere
execve() calls and the like, I don't know. My point is that
this change (use of "noexec") should not break the properly
written apps, but right now it does. Is it stated anywhere
in the shm_open() manpage or elsewhere that you must not use
"noexec" on tmpfs or you'll get troubles with mmap?

Thanks for the pointer, but that looks like the user-space
issue to me. Why ld.so can't figure out the "noexecness" and
do the right thing itself? Or does it figure out the "noexecness"
exactly by trying the PROT_EXEC mmap and see if it fails?
