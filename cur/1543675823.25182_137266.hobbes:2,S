You should expect V3 to be slow at quad CPU smp benchmarks because 
balancing is giant locked.   V4 fixes this with fine grained locking, we 
hope to release at Linux Tag in July.  Fortunately quad CPU boxes will 
not be economical compared to dual CPU boxes until V4 has been out for a 
while....;-)  V4 CPU  usage and general performance has gotten a lot 
better, we need to put a new snapshot on our website.....
