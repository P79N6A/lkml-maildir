Change your MoBo ... It is hardware revision.

I heard that some UDMA ALi problems are CRC-error related.
But I'm not absolutely sure if this is the problem cocerning low chipset
revisions.
If so, it mighat be possible do disable CRC-error checking.
However it may inflict other kernel part opration ...

driver assumes 40MHz if it is not set.
