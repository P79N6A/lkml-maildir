Damn I'm being dense tonight.  No, that bug was due to calling "current"
from the wrong process context, not from an invalid context.
(Self-flagellate, self-flaggelate).

Yes I forgot about that.  (Self-flagellate).  However that is
architecture specific.  If it's not an SMP Vax port, no big deal.  If it
is, there's a way to arrange that smp_processor_id returns the correct
processor id even from the interrupt stack.
