Yep, as I said in the response to Eric a number of us had talked in
the past about using the GPU for some audio operations that are just
too CPU intensive - reverb, multi-band compressors, etc. See Jamin as
an example of a great app that brings most DAW type boxes to their
knees.

So what happens to the file system if the user changes screen
resolution, color depth, etc.? There must be features to manage stuff
like that?
