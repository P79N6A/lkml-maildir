	I would just like to add my "me too" the responses confirming
that the IDE disk hangs still exist in pre3-2 and pre3-ac2, in this
case on a 27.5GB model of IDE disk that works fine on a number of other
computers here.   I have just switched to running the disk with
"hdparm -W 0".  It usually takes several hours for the problem to recur,
so I will not know the result of that until tomorrow.
