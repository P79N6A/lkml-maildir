Odd.  I did not see that in Ingo's patches on the kernel list.
Perhaps only user space cares about storing the tid in the futex
field.

The point of containers and their building blocks largely is isolation
so you can have multiple different user space environments on one
machine.  So for most of the pieces that can really confuse user space
the answer is don't do that then.  The classic example is pid files
for remembering a daemon is running.
Interactions do need to happen between pid spaces for certain
administrative actions, and as much as possible I don't want
to reinvent the wheel.  Pid alases in the kernel are for
that purpose, and so will likely play a role in the RT signal
and the sysv shm case.
