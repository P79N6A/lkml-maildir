Hi,
We have found that EGCS 1.1 (or GCC 2.8.0) compiles the "printk" symbol rather differently than GCC 2.7.2.3 on Linux 2.1.13x kernels. 
We use GCC 2.7.2.3 to compile our Open Sound System sound drivers and when they load, they are complaining that: 
unresolved symbol printk_Rsmp_dd132261
Can somebody in the EGCS group verify the printk ksym versioning compared to the one generated by GCC 2.7.2.3?. Note that all other ksyms are fine.
Once you compile the kernel with GCC 2.7.2.3, OSS loads just fine.
Best regards
Dev Mazumdar
