UPDATE:
Now I have upgraded to 2.2.18pre19 + ide-2.2.18pre18 + raid-2.2.18-A2 +
patched eepro100.
Unfortunately, I still get:
hde: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hde: dma_intr: error=0x10 { SectorIdNotFound }, LBAsect=15347359,
sector=15347328
hde: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hde: dma_intr: error=0x10 { SectorIdNotFound }, LBAsect=15347359,
sector=15347328
hde: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hde: dma_intr: error=0x10 { SectorIdNotFound }, LBAsect=15347359,
sector=15347328
hde: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hde: dma_intr: error=0x10 { SectorIdNotFound }, LBAsect=15347359,
sector=15347328
after a few minutes/hours of uptime (60-180 minutes).  I even tried some
SysRq keys and those wouldn't work.  (hard lockup).  So what do I try from
here?  I d'nt think there is any way to disable DMA in the hardware (on
the Promise anyway).  Should I pull out hde and throw in another seagate?
thanks for any ideas.
