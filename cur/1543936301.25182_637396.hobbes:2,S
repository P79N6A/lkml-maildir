What's *your* point?
MMCONFIG is known broken. If we ever start enabling it more (ie start 
using it even if it's not reserved in the e820 tables), all that known 
breakage will come and bite us in the *ss.
We need to have some armor-plated underwear to protect against that 
ass-biting, and that's what Arjan's patch is. 
Tell me what *other* armor plating you could have that actually works?
