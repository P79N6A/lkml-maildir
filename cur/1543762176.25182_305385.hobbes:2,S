Many people will tell you to use the /proc file-system.
I suggest you make a simple "character" driver and access
your kernel structure using ioctl() or mmap().
You don't add your own system call __ever__, even if you
are a long-time kernel developer. The current API already
has lots of standard interface capabilities. Thinking, even
for an instant, that you need more means that you don't
understand Unix/Linux.
