Definitely a good reason.  It seem many assume file names are a local thing,
but this is not so. Now consider the case with an external firewire
disk or memory stick created on a machine with iso-8859-1 as the system character
set and e.g xfs as the file system. What happens when I hook it up to a new redhat
installation that thinks file names are best stored as utf8? Most non-ascii
file names aren't even legal in utf8.
