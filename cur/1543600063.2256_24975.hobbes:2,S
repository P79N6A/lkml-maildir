Unfortunately once scrollback gets enabled (and allocates its scrollback
buffers, fills couple of pointers here and there), it is not trivial to 
disable it again. If someone feels for doing that, do that. But I think
that changing default scrollback value from 32768 to 0 is better - as
you'll still have scrollback if your hardware can do it.
