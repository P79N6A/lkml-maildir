Btw., this means that an smp_rmb() ought to be enough too. (I sent such 
a test-patch to Fernando.) Also, i'd like the change to smp_rmb() be 
done separately from the fix so that we have the most-conservative 
variant in and thus it becomes bisectable. I'd like to avoid another few 
months of latency for fixing yet another bug in this area...
