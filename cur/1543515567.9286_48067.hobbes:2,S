Jeff, cut the bullshit. This isn't the first time you've fudded
something on the list. Your lies are NOT appricated. (i.e. do a archive
search for your name and GPL). 
Legally there is NO such thing as 'open source'. There is the OSD, which
this should be completely okay with. 
I'd like to know the name of your attorneys as I can't believe that a
real attorney would make such a bold statement on just a few hours
consideration. Perhaps you should be looking for a new attorney?
Furthermore, if you actually bother to read the poor english license of
the code, it's aparent that the language is intended to limit use but
distribution, as the GPL already does. It looks like all he is trying to
do is preventing someone like Netware (or netapp!) from just taking his
FS.
I agree that Hans should clear it up. I'm sure he will real soon.
Perhaps you are just afraid that new developments like ReiserFS are
making your efforts on the near dead NWFS increasingly pointless?
I wonder why your wonderful attorneys forgot to warn you that you can
get in trouble for making false comments about a compeating product, and
advise you to keep your mouth shut?
Strange.
