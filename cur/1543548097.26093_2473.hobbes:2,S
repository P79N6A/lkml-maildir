Sorry...  You're probably bigtime out of luck.  I sent some bug
reports in before which happened while vmware's modules were
loaded and was told point blank that nobody would or could
help.  I was explained "why" too, and afterwards I had to agree.
The kernel developers do not have the time or capability to chase
bugs with patched kernels, especially kernels with commercial
modules loaded.
If you can repeat the problem with a pristine official penguin
pee kernel, I'm sure everyone would be interested though.
Hope this helps.

But I have this ugly feeling that I'm coming down with the same flu that
everybody else in my family had the last week, so I'd better release this
before I start puking on my keyboard.
