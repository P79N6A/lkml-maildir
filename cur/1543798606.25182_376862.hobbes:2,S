Tony,
we should really take the chance to make the kernel smaller since we 
don't have to become active to make it bigger. This happens every day by 
itself. Furthermore I'd guess that for the current and future IA64 
implementations we might even win performance by having functions out of 
line since we have a really fast call mechanism here. Of course any 
difference heavily depends on the cache utilization so there would be 
some benchmark needed. At least for the udelay the answer is easy and 
must be "do it out of line".
Did anyone already run a benchmark for comparison of inline vs. out of 
line for IA64? Or does anybody want to do it?
Christian
