Just a quick comment. Andrea, unless your machine has some hardware
that imply pernode runqueues will help (nodelevel caches etc), I fail 
to understand how this is helping you ... here's a simple theory though. 
If your system is lightly loaded, your pernode queues are actually 
implementing some sort of affinity, making sure processes stick to 
cpus on nodes where they have allocated most of their memory on. I am 
not sure what the situation will be under huge loads though.
As I have mentioned to some people before, percpu/pernode/percpuset/global
runqueues probably all have their advantages and disadvantages, and their
own sweet spots. Wouldn't it be really neat if a system administrator
or performance expert could pick and choose what scheduler behavior he
wants, based on how the system is going to be used?
