2.2.18 sometimes sees 61 GB, sometimes 32 GB. I don't call that hard to
understand. And I don't use 2.4 on that machine, see previous posting. I
also mentined that I use 2.2.18 with Andre's IDE patches.

It was probably t he BIOS of this newer machine that somehow killed the
software clip. I can't explain otherwise.
The setmax program initially gave errors, so that's why I switched to
ibmsetmax.
If the vague behaviour starts appearing again I'll debug the thing. For
now I blaim the award bios :)
