>Your patch seems to be still word wrapped.
I hope this is better with the next version I'm going to
send out in a few minutes. Sorry about that.
>The noflags variant should be probably data driven too.
I rewrote the entire code to use an offset/size configuration
instead of declaring structs for the various architecture
variants.

They will be part of the next version. I keep the two patches separate,
I hope that does not confuse any scripts that try to extract patches 
from the email.

I tried to keep the interface as simple and flexible as possible.
A user would typically want to read the trace from back to front until
he
read enough trace. But I could also think of a more random accesses
pattern.
If you know you're going to read the entire buffer, reading it from
front to back might be preferrable.
The memory interface uses peek and poke to read and write a single 
word, respectively. I think that the READ_RECORD command matches the
PEEK command pretty well.
I would expect a user to provide a stream view to higher levels if it
is beneficial for him. Such a view can be easily implemented with
the current interface.
>Also not sure why you have separate config and allocate_buffer steps.
>They could be easily combined, couldn't they? 
The buffer is typically allocated once per session, whereas a user
may want to turn on and off tracing several times during a session.

I would not expect many users to want to change that value.
I would make this go into the /usr/include/sys/ptrace.h header file, so
the
ptrace user is aware of the limit.
If it turns out that there is a need to make this more flexible, we can
always do it with a later patch.

I cached the values. The MSR is read during initialization and the 
enabled and disabled variants are stored in the processor configuration.
grep did not find another use of MSR_IA32_DEBUGCTLMSR anywhere in the
kernel.
thanks and regards,
