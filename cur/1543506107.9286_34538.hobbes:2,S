  process handling functions must have support in kernel of OS
  (I don't speak about software dispatchers runing as stand-alone program.)
  someone use clone() and functions to get and handle process id,
  someone CreateThread()and simillar bunch of functions ...

  Cygwin has his own fork() and clone() implementation but it's a lot
  slower than win32 API for threads. I don't know why ...
