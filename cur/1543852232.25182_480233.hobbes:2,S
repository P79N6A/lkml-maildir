Subject: [patch 0/4] i386, x86_64: fix the irqbalance quirk for E7520/E7320/E7525

Mechanism of selecting physical mode in genapic when cpu hotplug is enabled
on x86_64, broke the quirk(quirk_intel_irqbalance()) introduced for working
around the transposing interrupt message errata in E7520/E7320/E7525
(revision ID 0x9 and below. errata #23 in 
http://download.intel.com/design/chipsets/specupdt/30304203.pdf
).
This errata requires the mode to be in logical flat, so that interrupts
can be directed to more than one cpu(and thus use hardware IRQ balancing
enabled by BIOS on these platforms).
Following four patches fixes this by moving the quirk to early quirk
and forcing the x86_64 genapic selection to logical flat on these platforms.
Thanks to Shaohua for pointing out the breakage.
