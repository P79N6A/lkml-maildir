Subject: AGP & non-root mmap calls: "lending" priviledges to a client

Here at Xi we're using a client-side rendering model for the new X server,
leaving large tasks done entirely in the client space.  This in fact gives a 
much lower latency for some operations.  It is simply the wave of the 
future for the complex graphical output that an SMP system has to support.
A question that has been presented to us is that of direct mmap() access to 
AGP bridge-viewed RAM.  For our AGP/GART device, the client non-root 
processes that are coordinated by the X server are handed a "magic cookie" 
that can be used to "bless" a device file descriptor (allowed inside the 
kernel) ... and thus allow any mmap as needed directly from the AGP/GART 
device.  In general, then, only smart and X-server coordinated processes are 
then able to do this, enhancing stability, but decreasing unneeded
centralization.
Are there any plans to allow "handing over" priviledges to clients, from one 
process to another?  Should a technique of "trusted-cookies" be used to 
allow non-root clients access to important devices?  This technique is easy, 
sensibly secure (at least, the first priviledges is granted properly) and 
takes little code.
