Hi Kristian.
I think the problem here is that ide-cd tries to access /dev/hdd which is already used by ide-scsi. That looks like a forgotten check in ide-cd.
Could you first try 2.4.19-rc1 ? I couldn't reproduce a hang with it. A second "modprobe ide-cd" only stalls linux for 2 seconds and I'm getting:
hdd: set_drive_speed_status: status=0xd0 { Busy }
which means that modprobe is stucking in D state:
root      1288  0.0  2.2  5740 5740 pts/1    SL   09:59   0:00 cdrecord blank=fa
root      1290 14.9  0.2  1712  756 pts/1    D    09:59   0:10 modprobe ide-cd i
After finished burning (hdc is accessible again) it comes back.

If this still persists:
It could be helpful for the developers to have the oops-output. Try to attach a serial console. First enable CONFIG_SERIAL_CONSOLE in your kernel-config. If done, append the following options to lilo. For example my lilo.conf:
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.4.19-rc1-kp1
 	label=udmacda
 	append="console=ttyS0,57600n8,vt102 console=tty0"
 	read-only
 	root=/dev/hda1
Then you need a second computer to capture that output (with mingetty or anything similar). Maybe you could redirect the klog output via syslog to another machine. I hope you have the possibilities.
