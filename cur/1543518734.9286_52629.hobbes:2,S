Your patch is buggy as you forgot to hash the buffers inside the
block_*write* stuff.
For brw_page (in create_page_buffers()) we probably don't care to take the
buffer hashed and I think you can safely remove such change from your
patch. 2.2.x is not doing that either. This mean you can't swapout on
raid5 of course, but that is a minor issue IMHO.
>Is it bad to synchronize access through the buffer-cache? I dont think so
I remeber well the argument: the new pagecache will run fsync reducing the
complexity of an order of magnitude for reaching the metadata with an
almost always empty buffer hash so no need of per-inode dirty buffer-queue
as we are just fast enough compared to 2.2.x. Also the buffer hash size is
been shrunk in 2.3.x for this reason. With your proposal we return to
2.2.x regime and we have the buffer hash filled with both data and
metadata.

The problem I see is that today you say:

and yesterday there was the argument that an almost empty buffer hash
(with only the metadata buffers in it) was one of the main feature/huge
improvements of the new page cache design (mainly for fsync).
So there are two possibility: or you are wrong now or the previous
argument was a red herring.
I quote here one Linus's email of some month ago that I remeber well. I
agree with Linus and I just think you are wrong assuming it make an not
noticeable slowdown anywhere.
