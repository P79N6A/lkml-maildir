Hello
I am trying to implement a (soft) real time kthread on a dual cpu
machine. Basic design is very simple, the kthread  binds
to cpu 1 sets itself to a high real time priority and never releases this
cpu. Whenever it needs to wait a little I use the assembler pause command.
The operating system should be running on cpu 0.
Yet I have 3 problems:
1. Rcu never unlocks ( dentry starvation ).
2. I cannot ssh to the machine when this kthread is runing. This has to
   do some how with events workqueue.
3. What about all other kthreads,workqueue,tasklets in the system ? aio,md,
   can I simply un-invoke them ?
Is there an easy way to do it ?
Is there a framework to do it ?
thank you
raz
