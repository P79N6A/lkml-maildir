    It WOULD BE. Think about clusters. With 32bit pids you can use 8bit to identify
    node and 24bit to identify task on that node. To do this you'll need
    max_pid==16777215. IMHO max_pid is exactly right here.
Maybe. But it looks like you didnt understand my point of view.
Knobs are harmful.
What happens if we have /proc/sys/kern/max_pid?
People will want to add code to the kernel to do
the right thing when max_pid is decreased.
People will add code in userspace to find the right value for max_pid.
People will report mysterious crashes that
turn out to be caused by max_pid=64.
We will have a max_pid HOWTO.
That is what I want to avoid. If there is a compile time constant
that is 2^31 by default, 2^15 for people that ask for backward
compatibility, 2^23 for people with clusters, then everybody is happy.
No need to change this value dynamically.
Anyway, all this is unimportant. Someone must look at proc.
Maybe I already did something a month or so ago, but then
Alexander also was changing proc. Hope to have time next week
to look at the details if nobody else does it first.
