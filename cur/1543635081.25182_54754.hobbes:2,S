In fact, I believe I found out that it's some weird driver interaction
problem.
I have an IDE controller on VIA 686B southbridge on motherboard and PDC20269
as a PCI card. Now, I had Linux on a drive attached to the VIA controller
without any problems. The drive became too small so I added the U133TX2 card
and a new drive and installed Linux on that one. No matter which one of the
installations is booted, the system will lock up if the VIA controller is in
use at the same time as the PDC. However, system seems to be stable (short
test priod though) if only the PDC controller is in use. (I left the old
drives attached to the VIA controller unmounted.)
Does this problem sound similar to yours?
