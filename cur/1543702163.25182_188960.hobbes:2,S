If you add -W switch to CFLAGS, you'd get A LOT of more warnings.
Also just reading manpage on gcc around description of that flag will
give you a list of options to individually turn on certain check types.
Also gcc 3.3 have this sort of " unsigned < 0 | unsigned > 0" checks on by
default, I think.
Bye,
