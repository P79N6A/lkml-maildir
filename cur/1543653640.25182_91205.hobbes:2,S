What is the workload?  And in which journalling mode was ext3
being used?
Was the workload actually being run against ext3?

A non-uptodate page mapped into pagetables.  I _think_ I
can see how that can happen.  If the workload was, say,
bash-shared-mapping...
If it is reproducible, does the removal of the ClearPageUptodate
statement from mm/truncate.c:truncate_complete_page() make it
go away?
Thanks.
