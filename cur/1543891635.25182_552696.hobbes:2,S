sure, but once you remove this snippet near the top of
drivers/char/nvram.c:
...
#  if defined(CONFIG_COBALT)
#    include <linux/cobalt-nvram.h>
#    define MACH COBALT
#  else
#    define MACH PC
#  endif
...
then everything else COBALT-related in that file should be tossed as
well, which would include stuff conditional on:
  #if MACH == COBALT
and so on.  just making sure that what you're saying is that *all*
COBALT-related content in that file can be thrown out.  i'll submit a
patch shortly and you can pass judgment.
