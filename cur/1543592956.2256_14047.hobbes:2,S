When the user has gameport hardware compiled it as a module and they
have es1371 bult into the kernel then es1371 silently ignores the
gameport, even if the gameport modules has been loaded.  This violates
the principle of least surprise, a user configuring both gameport and
es1371 expects to use the gameport, kbuild should support that instead
of silently ignoring the combination.
