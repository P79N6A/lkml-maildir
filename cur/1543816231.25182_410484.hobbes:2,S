There are many ways to skin this cat.
As an example: you could make pid and tgid global to the function and
set them to 0. At the end of the if statements, you could check if at
least one of them is set - if not you know none was passed and bail out.

it would for attribute setting - but not for others. As a general
comment this is one of those areas where cutnpasting aka TheLinuxWay(tm)
could result in errors.

Ok, I understand the dilemma now - but still not thrilled with having
two messages.
Perhaps you could have nesting of TLVs? This is widely used in the net
code for example
i.e:
TLV = TASKSTATS_TYPE_TGID/PID
    TLV = TASKSTATS_TYPE_STATS
Look at using nla_nest_start/end/cancel
