	Folks, the final (as far as I'm concerened) version of minixfs
fixes for 2.4 is on
ftp://ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/minix-final.gz
It's against test9-pre6, but it should apply to any recent 2.4.0-test*.
Testers needed. Unless I hear bug reports it will go to Linus for
inclusion into the tree. It fixes the same sort of races that was recently
fixed in ext2.
Patch seems to work here, but any extra eyes are very welcome.
Linus, if you prefer to get the patch by email rather than fetching it by
FTP - tell me and I'll send it (40Kb unpacked, so it's definitely too
large for posting on l-k).
							Cheers,
								Al
