Is seems so, my DMI tables contain some strings that we could
use to trigger up this laptop recognision (obtained after enabling
dmi_printk in the source):
	DMI table at 0x000DC010.
	BIOS Vendor: Phoenix Technologies LTD
	BIOS Version: R0204P1
	BIOS Release: 09/12/00
	System Vendor: Sony Corporation    .
	Product Name: PCG-C1VE(FR)        .
	Version 01                  .
	Serial Number 28316054-5120966    .
	Board Vendor: Sony Corporation    .
	Board Name: PCG-C1VE(FR)        .
But it doesn't seem to me like the dmi routines (arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c)
were designed to be used from outside this scope.
I could implement this in two different ways:
	- add a callback in this file which will initialise
	  a global var we could test in the driver.
	or
	- export the dmi_ident tab and maybe some check routines/macros
	  to the rest of the kernel, giving each driver the possibility
	  to access this info.
What does the audience think ?
Stelian.
