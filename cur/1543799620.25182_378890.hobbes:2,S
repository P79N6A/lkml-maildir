I'm not sure I understand.  Mutex semantics allow for memory accesses to
be moved into the critical region but not vice versa.  This is true for Java
and it's pretty much agreed by all the "experts" that it's allowed in Posix
if there was such a thing as a formal definition of mutex semantics
in Posix.  It would also seem to be to be the reason why Intel designed the
release semantics that way, so the hardware, not just the compiler, could
move code into the critical region for better performance.
So I suspect the problem is something else.
