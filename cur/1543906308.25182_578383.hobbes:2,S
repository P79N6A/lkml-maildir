OK, there seems to be a consensus on that ;)

Well, those are _very_ rare, I'd only add those if there's a demand
for them.

If the too many variants are bothersome, then I'd rather just have the
array variant, and give 1 as an array size for the non-array case.

I don't really like this, introducing new gfp flags just makes
grepping harder.
I do think that at least having a zeroing and a non-zeroing variant
makes sense.
