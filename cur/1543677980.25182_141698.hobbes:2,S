Hello,
I'd like to propose something for Kconfig:
I've spent hours to get Linux-2.5 to run. I was stuck with no virtual 
terminals
because by default these depend on 'input' which was compiled as a module.
I think it would be easier to see that an option is disabled instead of 
hiding it.
Then one would look into the 'help' of that option and see that it's 
disabled
because of some other option.
So maybe in 'menuconfig' in the global options a new option 'Show all 
options'
and in each menu
[ ]      -> choosable
< >    -> modulable
[*]     -> chosen
<M>   -> as module
[-]      -> disabled
in this case, I was not seeing the fact that 'Virtual Terminals' depended on 
'input'
which was compiled as a module...
