   We can simply lock the pagecachelock and the pagemap_lru_lock at the
   beginning of the cleaning function. page_launder() use to do that.
   Thats why I asked Andrea if there was long hold times by shrink_caches().
Ok, I see.
I do think it's silly to hold the pagecache_lock during pure scanning
activities of shrink_caches().
It is known that pagecache_lock is the biggest scalability issue on
large SMP systems, and thus the page cache locking patches Ingo and
myself did.
Franks a lot,
