I can see the repeatability argument; on the flipside, having a system
of "opportunistic atime", eg as good as you can go cheaply, but with
minimum guarantees has some attraction as well. For example one could
imagine a system where the inode gets it's atime updated anyway, just
not flagged for writing back to disk. If it later undergoes some event
that would cause it to go to disk, it gets preserved...
otoh that's even more unpredictable since VM pressure could drop this
update early.
For the dirty case, such drawbacks don't exist; it's just one more step
of "when we can cheaply".
