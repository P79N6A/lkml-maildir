I want to make a note to everyone that this is the first time this
whole merge window that someone who submitted a regression causing
commit even remotely suggested that it be reverted.
I think Andrew should be commended.
This is tons better than the "revert?  no way, that makes me look bad
and makes more work for me!"  methodology that others seem to
subscribe to.
