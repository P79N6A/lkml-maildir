My reading of the standard indicates that the return values
have meaning ONLY if EINTR is returned.  I changed the POSIX
Clocks & timers patch to do it this way, and, yes it is
observable from user space.  My test code tried to pass a
bad return address to flush out an error which failed
because the address was not used so I just changed the
test.  My reading of the prior nanosleep seemed to say the
same thing, i.e. the address  was not dereferenced on
success.
I have not looked at your code yet, but I am concerned that
the restart may not be able to get to the original
parameters. For nanosleep this is not a problem, but for
clock_nanosleep there are 4 parameters, at least two of
which are needed for restart (the Clock and the return
address).  (See the POSIX timers patch for example.)
