Probably. In principle getcpu() (where does the sched_ come from btw?)
is only designed for the case where you don't set the affinity explicitely;
otherwise you should already know where you are and don't need it.
The cache is optimized for the case when you run without affinity
and change CPUs only rarely (which is normal) so it is kept valid for a 
jiffie. And you always need to handle an outdated result from getcpu
anyways because you can't disable preemption from user space and could
switch any time.
In short your test case has a broken design.

The vsyscall/kernel can't reset the cache because it is managed by the
application.
Hmm ok one could probably define memset(..., 0) as a invalidation
interface, but because of the considerations above i don't think
it is really needed.
