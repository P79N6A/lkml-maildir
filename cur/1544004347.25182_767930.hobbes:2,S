What I say here is not "implement fairness" but "please make this algorithm easy
to be updated." If you'll implement soft-limit, please design this code to be
easily reused. (Again, I don't say do it now but please make code simpler.)
Can you make this code iterative rather than recursive ?
I don't like this kind of recursive call with complexed lock/unlock.
