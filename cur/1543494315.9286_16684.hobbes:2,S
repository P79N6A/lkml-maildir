   I don't know what you mean with "medium-low code model"; I guess if
   it was up to me I'd say to heck with it, and waste 1/4294967296 of
   the address space as a 4 GB "null pointer check region"...
   I presume the only reason you want that is to run 32-bit
   code/64-bit data or something like that (shades of DOS.)
It's an important code model which will satisfy the needs of %99 of
all applications, it puts all code and data of the executable in the
low 32-bits of the address space.  It allows all function calls done
within the executable to be a single instruction, and all address
formation to be done in 2 instructions for all objects within the
executable...  the 64-bit types are the same etc.
We compile the sparc64 Linux kernel itself using this code model for
those advantages.  We used to use the medium-med code model (low
44-bit address space) and the difference in the generated code is
phenominal.
