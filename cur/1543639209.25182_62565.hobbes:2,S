Hi,
anybody knows how to do this?
I was hoping to be able to set an option like "full_duplex=1" or
something when loading the module, but this doesn't work. Also doing a
"modinfo tg3" tells me there's only a debug parm (tg3_debug) for the
module.
Machine: Dell PowerEdge 2650
OS/kernel: SuSE 8 with standard kernel (2.4.18-64GB-SMP)

duplex.

I also tried mii-tool on the interface which reports this:
SIOCGMIIPHY on 'eth0' failed: Operation not supported
Please let me know if more info from my part is needed for
troubleshooting. Many thanks in advance.
Best regards,
