My bash man page says the following under "CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS":
       string1 == string2
              True if the strings are equal.  = may be used in place
              of == for strict POSIX compliance.
This is bash 3.1 as packaged by Debian.
So I think "=" is the correct thing to use for compatibility with dash
or other non-bash shells, since as far as I know, there are no
situations where a comparison with "=" will fail but "==" will succed.
(ie "=" is strictly more compatible).
