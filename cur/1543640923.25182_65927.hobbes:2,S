Hi,
just installed the preempt stuff on a 2.4.19 here
running on a laptop and keep getting the
"dreaded"  exited with preempt_count 1
messages.
there is modprobe,kdeinit,aplay,less,find,grep,automount
and others misbehaving.
As this is a laptop and I would like to save as much battery as
I can by keeping the disk not spinning, this behaviour will
flush the log to the disk all the time.
Would it be too much to ask if I requested that the creator of
this very useful patch would make it possible to switch this note
off through a sysctl ?
