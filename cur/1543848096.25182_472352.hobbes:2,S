I'm sitting on a copy of them.  I didn't send them to Jeff last time
because:
sundance-remove-txstartthresh-and-rxearlythresh.patch
 There's no description of what this patent issue is.
sundance-fix-tx-pause-bug-reset_tx-intr_handler.patch
 There's no description of the bug which got fixed, nor how this patch
 fixes it.
sundance-change-phy-address-search-from-phy=1-to-phy=0.patch
 There's a (small) possibility that this will break on hardware which
 _doesn't_ have a phy at address 0.
sundance-correct-initial-and-close-hardware-step.patch
 There's no real description of the bug which is being fixed, nor of how
 this patch fixes it.
sundance-solve-host-error-problem-in-low-performance-embedded.patch
 No description of what the "host error problem" is, nor of what causes
 it, nor of how this patch fixes it.
So generally these patches are a bit worrying, and it is hard to gauge what
their risk factor is.
