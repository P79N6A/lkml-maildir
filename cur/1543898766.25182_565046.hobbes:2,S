Alright, thanks. Yes, then what you proposed makes a lot of sense, I'll
implement it.

I've run this patch on my system for a few days now and only seen
exactly one warning; however, it's *not* actually a *false* positive,
it's a positive but it's also perfectly possible to deadlock if the
system is loaded more than one work item is stuck on the workqueue for
some reason. Say A takes L1 and B runs without locks, and then you flush
the workqueue under L1; you'll get a real deadlock when both A and B are
actually scheduled to run!
