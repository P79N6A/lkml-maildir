I have been experiencing the following crashes quite often.  In fact, 
the machine doesn't last up more than 5 minutes.
The machines are an old Pentiums 90 MHz. (HP Vectra-XU) with onboard 
SCSI controller (AM53/79C974) and network card (driver=PCnet/PCI 
79C970).  They have 32MB and 48MB respectively.
Included are:
- the oops of one of the crashes with resolved symbols
- the configuration of the machine as printed out by the kernel at 
boot time
- the .config used to compile the kernel.
I also tried different kernels, and they all behave similarly.
- 2.3.99-pre6
- 2.3.99-pre9
- 2.4.0-test2
- 2.4.0-test3
Any ideas?
Please let me know if you need more info.
Thanks,
-- JC
