I can confirm this behavior. 
I checked my fstab entry. Was saying:
/dev/hda5               /mnt/windows/D  vfat            rw,user,umask=0
0 0
After changing it to
/dev/hda5               /mnt/windows/D  vfat           
rw,user,uid=1001,gid=100 0 0
I got it working again half of the time. Its strange. Sometimes I get
the message that only root can unmount it, even when I mounted it as
user. 
Something is a little whacky there.
