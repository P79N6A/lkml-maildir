I think so.

Yes, to me it does.
In fact, I think you could even move the pci_restore_state(dev) into
usb_hcd_pci_resume_early() that would be executed with interrupts off and
drop the pci_set_power_state(dev, PCI_D0); entirely (the
pci_enable_device(dev); would invoke it anyway).

PS
Please append patches instead of attaching them, they are a lot easier to
discuss this way.
