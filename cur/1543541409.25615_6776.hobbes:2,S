Subject: NTFS-like streams?

I'm interested in implementing a system that associates
meta-data with inodes, and would like to know if it has
already been done or is in the works.  NTFS allows you to
create multiple "streams" within a file.  "echo hello > x:y"
creates a zero-byte file named x with a "stream" named y
containing hello.  If you copy, move, rename, or delete x
then y goes with it.  Canonical example is x.bmp contains an
image and x.bmp:thumbnail contains a thumbnail of the
image.  So far as I can tell, the NTFS for Linux project is
not under active development, and ext3, reiserfs, jfs, etc.
do not deal with this issue.  Am I missing anything?
