Looks good, thanks.
I just posted new documentation for relayfs.txt that contains the
relayfs.txt fixes here (and moves it all to relay.txt), but the
kernel-api.tmpl and relay.c changes here should still be applied
(since relayfs.txt gets removed anyway, there shouldn't be any problem
applying this whole patch first)
