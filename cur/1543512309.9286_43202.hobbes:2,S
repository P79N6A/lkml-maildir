This is great idea. Just one problem: devfs exists for almost TWO YEARS now.
I've seen A LOT OF complains. I've NOT SEEN any other code to solve the same
problems.
Discussion is always the same:
 - We have problems: ... (read the devfs FAQ), here is solution.
 - Your solution is non-acceptable.
 - But what about problems ?
 - You solution is non-acceptable, go away.
 repeat 100 times...
