Will this mean that Linux will have a monotonic time source?
For media players we need a timesource that does not change under any
circumstances. e.g. User changes the clock time, the monotonic time
source should not change. The monotonic time source should just start at
0 at power on, and continually increase accurately over time. I.e. A
very accurate "uptime" measurement.
