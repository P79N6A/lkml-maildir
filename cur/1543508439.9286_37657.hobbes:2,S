Rumours are true.  Look, for example, at www.actiontec.com.  These
modems have MSRP around $1OO (US).  They are PCI and boxes sport big
yellow sticker "Linux compatible" or something like that. :-) I dealt
with some Cardbus modems for laptops which were definitely PCI and they
were "real modems".  In these cases it was enough to use IRQ and ioport
reported by 'lspci' or by pcmcia support with setserial and one was in
business.  Undoubtely there is more.
Ted Ts'o added recently to serial support in 2.3 kernels quite a bit of
PCI specific code.  I would imagine that this will cover quite a few
other cases but I do not have any experience with that.
