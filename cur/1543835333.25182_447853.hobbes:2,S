(although you might get some flak about using an ARCH* define. I'm not 
sure what the current upstream policy is - using an #ifndef default 
value is the most compact hence sanest thing to do, still it's sometimes 
being frowned upon in favor of sprinkling the default value into every 
architecture's processor.h. Putting the value into a Kconfig and 
combining it with #ifndef might be better.)
