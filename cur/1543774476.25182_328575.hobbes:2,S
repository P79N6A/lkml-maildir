Hi Andrew.
The Suspend2 mailing lists can be found via suspend2.net.

The hibernate script is talking about the version of Suspend2's proc
interface (cat /proc/software_suspend/interface_version). With the
change to cryptoapi, I updated the number to 16 (as you correctly guess
below).

That's right.
Assuming you compiled LZF cryptoapi support in and want to use it, the
right thing to do is edit your hibernate.conf (probably in
/etc/hibernate) and add the lines:
ProcSetting compressor lzf
ProcSetting disable_encryption 1
If you haven't compiled lzf in, you'll need to include the module in an
initrd/initramfs and load it before doing echo >
/proc/software_suspend/do_resume in the script, so compiling in is the
simpler option.
Hope this helps.
