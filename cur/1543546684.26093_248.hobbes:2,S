around 2.3.30, there was code in the kernel to this effect.
the SMP boot code produced an estimate of how long (in cycles)
a cache-flush would cost.  the scheduler kept a smoothed estimate
of how many cycles a task was expected to run, and which CPU 
it last ran on.  "frequent schedulers", which ran less than a 
cache-flush period, were more likley to hop to other CPUs.
does anyone know why this code went away?  were there indications
that it didn't work well, or did our Mighty Penguin simply decide
that it was unjustifiable fanciness? ;)
