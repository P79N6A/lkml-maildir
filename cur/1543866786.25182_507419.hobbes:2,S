In the meantime, I've been trying 2.6.20-rc7.
Things are not better, except that the ata2 probing failing results in
no /dev/sdd being allocated, thus it changes all the naming afterwards.
So, 2.6.20-rc7 results are :
 - ata2 probing still very long and delaying boot a lot,
 - Jmicron PATA still not working, and doesn't even detect the DVD-ROM on
   the port.
Guys, should you have any patch that you'd like me to test, feel free to
send, I'll do that more than happily.
Regards,
Paul
