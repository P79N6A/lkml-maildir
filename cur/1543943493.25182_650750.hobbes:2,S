The LIO-SE PSCSI Plugin also depends on scsi_execute_async() for builds
on >= 2.6.18.  Note in the core LIO storage engine code (would be
iscsi_target_transport.c), there is no subsystem dependence logic.  The
LIO-SE API is what allows the SE plugins to remain simple and small:
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 35008 2008-02-02 03:25 iscsi_target_pscsi.c
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  7537 2008-02-02 17:27 iscsi_target_pscsi.h
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 18269 2008-02-04 02:23 iscsi_target_iblock.c
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  6834 2008-02-04 02:25 iscsi_target_iblock.h
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 30611 2008-02-02 03:25 iscsi_target_file.c
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  7833 2008-02-02 17:27 iscsi_target_file.h
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 35154 2008-02-02 04:01 iscsi_target_rd.c
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  9900 2008-02-02 17:27 iscsi_target_rd.h
It also means that the core LIO-SE code does not have to change when the
subsystem APIs change.  This has been important in the past for the
project, but for upstream code, probably would not make a huge
difference.
