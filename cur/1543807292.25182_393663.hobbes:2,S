A clear statement of the problem.  Good.
But I'm still being a stupid git.  Is the following variant of
page_cache_alloc_cold() still bigger than you would prefer inlined
(where cpuset_mem_spread_check() is an inline current->flags test)
(ditto for page_cache_alloc())?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
static struct page *page_cache_alloc_mem_spread_cold(struct address_space *x)
{
	int n = cpuset_mem_spread_node();
	return alloc_pages_node(n, mapping_gfp_mask(x)|__GFP_COLD, 0);
}
static inline struct page *page_cache_alloc_cold(struct address_space *x)
{
	if (cpuset_mem_spread_check())
		return page_cache_alloc_mem_spread_cold(x);
	return alloc_pages(mapping_gfp_mask(x)|__GFP_COLD, 0);
}
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Are you recommending taking the whole thing, both page_cache_alloc*()
calls, for the CONFIG_NUMA case, out of line, instead of even the above?
If so, fine ... then the rest of your explanations make sense to
me on how to go about coding this, and I'll try coding it up.
