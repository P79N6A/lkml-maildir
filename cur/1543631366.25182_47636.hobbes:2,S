The signal/noise bit is probably a red herring.  We have problems with
the reporting of this, but it's mostly cosmetic.  I seem to have
confusing and contradictory information about how to interpret the
values the firmware reports.

Specific error messages on Tx/Rx and also the firmware version as
reported on module load would be very helpful.
