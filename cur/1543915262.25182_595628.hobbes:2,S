Fair enough.  I mainly tried to do things that way to minimize
the change from the Davide's original interface.

Yes.  Perhaps some refactoring might be required, if we went 
down this route.

Well, I left it it kind of open whether the expiration 
notification might be delivered via both the traditional
mechanism, and via the tiemrfd.  But I realize that all
may get overly complex.

I would say not (see also my reply to David Härdeman.)

Yes, it is a little ugly.

This seems like a workable idea also.  But note David Härdeman's
critique of options c & d: the existence of a coupled timerfd 
and a timerid means that the application must maintain a mapping
between the two, so that after an epoll call (for example) that 
says the timerfd is ready, the timer can be manipulated using
the corresponding timerfd.  This isn't IMO a fatal flaw, but
it does make the API a little more clumsy.
Cheers,
