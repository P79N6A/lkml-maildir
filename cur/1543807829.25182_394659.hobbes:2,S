I have a vague memory about some old kernel interfaces
where pid was a short.  That said 32768 is also the number
of bits in a page so it is a very good number for the bitmap
allocator we currently have.
I know for certain that proc assumes it can fit pid in
the upper bits of an ino_t taking the low 16bits for itself
so that may the entire reason for the limit.

You can increase pid_max if you have a 64bit kernel.
