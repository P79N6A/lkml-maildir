+What:	sys_sysctl
+When:	January 2007
+Why:	The same information is available through /proc/sys and that is the
+	interface user space prefers to use. And there do not appear to be
+	any existing user in user space of sys_sysctl.  The additional
+	maintenance overhead of keeping a set of binary names gets
+	in the way of doing a good job of maintaining this interface.
