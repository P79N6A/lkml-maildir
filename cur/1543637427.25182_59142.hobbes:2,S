No. For VLB the CMD640 has a somewhat different configuration method.
See the source. ;) We really should be using pci_write_config_* and
create vlb_write_config_* in CMD640 for the VLB accesses, panic() in
case we have a PCI system that uses BIOS and we found a CMD640, and
remove the duplicate PCI conf1 and PCI conf2 code from cmd640.c
