Subject: [2.6.12-rc2][suspend] Suspending Thinkpad: drive bay light in S3 mode stays on

I notice in Linux and in XP the drive bay light
remains on while the laptop is in suspend-to-RAM. I
know the ACPI  thinkpad extras added to the kernel
recently can turn this off. I wonder if we can/or need
to write hooks to turn the light off so to conserve
power when we're in S3
Thoughts?
Shawn.
