 From the intel manual
0F 1F /0 NOP
The multi-byte form of NOP is available on processors with model encoding:
• CPUID.01H.EAX[Bytes 11:8] = 0110B or 1111B
The multi-byte NOP instruction does not alter the content of a register 
and will not
issue a memory operation. The instruction’s operation is the same in 
non-64-bit
modes and 64-bit mode.
