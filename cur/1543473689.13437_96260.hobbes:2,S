So as to not be rude,
I tried 2.2.0pre[1,2].  Pre1 SMP would only find one of my cpu's:-(  I posted a
report.  I then tried pre2 when it became available.  I get the following panic
at boot:
Partition check:
 hda: unknown partition table
 hdb: unknown partition table
NTFS version 980101
attempt to access past end of device
03:01: rw=0, want=2, limit=0
EXT@-fs: unable to read superblock
attempt to access past end of device
03:01: rw=0, want=33, limit=0
isofs_read_super: bread failed, dev=03:01, iso_blknum=16, block=32
hda1: bad access: block=0, count=1
end_request: I/O error, dev 0301 (hda), sector 0
reading superblock failed
Kernel panic: VFS Unable to mount foot fs on 03:01
I saw there were some patches to the ide code having to do with LBA and drive
configurations.  My drive is a MAXTOR 87000A8 (7004 MB).  Fdisk lists it with
heads=15, sectors=63 and cylinders=14475.  I have an ASUS P55T2P4D mother board.
If any other info would be helpful please let me know.
Pls low flame if cockpit error;-)
