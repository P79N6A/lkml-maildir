This characterization is entirely inappropriate for this list. As Linux
becomes a mainstream technology (No doubt the goal of the serious
individuals on this list.), women, minorities, gays, lesbians, and
transgendered human beings will be part of the linux community. Every human
being deserves to be extended decency and respect in the workplace. This
_is_ the linux workplace. Individual behavior needs to be mindful of this
reality. Demeaning and sexually explicit characterizations targeting these
groups have no place here. All groups should be equally welcome to participate
and contribute to the global linux and open source technology workplace.
Davide, you only hurt your argument by digressing into such negative
behavior. Now everyone please let this subthread die and get back to work.
