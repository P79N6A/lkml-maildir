No.  SD_LOAD_BALANCE is some attribute of sched domains.
The 'sched_load_balance' flag is an attribute of cpusets.
The mapping of cpusets to sched domains required several pages of 'fun
to write' code, which had to go through a couple of years of fixing and
one major rewrite before it (knock on wood) worked correctly.  It's not
a one-to-one relation, in other words.  See my earlier messages for
further explanation of how this works.
I'm not sure what SD_LOAD_BALANCE does ... I guess from a quick
read that it just optimizes the recognition of singleton sched
domains for which load balancing would be a wasted effort.

I don't think we are disagreeing.  I was speaking of "normal"
load balancing (what the mainline kernel/sched.c code normally
does).  You're speaking of hard realtime load balancing.
I think we agree that these both exist, and require different
load balancing code, the latter 'very strong.'
