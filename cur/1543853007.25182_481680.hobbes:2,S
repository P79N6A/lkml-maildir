Much better performance on desktop and X network apps over 2.6.14 with 
2.6.18 and above kernels.  I have not done extensive
tests yet, but looks a lot better with the desktop stuff.  
The hashing for 16 protocols works great.   So I take it VLAN support is 
relegated to low level drivers in this archtiecture now?
