Besides: when I want a crash dump, I want to dump the system state as of
the moment it crashed and not as of $RANDOM_STUFF later, well-intentioned
or not.
Let's reset the devices to a known state from within that kernel. If it
can't do that for some reason, it should reboot the system through the
BIOS (which had better be able to do it), and we're no worse off than
before.
