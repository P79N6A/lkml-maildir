The ppa driver (older Zip drives) complained the same, it doesn't
anymore. Has it been fixed or somebody just papered over the compilation
problem?  (The point is moot for me anyway, the Zip drive just scribbles
over the disks on writing and hangs with the selection of kernels I've
tried; and the 2.3.x kernels have problems with init_task_union not being
defined for the SCSI modules)
