Make it an arbitrary length bitfield with a defined byte order (little
endian, probably). Bits at offsets greater than the length of the
bitfield are defined to be zero. If the kernel encounters a set bit that
it doesn't recognizes, fail with EPERM. If userspace attempts to set a
bit that the kernel doesn't recognize, fail with EINVAL.
It's extensible (as new capability bits are added, the length of the
bitfield grows), backward compatible (as long as there are no unknown
bits set, it'll still work) and secure (if an unknown bit is set, the
kernel fails immediately, so there's no chance of a "secure" app running
with less privileges than it expects and opening up a security hole).
OTOH, everybody seems to have moved from capability-based security
models on to TE/RBAC-based security models, so maybe this isn't worth
the effort?
