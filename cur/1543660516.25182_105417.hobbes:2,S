And when it happened the first time, you didn't bother to tell
me?  Why?  So you could act slighted later?
If you really care to have an update *stick* to a piece of externally
maintained software, pass your changes through the maintainer.  That is
only reasonable.
There have been lots of changes to the driver that I have merged back
manually and lots that I have tossed as incorrect and should never have
been accepted by Linus in the first place.  In your case, the change was
small *and* incomplete (you didn't update the aic79xx driver), so it was
missed during a few of my merges.  If you had simply bothered to send me
email when you submitted the change to Linus (you seem to know my email
address and that I maintain the driver) both drivers would have had this
change long ago.
And yes, both drivers, as of this drop, now include asm/io.h.
