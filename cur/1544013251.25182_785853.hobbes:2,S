Hum...  I grepped my hal and hal-info packages but haven't found any
scripts using `sg_*'. I'm using hal package 0.5.11-6 from Debian
testing.
Now I know 3 methods supposed can be used to shut the device:
1. (Alan Stern said Windows use this) cut the USB port's power
2. send STOP SCSI command to stop it
3. put it into suspend mode
For the 1st method I have no much experience with Windows so I can't
verify. But now I doubt it. Since there are many early USB devices
that still show light on after you "safely remove" it from Windows. I
guess the power is still supplied but the device is send a command to
be shutdown or suspended.
For the 2nd and 3rd methods, I don't know which one is better, hope
some experts can give advice.
Whatever, I think the suspend mode is a standard USB design and the
kernel should support it by default so we should enable
CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND.
