+What:   Compaq touchscreen device emulation
+When:   March 2007
+Files:  drivers/input/tsdev.c
+Why:    The code says it was obsolete when it was written in 2001.
+	tslib is a userspace library which does anything tsdev can do and 
+	much more besides in userspace where this code belongs. There is no 
+	longer any need for tsdev and applications should have converted to 
+	use tslib by now.
+	The name "tsdev" is also extremely confusing and lots of people have 
+	it loaded when they don't need/use it.
