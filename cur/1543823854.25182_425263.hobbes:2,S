Hello, Andrew.
I see.  It seems that you're reporting two separate problems - your
PCS register doesn't report presence properly && the TF registers
report ghost device if the first device is ATAPI.  I can reproduce the
second here, but AFAIK the only controller which had problem with PCS
persence bits was ESB6300 until now.
Can you post the result of 'lspci -n' and ata_piix boot probing
messages with the following patch applied?  It would be helpful if you
tell us how devices are actually connected.  Also, where did the patch
come from?  With what comment?
Thanks.
