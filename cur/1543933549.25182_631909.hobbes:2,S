that's... not nearly usable or enough. Caches are relatively smart
about things like use-once.... and they're huge. 12Mb today. You'd need
patterns bigger than 100Mb to get even close to being reasonably
confident that there's nothing left.

and a new syscall of some sorts I suspect; "flush all caches" is a ring
0 operation (and you probably need to do it in an ipi anyway on all
cpus)
