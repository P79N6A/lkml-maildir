  The CODA-fs code is not 64-bit clean.  I would not be surprised with
these errors.  The CMU CODA team has not had their own Alpha machines to
test things, but that might change just these days.
(That is how I understood Peter Braam's reply to some of my questions
 recently.)
The problem here is just lack of testing (and subsequent fixing)
in 64-bit platforms.
