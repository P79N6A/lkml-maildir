?  Look at the code; you're not doing a put on a pointer to the
sdev_classdev, you're doing a put on a reference to it.
It's defined in scsi_device.h:
struct scsi_device {
	...
	struct class_device sdev_classdev;
	...
};
so it's contained within the scsi_device.  Freeing the scsi_device frees
the classdev (and the gendev).
