This is news to me. The last time I handed execve() a script as a 
paramter I had errors returned from execve() -- I must admit that 
this was not on my current system and I had assumed that the behavior 
would be consistent.

I haven't gotten into that section of the code yet. I've been slowly 
working my way through the code from the drivers that seem to cause 
strange behavior on my system and then up the tree from there.

You are correct. It is fairly trivial. However my point still is valid 
that the Kernel has the whole binfmt_misc system -- I will admit that 
I have recently been shown numbers that show a noticeable difference 
in the speed of a binary executed using the binfmt_misc system and 
the binfmt_script system, but the fact remains that offering handling 
for UTF8 and ASCII scripts directly in the kernel will likely lead to 
at least one more patch in which the the full Unicode standard is 
implemented.
That, and my point remains that the kernel should know absolutely 
nothing about how to execute a text file - the kernel should return 
an error to the extent of "I don't know what to do with this file" to 
the shell that tries to execute it, and the shell can then check for 
the sh_bang. I do admit that this change would break a lot of 
existing code, so I'll leave the argument to the experts.
