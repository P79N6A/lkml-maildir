-ECONFUSED.
2.2.17 struct nfs_fh is identical to 2.2.18 nfs2_fh and 2.2.19pre7 nfs2_fh
2.2.18 struct nfs_fh is a new structure for nfsV3, it doesn't exist in 2.2.17.
That structure is unusable on ARM.
Russel want's to change the new "struct nfs_fh" (from 2.2.18), and that change
is included in 2.2.19pre7. But that change breaks i386 nfs mount.
Could someone with an Alpha/Sparc/ARM compiler compile a test program with
"struct nfs_fh" from 2.2.18 and print the offset of nfs_fh.data?
