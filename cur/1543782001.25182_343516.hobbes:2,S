Ok, well you'll have to explain this one:
"Low latency comes at the cost of decreased
throughput - can't have both"
Seems to be a bit backwards. Threading the kernel
adds latency, so its the additional latency in
the kernel that causes the drop in throughput. Do
you mean that kernel performance has been
sacrificed in order to be able to service other
threads more quickly, even when there are no
other threads to be serviced?
