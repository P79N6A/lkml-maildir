Using an old version of gcc because it is faster at compiling is a
non-argument.  If people don't bother using newer compilers, complaining
about their inefficiencies, then the issues will never be resolved.
I have no problem with older gccs if they produce more correct code.

That's not my argument.  Never has been.  I am against people who say not to
use newer gccs only on the grounds that they are slower.
If they produce bad code, then that's a valid reason.
If they produce larger code, that is a valid reason.
But slowness doesn't mean wrong, just by being slow.
ps: it seldom makes sense to use a single metric as a measure of the quality
    of some specific item in some specific situation.
