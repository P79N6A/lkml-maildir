Is there a reason it's going this far into swap this far? system is System
is linux 2.4.0-test3
[root@innerfire /root]# cat /proc/meminfo
        total:    used:    free:  shared: buffers:  cached:
Mem:  30593024 27238400  3354624        0   692224 15863808

On the bright side it seems to be still responsive when this far into swap
and it used to be unusable when this far into swap.
System is linux 2.4.0-test3
