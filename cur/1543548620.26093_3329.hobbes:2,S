Thanks for a very lucid docfile.  I would really urge it be included.  I
have just one metacomment.  You have a number of sections (marked with
===) in the body of the text.  Could we have those lines duplicated at
the top in an "intro" section? (Sort of like This file covers the
following topics...), perhaps with section designators.  That would
allow the reader to quickly search to the specific part he/she was
interested in.  I can produce a patch if you'd like.

I tried the patch and it works for me!  Thanks again.
I'm also going to take a look at integrating sb functionality into
pas2_card.c as Mr. Hellwig suggested, unless someone thinks that is a
bad idea.  That'll be later this week after I slog through integration
of partial fractions (yuk).
