     I had pretty much these exact symptoms on a system with an Asus mainboard. 
The problem was caused by the CPU getting too hot, invoking the thermal
protection on the mainboard which reduces the clock speed to the CPU.  Linux
didn't like that and responded exactly as above. 
     The fix was to place a small amount of silicone heat-sink compound between
the CPU and CPU fan improving thermal conductivity to the fan thus preventing
overheading.  Since having done that, I've never had the system do this again,
even with loads that max the CPU out for hours at a time.
