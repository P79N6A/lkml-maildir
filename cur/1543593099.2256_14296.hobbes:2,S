Their was an post on bugtraq a few days ago about this, it had a
list with all system calls which are reentrant safe under
OpenBSD.  The paper was about signals, and is available at
http://razor.bindview.com/publish/papers/signals.txt
OpenBSD had a manpage wich lists all the function which should be
be safe to call from a signal handler.  It might be a nice
place to start.  You should only look at those from section 2
of course.
