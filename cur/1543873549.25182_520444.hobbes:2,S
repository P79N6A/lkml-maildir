I can see where this would.  Now I do have a concern that proc_set_tty.
With my current foggy recollections of the semantics of how SIGHUP is
sent I think both callers of proc_set_tty are buggy.  We steal away
the tty and don't send SIGHUP to the old users of the tty.
For flush_unauthorized files making that case looks fairly easy.
For tiocsctty this it looks more difficult.
I need to carefully read through what the rules are again to be certain.
There are legitimate cases for not sending SIGHUP.

Yes.  I think that is the last vestiges of a recent tty layer debugging
session.  The code is 8 dec 2006, and came in when we started testing
for NULL and making a NULL tty there harmless.
I remember walking through disassociate_ctty several months ago and
not finding any bugs, but I might look again.
So anyway I almost have this.
