To be fair Intel have made it possible to pull this out into processor
control with ACPI. ACPI isnt the greatest bit of design I've ever seen (not

The BIOS vendors duely decided that the problem was one they didnt mind
having, and it saved code. Especially anyone still doing APM support where
SMI is the only sane implementation approach
