Most likely, yes.

Sure. queue_nr_requests is the total number of free request slots per
queue. There are queue_nr_requests / 2 free slots for READ and WRITE.
Each request can be anywhere from fs block size and up to 127kB of data
per default. batch only matters once the request free list has been
depleted. In order to give the elevator some input to work with, we free
request slots in batches of 'batch' to get decent merging etc. That's
why numbers bigger than ~ 32 would not be such a good idea and only add
to bad latency.

It still favors reads, take a look at the initial sequence numbers given
to reads and writes. We use to favor reads in the request slots too --
you could try and change the blk_init_freelist split so that you get a
1/3 - 2/3 ratio between WRITE's and READ's and see if that makes the
system more smooth.

Indeed it is.
