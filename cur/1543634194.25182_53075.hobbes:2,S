Mainly I was arguing from.  
- Make the common case fast.
- The common case is write-back.
- AGP is not the common case.
- AGP has performance limitations.

Cache coherency is tricky, so there is some argument there.

I hadn't thought of the snooping from the AGP side, but even then given
that the AGP aperture is a fixed region it would probably work to just
have a fixed snoop on the AGP region, and only do something when AGP
traffic comes in.  Though I will buy the argument it may not be
possible to do it at full performance unless the AGP card knows
something about cache coherency.  Though mostly I suspect it is a cost
tradeoff issue.
If the area is purely uncacheable, then writing to that area cannot go
at full memory speed.  So we should at the very least mark the region
as write-combining.  This should be get the cpu putting data in there
at about 1400MB/s with PC2100, and moving data there just short of
2100MB/s.  This doesn't help directly AGP performance, but it does
allow the cpu to spend it's cycles on more important things, much
sooner.
I don't believe there is a memory caching attribute that would get the
data copy from the AGP aperture sped up except write-back.  Which is
where I guess video capture comes in.
