I want to chime in here and let you know that I've experienced
something similar.
I'm using CFQ as my default I/O schedular.
Since 2.6.18-git<something_I'm_not_sure_of> I've experienced that when
doing heavy (or even not so heave) disk I/O my system gets very
sluggish. Observable by the fact that my mouse pointer in X "jumps"
which it never did before, and switching windows I can see the new
window repaint slowly whereas earlier it would just snap onto the
screen.

This is quite unreliable, but I *seem* to have observed a slightly
higher overall memory use for my system since 2.6.18+ as well as the
software interrupt rate (as observable by 'top' oscilating between 1.5
& 5 % with 2.6.18+ where with older kernels it would seem to mostly
stay below 1%.
I've also observed that when rebooting, unmounting my local
filesystems takes significantly longer (previously just a second or
two, recently up to a minute or not at all, that is, the system just
hangs) - may or may not be related to this.
<serious hand-waving disabled>
In any case, disk I/O seems to have a large negative impact on system
performance recently compared to pre-2.6.18* kernels.
