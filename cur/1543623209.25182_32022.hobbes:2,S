	Seem that the runix.ro is dead for good, but the beauty of GPL is that
we still a FAST mirror:
ftp://web1.redwave.net/pub/mips/
with the most important pieces, and that was mirrored after:
 
http://www.stampede.org/~lethal/mips/
 ( the binary stuff is in ./notdocs but there are also a lot of MIPS
interesing things)
not to mention that there is a live site at:
http://playstation2-linux.com/
where you can meet people with same interests.

P.S. On 
ftp://web1.redwave.net/pub/
 there is also a mirror for Linux
Mandrake for all arch and hopefully soon a mirror for kernel !!!
