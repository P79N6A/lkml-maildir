I admit it would be interesting at the very least.  But, using that
definition, we haven't done any good virtualization in Linux that I can
think of.  Besides some vague ranting I heard about zSeries (the real
IBM mainframes) I can't think of anything that does this today.
I don think any of Solaris containers, ppc64 LPARs, Xen, UML, or
vservers can recurse.  
Can you think of any?
