Hmm.  The problem here is that there is a nontrivial probability that a 
packet can pass both ethernet and TCP checksums and still not be right, 
given the gigantic volumes of data that iSCSI is intended to be used with. 
Back up a 100 terabyte array and it's more than 1%, back of the envelope.
Ethernet and TCP were both designed to be cheap to evaluate, not the 
absolute last word in integrity.  There is a move underway to provide an 
optional stronger TCP digest for IPv6, and if used with that then there is 
no need for the iSCSI digest.  Otherwise, well, play dice with the data. 
Loaded in your favour, but still dice.
