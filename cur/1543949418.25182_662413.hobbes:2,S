Yeah, that's what I was saying.  You end up breaking one of the two
assumptions.  As sglist is getting modified for any driver if it has DMA
alignment set, whether rq->data_len is adjusted together or not, sglist
and data_len usages have to be audited.

Right, I missed you added extra_len in libata and IDE isn't using block
layer stuff yet.

Whether rq->data_len stays with requested data buffer size or sum(sg), I
think we need to separate out padding from address alignment; otherwise,
we'll have to audit every block driver to make sure they can deal with
extended sglist no matter which value rq->data_len ends up indicating.
If padding is applied iff explicitly requested, rq->data_len indicates
matters only to the drivers which want to see the data length adjusted,
so most of the problems go away.
