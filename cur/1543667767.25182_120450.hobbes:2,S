Well, I still don't really know what TSCs actually are (or what TSC
stands for).
The only suspect in that case would be the amd76x_pm.o kernel module
which I am admittedly using. It saves about 90Watts of power when the
machine is idle...
I'll check what happens when the system boots without amd76x_pm.
Will report back tomorrow.
Thanks to all for keeping the suggestions going!
