Heh, you don't _have_ to use all of the flexibility in debugfs if you
don't want to do so.  Why not create a simple debugfs wrapper function
(like the ones already present) to create the file in the format that
you wish to have it in?  I'd be glad to accept such a patch.
And yes, I think LTT should be using debugfs, as that is exactly what it
was created for (debugging stuff.)
thanks,
