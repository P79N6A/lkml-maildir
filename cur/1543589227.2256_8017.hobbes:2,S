Agreed. However, with current growing memory sizes, people are
suggesting: "I ran with 32Mb RAM and 64Mb swap until a year ago, so
128Mb ram should allow me to run swapless". I disagree.
The price-difference between RAM and disk is such (*) that if you
follow the guideline of swap=2xRAM, you're still spending 20 to 50
times as much on the RAM as you are on the disk space for swap.
Even if the swap is going to be idle 99.9% of the time, the investment
allows you to say "gosh what is the machien slow today. It might be
swapping" instead of "Why the heck has the machine crashed (#) all of
a sudden."

(#) Even if we have a good OOM killer, you might find the machine in a
non-workable state.
