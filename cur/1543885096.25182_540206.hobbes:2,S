Arnd, do you have any comment on this?
It seems like the compatible types should be available
in something that is already commonly used like linux/types.h
I'm fine with it either way. I'm not in
a position to be making those kinds of decisions
for widely used infrastructure, so I'll leave
that for someone further up the food chain.
