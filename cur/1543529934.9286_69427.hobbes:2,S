At some point we should convert current->processor into a structure
anyway. On the cpus I know a current->processor->data is cheaper than a
globalarray[current->processor] (indexed addressing mode, no index*
sizeof(..)) and it's also automatically in seperate cache lines. Then we
could also add some lock to prevent rescheduling from the current cpu
while accessing current->processor.
bye, Roman
