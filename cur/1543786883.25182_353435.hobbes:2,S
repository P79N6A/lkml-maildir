Congratulations to yourself as well as your sponsor. I think this is
useful. 
The iptables wrapper is certainly valuable. 
Can you post some numbers relative to iptables? 
Some tests with the following parameters would be helpful:
- Variable incoming packet rate (in packets per second)
- Variable packet sizes
- Variable number of users/filters
- Effect of adding/removing/modifying policies while under different
incoming traffic rates.
Just even simple non-stateful comparisons like i did with tc over here:

Or even better when you do these tests also try out with tc filter.
cheers,
