Andries, I wouldn't call it trivial. Consider the following:
                default:
                        if ((cmd & ~(_IOC_SIZEMASK << _IOC_SIZESHIFT)) == JSIOCGNAME(0)) {
                                int len;
                                if (!dev->name) return 0;
                                len = strlen(dev->name) + 1;
                                if (len > _IOC_SIZE(cmd)) len = _IOC_SIZE(cmd);
                                if (copy_to_user((char *) arg, dev->name, len)) return -EFAULT;
                                return len;
                        }
Real-world example. From drivers/input/joydev.c::joydev_ioctl(). And it's far
from the worst ones - just one I'm currently looking at.
We have ~180 first-order ioctl() methods. Several (my guess would be 8--15)
subsystems of the second order and hell knows how many instances in each
of them. And I'm afraid that we have some third-order families. Each instance
of each family got some ioctls in it. I think that we have several thousands
of these beasts.  And that's several thousands of undocumented system calls
hidden in bowels of sys_ioctl(). Undocumented == for most of them we have
no information of argument types, which arguments are in-, out- or in-out,
which contain pointers to other userland structures, etc.
