Please excuse my ignorance but I don't see how it's broken (their patch
just fills in a field that was left blank previously), and this patch
just makes use of that change. What's the point to device_class if we
don't use it?
That said, I do agree with using Pavel's new enum that includes
_SNAPSHOT and can see that it's a cleaner way in that it requires less
knowledge on suspend's part of what it wants to stay alive.
Regards,
Nigel

Many today claim to be tolerant. True tolerance, however, can cope with others
being intolerant.
