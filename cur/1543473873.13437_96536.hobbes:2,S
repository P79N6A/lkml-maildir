Hi Les,
> Have I missed something?
Yes, your patch is completely broken, ouch!  It suppresses the error
and generates incorrect TCL code.
Suppose you write this code:
    mainmenu_name "Test Configuration File"
    mainmenu_option next_comment
    comment 'Whatever'
	choice 'foo' \
	    "Alpha  CONFIG_FOO_ALPHA \
	     Beta   CONFIG_FOO_BETA  \
	     Gamma  CONFIG_FOO_GAMMA" Alpha
	if [ "$CONFIG_FOO_ALPHA" = "y" ]; then
	    define_bool CONFIG_BAR y
	fi
    endmenu
xconfig rewrites this test as if the original source were:
    if [ "$tmpvar_0" = "Alpha" ]; then
	define_bool CONFIG_BAR y
    fi
tmpvar_0 is a temporary variable which holds the string value of
the 'choice' statement.  xconfig prefers to work with tmpvar_0
rather than CONFIG_FOO_*.  In fact, CONFIG_FOO_* do not even exist
the same way as other variables such as CONFIG_BAR do.  Only the
tmpvar_0 variable is actually valid, and the CONFIG_FOO_* values
are synthesized only on file output.
You can see this transformation for yourself by running scripts/tkparse
with my sample program as standard input.
The function 'fix_choice_cond' transforms conditional tests like
the transformation above.  It is a cheesy function that does not
work on all legal input.  It can transform "$CONFIG_FOO_ALPHA" = "y",
and it can transfrom "$CONFIG_FOO_ALPHA" != "y".
'fix_choice_cond' cannot transform expressions where the right-hand
side equals "n" or "m" or anything other than "y".  It just gives up
and prints "Ooops".
With your patch applied, xconfig changes this code:
    if [ "$CONFIG_FOO_ALPHA" = "n" ]; then
	define_bool CONFIG_BAR y
    fi
into this code:
    if [ "$tmpvar_0" = "Alpha" ]; then
	define_bool CONFIG_BAR y
    fi
Notice how it emits the wrong boolean test.
