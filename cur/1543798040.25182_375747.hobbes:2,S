It's always bugged me that filemap_nopage() doesn't lock the page.  There
might be additional uglies which could be tidied up if we were to do so.
The scalability loss would happen if there are multiple processes/threads
faulting in the same page I guess.   I wonder how important that would be.
I suppose that even if we did lock the page in filemap_nopage(), the
coverage isn't sufficient here - it needs to extend into do_no_page()?

Why this rather than down_read/down_write?  We might even be able to hoist
ext3_inode's i_truncate_sem into the address_space, for zero space cost on
most Linux inodes (dunno).
Is there some way in which we can use mapping->truncate_count to tell
do_no_page() that it raced with invalidate()?  By checking it after the pte
has been established?

yield() is pretty sucky.
