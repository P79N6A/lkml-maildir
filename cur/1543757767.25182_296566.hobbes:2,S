usb_device_read acquires a couple of locks, one for the USB bus list and 
one for the root hub of the bus it's looking at.  I don't know which one 
occurs at offset 229 on your system -- maybe you can tell.  Oddly enough, 
neither of those locks is for a USB device like the Maxtor drive.  So it's 
not at all clear why plugging in the drive should mess up kudzu.  Or why 
the blockage should clear up after a couple of minutes.
Perhaps we can find out by looking at other entries in the stack trace.  
Of particular interest are the khubd, usb-storage, and scsi_eh processes.
