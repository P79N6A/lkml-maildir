Besides some issues with the patch itself you didn't provide the one 
important number:
By how much does your patch decrease the size of the kernel?
Also note that when aiming for a tiny kernel enabling module support is 
a huge mistake since it increases the amount of RAM used when running 
the kernel by at about 10%.
