To be more precise:
    drivers/infiniband/hw/cxgb3/cxio_hal.c: In function 'cxio_rdev_open':
    drivers/infiniband/hw/cxgb3/cxio_hal.c:919: error: implicit declaration of function 'T3CDEV'
it seems the problem is that T3CDEV() has been deleted and been
replaced with the dev2t3cdev() inline function.  However a simple
replacement s/T3CDEV/dev2t3cdev/ in drivers/infiniband/hw/cxgb3
doesn't work because the function has moved from t3cdev.h to
adapter.h; and moving the function back to t3cdev.h doesn't work
because it depends on more structure definitions now.
And at that point I gave up...
