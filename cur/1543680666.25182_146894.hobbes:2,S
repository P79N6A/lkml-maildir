It's a bit hard to plan, since it depends on just how well the pre-series 
ends up working for people. There are now people starting to use the 
current 2.5.x kernels for production use, and indicators look pretty good 
in general, but who can tell? 
So if I were to guess at a couple of months, then that's still just a 
guess.

Quite frankly, I worry a lot more about device drivers etc than I do about 
the scheduler.
We'll never have "The Perfect Scheduler" (tm), since I don't think such a 
thing exists, but more importantly, I could live even with the current 
one, and I'm sure Con's will be better without having any huge stability 
issues.

And this one is almost certainly not a process scheduler issue, but an IO
scheduler one. 2.5.75 may help that a bit - anticipatory IO scheduling
from the -mm tree, and a much simpler (and in my tests, noticeably faster
and more robust) executable mmap prefetcher.
But as with process scheduling, I don't believe in "perfect". It will just 
have to be "good enough for a lot of people".
