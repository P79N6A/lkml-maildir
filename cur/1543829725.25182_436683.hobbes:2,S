I know, I'm moving DRM CVS to a DRM GIT quite soon, it just hasn't 
happened yet, once I do that we should get proper patch formatting for 
git,
It also comes from CVS not storing that info, and me not having a lookup 
for every drm username to e-mail address...
Hopefully Ill sort it out this week...
Dave
