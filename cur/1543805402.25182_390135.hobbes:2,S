Hmm. I need reiser4. I'll have to see how I get that into git-4. ok

No, Cpu is at 600Mhz (Centrino, would increase to 1600 if load demands), and 
running at ~10%.
The delays must have an other reason. It makes no difference at all if i hit 
skip-over on something like 
i *= 1;
or 
doSomePrettyHeavyThing();
which imo prooves that there is no cpu-performance bottleneck.
