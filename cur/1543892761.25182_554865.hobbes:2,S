Petri Helin found that this changeset broke tuning:
'Well, after going through the changes that might have had effect on
tuning, I found out the one which had caused this problem. I do not know
the actual reason behind the change, but the changelog says that it
was meant to "Fix TD1316 tuner for DVBC". But at least in my case it
seams to have broken the tuner instead.'
