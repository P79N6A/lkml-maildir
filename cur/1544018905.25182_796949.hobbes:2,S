Sure. All projects (including LIO) have own mailing list(s) for such 
review/feedback, but at the moment LIO and Linux kernel are completely 
separated projects.
Anyway, I could just misunderstand the intention and policy of Linux 
kernel mailing lists. I apologize, if so.

There's not much politic in it. Simply what Nicholas Bellinger does 
violated my understanding of what allowed in Linux kernel mailing lists, 
so I wondered, if what allowed for Nicholas Bellinger allowed for me as 
well.
