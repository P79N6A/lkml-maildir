Subject: subsystem_unregister() breakage in -mm

I get "BUG: failure at mm/slab.c:591/page_get_cache()!" in latest -mm
when removing the fuse module.
This patch titled "kobject: remove the static array for the name"
looks like it's responsible.  Reverting it cures the problem.
The root of the problem seems to be, that decl_subsys() initializes
k_name with a string constant.  Then subsystem_unregister() will put
the kobject, which will free the k_name.
So, what's the right way to deal with this?
Thanks,
Miklos
