This would make sense in case that a useful definition with a granted lifetime 
of at least 10 years would be implemented.

What if the kernel does not understand the cetegory?
Common oddities:
-	Mac OS X tries to distinct between CD/DVD writers and CD/DVD-ROM
	although there is only one device class.
-	Older CD-writers identified as WORM although a CD-R is not a WORM.

As this categorisation does not work, we need a way to find all devices 
that talk SCSI and let the application decicde what device is supported.

So you seem to agree with me.
