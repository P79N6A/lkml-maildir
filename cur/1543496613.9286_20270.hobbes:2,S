I must admit, I haven't yet found out why the sunrpc layer insists on
using the portmapper. In principle it should be unnecessary if the
correct port is passed down from 'mount' to the NFS layer: if the port
definition makes it through 'xprt_create_proto' to
'rpc_create_client', portmapper use is disabled for the client.
You definitely will not be able to using locking without the
portmapper, so you should always mount with 'nolock' if you want to
experiment. The locking code always expects to find the 'rpc.statd'
daemon using the portmapper.
Cheers,
