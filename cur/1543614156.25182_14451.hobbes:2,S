There is no fundamental reason you cannot do this. For the kernel side the
console driver in text mode already gives you the 80x25 + attributes image
that you can use to do asynchronous video updates however your hardware
works.
XFree86 4.x has a shadowfb driver layer which does precisely what you need
for an asynchronous server engine. In fact for a real life example of 
XFree86 driving "asynchronous" hardware look at the XFree86 VNC drivers.
