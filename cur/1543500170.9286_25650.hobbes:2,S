I think I've found a bug in the NFS implementation on Linux 2.2.10.
If you have a file on an NFS mount that has group write permission and belongs
to a group that your a member of, the utime() function call fails with EPERM
unless your UID matches that of the file.
It does, however, work on Solaris and HPUX.
eg:
drwxrwxr-x   2 release  nexor        1024 Jun 22 16:48 /.../CVS/CVSROOT
-rw-rw-r--   1 release  nexor          37 Jun 22 17:27 /.../CVS/CVSROOT/history
Running as me:
dwh>id
uid=15067(dwh) gid=1102(nexor)
dwh>strace -eutime touch /nexor/pp/CVS/CVSROOT/history
utime("/nexor/pp/CVS/CVSROOT/history", NULL) = -1 EPERM (Operation not permitted)
touch: /nexor/pp/CVS/CVSROOT/history: Operation not permitted
Running as release:
release>id
uid=15107(release) gid=1102(nexor) groups=1102(nexor),1106(xusers)
release>strace -eutime touch /nexor/pp/CVS/CVSROOT/history 
utime("/nexor/pp/CVS/CVSROOT/history", NULL) = 0
Thanks,
David Howells
