These aren't functions, these are #if FOO where FOO isn't #define'd.
In most such cases, changing the #if ti #ifdef fixes the issue (and in 
some rare cases these warnings fix bugs).
Since 2.6.13-rc3-mm2 the gcc Warning for such things was activated.

It's located in drivers/scsi/qla2xxx/Kconfig.
It shouldn't [1] activate any code, it's simply a helper option that 
tells whether the QLA* options should be shown.
