Subject: [PATCH] kobject: quiet errors in kobject_add
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/18/192

People don't like released kernels yelling at them, no matter how real
the error might be.  So only report it if CONFIG_KOBJECT_DEBUG is
enabled.
Sent on request of Andrew Morton.
