Out of curiosity, why not also have the reverse? since it's a virtual
device it can be done automatically and then if you want a cd you can
open /dev/cd/ (or something similar) and go through anything in there.
That way you don't have to guess at the possible ways of connecting a
cd to the machine when you want to find them all.
