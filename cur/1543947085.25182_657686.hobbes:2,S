It would also help to get the lockdep/lockstat output for those runs
so that more discussion can happen. That framework can be extended to
do all sorts of contention tracking and that is why I took implemented
it in the first place to track the viability of adaptive spins. My
initial results where that about 10 percent (heavier against BKL)
where suitable for adaptive spins and 10 percent roughly for ownership
stealing. The current implementation didn't seem to have those
measurements coded in just yet (unlike my private implementation).
I came to the original conclusion that it wasn't originally worth it,
but the dbench number published say otherwise. It would be a good
thing to get both a precise chunk of instrumentation to show where the
problems are (these number could be skewed by a number of things) as
well as the specific locks that are contended against.
See ya
