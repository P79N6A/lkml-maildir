This looks like random memory corruption - someone wrote somewhere
where they shouldn't have.
For a while we were seeing a lot of these.  Around 2.4.14 to 2.4.17.
I have twenty or thirty different reports saved away.
But they seem to have stopped.  It's beginning to look like whatever
it was got fixed somehow.
