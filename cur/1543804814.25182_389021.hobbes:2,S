The only supported combinations are distributions with the kernels they 
ship.
E.g. running Debian stable with any kernel > 2.6.8 is simply not 
supported.
The only point where users are supposed to see such changes are upgrades 
to new releases of their distribution - and this is anyways a point 
where you have to double-check whether it hadn't broken anything.
And the kernel isn't the main thing where things break during 
distribution upgrades - userspace breakages are much more common.
As an example, not so long ago an upgrade of the hdparm package on my 
Debian unstable system broke one local boot script I'm using because 
upstream removed the short form of an option.
And GNU make 3.81 will contain some backwards incompatible changes for 
being more POSIX compliant.
And many more changes I do not remember.
Distributions can document usespace-visible changes, but avoiding them 
is simply not possible.
