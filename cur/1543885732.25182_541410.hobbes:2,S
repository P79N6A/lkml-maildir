As far as I can tell, the existing timer trigger can do everything the
blink trigger can (and more besides). The driver looks like it would be
a lot easier to read if it just contained the bitshift trigger. To be
accepted, the bitshift trigger needs more documentation, particularly
the Kconfig entry. Its not clear for example that the bits are just
shifted once and don't repeat. Most people would probably want it to
repeat and with a repeat mode, it might be able to replace the heartbeat
trigger too?
