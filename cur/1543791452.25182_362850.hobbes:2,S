I can't seem to trivially reproduce this.
Your ntpq associations output looks suspicious, though. 
ind assID status  conf reach auth condition  last_event cnt
===========================================================
   1 14484  9014   yes   yes  none    reject   reachable  1
That reject condition seems odd.
What does running "ntpdate -uq <server>" produce?
Also, could you check 2.6.13, or even better do a binary search of
mainline releases since 2.6.8 to narrow down where this broke for you?
thanks
