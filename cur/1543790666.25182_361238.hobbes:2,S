OK,I'd tested the 2.6.10-rc1-bk1,2.6.10-rc1-bk6,2.6.10-rc1-bk12,I
found the 2.6.10-rc1-bk1, 2.6.10-rc1-bk6  rebooted ok,but the
2.6.10-rc1-bk12 has that problem.
Then I tested the 2.6.10-rc1-bk8,2.6.10-rc1-bk9,2.6.10-rc1-bk10.
The 2.6.10-rc1-rc8 was still ok.the 2.6.10-rc1-bk9 began has the
reboot_hang_after_POST.
Hope this help you.
Thanks
