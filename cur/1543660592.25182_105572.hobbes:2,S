Yes, that's the intent :)

hmmm, maybe I am missing something?
AFAICS, this is a per-driver decision, and needs to be done at the
driver level, in the tg3 driver source.
A quirk would need to be carried to every other PCI-capable
architecture, and every PCI-capable arch would need to be changed if
tg3 suddenly started using MSI again.
