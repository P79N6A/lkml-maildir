Looks like I should have done more testing before reporting. The problem
is not only in -mmX, it shows in the -bk series as well. The mmap()
problem I am experiencing seems to have been introduced between
2.6.9-rc2-bk1 and 2.6.9-rc2-bk2. This somewhat narrows the research
field.
I still don't know how to investigate the problem any further.
Suggestions welcome.
Thanks.
