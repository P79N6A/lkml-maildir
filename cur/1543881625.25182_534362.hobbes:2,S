actually, it should be proportional to the number of continuation nodes. The 
expectation (and design) is that they are rare.
If you get into the worst-case situation of all of them being continuation 
nodes, then you are actually worse off then you were to start with (as you are 
saying), but numbers from people's real filesystems (assuming a chunk size equal 
to a block cluster size) indicates that we are more on the order of a fraction 
of a percent of the nodes. and the expectation is that since the chunk sizes 
will be substantially larger then the block cluster sizes this should get 
reduced even more.
