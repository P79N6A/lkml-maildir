AFAICT: Not a straight-forward one.  The reason seems to be that in
2.4.x every PCI arch implementation could specify it's own
update_resource() function, whereas in 2.6.x this is all handled by the
core.
A quick grep of the kernel source revealed that only
arch/ppc/kernel/pci.c ever sets an IORESOURCE_UNSET flag.  So there is
no possibility for non-ppc arch's of ever having set that flag.  Maybe
the overall PPC pci implementation could be changed... instead of
setting that flag in fixup_resources() and later on re-assigning the
resoure in update_resource(), we could directly re-assign the resource
in fixup_resources().
But remember, I'm a packet filter guy, not a PCI geek, nor a PPC
hardware geek.
Consider my original email as: 
"I've found a problem, fixed it somehow (albeit not really knowing the
code I've touched). PPC and PCI guys, please review."  
So if there is an arch-specific way of solving this in a different way,
BenH or the other LinuxPPC guys would know how.
I'm happy to test any proposed alternative fix and give feedback.
