I don't think it's fixed.
Try arp_solicit() and fib_select_addr() changes from
ftp://ftp.sw.com.sg/pub/Linux/people/saw/kernel/v2.3/route.generic
with 2.4 kernel.
They completely replace broken address-list based lookup by using preferred
source from routing table entries for arp request sources, too.
