I'm missing something. How is that different from option 3 above?
BTW, please note that we're talking about a large set of files that
use these units (remaining, last full, design capacity, alarm
thresholds, etc.), and not just a single attribute.
This particular alternative indeed seems cleanest for the kernel side.
The drawback is that someone in userspace who doesn't care about units
but just wants to show a status report or compute the amount of
remaining fooergy divided by the amount of a fooergy when fully
charged, like your typical battery applet, will need to parse
filenames (or try out a fixed and possibly partial list) to find out
which attribute files contain the numbers.
