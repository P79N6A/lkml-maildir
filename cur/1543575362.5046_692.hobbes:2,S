Hi,
It seems that the BUG() at skbuff.c:175 (2.4.0test12pre7)
kills the machine dead; BUG() isn't (or doesn't appear to
be) interrupt safe:
alloc_skb called nonatomically from interrupt c0194b81
kernel BUG at skbuff.c:175!
invalid operand: 0000
[..]
Code: 0f 0b 83 c4 0c 89 f6 83 e7 fe be 20 c5 24 c0 83 3d 28 c5 24
Aiee, killing interrupt handler
Kernel panic: Attempted to kill the idle task!
In interrupt handler - not syncing
I guess it should probably be removed (or replace with a
call to something which doesn't try to kill the attached
process.
Matthew.
