If squid is the main usage of your server, then I guess it should be better
to reserve some memory for it by increasing its cache_mem instead of seeing
this memory wasted as cache for useless files.

I don't remember when "standard" 2.4 was last seen leaking. By "standard",
I mean without fancy drivers and filesystems. For instance, look at my
outgoing dns+mail+http relay (pentium 133 + 96 MB RAM) :
ns# uptime
  9:05pm  up 466 days, 15:10,  1 user,  load average: 0.04, 0.01, 0.00
          ^^^^^^^^^^^
ns# free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:         94180      91820       2360          0      11080       5700
-/+ buffers/cache:      75040      19140
Swap:       524656      27108     497548
ns# uname -rv
2.4.18-wt4 #1 Mon Apr 1 13:57:42 CEST 2002
^^^^^^                                ^^^^
Last built in 2002, nearly 4 years ago. After 466 days uptime, I suspect
I would have noticed it if there were such important leaking ;-)
