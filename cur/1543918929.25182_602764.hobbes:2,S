I can rephrase/repeat: Here's discussion about general usage and feature
set.
The Development/debugging of the kernel, especially early boot or hard
core OOPs isn't covered. If a kernel developer wants to have nice looking
OOPes, i bet, this has nothing to do with general purpose printk() and
loglevels and the kernel, that usually must boot once, until next
security update.
This is just another debugging tool, that could be written faster than
any of the fancy rewrites of the kernel's core. Written many many
years ago with much reacher coloring features.
