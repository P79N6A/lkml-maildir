Which is a huge problem - think about programs that want to limit
the files they operate on to a directory - they would assume
that since the filename doesn't start with a "/" or "." and doesn't contain
"/." then its relative to the current directory.  This is of
course untrue now.
Breaking the UNIX hierarchical filesystem is a very bogus idea - we
end up like NT with drive letters... We're supposed to be above that.
If you absolutely have to have a http filesystem look at podfuk and
write it in userland.
