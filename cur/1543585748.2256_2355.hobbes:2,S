Certainly that's the way the original *_alloc routines used to work.
In fact, ARM never had need to implement the pmd_present() macros, since
they were never referenced - only the pmd_none() macros were.
However, I'm currently struggling with this change on ARM - so far after
a number of hours trying to kick something into shape, I've not managed
to even get to the stange where I get a kernel image to link, let alone
the compilation to finish.
One of my many dilemas at the moment is how to allocate the page 0 PMD
in pgd_alloc(), where we don't have a mm_struct to do the locking against.
