I'm sure you're right, but I don't understand why yet.  Here's what
I think is happening; please correct me where I'm going wrong:
  1) enumerate PNP & ACPI devices
  2) initialize PNP & ACPI drivers
     2a) register ACPI PCI root bridge driver, which enumerates PCI
         devices behind the bridge
     2b) register PNP system driver and reserve resources (this is
         where the current quirk skips some reservations)
  3) initialize PCI drivers
     3a) register intel8x0 sound driver and reserve conflicting
         resources

I think you're suggesting that we should do 2a first, to enumerate all
PCI devices, and only later do 2b.  But I don't know how to accomplish
that cleanly.
It does happen in that order today, but only because the ACPI drivers
are registered before the PNP drivers.  I think that's an artificial
distinction, so I don't want to rely on it.  If the PCI bridge driver
became a PNP driver, we could use link ordering to make sure it still
came first, although that seems a little fragile to me.
