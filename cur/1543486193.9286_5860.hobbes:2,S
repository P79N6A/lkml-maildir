Sheesh, Ingo, I showed you the patch and even explicitly pointed out
this fact: the patch performs a global s/ext2/ext3/ on the ext2fs
code.  There are very few changes to the code other than that: there
are calls to associate buffer udpates to existing transactions and
there is obviously superblock magic in the mount code, but there are
no wholesale modifications to the filesystem.
