IMO what devices are boot devices is a policy decision.  Depending on 
pci_find_device() use in a driver's kernel code, or kernel link 
ordering, is simply hard-coding something that should really be in 
userspace.  Depending on pci_find_device logic / link order to 
still-boot-the-system after adding new hardware sounds like an 
incredibly fragile hope, not a reliable system users can trust.
