But in this case, there was no way to force the turning off of swap,
since the ext3 bug in 2.6.5-rc2-mm1 had filled the cache, and wasn't
going away.  Is this right?  
I wonder if there's a way to tell swap to 'go away when you can, don't
allow more swap (kill new requests), and generally work on pushing
stuff back to memory, or other swap partitions.'
This doesn't have to be the default, but it would be nice to have a
big hammer to beat on the system at times.
Thanks for the feedback Hugh, I do appreciate it.
John
