Hello List,
Before I start frying my disks and all, what's the usability status of the 
Hightpoint HPT370 ide "raid" controller on linux 2.4 and 2.6?
Is there any release that actually supports the "half hard half software" 
stripe that can be created with the bios of these things?
I've got one on my mobo (Abit KG7-Raid) and I'm in dire need of extra 
controllers ;p If the raid would work, would be nice, but is not required.
[linux-ide answers: please CC me since I'm not on _that_ list]
Jan
