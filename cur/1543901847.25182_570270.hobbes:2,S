I will try that, but not until Tuesday night. I've been here too long 
today and have an out-of-state meeting tomorrow. I'll take a look after 
dinner. Note that the latest 2.6.21 with cfs-v19 doesn't have any 
problems of any nature, other than suspend to RAM not working, and I may 
have the config wrong. Runs really well otherwise, but I'll test drive 
2.6.22 w/o the patch.
