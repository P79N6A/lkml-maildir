Well, it is a bugfix for PMAC_MEDIABAY=y && BLK_DEV_IDE=n && MAC_FLOPPY=y. :)

I'm more worried about breaking automatic build checking (make randconfig)
than a few extra bytes so if you remove all #ifdefs you'll have to either
make BLK_DEV_IDE_PMAC select PMAC_MEDIABAY or make PMAC_MEDIABAY depend
on BLK_DEV_IDE_PMAC (otherwise BLK_DEV_IDE=n && PMAC_MEDIABAY=y will fail
since mediabay.c is referencing IDE code).
Thanks,
