There is some small difference in locking in fs/char_dev.c between
2.6.12-rc4 and 2.6.11.8, but I don't yet see why it would cause a
failure in register_chrdev().
Oh, there's a big difference in drivers/pcmcia/ds.c, lots of probe
changes.  This is where to look further (but not tonight).
The question then becomes is this a real regression?
Do you suspect a problem with -Os code generation?
Looks to me like ds.c needs at least this small fix...

register_chrdev() can return errors (negative) other then -EBUSY,
so check for any negative error code.
