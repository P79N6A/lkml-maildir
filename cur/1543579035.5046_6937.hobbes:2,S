Which compiler will compile the 2.4.1-preX series? Since 2.4.0, my
GCC 2.95.2 patched with PGCC 2.95.3 (which creates pgcc-2.95.2) refuses
to compile any versions after this. Which is the next stable and binary
compatable compiler?
Anyone have any suggestions? I dont wish to use the development
GCC 2.96/2.97 because they will break my binary compatability with
pgcc-2.95.2/3.
Thanks,
Shawn Starr.
