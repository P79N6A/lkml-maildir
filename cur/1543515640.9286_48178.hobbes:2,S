Not true.  This is an SMP machine, and you can have a level triggered
interrupt go permanently active and not make the machine hang.  It gives you a
good idea how many empty interrupts per second your machine can handle (you
end up loosing one processor more or less BTW).

No, it's not.  It's obvious that there aren't any other drivers attached to
the process, it isn't obvious at all that the wiring on the motherboard is
only linking that one device to that interrupt though.

The only thing that strobes an interrupt in all the time I've been dealing
with hardware devices is a clock interrupt or some serial interrupt
controllers that have timer based interrupts.  But even then, they all require
that a driver turn them off, so the answer to your question about without
feedback from a driver is no.

It won't do any good.  There aren't any interrupt sources on the aic7xxx cards
that my driver doesn't handle.  Besides, in a later email on the list you see
that when the machine is switched to MPS-1.1 mode, then the aic7xxx and uhci
share the same interrupt and things work great, when in MPS-1.4 mode, then the
aic7xxx and uhci have different interrupts, but I suspect that the uhci is
still using the same interrupt as the aic7xxx (they are likely tied to the
same pin) and as a result, the aic7xxx is seeing an interrupt storm and the
uhci is seeing no interrupts and it's clear to me anyway that the source of
the interrupt storm is the uhci hardware that is waiting for an interrupt
handler to take care of it.  I would write this one off as a buggy bios with a
bad MPS-1.4 table.
