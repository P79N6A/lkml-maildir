What do you mean by three-byte characters requiring four bytes to
encode?  Is a three-byte character not a character encoded using three
bytes?
As for 50 bytes being too short, many of the multibyte characters are
equivalent to several English characters, so fewer of them are
required.  You have a point, though.
