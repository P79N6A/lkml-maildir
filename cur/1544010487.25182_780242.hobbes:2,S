I will, sure.
Just to note, that I might not need that patch as I told that now one of
readers is permanently enabled, I don't know why but this seems to be
hardware failure.
I disconnected power/battery, no cards are in slots, and yet on boot
there is a sd reader in lspci.
Same happens in windows.
It could happen due to suspend/resume, If I remember correctly I put
card once in slot, and then for whole week system wasn't rebooted, but
instead went through suspend/resume cycles.
One thing for sure, nobody will fix this (I mean no point to call acer
support, this is too minor problem)
What I worry about is that second one could show same behavier.
I like this hotplug, as it allows me to test pci hotplug code for real.
Besides, this isn't done without purpose, device might draw less power
this way.
