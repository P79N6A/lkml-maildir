The mere principle of interpreting a binary flow in any way (be it
XON/XOFF or `+ + +') is bad.
For XON/XOFF, there is RTS/CTS. For hanging up, there is dropping
DTR (disable the sequence with ATS2=255 on most modems).
Some modems even support going into command mode if you drop DTR.

Because your modem is misconfigured (some COULD exist that do not
supporting disabling it, however).
