This hurts my brain.  If anything, it should be formulated as a do-while loop.
But I'm not sure we should really bother, because relatively large amounts of
stuff is broken for PAGE_SIZE != PAGE_CACHE_SIZE anyway.  tmpfs comes to
mind...
If page clustering needs to redo this code (and I assume it does) then that
would be an argument in favour.
