You probably meant the other Greg, but the situation doesn't seem to
be that bad. Brice's proposed whitelist covers almost all Opteron PCI
Express servers.
What is the list of things which are known to have problems? All
PCI-X?  We can ask some more people with PCI-X MSI cards what works
for them, i.e.  Mellanox.
