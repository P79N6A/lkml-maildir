Nope stat should return the details of the symlink
whereas lstat should return the details of the symlink target.
But there is another ambiguity when stating symlinks.
In the current implementation the length of the symlink (name)
is the same as the symlink file size. Will this always
be the case? If not then the above statement is wrong.
i.e.

should be
