Sorry, I have to totally disagree, based on a year's experience with 30+ 
  usenet servers which can be run with or without direct. Without direct 
the data for every access is copied through the system buffers before 
reaching the user program. By using O_DIRECT the waitio time reported 
dropped (400-500 users/server) from 40+% to about 14%.
Since the same volume of data and the same number of i/o are being done, 
I can't see how doing an extra copy could possibly do anything good!

Having seen the results in actual experience using seek/read access, I 
am interested in getting the same benefits from the application using 
mmap, preferably without rewriting the application to use direct access 
explicitly.
I miss your point about synchronous, with hundreds of clients doing 
small reads against a 10TB database, the benefit of pushing them through 
the page cache isn't obvious. No particular data are in memory long 
enough to have much chance of being shared, so it looks like overhead to 
me. Feel free to educate me.
I certainly DO want to put more users per server, and direct I/O has 
proven itself in actual use. I'm not sure why you think the double copy 
is a good thing, but I have good rea$on to want more users per server.
Alan: point on MAP_SHARED taken.
