apache 1.x is single threaded / forked, so yeah it blocks.  the 
implementation is there because very few SO_LINGER implementations 
actually worked in the 90s.  the method used by apache 1.x is easy to 
modify into a non-blocking form... which could be how they did it in 2.x 
(i stopped hacking on apache sometime early in 2.x development).
