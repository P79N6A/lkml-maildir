You didn't mention if you installed a new e2fsprogs.  The latest version
is 1.18 I believe.  However, looking through the ext2 code that I have
(2.3.34 only), it does not set the EXT2_FEATURE_RO_COMPAT_LARGE_FILE flag
in the superblock as far as I can see, so e2fsck probably has no chance to
get it right anyways.  If it isn't already in the recent kernel, you need
something like the following in fs/ext2/inode.c:ext2_update_inode():
	if (S_ISDIR(inode->i_mode))
		raw_inode->i_dir_acl = cpu_to_le32(inode->u.ext2_i.i_dir_acl);
|	else {
                raw_inode->i_size_high = cpu_to_le32(inode->i_size >> 32);
+		if (raw_inode->i_size_high)
+			inode->i_sb->u.ext2_sb.s_feature_ro_compat |=
+				EXT2_FEATURE_RO_COMPAT_LARGE_FILE;
+	}
I'm not 100% sure this is the right way to do it (not even sure that the
syntax is correct), but at least it's a start...  It seems likely that
you may also need to have (in addition to or instead of the above):
+			inode->i_sb->u.ext2_sb.s_es->s_feature_ro_compat |=
+				EXT2_FEATURE_RO_COMPAT_LARGE_FILE;
+			mark_buffer_dirty(inode->i_sb->u.ext2_sb.s_sbh, 1);
+			inode->i_sb->s_dirt = 1;
The latter will change the superblock on the disk - note the s_es in there,
and it should be written out when it is marked dirty.  It may also be
nice to check if the flag is already set via EXT2_HAS_RO_COMPAT_FEATURE()
so we don't write out the superblock for each update of a large file...
Cheers, Andreas
