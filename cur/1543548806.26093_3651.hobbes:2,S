Various people have replied to my note on "The case for a standard
kernel debugger" discussing whether or not it is a good idea.  However
only one person's reply matters here - Linus.  I ask other people to
refrain from replying to this thread until Linus has had a chance to
read my note and (if he chooses) to reply to it.
