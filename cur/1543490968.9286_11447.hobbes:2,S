Hi,
  Trying to upgrade from 2.2.3 to 2.2.4 I ran into an error while
trying to compile bzImage:
acct.c: In function `sys_acct':
acct.c:197: too few arguments to function `filp_close'
acct.c:203: too few arguments to function `filp_close'
make[2]: *** [acct.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux/kernel'
make[1]: *** [first_rule] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux/kernel'
make: *** [_dir_kernel] Error 2
zsh: exit 2     make bzImage
All prev kernels had no prob.  Any ideas?
Thanks,
  Dan
