Well, yes and no. Indeed those checks are optimized away, but as a result 
of using them most data-access macros must be converted to inline 
functions. And, last I heard at least, gcc was optimizing inline functions 
much worse than preprocessor macros.
There are various other things that are made easier by a preprocessor 
directive -- constructing the right data structures, for instance.
However, if such a patch is ultimately not getting accepted, these checks
is probably what I'll end up using...
Thanks,
Ion
