i concur with this.
Marcello: try to migrate from a root-on-LVM1/2.4 to LVM2/2.6; it is very 
painful.  major/minor # changes, more stuff required in initrd, "dm" 
doesn't appear in 2.6's /proc/partitions . . .
it is a painful upgrade - probably partly due to lack of 
tools/documentation on DMs part, but also equally because 2.4->2.6 is a bug 
jump in a kernel and its exacerbated by LVM1->LVM2 changes...
cheers,
lincoln.
