I will make another try soon.
The problem is that every time I try the following happens:
1. I download the bleeding edge latest stuff that you can get
2. I prepare and submit patches
3. I get replies with comments on my patches
4. I fix the patches.
5. I get told that the patches are against a too old version
6. Repeat from 1.
But I will continue to start making attempts to send patches upstreams
again.
Patches are also available at

Hi Mikael,
the last maintainer update to arch/cris/ was two years ago and it seems 
code like e.g. the config variable ETRAX_ARCH_V32 is missing.
I assume there is there some external tree you use that contains updates?
If yes, can you submit the changes for inclusion into the upstream kernel?
TIA
Adrian
