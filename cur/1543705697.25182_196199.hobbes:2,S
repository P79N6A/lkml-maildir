Ok. Fair enough.
I think that I personally would be a lot happier with the situation if it 
wasn't that PCI had magic knowledge about OF in particular.  In other 
words, you'd likely be able to sell me on an idea where the PCI layer just 
knows about "let the firmware install a few files here", but is totally 
firmware-agnostic per se.
In other words, you migth just rename the "OF" functionality as "platform" 
functionality, and add dummy (empty) platform handlers for the other 
platforms (eg BIOS/EFI whatever). Maybe some day EFI will want to have a 
similar pointer..
So while I'd hate to have the PCI layer start having to learn details of 
all the platforms out there, I don't think it's necessarily wrong that the 
PCI layer knows about the _concept_ of a platform, as long as it doesn't 
get too specific.
Would that suit your needs?
