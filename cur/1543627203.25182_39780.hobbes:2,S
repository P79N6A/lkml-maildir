It is a PLC/NC (Programmable Logic Controller) now for Compact PCI.

Yes it is  a PLX-9050. The device uses interrupts, but why should I have to 
know that what type of interrupt it is? Until now I haven't found anything 
describing it.
I could find out from the docs that it uses memory I/O and everything is done 
through a 8K buffer.
