authoritative isn't enough; think about it. The VFS isn't ever going to
ask "can I open this file" if the file doesn't exist in the first place;
same in many other places. You'd have to almost double the hooks, and as
I said, to call those hooks "LSM" would be silly and dishonest.
LSM is not Hooks-R-Us. It's a permission model.
