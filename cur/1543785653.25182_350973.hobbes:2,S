I like that the child devices are actually below the parent device
and represent the logical structure. I prefer that compared to the
symlink-representation between the classes at the same directory
level which the input patches propose.

How will the SUBSYSTEM (kset name) value look like for a "subclass"?
Will it have it's own value or will all class devices and subclass
devices share the same SUBSYSTEM?
What are the "subclass drivers"? Similar to the current "bus drivers"?
Will it be possible to have subclasses of subclasses? :)
