Fix bug in block_truncate_page().
When buffers are attached to an uptodate page, they are marked as
being uptodate.  To preserve buffer/page state coherency.  Dirtiness
is handled in the same way.
But block_truncate_page() assumes that a buffer which is unmapped and
uptodate is over a hole.  That's not the case, and the net effect is
that block_truncate_page() is failing to zero the block outside the
truncation point.
This only happens if the page has a disk mapping but has no attached
buffers on entry to block_truncate_page().  That's never the case in
current kernels, so the problem does not exhibit (it _does_ exhibit
with direct-to-BIO bypass-the-buffers I/O).
There are actually three possible states of buffer mappedness:
- Buffer has a disk mapping            (buffer_mapped(bh) == true)
- buffer is over a hole	               (buffer_mapped(bh) == false)
- don't know.  Need to run get_block() (buffer_mapped(bh) == false)
This ambiguity could be resolved by added another buffer state bit
(BH_mapping_state_known?) but given that we already elide the get_block
calls for the common case (buffer outside i_size) it is unlikely that
the complexity is worthwhile.
