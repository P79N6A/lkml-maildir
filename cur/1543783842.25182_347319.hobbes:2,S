Immediately upon boot on this system, most userland programs will 
segfault, including mount. This causes the system to come up in a 
bizarre state with the root filesystem mounted read-only, and nothing 
runs without segfault. There have been numerous similar posts about this 
problem, but they also seem to point to an associated kernel message, 
"Bad page state" that I don't observe. dmesg (which runs without 
segfault) returns many similar messages to:
start_udev[576] general protection rip:2aaaaae0fc70 rsp:7fffffb23d90 error:0
This occurrs on the latest Fedora Core 4 kernel RPM 
(kernel-2.6.12-1.1447_FC4) on a Tyan S2892 motherboard with 2 Opteron 
246 processors. The BIOS is up to date with what is available on Tyan's 
website for this board.
I'm not sure if the Fedora maintainers have rolled in the latest AMD 
errata changes from 2.6.13 in the latest package, but that will be my 
next test.
Does anyone still observe this problem in their systems?
