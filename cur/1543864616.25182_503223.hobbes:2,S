Well, no longer. :-)
The freezer in 2.6.20-rc6 should be SMP-safe and the patches to change
the suspend-resume code ordering are in -mm:
pm-change-code-ordering-in-mainc.patch
swsusp-change-code-ordering-in-diskc.patch
swsusp-change-code-order-in-diskc-fix.patch
swsusp-change-code-ordering-in-userc.patch
swsusp-change-code-ordering-in-userc-sanity.patch
swsusp-change-pm_ops-handling-by-userland-interface.patch
I have no problems whatsoever with these patches on SMP boxes and if anyone
has, please let me know.
Greetings,
Rafael
