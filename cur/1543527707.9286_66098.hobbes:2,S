IBM 4758 PCI Cryptographic Coprocessor Device Driver for the Linux[tm]
Operating System  
http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/4758/index.html
This includes a hardware random number generator.  I need to get off my
butt and finish the i810_rng updates, so that we can take it, and this
IBM driver, and make sure that hardware crypto devices have a sane and
stable Linux kernel interface...
