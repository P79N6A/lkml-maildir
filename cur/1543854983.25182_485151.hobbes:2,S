Hello there,
I just tried to compile Linux kernel 2.6.18.3 with the Intel C
C compiler.
The compiler said
kernel/sys.c(993): remark #593: variable "new_ruid" was set but never used
The source code is
    int old_ruid, old_suid, new_ruid, new_suid;
I have checked the source code and I agree with the compiler.
Suggest delete local variable.
Regards
David Binderman
