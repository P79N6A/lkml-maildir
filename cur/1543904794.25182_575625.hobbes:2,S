Subject: [PATCH/RFC] Add MM_DEAD flag to struct mm_struct #3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/27/49

Some architectures like sparc can do useful optimizations when knowing
that an entire MM is being destroyed. At the moment, they rely on
fullmm in the mmu_gather structure. However, that doesn't always work
out very well with some of the changes we are doing. Among other things,
the TLB flushing on sparc64 is done using per-CPU tracking data, making
the batch not per-CPU will break that link.
So instead, we add a new flag to struct mm_struct that indicates that
the mm is going away, for those archs to use. It also allows to use it
in situations (such as PTE ops) where the batch isn't accessible (or
there is no batch)

And because I really have shit in my eyes today, here's a version that
doesn't use a bit already used for something else... yuck. 
Thanks David !
