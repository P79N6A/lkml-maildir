No, that's not so (any more).  I have a vague recollection that it used
to be a long time ago, but (from the e2fsck man page) :
	-s	This  option  will byte-swap the filesystem so that
		it is using  the  normalized,  standard  byte-order
		(which  is i386 or little endian).
I think if there were a missing little-endian conversion anywhere,
someone would have already found it by now since it is in use on
Sparcs, UltraSparcs, MIPS, PPC and m68k based machines, all of which
are big-endian.
Have you checked your cables are okay?  A friend of mine lost a lot
of data once when his scsi cable lost one wire..
