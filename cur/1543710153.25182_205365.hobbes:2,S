I like the idea!
I keep many hard-linked kernel trees, and local version management is
done by "cp -rl" to make new trees and then change a few files in
those trees, compile, test etc.  To prevent changes in one tree
accidentally affecting other trees, I "chmod -R a-r" all but the tree
I'm currently working on.
Thats works quite nicely, but it'd be even nicer to not need the
"chmod", and just be confident that writes won't clobber files in
another tree by accident.
