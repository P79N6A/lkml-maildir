Hi all !
Not really sure this is a kernel, or a netfilter issue, but posting anyway.
After trying to determine the 'overhead' of my ipsec traffic, I hit a 
rather annoying 'feature'.
(Using racoon ipsec with default debian-kernels 2.6.x kernels, but issue 
was with 2.4 as well if i remember correctly.)
Traffic on the outgoing interface (eth0) shows both the encapsulated as 
well as the non-encapsulated packets.

Using default tools a la 'iptraf' count them both, so it would look like 
my adsl-line is doing 11Mbit :)
Is there any way to prevent the kernel from showing the data inside the 
tunnel ? (172.20.40.45 <> 10.136.100.1 is the tunneled traffic).
bye,
Chris
