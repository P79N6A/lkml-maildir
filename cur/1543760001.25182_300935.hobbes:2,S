With periodic balancer, moved tasks will not be actively running
and by the time it gets a cpu slot, it will most probably be on the
correct cpu (though "most probably" is the key word here ;-)

With active_load_balance, we will be moving the currently running
process. So obviously if we can move in one single step, that will be nice.
I agree with the complexity part though. And it will become more complex
with upcoming dual-core requirements.
