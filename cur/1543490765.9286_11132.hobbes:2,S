Thanks for the replies on my modutils whine.
2.2.2pre-5 seems to be working with 2.2.3 kernel/modules.
I don't have cc1plus, so I elided the c++ checks from configure and the
parts I need built.
Majordomo note
I did an unsubscribe from linux-kernel and got a "bye" from Majordomo.
I'm not on linux-kernel, I'm on linux-kernel-digest. Still. I'm an idiot
of course, but the "bye" was bogus. Anyway, I think that's what happened.
