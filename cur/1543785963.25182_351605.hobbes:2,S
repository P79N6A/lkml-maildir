Alright, I concede.
Personally, I'm not much of a techie compared to you guys; I'm only in
High School, and I have a mental disorder
(
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger
's_Syndrome), so I'll stop here,
and hope that you guys can resolve this yourselves.  Good luck to all,
and hopefully there will be a peaceful resolution here.
