Er, do you need the value of end_pfn ?
Here's what I changed:
if ((highest_addr >> PAGE_SHIFT) != end_pfn) {
         printk(KERN_WARNING "***************\n");
         printk(KERN_WARNING "**** WARNING: likely BIOS bug\n");
         printk(KERN_WARNING "**** MTRRs don't cover all of "
                "memory, trimmed %lu pages\n", end_pfn -
                (highest_addr >> PAGE_SHIFT));
         printk(KERN_WARNING "**** end_pfn before = %lu\n", end_pfn);
         end_pfn = highest_addr >> PAGE_SHIFT;
         printk(KERN_WARNING "**** end_pfn after = %lu\n", end_pfn);
         printk(KERN_WARNING "***************\n");
}
Here's the result:
***************
**** WARNING: likely BIOS bug
**** MTRRs don't cover all of memory, trimmed 18446744073709486080 pages
**** end_pfn before = 2293760
**** end_pfn after = 2359296
***************
Hope that's what you needed.
