Take a look at these:
busmouse.c:             add_mouse_randomness((buttons << 16) + (dy << 8) + dx);
pc_keyb.c:      add_mouse_randomness(scancode);
qpmouse.c:      add_mouse_randomness(queue->buf[head] = inb(qp_data));
Noone wories about them, altrough they are not uniform by
chance. Therefore adding 4 bits from 8 bits input from i810 does not
seem like bad choice. And debate on l-k can stop...
