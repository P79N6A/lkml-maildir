most impressive; it seems the approach to do this selectively is paying
off very well! 
The only comment/question I have is about the use of prefetchnta; that
might have cache-evicting properties as well (eg evict the cache of the
original of the copy, eg the userspace memory). Is that really the right
approach? 
In addition, my measurements show that removing the prefetch from the
main copy loop is a gain because the modern cpus have an autoprefetcher
already in the hardware.
       "1: prefetchnta (%0)\n"         /* This set is 28 bytes */
+               "   prefetchnta 64(%0)\n"
+               "   prefetchnta 128(%0)\n"
+               "   prefetchnta 192(%0)\n"
+               "   prefetchnta 256(%0)\n"
+               "2:  \n"
+               ".section .fixup, \"ax\"\n"
+               "3: movw $0x1AEB, 1b\n" /* jmp on 26 bytes */
+               "   jmp 2b\n"
+               ".previous\n"
oh and prefetch(nta) is a non-faulting instruction so no need for the
fixup handling...
But overall this is starting to look really interesting!
