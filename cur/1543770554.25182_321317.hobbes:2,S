I don't like this patch a lot.  It adds another indirection to the code,
and still leaves the O_DIRECT branches in the XIP path that don't make
any sense.  If you're looking for a way to consolidate duplicated code
some abtraction for the iovec verification makes most sense, as there's
very little other code duplicated.
