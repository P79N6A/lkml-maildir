Subject: [PATCH] CodingStyle: Printing numbers in parentheses is fine

Remove a not particularly relevant rule from CodingStyle.
Sometimes, printing numbers in parentheses doesn't add value, but in
some (most?) cases it makes the message easier to read. As a matter of
fact, this practice is widely used in the kernel:
linux-2.6.23-rc8$ quilt grep -I '(%l*[du])' | wc -l
3166
linux-2.6.23-rc8$

 Kernel messages do not have to be terminated with a period.
 
-Printing numbers in parentheses (%d) adds no value and should be avoided.

 There are a number of driver model diagnostic macros in <linux/device.h>
 which you should use to make sure messages are matched to the right device
 and driver, and are tagged with the right level:  dev_err(), dev_warn(),
