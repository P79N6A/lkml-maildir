IMHO, it would be a GoodThing(tm) to move more things into the domain
of the Line Discipline when the next rewrite of the serial driver happens.
This would make it easier to share code across serial drivers.
When I spoke with Ted Ts'o at LWE last week, he seemed to be planning
to move in that direction post 2.4.

Not so much the same chip, but the same protocol for intelligent devices
across different busses -- the old Central Data (now Digi) Scsi Terminal
Server and EtherLites use the same intelligent protocol over both SCSI and
Ethernet for example.  Future products are likely to use a common protocol
over Ethernet, PCI and USB.
Notionally, these drivers have three layers (tty & LD, MUX, transport)
and generalizing this out to all cards where the MUX and transport layers
(or just transport when talking directly to UARTS) are all that needs
to be provided to add support for that card would be a big win.
