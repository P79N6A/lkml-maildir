Exactly the same thing we (zwane and I) saw when trying to fix it. We
gave up after some time. We tested it on the 760mpx chipset on an Asus
A7M-266D motherboard (don't remember which north/south bridge
combination that is)
We've also seen even weirder things on the same chipset but from another
motherboard-manufacturer. There absolutely nothing happened after the
timer reached 0. No bits set anywhere. On my board we at least got that.
I use pci-based watchdog cards instead...
