Why I think it's trivial to guarantee the closure of the seccomp side
channel timing attack even on a very fast internet by simply
introducing the random delay, is that below a certain sampling
frequency you won't be able to extract data from the latencies of the
cache. The max length of the random noise has to be >= of what it
takes to refill the whole cache. Then you won't know if it was a cache
miss or a random introduced delay that generated the slowdown, problem
solved.
As you and Pavel correctly pointed out, you can still communicate
whatever you want over the wire (between the two points) by using a
low enough frequency, but I don't think that has security relevance in
this context.
Thanks.
