I've already seen the event logging userspace API, thanks.
Are you saying that netlink is not useful for event delivery inside the 
kernel?  It seems useful to me.  Are you saying that netlink is 
incompatible with the POSIX event logging interface?  My initial 
thinking is that it seems compatible, just the syscalls[interface] is a 
bit different.
Both your messages simply described and re-described POSIX event 
logging, without actually responding to my suggestion.  Are you just 
quoting specifications because you would rather not look into netlink 
and explore new options?
I would rather avoid the kernel bloat of two pieces of kernel code doing 
the pretty much the same thing internally.
