Ouch.  Now every time I want to, say, perform a page fault, the kernel
has to check the process's resident set size against 7 separate limits?
And update those 7 limits too, causing 7 separate cache misses if
another CPU is hosting another thread of the same process and wants to
do the same thing?
That is way overkill, I'm afraid.  Per-process (ie. per-thread-group)
and per-user is a much more manageable set and entirely covers the main
reasons why people want this: protection against a single runaway
process, and protection against a user DoS attack.

No, it's a lot of an overkill. :)
