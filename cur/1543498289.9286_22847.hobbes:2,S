Hello.
once we have created a kernel_thread(), and when i decide to terminate that
thread, and send a 
send_sig(), how would the kernel_thread termininate itself
should we call the syscall_table[__NR_exit]? or just a return from that
procedure would
cleanup the process tables?
Cheers,
ashokr
Plug-and-Play is really nice, unfortunately it only works 50% of the time.
To be specific the "Plug" almost always works.
