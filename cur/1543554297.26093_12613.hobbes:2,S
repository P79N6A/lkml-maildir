The __down() case should be hit if there's a waiter, even if that waiter
has not yet been able to pick up the lock (the waiter _will_ have
decremented the count to negative in order to trigger the proper logic
at release time).
But as I mentioned, the pseudo-patch was certainly untested, so
somebody should probably walk through the cases to check that I didn't
miss something.
