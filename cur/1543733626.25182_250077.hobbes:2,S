I'm running the VP patch on a PII 400MHz to closer approximate an
embedded target.  I get a 21ms latency trace during boot which dwarfs
other latencies and prevents me from seeing any of the later latencies
when I'm running my test.  The trace (from -R5) is available here:

At first glance, it appears to be the result of an accumulation of
calls to __delay() from the 3c59x vortex driver.  Any ideas what's
going on here?
Is there a way to disable the trace by default and enable it later via
/proc?  I see that the preemption itself can be disabled via
command-line and then enable later via /proc but I don't see the same
for the latency trace.
