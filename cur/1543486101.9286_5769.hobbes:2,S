     They're wrong.  The only constraint on the size of long (and I may
     be making this up) is that sizeof(short) <= sizeof(int) <= sizeof(long)
     (presumably the proprietary-but-about-to-be-standard long long will
     have the constraint of sizeof(long) <= sizeof(long long), but here I
     AM making things up.)

     david parsons \bi/ sizeof long == 32 bits?  Oh, my, those authors are
                    \/       going to have an expensive portability lesson.
