[PATCH] I2C: Reduce it87 i2c address range
IT87xxF chips were never seen at any other I2C address than the default
(0x2d) so I think that we could safely reduce the range of addresses the
it87 drivers accepts. Currently it accepts 0x20-0x2f, I believe that
0x28-0x2f would already be more than sufficient.
(In theory, any address is possible, so whatever range we choose is
arbitrary anyway.)
