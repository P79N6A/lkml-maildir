Subject: [PATCH] [ppc64] bump IOMMU_MAX_ORDER

Hi,
We have cards that want over 2MB of PCI consistent memory. The
IOMAP_MAX_ORDER limit is just to catch bad drivers early, so we can bump
this a bit. 
We want some room to grow but our maximum get_free_pages allocation on
ppc64 is currently 16MB, so it doesnt make sense to go above that.
