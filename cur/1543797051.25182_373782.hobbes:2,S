Sure... hmm, the names timeout and timer themselves have something
vagely wrong about them, but I can't quite place my finger on it,
not a real worry though...
Maybe it is that timeout is an end result, but timer is a mechanism.
So maybe it should be 'struct interval', 'struct timeout';
or 'struct timer', 'struct timeout_timer'.
But I don't know really, it isn't a big deal.
