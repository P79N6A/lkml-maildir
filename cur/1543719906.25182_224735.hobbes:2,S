What I was trying to say is serio and input system will have sysfs support,
there is no question about that because sysfs _is_ the new driver model. So
by adopting procfs based solution we'll get ourselves 2 competing interfaces
for the same thing, just one will be very limited.

No, and I was not trying to. It is just a stop-gap measure to help end
users to get their PS/2 devices working until we have proper infrastructure
in place.

Sysfs provides all the same features as procfs (I mean you write read/write
methods and have them do whatever you please) but it also has benefits of
your stuff integrating with the rest of devices into a hierarchy.
