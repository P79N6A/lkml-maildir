Rik, I thought that what we did.
Martin, I see the code actually does it when the page goes into the hot/cold
list. I can't remember conciously moving to that.
I thought we had a decent hit on the hot/cold, so that bulking makes sense.
Then the interface of bulking could be introduced and for s390 it could internally
be implemented as a sequence of ESSA instruction.
Do you remember the reason why we ended up putting it as part of hot/cold freeing?
