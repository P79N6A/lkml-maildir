ACK.  The device is generally only used for reading, and I wanted it
to be safe for accidental unplugging soon after a write (hence the
reason I didn't spot it in 2.6.14: I hadn't written to it for six
months!).  It's also supposed to do write-levelling, though I don't
know how good it is.

Yes.  I confirmed this with the kern.log timestamps.  The log might
exclude the mount (it might be a chdir instead), but definitely
includes the failure, since there were no further writes to the log
for at least five minutes after the hang, with no further USB
messages.  BTW, after the hangs I could still copy the file in
question, and also create/delete other files on the same filesystem,
so it was not entirely dead, just wedged on that one thing.

Yikes.
