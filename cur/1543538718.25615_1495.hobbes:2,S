Not that easy, when you know that these buttons are not standardized... Packard
Bell are the worst of all, their keycodes not matching any other keyboards'.

I took the solution of creating a dedicated character device from which a user
space daemon can read events (note: events, not scancodes) and act upon these
events (IKB_CDPLAYPAUSE, IKB_APMSLEEP and so on), and I even got a daemon to
exploit them. Thus no need for keycodes for multimedia keys, neither for
application launcher keys (think the shitload of keys on HP OEM keyboards).
OTOH, keycodes can be set for keys dedicated to given apps, such as M$ Internet
Pro's keys for IE, or for Netscape for that matter.
The reason why none of these is public for now is that I'm still waiting for
Jeff to proofread it... When it's done I'll submit the whole stuff.
Andries, if you're interested, I got the scancodes for 7 types of keyboards.
