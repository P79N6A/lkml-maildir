When grep'ing whether a patch I send might break something, it's quite 
handy to see what belongs to which architecture.
Perhaps some day someone might want to put some ACPI code under 
arch/ia64 and let i386 and x86_64 use it from there...
What about some kind of arch/i386-x86_64-shared/ that contains the 
shared code?
The fact that x86_64 defines CONFIG_X86 while i386 doesn't define 
CONFIG_X86_64 unambiguously defines an ordering, and if we really need 
this sharing, there's no good reason to make the chaos bigger than it is 
already with unidirectional sharing.
