Hi,
I'd like to use discontigmem to access several RAM memories on an _no_
NUMA embedded system. In that case, does a node  mean a single RAM
whose start address is very different from the others ?
When CONFIG_NUMA is _not_ set, how is a node choosen during allocation
? any pointers are welcome !
With such mechanism, is it possible to create a block device (let say
/dev/my_ram) whose (meta) data belongs to a _single_ node ?
Thanks.
