IDA state will appear as a new highest freq P-state (P0) and when software
requests that frequency, hardware can provide a higher frequency than that
oppurtunistically and transparently.
The current cpufreq code will detect this new state and enter that state
when CPU is busy.

Agree with Dave that it is not a mustfix. As the patch is pretty harmless
would be nice to have in 2.6.22.
