True, but every cycled wasted... ;)
But a (condition) ? "yes" : "no" is preferable here, I guess (as it is 
more readable). The big problem is, where to put it? Seems wrong to put 
in <linux/string.h> since it appear to be a replica of userspace's 
<string.h> (otherwise, why put mem*-functions in there?).
A new file? What would it be then, "string_generic.h" maybe, and perhaps 
put in the pr_(info/debug), KERN_(WARN/...) and v?printk() (well, all 
those functions) in there. This means it will have to be included by 
<linux/kernel.h> but I think it would be a good thing to split out a few 
functions from it.
Just putting some ideas out there, any suggestions?
