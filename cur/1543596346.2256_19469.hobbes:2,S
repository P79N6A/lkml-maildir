Maybe, but I would think that most laptops get switched off at night. Then 
when turned on again in the morning, anacron realizes it missed the 
nightly cron jobs and then runs everything. 
This really does make an incredible difference to the system. If I remove 
the updatedb job from cron.daily, the machine won't touch swap all day and 
runs like charm. (That's with vmware, mozilla, openoffice, all 
applications that like big chunks of memory)
