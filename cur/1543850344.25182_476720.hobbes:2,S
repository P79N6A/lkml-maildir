Subject: [patch 0/5] various user space access fixes

Replacing the get/put_user macros with some __must_check dummy functions
quite a few places where user space accesses aren't handled properly.
I fixed most of these (that come up with a warning on standard s390 build).
But for the ones below I haven't done anything:
include/asm/uaccess.h: In function `schedule_tail':
kernel/sched.c:1811: warning: ignoring return value of `put_user', declared with attribute warn_unused_result
include/asm/uaccess.h: In function `mm_release':
kernel/fork.c:459: warning: ignoring return value of `put_user', declared with attribute warn_unused_result
include/asm/uaccess.h: In function `sys_getcpu':
kernel/sys.c:2189: warning: ignoring return value of `get_user', declared with attribute warn_unused_result
kernel/sys.c:2190: warning: ignoring return value of `get_user', declared with attribute warn_unused_result
kernel/sys.c:2193: warning: ignoring return value of `put_user', declared with attribute warn_unused_result
kernel/sys.c:2194: warning: ignoring return value of `put_user', declared with attribute warn_unused_result
Not sure if these three need to be fixed at all... Even though sys_getcpu
looks like it needs to be fixed, but how?
include/asm/uaccess.h: In function `set_termios':
drivers/char/tty_ioctl.c:207: warning: ignoring return value of `get_user', declared with attribute warn_unused_result
drivers/char/tty_ioctl.c:207: warning: ignoring return value of `get_user', declared with attribute warn_unused_result

include/asm/uaccess.h: In function `n_tty_ioctl':
drivers/char/tty_ioctl.c:236: warning: ignoring return value of `put_user', declared with attribute warn_unused_result
drivers/char/tty_ioctl.c:236: warning: ignoring return value of `put_user', declared with attribute warn_unused_result
drivers/char/tty_ioctl.c:236: warning: ignoring return value of `put_user', declared with attribute warn_unused_result
drivers/char/tty_ioctl.c:236: warning: ignoring return value of `put_user', declared with attribute warn_unused_result
drivers/char/tty_ioctl.c:236: warning: ignoring return value of `put_user', declared with attribute warn_unused_result
These two are because of the nice user_termio_to_kernel_termios and
kernel_termios_to_user_termio macros in asm/termios.h...
Might have a look at these two later.
