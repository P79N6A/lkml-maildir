With a song in my heart, I set out this afternoon to toss 2.3.50 on my
system and see what happened.  The result was a normal-looking boot,
followed by an (evidently) locked system and a great deal of disk
activity.  Once I got through the reset-fsck-repeat cycle, I found the
following in my log file:
Mar 10 15:26:06 montalcino kernel: ip_finish_output: bad owned skb = c7505f20:  
Mar 10 15:26:06 montalcino kernel: skb: pf=2 (owned) dev=eth0 len=64

Mar 10 15:26:06 montalcino kernel: skb: pf=2 (unowned) dev=eth0 len=203

For what it's worth, .12 is the machine in question; .3 is a system that,
among other things, is our DNS server.
The previous development kernel I ran (2.3.47) worked great for me for a
long time.
Ideas?
Thanks,
