All is possible but for LITTLE ENDIAN and BIG ENDIAN are clearly defined by
the swap of bytes only and not the order of bytes, you can't use the same
definition LITTLE_ENDIAN for swapping bytes in part of hardware (0xABCD ->
0xCDAB) and swapping bytes orders in overs hardwares parts (0xABCD ->
0xDCBA). I suppose this swap order has been introduced for specifics
hardwares requirements, it's ok but only with another option than LITTLE
ENDIAN, since it's incoherent.
François.
