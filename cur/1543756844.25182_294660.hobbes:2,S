Are the 6-byte packets carrying any more information than the 3-byte
packets do, for example pressure? Would it be useful to go for the
6-byte mode instead in the driver?
Have you tried whether the controller responds to the GETID (f2),
GETINFO (e9) and POLL (eb) commands? Maybe we could detect it that way.
Did you try to test all possible commands (from 0xe0 to 0xff) to check
what commands the lifebook hw accepts?

serio with libps2 now is a very solid foundation that makes sure the
commands are issued and waited for correctly. It is however possible
that the lifebook hardware will still need some workarounds.

That would be very much appreciated.
