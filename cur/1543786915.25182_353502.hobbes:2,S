Would "SPI slave" or "SPI slave device" be better terminology than
"SPI device"?  That way the terminology matches how SPI hardware docs
are usually written.  (not a big deal, just thought I'd ask)

In my mind, this is not ideal.  For example, the MPC5200 has 4 PSC
ports which can be in SPI mode.  The SPI bus driver should/will not
know what devices are attached to it.  It should be the responsibility
of the board setup code to populate the bus.... on the other hand,
perhaps the bus driver should look to it's platform_device structure
to find a table of attached devices.  Generic platform_device parsing
code could be used by all SPI bus drivers.
Along the same lines, an SPI bus driver may not know the board
specific way SS lines are driven.  If GPIO is used as SS lines then
each SPI bus will need a different SS routine.  However, it looks like
this is not an issue for your infrastructure.  The individual SPI bus
driver can be handed a SS callback by the board setup code for each
SPI bus.

I don't think it's wise to use '\0' as a delimiter.  Sure it makes
parsing really simple when the string passed in is formed correctly,
but if someone misses the last '\0' you have no way to know where the
string ends.  It also makes it difficult support passing a device
string from the kernel command line.

I would like to see this function and structure reference in the spi.h
file itself rather than here.  Better chance of it being kept up to
date that way.

Is there any way for the SPI device to constrain the clock rate for a
transfer?  For example, if the devices maximum speed is lower than the
bus maximum speed.
I looked over the code and I didn't notice anything obviously
incorrect.  I greatly appreciate the large block of documentation.
Overall, I like.  It looks like it does what I need it to.  If I get a
chance this week I'll port my SPI drivers to it and try it out on my
MPC5200 board.
Thanks!
