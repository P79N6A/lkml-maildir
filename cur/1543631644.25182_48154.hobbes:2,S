It is clear to me that what really needs to happen is to
retire /etc/mtab.  It seems to be the last file in /etc that
needs to be written.  Mount, df and others need to look
elsewhere and we might need a syscall (if it doesn't exist)
to support umount and root pivoting when not even proc is
mounted.  It might be a pain to coordinate but should be
worth it.
