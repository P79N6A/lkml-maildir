Linux is _only_ a kernel, not a complete OS. And in a very big development
process [1].
If you want a complete OS get Fedora, openSUSE, Debian, etc. And if you need
longer life time, support, certifications get SLES or RHEL.
Btw, latest Coverity reports [2] shows things are getting better and the
main root of bugs are _drivers_ (53%), and far away filesystems(18%) and
inside net(15%).
