kbuild.git contains at the moment 36 patches which is all for the upcoming merge window.
It has been rebased to latest -linus git tree.
See shortlog below.
Pending patches
===============
kbuild:
- Section garbage collection (Denys Vlasenko)
  I had too little time to play with it so it will not hit this merge window :-(
- Improved stripping (Jan Beulich)
  needs review
- Enhance make rpm (Florin Andrei)
  needs review
- merge uboot mkimage (Josh Boyer)
  await an update with a renamed script, maybe I already got it
kconfig:
- Access enviromnet variables (Roman Zippel)
  seems I have lost the original patch - needs to serach lkml.org
- arch/Kconfig (Mathieu)
  (Maybe Andrew have them, needs follow up)
- xconfig search dialog (Shlomi Fish)
  needs review + test
Known issues
============
kbuild:
- make rpm are reported buggy
  I have plenty of mails with bug reports but no patches and I do not know rpm myself
- zillion of mails from Robert P. J. Day
kconfig:
- Segmentation violation when seeing recursive symbols
  I added the bug but have not had time to fix it yet 
TODO items (from my mailbox - I have plenty more)
=================================================
- asm-offset useable from modules (Oleg had a half backed solution)
- modpost should use err(), warn() etc (suggestyed by Rusty)
- less kernel hardcoding in kconfig (Rob Landley)
- emit dependencies from "depends" (Bernhard Fischer)
- fix select (whatever that means)
- allow kconfig to accept overrides (Jan Engelhart)
  maybe there is a patch, needs followup
- document kernel build better (Andreas Hermann)
  just a start, more is needed
- save ARCH and CROSSCOMPILE
  requires major surgery to do correct - we use CC too early
- i18n patch for mconf and friends (from Kernel Translator project)
  is old but several bits of it needs to be applied to better support i18n
- i18n support in kernel
  some like it, others don't. But now we have japanese versions of some docs...
- use GCC --combine (David Woodhouse)
- more color themes (Jan Engelhart)
  and I would like them selectable from inside menuconfig
- walk throug the ~15 qconf related patched - are they relevant?
- document use of __init and related sections
- Use seperate sections for all init sections to improve checking
- improve headers_check (10x speed up is possible by doing a dir-by-dir check)
bugzilla.kernel.org
===================
7103 	sam@ravnborg.org 	NEW 		2.6.17.* 	initramfs problem
3174 	sam@ravnborg.org 	ASSI 		2.6.7 	        make rpm creates erroneous version number

8275 	sam@ravnborg.org 	ASSI 		2.6.21-rc5-g28d... 	make rpm-pkg broken for git cloned sources
On top of this I have my personal todo items such as:
- document kconfig a bit
- make it possible to include all kconfig files
- clean up kconfig files
- documet use of HAVE_ in kconfig files
- modern ncurses interface for menuconfig (ala tig, htop and others)
- etc...
So all in all no reasons to be bored.
Did you send me a patch that is neither listed above nor below then please resend.
Any help with the above are much appreciated!
Note: The kbuild stuff is done only in my spare time and
      with 3 kids, a wife and a full-time job I am often lacking behind.
