Andrew, thanks for getting that back in there.
mm-fix-fault-vs-invalidate-race-for-linear-mappings.patch broke ocfs2 shared
writable mmap. We hang on a page lock because ->page_mkwrite() is
being called with the page already locked:
+	/*
+	 * For consistency in subsequent calls, make the nopage_page always
+	 * locked.
+	 */
+	if (unlikely(!(vma->vm_flags & VM_CAN_INVALIDATE)))
+		lock_page(nopage_page);
It wasn't previously being called with the page lock held, intentionally.
