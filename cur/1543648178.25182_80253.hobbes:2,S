And in 2.4 AFAICT. There is a lot of documentation in the those
c and h files if you look.
The original patch didn;t two thing at once ( bad I know) 
   1 ) split the internal algorithm and public api comments
   2 ) reformat the api comments for docgen.
This result in something like 40 extra ps/pdf pages of docs, two
things occur to that there may have been some conflict in the
the .c files when merge due to the time between diff and applying, also
it appears davej passed the file to linux so as small stuff so the docgen
changes prolly need to come throught the ext3 team rather than dave.
If the later is the case it'll prolly fix itself it the fullness as time
as the ext3 team are reviewing the docs.., arent they Andrew??
