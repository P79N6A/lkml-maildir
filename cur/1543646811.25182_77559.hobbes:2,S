   Prefix length for link-local address should be 64, not 10.
   This patch fixes prefix length of link-local address.
   Following patch is against 2.4.19.
Patch is applied, thank you.
BTW, we start to run into conflicts now and most of USAGI patches now
I need to apply some parts by hand.  Here is one example, with this
patch:
   @@ -783,7 +783,7 @@
    	struct in6_addr addr;
    	ipv6_addr_set(&addr,  __constant_htonl(0xFE800000), 0, 0, 0);
   -	addrconf_prefix_route(&addr, 10, dev, 0, RTF_ADDRCONF);
   +	addrconf_prefix_route(&addr, 64, dev, 0, RTF_ADDRCONF);
    }
    
    static struct inet6_dev *addrconf_add_dev(struct net_device *dev)
Note in this hunk the __constant_htonl() which was transformed
to plain htonl() by already accepted USAGI patch.
It is not such a big deal now, but it may soon become larger as
bigger USAGI patches are applied.  We will need to synchronize
at some point.
