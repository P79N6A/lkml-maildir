Anton,
Thanks for looking into postgresql/pgbench related locking.  Yes, 
apparently postgresql uses a synchronization scheme that uses select()
to effect delays for backing off while attempting to acquire a lock.
However, it seems to me that runqueue lock contention was not entirely due 
to postgresql code, since it was largely alleviated by the multiqueue 
scheduler patch.
In using postgresql/pgbench to measure lock contention, I was attempting
to apply a typical server workload to measure scalability using only open 
software.  My goal is to load and measure the kernel for server performance, 
so I need to ensure that the software I use represents likely real world 
server configurations.  I did not use mysql, because it cannot perform 
transactions which I considered important.  Any pointers to other open 
database software or benchmarks that might be suitable for this effort 
would be appreciated.
