Thanks for yet another attempt to achieve an efficient 2.6 elevator.

You probably meant el_req.  Check the rest.

Should be print_el_data.
Applied against 2.6.17, it boots with this:
	io scheduler elevator registered (default)
	elevator: forced dispatching is broken (nr_sorted=13), please report this

It's 0 by default.  Setting it to ra_pages prints this:

Starves too.
