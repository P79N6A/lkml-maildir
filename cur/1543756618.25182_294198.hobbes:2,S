in the PREEMPT_RT kernel almost everything might sleep, so the general
rule is to not call anything 'complex' from an IRQs-off section. 
Depending on which is easier in your code, if you want to fix it up for
PREEMPT_RT then either move the GFP_ATOMIC allocation from under the
irqs-off section, or introduce a spinlock for the irqs-off section and
use spin_lock_irqsave(). (that is almost always needed anyway if you
really needed the irqs-off section.)
