Evil. Devices that are powered off should stay powered off, and there
should be big mechanical switch to do that, so that no EMI or power
glitch can make them power up.
Also thing about cases where powerplant fails, or when electricity in
the house fails. I've seen places where electricity failed 5 times a
day, because someone put 10A fuse and we were using just about 2kW...
