This would improve Linux reliability but it could be much better with
added *optional* non-overcommit (most other OS also support this, also
that's the default mostly [please no, "but it deadlocks" because it's
not true, they also kill processes (Solaris, etc)]), reserved superuser
memory (ala Solaris, True64, etc when OOM in non-overcommit, users
complain and superuser acts, not the OS killing their tasks) and
superuser *advisory* OOM killer [there was patch for this before], I
think in the last area Linux is already more ahead than others at
present.
About the "use resource limits!". Yes, this is one solution. The
*expensive* solution (admin time, worse resource utilization, etc).
Others make it cheaper mixing with the above ones.
