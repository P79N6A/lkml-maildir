IIRC, only CALLER_ADDR0 is actually used (I've found that the others are
mostly unreliable).  I thought that mips always has one register that
holds the return address of the function. It's been several years since
I've worked on mips (I'd love to do it again, if someone sends me a box!,
hint hint).  So the __builtin_return_address(0) should simply return that
register. Now I'm being a bit lazy, and I'm not pulling out my MIPS books,
so I could be completely wrong on this.
