Just upgraded my system (RedHat 5.2, heavily modified) to kinda RedHat 6.0
(I'm not somewhere between the two, with a lot of hand compiled stuff
lurking around), the big difference being that I'm now using glibc 2.1;
and "make menuconfig" seems to have stopped working.
I have tried removing, recompiling and reinstalling ncurses, which didn't
help.
This doesn't really bother me that much, but I though you'd want to know.
If there's anything I can do to help...
