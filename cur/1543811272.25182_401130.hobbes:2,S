Try it with Arjan's new "reorder functions" patch and you should
see some real breakage.  makelst assumes the entire .o file
gets placed in-order into vmlinux and a single --adjust-vma will
work for the entire file when it really needs to be done for each
section.  It was probably already broken because of .init.text
vs. .text sections but I never did check that.  And the "grep .text"
in line 1 is broken too; it needs to be "grep -F".
