We talked about creating a new zone specifically for DMA32 (ie <4Gb)
for other reasons, but it's not there as yet. As Dave mentioned,
ZONE_NORMAL should be sufficient, though if you need it physically
contiguous, that might be a problem.
How much memory do you need? If it's only 2Mb or so, why don't we
statically reserve it at boot time and keep it set aside?
