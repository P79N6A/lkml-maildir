Hi Ingo,
	Glad you like the PARAM stuff.  To answer your question,
consider the following standard case in module initialization:
	int init(void)
	{
		int ret;
		ret = register_something();
		if (ret != 0) return ret;
		ret = register_something_else();
		if (ret != 0) {
			unregister_something();
			return ret;
		}
		return 0;
	}
Imagine register_something() succeeds, but register_something_else()
fails.  Someone could be accessing the module (through
register_something()): what do we do?  We can't free the module and
return the error to insmod...
Mind you, many modules currently ignore errors anyway...

Someone could still have a reference to the module when stopfn is
called.  If you register an interrupt handler, say, there could be
someone running it on another CPU right now.
> Does it mean the variables of it can still be read/written? 
Yes: after stopfn, no NEW things can access the module, but it must be
still usable for anyone who got access to the module before.
> Can the startcall or the initcall still be called after stopcall? 
No: at this stage the module will have to be reloaded, exactly because
of assumptions like zero-initialization.

Yes... The module is still "live", it's just you must unregister
anything which might allow new accesses (eg. proc entries,
filesystems, IRQ handlers, etc).  Sometime after the module count
falls to zero, exitfn will be called and the module actually freed.
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
