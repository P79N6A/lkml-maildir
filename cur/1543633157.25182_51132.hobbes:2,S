Datagram sockets are the ones that drop data though (tcp will
deal with it via re-transmits).
I have not looked at his patch in detail, but I would welcome anything
that gets us closer to being able to account for every packet that enters
the NIC, or enters the kernel from user-space via send(to), etc...
