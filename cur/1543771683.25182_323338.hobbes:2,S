Subject: [patch 2.6.12-rc5] Stop arch/i386/kernel/vsyscall-note.o being rebuilt every time
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/6/5/122

arch/i386/kernel/vsyscall-note.o is not listed as a target so its .cmd
file is neither considered as a target nor is it read on the next
build.  This causes vsyscall-note.o to be rebuilt every time that you
run make, which causes vmlinux to be rebuilt every time.
