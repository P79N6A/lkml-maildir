Been there, done that. open() on /proc/{$pid,self}/perfctr with
or without O_CREAT was the "get initial access" interface for
several years, until the semantics of /proc/$pid (and /proc/self)
completely changed in 2.6.0-test6.
Virtual perfctrs wants something that denotes the real kernel
task, not that process-is-a-group-of-kernel-threads crap.
