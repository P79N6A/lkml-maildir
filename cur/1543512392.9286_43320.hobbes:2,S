Where the heck does this 'doesn't go through VFS' come from? It does, it
just mirrors the VFS structures below the surface. Unfortunately it
creates a pile of problems with the revalidation code which VFS doesn't
really support (it's _not_ a devfs-specific problem). Side channel with
register/unregister creates problems, all right, but the real point being
that devfs manages to touch _very_ sore point of VFS. BTW, the other side
of said sore point regulary resurfaces in knfsd - part of stale fhandles
processing suffers badly from that. And I don't need to explain why knfsd
that doesn't compile for several releases is _not_ an option, do I? It's
ugly, entangled and messy. Normal filesystems will not care for
modifications in that area and anything that will... well, doesn't make me
happy.
