A cycle on one thread of a machine with SMT/hyperthreading when the
other thread is idle *isn't* equivalent to a cycle when the other
thread is busy.  We run into this on POWER5, where we have hardware
that counts cycles when each of the two threads in each core gets to
dispatch instructions (on each cycle, one thread or the other gets to
dispatch).  That helps but still doesn't give a totally accurate
estimate of how much computation a given process has managed to do.

Just as a side note - that's probably actually a bad strategy; you
almost certainly consume less total energy by running the cpu at full
speed until the build is done and then going to the deepest sleep mode
you can achieve.

What was the original proposal?  I came into this discussion late...
