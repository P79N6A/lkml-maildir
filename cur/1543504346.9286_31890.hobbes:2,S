Wow!
This rocks, if it works as advertised.  I'll apply it and see if I have
any problems... this is exactly what we need; trnasfer any costs to the
SCHED_IDLE process itself and there's still no cost to running a
SCHED_IDLE!  I like the priorities thing as well.
Will let you know if I have problems.
