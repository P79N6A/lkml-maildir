Filesystem aio read:
Converts the wait for page to become uptodate (lock page)
after readahead/readpage (in do_generic_mapping_read) to a retry
exit, to make buffered filesystem AIO reads actually synchronous.
The patch avoids exclusive wakeups with AIO, a problem originally
spotted by Chris Mason, though the reasoning for why it is an
issue is now much clearer (see explanation in the comment below
in aio.c), and the solution is perhaps slightly simpler.
