Thanks for doing this... but Andrew please don't apply it.  The sensors project
people are working on these even now, and we already have a patch for the
w83627hf driver...
http://lists.lm-sensors.org/pipermail/lm-sensors/2006-August/017204.html
Jean Delvare (hwmon maintainer) should be sending these up the chain soon.
Michal: if you're interested in fixing any of the rest of them, please take
a look at the patch above to see the mechanism we intend to use.  It actually
makes the drivers *smaller* than they were.
Regards,
