Hi my friends....
It became a little bit silent about this issue... any new ideas or results?

Karsten, did you already file a bug?
I told the whole issue to the Debian people which are about to release
etch and suggested them to use iommu=soft by default.
This brings me to:

John Chaves replied and claimed that he wouldn't suffer from that
problem (I've CC'ed him to this post).
You can read his message at the bottom of this post.
@ John: Could you please tell us in detail how you've tested your system?
Muli told us some information about the iommu options (when he
discuessed Karstens patch) has anybody made tests with the other iommu
options?
Ok and what does it all come down to? We still don't know the exact
reason...
Perhaps a kernel bug, a Opteron and/or Chipset bug,.. and perhaps there
are even some BIOSes that solve the issue...
For the kernel-bug reason,... who is the responsible developer for the
relevant code? Can we contact him to read our threads and perhaps review
the code?
Is anyone able (or wants to try) to inform AMD and/or Nvidia about the
issue (perhaps with pointing to that thread).
Someone might even try to contact some board vendors (some of us seem to
have Tyan boards). Although I'm in contact with the German support Team
of Tyan, I wasn't very successful with the US team... perhaps they have
other ideas.
Last but not least.... if we don't find a solution what should we do?
In my opinion at least the following:
1) Inform other OS communities (*BSD) and point the to our thread. Some
of you claimed that Windows wouldn't use the hwiommu at all so I think
we don't have to contact big evil.
2) Contact the major Linux Distributions (I've already did it for
Debian) and inform them about the potential issue and pointing them to
this thread (where one can find all the relevant information, I think)
3) Workaround for the kernel:
I have to less knowledge to know exactly what to do but I remember there
are other fixes for mainboard flaws and buggy chipsets in the kernel
(e.g. the RZ1000 or something like this in the "old" IDE driver)...
Perhaps someone (who knows what to do ;-) ) could write some code that
automatically uses iommu=soft,... but then we have the question: In
which case :-( . I imagine that the AMD users who don't suffer from this
issue would like to continue using their hwiommus..
What I'm currently plan to do:
1) If know one else is willing to try contacting AMD/Nvidia,.. I'd try
again.
2) I told you that I'm going to test the whole issue in the Leibniz
Supercomputing Centre where I work as student...
This is a little bit delayed (organisational problems :-) )
Anyway,... I'm not only going to test it on our Linux Cluster but also
some Sun Fire's (whe have maaaannnnny of them ;-) ). According to my
boss they have nvidia chipsets... (He is probably contacting Sun for the
issue).
So much for now.
Best wishes,
Chris.
John Chaves message:
Here's another data point in case it helps.
The following system does *not* have the data corruption issue.
Motherboard: Iwill DK88 <
http://www.iwill.net/product_2.asp?p_id=102>
Chipset: NVIDIA nForce4 Professional 2200
CPUs: Two Dual Core AMD Opteron(tm) Processor 280
Memory: 32GB
Disks: Four 500GB SATA in linux RAID1 over RAID0 setup
Kernel: 2.6.18
This system is a workhorse with extreme disk I/O of huge files,
and the nature of the work done would have revealed data
corruption pretty quickly.
FWIW,
John Chaves
