It appears to be this patch:
  [SCSI] SCSI core: fix leakage of scsi_cmnd's
  From:         Alan Stern <stern@rowland.harvard.edu>
  This patch (as559b) adds a new routine, scsi_unprep_request, which
  gets called every place a request is requeued.  (That includes
  scsi_queue_insert as well as scsi_requeue_command.)  It also changes
  scsi_kill_requests to make it call __scsi_done with result equal to
  DID_NO_CONNECT << 16.  (I'm not sure if it's necessary to call
  scsi_init_cmd_errh here; maybe you can check on that.)  Finally, the
  patch changes the return value from scsi_end_request, to avoid
  returning a stale pointer in the case where the request was requeued.
  Fortunately the return value is used in only place, and the change
  actually simplified it.
And in particular it looks like the scsi_unprep_request in
scsi_queue_insert is causing it. The following patch fixes the boot
problems on the vscsi machine:
