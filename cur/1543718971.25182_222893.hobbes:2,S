While working on a driver that is not part of the  standard kernel 
sources, I found that dev_open() was returning -NODEV when there was no 
device (instead of -ENODEV).
Since NODEV is #defined to be 0 this caused open to erroneously report 
success.
It seems to me that any place you see -NODEV in the kernel sources is 
almost certainly an error.
Using the 2.4.25 sources from linux-mips.org I get the following:
$ grep -r -- -NODEV *
drivers/isdn/sc/command.c:      return -NODEV;
drivers/media/video/cpia.c:                     return -NODEV;
drivers/net/defxx.c:    int rc = -NODEV;
I have no idea if these still exist in the current sources,  but I 
suspect that they do.
