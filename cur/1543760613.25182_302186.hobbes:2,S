This line has to be something like
( (__GNUC__ == 3 && __GNUC_MINOR__ == 3 && __GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__ >= 4) && \
   HEAVILY_PATCHES_SUSE_GCC ) 
<--  snip  -->
IOW:
Only heavily patches gcc 3.3 compiler define __gcov_init.
Anton's original report said that he needs __gcov_init with
SuSE gcc 3.3.4 .

No, my claim is that no sane gcc 3.3 defines __gcov_init.
