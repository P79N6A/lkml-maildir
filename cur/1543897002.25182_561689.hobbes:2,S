Again, what is advantage of having this in tree? Maintainers can't
grep & update translations, you probably did not verify translation to
be accurate (and still you are applying it), ...
Code merged in-tree has to be reviewed by relevant maintainers. This
is not. For in-tree code, hackers are expected to fix whatever they
break. You can't realisticaly expect me updating HOWTO to update
translations as well.
