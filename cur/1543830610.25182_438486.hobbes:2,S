Funny, we had this discussion a couple of years ago...
What the above does is generate a calling convention with the right 
number of (various types of) registers.  Then the Makefile swaps the 
registers that the compiler outputs.  It's a bit of a hack, but it's 
reliable and works.  The resulting code isn't as compact at divide.S, 
though.
However, I've tried to keep the code under the BSD license, mostly for 
the benefit of the standalone klibc version (static linkage being the 
norm, after all); so I don't want to crib kernel code unless the owner 
consents to relicensing.  I have cribbed some NetBSD code in some 
places, though.
