i'm puzzled, incorrect in specifically what way?

what you say makes no sense to me. The majority of Linux 3D apps are 
already driven by the vertical retrace interrupt and properly 'yield the 
CPU' if they wish so, but this has nothing to do with sys_sched_yield().

i'm even more puzzled. I've added sched_yield_to() to CFS -v6 and it's 
been part of CFS since then. I'm curious, on what mechanism is Will 
working and have any patches been sent to lkml for discussion?
