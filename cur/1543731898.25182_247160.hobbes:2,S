 i understand!
 i thought that selinux by default would stop me from being
 able to copy binaries from /usr/bin.... uhn... no such luck.
 if it becomes an issue i will investigate removing read access!

 so, inode it is.

 i should imagine that at some point down the line, selinux would be
 of some assistance here.

 i'd be happy to set the rules by the "inode" of the program, and to
 have a userspace program do a lookup (at startup time) of the inode
 of the various programs, and load the rules for the appropriate set
 of binaries.
 the only thing is of course installing new binaries, you need to
 reload the rules (new inodes).
 i could kick that idiot responsible for dpkg maintenance.
 russell's idea of providing /etc/dpkg/postinst.d is exactly the sort
 of thing that's required to re-run iptable-rule-reloading like this,
 and the idiot won't accept the patch.
