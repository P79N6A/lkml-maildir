If fsync performance is an issue for you, run the filesystem in data=journal
mode, put the journal on a separate disk and make it big enough that you
don't block on it to flush the data to the filesystem (but not so big that
it is consuming all of your RAM).
That keeps your data guarantees without hurting performance.
