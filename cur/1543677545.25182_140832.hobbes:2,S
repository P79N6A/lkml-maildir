Hi Folks,
I am new to this list, and am looking for some help.
I have D-link TFE-538TX 10/100 adapter on my computer, and have RedHat
Linux 8.0 as the OS. 
The network driver that is provided is for Linux 6.x and it is returning an
error when I try to install it. COuld someone please send me the updated
driver, or suggest changes/patch that I make to the old one so that it
works on Linux 8.0?
Durga
