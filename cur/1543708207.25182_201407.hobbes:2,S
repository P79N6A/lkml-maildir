I really don't think this will be such a good idea since you don't
currently have a unified driver.  2.4 is approaching end of life as far
as major driver updates go and the 2.6 APIs are quite a bit different. 
You'll find it's a lot of work for a driver that will carry you at most
six months before the distributions all switch to 2.6 and you find the
2.4 compatibility layer to be more of a hindrance than a help.
