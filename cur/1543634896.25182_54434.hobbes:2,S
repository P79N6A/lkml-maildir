Well this message is coming from drivers/net/3c59x.c in a bit of code that
goes:
/* Refill the Rx ring buffers. */
        for (; vp->cur_rx - vp->dirty_rx > 0; vp->dirty_rx++) {
                struct sk_buff *skb;
                entry = vp->dirty_rx % RX_RING_SIZE;
                if (vp->rx_skbuff[entry] == NULL) {
                        skb = dev_alloc_skb(PKT_BUF_SZ);
                        if (skb == NULL) {
                                static unsigned long last_jif;
                                if ((jiffies - last_jif) > 10 * HZ) {
                                        printk(KERN_WARNING "%s: memory shortage
\n", dev->name);
                                        last_jif = jiffies;
                                }
                                if ((vp->cur_rx - vp->dirty_rx) == RX_RING_SIZE)
                                        mod_timer(&vp->rx_oom_timer, RUN_AT(HZ *
 1));
                                break;                  /* Bad news!  */
                        }
So basically it looks like it is taking much longer to refill rx ring buffers
than it should.
On past 2.4 kernels I recall the eepro100 would report a message of "out
of resources" and the fix suggested there was to increase the values in
/proc/sys/vm/freepages.  Perhaps it's a similar issue with the 3c59x ??
Perhaps one of the guru's could comment?
