Hi,
It is a good stuff but we probably want not only restore mux mode
but also do serio_reconnect on all ports to make sure all devices are
properly configured. But it gets way too big for interrupt handler.
I am thinking that if mux error is detected the only thing that should
be done in i8042_interrupt is disabling the controller and then use
schedule_work to schedule the rest.
Also, if we get SERIO_REMOVED condition we should just do serio_reconnect
right away and let it sort through the device state.
What do you think?
Dmitry
