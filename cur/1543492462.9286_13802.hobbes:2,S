Subject: [Q] Detecting Remarked CPUs

In the not too distant past (within the last six monthes?), I read a post 
regarding mysterious
crashes, etc.  The outcome of the (short?) thread was that the original 
poster was directed
to investigate whether or not he had a 'Remarked PII', and pointed at 
information to detect
same.  I have been wading through the LK archives for the last few days in 
an effort to find
that thread, ... alas, I can't seem to recall enough info to track it down. 
 'linuxsearch' and
'yahoo' searches have been ... well ... less than helpful.
Does anyone else remember this?, and if so, could you help refresh my 
memory, so that I
may track down the detection/verification information?
Many thanks for your consideration (and cc:) given my query.
Brubaker
