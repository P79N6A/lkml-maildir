The latter.
And yes, I'm starting to hate it too, especially after I've seen all the 
weird bugs this causes in userspace, which then only trigger on m68k.
I'm thinking of changing it when switching to proper TLS support, but it's 
not there yet.
BTW there is another reason I actually like the atomic type - 
documentation. It makes it more clear that this intended to be used as 
atomic value, so an unhealthy mixture of different accesses is less likely 
and if they pile up at some place it's a good indicator to maybe switch 
back to spinlocks.
bye, Roman
