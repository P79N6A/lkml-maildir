Not in the way the machine is currently configured. All the CPUs appear to
be on a node with no memory. It's best to assume I cannot get the machine
reconfigured (which just hides the bug anyway). Physically, it's thousands
of miles away so I can't do the work. I can get lab support to do the job
but that will take a fair while and at the end of the day, it doesn't tell
us a lot. We know that other PPC64 machines work so it's not a general problem.

It feels vaguely familiar but I don't recall the details in sufficient detail
to recognise if this is the same problem or not.

I'll roll a patch that prints out the online states before startup and
see what it looks like.

By minimal, do you mean that you expect it to break in some other
respect later or minimal as in "this is bad but should not have no
adverse impact".

Whatever this was a problem fixed in the past or not, it's broken again now
:( . It's possible that there is a __GFP_THISNODE that can be dropped early
at boot-time that would also fix this problem in a way that doesn't
affect runtime (like altering cache_grow in my patch does).
