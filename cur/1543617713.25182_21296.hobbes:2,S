Hi,
I've made up a patch that contains a new PCI Hotplug controller driver
that will work on upcoming IBM i386 based machines.  This is the first
publicly released version, and still needs to undergo a lot of testing
before it is submitted to the kernel tree.
The patch is against 2.4.18-pre4 and can be found at:
  
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/hotplug/ibmphp-2.4.18-pre4.patch
The patch only modifies one existing kernel source file, and that is to
export the IO_APIC_get_PCI_irq_vector symbol, which the driver needs to
determine the proper IRQ when a new PCI card is plugged in.
This driver was written by Irene Zubarev, Jyoti Shah, Tong Yu and Chuck
Cole with just a tiny bit of help from me.
