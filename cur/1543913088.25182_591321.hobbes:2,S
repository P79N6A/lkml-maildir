This patch was developed for embedded systems which had limited space
for file storage. If an external process is to compress core files you
will need to store those files somewhere first as core dump output
cannot be directly fed to the stdin of compression program. Imagine
storing a 40 Meg core file in an embedded system. A few core files will
fill up the file system and some core files can get corrupted too.

This is silly, IMO - why do in kernel what can be done in userland?
External
process can damn well gzip/bzip2/uuencode and post to
alt.sex.cthulhu.binaries/
whatever.  Just feed the usual data to its stdin...
