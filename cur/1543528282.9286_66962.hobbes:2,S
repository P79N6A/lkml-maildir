My system doesn't power down any more. I _think_ that the behaviour
changed since I compiled in ACPI support.
Is this problem related to the following startup messages?
Mar  2 14:36:49 penny kernel: ACPI: "Award" found at 0x000f6b00
Mar  2 14:36:49 penny kernel: apm: BIOS version 1.2 Flags 0x07 (Driver version 1.13)
Mar  2 14:36:49 penny kernel: apm: overridden by ACPI.
Where is this stuff documented?
