Btw, perhaps what is going on here is a misunderstanding of 
terminology? "Barrier" or "Memory barrier" can refer to both a hardware or 
compiler barrier, which is why Documentation/memory-barriers.txt speaks of 
both in the same file. Indeed, you often have both in the same spot, and the 
names are even similar:
barrier() -> compiler memory barrier
wmb() -> write memory barrier
...
Sometimes you'll see "optimization barrier", but you should remember that 
barrier() boils down to:
asm volatile ("" ::: "memory")
...because it's preventing memory caching/reordering across the unpredictable 
memory clobber.
See?
