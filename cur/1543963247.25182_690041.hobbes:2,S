Take five minutes. Take a deep breadth. And *think* about actually reading 
what I wrote.
The bitflag *can* prevent taking the same lock twice. It just needs to be 
in the right place.
Let me quote it for you:

IOW, just make it be in that anon_vma (and the address_space). No sorting 
required.

Shut up already. It's not constant time just because you can cap the 
overhead. We're not in a university, and we care about performance, not 
your made-up big-O notation.
