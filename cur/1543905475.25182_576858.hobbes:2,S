Sorry to use foul language once again after a while, but:
	Fuck you Martin!
not only is complaining about illegal binary crap totally offtopic
on this list, and making youself a fool for using that piece of shit
is annoying enough, but don't even try to badmouth Martin for doing
important and needed cleanups.  And now get out of here!
