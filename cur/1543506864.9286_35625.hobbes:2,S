We'll be happy to use existing tunnel machinery if we can... but it will
take some careful study to establish that we indeed can.  IPSEC imposes a
number of constraints; in particular, we have a requirement to do certain
types of checking on an incoming packet *after* it emerges from the
tunnel.  (We aren't currently doing this, but that is a bug.)  We may be
able to do it using the new routing machinery, but that needs to be
confirmed.
