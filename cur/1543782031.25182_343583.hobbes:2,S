[P.S. - I just noticed that Dinakar is reporting another problem,
        something about a panic on stress testing.  Dinakar - should
	we adapt what I call choice (2) below, to disable this feature
	in 2.6.13, instead of the choice (3) I recommend below? -pj ]
In separate email, Nick suggested disabling some of this mechanism in
2.6.13, in order to provide more soak time for Hawkes dynamic sched
domain fix for partial nodes in 2.6.14.
Nick's hope was to find some quick and easy (and safe) way to avoid the
oops that Hawkes found for 2.6.13 (which is almost out the door).
There are three easy ways I see offhand one might do to avoid this
oops in 2.6.13
 1) disable 'cpu_exclusive' cpusets
 2) disable Dinakar's patch entirely.
 3) disable Dinakar's patch just for partial node cpusets.
The 'cpu_exclusive' cpusets are already in the kernel, as of 2.6.12,
though until Dinakar's patch is added, they are of limited usefulness.
I'd mildly prefer not to disable them in 2.6.13 (choice (1) above),
unless we can't find a better way.  A few poor folks off in some corner
of cpuset land would probably notice that something that worked in
2.6.12 was disconnected in 2.6.13.
What Dinakar's patch, added for 2.6.13, does is (roughly):
  If the cpuset code notices that it is setting up a cpuset
  marked 'cpu_exclusive', then the cpuset code calls the
  dynamic sched domain code to define a sched domain along
  the boundaries of that cpuset.
The safest, mind numbingly simple thing to do that would avoid
the oops that Hawkes reported is to simply not have the cpuset
code call the code to setup a dynamic sched domain.  This is
choice (2) above, and could be done at the last hour with
relative safety.
Here is an untested patch that does (2):

=====
For a half-dozen easy lines of code, if we have a few hours and
a chance for Dinakar and Hawkes to concur, the best solution is
choice (3) above.  The cpuset code that calls out to the code
to setup a dynamic sched domain already avoides that call out for
a variety of conditions (such as an empty cpuset or the top
cpuset).  It can just as easily avoid the call out for one more
reason, that being that the cpuset in question is not on node
boundaries (for some node, uses a proper non-empty subset of the
cpus on that node).
Here is an untested patch that does this:

=====
I recommend this last patch above - choice (3).  It provides what
Dinakar intended to allow user control of sched domains, while
avoiding the corner case that Hawkes reported, where a sched
domain not on a node boundary could oops the kernel.
I will prepare a real patch that does (3), and send it out later
today.
