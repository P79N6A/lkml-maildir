It was probably intentional to not have the Makefile automagically create 
KBUILD_OUPUT if it doesn't exist, but just in case, here's a patch which 
makes it do just that. I'd appreciate feedback either way just so I know if 
it's actually getting looked at or if it got lost somewhere along the way.
