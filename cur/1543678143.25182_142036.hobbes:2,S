No. Quite the reverse. I just effectively wrote "you _cannot_ do that".  
And we won't even tell the details of _how_ you cannot do that.
In fact, even inside transmeta you cannot do that, without having a
specially blessed version of the flash that allows upgrades. If you ever
see a machine with a prominent notice saying "CMS upgraded to development
version", then that's a hint that it's a machine that TMTA developers
could change.
But even then you'd have to know how to change it.
Think of it like the Intel microcode update, except on steroids. Big 
steroids.
