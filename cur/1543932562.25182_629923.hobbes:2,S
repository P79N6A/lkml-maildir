Yes, we see the stall on the anon_vma lock most frequently running the
AIM benchmark with several tens of thousands of processes--all forked
from the same parent.  If we push the system into reclaim, all cpus end
up spinning on the lock in one of the anon_vma's shared by all the
tasks.  Quite easy to reproduce.  I have also seen this running stress
tests to force reclaim under Dave Anderson's "usex" exerciser--e.g.,
testing the split LRU and noreclaim patches--even with the reader-writer
lock patch. 
I've seen the lockups on the i_mmap_lock running Oracle workloads on our
large servers.  This is running an OLTP workload with only a thousand or
so "clients" all running the same application image.   Again, when the
system attempts to reclaim we end up spinning on the i_mmap_lock of one
of the files [possibly the shared global shmem segment] shared by all
the applications.  I also see it with the usex stress load--also, with
and without this patch.  I think this is a more probably
scenario--thousands of processes sharing a single file, such as
libc.so--than thousands of processes all descended from a single
ancestor w/o exec'ing.
I keep these patches up to date for testing.  I don't have conclusive
evidence whether they alleviate or exacerbate the problem nor by how
much.
