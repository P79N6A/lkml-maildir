Yes. I think trusting ACPI is _always_ a mistake. It's insane. We should 
never ask the firmware for any data that we can just figure out ourselves.
And we should tell all hardware companies that firmware tables are stupid, 
and that we just want to know what the hell the registers MEAN!
I've certainly tried to tell Intel that. I think they may even have heard 
me occasionally.
I can't understand why some people _still_ think ACPI is a good idea..
