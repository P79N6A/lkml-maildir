I don't think glibc exports any atomic operations.  As for the
semaphores and spinlocks, clearly you can use the pthread_* functions,
but hopefully the kernel versions are a bit lighter-weight.

No, for semaphores and rwsems I was going to use futexes.  Or maybe we
don't need the kernel's semaphores, rwsems and spinlocks in userspace
at all.  I'm open to suggestions.

Thanks.
