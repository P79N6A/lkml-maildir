I am Dr. salas tatu+, Director of Project, ghana
Department of Minerals and Energy. I am making this 
contact with you
based on the committee's need for an individual/company 
who is willing
to assist us with a solution to a money transfer. 
This amount $28.5m represents the balance of the total
contract value executed on behalf of Department by a
foreign contracting firm, which we the officials
over-invoiced deliberately, of which the actual sum has
been paid. 
Should you be willing to assist us in the transaction,
your share of the 
sum will be 25% of the $28.5 million, 70% for us and 5%
for taxation and 
miscelleneous expenses.
I await your immediate response.
Yours faithfully,
Dr. salas tatu.
