Subject: [PATCH] x86: resolve hidden patch conflict in arch/x86/kernel/cpu/perfctr-watchdog.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

There apparently was an unnoticed conflict between an earlier patch to
this file and mine (d1e084746b0e5806e6345ab31c5b370f8dee2b23), which
I noticed only now. I suppose a change like the one below (untested) is
needed; I didn't get any response on a confirmation request for this from
the submitter of the first patch.
The issue is the writing of the 'checkbit' member at the end of
setup_intel_arch_watchdog(), which my patch made go to intel_arch_wd_ops
rather than wd_ops.
