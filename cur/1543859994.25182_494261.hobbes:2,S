Still trying to catch up here, so I'm not going to reply to any old
stuff and just start at the tip of the thread... Other than to say
that I really like cancel_page_dirty ;)
I think your patch is quite right so that's a good catch. But I'm not
too surprised that it does not help the problem, because I don't
think we have started shedding any old pte_dirty tests at
unmap/reclaim-time, have we? So the dirty bit isn't going to get lost,
as such.
I was hoping that you've almost narrowed it down to the filesystem
writeback code, with the last few mails?
