That, surely, is simply a bug? In which case, the patch someone posted
earlier to change the two capable() checks should solve it fine, even if
the author isn't a voter with a T-1...

We need the extra pair of capable() calls, yes. We should also have sanity
checking in the kernel: usermode shouldn't be given this sort of power
directly, it should go through a proper, sanity-checked API. Just look at
the flak MS took for not sanity-checking all the WIN32K.SYS functions...

Potentially dangerous hardware-dependent things should be done by/via the
driver for that hardware, NOT by handing userspace a nuke and pointing it
at the target!

Why not? All the uses you mention should be done through a proper kernel
API - NOT by userspace things on a "trust me, I'm being run by root"
basis.

So it has gone. That's my point.

The proposed patch was deleted from zeus shortly after upload, so I can't
look at it. I'm not interested in what that specific patch actually does -
it's the *design* that matters, and THAT is what is being discussed.

Yep - Linux would be fscking broken otherwise.

No, this sort of direct access is not legitimate. It should be done
through a proper sanity-checked API. The "give userspace a nuke and pray"
approach belongs in Redmond-born OSs, not Linux.

This is exactly the sort of hardware-dependent detail which the kernel
driver should handle, NOT leave up to userspace.

Oh, yes - very useful. I really want a piece of WWW page to be able to do
low-level things to my hardware. If you think that's a genuine feature, go
back to Redmond and resume patching QDOS derivatives.
