Because the controller's far more likely to go than the moving parts...
On the models I saw they also literally gold plated the connectors, spun the 
disks faster, and basically did everything they could think of to make the 
same basic bundle of components more expensive.  (Of course the fundamental 
thing you do to make it more expensive is have smaller production runs in the 
first place...)
