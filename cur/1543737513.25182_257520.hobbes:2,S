I ran memtest for a few hours. It all checks out. Also, CPU intensive 
stuff doesn't cause weirdness.
The only things which cause corruption, so far as I can tell, are 
operations on my raid device, md0. Copying from the array takes a while 
for a crash, while rebuilding a drive on the array is very prompt (<1m) at 
causing a crash. The crashes likely as not cause widespread kernel 
corruption. It's only a matter of time before my root fs is blown away 
again.
