I've been getting lost interrupts on both hda and hdb, I have also 
experienced a lost interrupt on eth0 using 2.3.41.  Each time this has 
resulted in needing to reboot the system.  I'm not sure whether the 
piix.c code is the problem as I wouldn't expect this to result in loss 
of interrupt on eth0(?).
Anyway I did as you suggested and replace 
../linux-2.3.41/drivers/block/piix.c for the same file from 2.3.40. To 
test whether this had solved the problem I set the system compiling a 
2.2.14 kernel and ran an updatedb to get lots of disk activity accross 
the primary bus.  I also ran X and a mail client.  The whole system then 
locked up.  No mouse or kb.  I was still able to ping the box, and 
telnet would connect but no login appeared.  I couldn't tell whether 
this was another part of the same problem... but its the only problem 
I've been experiencing with the 2.3.41 kernel.
The system is a dual-celeron using the abit bp6 otherboard.
