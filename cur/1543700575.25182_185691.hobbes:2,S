Subject: [ANNOUNCE] udev 010 release
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I've released the 010 version of udev.  It can be found at:
 	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-010.tar.gz
rpms built against Red Hat FC1 are available at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-010-1.i386.rpm
with the source rpm at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-010-1.src.rpm
udev is a implementation of devfs in userspace using sysfs and
/sbin/hotplug.  It requires a 2.6 kernel to run.  Please see the udev
FAQ for any questions about it:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev-FAQ
Please read the FAQ if you have any questions about devfs and udev.
It's been updated a lot in response to all of the confusion about this
topic.
The major changes since the 008 release are:
	- a number of bugs that were in the 009 release are now fixed.
	  The extras/ subdir should now build properly (but I take no
	  responsibility if it doesn't...)
	- we now don't blow away old config files if you install this
	  version on top of an older version.  Sorry about that...
	- udev now supports looking at multiple sysfs files at once for
	  a single rule.  This enables you to write such rules as:
	  LABEL, BUS="usb", SYSFS_vendor="FUJIFILM", SYSFS_model="M100", NAME="camera%n"
	  which helps in trying to identify a device in a unique way.
	  Right now udev supports up to 5 different sysfs files.  If you
	  want to have more, the code can be changed, just let me know.
	- new format modifier "%k" has been added to allow rules to use
	  the kernel name of the device.
	- an example shell script that handles an IDE devfs mapping has
	  been added to the tarball.  Thanks to Kay Sievers for this.
Thanks again to everyone who has send me patches for this release, a
full list of everyone, and their changes is below.
udev development is done in a BitKeeper repository located at:
	bk://linuxusb.bkbits.net/udev
Daily snapshots of this tree used to be found at:
	
http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/projects/bitkeeper/udev/
But that box seems to be down now.  Hopefully it will be restored
someday.  If anyone ever wants a tarball of the current bk tree, just
email me.
thanks,
greg k-h
