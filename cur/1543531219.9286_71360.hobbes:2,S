Nearly.  The recently added shmfs handles the memory management issues
and, being widely used, will get fairly thorough testing.

Most of what you ask has been carefully implemented for shmfs, except
for the filesystem part :-)
I.e., memory files were effectively added recently.  However, I think
for tmpfs you need to add read/write support (shmfs only does mmap I
think), some way to extend/truncate the files, and a directory
structure.

Only one way to find out :-)
