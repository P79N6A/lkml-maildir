Hello ppl,
I've recently switched to kernel 2.2.0, and I cannot poweroff my box by
using halt, halt -p or poweroff. It halts, but it doesn't poweroff. Same
thing happened with the version 2.1 of the kernel. Only with 2.0.36 works
as expected. It is rather straight forward that I have enabled APM support
and the option "Power off on shutdown" in either case.
Any ideas on what might be wrong?
Thnx in advance.
