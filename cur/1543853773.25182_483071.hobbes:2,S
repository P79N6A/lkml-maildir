Ahh, in that case you might be able to do this using the device mapper. 
  You could keep the filesystem mounted on the device mapper with a 
mapping to the underlying disk device.  Then change that mapping on the 
fly to mark a section of the device as mapped to a ramdisk and copy ( 
while that section is suspended ) the original data there.  Then resume 
the section, tamper with the underlying disk, then suspend the ramdisk 
mapping, copy it back to the underlying disk, then change the mapping 
back to normal.  You might also use a snapshot dm target instead of a 
ramdisk.
