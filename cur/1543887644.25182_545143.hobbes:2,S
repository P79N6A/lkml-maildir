Yes, I can almost confirm that this (open-coding of spin_lock_bh,
effectively) is the proper solution (Rusty's unreliable guide to
kernel-locking needs to be next to every developer's keyboard :-)
I also came across this idiom in other places in the networking code
so it seems to be pretty much the standard way. I wish I owned
bluetooth hardware, could've tested this for you myself.
Thanks,
Satyam
