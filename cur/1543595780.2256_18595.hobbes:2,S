This is consistent with what Alan said. "read" != "see".
I agree the messages can be ugly. But they don't do any harm either, and 
sometimes they're useful.
Furthermore, I believe that if you enforce a policy of removing them, the
direct result of that will be that GPL'd code is released back into the
community far slower than it is at the moment.
It's your choice, though.
