There were two major changes in the module code.  The first was to
simplify the userland interface, from:
	sys_create_module(name, size)
	sys_query_module(...) (a 5-way multiplexed syscall)
	sys_init_module(name, ptr)
to:
	sys_init_module(ptr, len, userargs)
To argue against this change is a demonstration of lack of
understanding, or a complete lack of taste.
The second change was the speed up one system of module locking in the
kernel which wasn't racy, and deprecate the other system which was
racy in 99% of its uses.  That is all.
Did it solve all the races in the kernel?  Of course not.  But it's
simple to use, already well understood in the kernel, and avoids
massive changes.  It also allows connection tracking to be properly
modularized, which was my long-lost original purpose.
I've repeated this enough now, I think.
Rusty.
