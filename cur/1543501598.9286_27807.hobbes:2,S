Chris Smith is quite right. Percentages may be used
to justify or hide losses in the board room and
yearly report, but good managers will try to 
minimize them. If somethings costs you $2M per year,
that means you will be willing to throw at least
$2M per year (and probably more) if doing so
will save $5M over a couple years. The extra
$5M gets your entire department a pay raise :-)
Reliability is important. However I think Linux
is well on the way. I've had single servers
run for *years*. I might add that several
upcoming projects for which I will be using 
Linux are going to be in the ultra-reliability
area. So I have a strong interest in anything
that makes the system even more high-rel and
fault tolerant.
