What do you mean by "overcommit" in this case - the total online user
quota exceeding total VM, or the Linux (memory allocated on demand)
sense?
And are you seriously telling me that if I take an Irix box, disable
user VM quotas and do a malloc() loop, the system crashes?! (Mental
note: Replace all Irix boxes with NT)

"The system fails"?? Either you have one broken system, or you have a
strange definition of "failure". The users should just get errors that
they don't have the resources available.

Crashing the system should not be possible under any circumstances,
regardless of resource quotas. If a user-mode program can crash the
system using only unprivileged syscalls, you have found a nasty bug.

Your quota settings would cause the system to begin denying resource
allocation BEFORE the system is saturated.

Yes there would - you run out of YOUR memory, even when the system has
plenty to spare.

Your approach, with a typical workload, would waste a large percentage
of the system's resources. Users rarely max out their quotas - but you
set the system to ensure that a user with a 128Mb quota has 128Mb
exclusively reserved for their use alone anyway?

Why? If I have the same level of resources as you, so the same
workload will succeed without any problems.
You still don't appear to understand what overcommit means in this
context.
