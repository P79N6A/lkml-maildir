Hi Dmitry,
I agree that these patches are ugly, but I wasn't able to think of any 
other way how to get rid of those lockdep warnings.
Of course the lock validator could be extended to provide API such as 
mutex_init_nolockdep(), as you already proposed before, but this also has 
it's drawbacks (for example if any other future user of ps2_init() uses 
the mutex in a really bad way, this would not be detected by lock 
validator).
Another possibility that comes to mind is extending the ps2dev structure 
with a field which would work as an subclass identifier for the device, 
and this field will be then be used as an subclass argument to 
mutex_lock_nested(). However, this requires proper setting of this field 
on the very same places on which my _nested functions are called, so it 
has the same level of generality.
Do you have any other idea? I think this should get fixed, otherwise we 
will keep receiving these reports from users again and again.
Thanks,
