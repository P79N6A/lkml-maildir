Yep, and that's not my concern.

That and the dread memory barrier thread that my head is still spinning
on.
Ok, lets take a close look at the code in question. I may be wrong, and if
so, great, we can fix it.
We have this in get_monotonic_cycles:
{
	cycle_t cycle_now, cycle_delta, cycle_monotonic, cycle_last;
	do {
		cycle_monotonic = clock->cycle_monotonic;
		cycle_last = clock->cycle_last;
		cycle_now = clocksource_read(clock);
		cycle_delta = (cycle_now - cycle_last) & clock->mask;
	} while (cycle_monotonic != clock->cycle_monotonic ||
		 cycle_last != clock->cycle_last);
	return cycle_monotonic + cycle_delta;
}
and this in clocksource.h
static inline void clocksource_accumulate(struct clocksource *cs, cycle_t now)
{
	cycle_t offset = (now - cs->cycle_last) & cs->mask;
	cs->cycle_last = now;
	cs->cycle_accumulated += offset;
	cs->cycle_monotonic += offset;
}
now is usually just a clocksource_read() passed in.
The goal is to have clock_monotonic always return something that is
greater than what was read the last time.
Let's make a few assumptions now (for others to shoot them down). One
thing is that we don't need to worry too much about MMIO, because we are
doing a read. This means we need the data right now to contiune. So the
read being a function call should keep gcc from moving stuff around, and
since we are doing an IO read, the order of events should be pretty much
synchronized. in
    1. load cycle_last and cycle_monotonic (we don't care which order)*
    2. read clock source
    3. calculate delta and while() compare (order doesn't matter)
* we might care (see below)
If the above is incorrect, then we need to fix get_monotonic_cycles.
in clocksource_accumulate, we have:
  offset = ((now = cs->read()) - cycle_last) & cs->mask;
  cycle_last = now;
  cycle_accumulate += offset;
  cycle_monotonic += offset;
The order of events here are. Using the same reasoning as above, the read
must be first and completed because for gcc it's a function, and for IO,
it needs to return data.
  1. cs->read
  2. update cycle_last, cycle_accumulate, cycle_monotonic.
Can we assume, if the above for get_monotonic_cycles is correct, that
since we read and compare cycle_last and cycle_monotonic, that neither of
them have changed over the read? So we have a snapshot of the
clocksource_accumulate.
So the worst thing that I can think of, is that cycle_monotonic is update
*before* cycle_last:
   cycle_monotonic += offest;
     <get_monotonic_cycles run on other CPU>
   cycle_last = now;
cycle_last = 5
cycle_monotonic = 0
    CPU 0                         CPU 1
  ----------                  -------------
 cs->read() = 10
 offset = 10 - 5 = 5
 cycle_monotonic = 5
                            cycle_monotonic = 5
                            cycle_last = 5
                            cs->read() = 11
                            delta = 11 - 5 = 6
                            cycle_monotonic and cycle_last still same
                            return 5 + 6 = 11
  cycle_last = 10
                            cycle_monotonic = 5
                            cycle_last = 10
                            cs->read() = 12
                            delta = 12 - 10 = 2
                            cycle_monotonic and cycle_last still same
                            return 5 + 2 = 7
                           **** ERROR *****
So, we *do* need memory barriers.  Looks like cycle_last and
cycle_monotonic need to be synchronized.
OK, will this do?
cycle_t notrace get_monotonic_cycles(void)
{
        cycle_t cycle_now, cycle_delta, cycle_monotonic, cycle_last;
        do {
                cycle_monotonic = clock->cycle_monotonic;
		smp_rmb();
                cycle_last = clock->cycle_last;
                cycle_now = clocksource_read(clock);
                cycle_delta = (cycle_now - cycle_last) & clock->mask;
        } while (cycle_monotonic != clock->cycle_monotonic ||
                 cycle_last != clock->cycle_last);
        return cycle_monotonic + cycle_delta;
}
and this in clocksource.h
static inline void clocksource_accumulate(struct clocksource *cs, cycle_t now)
{
        cycle_t offset = (now - cs->cycle_last) & cs->mask;
        cs->cycle_last = now;
	smp_wmb();
        cs->cycle_accumulated += offset;
        cs->cycle_monotonic += offset;
}
We may still get to a situation where cycle_monotonic is of the old value
and cycle_last is of the new value. That would give us a smaller delta
than we want.
Lets look at this, with a slightly different situation.
cycle_last = 5
cycle_monotonic = 0
    CPU 0                         CPU 1
  ----------                  -------------
 cs->read() = 10
 offset = 10 - 5 = 5
 cycle_last = 10
 cycle_monotonic = 5
                            cycle_monotonic = 5
                            cycle_last = 10
                            cs->read() = 12
                            delta = 12 - 10 = 2
                            cycle_monotonic and cycle_last still same
                            return 5 + 2 = 7
 cs->read() = 13
 offset = 13 - 10 = 2
 cycle_last = 13
                            cycle_monotonic = 5
                            cycle_last = 13
                            cs->read() = 14
                            delta = 14 - 13 = 1
                            cycle_monotonic and cycle_last still same
                            return 5 + 1 = 6
                        **** ERROR ****
Crap, looks like we do need a stronger locking here :-(
Hmm, I might as well just use seq_locks, and make sure that tracing
does not hit them.
Thanks!
