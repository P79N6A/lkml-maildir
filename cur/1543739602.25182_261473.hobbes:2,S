How so ? The idea is to add -m32 to whatever compiler you are using for
the rest of the kernel (assuming bi-arch) which is a lot more sane than
using whatever _local_ compiler you are using _and_ assuming bi-arch...
Of course, that would only be the "defaul", with the ability of explicitly
passing CROSS32_COMPILE to make...
