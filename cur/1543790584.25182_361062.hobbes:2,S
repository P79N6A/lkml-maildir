I installed the 64 bit version of my distro on a small partition,
the 32 bit version on a larger partition. Then I compiled a kernel
on the 64 bit system, and installed it on the 32 bit partition.
Now I boot a 64 bit kernel for the 32 bit userland, and mount the
64-bit distribution partition under /amd64 - if I need to do
anything in 64 bit userland (like compile a new kernel) I just
chroot /amd64
Even the 64-bit binary nvidia kernel driver works fine with
a 32-bit X in userland.
Mike.
