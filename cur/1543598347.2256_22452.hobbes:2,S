_maybe_ i can, but i think the value of the infinite
call trace can be argued, besides it will be quite hard
to realise... :)
i say maybe, because when this shit happens, alt+sysrq
combo doesnt seem to work, so it hardly can be that
scrolllock works. as i said console switching is dead
too, so i doubt other console-controlling keys will do.
