i believe that one of the points of capabilities is that once you've dropped
something, you can't take it back.  i.e. you can't gain a root bash shell
because you broke thru a hole.

certainly.  if you don't want astonished, don't jump through hoops to become
that user.  use an initial login.
if you set userlimits on username joe then switch users to jack, you are
still underneath the limits imposed on joe.  if joe isn't allowed to have X
resources, then he can't cheat by switching to jack's account.
in order to gain more resources, you must gain root privileges to extend
them.  by denying users the magic money-from-nothing, you're making the
system a little more secure.
