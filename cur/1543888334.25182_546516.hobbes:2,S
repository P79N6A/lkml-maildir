Subject: 2.6.21-mm2: ACPI exception on resume
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Starting with 2.6.21-mm2, I'm seeing occassional failures to resume
from suspend-to-ram on my Thinkpad R51. The screen will flash as it
usually does, then go black and the machine will become totally
unresponsive, even to holding down the power button for 30+ seconds.
But the hard drive light will occassionally flash, so the machine is
clearly not completely dead at this point.
The log contains this:
