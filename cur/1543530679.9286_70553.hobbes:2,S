I hadn't thought of it in this manner... something to think about.
I was referring to "I" as system administrator.

It might work better that the kernel inform a resource manager daemon
which could then send or not send the signals (or send them to a single
process group). This would allow for some policy handling where it
may be desirable to abort some processes and not abort the accounting
departments database.
