Andrea's right in that the semantics make it far too easy to introduce
bugs.  How about making bforget set a flag that the buffer head is to be
destroyed as soon as it's released?  If a filesystem re-uses the buffer,
mark_buffer_dirty can clear this destroyed flag (to handle the case where
a buffer head becomes legitimately reused).
