Here is a simple example...  Take busybox, disable everything but
insmod and lash (the simplest of the busybox shells).  Staticly
link vs uClibc -- the result is 61k (far less then the 440k from
glibc).  Now make a root fs that contains just /bin/sh (the
busybox binary), /sbin/insmod (a symlink to /bin/sh), and then
fill up / of your root fs with all the modules you wish to load.
Add in a simple script as /linuxrc or /sbin/init with something
like:
    #!/bin/sh
    /sbin/insmod /foo.o
Now, gzip the result.  With about 60k worth of modules, the final
initrd will compress to about 60k.  Simple, easy, small, and all
in userspace,
 -Erik
