You can always use md multipathing; an extension to the 2.4 multipathing has
been implemented by Jens Axboe and yours truely and is available at
http://lars.marowsky-bree.de/dl/md-mp;
 we'll see how Neil takes it when he
returns from vacation ;-)
We'll also be shipping that patch as part of United Linux.
IBM also did an extension to the LVM1 code to support multipathing; I don't
have an URL handy right now, but Google will certainly help out.
For 2.5, this is still not fully hashed out, but I assume you are running 2.4
on a production system ;-)
Sincerely,
