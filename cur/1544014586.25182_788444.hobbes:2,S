New syscall should have gone to linux-api, I think.
Do we really need another one for this?  How about using signalfd plus
setting the child's exit_signal to a queuing (SIGRTMIN+n) signal instead of
SIGCHLD?  It's slightly more magical for the userland process to know to do
that (fork -> clone SIGRTMIN).  But compared to adding a syscall we don't
really have to add, maybe better.
Thanks,
Roland
