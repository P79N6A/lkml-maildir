I also saw this sometime back and didn't understand it.
The solution was to run 'make mrproper' before building your kernel.
It is probably wise to take a copy of your ".config" file first
and then restore it (cause 'make mrproper' zaps it).
The reason for it is that the new sg driver (in 2.2.6) uses the
 SCSI_LOG_TIMEOUT macro provided by the SCSI mid-level. That
macro uses scsi_logging_level which is an EXPORT_SYMBOL in
scsi_syms.c when CONFIG_SCSI_LOGGING is active. It should
work ... [there is probably some tweak needed in the
Makefile in the SCSI directory].
Another approach is to deselect CONFIG_SCSI_LOGGING or compile
sg into the kernel (not as a module). But the 'make mrproper'
technique fixed the problem for me.
Did you download the whole 2.2.6 kernel or apply the patch to
2.2.5?
