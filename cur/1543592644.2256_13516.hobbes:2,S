Is there any way to delete the key of an existing loopback encrypted
device, and have it block, until a key is reloaded?
Of course any cached pages would need deleted, and dirty ones flushed
first.
To enable things like deleting keys from memory, before suspend-to-disk,
or forcing users of devices to verify identitiy, on various events.
