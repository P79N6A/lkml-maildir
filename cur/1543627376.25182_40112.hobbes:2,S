Hello,
trying to load a uhci module from 2.4.19-pre6 at boot locks my computer.
In 2.4.18 I noticed that the USB printing stopped to work
(see the thread "USB printing via ptal broke between 2.4.17 and .18"
started on 29 Mar). I the tested 2.4.19-pre5 and loading the uhci
module locked the machine. In -pre6 the behaviour is the same.
Can I switch some debug mode on to help you seeing where the thing
locks?
This is on the Abit BP6 motherboard (Celeron SMP box). I see that
there are quite a few changes in the uhci area - please, don't
make final 2.4.19 until these issues are resolved.
Using usb-uhci is not an option for me, as it is causing lockups
when printing to a USB printer (and ever did so). uhci was OK
in this regard up to 2.4.17.
Regards
