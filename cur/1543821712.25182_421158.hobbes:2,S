Most, if not all PCI-based framebuffer drivers call pci_disable_device()
in their unload routine. Although it's very rare that framebuffer drivers
are unloaded, if you do, and the the resources are also disabled, it will
kill the VGA core of the card.  You lose your text console and even
hang the machine.

Alan Cox, if I remember correctly, advises against calling pci_disable_device()
for video drivers when they unload.
