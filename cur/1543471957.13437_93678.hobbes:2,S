Nice, but *how* ?
Does it just use `map 8 implies prefetch 16-31' ?
If so, what if the application does 1 3 5 7 9 ?
Or what if the application does `1 567 34 90 9486 8' ?
Should the last 8 trigger prefetch of 16-31 ?
Using `read' is like giving an implicit `madvise(SEQUENTIAL)' since it's rarely
used for random (or even stride) access.  `mmap' has to be more careful.
