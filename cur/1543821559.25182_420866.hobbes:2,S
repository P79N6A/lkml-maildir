Thanks, so it's a question of simplicity/completeness :)

Lubos Lunak also reminds me of SUSE's preload
(
http://en.opensuse.org/index.php?title=SUPER_preloading_internals
)
which is a user-land solution using strace to collect the info.
And there's Andrea Arcangeli's "bootcache userspace logging" kernel
patch(
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/8/6/216
).
