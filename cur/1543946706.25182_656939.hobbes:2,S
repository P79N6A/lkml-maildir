It will be interesting to see the stack dump.  As far as I can tell,
there are two pathways which could lead qh being NULL.  One is the IAA
hardware peculiarity (setting the status bit very late, after the
watchdog timer has already expired), and the other is in unlink_async()  
if the controller isn't running.  That second one may be just a simple
bug -- I doubt it would show up unless the controller got a fatal 
error and stopped.
