No, You misunderstood the problem:
sti
** NMI handler
** normal interrupt arrives, is queued by the cpu
** irqd from NMI handler
** cpu notices the normal interrupt, handles it.
** normal interrupt does a wakeup, schedules a tasklet, whatever
** irqd from normal interupt
hlt << cpu sleeps.
Thus: lost wakeup.
