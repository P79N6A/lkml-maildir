Hello, guys.
New version of mtkdiff package is available.  Changes since last release 
(20050514) are.
* patchkdiff added.  Idea is from patchview of Randy Dunlap (Hi!).
   patchkdiff can show multiple diff files.
* quiltkdiff rewritten in perl.  It's faster and doesn't push/pop quilt
   repository.  Patches are rolled back and applied in a temporary
   working directory.
* gitkdiff rewritten in perl.  It now works with the new git diff
   output format and a bit faster.  Also, this version can show
   multiple commits.  For example, you can do the following.
   $ git-rev-list HEAD ^OLD_HEAD | gitkdiff -c -r
* modified gitk-1.2.
