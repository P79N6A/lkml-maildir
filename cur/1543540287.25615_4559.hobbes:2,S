cd is a built-in shell command. The syscall used to change directory is
chdir (fchdir). You can find sys_chdir in fs/open.c.
This bit sets the cwd (pwd) to the 'dentry' corresponding to the filename
given as argument to sys_chdir.
        /* exchange dentries */
        tmp = current->fs->pwd;
        current->fs->pwd = dentry;
        dentry = tmp;
current is a 'struct task_struct' and you can find it in
include/linux/sched.h

What is a dentry? you ask. Try
