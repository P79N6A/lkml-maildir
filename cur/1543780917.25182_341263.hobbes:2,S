Sorry, but I can't provide them, because I changed the VIA chipset based 
mainboard against a NForce4 Ultra chipset mainboard.
But on heise.de they also pointed out that it's VIA's bug. Not the 
harddrives one, they have some but this not apply on VIA. Samsung act 
and updated the firmware of their drives for compatibility reasons.
And the work-around is to jumper the hdd as SATA I hdd. The problem was, 
that my system to this time was not bootable with my Samsungs Hd160JJ 
and VIA VT8237. Nos they fix it with a new Chipset the VT8327R...where 
we don't need a work-around.
