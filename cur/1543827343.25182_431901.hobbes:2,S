No, plain vanilla kernel support this feature. There are lots of
users using the single-user, multi-head feature of fbcon. I've been using it.
The developer of one of the cyber cards also use it.
The main goal of the linuxconsole people is true multiuser, multihead.
One user per card simultaneously.

Yes, fbcon does intermediate between drivers, so it's not a problem.

Yes, by not providing the user with the option to load and bind
multiple drivers at one time, we are essentially not supporting this
feature.  And that's not a problem. /sys/class/vtconsole/vtcon[x]/bind
handles wholesale binding and unbinding, ie, when you echo 1 > bind,
only that driver, and nothing else, becomes active.
My point is: 'Multiple active drivers feature' is a natural consequence
of the evolution of the code, but the only way to take advantage of it
is if we provide a means for the user to use it.  And we are not
providing the means.

No, matroxfb and any other fbdev drivers has no knowledge whatsoever about
the console.
