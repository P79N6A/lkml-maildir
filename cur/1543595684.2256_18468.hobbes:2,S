Ignoring "junk hardware" is not practical it will bite you everyday all
day long.........Best example is VIA.

If one is going to learn the rules it is best to have learned from on of
the "Fathers of ATA", and given that I have been crowned "Hale Jr." I take
this a compliment.  The reality is that I am not anywhere in the same
class of understanding as Hale Landis, but getting there.

If they all did the same thing (regardless of class) it would be a
different issue.  Basic things like asking for N amounts of data and
getting back N+M > N the buffer allocated.  Or worse is the under
data-run.  Other issues are DRQ, failure to hold/set busy-bit.
The ATAPI people do not even follow the rules in the defunct guide.

That point is only important during POST and execution of drive
diagnostics command and Linux does not call that command.

See above, regardless of the brokeness whe have to mucky with it.
So I move to develop to a standard that I have influence and direction
control, then deal with the exceptions.
ATA-X created the "packet-command" and "data-phase-handlers" based on the
zero-bit in the error_feature task-register.
Lastly it does not exist anymore, a real problem for manufacturers
building product on a document that does not exist.  Worse is that there
are companies making hardware based on SFF-8020 v2.5!

Abstract:  INF-8020i defines defines a Packet Interface for use with CD-ROM 
drives that use the ATA (AT Attachment) interface.
The members voted in September 1999 that this specification Expire. 
SFF-8020 has been incorporated into two national standards, SCSI MMC (Multi 
Media Commands) and ATA/ATAPI (AT Attachment).
