How about using a little nice PGP or S/MIME signature :-)
I was sure that sooner or later it was going to happen.
I know that some people does not like it because it adds some
lines to e-mail messages (I myself have received hate e-mails
sometimes...) but the overhead is negligible and the efect is that
everybody knows that it is going to be much (orders of magnitude) 
difficult to impersonate you.begin:vcard
