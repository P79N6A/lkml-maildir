i've read the discussions, and i cannot see it analyzed anywhere _what_ 
causes the wakeups. And how are these wakeups counted? Is this based on 
powertop output:
 Wakeups-from-idle per second : 20.4     interval: 1.8s
? Somewhere i saw it mentioned that "the CPU throws out of C mode". What 
does that mean - does it mean we try to idle again and again, but we 
immediately return from C mode - while this all looks like "idle" time 
to the scheduler (so 'top' will show lots of idle time), but the ACPI 
wakeup counters are going up like mad? What is /proc/interrupts doing 
when this happens - is any of the irq sources going upwards?
