The intention of the DRM work is to reuse fbcon without change if
possible or minimize the changes needed.

No code has been written for this, but part of the plan is to split
the console function into two pieces: boot and user. The boot console
would be non-accelerated and use fbcon for drawing. It's goal is to be
as reliable as possible and to work in all environments including
interrupt time. Booting in single user mode would use boot console. So
would OOPs and initial boot.
Another major console use is for normal users doing things like
editing and command line stuff. This console would be implemented in
user space. User space console can call into DRM and achieve full
acceleration. This would also allow consoles in Asian and Indic
languages.

The plan for mode setting is to move as much as possible of it to user
space via a hotplug event. The driver would then be informed of the
information it needs like framebuffer location, dimensions, mode
register values, etc.
