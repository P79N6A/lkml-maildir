Thanks Mandeep for this patch.
By reading Ingo's review, I notice that the checks done by
check_hung_task() are quite lightweight and then quick.
I guess your loop is able to go through a good number of tasks before
actually needing to be resched.
Perhaps the max_count can be dropped actually, since it is a kind of
arbitrary chosen constant.
So you would just need to check need_resched() at each iteration.
ie (should be split in helper functions):
bool retry = false;
do {
	read_lock(&tasklist_lock);
	do_each_thread(g, t) {
		/* use "==" to skip the TASK_KILLABLE tasks waiting on NFS */
		if (t->state == TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE)
			check_hung_task(t, now, timeout);
                if (need_resched()) {
                    get_task_struct(t);
                    read_unlock(&tasklist_lock);
                    schedule();
                    read_lock(&tasklist_lock);
                    put_task_struct(t);
                    if (t->state == TASK_DEAD) {
                        retry = true;
                        goto unlock;
                    }
                }
	} while_each_thread(g, t);
 unlock:
	read_unlock(&tasklist_lock);
} while(retry);
There are good chances that your "t" task hasn't died, but if so, you
can just retry the whole thing.
Perhaps that should require some tests to see if there is a good
average of t->stat == TASK_DEAD path not taken,
but of course, it depends on what the system is doing most.
What do you think?
