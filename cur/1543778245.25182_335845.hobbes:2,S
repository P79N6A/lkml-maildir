i've been experimentally adding -funswitch-loops and -fpeel loops to the
default -march=i586 in the ../arch/i386/Makefile
cflags-$(CONFIG_M586)       += -march=i586 -funswitch-loops -fpeel-loops
based on some tests with gcc 3.4.3,4 and the cyrix mii cpu, but
with v2.6.13-rc3-git5 carelessly put these flags on the next,
cflags-$(CONFIG_M586TSC) line, and so they would not have been used.
i shall retest after recompiling to confirm.

yeah, a couple nbench runs show similar overall results as -git4
