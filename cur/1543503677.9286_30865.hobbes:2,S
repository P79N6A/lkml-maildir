probably, but I remember having done this a long time ago : I shared 2 scsi
disks (80 MB each) between DOS and Linux on 2 separated hosts, and it worked
quite well. I believe my scsi cards were aha1520 and aha1542, but I'm not
really sure now since it was about 2 years ago.
but I must admit this was only for test purposes, and under low load, so
perhaps the bus reset never came during an I/O operation.
