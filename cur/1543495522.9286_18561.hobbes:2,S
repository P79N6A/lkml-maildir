Since I only have i386 so it's hard for me to try out the code (I could
try if it compile using a cross compiler of course...)
I looked at Alpha now and there is a good news and a bad news...
The good news is that you don't need to implement a disable_irq_nosync()
because it just exists and right now is called disable_irq() (the bad news
is implicit in the good news ;).
(offtopic: I noticed that an Alpha architecture is called "avanti" that in
plain Italian means "go ahead", who knows if it's called so due it's
italian meaning... ;).
Interesting to not that even if disable_irq() in alpha can return before
all irq are expired in all CPU, then if an enable_irq() is run while there
is the irq still running, the Alpha port won't allow the irq to reenter
itself as in the i386 case (but the i386 race was really subtle and the
i386 port was at least trying to wait all irq to expire).
Since it's fun to write code for hardware I don't own I'll try to fix the
race in Alpha too but in remote-mode ;).
Here is an alpha-Alpha patch ;) for 2.2.8 that address the disable_irq()
SMP race. Seems quite strightforward to me.
(it's called alpha-irq-nosync-2.2.8-A)

Tell me if it compiles. If it compiles then make sure to use disable_irq()
in the network driver to try out my new code (using disable_irq_nosync()
as 2.2.8 does, wouldn't stress my patch above).
As implementation details: I added a irq_desc because the right thing to
do is to put data accessed by the same CPU near (and in this case I also
added a pad to cacheline align also considering the max nr of irq is 64,
not too much). Otherwise I imagine we would generate a heavy ping pong of
data between L1 caches in SMP.
