That's an acceptable answer, I suppose, given that glibc ships its own
copy of the file in question.
But it does contain ioctl definitions, and if we ever added any new
ioctls presumably they'd be added there too? It does seem to be the kind
of thing we _do_ want to export from the kernel, surely?

All the more reason for us to export it for ourselves and exert some
editorial control, perhaps?
