If the sysfs file blocked, this could be handled quite cleanly, and
would reflect accurate PCI config state.

Let's say the device is in D3cold (i.e. the parent bridge has been
powered down).  In that case, you might want to get an error (probably
-EIO, but maybe FF...).  A buffered copy would be incorrect if used by a
userspace driver, as this would be hiding a legitimate failure
condition.

I suppose we have very different ideas about the actual role and purpose
of this sysfs interface.  As I see it, it provides direct access to
hardware for userspace device drivers (software that actually cares
about the ugly PCI details).  It's much lower-level than the highly
abstracted "vendor", "device", "resourceX", etc. interfaces.  As such,
it's very important that it accurately reflects what's actually going on
in hardware, even if this is of potentially greater hassle to userspace.
Now that's not to suggest that we shouldn't block this interface when
making a power state transition.  But I think it's best to expose the
hardware failure and powered off cases as errors.
On the other hand you seem to suggest that it is a potentially
approximate cache of the pci config space that primarily serves to
provide pci configuration data to userspace hardware detection
mechanisms.  However, in this case, I think it may as well be marked as
deprecated, as it's clearly inferior to the higher order sysfs
attributes ("vendor", "device", "irq", "class", etc.) with regard to
accuracy, code complexity (both for the kernel and userspace), and
ease-of-use.  In other words, I don't see a reason any userspace app
should ever use it other than for debugging (i.e. lspci).
