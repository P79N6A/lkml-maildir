__GFP_USERRCLM is the original name and the motivation for changing it to
__GFP_USER no longer exists. However, __GFP_EASYRCLM would also make sense
as it flags pages that are (surprise surprise) easily reclaimed. Would
__GFP_EASYRCLM be the best choice? __GFP_USERRCLM may imply to some
readers that it is reclaimed by the user somehow. The flags would then be;
__GFP_EASYRCLM - Allocations for pages that are easily reclaimed such as
userspace and buffer pages
__GFP_KERNRCLM - Allocations for pages that may be reclaimed by the kernel
such as caches
No flag - Page cannot be easily reclaimed by any mechanism.
I would be happy with __GFP_USERRCLM but __GFP_EASYRCLM may be more
obvious?
