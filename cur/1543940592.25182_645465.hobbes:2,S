Hi all,
Now I am porting a device driver to Linux, its source code is not opened.
In this module, I use some interface functions exported from GPL
module through EXPORT_SYMBOL macros. (not EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL), For
example, register_sound_dsp() and so on.
Do I violate GPL? How to solve it?
Thanks a lot, any suggestion is appreciated.
Cooper
