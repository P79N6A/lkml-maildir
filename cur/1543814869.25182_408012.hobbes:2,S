Given that the name starts with "un", I would *expect*
unshare(CLONE_FOO) to mean that I no longer want to share FOO.
If you want the argument to have the same sense as in the clone system
call, you will have to call it "share" rather than "unshare" (and then
explain to confused developers why they can't use it to start sharing
things that previously weren't shared :).
