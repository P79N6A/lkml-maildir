Please replace #include <asm/types.h> with #include <linux/types.h>
otherwise you will get following 'make headers_check' warnings:
  usr/include/asm/swab.h:4: include of <linux/types.h> is preferred
over <asm/types.h>
  usr/include/asm/swab.h:14: found __[us]{8,16,32,64} type without
#include <linux/types.h>

ditto.
If possible, please also fix your other patches which are in queue.
