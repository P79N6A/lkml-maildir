I'd have to take a close look.  The syscall interface is modelled on
getrusage(), and only lets you get your own or your children's data;
I'm not too worried about trashing it, as it should be possible to
emulate in terms of netlink (albeit at a cost; system calls are
relatively cheap)
/proc/<pid>/task/<tid>/msa lets you get at anything you own.  I use
awk scripts to process the msa file in /proc/... and pipe it into
gnuplot at n second intervals; a netlink interface would need to have
an auxiliary program to read it and then squirt it into the scripts, I
think --- or is there a way to get ASCII out on demand?  I quite often
use cat to do quick checks on whats going on too --- so overall I think
the /proc interface is desirable.
