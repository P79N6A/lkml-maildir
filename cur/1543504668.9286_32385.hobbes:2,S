  hi,
  how do I implement a encryption algorithm for a password in C?
  I'm writing this code in Linux. I have tried to use the crypt()

Hi yawlee,
The undefined reference is libcrypt :). You need to compile your
programme with -lcrypt, or else the compiler will never find the
crypt() function code in libcrypt.
Also, an important point: Your question is a general C programming
question. This list is intended for Linux *kernel* programming. You
really should send your questions to a general programming newsgroup
like comp.lan.c rather than here.
regards,
