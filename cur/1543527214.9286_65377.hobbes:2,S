No.  I'm advocating /proc (procfs in general as it can be mounted anywhere)
contain only the data for which it was designed: PROCESSES - period.
There shouldn't be one damned bit of english text in there anywhere.
The entire procfs was designed for accessing process table information
without looking directly through kernel memory.  The pre-procfs method
was to lookup a kernel symbol (or be compiled with it) for the location
of the process table, open /dev/kmem (normally you'd need to be root to
do this), and then walk the task structure.
This is simply a "damned mess" -- as was explained to me a decade ago.
This method intoduces all kinds of problems ranging from parsing something
that isn't the process tree to getting half wrong results as the kernel
alters the table on you.  At least under SunOS, 'ps' needed access to
the kernel you were running -- you've got access to /dev/kmem, might
as well have access to /vmunix too, eh.
There's too much stuff in /proc.  Much of it required for programs you
would never expect would want to see what is historically process data.

Please do not try to preach you apathy to me.  The whole "it's inefficient
anyway so why should _I_ try to be any better" arguement is a crock of shit.
To that I say, "Go back to writing JAVA and stay the hell out of the kernel.
Dammit, this is the _kernel_; it should even flush toilets with efficiency."
(Apathy breeds apathy; if you don't give a damn, nobody else will.)

Umm, how in god name is sprintf(), copy (3 times), sscanf()/atoi() a better
way to read a number?  If the only thing you know how to program is awk,
then maybe, but the real programmers use C. (I will accept C++ as an answer
but you only get half credit.)

What?  "system monitoring tools"?  You're perl scripts can do practically
everything a C program can do including processing binary data structures
and making system calls (ioctls, etc.) -- don't tell me otherwise because
I've done it many times before.

The data should be structured efficiently for those things that will be
accessing it.  Human readable text is the worst possible input to any
computer program.  Structuring data such that a human can read it directly
for the .001% of the time that a human will be reading it is both inefficient
and stupid.
I think I've insulted enough kernel programmers for today :-)
My main problems with procfs:
 1 - Most of it is designed for humans to read, however, humans never read it.
     Programs are forced to parse english text to do anything. (kernel
     sprintf()'s, program then sscanf()'s, processes, and printf()'s again.)
 2 - /proc is the only point of reference to most of what's in it.  Disable
     procfs and practically nothing works.
 3 - dependance on procfs (see #2) makes secured binary environments (i.e.
     chroot()ed areas) difficult and impossible.
 4 - the read() code path is a freakin' nightmare -- drive your kernel nuts;
     read stuff in /proc one char at a time :-)
