  Wow, Advanced Sarcasm.  Must be part of the Graduate program...
  Meanwhile on Win2k I can intercept any IO request by
wrting a filter driver, and that driver can get control on the way
back to userspace by registering a completion routine.  Such filters
can be arbitrarily chained together and can be placed either above or
below an FSD, making such things as virus detection, HSM and disk
mirroring much easier to write...
  How would I do this on Linux?  How would virus detection and HSM
coexist?  (HSM would have to be 'above' the virus detector, since it
makes no sense to try and scan a file that's been migrated until it
gets recalled back to disk.)
