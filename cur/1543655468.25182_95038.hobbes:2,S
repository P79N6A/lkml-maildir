    Has anyone begun work on a driver for modifying Synaptics Touchpad
settings for kernel 2.5 (bugzilla bug #18)?  The userspace tools to do
this won't (and can't) work with the new input system -- this was
discussed here in October:
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0210.0/0681.html
    This is the only thing keeping me from migrating to 2.5 full-time
on the computer I use most often -- if I can't turn off the
"tap-to-click" crap I'll end up e-mailing porn to my Grandma or
something else uncouth. :-0
