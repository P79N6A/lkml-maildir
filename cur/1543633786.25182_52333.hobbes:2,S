Well, intentional behaviour is hardly what I would call a stall.  I 
thought you were implying that it would stall the queue indefinitely.  I'm 
fully aware that it forces the queue to wait until all outstanding 
commands have completed before sending the untagged command, that's part 
of the desired behaviour in that case.

This I'm not following.  If you get a QUEUE_FULL from the adaptec driver, 
then the commands you are pushing back should still be tagged and no stall 
should be required beyond just waiting for any outstanding command on the 
drive to complete or for a timeout to pass.  It should not require any 
untagged type stall where you have to drain the entire pipeline...

I would think that, eventually, the bio layer will support I/O fencing via 
tagged commands (aka, ext3 needs an I/O fence and the bio layer does as 
needed to enforce that, which on scsi may mean an ordered queue tag is 
generated instead of a regular tag and on IDE it may mean something else).  
It will have to be able to tell that some of these conditions have been 
satisfied in those cases, so I see no reason why it shouldn't be made 
aware of them now.  Just my $.02
