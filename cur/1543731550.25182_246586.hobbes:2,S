Nevertheless, I think I'd prefer that we not move code which has
side-effects into BUG_ONs.  For some reason it seems neater that way.
Plus one would like to be able to do
	BUG_ON(strlen(str) > 22);
and have strlen() not be evaluated if BUG_ON is disabled.
A minor distinction, but one which it would be nice to preserve.
