The values which you chose here would imply that these values can be ORed
together.  But they can't can they?
If not, plain old 0,1,2,3 would be clearer.
We often use enums for this sort of thing.

The above makes it look like this is a kerneldoc comment, but it isn't.

These I assume _can_ legitimately be ORed together.
These also could be a enum.

hm.  It might be nicer to make these static inline functions.  Especially
if the code is consistent about what C type is used to represent voltage
and current.

We conventionally put the kerneldoc at the definition site, not at the

Is the sysfs interface documented in here somewhere so we can review it?

I think you'll find that all these can be implemented more nicely as static
inlines.
