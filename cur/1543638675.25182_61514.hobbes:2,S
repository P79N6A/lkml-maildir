Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch has been verified to apply cleanly to 2.5.30
This patch fixes a build warning in smp.h.  register_cpu_notifier uses
struct notifier_block in its argument list.  Unfortunately, there are
places where smp.h is included before the definition of this structure.
