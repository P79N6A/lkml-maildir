The point was if gcc did use the fact that variables are adyacent in memory
to generate better code, and this degenerated into the current discussion
about where they are from the programmers perspective.
- If gcc is going to use the fact that some variables are nearby for some
  optimization purposes, I do trust the gcc hackers to set stuff up so that
  they use it for variables that are nearby in VM, not just where defined
  together. If variables defined together end up adyacent or not is
  completely irrelevant. The compiler might even rearrange them to
  optimize for the access pattern observed.
- As a C programmer, you are only entitled to assume that pieces of the
  same object (array or struct) are laid out in memory in the order
  given. With segmented VM different objects would probably end up in
  different segments anyway.
