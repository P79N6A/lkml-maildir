No.  The point in 2.3.x was to encourage them not to used ancient a.out formats.
In particular the OMAGIC a.out format, (which all new a.out compiles should produce)
is perfectly fine.
The messages were also put in at the beginning of 2.3 to give people plenty of
warning of the changes.  2.2 was really never supposed to see that code.
Since you asked the point of the messages :)
