Maybe I didn't read carefully:  "to add arch selection to kconfig"..
arch/cris using drivers/Kconfig: patch is below (maintainer is
cc-ed)

Move arch/cris to using drivers/Kconfig for its drivers config list.
When all arches do this, Sam can make more interesting improvements
to .config files.
Using drivers/Kconfig adds these kconfig files to cris:
connector, misc, ata, message/fusion (not avail.), macintosh (not avail.),
i2c, spi, w1, power, hwmon, mfd, video, hid, mmc, leds,
infiniband (not avail.), edac (not avail.), rtc, dma, auxdisplay,
kvm (not avail.), uio, and lguest (not avail.).
Many of these are already enabled/disabled per arch., so adding that
for cris can be done as required.
"not avail." means that this menu is not valid for this arch.
and won't be presented to users when running 'make *config'.
