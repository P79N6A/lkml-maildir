I've spent ages trying to fix these bugs in the -ac kernel,
but they got all backed out in search of better performance.
Right now I'm developing a VM again, but I have no interest
at all in fixing the livelocks in the main kernel, they'll
just get removed again after a while.
If you want to test my VM stuff, you can get patches from
http://surriel.com/patches/
 or direct access at the bitkeeper
tree on 
http://linuxvm.bkbits.net/
cheers,
Rik
