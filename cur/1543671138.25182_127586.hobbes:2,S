Thanks. Yes, this indeed seems to map to some functionality that's
understood by the kernel.
Strange. So does this mean that non-ALSA mixers should not work when
using ALSA ? Why do they seem to anyway ? Is the driver or hardware
side of this mute flag just rarely implemented ? Or is the kernel
default not always "mute" ?
