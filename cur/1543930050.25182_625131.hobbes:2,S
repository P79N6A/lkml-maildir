We've often had bugs like this. Sure it could be fixed here, but then
the next bug would crop up again later I bet.
It would be better to move the first user  space code execution later I think. 
I guess the hotplug events could be delayed or initrd just mounted later.
Running any user space before __initcall() has finished is just wrong.
