LMbench has had something which does this for years.  Look at 
	
http://www.bitmover.com/bw.gif
	
http://www.bitmover.com/seek.gif
The first shows you zone bandwidths, the second shows you a precise profile
of the access times; you can get everything you might want from that.
For example, the time quoted by all the drive people is 1/3 in from the 
left, at the bottom of the curve - a fairly misleading number if you ask
me.
The benchmark is in disk.c.

Bingo.  Screwing around with the elevator is in general a waste of time,
but it is a rite of passage for all I/O people.  I did it a long time 
ago and learned an important lesson: if your file system is good enough 
(and most are) there is almost nothing that can be done to improve 
performance - the file system has done all the work already.  You're
welcome to argue that point, but please do so with traces of a real
system - not with your opinion.  My opinion used to be the opposite
and the traces moved me to this opinion.
