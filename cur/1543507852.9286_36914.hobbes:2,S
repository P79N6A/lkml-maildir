If Bjorn Ekwall wants to continue to maintain modutils then I will drop
my 2.3 tree.  If Bjorn wants to hand it over to me, I will merge his
final 2.2 changes into my 2.3 tree.  If somebody else wants to maintain
modutils they can decide which versions they will use.  No way am I
going to fork this code.
