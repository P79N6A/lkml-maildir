But what default? Gentoo just calls evms_activate before mounting 
filesystems to check if there are evms volumes (because filesystems can 
reside on it). And, according to man page, this is the right usage of 
evms_activate. And Gentoo could not know easily that I have no evms 
volumes in the system. And I possibly could insert some and boot Gentoo 
(and for example have label not device in fstab to specify fs to mount). I 
really think that evms_activate should not take the device that is not for 
it. And I think Gentoo is right. (And it is the best distro I ever tried.)
