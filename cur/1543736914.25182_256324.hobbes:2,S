But this would require two additional int field in task_t just for that
rarely used functionality.

The custom on lkml, for Linus and Andrew is to send them inline. I also
prefer them inline. Will try to remember sending attachments when sending a
patch to you.

That is an interesting issue. If that would work correctly one could
trigger an signal if more than a certain amount of cputime is used.
It looks though that it will create an interrupt based on real time.
SuS says:
 Each implementation defines a set of clocks that can be used as timing
 bases for per-process timers. All implementations support a clock_id of
 CLOCK_REALTIME.
So restrict timer_create to CLOCK_REALTIME and CLOCK_MONOTONIC? Is it
necessary to be able to derive a timer from a timer derives from those
two?
something like the following (just inlined for the discussion ...)?
