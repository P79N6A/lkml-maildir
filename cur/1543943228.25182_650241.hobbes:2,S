You said it! Gotcha! :-)
There's no difference if what I'm going to modify is the binary or the 
source: it's a criminal act anyway.
So why not release the source? :-)

I was simply implying there are easier ways than others... And binary 
drivers can't help...

Well, the driver must trust the user, that's my point.
If the user lies, the driver can't know (well, it could, but I don't 
think it could be considered "reasonable"...).

Allowing the lying user to download a driver for another country...

And it's a reason to release open drivers, so that everybody can check 
there's no such bug. And, if found, it can be fixed with a lot less effort.
BTW I've now asked a lawyer... Waiting his answer.
BYtE,
