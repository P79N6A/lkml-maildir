We're not going to expose the network protocol.  For two reasons: 
    - it works really well (we're proud of this)
    - it is really ugly (we're not proud of this :)
A read only client isn't read only, it has to be read/write to update the
out of date copy.
Believe me, if there was an easy way to give away a version that was not
a problem we would have long since done that.
