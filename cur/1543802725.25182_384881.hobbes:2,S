So far so  good.
I am very happy to inform you about my success in getting those funds 
transferred  under the cooperation of a new partner from HongKong. Presently 
I'm in India for investment projects with my own share of the total sum.
Meanwhile,I didn't forget your past efforts and attempts to assist me in 
transferring those funds despite that it failed us some how.
In appreciation of your assistance I have mapped out as a compensation and 
wrote on your favour a check worth of Us$500,000.55.
So, you can now contact my secretary in Benin republic,  Mr John Akpali on 
his e-mail  address ( akpalijohn@inbox.com ) and phone number + 22997601483 
ask him to send you  the total of $500.000.00 which I kept for your 
compensation for all the past  efforts and attempts to assist me in this 
matter.
Bear in mind that this $500,000 is in draft, not cash, so you need to send 
to him your full names and address as where this draft/check will be 
posted/delivered.
I appreciated your efforts at that time very much.So feel free and get in 
touched with my secretary John Akpali and instruct  him where to send the  
amount to you. Please do let me know immediately you  receive it so that we 
can share the joy after all the sufferness at that time.
In the moment,I'm very busy here because of the investment projects which me 
and the new partner are having at hand, finally, remember that I had 
forwarded instruction to the secretary on your behalf to receive that money, 
so
feel  free to get in touch with John aKPALI, he will send the amount to you 
without any delay.
Regards,
Adams Kofi
