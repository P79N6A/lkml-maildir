I have reviewed the above patches and tested them with what I believe to be most combinations. 
Everything worked and corrected the unintended consequence of breaking bcm43xx when b44 is included. 
I agree that these patches belong in 2.6.25 and stable (2.6.24). Of course, the problem goes away in 
2.6.26.
