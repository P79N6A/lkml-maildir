Greetings,
As $subject says, up-to-date SuSE 10.0 /sbin/ifup became confused...
-[pid  8191] lstat64("/sys/class/net/eth1", {st_mode=S_IFLNK|0777, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
-[pid  8191] lstat64("/sys/block/eth1", 0xafec0f9c) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
...and wandered off into lala-land.
It used to do...
+[pid  8905] lstat64("/sys/class/net/eth1", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
+[pid  8905] readlink("/sys/class/net/eth1/device", "../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:02:09.0", 255) = 53
+[pid  8905] readlink("/sys/class/net/eth1/device", "../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:02:09.0", 255) = 53
...and made working network interface.
