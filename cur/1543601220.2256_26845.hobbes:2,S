Well, fsck wants to ask 
	"Found an unattached inode, connect to lost+found?"
to the user and will interrupt an automatic reboot for that.
This is bad: The safe choice is safe: It won't cause data-loss. 
Maybe it should report it (say by Email), but interrupting a reboot
just for connecting a couple of files to lost+found, that's
rediculous.
If it would give me enough information when I do this manually, I'd
make an informed decision. However, what are the chances of me knowing
that inode 123456 is a staroffice bak-file? So the only way to safely
operate is to link them into lost+found, and then to look at the files
manually.
