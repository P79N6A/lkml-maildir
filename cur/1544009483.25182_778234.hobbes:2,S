note that since the IRQ marker always comes on an entry record, there's 
space in the usecs field for something like:
  1)   2.722 us    |                                    }
  1)               |                                    __wake_up_bit() {
  1)  [IRQ#123]   ==>                                   __wake_up_bit() {
right?
