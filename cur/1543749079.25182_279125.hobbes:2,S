I do the same kind of thing in ppc32 and want to get rid of it too.

Legacy IO ports, there should be one space per PCI domain. There is also
legacy ISA memory space though on some ppc's, this doesn't exist at all.
I suspect we want to expose both in a way.

We should imho. On ppc, we have a 64k space per domain. One of the main
set of HW that has use for these are VGA cards. It's perfectly possible
to have a Mac with an AGP card in the AGP port and a PCI video card in
one of hte PCI slots, and those are on 2 different domains with
different legacy (0...64k) IO spaces.
We defininitely want whatever interface we define to deal with that.

That and legacy memory space, which we may want to mmap as well in a
more portable way than there is now (for platforms where it is
available).

I think so, it's an ISA thing, but some video and token ring cards, for
example, still rely on it. Not all host bridges on non-x86 are able to
generate PCI MMIO cycles in that range though. Some do provide a special
window for this tho.

Usually, you know the device will before using it. Like using the VGA
memory space on a VGA card etc...

Yes, not all bridges allow generations of those cycles, but it's useful
to have an interface letting things like X map this space in a proper
way that can also deal with domains etc... for platforms where this
space exists.

There is some work done by Jon Smirl in this area (a VGA access
arbitration driver).
