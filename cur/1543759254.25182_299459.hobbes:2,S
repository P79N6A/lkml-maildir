Been trying to achieve that since it's a FAQ on ARM lists.  Even gone to
the extent of setting up a separate mailing list, getting a volunteer to
track what people want and do the hard work to build them.  That was
about 6 months ago, and I haven't seen any results.
I was thinking at the time "great, this is one problem which should be
solved".  How silly of me.  It seems, yet again, that it comes down to
a case of "if rmk doesn't do it, it won't get done."  Sad but true.
Now, why do I keep feeling that I'm being taken advantage of all the
time?  Could it be the complete lack of productive help from anyone else.
Anyway, going back to why -mm doesn't work:
 arch/arm/kernel/built-in.o(.init.text+0xb64): In function `$a':
 : undefined reference to `rd_size'
 make[1]: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
So "rd_size" got deleted in -mm kernels without reference to anyone else
who's using it.  Greeeeaaatttt....
