Hi Linus,
In case you didn't notice yet:
Line 170 in ./net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c "ret = 0" is bogus and missing ';'
        int ret = 0;
        SOCKHASH_LOCK_WRITE();
        tb = tcp_bhash[tcp_bhashfn(snum)];
        for( ; (tb && (tb->port != snum)); tb = tb->next)
                ;
-->>    ret = 0
        if (tb == NULL) {
                if ((tb = tcp_bucket_create(snum)) == NULL)
                        ret = 1;
        }
        SOCKHASH_UNLOCK_WRITE();
I think it shows up only with CONFIG_IP_TRANSPARENT_PROXY, and it is
introduced in the pre3-2.3.10 patch.

Argh!  All right, so how am I supposed to work with Linux when
everything's already been done?!  Can't these people leave some
broken MSDOS like parts so there's problems left to solve!?....
