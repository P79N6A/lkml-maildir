I can agree that we need good solution for that.
BUT I don't think I didn't setup *silly* situation. my customers who
are reporting this problem, running firewall on linux which is
forwarding packets with high rate.
I don't want to say 'don't ifconfig down, don't reboot, don't
shutdown' it would introduce problem on your such *sily* sitution'.
In addition, my laptop is just connected to another *linux* machine
which is generating 300mbps 64byte udp packets infinitely.
