I'm currently working with the original authors of sata_mv, and have taken
over maintenance of it for now.  It should progress from "highly experimental"
to "production quality" over the next month or so.
The (mucho) updated driver I'm using here now is already much improved
in many ways.  At some point, I'll break it out into patches for Jeff.
But there's one MAJOR bugfix patch that I'll release here shortly,
to go with the interrupt handler fix already posted.
Cheers
Mark
