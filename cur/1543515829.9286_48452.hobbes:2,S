That sounds very similar to how the BAYCOM serial driver works, and
that already has a Linux driver. Look in `make menuconfig` under...

...and investigate the two arrowed entries. I believe the files of
interest (in the 2.2.13 kernel tree) are...
	baycom_ser_fdx.c
	baycom_ser_hdx.c

Even easier would have been to drop a MAX232 chip at their end and use
the standard RS232 interface - or alternatively design to connect to
the parallel port. I've done both of those with my designs in the
past, and they make the whole thing VERY easy to program under DOS,
and in the case of the parallel port version, I've written BASIC code
for the Sinclair ZX-81 that was more than adequate...

Personally, I'd be very tempted to connect it to some of the pins on
the parallel port and code a driver to use it that way, but if it has
to be a serial port, use the BAYCOM design for ideas...
Best wishes from Riley.

    includes separate sublists both for each kernel series, and for
    each year of development.
