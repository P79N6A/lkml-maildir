I recall from discussions earlier that noinline doesn't fix the
problem, and I just tested a similar case and verified that adding
noinline doesn't stop some versions of gcc from inlining them.  The
empty weak functions in kernel/perf_counter.c were getting inlined by
the cross-gcc (gcc 4.1.1) I use for compiling powerpc kernels on my
laptop, and adding noinline doesn't help there.
