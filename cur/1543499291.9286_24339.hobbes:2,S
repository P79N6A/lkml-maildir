I remember reading somewhere about patches for both Win9x and WinNT to
deal with this problem. As far as I can recall, the patch makes WinXX
treat a ZipDisk as a floppy drive as far as bootup is concerned, so it
doesn't consider running chkdsk/scandisk on them...
Mick: I believe you grabbed the Win9x version, but do you know
anything about a WinNT version?
Best wishes from Riley.
