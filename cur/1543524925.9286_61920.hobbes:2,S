glibc malloc is able to use mmap, plus have a lot of tunable things.
See mallopt(3), particularly M_MMAP_THRESHOLD and M_MMAP_MAX parameters.
The default mmap threshold (above which malloc uses mmap) is I think 128K,
but you can decrease it. But it does not make much sense to decrease this
below PAGE_SIZE, because you then waste a lot of memory.
