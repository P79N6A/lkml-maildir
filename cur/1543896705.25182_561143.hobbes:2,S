Well yes, I'm assuming that the goal is successfully concluded
negotiations.  If in fact the idea is to force people to wedge
themselves into an undefensible corner so that you can blame the
failed negotiations on *them*, when it was really *you* who had no
interest in reaching a mutually agreeable compromise, then of course
that could be a valid tactic.  That's a bit of an advanced technique,
though; and some might call it a tad slimeball thing to do.  Happens
all the time in political and labor discussions, though!
I hope that wasn't want Alexandre was trying to do, although at times
where one could wonder if he was really sent by Tivo to make sure the
kernel would stay GPLv2.  :-)
