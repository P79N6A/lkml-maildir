why not do what i suggested: refactor do_page_fault() into a platform 
specific / kernel-internal faults and into a generic-user-pte function. 
That alone would increase readability i suspect.
Then the 'retry' is multiple calls from handle_pte_fault().
Or something like that.
It looks wrong to me to pass another flag through this hot codepath, just 
to express a property that the _highlevel_ code is interested in.
