If you look in <linux/blkdev.h>, you can see the definition of
REQ_TYPE_LINUX_BLOCK and the current sub commands (none are implemented
right now). So you want to add REQ_LB_OPT_PARK (or whatever the name
should be) to implement the freezing operation, and then add support for
the drivers to understand this command and do what they need to do. You
can add block layer helpers to perform the freezing of the actual queue,
to be called when the PARK command completes. You can handle the queue
draining for tagged devices like the barriers do for FUA barriers.
