I looked into it 2 weeks ago, and i couldn't find a complete voltage
table for the Dothan C1 stepping (which my laptop has). I only found a
table with (IIRC) the max and min voltages for the max and min
frequencies. I also didn't understand the meaning of the different
VID#{A,B,C,D,E} values. Are these voltages related to the quality of the
power supply, or the quality of the processor? How do we know which one
to choose?
