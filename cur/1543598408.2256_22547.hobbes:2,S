Hello All,
I was wondering, if suspending a specific process into disk and
resuming from the disk after a reboot is possible.  Let's assume
that the process in question has a couple of open files for r/w,
say on ext2, if it makes difference, and it isn't using any
network connection.
It could be very useful, if you have to reboot the system while
your cpu-monster application is running for a long time...
Sometimes, I have to delay a necessary (minor) kernel update
because of week-long processes.
Regards,
Taylan
