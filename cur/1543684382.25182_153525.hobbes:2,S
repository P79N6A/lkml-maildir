I think this was just virgin -mm1, I can go back and double check ...
Not sure what the stuff about backing out other peoples patches was
all about, I just pointed out the crash.
Andrew had backed out highpmd for other reasons before I even mailed
this out, if that's what your knickers are all twisted about ... I have
no evidence that was causing the problem ... merely that it goes away
on -test2-mm1 ... it was Andrew's suggestion, not mine.
