    Well, barring something horrible like e820 returning bogus values
    that the kernel takes as gospel (what do the memory region: kernel
    messages say?), it may be the problem the fellow from fujitsu
    reported (boundary conditions -- the one horrible flaw I've got as a
    programmer :-( )
    Could you try this patch and see if it makes any difference (I don't
    think that mm/init.c has changed since then):
