Yes? And if it cares to do umount first? _If_ you have processes running
around and fooling with mounts - keep the mounted stuff busy, you have no
other warranty. On any UNIX. Or, better yet, don't have such processes.

Too bad, a lot of Unices do not follow that rule. Check yourself. Linux
(since _very_ long, if not from the day 1) too. Heck, IIRC v7 allows to
mount on /foo/bar/baz and then mount on /foo.

Lack of that does not add you _any_ safety. Again, if fs is not busy - it
_can_ be replaced. Takes two system calls instead of one - BFD, they
require exactly the same privileges. It may be a problem, but it's _not_ a
security problem. It does not add any new privileges - same effect could
always be achieved by combination of umount() and mount().
