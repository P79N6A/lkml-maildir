No, I think I was. I was trying to follow the way that USB does it (e.g. usblp 
linking into the usb sysfs class) but I think you are right - IEEE1394 is in a 
different situation. raw1394 is the only ieee1394 driver (as far as I can see) 
that might benefit fitting into a generic class. I think we should stick with 
class_simple and possibly consider a generic class if more drivers might 
require it in the future.
