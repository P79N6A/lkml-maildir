Actually, not necessarily.
The thing is, _the_ most common reason I have for opening the box is that 
the effing thing started having problems.
At which point I want to just remove the disk, move it to another box, and 
boot up the other box.
And THAT is exactly the kind of situation where I sure as hell don't want
to care exactly where the disk was. I can't "prepare" for it by editing
files in /etc, since I don't know that the CPU fan or whatever is going to
die on me.
And this is _exactly_ why we should try to get away from device numbering
having any meaning. Because if we do this right, something like the CPU
fan dying, and me moving a disk to a new machine that has SATA (with the
disk having both SATA and PATA connectors), I shouldn't need to even
_think_ about it.
That's where "mount by label" does part of the job. But if the system is 
_always_ set up to do things like NFS exports according to some separate 
UUID, that too would "just work".
There's a lot to be said for "just work".  Even if sometimes it takes some 
pain when you break old (and broken) assumptions.

Those are them fighting words.
But since you brought it up: do you actually have anything else that can
open a remote IMAP file with a few thousand messages without taking ages
for it, and that you don't have to mouse around with? I'd like a graphical
interface for configuring stuff etc, but I sure as hell don't want to find
some f*ing icon to save a few messages that I selected in-order to my
"doit" queue or go to the next one, or pipe the thing to a shell-script,
or any number of things that are my actual _job_.
And the "no mousing" means that I don't want to have some popup window 
that asks me what file I want to save into or similar crap. I can type 
fast enough if I stay on the keyboard and can focus on one part of the 
screen, but if I have to switch my focus around, I'm a goner.
On a related matter, I'm probably a retard, but I've tried alternatives to
"trn" too, and there really aren't any. None of the graphical news readers
can show me one full page of threads, select the 3-4 threads from _that_
one page that I want (from the keyboard), and then kill _that_ one page.
Not the whole newsgroup: only the part that shows in the window at that
time.
In "trn", the magic command is capital-D, for "discard".
