Much simpler: IRET frame to return to user is
already there. Just push another one to return
to ring1 first.

popl %esp (as per Petr Vandrovec's suggestion)
The value on stack is carefully prepared on ring0.

Works!

I allocate it on a ring0 stack. Noone seem to
suggest that. Is this flawed for some reasons?

For what? We can have that fixed so why not?

I do actually:
larl OLDSS(%esp), %eax
testl $0x00400000, %eax
which is exactly two insns.
Since I've forgot to CC the patch to you, I uploaded
it here:

so that you (or anyone interested) can make a review.
