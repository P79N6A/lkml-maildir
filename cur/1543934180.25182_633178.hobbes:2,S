Thats a different problem. The kernel as I've said many times has no

- removing expired/missing maintainers
- handling stuff that decays
- removing dead documentation
- removing dead drivers and ports
Although you've certainly started on fixing much of that.

So why not fix the wrong tags, and mark smbfs obsolete ?
