What I meant was, the new module implements a network driver which proceeds 
to do atomic allocs.

One thing I am hearing from some developers is that we don't need to solve 
the high-order allocation problems because they are really driver issues - 
all drivers should be changed to use scatter-gather or some such.  I don't 
know if that's correct, this would require knowledge of all driver types and 
archs which I can't begin to claim.
I'm quite sure we can fix this up though, not to the point of being able to 
guarantee all high order allocations, but to the point where we have a high 
probability of success under all loads, as opposed to what we have now which 
is very fragile, and not just in the Linus tree.
