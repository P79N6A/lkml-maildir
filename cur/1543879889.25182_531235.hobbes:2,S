There is no reluctance to submit the NFS-RDMA code for review. There 
have been several upstream changes to the NFS server recently. We 
(NetApp and Tom Tucker at OGC) are working on a new patchset for 
NFS-RDMA that is compatible with these changes. We are testing the 
code now. 
We will post the patches for review when we finish updating them.
