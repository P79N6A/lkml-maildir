   I think that is the real issue. We're mapping something - probably a host
   bridge - at address 0, and then accessing RAM (which is also is mapped at 
   PCI address 0) and the host bridge is unhappy.
We're current blindly putting ~0 in there, how can that be any
better? :-)
   
   So excluding the change is probably the right thing to do - it's just 
   fundamentally buggy to blindly put a base register at zero.
   
And putting ~0 there is ok?
From what you're saying, that whole routine is fundamentally broken.
