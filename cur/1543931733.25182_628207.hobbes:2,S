That hasn't helped I'm afraid.
However I think it actually does affect all three systems running
this kernel after all, the problme only manifests itself faster on
oni.
Meanwhile I added a slab statistic rrd script. Nothing obvious to
see on ari or yumi yet, but on oni (which after all is the most
affected by this) I can see 'size_2048' and 'TCPv6' growing
steadily along with the route cache size (Presumably 'ip_dst_cache',
which is also growing larger at a more or less constant rate).

You can see that the difference on ari and yumi was also growing
until they were rebooted (in the beginning of december for ari,
beginning of november for yumi).
Currently all three are running 2.6.23.9 and the problem is still
there.
