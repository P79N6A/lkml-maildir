Do you have a specific example? What I've seen so far (especially cris was 
full of it), was more used to override the user (and only worked with 
'make oldconfig' anyway). Only because most users want to include specific 
drivers, doesn't mean all users have to include these drivers. I'm a bit 
afraid such a feature would be easily misused.
It sounds more like you want an autoconf, which generates a machine 
specific config. E.g. ppc already delivers several config files for 
different machines, which are selected with 'make <mach>_config'. Going 
into this direction sounds like a better idea.
bye, Roman
