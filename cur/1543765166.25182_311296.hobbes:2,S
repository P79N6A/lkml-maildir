I don't know of any AoE users that read the lkml.  Except me, of
course.
> 2) Is anyone on the list using AOE in combination with md and/or LVM2?
Yes, most AoE users use md.  Many use LVM2, but a couple have had
trouble with striped volume groups.

People are using AoE on 64 bit platforms and not reading the lkml.  :)
