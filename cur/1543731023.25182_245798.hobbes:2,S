OK, real world example.  My roommate has an AKAI MPC-2000, a very
popular hardware sampler from the 90's.  The disk format is known,there
are a few utilities to edit the disks on a PC and extract the PCM
samples, but there are no tools to mount it on a modern PC.  Are you
saying that, since I know the MPC disk format, I could write a reiser4
plugin to mount an MPC drive?
If so, then Hans has an excellent point.  Users do want this kind of
thing, and it is worth having to fix tar et al.
