Hello,
I do not remember the webmaster email address of kernel.org so I am
sending this here.
Accessing 
http://kernel.org
 results in:
Forbidden
You don't have permission to access / on this server.
Additionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an
ErrorDocument to handle the request.
Regards,
Maciej
