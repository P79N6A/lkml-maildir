	100 Hz means your minimum scheduling interval is 10 milliseconds,
	and *sleep() guarantees *at least* parametrized amount of sleep,
	not *exactly* parametrized amount of sleep.
	There are also odd reasons in timer code, why HZ of power of two
	is best, instead of some "nice" 100 or 1000 ...
	(Jiffies to  'struct timeval', I vaguely recall..)

	How long IRQ processing takes *does* depend upon used chips.
	When the IRQ-controller is in modern core-logic chipsets, it
	does not need to behave like its ancient ISA-bus-bound precursors.

	RTC based interrupts ?  Highly accurate periodic interrupts,
	not re-sceduling based "regular by luck"...
