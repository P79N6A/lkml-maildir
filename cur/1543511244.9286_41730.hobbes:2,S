I am writing a client/server program in userspace. The server listens() on a
socket and does a pthread_create() when a connection comes in and listens()
on...
The created thread answers the request and then shutsdown() and closes() the
socket filedescriptor. I am checking for errors and non occure. everything
fine.
Now I wanted to check 'multi-threaded-ness' of the mini-progi and start a
client with 
# while (echo 1); do (client localhost;) done
It seems to work fine until the 1024th connection is requested. 
then everything halts (both programs, not the system. That keeps running.)
#netstat -an 
tells me, that around 1024 ports are in use and they all have the status TIME
WAIT.
It takes some time until all sockets are freed again. then I can rerun the
experiment. 
Why are the ports in 'TIME WAIT' status? Were they not closed properly? Can I
speed this process up? Where is the problem?
Even if I leave client and server after they halted and wait till all the TIME
WAIT -connections ended, they do not run on. I would have expected that at
least. 
#netstat -an 
shows just the server listening and nothing else.
