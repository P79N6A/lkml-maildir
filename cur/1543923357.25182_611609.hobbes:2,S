Well the unix way is to implement it simple and stupid and then to
optimize, where needed.  We don't currently have a per pid namespace
list of processes or tasks.
This is a trivial bug fix patch, and I wanted the review to be as
simple as possible.
I don't expect people are doing kill -1 all that frequently as it is a
bit rude.
I have no problem doing find_ge_pid and then looking in the hash table
like we do in /proc.  It likely will have fewer conflicts, but that
is a bit harder to review, and is actually more code.
