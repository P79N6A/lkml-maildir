Up and running here:

Nothing of interest in dmesg. The issue I reported earlier about
/var/log/messages has been there for a long time without me noticing
it. I'm in 2.6.23-rt1 and I still see it so it has nothing to do with
the kernel as I'm sure you decided already.
Jan 16 11:12:55 lightning sshd[5915]: Server listening on :: port 22.
Jan 16 11:12:55 lightning sshd[5915]: error: Bind to port 22 on
0.0.0.0 failed: Address already in use.
Will continue testing as I get time.
Cheers,
Mark
