Hi dear linux guru,
I have an ATI XPert@Play AGP 8Mb graphic card.
Until the version pre4 I couldn't recognize my card...
But starting from pre5 I can recognize it, but the boot hangs at the
very begining (about after two seconds) and I have only trash on the
screen?
Has someone managed using it?
Is it possible that way to have linux on the TV?
Sincerely yours,
        Greg                            mailto:greg@imaux.unil.ch
