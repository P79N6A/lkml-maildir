gcc flat out miscompiled such inlines last I checked (Zwane shipped the
bugreport IIRC). Either this kind of good behavior is not universally
observable or a miracle occurred and gcc's codegen went from incorrect
to 1980's (fscking patents).
Anyhow, this was also an observation of the code effectively made in
isolation; uninlining and other catastrophes do happen.
If people really thinks this works and/or don't care when it doesn't,
go for it. Last time I heard they did; who knows, the answer may be
different this time.
