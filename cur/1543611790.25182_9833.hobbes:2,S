Not 100% kernel related ... but ... 
Anyone know where I can find the latest NBD stuff? Esp. client/server
code?
I looked at Pavel's website and the nbd.14.tar.gz file are from '98 and
'99.
Is their anything newer that works with the nbd kernel module?
Oh ... And one more question what's the best 2.4.X kernel to use with
nbd?
