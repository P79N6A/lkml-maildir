I've got a 250GB Seagate Barracuda 7200.10 (ST3250820AS) with firmware
3.AAE on it here that seems to suffer from the same problem hang
problem as a number of similar seagate drives.  What information do I
need to provide to get it added to the blacklist?  Beyond that I'm
also going through seagate support to try to get a firmware upgrade
for the thing, as performance without NCQ tends to be not-so-good.
Kernel messages of the SATA error below (it's on an ICH controller of
some variety).
Cheers,
