One of my common complaints about massive ext3 updates such as this is 
the ever-growing "which ext3 filesystem am I mounting?" problem.
I really think extents and 48bit-ness should imply
	cp -a fs/ext3 fs/ext4
and go from there.
IMHO the ext3 back-compat situation is already really hairy, with all 
the features added since the original ext3 release.
The alternative is continual bloating of ext3, and on filesystems, 
inodes which are progressively upgraded -- meaning any use of a prior 
kernel implies that you can only read a subset of your [meta]data, if 
the back-compat code doesn't block the mount entirely.
People (including me) still switch back and forth between ext2 and ext3 
mounts of the same filesystem on occasion.  I think creating an "ext4" 
would allow for greater developer flexibility in implementing new 
features and ditching old ones -- while also emphasizing to the user 
that switching back and forth between ext4 and ext[23] is a bad idea.
Overall, after applying extent (and 48bit) patches, I think it is wrong 
to keep calling it ext3.  That will break some existing user 
assumptions, and continue to restrict developers' freedom to implement 
nifty new features.
