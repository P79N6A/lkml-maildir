Hi,
     We have been using the net2280 chip (usb 2.0) as a usb target
printer device. We have been seeing data corruption problems
during a bulk out transfer when data is taken out the device
quite slow.  The corruption size is only 4 bytes suggesting
a device problem. Is anyone using this chip and has anyone
encountered similar problem?
Is there any other 2.0 usb chip that can be used as a target mode
device?
