just an idea (maybe it's not that new, plz don't flame me...).
couldn't one think about a filesystem beeing just a database
including several possibilities of structuring 
(structure as a method defined right before access fitting the
specific needs of that access) and with several levels of access
allowing different "views" for different userlevels?
of course, this is just a theoretical view, there still would have
to be found a proper implementation allowing a 
reasonable performance...
