Yes. If the mounts were just slave than they could be a slave member of
their corresponding master pnode, i.e p0 and p1 respectively. But 
in my example above they are also shared. And a shared mount could be
bind mounted with propagation set in either direction. Hence they
deserve a separate pnode.  If it was just a slave mount then binding to
it would not set any propagation and hence there need not be a separate
pnodes to track the propagation.
Just for clarification:
1. a slave mount is represented as a slave member of a pnode.
2. a shared mount is represented as a member of a  pnode.
3. a slave as well as a shared mount is represented a member of
	separate pnode, which in itself is a slave pnode.
4. a private mount is not part of any pnode.
5. a unclone mount is also not part of any pnode.

Yes. This can be done in a single step. And in fact in my latest patches
that I sent yesterday I did exactly that. It works. All that messy
PNODE_UP,PNODE_DOWN,PNODE_MID is all gone. Code has become
much simpler.
The reason this was there earlier was that I was thinking we may need
all these phases for some operations like umount, make_mounted.. 
But as I understand the operations better I am convinced that it is not
required, and you reconfirm that point :)
