Well, you're incorrect about my not using cryptoloop. Sorry I wasn't
convincing enough. :)

I don't think you'll get 5000 replies... about anything. ;)

I don't buy the "conflicts with the advancement" part, but I'll defer to
your judgement. ;)

I believe 1) the current documentation already notifies people of the
security issues, 2) there are workarounds, and 3) the replacement has
security issues of its own.
Dm-crypt is still unstable, doesn't have all the features of cryptoloop
(please see my previous message), yet you wish to dump cryptoloop? At
least cryptoloop is a known quantity.
Once dm-crypt can be shown to have all the features of the software it's
meant to _replace_, I'll be more likely to agree. Otherwise, it sounds
like this decision is being made on a whim.
