Dear Valdis:
   I also download from kernel.org 2.5.50, it have error at make modules 
or make install
   after I downloan another patch-ac1 or mm1,  and patch it with 2.5.50, 
recompile(I mean make modules or make install)  it still have error, (I 
ever email the author)
   I just wonder how do you successful compile or install that 2.5.50? 
do you meet error at make modules?  if yes, how do you do ?(modify by 
yourself or postto author or public waiting for reply?)
   highly appreciate your experience on compile or install new kernel 
especailly experiamental kernel
sincere ERic
