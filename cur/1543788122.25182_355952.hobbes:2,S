 again - depinit.
 the only thing that richard lightman didn't spend time on was the
 splitting out of hotplug / hotplug scripts such that depinit could be
 told "okay the ethernet's up now, all eth0 dependencies can now proceed"
 or "okay the scsi controller is up now, all fstab entries depending
 on this controller can now proceed".
 richard's example scripts split out "var", "usr", "home", "boot" as
 separate dependencies (actually they're symlinks to the "mount"
 pseudo-dependency) on which things like pretty much all services 
 that need to do syslogging depend on the "var" dependency you get the
 idea.
 so as long as it's hotplug that gets the notifications, great.
 if it's _not_ hotplug that's receiving the notifications, such that
 device driver initialisation cannot be delayed because you're looking at
 calling some boot-rom initialisation stuff, then, sorry, nope - you're
 gonna have to just wait for that SCSI controller to get its act
 together :)
 but again, this is off-topic for the original discussion and is again
 userspace not kernel oh well, in for a penny in for a pound.
