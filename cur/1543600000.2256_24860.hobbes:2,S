Rik's patch can be optimized a lot by using a direct pointer to the pte in the
nonshared case, and perhaps a null rmap pointer in the kernel-only case (e.g.,
page cache).  If the non-optimized version is already performing better than the
traditional approach it's a very good sign.  This needs careful confirmation.
Measurements where you force your system into continuous swapping would be very
interesting.
