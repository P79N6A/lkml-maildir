Yes, they do have additional restrictions (mutex_trylock() illegal from
contexts that cannot sleep, mutexes may only be unlocked by tasks
that took them in the first place). But note that these are
_implementation_ sanity checks that were introduced to catch
nonsensical usage, which was possible (and not explicitly being
guarded against, because of the generic-ness that was needed to
be maintained for the counted case too) with the "semaphore"s.

I do mean precisely that. I really cannot think of any sensible / normal
usage case of binary semaphores that cannot be replaced with either
mutexes (if that's the kind of locking you actually want) or completion
handlers (if that's the kind of synchronization you actually want).
