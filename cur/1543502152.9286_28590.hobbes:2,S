Subject: 2.3.9 bug: uninterruptible processes stuck in __find_lock_page

Linus:
This is an SMP 2.3.9 kernel on a dual-processor machine.  I can't see
anything in pre-patch-2.3.10-5 that would obviously fix this problem,
but the locking changes are too complicated for me to follow.
I have an Emacs process in state TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE stuck at the
"schedule()" call in "mm/filemap.c:__find_lock_page".  It appears to
never leave this state and accumulates no CPU time, so presumably it's
just that no one's unlocking whatever page it's waiting on.  There are
no messages in the kernel ring buffer.
NFS isn't compiled in, so I can eliminate one context in which
"find_lock_page" is used; the others are in "generic_file_write" and
"lookup_swap_cache".  When I tried "swapoff -a", the "swapoff" process
got stuck in the same place, so I'm guessing that the culprit is
"lookup_swap_cache": something's locked a swap cache page and isn't
letting it go.
Note that I use a single swapfile on an "ext2" partition.
For what it's worth, after the "swapoff -a", "/proc/meminfo" shows:
        total:    used:    free:  shared: buffers:  cached:
Mem:  64540672 61157376  3383296 44216320   499712 31244288
Swap:        0        0        0
while "/proc/swaps" shows:
Filename                        Type            Size    Used	Priority
/usr/SWAPS/swap.0               file            49996   3940    -1
This is certainly what would be expected if "sys_swapoff" had blocked
in "sys_swapoff" -> "try_to_unuse" -> "read_swap_cache_async" ->
"lookup_swap_cache" -> "find_lock_page", since the flags for my
swapfile would be "SWP_USED", so "si_swapinfo" would skip counting it
in generating info for "/proc/meminfo".
Also, Shift-ScrollLock shows:
Mem-info:

10*4kB 82*8kB 26*16kB 1*32kB 1*64kB 1*128kB 1*256kB 0*512kB 0*1024kB
0*2048kB = 1592kB)

I've tried to wade through the swapfile/lock interactions, but I can't
figure it out, so I hope this helps track the problem down.
