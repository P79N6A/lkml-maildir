Thanks!  It looks much better now.
With X nice'd at -10, and 11 hogs loading the cpu, interactivity looks good 
until the default timeslice/quota is exhausted and slows down.  Maybe 
adjusting this according to nice could help.
It may also be advisable to fix latencies according to nice, and adjust 
timeslices instead.  This may help scaleability a lot, as there are some 
timing sensitive apps that may crash under high load.
Thanks!
