And get_mail must have elevated privileges to search for the users mail...
or sendmail must have already switched user on reciept to put it in the
users inbox which also requires privleges...
And an additional daemon (owned by the user) is yet another attack point...
Cron could be used to batch message handling... as long as it runs before
the users quota is used up. This becomes the same as using IMAP or fetchmail
to download it.
It's much more efficent to process each mail as it arrives.
All this does is move the program that requires privileges to somewhere
else. It doesn't eliminate it.
Granted, sendmail could use a better implementation of a security model.
