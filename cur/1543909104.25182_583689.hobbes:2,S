That's the problem. Other than either going through interrupt gates *and* keeping
interrupts disabled long enough, there's nothing you can do, except turning of
tracing before re-enabling interrupts, which in turn you would likely reject because
of the performance overhead of the necessary rdmsr/wrmsr pair.

I considered this, but decided against it due to the address pair being displayed.
But I could certainly change that.

Okay, if you consider emulators important here (this is one of the reasons for
having to turn on the feature via command line option).

Apart from the above, I assume it's also useful initially to avoid boot problems
in case the model->msr mapping isn't fully cooked, yet (obviously I don't have
machines with all the different CPU families/models around to test, so the coding
of what I wasn't able to test is purely based on the manuals).

So especially with the first concern of yours - is it worth at all rev-ing this
patch to address the other change requests you voiced?

That shouldn't be too difficult.
