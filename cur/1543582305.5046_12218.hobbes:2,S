	I think their "innovation" was not requiring the optical cross
grid mouse pad common on Sun workstations over the years.  The Microsoft
optical mouse uses variations in the surface characteristics of whatever
it's on to perform it's function.  The old optical mice just used two
different colors of LED's (red and IR) and a special pad.  This would
actually have to scan and track the surface below it.  Don't know that
I've seen anyone do that before.
