Um, NTFS uses address spaces for things where ->host is not an inode at all 
so doing host->i_sb will give you god knows what but certainly not a super 
block!
As long as your patches don't break that is possible to have I am happy... 
But from what you are saying above I have a bad feeling you are somehow 
assuming that a mapping's host is an inode...
