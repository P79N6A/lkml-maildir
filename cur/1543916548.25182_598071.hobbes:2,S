How does this equate/give message numbers?

long long would not work either.
Perhaps it's better to scan the format string or indirect the
printk formatting logic.
Another possibility:
An added pass between gcc preprocessor and compiler could compact
or compress the format string without modifying the conversion
specifications so __attribute__ ((format (printf)) would still work.
printk could expand the compacted/compressed format.
