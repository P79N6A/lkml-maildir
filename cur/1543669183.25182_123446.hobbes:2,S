Hi *,
On Saturday I tried a Seagate 120GiB SATA with my onboard SiI3112 on
my ASUS P4G8X (with an Intel 7205 chipset). I suppose that David is
using a similiar setup with an 7505 chipset? Perhaps the problem is
somehow related to this chipset: I saw the exact same errors as David.
I also tried several kernels: 2.4.20-ac2, 2.4.20-pre5-ac3, 2.4.20-pre7,
2.5.66, 2.4.20-8 from Redhat 9, ... with exactly the same result.
