   Talk to David about the problems with an external CVS tree, he had many of
   the same problems with his sparc/networking tree a long time ago. David, 
   maybe you can talk about how you solved them.
I basically tried to send patches on a daily basis.
If that failed... then I ended up with this huge diff
that I had to pick apart by hand like Alan does when merging
-ac bits.
Then I started to use bitkeeper, and I didn't have to go
through the pain of importing a new set of 2.5.x vanilla
changes before a merge.
