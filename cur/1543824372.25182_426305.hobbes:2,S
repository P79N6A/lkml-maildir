Hi Brice,
Sorry this review is based on your previous submission, I just noticed
it was still sitting in my mailbox. Please ignore anything that has been
fixed in the meantime :)

You go to a lot of trouble to align things. One thing on ppc64 is that
we really want to start all DMA writes on a cacheline boundary. We
enforce that in network drivers by making NET_IP_ALIGN = 0 and having
the drivers do:
skb_reserve(skb, NET_IP_ALIGN);
It sounds like your small allocations will be only aligned to 16 bytes.

Id suggest using the dma API instead of the pci API. We have seen
machines in the field that have failed large pci_alloc_consistent calls
because it always asks for GFP_ATOMIC memory (it presumes the worst).
The dma API allows you to pass a GFP_ flag in which will have a much
better chance of succeeding when you dont need GFP_ATOMIC memory.

Not sure how we are meant to specify write through in drivers. Any ideas Ben?
