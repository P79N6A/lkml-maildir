Subject: [patch] pagecache locking bugfix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/4/18/56

The bug which Anton found.  On the
find_or_create_page->__find_lock_page path we're performing
a read_unlock of an rwlock which is held for writing.
The patch converts that to using a write_lock throughout.
Which penalises find_lock_page() a bit.  If it shows up
on profiles then we can clone __find_lock_page() and
use read_lock()s, but for now I'd opt for saving the
cache footprint.
