just on a side note, the msp3400 code is broken a bit.  still hasn't been
fixed since i mentioned it :)
my card has a tda/tea, but the bttv insists on looking for and erroring on the
msp3400:

bttv0: Brooktree Bt848 (rev 18) bus: 0, devfn: 72, irq: 9, memory: 0xe2000000. 
bttv: 1 Bt8xx card(s) found. 
bttv0: audio chip: TDA9850 
bttv0: fader chip: TEA6300

msp34xx: I/O error #2 (read 0x12/0x1e) 
msp34xx: I/O error #3 (read 0x12/0x1e) 
msp34xx: giving up, reseting chip. Sound will go off, sorry folks :-| 
msp34xx: I/O error #1 (read 0x12/0x1f) 
msp34xx: I/O error #2 (read 0x12/0x1f)
