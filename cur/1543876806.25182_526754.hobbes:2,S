One thing, Jeremy, which I think is being a bit misleading here: you're 
focusing on big, performance-critical stuff.  Those things are going to 
be the ones which has the most win to implement in hypervisor-specific 
ways.  Although we can offer models for some hypervisors (and G-d knows 
there are enough implementations out there of virtual disk which are 
almost identical), they're clearly not going to be universal.
However, there are other things; console is some, or my original 
example, which was random number generation.  For those, the benefit of 
unification is proportionally greater, simply because the win of 
anything hypervisor-specific is much smaller.
