There have been a number of messages about this phenomenon since 2.3.23
came out.
The kernel builds fine.  At load time, right after decompression there
is an immediate BIOS-type reboot.
Linus had posted that he had seen this due to a bug when booting SMP
kernels on a UP machine, but I and at least one other person who has
posted to Linux Kernel do not have that situation.  Other putative
causes have been stale versions of gcc and binutils--I have upgraded
both to the latest stables.  Also one other person thought it was due to
have APM enabled in the BIOS, and that, too, has been ruled out in my
case.
If anyone who has gotten to the bottom of this I'd sure be obliged for a
pointer. I have raked the digests and it appears that there are a small
number of us in this same boat.
I have run all 2.3 kernels just fine, modulo a couple of blips due to
the PPP rewrite.
Thanks.
B.
