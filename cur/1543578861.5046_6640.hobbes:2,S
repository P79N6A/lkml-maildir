My adapter configuration utility needs to instruct the user which physical
adapter needs attention ( when there may be multiple adapters in the system
).    My question is :  How do I determine the ( machine ) slot number of a
PCI adapter ?
In BIOS and other OS's this may be doneby examining the system's  PCI
Routing Tables.    I don't think I can get to those from Linux.
PCI Devices are defined by  BUS,  DEVICE, and FUNCTION.    In Linux there
is a function ( defined in pci.h near the end of the file ) called   "
PCI_SLOT( devfn ) "   but from what I can see this returns what PCI calls
the device.   PCI device is not the machine's slot number.   This function
even uses the encoded byte which is named  devfn  ( I assume from PCI
device and PCI function ) ,   but this function treats it as slot and
function.
Any help is appreciated.  Thanks in advance.
