Yup, yup, I definitely want to pursue it. I want Linux e-paper
displays to be zippy. :-) Agreed, I will do bitmask read and write.
Hey, wait a sec, bitmask write definitely. but bitmask read is
peculiar to me. I can understand the caller would want to do something
like foo = gpio_get_values(gpio, bitwidth). But would they really want
to do foo = gpio_get_values(gpio, bitwidth, bitmask) rather than deal
with it appropriately themselves?

Ok, you've scared me there. I only have a Gumstix board so I can do it
for the pxa255 but will need help if more platforms are needed.
Exploiting this opportunity for hardware whoring, if anyone wants to
send me free hardware, I'll be ecstatic and will eagerly do support
duty on said platforms. :-)

Understood. I will make it optional. Does
CONFIG_GPIOLIB_MULTIBIT_ACCESS sound okay?

Yes, my goal with this was to get started and get feedback early. :-)

Ok, I didn't understand this part. I think you mentioned a higher
level interface before but I didn't fully understand, if not gpiolib,
then at what level do you recommend?
Thanks,
