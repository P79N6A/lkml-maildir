In Petr's case it looks like his switch produces a single well-defined
byte (0x41) when switching. What about you? Do you get garbage at the
moment of switching, or always the same code(s)?
Do you only get the spurious repeat when switching?
Andrew gets spurious repeats together with mouse activity. Do you?
I am especially interested in cases where people can reproduce
an unwanted key repeat. The question is: is this a bug in our timer code
or use of timers, or did the keyboard never send the key release code?
