Thats a stupid question. The tools people normally use can just fine.

Point made - Adrian, if the tool complains about UTF-8 in author texts
then its buggy and should not be merged. The fact you have a personal
issue with it is neither here nor there

Using UTF-8 not 8859-1 for consistency is sensible, especially as 8859-1
is obsolete and effectively useless now (although I guess much of the
'8859-1' in the kernel is 1:1 with 8859-15, which isn't so obsolete but
is just as useless)
