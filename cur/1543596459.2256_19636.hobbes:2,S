Could this be a 2.4 swap issue. You NEED at least RAM x2 swap. If you're
just adding memory to
a box that's stable with 128 megs and possibly 256 megs swap (you don't
state, just guessing..)
you've now got too little swap, and boom, stability goes bye-bye.
Just haven't seen the swap issue mentioned this thread...
