Sure, but perhaps it does assume all accesses to this bitmap are going
through the set_bit functions. e.g. consider an implementation that
uses a spinlock for this - parisc seems to do that for example
from a quick look into their bitops.h. And they have an 64bit kernel
too.
In this case part of the unsigned long could be accessed directly 
using the aliasing.
