well, this particular function should only be used by the rt-mutex 
subsystem, because it sets the priority of a task unconditionally.  
Priority will vary depending on how other tasks block on a lock held by 
this task. So if some other subsystem changes the priority via this 
interface, it will both interfere with PI, and PI will interfere with 
this.
