The following serie of 8 patches contains:
x86: fix Section mismatch warning in srat_64.c
=> straightforward - please apply
x86: fix Section mismatch warning in mcheck/mce_64.c
=> I took some assumptions on use of notifier.
   See comments and please review before applying
x86: fix Section mismatch warning in mcheck/mce_amd_64.c
=> Same comments as for previous patch
x86: fix Section mismatch warning in topology.c
=> Straightforward - please apply.
   I made EXPORT of arch_register_cpu independent on config in this patch
   as I do not see why we want to do otherwise.
x86: fix Section mismatch warning in process_*.c
=> Strightforward - please apply
x86: fix Section mismatch warning in acpi/boot.c
=> Strightforward - please apply
x86: fix Section mismatch warning in early-quirks.c
=> Strightforward - please apply
x86: fix Section mismatch warning in setup_64.c
=> Strightforward - please apply
All warnigns were generated with a 64 bit defconfig with
latest kbuild.git patches applied.
You should not expect to see identical warnings neither
the same amount of them.
There are a few warnings left but they await any feedback
on the __ref annotation before I address these.
And they will likely depens on having kbuild.git
applied.
So the remaining warnings in arch/x86/ will not
be addressed until both kbuild.git and x86.git has been merged.
Patches follows unnumbered as they are independent.
