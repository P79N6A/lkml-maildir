As far as I know neither LTP has changed nor the machine configuration
has changed.   This is one of the very few machines we run which uses
LVM/dm etc perhaps that is a factor.
/dev/mapper/VolGroup00-LogVol01         partition       2031608 156     -1
We do know that the LTP tests add a bunch of swap and then rip them away
again.  Its possible that something bad happens when that is occuring.
It would change the level of deparation rather dramatically for sure.
Perhaps it would make sense to try out the patch from RedHat.  Sadly its
not really reproducible reliably ... so its hard to know how we tell if
its worked.
Sigh.
