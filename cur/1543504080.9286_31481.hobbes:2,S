Err, not AIUI. The block device reads the data from the device into
bh->b_data. This is one copy, if the device doesn't do DMA.
If the request ultimately came from the page cache (as all file data reads
should / do), then bh->b_data will have been initialised to point to part of
the appropriate page in the page cache. If this was a bog-standard read() call,
the data then gets copied to user space.
So that's one or two copies, depending on whether you count reading from the
device as a copy.

It isn't necessary, if you've mmap()d it. If you've just read() it, there's
one copy to user space. IIRC there was a discussion about the whole "zero
copy" issue, I think the outcome was that this single copy to user space
was not significant performance-wise, anyway.

I'll have to look at this a bit more before I comment..
