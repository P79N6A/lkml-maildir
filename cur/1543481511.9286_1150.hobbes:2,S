Well under NT if I check the properties of a file that is 16,215,628
Bytes, it claims it is 15.4 MB ( 16215628/(1024*1024) ) = 15.464427948.
So they do use the 1024B/KB 1024KB/MB convention. The Mac has always
done it this way too. My own opinion is to stick to that but the SI and
IEEE folks never ask me ;)
cheers
