Check your hardware. ATA cables must not exceed 45 cm in length; for
Ultra DMA 4, 5 or 6 (66 MByte/s and faster), you need to use 80-wire
cables (they need extra ground lines for shielding), and check if all
plugs are seated properly.
WRT the backtrace you showed, someone else will have to answer - which
kernel version are you using? If it's a Fedora-patched kernel, report
the problem to the Fedora project. If it's an older unmodified kernel,
retry with a newer kernel (2.6.12.3) first and see if the problem is
still present.
