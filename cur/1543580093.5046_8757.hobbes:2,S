snip from dmesg:
PCI: Probing PCI hardware
PCI: Cannot allocate resource region 0 of device 00:09.0
  got res[10000000:10ffffff] for resource 0 of ATI Technologies Inc 3D
Rage I/II 215GT [Mach64 GT]
Limiting direct PCI/PCI transfers.
What does this mean?
The video card should be using irq 10 according to the BIOS on bootup.
The video card shares int 10 with other devices as well.
           CPU0

 15:         47          XT-PIC  ide1
Why is it limiting PCI/PCI transfers?
Shawn.
