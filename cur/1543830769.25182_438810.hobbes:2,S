I'm not having a problem removing the messages if the current state can be obtained
elsewhere.
Looking at the patch I see at least one problem (in more than one place) - before
accessing data, you should check that the relevant piece to be read is entirely within
range. You should not (as done at least once) rely on copy_from_user() failing - the
data may be readable, but out of bounds wrt. the information in the headers (or the
header sizes themselves).
