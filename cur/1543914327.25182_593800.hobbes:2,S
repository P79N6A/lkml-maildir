There are many regressions right now, _ONLY_ if you enable
CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND.  If you disable that, your problems will go away,
right?
This option is a new option, and we have found out the hard way that
a very large class of hardware really does not like working with usb
suspend at all.
Because of this, we have a patch queued up for 2.6.24 that will disable
suspend for devices, and have to be enabled from a white-list that we
will put in userspace based on the history of what other operating
systems have determined are devices that can sleep properly.
I can send this patch in now to Linus, but as it changes functionality
from previous -rc patches, I've been hesitant to do so.  Especially when
a mere config option change will solve your problem.
Oh, and currently no distro will enable this option due to the hardware
problems, so the only people that could get hit by this are those who
build their own kernels, and they can easily disable the option.
Does this help explain things?
thanks,
greg k-h
