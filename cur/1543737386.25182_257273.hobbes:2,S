My machine shows the same thing. Only shutdown in /sys/power/disk
Grab the code from Documentation/power/swsusp.txt (starts at line 151)
I compiled it to an executable called swsusp and I then run 'swsusp' to 
start the suspend process.
2.6.9-rc3 was my first attempt at suspend, and it worked as designed on 
the first try.
