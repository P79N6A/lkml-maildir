With this patch we can now distingush between comments and menulines
that the user cannot cahnge.
As one of the major issues with kconfig is the evil select handling
it would have been much preferred to distingush between lines
that are selected-by and lines that cannot be changed for other
reasons.
The block menu is a good example where we do not sue select. It is marked
'---' because it is default y if EMBEDDED is not selected.
So the intention is clear and your changed interface (sym_get_min_val())
look OK.
But can you take a look at distingushing between non-selectable options
due to dependency issues and seleted-by symbols.
