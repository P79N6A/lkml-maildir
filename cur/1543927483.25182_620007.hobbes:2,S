Yes, probably.

Yes, it's at least needed for the case when the wall clock is wrong.
If it's syncronized with NTP (or similiar), it's not really needed.
Anyway, if this patch is accepted, I'll be happy send patches against the 
various bootup scripts to save the last seq_number at shutdown and
restore it at bootup. Maybe something similiar as the /var/lib/random-seed
which is saved by /etc/init.d/halt in Fedora.

The big difference between random UUIDs and time-based UUIDs is that
time-based UUIDs can be used more efficiently as indexing keys in databases.
The true randomness of random UUIDs just break performance, while
with some further tricks you can get time-based UUIDs easily sorted.
At least we saw a big speed difference when we used time-based keys, as
they e.g. were used on Windows with MS SQL server. On Linux I personally 
would like to see a similiar speedup and for that really unique time-based
UUIDs are needed.

Yes, but still libuuid from e2fsprogs does a good job for what's really 
needed and sufficient for the e2fsprogs tools like mkfs.
Sadly the time-based variant of libuuid still hase some way to go.
Initially I really wanted to send patches for libuuid to fix the 
time-based variant, but now I really think the kernel-solution is 
the better, smaller, cleaner and more reliable approach.
