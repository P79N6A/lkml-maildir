Consider this problem report to be potentially "bogus" since it was
apparently isolated to OpenLinux 2.4 and does not seem to affect other
Linux versions.  The spinlocks aren't broken generally, just in the
OpenLinux 2.4 case.  
The issue raised about SPARC spinlocks was valid (after reviewing the
SPARC64 manuals at www.sun.com).    
Sorry Linus.
