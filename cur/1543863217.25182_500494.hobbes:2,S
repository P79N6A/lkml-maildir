I think that _both_ sentences are right. Reflog records history of where the
tip of each branch was at each moment, logging also what command was used
to move tip of branch (was it commit, amending commit, rebase, reset, or
creating branch anew, git-am or pull).
But where tip of each branch was is purely local matter. What is global
is DAG of commits, refs are always as seen by one particular repository.
