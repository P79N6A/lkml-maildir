You just arrange for the script to detect whether a private key is
present.  If none exists, it asks the user whether they want to generate
a private key, and then calls gpg with the relevant options to do so.
The private key isn't part of the script, nor is it a requirement to
be able to (successfully) run the script.
Note that the GPL does not say whether the output from the installation
script has to be usable with the target hardware.
