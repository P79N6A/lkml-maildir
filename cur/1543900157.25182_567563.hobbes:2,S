Exactly.  I have CC-ed everyone involved, and clearly stated that I do
want it reviewed.  There wasn't any evil intention.
I _am_ slightly pissed off by still not having this bug fixed after
two months, and after spending considerable effort at hunting it down
and finding a solution for it (actually three different solutions by
now).
This may seem low priority and irrelevant, but it _is_ a bug, and it's
affecting a real world application.  So please take that into
consideration.
Thanks,
Miklos
