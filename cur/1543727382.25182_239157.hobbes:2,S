Very interesthing.
The K8 core (aka Opteron or Athlon64) has exactly the same prefetch page
fault bugs that the K7 core has. This, coupled with your observation

really makes me wonder..
NOTE! Almost every time we've wondered about a CPU bug, it really wasn't. 
It usually ends up being something really subtle with memory ordering, 
with TLB updates, or something. So I'm putting the prefetch issue up on 
the table as just a wild theory. It would be interestign to see if we can 
get a bigger set of boxes with this crash.
Andi, I think you were the contact for the AMD prefetch bug. Can you ask 
around the same people whether there might be other problems in this area? 
No point in putting a lot of effort into it, but just as one thing to 
check for..
