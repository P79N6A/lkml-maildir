I have to disagree on this. It runs fine on most PC's, as they use standard 
devices.
Just say NO to anything proprietary. This includes Toshiba. Makers of such 
odd machines
should supply their own native drivers if they want to be supported.

How can you load modules into the kernel before root is mounted?
No harddrive accessible means no modules.

Why?

Talk to Toshiba. See if they are willing to part with "secret" information 
so that you
can create specific drivers for Linux. After that, I bet your next comp. 
won't be from them. :-)

Again, Framebuffer cannot be a module as it needs to be in place before the 
kernel even gets to init (the program).
Since the kernel cannot load modules before the drives are mounted, no 
module here.
>7: As I said mount with statistics database of files.
Just how much detail of file usage do you want?
Just open and close? Do you want reads and writes too?

In order to change the kernel, all running processes must be terminated.
How can you install a new kernel without any process to make the changeover?
