Mmmm. As we already have this:
config NUMA
        bool "Numa Memory Allocation and Scheduler Support"
        depends on SMP && HIGHMEM64G && (X86_NUMAQ || X86_GENERICARCH || (X86_SU
MMIT && ACPI))
        default n if X86_PC
        default y if (X86_NUMAQ || X86_SUMMIT)
do we really need to cascade it back out like that into everything that
selects NUMA? Perhaps we should make NUMA select SMP && HIGHMEM64G, rather
than depend on it?
