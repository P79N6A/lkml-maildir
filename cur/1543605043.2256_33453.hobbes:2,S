    But you're probably right that it doesn't really matter, and as we
    really have "pipe" semantics we might as well dis-allow any lseek
    except to the beginning (I know that there have been apps out
    there that avoid re-opening /proc files by lseek'ing to zero and
    re-reading - they may not be common enough to matter, though).
I always wondered why for a number of /proc entries that aren't really
files why we don't simply expose them as pipes as opposed to
zero-length files?  Surely that will confuse fewer user-land programs
as well and feeling more technically correct?
