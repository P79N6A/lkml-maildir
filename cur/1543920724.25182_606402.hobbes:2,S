Why not?  Why the heck do we have to keep the worst of the current mess,
when many drivers CAN (and sometimes have to) tell appart the two classes of
events?  Make notifications a separate thing from regular events, please.
The use of the same path for notifications and events are already a big
enough concession to the HAL model.  AFAIK, HAL is the only reason why on
most systems the userspace consumer of events and notification events are
the same.  HAL gets them all (as well as ACPI events, and whatever else its
helpers poll the system for), and then distributes them over to various
other paths.
On a HAL-less system, it is far less clear that anything that needs the real
events would bother with the notifications.  The only class of applications
that have an use for the notifications are OSD applets and the like.

If one adds EV_NOTIFY, one can just allow for the same KEY constants that
are valid for EV_KEY, and be done with that, I suppose.  But my take is that
Dmitry wants to limit the number of notifications going over input.
I'd rather we added an EV_NOTIFY *bit* that gets or-ed to the real EV_*
type, so that one can turn any event into a notification.  This is certainly
to be useful at least for EV_KEY and EV_SWITCH.
