Hello,
Somewhere between 2.3.42 and 2.3.47, isapnp support was added to the
soundblaster driver. But, instead of making life easier, it refuses to use
the values that were set by the userspace program isapnp, it refuses to
accept the module paramaters I provide, instead it reads the first
possible configuration from the soundblaster card and uses that. Trying to
disable it with the parameter isapnp=0 makes the modules fail loading with
the message "device or resource busy".
Met vriendelijke groet,
Guus Sliepen.
