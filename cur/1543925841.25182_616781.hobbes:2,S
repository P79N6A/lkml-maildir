I don't see a point in doing that - that would be a more manual 
bisecting, and the result would not be one guilty commit.
Testers are not expected to be able to hack a kernel, but it's 
reasonable to expect testers to be able to build their own kernels
(and your proposal wouldn't change that).
The small instruction below is enough for everyone who is able to 
build his own kernel to do a git bisect.

<--  snip  -->
# install git
# clone Linus' tree:
git clone \ 
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
# start bisecting:
cd linux-2.6
git bisect start
git bisect bad v2.6.21
git bisect good v2.6.20
cp /path/to/.config .
# start a round
make oldconfig
make
# install kernel, check whether it's good or bad, then:
git bisect [bad|good]
# start next round
After at about 10-15 reboots you'll have found the guilty commit
("...  is first bad commit").
