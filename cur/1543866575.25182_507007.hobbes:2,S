It would depend entirely on the workload / how you use your machine and the 
balance of ram size vs hard drive speed vs swap size. The simple test app I 
used attached below used on a 1GB machine with a fairly modern hard drive 
saved:
Without:
Timed portion 6272175 microseconds
With:
Timed portion 523623 microseconds
This was with 700MB of what would be considered "application data". So if you 
had lots of firefox windows open, openoffice, email client etc open and then 
did something which caused a big swap load (I have this effect when printing 
an full page colour picture at high resolution), then the total time saved 
over clicking those applications back to life after some idle time (so you 
printed and walked away while it was printing) was about 5.5 seconds. 
So the total saved time over a day would depend on how often you hit swap, and 
how often you clicked things back to life. Of course if you never hit swap 
the code does basically nothing.
Note this app is a silly little thing that only worked on 32bit if I recall 
correctly but here it is.
build with 
gcc -o mallocall mallocall.c -W -Wall -lrt
then test without swap prefetch enabled, and then enable it and test again.
