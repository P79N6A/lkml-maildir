False.  What will happen is that distros will default to extents, and 
users will continue to not read documentation, as usual.

This is different.
The proposal is to change the thing called "ext3" to suddenly require 
kernels >= 2.6.18, while still calling it "ext3."
The above examples are actually proving my point.  The above examples 
had much more clear distinctions between incompatible upgrades.

I wouldn't use the word "cautious" to describe continually adding new, 
incompatible features to the main Linux filesystem.
You are as cautious as one can be, while adding potentially 
destabilizing features.
