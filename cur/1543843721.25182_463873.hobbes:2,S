Subject: [PATCH -rc7] 3rd try: Documentation/ABI: devfs is not obsolete, but removed!
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi everybody, Greg, Linus,
This little patch just moves the devfs entry from ABI/obsolete to
ABI/removed, and adds the comment, that devfs was removed in 2.6.18.
The patch was send on 3. Sep and 9. Sep 2006 to the LKML but nobody 
picked it up, so here is another chance. :-) 
The patch is against linus' current git tree and it would be nice to 
see it in the final 2.6.18 kernel.
Please cc: me!  Kind regards, Jens
