Hi,
  I have the entire IDE subsystem in modular mode (I boot from SCSI).
However, I do have CDROM driver attached to IDE, and that driver does
not want to be found when kernel 2.3.18ac5 is used.
Somehow I have a feeling that changes done around mid august did ruin
things for people who don't have any single IDE disks, while still
have other IDE interfaced peripherals, like CDROM driver.
