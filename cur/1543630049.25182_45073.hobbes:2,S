AFAICT without testing it, you should be able to directly replace
__FILE__ with KBUILD_BASENAME.  Both are just pre-processor variables.
On my bells and whistles list (things to add after kbuild 2.5 is in the
kernel) is KBUILD_UNIQUE_NAME.  That variable will contain enough of
the pathname to uniquely identify the source.  For globally unique
names it is the same as KBUILD_BASENAME with a .[cS] suffix.  For
repeated filenames like inode.c it is fs/inode.c for the top level,
ext2/inode.c for an individual filesystem.
