Note that this also means SCSI_WAIT_SCAN=n (will not get compiled
and built even as a module) if SCSI=y. But this is perfectly fine, because
I see:
#ifndef MODULE
late_initcall(scsi_complete_async_scans);
#endif
in drivers/scsi/scsi_scan.c anyway, so the async scans will be waited
upon and get complete even when SCSI=y and scsi_scan_type=async,
i.e. you don't really need the scsi_wait_scan module in that case anyway.
