SLUB can easily be made to not use higher order pages.
If the SLUB mobility patches are not merged then higher order page use 
can be explicitly enabled via passing the following to the kernel on boot
	slub_max_order=<desired max order>
If they are merged then the higher order page use can be disabled in case 
of trouble via
	slub_max_order=0
