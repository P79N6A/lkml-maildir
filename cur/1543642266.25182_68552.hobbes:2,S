That's up to you. Since the bswap or roll are only in the conditional,
hopefully infrequently used paths of an odd buffer address, I don't
believe that selecting one or the other has any measurable impact.

Now that is grossly inefficient ;-) since you can save one instruction by
moving roll after adcl (hand edited partial patch hunk, won't apply):
+25:
+	testl $1, %esi
+	jz 30f
+	# buf is odd
+	dec %ecx
+	jl 90f
+	movzbl (%esi), %ebx
+	addl %ebx, %eax
+	adcl $0, %eax
+	inc %esi
+	roll $8, %eax
+	testl $2, %esi
+	jz 10b
