Patch applied, thanks much.
I notice you removed the following code, rather than fixing it.  It is
OK to remove this code??
-       //add by clearzhang 2004/7/8
-       pci_read_config_dword(pdev,0x0,&configval);
-       m526x_id = configval;
-       if(configval == 0x526310b9)
-       {
-               //printk("is m5263\n");
-               pci_read_config_dword(pdev,0x0c,&configval);
-               configval = ((configval & 0xffff00ff) | 0x8000);
-               pci_write_config_dword(pdev,0x0c,configval);
-       }
Thanks,
