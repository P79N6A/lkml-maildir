Okay, so pay the licence or not use IDEA. If I happen to want to use
IDEA for encrypting my /dev/loop on my home box, why not (I don't, I use
Blowfish)? IIRC, you can implement IDEA any way you like, as long as you
pay if you use it in a way Eric explained. All I'm saying is that there
are legitimate uses for IDEA that do not require you to pay and it is no
problem to make an GPLed implementation part of the kernel (please
correct me if I'm wrong).
Apart from the pros and cons of particular ciphers: Do we share the
opinion that the kernel Crypto-API should not be limited to a single
cipher (e.g. AES)?
