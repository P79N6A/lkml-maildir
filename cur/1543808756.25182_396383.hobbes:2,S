 - another acpi
>  regression.  We have the actual offending commit here.
per my note in the bug report, I believe that this failure
is not related to the "offending commit", and thus that commit
should not be reverted.  I believe that this failure is because
the system is booted with "pci=noacpi" in IOAPIC mode --
and unsuportable configuration -- and will endeavor to confirm...
thanks,
