I'm not sure what was discussed in VM summit. If I miss the point, sorry.
I think the important thing here is the amount of free pages we try to keep.
Remaining unused pages as page cache(and not free them) may help performance if lucky
but increases uncertainity.
Now, enlarging min_free_kbytes or mempool is useful to avoid page allocation failure 
in device drivers, which does write-back of dirty pages.
I think controlling free memory itself is better than controlling *used* inactive clean
pages.
