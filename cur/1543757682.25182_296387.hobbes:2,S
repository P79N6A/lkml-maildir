Think of the overhead required to track every single resource ever 
aquired by the process/thread/entity in question.  Then if/when it 
hangs, you'd have to properly clean up every last one of them.
Much safer/simpler to leave it hung, and force an eventual reboot.
If you have been given code that causes D states, bitch to the supplier 
until they fix it.  Kernel bugs are not acceptable.
