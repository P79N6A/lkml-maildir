This is solved by using ioctl_by_bdev() in your suggestion. Thanks.

PC98 BIOS create geometry table on boottime orderd by SCSI ID.
We read that to get geometry. If ide-scsi exist we mis-read table.

(Snipped, but I'll fix them. Thanks.)

We need BIOS geometry exactly to create a partion on linux (by fdisk or
GNU/parted). BIOS uses C/H/S access on boottime according to partition
table. If BIOS geometry is not exact, fail to boot from the partition.
I recived the report about this problem from people using advansys driver
without PC98 patch.

Yes, of course.
