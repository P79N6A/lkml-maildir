  Then it is good. Just I see no programs other than Gnome or KDE apps
  that are using them.

  No only, but if you cp then with a non KDE/Gnome app then you will
  loose the meta-data and extra info too. That was my point.

  This is certainly not what I said or wanted.

  Do you really believe this will happen? Good if it did. I do not
  believe it. And I certainly do not see the thousands of man hours
  needed to actually provide all the patches as a benefit.
