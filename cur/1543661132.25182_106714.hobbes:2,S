Actually the Soundblaster idea might not be so funny as it originally
sounds, (pun intended :-) ), because if you've got another machine
nearby, with a microphone, you could actually turn up the volume, and
de-code the morse on the other box.  The PC speaker may well be too
quiet to do that.  It should be fairly straightforward to get a simple
bleep out of any card that implements the Adlib registers.
