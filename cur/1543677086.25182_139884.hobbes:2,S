I have been debugging long and hard a thing where IO is done
with O_DIRECT flag applied to open(2).
Unlike Linux, FreeBSD (where this flag originates, apparently) does
_not_ require that read()/write() happens from page aligned memory
areas, and/or be of page-size multiples in size.
This needs at least wording in  open(2) man-page, possibly code
changes in the kernel to support alike behaviour.
