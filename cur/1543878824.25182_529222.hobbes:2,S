Yes, something Oleg said made me realize that.
As long as the reparent isn't to complex it isn't required that we
have exactly one list .

I think my head is finally on straight about this question.
Currently there is the silly linux specific parent death signal
(pdeath_signal).  Oleg's memory was a better than mine on this score.
However there is no indication that the parent death signal being sent
when a thread leader dies is actually correct, or even interesting.
It probably should only be sent when getppid changes.
So with pdeath_signal fixed that is nothing that requires us to
reparent within the same thread group.
I'm trying to remember what the story is now.  There is a nasty
race somewhere with reparenting, a threaded parent setting SIGCHLD to
SIGIGN, and non-default signals that results in an zombie that no one
can wait for and reap.  It requires being reparented twice to trigger.
Anyway it is a real mess and if we can remove the stupid multi-headed
child lists things would become much simpler and the problem could
not occur.
Plus the code would become much simpler...
utrace appears to have removed the ptrace_children list and the
special cases that entailed.
