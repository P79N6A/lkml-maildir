You can easily change this by reducing the number of inodes created.
If you specify "mke2fs -N 1 <dev>" you will get the minimum possible
number of inodes created.  There is currently a 16TB limit on ext2/3
filesystems, unless you are testing on a platform with 8kB+ PAGE_SIZE
and have the e2fsprogs from the BK repository, in which case you can
create 8kB blocks (for 32TB filesystems).
Cheers, Andreas
