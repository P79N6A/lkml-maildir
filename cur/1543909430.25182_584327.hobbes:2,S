if you're using a current enough kernel, no big deal. If you use an old
one and it bounces, then you go look further. The biggest deal for this
feature is to find out mechanically whom to CC patches to; if you're
doing patches, you better use a recent enough kernel annyway. 
(and if you're doing patches against something ancient, you more than
likely have a modern tree somewhere for lookaside)
