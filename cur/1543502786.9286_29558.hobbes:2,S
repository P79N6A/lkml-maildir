I know.. but there's no harm in chucking the idea into the air and seeing what
people think, is there?

Source-level compatibility is really what I was worrying about, but binary
compatibility would be nice too. I don't approve of (and wouldn't run) binary
ONLY drivers, but it would be nice not to have to rebuild pcmcia-cs each time
I patch the kernel on my laptop. 
I notice that CONFIG_MODVERSIONS seems to have been fixed in 2.3.x -- but I
haven't tried it. I do notice that modutils 2.1.121 requires -f to load a
module even if module versioning is turned on -- that's a bit unnecessary,
isn't it?
