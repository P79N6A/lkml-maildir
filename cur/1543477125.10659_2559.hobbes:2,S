Numbers of different recipients per top-domain in all of VGER's lists are
listed here (top-10 in count), along with associated fanout relay:
  ....
    633 ca              vger.rutgers.edu
    660 se              ifi.uio.no
    689 it              nic.funet.fi
    911 au              samba.anu.edu.au
   1176 org             listserv.funet.fi
   1226 uk              ferret.lmh.ox.ac.uk
   2634 de              ferret.lmh.ox.ac.uk
   2700 edu             entropy.muc.muohio.edu
   4475 net             listserv.funet.fi
   8119 com             listserv.funet.fi
We *tried* to run ORG, COM, and NET thru US located systems, but
when those relays failed, we moved the traffic back to FUNET...
  By all means you are welcome to offer fanout relay service, but
are you prepared for the load ?
Mind you, VGER is delivering about 1.5 MILLION recipients per 24 hours
through the fanouts, and some small (mostly US-based) top-levels by
itself.   The disk where all this is happening is not hottest possible
(or perhaps it literally is that, but not fastest)..

  At least to separate spindles.. (disks, that is)
