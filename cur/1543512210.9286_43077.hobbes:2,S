Although I was wrong, I get the feeling Richard did/does it this
way because the VFS isn't suited to what he wanted and would add
a layer to node creation, as apposed to simply having implicit
files, so-to-speak.

And I think they're bullshit, and they're NOT reasons
to exclude the devfs, they are only reasons for you
to not use it.

Well, except that you have to create some different class of special
file or still raise the dev_t bar a little, and that's not permenent.
