Side note ... if there's a sleepable context in which oprofile can
synchronise its buffers (i.e. after the task can possible run on a CPU
again, and before the task_struct itself is freed/reused), that would be
very handy.
Currently we're masking out any samples when PF_EXITING is set for
current(), which is obviously less than ideal.
Would this be such a spot ? Basically somewhere that profile_exit_task
can sit.
