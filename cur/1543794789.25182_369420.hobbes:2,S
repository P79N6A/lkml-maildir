Some people suggested we don't know usage and organization patterns yet,
perhaps something that is very sparse can benefit from linear addressing
in a huge (not to say vastly oversized) address space. Perhaps not.
One real-world example is that we've been doing RAM overcommit for a
long time to account for but not actually perform memory allocations,
and on 32-bit machines, 1 GB of RAM already required highmem until
recently. So here, 64-bit address space comes as an advantage.
