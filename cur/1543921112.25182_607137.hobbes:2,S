Similar opinion here but sometimes driver versions are useful, i.e.:
* during development or while debugging regressions to distinguish
  real changes (which have to update driver version) from the core
  changes and trivial cleanups (which don't do this)
* bugreports with partial dmesg info (hmm, doesn't matter for IDE
  currently since we don't print this info - patches are welcomed)
* maybe some other that I forgot :)
I updated siimage driver version in separate commit
(no need to do it for cs5535 since it lacks driver version).
Thanks,
Bart
