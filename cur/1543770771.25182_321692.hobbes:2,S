Basically diff should work for some of subdirectories in alsa-kernel.
Although we've tried to sync the files in sound/ directory with
mainline, better not to diff them.
As an example, I've checked the kernel sync between ALSA and mainline
trees with the script.  Note that sound_core.c etc in sound/ are not
checked.  ~/alsa-kernel-excludes contains the files to ignore like .*,
*.o, CVS, etc.

Yes.  The alsa-kernel tree is for Linus tree, in principle.

The released alsa-drivers are for the latest Linus tree.
The patches to stable tree are taken occasionally, so they are not
collected...

I understand it - Although git works great, I won't use it with the
analog modem connection at home :)
