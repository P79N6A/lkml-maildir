Ok, that's almost expected behavior. 
I cannot explain why the LCD stays on, besides the fact that something on 
the ACPI side of things is not working correctly. Though, it appears to be 
performing the entire suspend/resume cycle.
Drivers are still an issue. The current work around is to try removing all 
modules before suspending. There is also an issue with reinitializing the 
ACPI IRQ routing links, which will be addressed shortly.

Sorry, I missed that line in the logs before. You need HIGHMEM enabled to 
support the full 1GB of RAM, but the suspend-to-disk code is not prepared 
to handle high pages yet. It will be addressed, but probably not for 
another few weeks. 
Thanks,
