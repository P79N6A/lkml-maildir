Maybe one day local non-volitile storage won't even matter.
For example, say you were setting up a, (partial), mirror of kernel.org.
If you already had several machines in a datacentre, you could install
another one with no disks at all, just 4 GB of RAM, and configure it
to boot over the lan, loading the root filesystem in to a ramdisk.
Once booted, it could retrieve the parts of kernel.org that you wanted
to serve from a trusted mirror site, and begin serving.
Other such machines could use your machine as a trusted mirror site,
and eventually you could have lots of these machines all holding their
partial mirror of kernel.org in RAM.
As long as there is at least one on-line, any others can go down and
come up, and it doesn\'t really matter - they will just re-sync with
another node.
Of course, this would use up a lot of network bandwidth, but in the
future that may not matter.
Or, a more practical usage would be a load balanced cluster of
webservers - why bother with non-volitile storage in all of them?
Some of them could serve entirely from RAM, having booted over the
LAN.
John.
