Right, I saw that, didn't know that you'd merged it yet.  Ho hum, yet
another reject to fix up.
I think your patch is a bit minimal: at adds blk_congestion_end() whereas
it'd make better sense longer-term to remove blk_congestion_wait() and
blk_congestion_end() altogether, replace them with something which is
somewhere else and which doesn't mention "blk".  I expected this to be done
four years ago ;)
But not now.  Nobody's allowed to touch anything else!
