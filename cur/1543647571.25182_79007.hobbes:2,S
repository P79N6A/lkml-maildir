Subversion is a CVS replacement already.

Pavel, I know you want to kill bitkeeper.  However, whining
isn't going to achieve that. Turning subversion into a better
tool than bitkeeper might...
I think Ben Collins already has a script to extract changesets
from the kernel tree using just CSSC as a tool. Why don't you
help him get those changesets imported into Subversion ?

Rik
