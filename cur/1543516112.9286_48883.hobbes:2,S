The Mandrake 6.0 supplied pgcc is well known for it's mis-compiling of
the kernel sources. I have received several bug reports on my AceNIC
Gigabit Ethernet driver so far which showed up to be because it was
compiled with that compiler. When the users compiled the exact same
version of the source with a proper compiler (like the one supplied in
Red Hat 6) it worked just fine.
