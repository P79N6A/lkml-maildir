I did figure out that's what it's currently used as, but I didn't want
to introduce a whole new call just to verify that the UART has 9bit
capability.
Why aren't user changes validated?

9bit mode is much more than just words of 9 bit length. Parity is
gone, replaced by the 9th bit; reads and writes have to treat the
buffers driver-side buffers as 16 bit-wide instead of 8-bit; reads and
writes to the hardware are correspondingly different; there are new
interrupts; software flow control is gone; there's special address
matching and a new ioctl to set that up.
It seemed easier to create a new mode of operation based on the
UPF_9BIT flag; using the CS9 flag doesn't imply any of the above
except for 9 bit length.
However, I'm open to having my mind changed.
