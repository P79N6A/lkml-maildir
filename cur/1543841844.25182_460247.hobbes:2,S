Except optionally for the following for chips not handled by or broken
totally in drivers/ide:
	pata_mpiix - some early pentium era laptops
	pata_oldpiix - original "PIIX" chipset
	pata_radisys - embedded chipset
The other apparently "libata only" chips are pata_jmicron and
pata_optidma. There are patches to handle these as "generic" PCI IDE in
the base 2.6.18 tree already so only features will be lost (eg mode
switching). As Jeff implies distributions should be using drivers/ide
for the Jmicron PATA and the Opti DMA PATA for now.

Add "/dev/sr*" does not support partitions. (That needs fixing anyway)

libata needs changes for this too. I have some stuff saved from the
older discussions to look at.

and thats without using fingers or thumbs.
