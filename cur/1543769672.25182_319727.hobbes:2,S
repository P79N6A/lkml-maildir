I added these lines to my makefile:
always := syscall
syscall:
         @echo ${SYSCALL_METHOD}
and I got this error:
make[3]: *** No rule to make target 
`/root/AMSO1100/software/host/linux/sys/devccil/syscall', needed by `__build'.  Stop.
I need to specify a target that is NOT a file.  How can I tell kbuild that my target isn't 
a file, but just a rule that needs to be run?
