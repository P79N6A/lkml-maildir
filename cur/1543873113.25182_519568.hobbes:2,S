I tried a make -j5 on my Dual processor PIII Xeon box.  It was pretty
slow.  Firefox was ok scrolling with keyboard, but the scrollbar was
jerky.  I also has MP3s playing at the same time and it worked just
fine.  No drops that I heard. 
This is 2.6.21-rc3 patched with RSDL.  
To me, that large a load on my system was just pushing it too hard.
Esp since firefox seems to have become a total CPU hog in it's own
right lately.  Or is that because I have a Matrox G450 as my video
card and it's not handling GPU rendering in the card, but in the OS
these days?  I dunno...
I guess I need to reboot into the default scheduler and see how it
goes.  
Serge> Please reconsider your statement.
This is not a nice statement on your half.  Mike has been doing a
great job testing.  He and Con don't seem to communicate well at
times, but hey, they're still talking and working together, even with
friction.  I'm happy to see all this testing going on!
