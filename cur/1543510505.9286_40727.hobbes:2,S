One classic example for how you'd use ACLs is the Surprise Birthday
Party Announcement, for which you want to grant everyone in a group
read access except the guest of honor. There, does that help you
feel better? Maybe they've gotten you a nice cake!
When we evaluated Irix (at B1) we had to address the issues of
access control policy, including why it was that a user might be
able to see the permission bit on a file that she couldn't read.
We explained it thus:
Access to a file system object (e.g. a file) is controlled by
a set of policies:
	PATH-DATA-READ
		The path leading to the object must be composed
		of readable objects.
		The MAC label of the subject (e.g. process) must
		dominate that of the object.
		The DAC permissions (e.g. permission bits, ACL)
		on the object must allow read.
	PATH-DATA-WRITE
		The path leading to the object must be composed
		of readable objects.
		The MAC label of the subject (e.g. process) must
		dominate that of the object.
		The DAC permissions (e.g. permission bits, ACL)
		on the object must allow write.
	PATH-ATTRIBUTE-READ
		The path leading to the object must be composed
		of readable objects.
		The MAC label of the subject (e.g. process) must
		dominate that of the object.
	PATH-ATTRIBUTE-WRITE
		The path leading to the object must be composed
		of readable objects.
		The MAC label of the subject (e.g. process) must
		dominate that of the object.
		The owner of the subject must be the owner of the
		object.
	FD-DATA-READ
		Access is permitted.
	FD-DATA-WRITE
		Access is permitted to the extent granted on open().
	FD-ATTRIBUTE-READ
		Access is permitted.
	FD-ATTRIBUTE-WRITE
		The owner of the subject must be the owner of the
		object.
The access to the attributes of a file are controlled differently
from the access to the data of a file. Short of using an additional
scheme such as MAC, there is no way to prevent someone from reading
the attributes for a file without using the attributes of another
object (a containing directory).
You could decide that an ACL is a "special attribute", with yet
another access control policy. I'd be interested in a policy that
makes sense. If you say check the ACL, I'll refer you to MAC.
