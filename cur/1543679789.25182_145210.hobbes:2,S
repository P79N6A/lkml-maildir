I guess what I'm saying is, the problem is far from solved, however your 
concrete results demonstrate you've got an intuitive grasp of how to go at 
it.  I'd like to dig in and find out what the deep issues are.  As I've 
basically ignored scheduling up to now, including all of the details of 
Ingo's work, there's some background to fill in.  Being lazy, I'd prefer to 
read somebody's detailed [rfc] instead of going through the process of 
reverse engineering it myself.  I presume I'm not the only one.
Regards,
Daniel
