I did, it was that ppp->tty_pushing was tested in one statement and set in
another a bit further down.  The way it used to be done handled the
concurrency between mainline and bottom halves (without blocking either)
but wasn't good enough for SMP.
Now it uses test_and_set_bit instead to make it atomic.

Well, yes, that's what I thought too, that's why I used it.
