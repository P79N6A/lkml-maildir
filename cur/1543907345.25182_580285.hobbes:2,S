If it were done that way (by asking OS driver to deliver commands TFs),
I wouldn't have any problem at all.  The spin down command is issued
from deep down in the acpi power off method - entering S5 directly
issues ATA commands bypassing the whole OS except for the ACPI
interpreter.  It's just like the toshiba suspend crap and there's no
standard way to tell whether the acpi power off method is gonna do it or
not.  We'll just have to blacklist it.
Thanks.
