Its my turn now for the professional statements, let's start with this
technical side: you wanted to send a signal for the process to be killed,
but this will need
1. to allocate a signal, which will deadlock
2. no need to do this for sigill, but it will not work if process is in
unkillable state, while oom-killer clears iirc
Now to the oom-handler: if it will want to free some memory, it will
have to call a syscall with some pointer, which in turn may be in the
swapped area, so handler will be locked.
