Under 2.4.21:
For my boot drive, ide:
/dev/hdc2:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 IO_support   =  1 (32-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    =  8 (on)
 geometry     = 2100/255/63, sectors = 32740470, start = 996030
For the scsi drives(2 drives in a raid 1 setup):
/dev/sda:
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 geometry     = 17885/255/63, sectors = 287332384, start = 0
And some performance numbers, maybe these are helpful:
/dev/md1:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.60 seconds =213.33 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  2.22 seconds = 28.83 MB/sec
/dev/hdc:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.56 seconds =228.57 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  4.33 seconds = 14.78 MB/sec
Under 2.5.75:
/dev/hdc:
 multcount    = 16 (on)
 IO_support   =  1 (32-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
 using_dma    =  1 (on)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    = 256 (on)
 geometry     = 33483/16/63, sectors = 33750864, start = 0
These are with X running:
/dev/hdc:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in 30.58 seconds =  4.19 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 20.98 seconds =  3.05 MB/sec
Hmm.. suspicious results: probably not enough free memory for a proper test.
/dev/md1:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in 108.76 seconds =  1.18 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 44.86 seconds =  1.43 MB/sec
Hmm.. suspicious results: probably not enough free memory for a proper test.
With X shutdown:
/dev/hdc:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in 11.26 seconds = 11.36 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  6.88 seconds =  9.30 MB/sec
Hmm.. suspicious results: probably not enough free memory for a proper test.
/dev/md1:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in 11.88 seconds = 10.77 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  7.74 seconds =  8.27 MB/sec
Hmm.. suspicious results: probably not enough free memory for a proper test.
I'm running xf4.2.1 and the 'nv' driver.
Any ideas as to what else I can look at?
Thanks,
Chris
