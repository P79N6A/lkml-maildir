Subject: [PATCH 0/9] extents and 48bit blk changes for ext4 filesystem
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/9/436

As we have forked the ext4 filesystem and JBD2, this is an update the
previously known as 48bit ext3 patches
changes since last time:
-rebase all previous ext3 patches to against ext4/jbd2
-fixed an reservation window intialization issue with extent block
allocation
and merge the change to the parent patch:ext4-extents.patch
-merged prevous bug fixes patches from sct for 64 jbd2 to their parent
patch:64bit-jbd2-core.patch
-merged ext3-extents-fsblk_t patch to ext4-extents-48bit.patch
-merged 
64bit-incompat-flag-change.patch
ext3-sb-struc-sync-with-e2fsprog.patch
to parent patch 
64bit-metadata.patch
A complete series of patches (including forking ext4 filesystem patches
and 48bit patches submitted here) could be found at:
http://ext2.sourceforge.net/48bitext3/patches/latest/
To test the new ext3dev filesystem, just mount the filesystem with -t
ext3dev. By default ext3dev is still running 32 bit mode and without
extents. To testing extents and 48bit block number, need -o extent mount
option. (Maybe we should enable extent as default for ext3dev
filesystem ?)
Tested these patches on i386 and passed a few hours fsx test.
Thanks,
Mingming
