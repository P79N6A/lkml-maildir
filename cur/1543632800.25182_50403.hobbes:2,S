Al Viro actually came up with a beautiful mechanism for it: present 
the filesystem's metadata as a filesystem itself.  Blocks within a 
particular inode can then be viewed with cat, and suggested replacements 
can be made via echo.  Such a best could be called ext2metafs and work 
cooperatively with the existing filesystem code.  It's quite an elegant 
design that has utility beyond the simple case of defragmenting.

Heh, that would be excellent.
