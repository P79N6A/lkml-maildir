First, only root can disable interrupts in user-mode and read/write
to ports. One must prepare for this with iopl(3).
Second, the RTC is a shared resource. It must be protected with
a lock.
If you want to make your own rtc driver, then feel free. However,
you can't just poke at the ports from user-mode and get away with
it for any period of time. You will find that the CMOS checksum
gets screwed up and/or the time gets changed to a previous epoch.
This is because the kernel may change the index register in between
the time that you set it and when you wrote to the data register.
You need to use the provided spin-lock, rtc_lock. This needs
to be accessed from within the kernel, in your driver.
