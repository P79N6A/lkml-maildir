I manage the reference by using a list.
If you write something to "remove", 
firstly the port entry is removed from sysfs and then
the reference is removed from the list and a resource of the port is freed.

You are right.
When I tested above program, my machine crashed.
I'm going to rethink the interface for netconsole.
Thanks for your comments.
