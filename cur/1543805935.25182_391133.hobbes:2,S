Yes, but if the kernel doesn't support the user's wireless chipset and all 
they can get is binary blob drivers for their graphics cards, the rest of the 
system will seem naturally worse.

This problem exists, but even ATI and NVIDIA both recognize that there is a 
market for linux users. So they provide (some) level of effort to write 
drivers. It's probably their concerns about IP and the IP climate that keep 
their drivers closed.

I don't see how cross-platform development makes Linux attractive to 
"ordinary" (non-developer) users. I don't think asking everyone to swallow 
some red pill is going to make anything any bit better.
Cross platform toolkits like GTK and Qt already exist. Last I heard, Trolltech 
even had some large customers (Adobe, etc), so who knows - maybe Photoshop on 
X isn't so long off?

The limitations kernel developers currently face is in the availability of 
documentation and the cooperation of manufacturers. While the rise of Linux 
adoption will help this, it's up to the desktop people (read: desktop 
architects) to worry about desktop stuff. I'm a subscriber there too, and I 
realize you didn't feel all that at home with your guidelines, but don't you 
think LKML is the wrong place to be airing them?
I read Greg's words on OSDL too, and it seems (from where I stand, anyways) 
that things are going well in that area. But that initiative is focused on 
the kernel and kernel developers, and yours is focused on desktop.
