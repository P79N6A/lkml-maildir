I'm afraid you are wrong despite your desperate attempts to reinterpret
your own comments. The civil law is "balance of probability". Those are
the precise words used. As it is a dispute between two civil parties with
no assumed right or wrong it is a matter of which interpretation is most
likely "proof" doesn't come into it whatever version of proof you want to
pick this email.
"burden of proof" is a specific term with a specific meaning in law.
