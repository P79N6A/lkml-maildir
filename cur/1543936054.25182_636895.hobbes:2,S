RESERVED is usually memory used by the BIOS. Properly MMIO areas
should be in holes.
Of course there might be buggy BIOS who violate that but the
only way to find out is to check for the case in ioremap and warn. I would
be still optimistic of it being correct.
Another way would be to double check against the MTRRs - if it's UC then
it should be unmapped. Maybe that would be a good idea. That should
catch all true mmio holes unless a BIOS maps them cached but if it does
that it's already beyond help.

Exactly it's already broken.
Anyways if someone accesses mmio through /dev/mem I think they definitely
want the real mappings, not a zero page.  And dev/mem should provide.
The trick is just to do it without caching attribute violations, 
but with mattr it is possible.

reserved shouldn't be unmapped, just holes. Do they have holes
there or reserved areas?
I still hope 2MB alignment will work out.
