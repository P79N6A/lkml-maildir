Are you referring to fcntl locks?  If so what are the symptoms of not
being able to get a lock?  As far as I am aware, there should be no limit
on the number of locks per file (except memory, of course).  There is a
per process limit on the number of file locks, but it is infinite by default.
The file system can place restrictions on file locking, but I am
pretty sure that reiserfs does not.
