I meant, "directory entry pointer" is position of the directory entry
in the _partition_. like the following,
in fs/fat/misc.c:fat__get_entry()
		offset &= sb->s_blocksize - 1;
		*de = (struct msdos_dir_entry *) ((*bh)->b_data + offset);
		*ino = (sector << sbi->dir_per_block_bits) + (offset >> MSDOS_DIR_BITS);
                 ^^^
This is used for _updates_ (not create) of the directory entry. And
there is a possibility of cause of the problem which you said.  If my
guess is right and a partition will be splited small, a problem will
not occur.
In short, I think it's the bug of fat driver and it's needed the fix.
