I want to understand _why_ it is not valid.  Can you explain please?
From what you said earlier, I got the impression that calling _add() after 
_del() is illegal because it runs the risk that the refcount may be 0 and 
the object may be gone.  But if you have a separate valid reference, that 
can't happen.  Would it be legal then, or is there more to it?
