Subject: [PATCH 02/16] cancel_delayed_work: use del_timer() instead of del_timer_sync() [try #3]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/25/120

del_timer_sync() buys nothing for cancel_delayed_work(), but it is less
efficient since it locks the timer unconditionally, and may wait for the
completion of the delayed_work_timer_fn().
cancel_delayed_work() == 0 means:
	before this patch:
		work->func may still be running or queued
	after this patch:
		work->func may still be running or queued, or
		delayed_work_timer_fn->__queue_work() in progress.
		The latter doesn't differ from the caller's POV,
		delayed_work_timer_fn() is called with _PENDING
		bit set.
cancel_delayed_work() == 1 with this patch adds a new possibility:
	delayed_work->work was cancelled, but delayed_work_timer_fn
	is still running (this is only possible for the re-arming
	works on single-threaded workqueue).
	In this case the timer was re-started by work->func(), nobody
	else can do this. This in turn means that delayed_work_timer_fn
	has already passed __queue_work() (and wont't touch delayed_work)
	because nobody else can queue delayed_work->work.
