Adrian's right, and in fact from ...
http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Attributes.html
... we know why that macro existed and evaluated to __volatile__
for pre-2.5 gcc. Perhaps most of today's users of NORET_TYPE were
probably looking for ATTRIB_NORET (which is quite common) actually.
[ __noreturn is defined in compiler-gcc.h, so the easier way would be
to kill NORET_TYPE and replace its usages with ATTRIB_NORET instead.
Of course, after verifying that the function _really_ never returns. ]
