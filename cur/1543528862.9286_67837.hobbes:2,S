	This was fixed.  If you are using the latest smbmount (it has
mount compatible options like "-o user=foo", etc, etc) it SHOULD not
be having these problems.

	Patch against what version?  If there is something remaining in
the smbmount code that Tridge or I missed, by all means send me the patch
and I'll make sure it gets into the samba CVS.
