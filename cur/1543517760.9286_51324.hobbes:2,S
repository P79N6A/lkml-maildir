Hi,
I encounter some trouble in memory management.
I have the following Macro definition
#define user_vat_2_phys(VA, proc)                                      \
((void *) (pte_page(                                                   \
                                        *pte_offset(
               \
                                                                pmd_offset(
                         \
pgd_offset (proc->mm, (unsigned long)VA  ),        \
(unsigned long)VA                        \
                                ),                                \
                    (unsinged long)VA                             \
                                                              )
                         \
               ) | (((unsigned long)VA) & (~PAGE_MASK))))
'VA' is a virtual address in user space.
In my device driver,  I want to directly access the same memory specified by
'VA', so I run the following a piece of code:
phy_addr = user_va_2_phys(   (((unsigned long) VA) & PAGE_MASK),  current);
krnl_addr = phys_to_virt ((unsigned long) phy_addr);
krnl_va =  krnl_add  + ( (unsigned long)VA & ~PAGE_MAKE));
I guess, the value of krnl_va may point to the same memory as 'VA' points to.
In fact, the above code does work in Linux 2.2.5. However It does NOT work in
Linux 2.3.28. Why?
