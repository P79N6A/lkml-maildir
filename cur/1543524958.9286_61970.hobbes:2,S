Agreed.

very nice !
Do you have an estimated date when first results will be available ?

Yes, the only thing to keep in mind is that we don't want do sacrifice too much
performance while in favor of latency.
I would accept a small overall performance decrease in exchange of good 
responsiveness, but full preemtion would be overkill and would cause a big
performance hit.

I think most of us will be happy with 500-1ms max scheduling latency
when running SCHED_FIFO tasks.
Especially multimedia folks because this will enable linux to solve a wide range
of real-time multimedia problems like audio and video.
(RT audio being more critical than video since you can hear every little
deadline miss and using more than 5-20ms buffers will kill the responsiveness
completely.
