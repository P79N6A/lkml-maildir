Thanks for this. Compiling the IDE stuff as a module is indeed the easy 
part, though I suppose I need to make sure I get the right drivers for 
my chipset, too. Loading e.g. the Fedora 6 LiveCD and then lsmod'ing 
should do it, though. Labels are used by default in Fedora now, so 
that's fine, too. Getting mkinitrd to work right shouldn't be too bad, 
either. So I'll have a go at this when I get some time and report on it. 
What might be REALLY helpful to people would be if we Fedora types could 
produce a modified kernel rpm that would handle this....though, I should 
say, I've also seen a lot of complaints along these same lines on Ubuntu.
