Too many hard-code . :-( 
I'm working on a generic hotkey driver, which will move configurable 
stuff to user space. 
 Basically, I will standardize hotkey event num dispatched to user space
through /proc/acpi/event.  And I will define config and action
interfaces
under /proc/acpi/hotkey to make the hotkey driver has unified interface 
to user space daemon. :
ev_config: config interface for event based hotkey.
Format for config event based hotkey:
echo
"config_command:bus_handle:action_handle:internal_event_num:external_hot
key_num" > ev_config
For example:
1. add a new hotkey:
 echo "0 : _SB.VGA : _SB.VGA.LCD._BCM :0x86 : 0x86" >
/proc/acpi/ev_config
2. delete a hotkey config:
 echo "1: : : :0x86" > /proc/acpi/ev_config
3. update a hotkey config:
 echo "0 : _SB.VGA : _SB.VGA.CRT._BCM :0x87 : 0x87" >
/proc/acpi/ev_config
pl_config: config interface for polling based hotkey.
Format for config polling based hotkey:
 echo
"config_command:pollin_handle:action_handle:internal_event_num:external_
hotkey_num" > ev_config
For example:
1. add a new hotkey:
 echo "0 : _SB.VGA : _SB.POLLING_METHOD : _SB.ACTION_METHOD  : 0X86 :
0X86" > /proc/acpi/pl_config
2.. 
Action: action interface for acpid to call aml method related to the
hotkey event. 
Format for calling aml method through action interface.
 echo "event_num: argument type : value"
For example:
 echo "0x86:1:30" > /proc/acpi/action
Thanks,
Luming
