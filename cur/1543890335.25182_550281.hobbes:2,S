Sure, but this is core code, which is used by _all_ drivers and _all_
devices. Subsystems can decide to panic if this appropriate, but generic
core code should probably not make such decisions.
With this change, a single failing symlink (or attribute) for a
scsi/ide/block/... device may crash the whole box during bootup. I'm not
sure that this is what we want.
It's a failure that should be logged (the patch doesn't even add that),
but there is probably no reason to refuse the creation of a device, if
something non-vital like a symlink or attribute fails to be created.
Thanks,
Kay
