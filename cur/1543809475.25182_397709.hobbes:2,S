Ah.  I'm used to projects doing that through ethernet instead, in various 
hand-rolled implementations.  A generic solution for staying in sync through 
the network would be nice.
A potentially interesting project might be hooking into the journaling stuff 
to update a network block device as data gets flushed out of the journal.  
It'd need some kind of heartbeat mechanism (if the network block device 
doesn't confirm receipt of the data within X seconds, don't hold up flushing 
the journal to the filesystem and moving on with life).  And some mechanism 
to get back in sync after getting out of sync, which could be done a number 
of ways.
I wonder if there's already something like this?  (Probably...)

Never bet against the cheap plastic solution.
