If properly modularized, you'll have multiple files with such exports.
Or perhaps you won't have such exports at all, if it is hidden inside a 
module-specific struct-of-hooks.

It depends on the situation.
The hardware capabilities exported by each platform[or device] vary 
greatly, not only in the raw capabilities provided, but also in the 
level of offload.
In general, we don't want to see hardware-specific stuff in generic 
code, though...

It would be quite interesting to see where the synergies are between the 
two, at the very least.  "async [transform|sum]" is a superset of "async 
crypto" after all.
