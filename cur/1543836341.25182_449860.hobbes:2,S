Almost nothing from any other architecture makes sense for x86.  X86 is 
not a virtualizable architecture.  It has both classical problems - 
sensitive instructions, and also non-reversible CPU state.  Hardware 
virtualization is now making that easier, but simplifying the OS to 
avoid these problems is actually simpler and more efficient.  PPC64 and 
S390 had the benefit of being designed with virtualization in mind, and 
they still have "paravirtualized" kernel architectures when you look at 
the lower layers.
