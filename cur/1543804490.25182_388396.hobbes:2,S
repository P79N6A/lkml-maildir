for starters you should probably change build_zonelists so that the DMA 
zone is
not included in any of the zone lists except the DMA.  This will prevent 
__alloc_pages()
from exhausting the hignmem/normal zones then falling into the DMA zone 
and exhausting
that with non-reclamable memory like the slabcache.
