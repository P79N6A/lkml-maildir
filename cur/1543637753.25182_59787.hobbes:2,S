"USB mass storage" in general.
hcd-pci.c: uhci-hcd @ 00:07.2, Intel Corp. 82371AB PIIX4 USB
I don't think you need to search in this kind of direction.
The usb-storage code is just not very solid. It works more or less,
but it is really easy to provoke an oops.
Since there has been so much mail this evening, let me provoke an oops
just to show. Steps:
1. compile vanilla 2.5.29 with all built-in (also usb), except for
usb-storage.
2a. boot it, do nothing, reboot - all is fine
2b. boot it, insmod usb-storage, rmmod usb-storage, reboot - all is fine
2c. boot it, connect four CF/SM card readers to a hub. Mount usbdevfs.
    Look at them with usbview. Now insmod usb-storage. This generates some
    kernel messages about the probing, then silence. Wait for two minutes.
    Nothing. Still no prompt showing the completion of the insmod.
    Remove the four Smart Media card readers from the hub. No reaction.
    Ctrl-Alt-Del initiates a reboot, but the reboot hangs.
    Wait for a while. Nothing. Touch the (non-USB) keyboard. Oops.
This was a funny oops, rather different from those I usually see.
The stack trace was:
put_queue < handle_scancode < handle_kbd_event < update_wall_time <
timer_bh < keyboard_interrupt < handle_IRQ_event < do_IRQ <
default_idle < default_idle < common_interrupt < default_idle <
default_idle < default_idle < cpu_idle < rest_init.
