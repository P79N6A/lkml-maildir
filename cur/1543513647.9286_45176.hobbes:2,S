Hi,
I propose the patch attached below, for drivers/net/Config.in.
It fixes the case where CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL isn't set, which causes
CONFIG_LAPB not to be asked, which in turn causes CONFIG_LAPB to
be equal to "" instead of "n". (Kernel is 2.3.22, but 2.2.x has the same
problem and this patch should be applied there as well)
Greetings,
  Arjan van de Ven
