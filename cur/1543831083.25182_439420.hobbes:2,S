There were a lot of people who were concerned that simply marking it
CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL might not be enough for to make it very clear that
the filesystem format is still changing.  In order to address this
concern, we want /etc/fstab to make it abundantly clear that the
filesystem format itself is not necessarily stable, and that new
features are being added that might not be supported on older
kernels.
In general the same old rules will apply in that unless you explicitly
enable a feature via tune2fs or at mke2fs-time, it should work on
older kernels (just as in theory all of the kernel code that we are
throwing willy-nilly into userpsace is **supposed** to be forward
compatible), but if we paint ourselves in the a corner, there may be a
reason why we have to break that compatibility promise.
