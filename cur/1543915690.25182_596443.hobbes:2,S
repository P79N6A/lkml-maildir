Yeah, it's integrated gfx.  See the PRM at intel.com for the decode 
rules.
I've been following this thread and I see a lot of fear about moving to 
probing BARs as outlined in the PCI spec.  I haven't seen much in the 
way of hard evidence though, mostly just handwaving or red herrings 
(and even one comment implying that -mm wasn't a real testbed for 
patches) that don't have much to do with the actual "disable, size, 
re-enable" logic.  Has a conclusion been reached yet?
Keep in mind that any failures that occur due to this patch should be 
easy to track down (boot hang), but we have yet to see any in real 
life.  Moreover, reversion is trivial, and we could move to a more 
complex scheme at that time if needed, but why bother unless we're sure 
we need to?
Thanks,
Jesse
