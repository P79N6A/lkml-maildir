to be exact, it`s  CONFIG_FUSION_SPI and that makes mptspi build, which is
a driver for LSI53C1030 type controller, which also exists in real world.
vmware just emulates this hardware.

you are right, this is confiusing and confused me and others, too.
not a single word that this is for LSILogic type controllers.
Maybe that can/should be changed to "LSI Fusion MPT device support", "Say Y 
here to get to see options for drivers
based on LSI Fusion Message Passing Technology (MPT)"  !?

Speaking of which I remember how I was confused when I found out that this 
driver
is the linux driver for "SCI logic" SCSI vmware adapter :-)
