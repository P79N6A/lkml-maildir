And I guess some other people who want to see what prolbems there are
and what can't be solved between order-0 allocations and reserve zones.

Yeah higher order allocations could definitely be helpful for this although
I couldn't guess at the sort of impovements at this stage. And I mean if
there was a simple choice between better (but still not perfect) support
for higher order allocations or not, then of course you would take them.
I am sure there are other places as well where they might makes life a bit
easier or performance a bit better.
But given the code involved, it is not just a simple choice, but a
tradeoff. Perhaps I haven't seen or don't realise it, but I'm still not
sure that this tradeoff is a good one. (just my opinion).

My comments about defragmentation of the kernel were not exactly what
I believe is the right direction to go (it may be, but I'm rally not
in a position to know without having seen or tried to implement it). But
I do think that's what would really be needed in order to really support
higher order allocations the same as order-0.
I realise in your pragmatic approach, you are encouraging users to
put fallbacks in place in case a higher order page cannot be allocated,
but I don't think either higher order pagecache or higher order slubs
have such fallbacks (fsblock or a combination of fsblock and higher
order pagecache could have, but...).

Yeah I think that was a hack.
