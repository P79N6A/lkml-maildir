Well it will only "bounce" when the cacheline it is in is written to by
a different CPU. Considering this happens with your per-cpu implementation
_anyway_, they don't buy you anything much.
Putting it in __read_mostly means that you won't happen to share a cacheline
with a variable that is being written to frequently.
