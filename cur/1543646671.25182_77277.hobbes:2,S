I think a commit trigger is what you want:
	cd BitKeeper
	test -d triggers || mkdir triggers
	cd triggers
	cat > post-commit-linux-patches <<EOF
	#!/bin/sh
	(
	bk changes -v -r+
	bk export -tpatch -r+
	) | mail linux-patches@vger.kernel.edu
	EOF
	bk new post-commit-linux-patches
	bk commit -y'Mail patches to linux-patches'
I haven't tested this but I think this will work, it will mail the patches as
they are created, not as they move through the trees.
