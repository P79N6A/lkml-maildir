Well, I've just seen some benchmarks of this kind with CFS and it does make a 
difference. The scalability problem with MySQL seems to get solved with this 
scheduler. However, the peak throughput is quite lower than with the same 
kernel/glibc version and mainline scheduler.

Anyway, this kind of testing seems to be useful. Linux is too widely deployed 
in servers to ignore the behavior of a CPU scheduler in that scenario.
Cheers,
Alberto.
