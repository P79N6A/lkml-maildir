There seem to be a problem with the opl3sa2 driver with some
YMF chips. The driver does a test on some register bits that is
supposed to be read only. But they seem to be read/write in some
chip-versions and the test fails. I've commented out the "return 0;"
statement after the "opl3sa2: Control I/O port"... message and then
everything works as expected. This is with 2.4.12 but this problem
as been around for quite a while. The machine is a Toshiba Tecra 8000.
