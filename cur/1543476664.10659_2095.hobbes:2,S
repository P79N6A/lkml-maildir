SD> I tried to use linuxconf to add alias to eth0 (eth0:0) but it won't activate the aliases for me, claiming that the alias support isn't in the kernel. I can't find and pseudo item with /proc that say alias, so I'm no understanding what that's about. The kernel does have alias included, and I have tried this now with 3 different compiles of kernel, so I can't have messed it up all times! See bottom for relevant part of .config for kernel 2.2.0.
Seems that linuxconf is not linux-2.2 compatible/aware. The alias
interface and semantics have changed. Linuxconf probably need updating.
Probably another problem why RH 5.2 is not Linux 2.2 compatible :(
