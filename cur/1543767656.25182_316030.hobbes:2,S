Tom,
Sorry about this, but the fix only works if schedule_work() is used
instead of schedule_delayed_work() for the pre-redux relayfs patch.  I
only realised this recently since I have been using the "flush" fix on
a pre-redux relayfs port to 2.4 which doesn't doesn't have an
equivalent of schedule_delayed_work() and have only tried it on 2.6
today.
Using flush_scheduled_work() with schedule_delayed_work() doesn't work
since schedule_delay_work() uses a timer to queue work at the
appropriate time.  Although all uses of schedule_delay_work() in
relayfs adds work to the queue a tick later, this time delay is enough
for flush_schedule_work() to flushes what is presently on the queue
before the timer actually expires.  eventd would then attempt to use a
work_struct that has then been initialised by relay_reset().
With schedule_work() is instead of schedule_delayed_work() I haven't
seen the race happen.
Thanks,
