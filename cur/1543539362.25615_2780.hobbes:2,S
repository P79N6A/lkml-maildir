You do realize that unless you have the client(s) process the same
workunit, your tests are skewed anyways...Some workunits take much more
time to complete than others.
FWIW, it takes my SMP 2xPIII/600B 128MB RAM 7 hr 47 minutes on average to
complete 2 units.
It takes my Sun Ultra 10 (UltraSparc IIi 333MHz) 768MB RAM 7 hr 20
minutes on avg. to complete one unit.
I homestly can't see your problem; Could you elaborate please?
