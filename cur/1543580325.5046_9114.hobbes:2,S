My problem had nothing to do with disk access. Keyboard input isn't
slowed by disk access.  I knew that... In any case, sub-486 speeds
aren't attained through using PIO instead of UDMA... my 486 uses PIO
disks anyway, so it's moot.  The real culprit was ACPI, which is having
some temporary problems.  I turned it off and everything's great
(thanks, Andrew).
