I just added an ami megaraid card to a machine. I configured the 6  9gb
drives to look like 3 18gb drives and then booted. Linux only saw 2 of
the 3 drive.  I think got the latest kernel and compiled and rebooted
and the same below is the relevant dmesg info.  It says it detected 3
logical drives but the driver only uses two of them.
I really need this other drive so any help would be appreciated.
