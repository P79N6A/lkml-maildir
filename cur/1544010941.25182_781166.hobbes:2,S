Good point.

I think the SPARSMEM limit problem only happens in the !VMEMMAP case.
It might be better to just disable the config option for !VMEMMAP,
afaik on 64bit NUMA you always want to have VMEMMAP enabled anyways.
That would avoid that particular limit at least and be in general 
more efficient.
Like in this patch.

Always enable vmemmap on x86-64 NUMA
To my knowledge vmemap is the most efficient option on x86-64, so there's no
sense in supporting old style non virtual sparsemem too. On 32bit x86
it still makes some sense due to the limited address space.
