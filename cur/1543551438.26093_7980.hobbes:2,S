Hi list,
There seem to be two common methods for ix86-based boards to enable the
A20 line: The traditional method that uses the keyboard controller (this
is what Linux supports) and a method (sometimes referred to as "fast
A20 Gate") that uses a special port address (0x92).
Some boards (especially in the embedded PC area) implement only the
latter method (some don't even _have_ a keyboard controller).
With these boards, Linux fails to boot.
The fix for this is pretty simple (see below) and I wonder if it
would be possible to get this fix into the kernel by default.
Cheers
Rob
