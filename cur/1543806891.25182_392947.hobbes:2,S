Unfortunately there are many times when this simply isn't an option. 
I'm currently working on boards that simply are not supported on 2.4. 
Thus either we need to track 2.6, or else we need to pay someone to do 
it for us and hope they do a good job.
Of course what actually happens is that you pick a kernel version 
(hopefully you pick well) and then backport fixes.  Upgrading 
continuously simply isn't an option, as we have multiple vendors 
providing BSPs, drivers, patches, etc. and they're all supported only 
for that specific kernel version.  We can really only upversion the 
kernel once a year or so, if that often.
