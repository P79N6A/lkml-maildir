Ok. Especially if it seems that -mjb4 also potentially does it (just
harder to trigger), I don't see many other alternatives than just going
back in time to see when it started.
But if it was getting hard to trigger with 2.5.52 too, things might be
getting hairier and hairier.. If it becomes hard enough to trigger as to
be practically nondeterministic, a better approach might be to just go
back to -mjb4, and even if it is still there in -mjb4 try to see which
part of the patch seems to be making it more stable. That might give us
more clues, and it's a much smaller problem set than going arbitrarily far
back in the 2.5.x series.
