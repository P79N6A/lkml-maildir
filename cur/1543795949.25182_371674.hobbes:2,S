Any modules built by the official Makefile method will atomatically 
pick up the necessary changes to the compiler flags, and the ABI 
presented to userspace is unchanged.
Also, part of the patch series is needed in order to introduce colouring 
of the kernel stack (namely divorcing the relationship of thread_info 
with the stack pointer).
