Linux SMP assumes cache coherent hardware.  From a note by David Miller
to l-k in 1996 and AFAIK never rescinded :-
                e) Currently, it is assumed that coherence in a
                   multiprocessor environment is maintained by the
                   cache/memory subsystem.  That is to say, when
                   one processor requests a datum on the memory bus
                   and another processor has a more uptodate copy,
                   by whatever means the requestor will get the
                   uptodate copy owned by the other processor.
        (NOTE: SMP architectures without hardware cache coherence
               mechanisms are indeed possible, the current flush
               architecture does not handle this currently.  If at
               at some point a Linux port to some system where this
               is an issue occurrs, I will add the necessary hooks.
               But it will not be pretty.)
