Well the firmware is compiled to bytes within the _same_file_ as
the rest of the kernel.  That would match the usage of "inside" the
kernel.  Even if it's just a file with firmware bytes distributed in the
same tar file it's still very iffy.

But we're not talking about an instance of aggregation here, this
is a derivative work.
