Subject: [PATCH] scsi_error: Fix language abuse.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The word "illegal" has a precise dictionary meaning of "prohibited by
law". The error messages are therefore incorrect as so far nobody has
made SCSI violations a criminal offence.
This corrects scsi to match various other subsystems I've slowly been
ridding of this.
