I think this is a good approach.  If people sent Linus patches with some
indication of the baseline of the patch, such as BASELINE=v2.5.49 in the
header of the patch,  I'd be willing to go make bk import -temail do 
the right thing, which would probably be to try and patch it in in the
working tree, but if that didn't work, it would do
	bk clone -l -r$BASELINE tree tree.$BASELINE
	cd tree.$BASLINE
	bk import -temail ....
	cd ../tree
	bk pull ../tree.$BASELINE  && rm -rf ../tree.$BASELINE
and you'd get BK to merge most of the work.
