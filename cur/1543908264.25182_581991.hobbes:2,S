All this might explain some of the IRQ loss, I saw with sky2 on mac mini.
Basically, the device would act like it missed an IRQ. The chip and PCI registers
all said "device has asserted IRQ" but the IRQ handler never got called.
Then again, the problem might be completely different since this was with
PCI-E with either MSI or INTA mode.
The workaround was to perodically call the soft IRQ handler and that would
clear the IRQ, but it's not something I want to keep.
