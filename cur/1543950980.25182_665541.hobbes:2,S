I do not think so.
Is it really an issue, or is it just a warning message unread/unfollowed?
I am comparing the last line you quoted from the command output in that
message, which suggests the user to run 'git prune', and your comment on
the next line in that message that says "I regularly run 'git gc'", and
scratching my head.  I cannot tell if you regularly run 'git prune' or not
from it...
