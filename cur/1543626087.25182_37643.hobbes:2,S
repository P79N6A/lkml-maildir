Yeah, a lot of newbies think that :)

If the usage of the type is hard to search for then
then wrong identifier was chosen.

memset will run at up to twice the speed (according to
Arjan).  Dunno if this includes I-cache misses - probably
not.
I'm not particularly fussed about this one, but I do prefer
the sleep-at-night safety of a blanket memset.  Because
(and I think this is something on which you and I somewhat
differ) code should be written for the convenience of others,
not the original author.  A nice memset will leave no doubt
in the reader's mind that all members of the structure have
been initialised.
BTW, Linus: while we're on the topic, I think we should do
this again:
