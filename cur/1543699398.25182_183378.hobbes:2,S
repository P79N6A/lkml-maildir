No.

Yes.  Well, no... I don't see that option in my .config.  I
did specify the amd64 bit archictecture, but I don't know
what that means in .config terms.  Here's what's set under
"# Processor type and features":
CONFIG_X86_PC=y
CONFIG_MK8=y
CONFIG_X86_CMPXCHG=y
CONFIG_X86_XADD=y
CONFIG_X86_L1_CACHE_SHIFT=6

Ok, I guess I'll try that (tomorrow, unless I hear any better suggestions
before then).
[I thought highmem was something completely different -- that it declared
a watermark and memory above that watermark was treated differently.
However, I guess I understand that this might have the side effect of
bumping things around such that I get access to the memory.]
