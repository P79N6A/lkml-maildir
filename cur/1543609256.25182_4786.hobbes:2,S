Hi,
I am trying to write a kernel module which reads the files in the /proc 
directory.
When I do an insmod filename.o, I get the following error:
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address....
In the module, I use kmalloc to allocate memory. Is that the reason I am 
getting this error?
I am very new to writing kernel modules, I would really appreciate a reply.
Thanks,
Femitha Majeed
