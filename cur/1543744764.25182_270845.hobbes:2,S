Alexander van Heukelum noted to me that addw here modifies CF, so I
think something like should fix that.  Christian, if you're in a
position to test this, I'd really appreciate it.  You've been a
fantastic bug reporter / tester!
Not ready for Linus yet, and you'll need to re-apply the previous
edd.S patch which is now reverted in Linus's tree.  As your BIOS
reports via CHECK EXTENSIONS PRESENT that you've got more devices than
you actually have, hopefully the int13 EXTENDED READ won't succeed for
non-existant devices anymore, and then neither will the READ SECTORS
call.
