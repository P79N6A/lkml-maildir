Compare it to the background scan of the queue if several (potentially
numerous) events whose handling has been deferred are to be processed
when timer device interrupts are delivered at irregular intervals, or
not at all.

Naive schemes reprogram the timer device too frequently. Software
constructs are less of a concern. This also presumes that taking timer
interrupts when cpu-intensive workloads voluntarily yield often enough
is necessary or desirable. This is not so in virtualized environments,
and unnecessary interruption of userspace also degrades performance.
