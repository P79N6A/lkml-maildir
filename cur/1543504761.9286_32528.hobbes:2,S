Actually, they didn't seem too annoyed by the patch I sent them:
  <
http://gcc.cygnus.com/ml/gcc/1999-07/threads.html>
Search for "norestrict" and browse the discussion.  (Yeah, it's long.)
To summarize, at least a few of the GCC people liked the concept,
although "__typealias" is a better name for it.  I intend to clean up
the patch and submit it again after the 2.95 aftershocks die down.
