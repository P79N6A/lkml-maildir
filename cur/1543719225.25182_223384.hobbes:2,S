I've been looking at this and the culprit is in
drivers/char/tty_io.c, function do_tty_hangup():
	lock_kernel();
        ...
	/* FIXME! What are the locking issues here? This may me overdoing things..
	* this question is especially important now that we've removed the irqlock. */
	{
		unsigned long flags;
		local_irq_save(flags); // FIXME: is this safe?
		if (tty->ldisc.flush_buffer)
			tty->ldisc.flush_buffer(tty);
		if (tty->driver->flush_buffer)
			tty->driver->flush_buffer(tty);
		if ((test_bit(TTY_DO_WRITE_WAKEUP, &tty->flags)) &&
		    tty->ldisc.write_wakeup)
			(tty->ldisc.write_wakeup)(tty);
		local_irq_restore(flags); // FIXME: is this safe?
	}
        ...
	unlock_kernel();
I do not see that disabling the local CPU interrupts for the
flush_buffer and write_wakeup calls is needed. In fact
doing so provokes the warning message in softirq.c
when write_wakeup is called.
All of these functions are also invoked by ioctl calls
which do not disable the local IRQ (ioctl is protected
by lock_kernel/unlock_kernel just like do_tty_hangup).
So the flush_buffer/write_wakeup calls do *not*
need IRQs disabled (in fact need them enabled to
avoid the warning as is the case on ioctl).
Since the IRQ is restored immediately after these 3
calls, it does not seem to serve a purpose for the calling
function either.
The solution, in my opinion, is to remove the IRQ
disabling surrounding these 3 functions in do_tty_hangup.
