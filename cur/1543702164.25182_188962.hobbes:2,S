Ok, how should it be done on my SCSI and parallel port ZIP? An ATAPI ZIP
with 2.4 behaves like that:
nectarine:~ # blockdev --rereadpt /dev/hdd
/dev/hdd: Eingabe-/Ausgabefehler
nectarine:~ # dmesg | tail
nfs: server Hilbert2 OK
nfs: server Hilbert3 not responding, still trying
nfs: server Hilbert3 OK
nfs: server Hilbert3 not responding, still trying
nfs: server Hilbert3 OK
nfs: server Hilbert2 not responding, still trying
nfs: server Hilbert2 OK
ide-floppy: hdd: I/O error, pc =  0, key =  2, asc = 3a, ascq =  0
ide-floppy: hdd: I/O error, pc = 1b, key =  2, asc = 3a, ascq =  0
hdd: No disk in drive
nectarine:~ # cat /proc/ide/hdd/model 
IOMEGA ZIP 100 ATAPI
I have not checked 2.6, but I doubt it is smarter.
