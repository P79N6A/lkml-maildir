Hi
Today it happened to me twice that i deleted a file (both around 400MB)
while i burned a DVD from the same partition. (Second time was a
"mistake", i deleted the file 10 minutes earlier and the system locked up
the moment the program, that had the file open, terminated)
The system just locked up hard, cdrecord was able to show a "sense key"
error (sorry, haven't written the message down) and then i had to press
the big red switch.
Kernel is 2.4.21 with only loop-aes-patch (wasn't in used)
System is a Dual-PIII-933Mhz.
Data-HDD is "standard" IDE drive. Connected to a Highpoint RocketRAID 1540
(374 Chipset)
DVD-Burner is connected via Firewire.
If any more details are need, i will provide them.
Bis denn

wants a "you asked for it, you got it" text editor -- complicated,
cryptic, powerful, unforgiving, dangerous.
