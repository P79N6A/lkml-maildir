In Linux 2.4.31 scsi_do_req() still inserts at the tail. This was also 
valid until 2.6.5.
James, is the change you inserted in Linux 2.6.5 still relevant in 2.6 
today?

        [PATCH] add device quiescing to the SCSI API
        This patch adds the ability to quiesce a SCSI device.  The idea 
is that
        user issued commands (including filesystem ones) would get blocked,
        while mid-layer and device issued ones would be allowed to proceed.
        This is for things like Domain Validation which like to operate 
on an
        otherwise quiet device.
        There is one big change: to get all of this to happen correctly,
        scsi_do_req() has to queue on the *head* of the request queue, 
not the
        tail as it was doing previously.  The reason is that deferred 
requests
        block the queue, so anything needing executing after a deferred 
request
        has to go in front of it.  I don't think there are any untoward
        consequences of this.
