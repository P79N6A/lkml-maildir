Subject: [GIT PATCH] STAGING patches for 2.6-git
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/28/460

Here are some tiny staging patches that fix some build errors and common
Kconfig problems that people have reported.  There are also a few other
minor, "obvious" bugfixes to some of the drivers as well and a
documentation update.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/staging-2.6.git/
All but one of these have been in the -next releases with no known build
errors.  The one that wasn't was pointed out to me by Randy Dunlap and
fixes a build issue on 64bit boxes that he found.
The patches will be sent as a follow-on to this message to lkml for people
to see.
thanks,
greg k-h
