Ok, I tested it with the broken image.
It looks like "readdir()" is ok now (but not really knowing what the right
output should be I cannot guarantee that). HOWEVER, doing an "ls -l" on
some of the files gets ENOENT, implying that "lookup()" still has some
problems with the image.
I suspect the code to handle split entries in isofs_find_entry() has some
simple bug, but I'm too lazy to check it out right now. Anybody else
willing to finish this one off?
