This is a module limitation... the scsi structures are static so the
kernel needs to know how many drives are in the system. This is calculated
at boot by initializing all the scsi controllers.  In the case of modules,
that doesn't work -- the scsi core has to be loaded before the scsi
controller (chicken and the egg.)  There are #define's to set the amount
of slack for disks, cdroms, and tapes.
In the 2.3 series, it's a configuration option.  In previous kernels, it's
in drivers/scsi/hosts.h (look for EXTRA_DEVS.)
