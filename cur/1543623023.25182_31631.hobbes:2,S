Ben,
Actually, would you just e-mail URLs to these patches?
It looks like the eepro100 one, mysterious as it is, is ok.  The others
I have different plans for:  making them act similar to the recent
8139cp changes.
So, the other patches will be immensely useful to me, but only as
reference, not to be directly applied...
	Jeff
