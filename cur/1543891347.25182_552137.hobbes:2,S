few minutes ago.  Thanks for smoking it out.
If, as I suggested in my previous message to which you are

then it looks safe to me, without having to add the bogus "+1" to
the allocated size.  That is, I suspect the following patch fixes
this long standing cpuset bug (warning - white space mangled):
