FWIW, Debian's current stable release (slink, 2.1) ships with a working
ping.

IIRC, the real problem is that when listening on a raw socket you now
get to see your outgoing pings as well as the incoming responses, so a
new ping gets sent off every time it sends a ping as well as every time
it receives a ping, which just leads to confusion all around.
