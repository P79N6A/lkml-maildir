As a followup to my own post, here's some results:
v2.3.17 -- Works
v2.3.18 -- Works
v2.3.19 -- Works
v2.3.20 -- Works
v2.3.21 -- Doesn't compile
v2.3.22 -- Works ... Ehmm... Oops:ed om me on reboot, but still...
v2.3.23 -- Panic on boot
v2.3.24 -- Panic on boot
v2.3.25 -- Panic on boot
v2.3.26 -- Panic on boot
Works only specifies that it works fine to boot; I haven't done any
extensive testing.
Now there's only the "small" quest of finding what differs between
v2.3.22 that boots, and v2.3.23 that panics...
I haven't tried v2.3.27 yet, but I wouldn't hold my hopes too high
that it would work.
