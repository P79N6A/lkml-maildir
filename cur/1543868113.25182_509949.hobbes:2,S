You misunderstand what I'm saying. If you have two works, A and B, and
neither is a derivative work of the other, linking the two of them together
does not create a new work, so it cannot create a derivative work. The
result still could be work A or work B (or both of them).
If you make a copy of a disk, you have not created a new work. However, the
result of that copy is still the original work.
As a more accurate example, suppose I take a DVD of The Phantom Menace and
convert it to AVI format. The result is not a new work for copyright
purposes, it's just The Phantom Menace. If I take The Phantom Menace and The
Big Lebowski and put them in a program that alternates frames, the result is
not a new work (unless you can argue there was some creativity in choosing
to combine those two works) but is simply The Big Lebowski and The Phanton
Menace, just as if I had put the two DVDs in one box.

That cannot be, because the output is not a new work. Only a creative
process can create a new work.

Correct. That is a separate argument that certainly might be reasonable
under some circumstances. We're dealing with two seprate arguments here, one
reasonable and one unreasonable. The reasonable one (though I think it's
incorrect here) that if you use EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL symbols, your code likely
has so much knowledge of (and code from) the Linux kernel that it must be a
derivative work. The unreasonable one is that linking creates a derivative
work. No automated process can create a new work for copyright purposes.
And on to the other argument:

I disagree with the premise, but even assuming it were true, the answer is
no. First, you cannot compare functional works to non-functional works in
this context because this exception is specifically about functional works.
But second, the premise is wrong.
You are correct that there is no other way to express this idea this way.
But that is always true of any work. However, there are other ways to
express the same idea. (Not precisely the same. Arguably if you change the
name of Romeo to Robert and leave everything else in Romeo and Juliet the
same, it's a different idea.) I agree that this distinction (between an idea
and an expression) is not always perfectly clear in copyright, but these are
two cases where it *is* clear.

The fact that this is impractical and it's the only other way to accomplish
the same function proves that you don't need to do it. Copyright does not
allow you to own every practical way to achieve a function or even express
an idea.
