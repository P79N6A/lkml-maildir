I took a closer look and it's indeed quite broken.  If XMMS is run in
realtime mode, and multithreading is enabled, it runs everything
SCHED_RR - GUI, audio, spectrum analyzer.  (And since it relies on new
threads inheriting RT scheduling when pthread_create()'d, the threads
will fail to get SCHED_RR on buggy NPTL versions like the one in Debian
Sarge).
This untested patch should enable RT scheduling for only the (ALSA)
audio thread.  Make sure NOT to run in realtime mode.
