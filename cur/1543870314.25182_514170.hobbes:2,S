Beware with that approach though. If you are on a shared IRQ line, when
do you start getting called when an IRQ happen (possibly for the "other"
device) ? As soon as you are bound to the device ? But that means
potentially before the driver internal data structures are fully
initialized...
I like the driver having in control the "hooking" of the irq handler,
thus, when it starts being capable of handling interrupts (even if they
aren't initiated by that driver's device).
