Hi John,
Thank you for your comments.
I agree to your description of keyboards and character sets.

But I haven't completely understand why the keycode of yen-"solid
vertical line" was changed.
(1) Backslash-underscore key (scancode 0x73) and yen-"solid vertical
    line" key (scancode 0x7d) were given different keycodes (89 and
    124) in Linux 2.4 . Do we have to change the keycode of yen-"solid
    vertical line" key (scancode 0x7d) in Linux 2.6?
(2) I don't see why the new keycode is 183. Yen in Unicode is 165.
(3) The topic is keycode of the key having scancode 0x7d. In my
    understanding, the assignment of keycodes has little to do with
    what is printed on key top. Key tops are taken care by keymaps
    loaded by loadkeys(1).
(4) Are there other keyboards having the key with scancode 0x7d? If
    there are keyboards with scancode 0x7d in other languages, we
    should take them into account.
