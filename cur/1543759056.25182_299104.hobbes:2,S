I think so.

We can do 2.6.11.x scheme. For the last stable kernel, of course
(i.e., one additional small patchset). No more 2.6.11.x when 2.6.12
is out.

Yes.
But, to shorten the time between stable kernels, I would limit
number of "pre"s. Maybe 1 or even no "pre" kernel is enough?
Massive updates would take place before rc1 is released, of course.
