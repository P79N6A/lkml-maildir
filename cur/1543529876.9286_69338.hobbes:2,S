Note that these issues are completely off the map of what is really
meaningful at this point.
We want to avoid having long latencies, and we can easily get that by just
allowing timer interrupts to schedule which we're in a big
"memcpy_to_user()" and we don't hold any kernel lock etc. No need to try
to be clever at lock release time - if we get a pending reschedule, we
might as well leave it pending, it's going to be serviced soon enough
anyway.
If you really want hard realtime, go to work with Victor and RTLinux..
