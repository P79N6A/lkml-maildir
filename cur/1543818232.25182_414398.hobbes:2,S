In most cases.  It is possible you got the executable through
file descriptor passing and the like.
The security check in -mm allows anyone who may ptrace the
process to have read access.  In 2.6.17-rc1 the check is
still the owner of the process and anyone with CAP_DAC_ACCESS
may read or use the link.
