Yeah, if only the company that has invested millions in trying to scratch
out a place to stand, if only they would give us their intellectual
property for free, if only, why then we could steal that IP and give it
to other people.  And it would take us less time to do it if they would
only cooperate.  Why won't they cooperate?
How dare they not give of the fruits of their labors for free.
Give it up, Stallman, we live in a capitalistic world.  The Russians
tried communism and it didn't work.  It won't work here either, the
kernel folks aren't that stupid.  Some people actually do learn from
history.
