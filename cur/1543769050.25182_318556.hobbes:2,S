Hi,
this not round robin but the traffic is spread over more GW's
config IP_ROUTE_MULTIPATH
        bool "IP: equal cost multipath"
        depends on IP_ADVANCED_ROUTER
        help
          Normally, the routing tables specify a single action to be taken in
          a deterministic manner for a given packet. If you say Y here
          however, it becomes possible to attach several actions to a packet
          pattern, in effect specifying several alternative paths to travel
          for those packets. The router considers all these paths to be of
          equal "cost" and chooses one of them in a non-deterministic fashion
          if a matching packet arrives.

If everyone used log base e, we'd all be happy!
