this was indeed the problem.  upgrading to glibc-2.1.1 fixed it quite
handily.  i suppose i should've gone with my gut feeling and tried this
before i posted ... i think i just subconsciously remember the first time
i did a major library upgrade and ended up with no libc.so... and didn't
know about sln. ;)
thanks to everyone who responded!
