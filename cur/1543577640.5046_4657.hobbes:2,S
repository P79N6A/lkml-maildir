Hmmm, it's magically appeared :P
As far as the stability goes, this is one of my current hang-ups - I've
heard about the loopback stuff in 2.4. I want to use 2.4 but I can't use
any of my systems without crypto (and hence loopback) since key personal
data is stored therein and I don't want to sacrifice stability.

Indeed. I wish I could help improve things - I'm not really in the game
yet although I want to be and I am working towards that.

Indeed I am interested - I've been using it for quite some time - I
really don't know why I overlooked that list.
