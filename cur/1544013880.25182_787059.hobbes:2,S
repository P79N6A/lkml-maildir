Subject: [PATCH] missing include in cxgb3i
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/5/302

it needs scatterlist.h - indirect chain of includes doesn't work on
a lot of targets.
