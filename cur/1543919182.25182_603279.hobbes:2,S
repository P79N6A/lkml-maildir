I did something like this a while ago for another scheduling project.
A couple 'possible' optimizations to think about are:
1) Only scan the remote runqueues once and keep a local copy of the
   remote priorities for subsequent 'scans'.  Accessing the remote
   runqueus (CPU specific cache lines) can be expensive.
2) When verifying priorities, just perform spin_trylock() on the remote
   runqueue.  If you can immediately get it great.  If not, it implies
   someone else is messing with the runqueue and there is a good chance
   the data you pre-fetched (curr->Priority) is invalid.  In this case
   it might be faster to just 'move on' to the next candidate runqueue/CPU.
   i.e. The next highest priority that the new task can preempt.
Of course, these 'optimizations' would change the algorithm.  Trying to
make any decision based on data that is changing is always a crap shoot. :)
