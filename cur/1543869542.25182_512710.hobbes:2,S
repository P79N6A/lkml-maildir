<inttypes.h> is a superset of <stdint.h>; some older platforms don't 
have <stdint.h> (but has all the contents thereof in <inttypes.h>) however.
In general <inttypes.h> is what you want.  The utility of <stdint.h> is 
relatively limited; it looks like it's intended so that <stdint.h> 
contains the compiler-specific portions rather than the library-specific 
portions.
