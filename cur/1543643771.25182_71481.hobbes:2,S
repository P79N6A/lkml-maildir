High Greg,
Yes he did. Same results.
Same for dd from either sda or sda1 as well.
I get the feeling it's not a true mass storage device.
The windows drivers talk about TWAIN. And the vendor ID
is for ViewQuest Technologies, which has a similar camera,
also with TWAIN drivers. I can send you the drivers from both
if you think they would help.
