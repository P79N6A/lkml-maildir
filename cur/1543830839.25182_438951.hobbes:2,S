Well, some architectures may have working PROT_WRITE without
PROT_READ. If you are careful and code your userland application in
assembly, it should work okay.
On processors where that combination depends randomly depending on
phase of moon (i386, apparently), I guess change is okay. But the
patch disabled PROT_WRITE w/o PROT_READ on _all_ processors.
