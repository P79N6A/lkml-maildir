Whether those actions constitute protected copying or modification is
irrelevant[1].  Section 2 of the GPL is quite clear that it only
requires GPL licensing of works that one distributes.  It allows me to
copy, modify and otherwise create derivative works; the requirement to
license those works under the GPL applies when I distribute them.
(Because Broadcom does distribute those derivative works contrary to
the GPL, I suspect they are directly infringing.  My main point is
that your argument about users infringing the GPL is wrong, and
therefore so is the argument about contributory infringement.)
[1]- If you mean cases I think you do, they were the inspiration for
Title III of the DMCA, which added the repair and maintenance
exceptions in 17 USC 117(c) and (d).

My understanding is that the Objective C front-end was a derivative of
the gcc back-end for reasons unrelated to who did the linking, and
that was what convinced NeXT.
