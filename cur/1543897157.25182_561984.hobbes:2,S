Hi, Paul,
I am not a CLUI expert, but rounding off bytes will something that
the administrators will probably complain about. Since we manage
the controller memory in pages, it might be the easiest unit to use.
The output is totally different matter.
Having said that, I am not opposed to your suggestion, I'll see if
I can find good CLUI guidelines.
