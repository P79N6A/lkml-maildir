Hi,
I am using a CMI8330 based audio chip which works fine with Windows 98.
On a Redhat Linux 6.1; kernel 2.2.12-20, however, despite my best efforts -
changing the isapnp.conf file, recompiling the kernel to make sure that
sound is compiled as a module - I cannot get the Sound Blaster driver to get
loaded.
A 'modprobe sb' (after suitable /etc/conf.modules) always results in the
uart401, sound and sound soundcore modules to be loaded BUT not the sb
module ----- The message is always --- init: device or resoiurce busy.
Any solutions to this problem????
Thanks,
Arnab
