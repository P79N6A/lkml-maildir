Hmmm, since when?  The most recent kernel with a cdrom attached I have
handy is a 2.6.14-rc2, and it does not give a "media" entry.
/proc/ide has it though.  Of course, I'd hoped the point of sysfs and
SG_IO was not to have to care whether it's scsi, ide, usb or something
else underlying...

Indeed, since the model is not given in sysfs, at least with
2.6.14-rc2 or previous.  There too, /proc/ide has it.  I also have no
idea what that "GSA" thing is either.

Me too.  But at this point it looks like we have to go back to the
good old "scan /dev/hd?, /dev/scd*, /dev/sr*, /dev/sg* and pray".
Pity.
  OG.
