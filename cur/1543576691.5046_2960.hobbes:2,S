When I do a "shutdown -h now" in Slackware 7.1 with the
2.4.0-test13-pre4 kernel, sometimes after the words "Power down" appear
I get the message:
ACPI: S5 Failed
(I think that's the phrasing, of course since it only happens when I
shutdown for the night my memory is a little fuzzy).
It doesn't appear to cause any actual trouble but I thought I should
report it because it's out of the ordinary.
This is with an ASUS p3v4x mothboard, Pentium III 667 MHz, 128 MB 133
MHz ram, Adaptec 29160 Ultra160 SCSI Host Bus Adapter.  It has an
ATI XPert 2000 video card with AGP and DRM enabled in the kernel.
The kernel is built for SMP but it's not an SMP motherboard.
