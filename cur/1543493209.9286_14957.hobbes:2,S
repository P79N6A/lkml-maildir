Similar problem with Tripwire 2.0, it breaks on glibc-2.1 whenever
lstat hits a non-existent file.  No idea if it is a glibc or tripwire
problem, no source for tripwire 2 :(.
A general workaround for programs that need glibc 2.0.  Install the
glibc-2.0.7 files, including ld-linux.so.2 and ld-2.0.7.so in
/lib-2.0.7.  Create a script called use-2.0.7
#!/bin/sh
# use-2.0.7
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib-2.0.7/ /lib-2.0.7/ld-linux.so.2 "$@"
Invove all programs that need glibc-2.0.7 as
use-2.0.7 /path/to/binary options
You have to specify the full path to the offending binaries.
