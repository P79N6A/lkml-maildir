Title says it.  Vanilla 2.6.5 kernel built with the same .config options
as its predecessor (2.6.4, which prints just fine over parport).  My
HP2200 is being properly detected by the parport probe, but no output ever
reaches it.
I've temporarily switched to a USB connection, which works fine.  
Reverting the patches to parport_pc.c and lp.c failed to restore 
operation.
