but his example fcloses a file which was not opened. This isn't "further
access".
Is it difficult for Linux to spot the the file isn't open and return EBADF?  
What does POSIX have to say about this? IMHO making it easier to port your
programs to Linux (and behaving a little more sanely :) is worth a couple of
extra bytes of anyone's kernel.
