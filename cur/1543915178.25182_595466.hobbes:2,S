Subject: [PATCH 00/33] Rename "Task Containers" to "Control Groups"
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patchset renames "Task Containers" to "Control Groups", in line with
recent discussions.
These patches are drop-in replacements for those of the same names in
the current -mm tree, as listed at the bottom of this email. I have
tried to keep the patch names (based on the description lines of each
patch) the same even where such patch names refer to "containers"
rather than "cgroups" - hopefully after these have been imported into
-mm, Andrew can rename the patches in his quilt stack.
Note that the Signed-off-by lines in these patches (other than mine)
refer to the original versions of these patches, before the rename. I
believe that all such original authors were Cc'd on the review email
last week and no-one has objected to the rename.
The new patches are constructed by running the following perl script
over the original versions of the patches in 2.6.23-rc4-mm1 (and others seen on mm-commits since then):
perl -pi -e 's/subcontainer/child cgroup/g; s/(\b|_)container(\b|_(?!of)|fs|s)/$1cgroup$2/g; s/CONTAINER(_|S)/CGROUP$1/g; s/Container/Control Group/g; s/css_group/css_set/g;' patches/*.patch
Owners of other control-group related patches may want to run this
script or some variation of it on their own patches.
