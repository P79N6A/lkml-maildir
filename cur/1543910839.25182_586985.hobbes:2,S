Thanks to Richard for the "aboot" fixes.
I'm seeing something new and strange with 2.6.23-rc3 that I wasn't
seeing in the 2.6.22+ kernels.  I've got the bootlogo code enabled,
and at the point during system initialization where the logo
disappears, the console switches from tty1 to tty2.  I can switch
back to tty1, so other than the unexpected console tty switch, there
doesn't seem to be anything "unfortunate" happening.
Any ideas/explanations?  It's completely repeatable.  I don't think
it's related to the "aboot" patches :-).
