I had an AMD K6 200 with an ISA NE2K card whan I started using Linux...
I started using kernel 2.0 and that card worked very nice.
I could even play quake while sending out data at 10Mbit/s, I didn't even
notice that the transfer had started.
Then I upgraded to kernel 2.2 and I was no longer able to play quake while
tranmitting at 10Mbit/s with the exact same hardware. Sometimes I could
hardly even play mp3's :(
Then a friend of mine that also upgraded to kernel 2.2 began complaining
that his machine also became extremely slow and unresponsive while
transitting at 10Mbit/s, in fact that machine was even slower than mine
during the transfers and his cpu was a bit faster than mine (also AMD).
Then I upgraded that machine to pIII 700 and even that machine slows to a
crawl while transmitting with that bloody ISA NE2K. It's the same thing in
kernel 2.4 too. These days I simply don't use that card anymore...
So something seems to have taken a wrong turn between 2.0 and 2.2
I don't think this is a problem intruduced in 2.4.

Never argue with an idiot. They drag you down to their level, then beat you with experience.
