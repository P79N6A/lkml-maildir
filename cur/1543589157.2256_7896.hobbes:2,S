I was wondering if anyone could tell me who is responsible for the patch I
have included?  It fixes some issues with scanning the scsi bus,
specifically it reports luns higher than 8.  I am just wondering if whoever
has created this if they have submitted it to be included in the mainstream
2.2.x kernel series.
