Hello there!
I am the lucky owner of a Wacom Graphire 2 tablet, which works great with the 
latest 2.4-kernels. However, the 2.6-drive is unusually and utterly broken. 
Frankly, it doesn't work at all.
When I load up X11 with the proper /dev-symlinks and all that stuff in place 
(2.6 names the tablet /dev/input/event1 as opposed to 2.4, which names it /
dev/input/event0), the tablet simply doesn't respond. I can see in my 
XFree86.0.log file that the tablet is recognized correctly by the kernel, but 
that's about it.
Of course, I tried the linux-wacom (linux-wacom.sourceforge.net) drivers, but 
they fail to compile most miserably (the beta dev-version). From what I could 
deduce of the compiler output, it is incompatible with 2.6.
I filed a bug report a long time ago (2.5.65-ish), but no one really seemed to 
care.
I would really like some info on what progress is being made in this area, as 
it currently is the only thing stopping me from switching seriously to 2.6.
I suppose it is also one of those drivers that Linus keeps talking about need 
to be ready before 2.6 can be finally released (in which I agree, obviously).
And finally, some relevant system specs:
Distro: Gentoo
Kernel: 2.6.0-test6
X11: XFree86 4.3.99.12
Yours sincerely,
Simon Ask Ulsnes
