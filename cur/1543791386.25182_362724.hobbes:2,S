CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G does not enable PAE - it is CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G which
does it.  So the slowdown must be due to something other than PAE.
Please also show the start of dmesg output - lines which look like:
BIOS-provided physical RAM map:
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000000000 - 000000000009fc00 (usable)
 ...
xxxMB HIGHMEM available.
xxxMB LOWMEM available.
Also show the output of "cat /proc/mtrr".  Some systems have buggy MTRR
setup done by BIOS, which can lead to such slowness when using the full
amount of memory.  Such problems may be fixed by a BIOS upgrade, or
worked around by specifying the mem=... option to avoid using the memory
which is not covered by MTTRs (if the amount of such misconfigured
memory is not excessively large).
