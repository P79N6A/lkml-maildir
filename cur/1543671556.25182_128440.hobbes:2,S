apples? pears?
100% copy or "binary clone" of a software is illegal, thats correct.
Reimplementing the "ideas" behind a software is legal.
Otherweise there wouldn't be Bitkeeper. "100% original invention" is
impossibel today. At least for a "nontrivial" software. And i guess
Bitkeeper isn't "trivial" (-> it's more than a oneliner).

wants a "you asked for it, you got it" text editor -- complicated, 
cryptic, powerful, unforgiving, dangerous.
