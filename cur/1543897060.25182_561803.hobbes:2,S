You mean the undocumented, 100% ioctl one?  With one ioctl to write
interleaved sound, one for non-interleaved sound, in addition to
setting interleaved or not in the configuration?  I should check one

Or the "library"?  Don't get me started on this one.
I take your word about the fact that the kernel side is better.  The
userland side, not so much.
  OG.
