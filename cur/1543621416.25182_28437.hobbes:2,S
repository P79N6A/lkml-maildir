patch-2.5.4-dj2 is missing the file include/sound/version.h, which is
present in patch-2.5.5-pre1.  The ALSA drivers won't compile without
it.  Even though that file says:
/* include/version.h.  Generated automatically by configure.  */
#define CONFIG_SND_VERSION "0.9.0beta10"
it is not automatically generated by kbuild.  I assume the 'configure'
referred to in the comment is the shell script configure when ALSA is
a separate project.
Cheers, Wayne
