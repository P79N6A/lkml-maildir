I also had nearly the same problem when moving from FC5 kernel to a
stock vanilla kernel : FC5 is heavily relying on modules, and my vanilla
kernel was compiled with everything built-in and no modules. 
This is definitely changing the order in which drivers and disks are
discovered
and resulted in drives changing devices :
FC5               Vanilla
/dev/sda   <--->  /dev/sdb
/dev/sdb   <--->  /dev/sdc
/dev/sdc   <--->  /dev/sda
This is a real pain, though people will tell you that udev is supposed
to take care of this... My problem was just that I _don't_ want udev
on my machine...
So, check also this point...
Regards,
Paul
