Heh, looks like I flubbed the loop condition too. For some reason I
thought pid_list was headed at the leader instead of being headerless,
which upon a rereading I see now, so explaining my confusion there.
The semicolon-requiring bits don't appear to be used by any of the
other do { ... } while(...) -style iterators, so I won't press that.
This patch appears sound and stylistically good. Linus, please add:
