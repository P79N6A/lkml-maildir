We've put procedures in place. Its called *SOURCE CODE*. The NCR 5380 for
example is the most godawful pile of crud scsi controller on the planet. Its
old while good for its time nowdays is a joke. 
Because we have this *SOURCE CODE* stuff it still works in Linux 2.3.30pre6
and people have extended it to support other platforms.  So its extensible,
its adaptable
Its also *maintainable* which is the most important item of all. I can take a
bug report and look at the controller source and say "ok thats a driver bug".

Which you can package in with the build rules. They do dependancies. You can
do a compiler dependancy. Debian for example pacakages gcc 2.7.2.3 for the
same reasons you give.  Not a problem.

Feel free to take the source tree, build a binary only compatible environment
and distribute it. Just keep to the GPL terms and don't expect anyone in
the mainstream community to do anything with bug reports versus it but bounce
them to you

Vendors submit cards for testing to vendors. Certification is a vendor
issue.

And because they have *source code* they can fix them too. What good is
"it doesnt work, oh shit" to the X people.
