Sure. If a routine uses must_check yet its return value may be
safely ignored then that must_check is simply misplaced and should
be removed. It does not mean all must_checks are bad - each of them
isn't bad unless one can demonstrate it is.
Back to sysfs_create_bin_file() - if one can demonstrate a caller
can safely ignore the return value (which, it seems, is the
case), then exactly this very must_check should be removed.
