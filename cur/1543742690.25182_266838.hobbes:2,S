I stand corrected.  I am familiar with the bnetd case but I was not
aware that it had been decided.  However, I _do_ have a copy of
bnetd on my HDD that I do not distribute.  I use it to host a server
for my LAN parties on the basis that I can do whatever I want
(excepting distribution) with the stuff that I own (IE: the bits on the
CD.  If Vivendi feels like suing me because I have a copy of stuff
they never had copyright on in the first place which I may or may
not be using, then they can go ahead and call my lawyer.  The
bnetd staff may have been distributing stuff they aren't allowed
to due to license infringement, but I have a right to circumvent
my _own_ damn computer in any way I please.
Cheers,
