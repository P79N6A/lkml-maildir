Hmm, this is something people have reported a long time but we've never
been able to reproduce it. People have even reported it on UP machines
(maybe they were running with preempt?).
Rusty has been over the locking in conntrack a few times without finding
anything that could explain it.
Could you please apply the attached patch and give it a go and send the
results to netfilter-devel@lists.netfilter.org ?
(I hope it applies, was diffed against my quite patched kernel)

Never argue with an idiot. They drag you down to their level, then beat
you with experience.
