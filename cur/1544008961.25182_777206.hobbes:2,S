Ok, the ICH6 LPC side has something similar, but not the same. Just two 
ranges, and slightly less flexible wrt sizing.
And ICH8/9/10 seems to have the same thing as ICH7.
And looking at my own machine (ICH10) it actually appears like my ICH10 
setup has two of the magic IO ranges that it decodes, and only one of them 
is covered by the BIOS PnP tables.
They're both below 0x1000, though, so Linux shouldn't ever allocate 
anything on top of them. And that's the norm - when firmware sets up 
hidden magic system IO ranges, they do tend to be low IO ports.
But if some incompetent firmware person screws that up...
