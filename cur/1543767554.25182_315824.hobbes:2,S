Languages often have more than one way to express something, this is not 
different.
Early on there was some confusion about this from people writing new 
Kconfig entries (not just reading existing ones), but this was became a 
non-issue since it's documented now.

It is easier to spot! Is it a big help? I don't know, but I don't see any 
improvement in removing them.
Personally I'd rather leave it to the maintainers of these entries, if 
they don't like it, they can remove it. If this feature is one day not 
used anymore, I'll remove it.

Please stop this. There is no point in arguing whether this is good or bad 
for Aunt Tillie.
