So over all it takes half a second longer to detect the disk, but because everything waits on it,
it takes more than three seconds longer to resume.
Setting manage_start_stop to 0 fixes it and is good enough for me, I didn't notice anything bad yet
because of the unmanaged stop. Implementing background spin up will fix it too.

Not even after they receive a read command? Ugh.
