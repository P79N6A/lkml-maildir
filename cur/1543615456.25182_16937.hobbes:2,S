I know that the Agenda VR folks were working on XIP with their
Linux PDA.  That's for the VR MIPs chip.  Of course, that chip
is a dog and their implementation didn't help much.  (Aside:
IMHO, the whole Agenda PDA fiasco was using Linux as a way to
dump their load of crappy PDAs on technoids who'll snap up
anything that runs Linux.  So, please do this with your project.)
