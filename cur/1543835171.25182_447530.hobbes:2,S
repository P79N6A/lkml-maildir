the comment from Max Krasnyansky (the original author) I got was this:
  As far as I remember there was some upper level locking that ensured
  that protected registration stuff. But it's been awhile so I may be
  completely wrong.
And Masatake YAMATO mentioned:
  It seems that lock_kernel/unlock_kernel was used in sys_init_module.
  However, now it is gone.
I haven't looked at the new module loading code to verify if we really
need to protect our socket registration or not.
Regards
Marcel
