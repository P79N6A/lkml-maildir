I'm sure you didn't mean the URL to the tools is in the source of the  
tools, right?
So then, which other sources do you mean? "The Linux kernel", for example,  
is an awful lot of source. And in any case, why would you expect anyone  
(who probably hasn't heard that the i810 *has* a RNG) to look at it just  
to find out if possibly there was a tool that could be helpful for  
something?
What am I missing here? I hope I *am* missing something here ...
