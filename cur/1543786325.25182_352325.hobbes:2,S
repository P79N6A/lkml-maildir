A couple of things.
- The name of your note is terribly generic, so it seems a poor choice.
- Why do we need to capture the page size at the time of the
  crash?  Isn't the page size a compile time option?  Won't
  sys_getpagesize() get you this information before the crash?  
  Why do we need the kernels page size at all?
- Why do you avoid storing the current task on the other cpus?
- Can't we derive the current task from the existing register information
  already captured.  If not would a little extra debug information
  captured at compile time be better?
- You don't address the issue of architectural control registers.
  So you are going to need another note at some point. (Not 
  necessarily a bad thing).
