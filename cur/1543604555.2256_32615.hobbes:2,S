Have a userspace job which
1) sleeps in the kernel
2) when woken, delivers the data from the filesystem via ioctl to the driver
3) goes back to sleep
Have a driver which
1) wakes the user space job
2) receives the data via ioctl
3) reloads the card
The userspace job is started at boot and lives forever.
Its probably easiest to build the driver into the kernel.
