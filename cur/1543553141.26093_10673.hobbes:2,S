Hi
Searching through the archives I found this post on Tue, Sep 12, 2000 at

I'm wondering if anyone has found a solution for this: our mailserver is
exhibiting the same error message (although no mention of the eth0
interface, we do also use the eepro100):

To agree with Octave, this only appears to happen under load - over weekends
(our quiet periods) the syslog is nearly empty. In extremis it has been
necessary to reboot the machine by kicking the power button.
Any thoughts appreciated.
Running Redhat 6.2 (not my choice) on a single-processor PIII-650 with 128MB
RAM and 256MB swap. Load average is usually around the 0.3 mark. Kernel
(2.2.17) was compiled from source.
I'm not subscribed to the list, but I guess this is the only way to find an
answer - can you please copy me in on any replies. Thanks :0
