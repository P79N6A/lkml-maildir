Yes. This all appears to be a case of some unfortunate naming used
here. GFP_KERNEL (== GFP_that_can_sleep, as defined currently) clearly
*cannot* go with GFP_ATOMIC (== GFP_that_cannot_sleep, for atomic
contexts, which is why GFP_ATOMIC exists). But the way these are
defined presently means that their combination is *not* invalid
(although of dubious usability).
As a matter of style, the author there could've written (GFP_KERNEL |
__GFP_HIGH) instead, but I'm not sure how much sense that makes
because once we specify GFP_KERNEL, we essentially bring out the heavy
weaponry to *make* some free space for ourselves if it isn't there
already (and we're prepared to sleep when all that happens) -- so
where's the need left to scavenge into emergency pools anymore?
__GFP_HIGH only makes sense for poor atomic contexts for whom sleeping
(when we try_to_free other pages to satisfy our allocation request) is
not an option, which is precisely how things are presently.

What combinations make sense for a particular user must be left to him
and his usage context. So although (GFP_KERNEL | GFP_ATOMIC) does not
make sense in the way these are generally used (or were invented for),
but the combination *as defined presently* is not "invalid". I'm not
sure whether we really need to bother with putting in any checks in
__alloc_pages() -- this is only nonsensical usage at worst, not a bug.

Not necessarily. I haven't looked around that code you mentioned, but
the solution is pretty simple:
1. If you're in_atomic() context, that GFP_KERNEL is a BUG and *must*
be removed.
2. If not, that GFP_ATOMIC is redundant / nonsensical and *can* be removed.
