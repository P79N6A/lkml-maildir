Well, I had a failure rate of about 1 in 5-10 resumes originally.
See: 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11545
Then I found the 2 workarounds and *with those in place* I got almost 100% 
reliable resumes. Now I've removed those workarounds and with either the 
revert or your oneliner I still get 100% success.
From my PoV that is a very definite improvement: the machine now "feels" a 
hell of a lot more reliable for critical use.
So I _could_ reproduce it reliably given enough suspend/resume cycles.
But I guess this does support your suspicion that it may be a timing 
issue: if the timing happens to be right, the resume succeeds; if it's 
wrong I get a dead box.

I did try that at the beginning. That's how I ended up removing e1000e 
before suspend. See 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11545.
My next hint was that Matthew Garret, who has the same notebook, was 
surprised at my resume problems as he did not see them. So I did a 
comparison of our kernel configs and made some changes to mine. From
that I found that a very low value for SND_HDA_POWER_SAVE_DEFAULT (5) 
reduced the failure rate to practically zero.
At some point I tried keeping e1000e loaded for a bit, but that quickly 
gave me a failure again, so I starting removing it again during suspend.
So I did have some data, but as I got no response on my BR I had no idea 
where to go from there. I was really very happy to see Rafael's mail as 
his description almost exactly matched what I had been seeing.
I'd be happy to run with unpatched kernels for a while and do some more 
pm_traces, but only if someone is going to follow up and interpret the 
results for me or provide suggestions for targeted additional debugging.
Cheers,
FJP
