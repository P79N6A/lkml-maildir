Debugfs is a very natural name, but it will undoubtedly cause
confusion since we already have debugfs(8) in e2fsprogs.  One is a
filesystem, and the other is a user-mode command, so it's not a total
name collision, but it could cause some communication mixups.  
On the other hand, I couldn't think of a better name, so perhaps we
should just live with it.  I did want to point out the potential
problem now while there's still a chance to change it, though....
