This is qgit-1.3
With qgit you will be able to browse revisions history, view patch content
and changed files, graphically following different development branches.
FEATURES
 - View revisions, diffs, files history, files annotation, archive tree.
 - Commit changes visually cherry picking modified files.
 - Apply or format patch series from selected commits, drag and
   drop commits between two instances of qgit.
  - qgit implements a GUI for the most common StGIT commands like push/pop
   and apply/format patches. You can also create new patches or refresh
   current top one using the same semantics of git commit, i.e. cherry
   picking single modified files.
NEW IN THIS RELEASE
Main focus of this release is usability.
The big feature is the use of tabs instead of independent windows.
This change alone could be enough for a release. It's a big rewrite of UI
code to let browsing revisions and patches quicker and easier.
An whole set of key and mouse bindings has been introduced to support tab
navigation, see handbook (F1) for details.
Also changes in annotation/file viewer and StGIT integration.
Please note that you will need git 1.3.0 or newer.
