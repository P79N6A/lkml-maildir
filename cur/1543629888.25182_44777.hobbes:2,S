Subject: [RFC] Making capabilites useful with legacy apps
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/5/8/147

In attempt to make capabilites more useful before the filesytem support 
arrives, I would like to "wrap" non-capabilities aware apps.
For example:
# capwrap --user nobody --grp nobody --cap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE nc -l -p 80
The wrapper would look like:
1 prtctl(PR_SET_KEEPCAPS, 1)
2 setreuid(uid,uid)  
3 setregid(gid,gid)
4 desired_caps = cap_from_text(argv[caps])
5 capsetp(0,desired_caps)
6 execvp(argv[legacyapp])
This wrapper[1] (that would increase security) won't work with the current 
kernel though, because at step 6, all capabilities are cleared.
It looks like when a non uid 0 process execs, all capabilities are 
cleared.
The wrapper could also support chroot and setrlimit.
