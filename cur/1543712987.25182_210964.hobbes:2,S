I'm not against anal checks (except personally :), but I'm very much
with Andrea on this: rw_swap_page_sync is horrid, but does manage to
do a particular job.  The header page is great fun: sys_swapon and
mkswap read and write it by a totally different route, I shudder
(especially when it's a swapfile with blocksize less than pagesize).
It would be nice to make it more general and correct, but that's
not something you should get stuck on right now.
