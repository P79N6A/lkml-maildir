It isn't that easy.  The "Tamper-Proof Torx" screws on a vacuum cleaner 
or a toaster won't stop anybody from opening up the thing, I mean every 
little hardware store stocks those Torx bits.  But by using a slightly 
odd screw, the company can say "look, we'we done all we can to stop 
them, but the user bypassed our security device, and it's not our 
fault".  Apparently Intel and Atheros are trying to protect themselves 
in a similar way, they Open Source everything except for the regulatory 
daemon (Intel) or HAL object file (Atheros).  Why?  Because they belive 
that if they give away the sources to those parts they do the software 
equivalent of putting a normal Phillips screw in a home appliance. 
(Personally I think what they are doing is ridiculous, but apparently 
those companies' lawyers dont' agree).
It's of course possible to argue that normal users don't compile their 
own drivers, they use a driver from their distribution maker, and 
compiling a hacked driver which allows them to override the limits is 
just as hard as it is for a Windows user to replace the driver binary 
with a hacked binary which overrides the limits, so hiding the source 
really doesn't help.

Welcome to the modern world, companies spend so much money on protecting 
themselves against potential lawsuit that it is silly.
