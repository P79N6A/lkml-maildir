Hello,
any USB storage devices (like an external USB HDD) that I connect to
the USB PCI adaptor card fail to be 'recognized' correctly by the
kernel. The dmesg output looks like this:
usb 3-1: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 2
usb usb2: suspend_rh (auto-stop)
usb 3-1: ep0 maxpacket = 8
usb 3-1: khubd timed out on ep0in len=-8/18
usb 3-1: device descriptor read/all, error -110
usb 3-1: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 3
usb 3-1: khubd timed out on ep0in len=-8/64
usb 3-1: khubd timed out on ep0in len=-8/64
usb 3-1: khubd timed out on ep0in len=-8/64
usb 3-1: device descriptor read/64, error -110
usb 3-1: khubd timed out on ep0in len=-8/64
usb 3-1: khubd timed out on ep0in len=-8/64
usb 3-1: khubd timed out on ep0in len=-8/64
usb 3-1: device descriptor read/64, error -110
usb 3-1: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 4
I've also uploaded the complete dmesg output to:
http://v3ng34nce.org/dmesg_output.bz2
The computer where the problem appears is running kernel 2.6.18-rc5
now, after showing similar errors under the 'unstable' SMP Debian kernel
2.6.17-1-686.
Greets,
    Jan-Hendrik Zab
