Subject: [PATCH] USB Support for recent Casio Digital Still Cameras, linux-2.4.11
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Recent Casio QV digital still cameras (for example the QV 4000)
show up as 
VendorID: 0x07cf  ProductID: 0x1001  Revision: 10.00
So the following patch is necessary to make these devices working
with the USB storage driver. The patch is against linux-2.4.11,
but it should work with any kernel since 2.4.8-pre3.

+ * are not conformant  to the USB storage specification in two ways:
  * - They tell us they are using transport protocol CBI. In reality they
  *   are using transport protocol CB.
  * - They don't like the INQUIRY command. So we must handle this command
  *   of the SCSI layer ourselves.
