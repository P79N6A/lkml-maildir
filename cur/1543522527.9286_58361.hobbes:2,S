Their checks gave bogus answers :-( They are fixed now (AFAIK). Unfrtunatelly
perfect checks are not possible (there are always has chance that some weird
host can relay ORBS's checks with only few lines of body but will not relay
"normal" spam with more then few lines and so on). Now ORBS will wait for
message to come back to bot from you server before marking you as open-relay.
Even this policy is not perfect but it's as good as it can be.
