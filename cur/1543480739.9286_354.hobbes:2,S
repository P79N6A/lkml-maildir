I don't know if it is a typo but the maintainer of this piece of code
told me to add these debugging printk's to pc_keyb.c:
        if (status & KBD_STAT_OBF) {
+               printk("kbd status reg: 0x%02x\n", status);
                val = inb(KBD_DATA_REG);
+               printk("got 0x%02x from kbd data reg.\n", val);
                if (val == 0x5a && (status & KBD_STAT_MOUSE_OBF)) {
                        printk(KERN_INFO "Detected PS/2 Mouse Port.\n");
                        retval = 1;
                }
        }
I sent him the output of dmesg after booting with these printk's and
it looks like there is a problem in the detection logic. Can you try
thse printk and let us know what are the values of status and val?
