I suspected as much :/

sync just guarantees that metadata changes are logged and data is
on disk - it doesn't stop the filesystem from doing anything after
the sync...

Ok, so it's not an obvious XFS problem...

Ok.

Interesting. That means something in the generic remount code
is affecting this.

Ok, so a clean inode is sufficient to prevent hibernate from working.
So, what's different between a sync and a remount?
do_remount_sb() does:
    599         shrink_dcache_sb(sb);
    600         fsync_super(sb);
of which a sync does neither. sync does what fsync_super() does in
different sort of way, but does not call sync_blockdev() on each
block device. It looks like that is the two main differences between
sync and remount - remount trims the dentry cache and syncs the blockdev,
sync doesn't.

I suspect that the frozen filesystem might cause other problems
in the hibernate process. However, while a freeze calls sync_blockdev()
it does not trim the dentry cache.....
So, rather than a remount before hibernate, lets see if we can 
remove the dentries some other way to determine if removing excess
dentries/inodes from the caches makes a difference. Can you do:
# touch /huge/foo
# sync
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
# hibernate
# touch /huge/bar
# sync
# echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
# hibernate
# touch /huge/baz
# sync
# echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
# hibernate
And see if any of those survive the suspend/resume?
Cheers,
Dave.
