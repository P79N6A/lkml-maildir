	Can someone offer some insight on how complicated it would be to
patch the kernel in such a way as to add a (user defineable) delay to IP
forwarding?  I am trying to use linux to simulate the natural latency of
certain links (such as satelite links).  Normally this is done by using 
some sort of packet generator to increase the utilization of a network, 
but this is not a true simulation of this type of latency.
	I guess first of all, is there some way of doing this now with
existing software?  If not, I figure a quick peak in
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward_delay to determine the delay and then a
sleep() before the actual code that performs the forwarding ofthe packet
would suffice.  Would this be harder than it sounds?  Where in the source 
would be an appropriate place for the sleep() statement?
	Thanks!
	Chris
