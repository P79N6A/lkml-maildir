Subject: Network bug 2.2.*   - reboot linux every week?

People,
there is a bug in the tcp/ip stack in linux 2.2.*. I tried to track it
down,
but i never get a chance to analyze the bug, because all servers, that
show it are production servers (so i have to reboot it ).
My new policy is now to reboot linux every week. Sigh,  where is
the stable things that 2.2.* promises ?
* Environment (different network cards tulip(100MBIT),
eexpress(100MBIT), ne2000)
 - a webserver with virtual domains (redhat 5.2)
 - a server with netatalk (without virtual domains) redhat5.2
 - "normal" linux server  (redhat 5.2)
Bug spotted in 2.1.132, 2.2.3, 2.2.6, 2.2.9
No messages, no oops,  server runs fine when the network stack goes
crazy
(and you can do a shutdown -r now )
Symptoms:  Difficult to describe (Hanging/No Network
Connections/ Connection dropped)
    It looks like the server becomes selective which connection
    (tcp/udp) it accepts
    computer A can connect to server
    computer B cannot   (same eth0 device)
    Example 1: Some network connection from outside to the
    webserver worked, but the internal network could not
    connect to computer before reboot
      * all devices where up
      * no firewall
    (It was very strange,  i tried different providers and some worked
      and some others did not (traceroute showed that i could reach
      the network of our provider (which reported me our unwilling
      server - reboot - and everything worked )))
    Example 2: Hanging Network connection
    You can make a
    > telnet buggyhost 80
      GET /
    and it returns the webpage but never does a
    "Close Connection" (normal case)
    so telnet hangs forever( ok 10 minutes before i killed it)
    Example 3: Appletalk clients loose  connection to server,
    this actually shows some messages from appletalk, but
   says "connection to client lost" . Clients work ok for
   2 Years now.
Method to trigger the bug:
 * uptime > 20 Days
 * connect to the internet
 * and like yesterday setup a new virtual device
   ifconfig eth0:22 ... up
   and after 2 hours the server gets crazy
