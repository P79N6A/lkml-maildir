I've been testing 2.3.99 on some weirder hardware and hit an interesting
quirk. The 2.2.x kernel + pcmcia correctly finds an i82365 compatible
pcmcia controller in the Palmax PD1100. The 2.3.x kernel code cannot see
it and reports a failed probe.
The device itself is a Texas Instruments PCI cardbus bridge (104c/ac1e)
which shows up as a i82365 in 2.2.x
