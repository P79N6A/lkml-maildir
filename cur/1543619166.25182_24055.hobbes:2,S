Subject: Could not compile md/raid5.c and md/multipath.c in 2.5.3-pre3

Hello,
While compiling the clean 2.5.3-pre3 kernel I found the
drivers/md/raid5.c and drivers/md/multipatch.c could not get compiled.
Here is the compiling error for raid5.c: 
......
-D__KERNEL__ -I/home/ming/views/253-pre3/include -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer
-fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2
-march=i686    -c -o raid5.o raid5.c
In file included from raid5.c:23:
/home/ming/views/253-pre3/include/linux/raid/raid5.h:218: parse error
before `md_wait_queue_head_t'
/home/ming/views/253-pre3/include/linux/raid/raid5.h:218: warning: no
semicolon
at end of struct or union
/home/ming/views/253-pre3/include/linux/raid/raid5.h:222: parse error
before `device_lock'
......
This failure also happened for 2.5.2 kernel.  Both of raid5.c and
multipatch.c use some data structures defined in md_compatible.h, which
was included in md.h before but does not exist under include/linux/raid
for now.  Could someone fix this?
