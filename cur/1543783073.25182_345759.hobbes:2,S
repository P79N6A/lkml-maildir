	The way that configfs and sysfs create/destroy dentries and
their associated inodes is very different from the top, yet similar from
the bottom.  I suspect that some of it could be libraryized.  When I
first looked started configfs, I was starting from an "add on to sysfs"
perspective, after all.  The sysfs maintainers and I agreed, after much
discussion, that we should go to a separate tree.
