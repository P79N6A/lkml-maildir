argh, that sounds like an ACPI regression.

The fact that bisection broke really does make it hard.  What you would
need to do is to find the patch which fixed that doesn't-boot problem, then
reapply it each time you perform an iteration.  That's all doable, if you
have the time.  Use git-bisect for it.
Have you tested 2.6.21 and/or 2.6.22-rc1?
We had one other report earlier today that 2.6.22-rc1 does an immediate
resume after suspend-to-RAM - perhaps that is related.
Of course the alternative way of debugging this is just to debug it, rather
than the difficult bisecting.  Perhaps an ACPI developer can help with
that.
