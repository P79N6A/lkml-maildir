Subject: [PATCH] cleanup and remove some extra spinlocks from rtmutex
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Oleg brought up some interesting points about grabbing the pi_lock for
some protections. In this discussion, I realized that there are some
places that the pi_lock is being grabbed when it really wasn't
necessary.  Also this patch does a little bit of clean up.
This patch basically does three things:
1) renames the "boost" variable to "chain_walk".  Since it is used in
the debugging case when it isn't going to be boosted. It better
describes what the test is going to do if it succeeds.
2) moves get_task_struct to just before the unlocking of the wait_lock.
This removes duplicate code, and makes it a little easier to read.  The
owner wont go away while either the pi_lock or the wait_lock are held.
3) removes the pi_locking and owner blocked checking completely from the
debugging case.  This is because the grabbing the lock and doing the
check, then releasing the lock is just so full of races. It's just as
good to go ahead and call the pi_chain_walk function, since after
releasing the lock the owner can then block anyway, and we would have
missed that.  For the debug case, we really do want to do the chain walk
to test for deadlocks anyway.
