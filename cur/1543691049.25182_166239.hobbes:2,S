I find what is wrong
in fact the link "build" in directory /lib/modules/2.6.0-test5-mm2/ pointed to 
"."
so it can't work well ...
I make it point to the right directoryn abd now, nvnet compil without problem
Does someone have the same problem with this link with kernel test5-mm2 ?
I used Debian way (make-kpkg kernel-image) to compile it with clean sources 
which I take from kernel.org
