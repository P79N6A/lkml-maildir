That's good.  This is pretty much all I want =)

I did not realize that /proc/modules lied.  From a user standpoint, it may
not be /proc/modules lying, it may be module-init-tools lying to the kernel
about the module it just loaded.  I don't know, I have not looked at the
code for module-init-tools.  I checked one of my 2.6 machines and indeed all
modules are with an _ instead of a -
When I first noticed that [eou]hci_hcd was loaded I figured all modules were
using _ now.  When I was playing with alsa it never clicked in about the -
and _.  I see now that it's _ in /proc/modules.
[OT] why is the usb drivers named with -hcd at the end anyway?
