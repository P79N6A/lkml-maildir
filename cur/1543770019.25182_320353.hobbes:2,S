Hi Marcelo,
  Attached comes appropriate patch for 2.4
  Signed-off-by: Aleksey Gorelov <aleksey_gorelov@phoenix.com>
Previously posted patch for 2.6 had been verified by Karsten Keil
<kkeil@suse.de>.
According to the VIA 82C586B datasheet (still available from
http://gkernel.sourceforge.net/specs/via/586b.pdf.bz2
) this chip needs
a special PIRQ mapping. Again, according to appropriate datasheets, 
82C596, 82C686 & 8231 should continue utilize old scheme.
