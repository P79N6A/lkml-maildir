I would call that a "creative way to spin a mutex" .

"Empty" ? It handles the non-blocking code, event waiting, filp
setup. It's a affordable extra thin layer.

I bet the pltimer/plsignal compat code will be smaller/cleaner then
the timerfd/signalfd. Will post soon.

It's definitely not a copy.

its a matter of taste and i'm entitled to a bad one every once in a

Anyway, I didn't expect to move forward with your blessing but your comments
are appreciated.
Andrew, If you see fit, go ahead with signalfd. Anyway, i will cook up a
