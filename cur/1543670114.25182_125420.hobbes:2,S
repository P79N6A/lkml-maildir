Yes!  Thank you.  This patch fixes the segfault of modprobe that I've 
been seeing for ages.
Note that the problems I have been seeing are completely different from 
Geert's problems.  I have had no problems mounting a FAT-16 fs with the 
2.5.x kernels but modprobe has been segfaulting all along, even though 
the ppa module works fine for me once it has been loaded.
When I compile ppa into the kernel I see a kernel panic during bootup.
I will also try compiling your patch into the kernel and see if it
prevents the panic.
The parallel Zip drive is the only scsi device I have, so I can't 
comment on the more general situation.  This is the scsi section
of my kernel config:
