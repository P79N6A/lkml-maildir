Taking a quick look at the code, I think a race could happen like this:
Task A is executing a system call handler such as sys_setgid(),
sys_setuid(), etc. that assigns a value to the 'dumpable' field (i.e.
current->mm->dumpable = suid_dumpable; ).  At the same time the OOM
killer decides to shoot task A.  The following sequence of events could
take place:
    1.  Task A reads the machine word containing 'dumpable' into a
        register and modifies the value in the register so that
        'dumpable' is set to the desired value.
    2.  Task B, which is executing the OOM killer code, has decided to
        shoot task A.  B reads the machine word containing 'dumpable'
        into a register, sets the bit corresponding to 'oom_notify',
        and writes the machine word back to memory.
    3.  Task A writes its machine word back to memory, which wipes out
        the setting of the 'oom_notify' bit by task B.  Now the OOM
        kill operation will never terminate, and all future OOM kill
        operations will be prevented.
I guess it would be kind of nice if we had some sort of primitive for
atomically modifying multiple bits within a machine word.
Oh well :-/
