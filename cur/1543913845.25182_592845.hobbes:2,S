I'm not making any of these paths significantly more likely to occur
than they already are. Lots and lots of users run swap heavy loads day
in day out - they don't get funny systems (well sometimes they do, and
theoretically we can easily run out of the PF_MEMALLOC reserves -
HOWEVER in practise it seems to work quite reliably).
