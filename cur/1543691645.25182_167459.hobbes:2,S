I got the same results.  However it seems the bug is something to do with a 
directory listing cache somewhere.  If you sync after copying over the file 
the suid bit is shown as having been cleared.
$ touch suid_test
# chown root suid_test
# chmod 4775 suid_test
$ ls -l
total 0
-rwsrwxr-x    1 root     ianh            0 Sep 22 04:21 suid_test
$ cp /bin/ls suid_test
$ ls -l
total 68
-rwsrwxr-x    1 root     ianh        69228 Sep 22 04:22 suid_test
$ sync
$ ls -l
