I'm concerned that the major improvement has come from additional 
calls to schedule instead of from some basic improvements in algorithm.
Calls to schedule are not free and I'm not smart enough to see an
obvious way to add a rescehdule 
into a loop that dumps all write data to buffers without damaging
thoughput.  This seems like _another_  tunable parameter
          start io-loop
             do chunk
             io_reseched()
             end loop
io_resched
       if (really_want_soft_rt > resched count)
                schedule
