If you have 2 machines with FireWire ports - The kernel debugger that comes with Windows DDK is also very easy to use and quite useful for such things( at least that's what I found last time when I was having nausea from ndiswrapper :). 
Windows DDK is not downloadable for free  but it's very cheap to order a CD (~ 9USD IIRC).
