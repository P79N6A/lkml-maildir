In late 2.1.x, I tracked down some horrible nastiness with 8390 and SMP, 
which Alan rectified.  Our problem had to do with switching between page 0 
and page 1 in the 8390 and, among other things, destroying the multicast 
table.  But there were some other SMP-related issues with the 8390.

I wouldn't be suprised if even in 2.2.x/2.3.x various bad things happen 
with SMP and 8390-based cards.  It's an awful, awful chip when it comes to 
SMP operation, and it may need some more spinlocks to avoid yet another 
intermittent failure.
