How dare can you break my kernel, yeah... . We know that.
That my patches _fixed_ the kernel for thousands of people doesn't
matter. What matters is the one person for whom it broke. So let's
apply a questionable fix for it that we don't understand. Hopefully
that fixes it and doesn't break it again for somebody else... .
I provided an alternative fix. In my very first email.
Ingo, if you know that this fix is right, then please sign it off
so we can apply it.
