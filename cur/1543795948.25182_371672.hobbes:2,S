I would rather prefer NOT to introduce this at this time.
My primary concern is that during "even numbered series" there
should not be radical internal ABI/API changes, like this one.
In 2.7 it can be introduced, by all means.
Indeed at the moment my thinking is, that X86-64 is way more UNSTABLE,
than it should be.  (And Linux kernel overall, but that is another story.)
