And you expect your sysadmins to know LISP?  I would hardly think of 
LISP as any kind of simplification to anything.
I mean, I like the language and all, but it is in no way "simpler" than 
C and it's definately not appropriate for in-kernel stuff.

In theory, we could develop the kernel in a language that does all sorts 
of protection, garbage collection, run-time checking, etc.  Kernel 
developers choose not to because the performance hit would be HORRIBLE.
Now... that doesn't mean you can't do kernel-level stuff in LISP.  You 
just don't do it _in_ the kernel.  Given the absolutely MASSIVE overhead 
you're already incurring by using a LISP interpreter, having to 
context-switch into user space won't hurt in the least.  So, what you do 
is have a C-based stub in the kernel which passes stuff off to the 
user-space LISP daemon which calls back into the kernel for accessing 
devices, etc.
THAT would be a much better way of doing this.
