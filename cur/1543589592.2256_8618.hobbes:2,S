It is already being (ab)used this way. Its an isa pnp device in 2.4.*. Its
also a bios pnp device in 2.4-ac

Having thought over the issues I plan to maintain a 32bit dev_t kernel with
conventional mknod behaviour, even if Linus won't. One very interesting item
that Peter Anvin noted is that its not clear in POSIX that
	mknod /dev/ttyF00 c 100 100
	open("/dev/ttyF00/speed=9600,clocal");
is illegal. That may be a nice way to get much of the desired behaviour without
totally breaking compatibility
