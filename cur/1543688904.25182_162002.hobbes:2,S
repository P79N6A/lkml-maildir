There is an important difference.
If I send you a mail saying "X" and you change it to say "Y" and put "Y"
in the source tree, fine.  It was a mail between us, noone except you
and me will know.  If I think it's wrong, maybe I can make you submit
"X" to the source tree instead, with an explanation.
Everything that was ever publicly visible, stays publicly visible, even
with the the revised comments, thanks to the revision history.
But changing the source tree revision history retroactively, that's bad.
It defies the purpose of revision control itself.
The source tree is a public record. People will remember "this said 'Y'
I'm sure, but now it says 'X', why is that?" - and noone can answer.
History forgotten.
It's your call, but I can certainly see why some feel bad about this.
After all, we wouldn't want to edit the e-mail archives to remove all
trace of what happened, either, would we?   ;)
Cheers,
