Hi,
seems there is a race in drivers/net/usbnet.c in full RT mode. To be 
honest I haven't hardly checked this on the latest kernel and latest RT 
patch but just took a look at usbnet.c and latest RT patch and haven't 
observed any related changes.
The  usbnet_start_xmit() contains the following code:
	...
	spin_lock_irqsave (&dev->txq.lock, flags);
#ifdef	CONFIG_USB_NET1080
	if (info->flags & FLAG_FRAMING_NC) {
		header->packet_id = cpu_to_le16 ((u16)dev->dev_packet_id++);
		put_unaligned (header->packet_id, &trailer->packet_id);
#if 0
		devdbg (dev, "frame >tx h %d p %d id %d",
			header->hdr_len, header->packet_len,
			header->packet_id);
#endif
	}
#endif	/* CONFIG_USB_NET1080 */
	switch ((retval = usb_submit_urb (urb, GFP_ATOMIC))) {
	case -EPIPE:
		netif_stop_queue (net);
		defer_kevent (dev, EVENT_TX_HALT);
		break;
	default:
		devdbg (dev, "tx: submit urb err %d", retval);
		break;
	case 0:
		net->trans_start = jiffies;
		__skb_queue_tail (&dev->txq, skb);
		if (dev->txq.qlen >= TX_QLEN (dev))
			netif_stop_queue (net);
	}
	spin_unlock_irqrestore (&dev->txq.lock, flags);
	...
THe race in full RT is between tx_complete() routine and 
__skb_queue_tail (&dev->txq, skb): skb->list gets initialized in 
__skb_queue_tail() but may be dereferenced before initialization at 
defer_bh() called from tx_complete() (since tx_complete() and 
usbnet_start_xmit() are completely asynchronous routines).
in non-RT case spin_lock_irqsave (&dev->txq.lock, flags) disables 
interrupts and thus code from usb_submit_urb() call upto 
__skb_queue_tail (&dev->txq, skb) executes atomically. But in RT case 
interrupts are not disabled and usb_submit_urb() triggers an interrupt 
which may cause tx_complete() execution before __skb_queue_tail () call. 
And since skb->list gets initialized just at __skb_queue_tail(), call to 
tx_complete() (via defer_bh() which thus executes before 
__skb_queue_tail) dereferences NULL (skb->list) pointer.
Thus looks tx_complete() and usbnet_start_xmit() require a 
serialization. Please find proposed fix attached though not sure the 
patch will apply cleanly to the latest kernel.
