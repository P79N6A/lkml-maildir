There are two reasons why it can fail:
1: The bus doesn't support MWI.  Here, the caller doesn't care.
2: The bus _does_ support MWI, but the attempt to enable it failed. 
   Here we very much do care, because we're losing performance.

It's important to continue this discussion so that certain principles can
be set and agreed to.  Because we have a *lot* of unchecked errors in
there.  We would benefit from setting guidelines establishing
- Which sorts of errors should be handled in callers
- Which sorts of errors should be handled (ie: just reported) in callees
- Which sorts of errors should be handled in neither callers nor callees
  (are there any of these?)
- Whether is it ever legitimate for a caller to not check the return code
  from a callee which can return -EFOO.  (I suspect not - it probably
  indicates a misdesign in the callee, as in this case).
