'-rc3' fixed both long standing graphics bugs on an PowerMac 8500 with G3 
upgrade, which is a major improvement.  It corrects two bugs, one dating
back to 2.6.9-rc1 and the other, MUCH earlier than that, both affecting
framebuffer text consoles.  
I haven't run it long enough to judge stability, but so far so good.  
It has problems initializing a Gigafast WF741-UIC Wireless USB device.
But that device has had problems with vanilla i386 LINUX until 2.6.10-rc2
in any case.  So i'm not surprised or concerned that it doesn't work here
yet.  This is largely an FYI, as this hardware was purchased for a laptop
and was just put on the PPC for test purposes.
Thanks 'benh' (and whoever else worked on this), as this has been a long-
standing and frustration problem!
