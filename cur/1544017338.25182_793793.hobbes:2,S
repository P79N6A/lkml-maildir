We can revert it (and will revert it if no solution is found), but i'd 
also like to understand why it happens, because that kind of regression 
from this change is unexpected - we might be hiding some bug that could 
pop up under less debuggable circumstances, so we need to understand it 
while we have a chance.
Below is the commit in question. Avi, any ideas what makes KVM special 
here? Perhaps its use of "preempt notifiers" is causing a problem somehow?

Subject: [PATCH] sched: fine-tune SD_MC_INIT
Tune SD_MC_INIT the same way as SD_CPU_INIT:
unset SD_BALANCE_NEWIDLE, and set SD_WAKE_BALANCE.
This improves vmark by 5%:
