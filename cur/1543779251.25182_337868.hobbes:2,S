Well, you have bundled do_make_slave(), pnode_member_to_slave() and
empty_pnode() all into one function.  I think your original split is
quite nice.  If you'd split this function up like that, I think you'd
agree, that the end result is simpler.
Btw. though you don't have a pnode datastructure, that doesn't mean
you can't separate the shared subtree related functions into a
separate pnode.c (or whatever) file.  I think the do_make_* functions
also belong in there, not namespace.c.

I think you are bluring the distinction between two separate concepts:
"structure" and "function".
You can concentrate separate "structures" in a single object, without
having to mix the "functions".
The linux 'struct list' is a wonderful way to do this.
C++ inheritance is another (much less wonderful) way.
Mixing "functions" is bad.  Concentrating "structure" is good.

Well, but the pnode traversing is only part of the problem.  In the
end you really need to traverse vfsmounts.  Pnodes are really just a
conceptual helper.  I think Al Viro didn't make that clear enough in
his RFC.

I really don't want to force it on you.  If you feel comfortable with
the current code, that's OK.  But keep in mind, that this is a central
part of the kernel, and so the code needs to be understood to the last
little detail, not just by you.  And doing that with >1000 new lines
of code is not an easy task.
So the less code (and less complexity) you are able to make this
functionality work, the easier it will be for others to understand and
accept it.
