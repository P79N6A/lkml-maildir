unfortunately not, the files have been renamed and renaming them back I can't reproduce the magical effect they did before.
Now I will try to rescan for any kind of files with long names and see if with the option on and without the patch it will re-generate that kind of errors they gave me.
I must thank you a lot, maybe a bottle of wine will do it ;)
anyway I didn't get why some files will copy with the right case and other don't. Was it a problem with the dentry table randomly failing in saving the filename? the shortname option in the Docs isn't well accurate in explaining the meaning of "Windows X rule for display/create", I will investigate after having checked the 32 GB of files. thanks again.
