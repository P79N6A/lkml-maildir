Subject: How can I optimize a process on a NUMA architecture(x86-64 specifically)?

Say you have a bunch of single-threaded processes on a NUMA machine. 
Does the kernel make sure to prefer allocations using a certain CPU's 
memory, preferring to run a given process on the CPU which contains its 
memory?  Or should I use the NUMA API(libnuma) to spell this out to the 
kernel? Does the kernel do the right thing in this case?
Thanks,
Brett
