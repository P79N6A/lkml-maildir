   There has been some discussion about the slowness of the mailing
   lists on vger.  If people think this is really a problem, a
   reasonable answer might be to get N trusted machines, divide the
   list by N, and fan out the list to each of the machines to get some
   parallelism.
Actually, we do this fanout already by toplevel domain.
There is a slight problem, there are two highly problematic domains,
these are .org and .net  The problem is that there is no direct
geographic correspondance for them.
Later,
