Alan, that is _not_ the point here.
It's ok to tell the kernel these "long-term" policies. But it has to be 
told as a POLICY, not as a random number. Because I can show you a hundred 
other cases where the user mode code does _not_have_a_clue_.
That's my argument. The kernel should be given a _policy_, not a "this 
frequency". Because a frequency is provably not enough, and can be quite 
hurtful.
And I do not want to get people used to passing in frequencies, when I can 
absolutely _prove_ that it's the wrong thing for 99% of all uses.
