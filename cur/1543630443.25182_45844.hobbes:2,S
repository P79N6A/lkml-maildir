That's nice, but doesn't quite solve Keith's problem:

	Keeping up to date with kernel changes is a significant effort,
	Makefiles change all the time, especially when major subsystems like
	sound and usb are reorganised.  There are also some changes to
	architecture code to do it right under kbuild 2.5 and tracking those
	against kernel changes can be painful.
