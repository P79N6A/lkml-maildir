Well, gcc does not complain, and the problem is not "kernel is special" or "on 
some arch it's different". It's an alias for "ll" for both gcc and glibc; I 
checked, in fact, the version below of info pages for glibc:
This is Edition 0.10, last updated 2001-07-06, of `The GNU C Library
Reference Manual', for Version 2.3.x of the GNU C Library.
(I guess the "last update" is botched).
