Use TLB batching for MADV_FREE.  Adds another 10-15% extra performance
to the MySQL sysbench results on my quad core system.

With the attached patch to make MADV_FREE use tlb batching, not
only do we gain an additional 10-15% performance but Nick's
mmap_sem patch also shows the performance increase that we
expected to see.
It looks like the tlb flushes (and IPIs) from zap_pte_range()
could have been the problem.  They're gone now.
The second column from the right has Nick's patch and my own
two patches.  Performance with 16 threads is almost triple what
it used to be...

This is for another day. :)
First some ebizzy runs...
