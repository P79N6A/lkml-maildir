Many thanks for the report.  It looks from the messages at the end as
if this is a manifestation of my PageReserved "Bad page states" that
2.6.15-rc1-mm2 was particularly put out to check for.
Unfortunately your logging system is cutting out the most important info
(perhaps because that's marked KERN_EMERG and the stack trace is not):
I get lost in these logging setups myself so can't tell you what to do
to correct it: but maybe running "dmesg" will give the full output.
However, I've got four other reporters (though you're the first to
mention the mouse), and hope to be able to work it out from their info,
so don't worry if you can't track down the full Bad page state messages.
Thanks,
Hugh
