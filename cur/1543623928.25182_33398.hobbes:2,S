Hi
seems to work now
created a 1 Gib lv, formated it, extended with 2 Gib , extended the fs
and transfered about 1,5 Gib over it 
No troubles
thanks for the fix
:)
svetljo
and 
a stupid question
is there a way to limit the I/O request that XFS sends to the lower
layer ( soft RAID or lvm ) without need to modify existing fs 
just a hack until the raid-0 code in 2.5 is fixed
i'm talking about this:
> raid0_make_request bug: can't convert block across chunks or bigger
> than 16k 23610115 64
i posted already twice to lkml and linux-xfs
and i got answer that the raid is not ready but it's worked on
thanks
svetljo
