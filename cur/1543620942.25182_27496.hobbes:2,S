   back to my original question: what were the last trees with shrinking
   pools? would the original version still work or any redesigns needed?
Probably yes and it was the first 2.4.x that the pci_pool stuff
appeared in.  Peter Zaitcev disabled the shrinking in the next
release I believe, or soon thereafter.
