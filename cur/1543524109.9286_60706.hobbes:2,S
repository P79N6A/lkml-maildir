Hallo Manfred, Hallo linux-kernel,
I applied your patches and the call-trace showed
the following:
tony kernel: kmalloc: Size (33554432) too large
tony kernel: ca6e1f64 c024d820 02000000 ca6e0000 00000000 bffbf7c4 bffbf78c c014c0df

It happens every 100 msec when squid polls its fd's.
squid is compoiled to use 1024 filedescriptors. It's
just a local WWW cache for my machine.
Tell me if I should append some relevant parts of my System.map.
thanks in advance,
Patrick
