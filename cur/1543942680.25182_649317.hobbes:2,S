What we could do here is defined a new noinline_because_of_stack_suckiness
and use that.  Reasons:
- self-documenting, so we don't need to comment each site
- can be made a no-op for suitable __GNUC__ values if gcc ever fixes this
- our children we can go through and delete them all when nobody is using
  the offending gcc versions any more.
what thinkest thou?
