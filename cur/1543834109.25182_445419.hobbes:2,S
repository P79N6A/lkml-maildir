You seem to have this idea of everyone having some sacred right of
having their code either in the kernel or supported by the kernel
developers. That's fine, but last I checked, does not apply to Linux.
It is up to the maintainers to decide what's included and what's not.
We obviously don't want _everything_ in the kernel anyway and don't
want to stagnate the kernel development because of out-of-tree code
either. If you're unhappy about maintainer decisions, feel free to
complain to them or better yet, step up to do the necessary legwork to
get the code included. After all, that's how Linux development works.
