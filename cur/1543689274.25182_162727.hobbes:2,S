Sorry, 2.4.22 (from kernel.org) just hangs when I insert the card, after
the first of two beeps. Ctrl-Alt-Del doesn't work. No messages are
printed except the usual "cs: memory probe 0xa0000000-0xa0ffffff:
clean.", and syslog doesn't seem to have been flushed (it's cut off at
a higher position).
One thing I noticed from syslog is that the socket is assigned another
IRQ: 5 instead of 9.
