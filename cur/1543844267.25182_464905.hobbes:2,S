Absolutely - I was thinking that as a first cut, any subsystem (e.g.
cpusets, res_groups, etc) that wanted to use per-task containers could
declare what files it wanted a container dir populated with, so you
could have it looking just like cpusets if you wanted to, and mount it
on /dev/cpuset and use it exactly as before. If you then added the
res_group patch to your kernel, you would also get the appropriate
resource group files appearing in each directory, but the cpuset
support would work as before.
Longer term we'd probably want to figure out a better naming
partitioning scheme, or maybe just a convention that each directory
entry was prefixed with the subsystem name. Also, maybe have a
convention that control files and subcontainer names be in different
namespaces (e.g. all control files start with ".", all subcontainer
names start with something else).
