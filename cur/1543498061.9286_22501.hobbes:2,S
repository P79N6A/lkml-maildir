   Wait a minute. Are you talking about the userland server + normal
   NFS client combination? <scratching head> Hrrrmm... But READLINK in
   NFSv2 (and IIRC in v3 too) doesn't pass credentials, right? Could
   you elaborate on that?
This is a non-issue.  Alexander, if I understand your proposal
correctly, the hlfsd issue is solved by using an attribute timeout of
zero.  NFS must revalidate the inode on every access, so the symlink
cache validity is a by-product of inode revalidation.  See?
I'm doing some performance work on client side NFS right now, things
look extremely promising so far, and I'll post my results (in the form
of a patch against 2.3.x) when I have my first pass working.  In
essence:
1) All read operations into the client side NFS invoke _one_ copy and
   for the UDP case at least, the networking checksum is done in
   parallel with copies into the page cache for reads for instance.
   This is implemented using two things.  First the UDP checksum
   validation is deferred to happen outside of udp_rcv() processing,
   and in NFS's case it thus happens in the data_ready callback.
   Secondly, we defer linearization of fragmentated packets on
   receive, and the NFS data_ready code knows how to handle the
   fragment chains.  This is where we were getting killed on bulk read
   performance.
2) NFS dirent information lives in the page cache, no funny fixed size
   cache with funny invalidation semantics, truncate_inode_pages does
   it all, and thus NFS inode revalidation hands the grot of keeping
   dirent information from going stale as it does for all other
   attributes already.
   As a nice bonus this means the direct single copy overhead obtained
   in #1 happens for dirent information too.
What you see on the wire for #2 is just an inode getattr for a dirent,
in the worst case (the attribute timeout was hit).  Right now if you
obtain a working set of more than 64 directories, the network gets
flooded with RPC requests because of our fixed NFS dirent cache size
(actually it's less than 64 because those cache entries can each hold
less than the full contents of a directory if the dirent information
exceeds rsize).
