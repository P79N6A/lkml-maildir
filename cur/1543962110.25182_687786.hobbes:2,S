It's not that clear-cut, either. Something which manifests itself as a
build failure or an immediate test failure on m68k alone, might actually
turn out to cause subtle data corruption on other platforms.
You can't always know that it isn't important, just because it only
shows up in some esoteric circumstances. You only really know how
important it was _after_ you've fixed it.
That obviously doesn't help us to prioritise.
