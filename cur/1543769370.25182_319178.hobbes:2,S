I don't think loop on xip is performance critical. For page cache lookup
I see a performance difference of factor 2 on our platform because we
have decent memory bandwidth and lock contention slows things down
with many CPUs. Given that even without this patch we don't do page
cache lookups, I don't think there's much difference. Initially this patch
was written for the old loop driver that won't work without this patch...
Guess that dropping it is a good idea.
