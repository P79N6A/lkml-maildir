The function prototype for the switch handler is set in concrete by the 
notification framework.  The parameters are: struct notifier_block *, 
unsigned long, void *.

I think this would be nice to have, and I will look into it as I have 
time.  However, for the existing usage of the SPU switch notification, I 
don't think it's too critical, since most users are not going to be 
trying to do profiling or debugging with multiple SPU apps running 
simultaneously.
