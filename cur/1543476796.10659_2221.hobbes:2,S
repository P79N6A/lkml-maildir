I use the Aptiva CA keyboard, I prefered my CF keyboard but it died
and I live a long way from Québec. It seems just as cold though
(-20C tonight)
This one uses the 850 and 863 codepages under OS/2
I compiled both into the kernel to get support for it. Since I
added modutils-2.1.121.i386.rpm I can no longer load modules either
in the 2.0.36 or this kernel. I couldn't at all under the newer kernels
before so it now the same across the board. Joke aside, it gives
me :undefined symbol : __bzero in depmod and insmod
This rpm program is buggy as was util-linux-2.9-5.i386.rpm which I had
to reinstall RedHat after upgrading to it. At least this one wasn't
as destructive. I learned that you don't override rpm's about
a library even when you know that you have it when it is a vital
part of the system. I still haven't figured that one out. All I know
is that the system was dead on reboot, it kept asking for the login,
a dead system. Live and learn ...
To get back to the original problem, I got it fixed with a patch
that I found on an Italian newsgroup. I looked for hours, it's lucky
that I can read Italian.
I would like to thank Davide Manzoni for the idea.
The patch is this one in case someone has the same problem
(which I put in /etc/profile)
UNIMAP=iso01.uni
export UNIMAP
Davide uses cp437.uni but I don't
It works with iso01.uni. Youpi!!
As I saw in the kernel source it defaults to some crappy anglo
codepage if it doesn't find it's environment variable.
Now if I could get modules to load ...
