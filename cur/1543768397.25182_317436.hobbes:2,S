Are you sure?
The way it's supposed to work is that the do_munmap(,,old_len) which
follows, which normally unmaps the area moved from, when unsuccessful
unmaps the area moved to: which will "mistakenly" decrement total_vm etc.
by old_len, which needs to be bumped back up by that amount before leaving.
