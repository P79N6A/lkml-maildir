I just completed my own set of benchmarks using the fio job file
Mathieu provided. This was on a 2.5 inch 7200 RPM SATA partition
formatted as ext3. As you can see, I tested all of the available
schedulers with both queuing enabled and disabled. I'll test the Jens'
patch soon. Would a blktrace of the fio run help? Let me know if
there's any other benchmarking or profiling that could be done.
Thanks,
