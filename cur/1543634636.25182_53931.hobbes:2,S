Yikes, 4 bytes?  Is there any special considerations bumping up the to
the maximum for an iSCSI Initiator SCSI port name of 264 bytes?

Agreed.

Now this would be interesting,  although I am not sure how useful
this would be if the user cannot see the entire iSCSI network or if this
would not be better left to userspace.  But of course that is out of the
scope of driverfs.

What does the ":" <num> represent?  Would not each <WWUI> directory
contain the devices which are currently in use from that iSCSI target
node?
