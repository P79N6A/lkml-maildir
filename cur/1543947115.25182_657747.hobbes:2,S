Which it is on real hardware, because although it's not *reserved* (type 
2), it is certainly not made available as *normal memory* (type 1).  If 
Xen maps this as type 1 then I definitely see the problem.
We can exclude type 1 memory from DMI scan, certainly.
However, Xen may want to consider why provide memory below the 1 MB 
point at all, and certainly whether it's wise to provide RAM in the 
640-1024 KB legacy region -- although you could argue that "it *should* 
work", odds are pretty good you'll have nasty surprises on a regular basis.
