Subject: 2.5.43 IO-APIC bug and spinlock deadlock

IO-APIC bug: regular kernel, UP, no IO-APIC or APIC on UP enabled, compile
fails (does *everyone* run SMP or at least UP + APIC now?)
spinlock deadlock: run an smp kernel on a up machine.  On mine here all I 
have to do is try to boot to multiuser mode, it won't make it through the 
startup scripts before it locks up by trying to reenter common_interrupt 
on the only CPU.  Seems like an SMP kernel on UP hardware doesn't disable 
interrupts properly maybe?  I get task lists via alt-sysreq when the 
machine should be hardlocked I think.  Anyway, this is what has been 
tricking me into thinking I had an IDE problem.  IDE is innocent, it's the 
core interrupt handling code.
Back to work on scsi stuff now that I have a decently running 2.5.43
system, I'll let someone else deal with these.
