But wouldn't the same concept apply to non-module symbols that
are tagged with EXPORT_SYMBOL()?
Maybe I'm just showing my ignorance about kernel linking here...

Yes. we already have code like this in the kernel.
e.g. superio support in drivers/parisc.

I was thinking of "A is present and calls into module B, therefore B needs
to init first". In this case, A won't care if B is really present or not.
A depends on B to figure that out at runtime. If B is not configured into
the kernel, A won't ever call B since the "function" will be a NOP.
(e.g. #ifndef CONFIG_B/#define b_service() /* NOP */ /#endif)

I guess I was wondering if the kernel link step could use symbol information
in a similar way the kernel module autoloader uses depmod info. But other
parts of the kernel might not be as modular as most of the IO subsystems
are.
I'm not looking for ways to make the process more complicated for
the people maintaining code. Keeping the registrations of dependencies
up-to-date manually would just be another PITA.

Hey! I resemble that remark! ;)
(yeah, I've been a victim of that problem way too many times.)
