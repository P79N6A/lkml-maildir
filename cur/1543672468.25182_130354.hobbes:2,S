I run drivers with a separate kernel page table, that write-protects
memory not in use by the driver. In addition, I verify that parameters
passed from a driver to the kernel are valid, so the kernel doesn't die
while dereferencing a pointer.

What are you planning to do about protecting a buggy module/driver from
causing a crash by stomping on somebody *elses* memory and corrupting
some unrelated data structure?
