Yep. I've looked at that too.

A word of caution on this. I played around with ENBD (as well as some
others) about 6 months ago. I also did some performance testing with
the different drivers and user-level utilities. What I found was that
ENBD achieved only about 1/3 ~ 1/4 the throughput of NBD (even with
multiple replication paths and various block sizes). YMMV.
I also looked at DRBD, which performed pretty well (comparable to NBD).

Yeah. I wish I had the time to develop/maintain a network block 
device driver myself...but unfortunately I don't... :/
