Hmmm...  I'm not.  I'll whip up a patch for this.

Yeah.  It used to have something that slept in the middle of it, but that's no
longer there.  I'll add to the patch.

Okay.  I'll have a look at it once it's there.

:-)
The assertions I've put in have been very useful.

Not in this case, I assume, because set_page_dirty() ultimately calls
__mark_inode_dirty(), but I could be wrong.

I can call it invalidation if you like, though that name is already reserved
as it were:-/  I suppose it might actually make sense for me to call
invalidatepage() myself.

I'm not entirely sure.  Looking at generic_writepages(), I guess so.  I'll
patch it out.

Yeah.  Seems so.  I'll patch that out too.
What I'd like to do is ditch writepage() entirely - I'm not sure it's entirely
necessary with the availability of writepages() - but I'll look at that
another time.

Okay.
Thanks for the 'cherry-pick'.  I'll hopefully have a revision patch for you
soon.
