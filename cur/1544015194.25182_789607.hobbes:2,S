timec.c works with some minor modifications.  I'll post my version in
a separate message.  The main difference is that syscall() on powerpc
returns -1 on error and sets errno, rather than returning a negative
error number.  I also added a way to specify raw events.
I haven't looked in detail at kerneltop.c yet.  I have done a small
test program that exercises interrupt counters though.

Actually, I have discovered some bugs, so I'll need to do new versions
of 7/9 and 8/9.  I'll let you know when I have redone the git tree.
Paul.
