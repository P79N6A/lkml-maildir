Indeed, I don't think there should be any discussion at all about this,
since it helps users of our currently still external driver
(not too much longer external, I guess and hope) a lot.
Given that we don't have a stable driver ABI (for way too often discussed
very valid and sane reasons) I really, really think we shouldn't shoot
our foot into pieces by then additionally also bitching about *MINIMAL*
amounts of compatibility code required to keep up with those speedily changing
kernel requirements while our driver isn't included yet.
In the future, I'd like to ask people to be a *bit* more tolerant of newish
compatibility cruft. It's not like we're supporting kernel 2.2.x here still,
our driver is at 2.6.10 at a minimum(!), yet you still want to remove even
those few pieces!
This is simply ridiculous (again, as long as our driver isn't merged, which it
should be soon to improve maintenance).
OK, ending this rather fruitless discussion here. I better get back to hacking,
that's more productive.
