It would be more like not telling you how to change the egg yolk while
still having a working egg.  Only the egg shell guy knows how to put a
new egg yolk inside the shell and close the shell around it.  He isn't
going to say you can't break the shell, just that it you break the shell
the egg isn't going to work as a whole egg anymore, and he won't tell
you how to put it back together with a different yolk inside.  You can
still put the yolk inside another container that you do know how to
assemble around the egg stuff.

Very bad comparison.

What if I want to run a program that takes 512MB ram and the hardware
guys put in 128MB.  Now they are impeding me doing the change I wanted
to do to the software.

Not putting in an infinite amount of resources is impeding the user too.
"artificially burdening" seems very hard to define.  When something is
hard to define, you are usually better of not trying because you will
get it wrong and screw up even worse as a result.
