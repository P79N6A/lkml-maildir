Not at all. But there is also seems to be some people also experiencing
problems with basic page reclaim on some of the workloads where these
things help. I am not dismissing anybody's claims about anything; I want
to try to solve some of these problems.
Interestingly, some of the people ranting the most about how the VM sucks
are the ones helping least in solving these basic problems.

Well I never said real world tests aren't acceptable, they are. There is
a difference between an "it feels better for me", and some actual real
measurement and analysis of said workload.
And constructed test cases of course are useful as well, I didn't say
they weren't. I don't know what you mean by "acceptable", but you should
read my last paragraph again.
