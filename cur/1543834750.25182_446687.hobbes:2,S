My primary concern is my skill level.  I normally work in the kernel, and I'm
not too familiar with glibc, and completely unfamiliar with vdso
implementations.  I'm interested to do it, but I have no idea how long it will
take to understand vsyscall implementations, code one up, and get it right.  If
you think a month is sufficient, I'll take your word for it, but I'm starting
from zero in this area.
