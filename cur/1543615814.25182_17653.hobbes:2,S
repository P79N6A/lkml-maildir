The ~800MB or so of kernel address space is exhausted with struct page 
entries around 48GB of physical memory or so
SGI's original highmem patch switched page tables on entry to kernel 
space, so there is code already tested that we can borrow.  But I'm 
not sure if it's worth it as the overhead it adds makes life really 
suck: we would lose the ability to use global pages, as well as always 
encounter tlb misses on the kernel<->userspace transition.  PAE shows 
up as a 5% performance loss on normal loads, and this would make it 
worse.  We're probably better off implementing PSE.  Of course, making 
these kinds of choices is hard without actual statistics of the 
usage patterns we're targetting.

That would be neat.
