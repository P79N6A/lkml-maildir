     Thank you, I applied this to an otherwise stock 2.2.13 kernel and got one
error:

     Patch is looking for:
        if (down_interruptible(&inode->i_atomic_write)) {
     But actual code is:
        if (down_interruptible(&tty->atomic_write)) {
     I added the conditional_schedual() before this line by hand, but thought
you, and anybody else trying to apply this patch, might like to know about
this.  Thanks!
