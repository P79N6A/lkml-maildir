I installed 2.6.0-test1 this afternoon, and was quite pleased that it
could burn some cd's without the trouble I'd had with ide-scsi.
So I know 2.6.0-test1 works for me. But 2.6.0-test2 with the same
configuration (just a "make oldconfig" in between) stops during boot
with:
VFS: Cannot open root device "NULL" or sda1
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel panic: Unable to mount root fs on sda1
I have LILO on /dev/hda, and the root fs on /dev/sda1.  Adding a
"root=/dev/sda1" at the LILO: prompt doesn't change anything.
Henrik
