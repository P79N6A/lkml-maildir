No it should find it as soon as you load the module. If the device is
not the primary IDE controller (hda-hdd) you can set CONFIG_IDE = y,
include drivers for your other controller and get some debug info.
Usually "it didnt initialize" reports are from people with mixed old/new
IDE in their kernel or initrd, or initrds missing the required modules.
Stick a printk in pdc_init before the pci_register_driver call and
you'll know for sure if the module is getting loaded. If it is then send
me an lspci and I'll have a deeper look
