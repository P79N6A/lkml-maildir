This may be a fault in the gdth driver (if that's where the trace came
from).  It sets unchecked_isa_dma to 1 in its template and then resets
it at various places in the driver it may have been reset too late to
prevent it from getting the GFP_DMA scsi command pool.

Yes, I've checked this out in SCSI by artificially simulating a memory
allocation failure in scsi_get_command().  My system behaves nicely even
as I rack up the failures.  Is there anything else unusual in the log
that may indicate what the problem is?
