Hardware RAID can be (!= is) more tolerant of serious drive failures
where a single drive locks up the bus. A high-end hardware RAID card 
may be designed with independent controllers so a single drive failure
cannot take other spindles down with it. The same can be accomplished 
with sw RAID of course if the builder is careful to use multiple PCI 
cards, etc. Sw RAID over your motherboard's onboard controllers leaves
you vulnerable.
