Subject: [PATCH 0/13] Chaining sg lists for bio IO commands v3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
Third version of the patchset. Changes since v2:
- Get rid of ->next and use the ->page field as a next pointer.
  This saves some space in the scatterlist structure, at the cost
  of one extra sg segment per chained list. Should definitely be
  a space win.
- Cleanup linux/scatterlist.h, most of the stuff is outside
  the ARCH_HAS_SG_CHAIN ifdef now.
- Convert the x86-64 iommu code, enable it on x86-64.
- Convert all (hopefully) SCSI drivers to use the sg helpers so
  chaining can be supported globally. I collated all the SCSI
  driver patches into the 13/13 patch, as not to post a huge
  patch series. I would much appreciate some eye balls on this part,
  catching any dumb mistakes I may have made. The changes are usually
  trivial, but some are not and I do clown around occasionally :-)
Like v2, you still need to enable large commands manually for a
device, ala:
# cd /sys/block/sda/queue
# echo 1024 > max_segments
# cat max_hw_sectors_kb > max_sectors_kb
which would limit you to 1024 segments (effectively 8 scatterlists
chained), and should give you IO's of at least 4mb. You can go larger
than 1024, there's no real limit.
