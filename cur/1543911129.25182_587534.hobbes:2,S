I traced the pci_alloc_consistent calls from PrimeIocFifos on my
system.  There are two calls for each ioc.  The first is for
266368 bytes, the second for 16320 bytes.
I wonder why Kamalesh's system wants the slightly different
amount (263200 bytes) from what my system asks for?
It also looks to be a little unfriendly to swiotlb to ask for
more than 256K at a time (see IO_TLB_SEGSIZE) in swiotlb.c
