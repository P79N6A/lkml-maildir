FYI, the same problem occurs in 2.6.16-rt12.  I note that rt14 is out now
so I'll give that a go overnight and let you know the results.
One final observation I did make under 2.6.16-rt12: in the first 30 seconds
or there abouts after the boot, "sleep 1" did result in short sleeps - they
weren't always 1 second, but they were in the ballpark.  After the machine
had been up for 30-60 seconds however, "sleep 1" would produce waits along
the lines of what I reported in the initial report - anywhere between 20
seconds to 45 seconds and more.  There didn't seem to be any gradual
increase either - the "sleep 1" wait times seemed to jump from 1-2 seconds
up to 20-30 seconds very suddenly.
