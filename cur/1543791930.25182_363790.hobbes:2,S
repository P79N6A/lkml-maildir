For a _user_, it is the best choice to use the kernel provided by the 
distribution.
There _are_ incompatible changes between 2.6 kernels, and if you e.g. 
try to run kernel 2.6.14 on a Debian stable that ships only 2.6.8 you 
can always run into problems here or there.
And it seems we already have many big guinea pigs running the 
development branch of Fedora.
