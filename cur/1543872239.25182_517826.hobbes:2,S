Please, could you now rethink plugable scheduler as well? Even if one 
had to be chosen at boot time and couldn't be change thereafter, it 
would still allow a few new thoughts to be included.

I confess that the default scheduler works for me most of the time, i/o 
tuning is more productive. I want tot test with kvm load, but 
2.6.21-rc3-git3 doesn't want to run kvm at all, I'm looking to see what 
I broke, since nbd doesn't work, either.
I'm collecting OOPS now, will forward when I have a few more.
