So people should have started working on it sooner.  If people really think
they need a 32bit dev_t for their $BIGNUM of disks (and I still don't buy
that argument) we should just introduce it and use it only for block devices
(which already are fixed up for this) and stay with the old 8+8 split for
character devices.  Note that Linux is about doing stuff right, not fast.
