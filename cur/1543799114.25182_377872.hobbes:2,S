I might get to it after the New Year.

I can give you the answer to that now: use the existing stack overflow
detection.
This is not intended to be an automatic scheme. To use it, you must
actually insert code into the troublesome codepaths, which will of
course serve as a red flag for code review.
It's entirely possible that this idea won't be needed on x86 because
we can manage to squeeze everything into 4k. But 32-bit x86's days as
the majority platform are numbered.
