    You didn't address the first half. Why do the buffers() and 
nobuffers() act differently when calling cpuset_update_dirty_nodes()?

    Something weird with Firefox, but instead of jumping on me did you 
consider double checking your patches? I just went back, found the text 
versions, and the spaces are still there.e.g.:
+  	unsigned long dirtyable_memory;

    Exactly -- your patch should be consistent and do it the same way as 
whatever your patch is built against. Your patch is built against a 
kernel that subtracts off highmem. "Do it..." are you handing off the 
patch and are done with it?

    Again it sounds like you're handing them off. I'm not objecting I 
just hadn't understood that.
