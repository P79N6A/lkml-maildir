I fail to see why do you want to interpret LUNs?  If you want
to be "future-proof", SCSI Core should use it transparently,
a la, memcpy().
If you want to print it you can use "%016llx", be64_to_cpu(*(u64 *)...),
just like WWN.  _That_ will have a meaning to the application client/user,
but SCSI Core should treat it as a transparent token.

Why do you care about any of this if you support 64 bit luns?
