Good grief.  This is messy as hell, and really interferes rather badly
with the whole kernel.org mirror setup.
I guess the "best" solution is to use LVM atomic snapshots, and only
allow rsync off the atomic snapshot.  That way any particular rsync
session would always be consistent.  That's a *HUGE* amount of work,
though, and still doesn't solve the mirrors issue -- I don't control
what the mirrors run.  On the other hand, I don't know how many mirror
sites actually mirror /pub/scm since it's not a requirement.
