Albert, suppose there was an area where you were well versed.  Suppose
that you knew that it was a fruitless area of research.  Wouldn't you
feel some obligation to steer new people away from that area?  Or would
you just laugh up your sleeve?

How about a little truth in advertising, eh?  I'm not a huge fan of Suns
these days but you are painting an extremely misleading picture.
    		SMP		Cluster
bandwidth	~1GB/sec	~.01GB/sec
latency		~200ns		~150,000ns if using messages,
				~2,000,000ns if using DSM
It's very common in clusters to spend as much on the interconnect as all
the hardware and software put together.  So double your costs and you 
still have lower bandwidth and dramatically higher latency.

Generally my ass.  Try "always".
Albert, this stuff is all old hat.  SGI has done tons of work in this
area and it all turned out to be basically a waste - the Origin SMP
hardware completely smoked any sort of DSM that people did - even when
both were using the same interconnect.

: No.

I'm sure it was very important for the entire kernel list to know that you
can't tell us.  Can you tell us other things you can't tell us?
