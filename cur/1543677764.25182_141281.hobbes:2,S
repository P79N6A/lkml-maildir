Where exactly is that happening?

It's taking the ID from the system device of the node that's passed to 
->show(). That is set in register_node(), so I'm not sure how they could 
get out of sync, unless I'm missing something obvious. 
BTW, I did request that the NUMA topology people take a look at these 
patches when I sent them a couple of weeks ago, so as to avoid this. :)
