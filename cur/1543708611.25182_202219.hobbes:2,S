Are you checking the return value of write()?
O_DIRECT has alignment requirements since it writes directly from
user-space to disk by passing the page cache.  Also the size
of the write has to be a multiple of 512 (for 2.6).
Try using posix_memalign() with pagesize as the alignment arg
to allocated the data buffer.  O_DIRECT does work on ext3.
