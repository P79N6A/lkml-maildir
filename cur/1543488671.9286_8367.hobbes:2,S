Sorry, I was wrong in my previous mail. Of course I use mmap() to access
the IO memory space for the board. I want a portable, provided by Linux
libraries equivalent of
((*(volatile unsigned char *) ( base )) = ( v )) ;
before 2.1.3 that was asm/io.h that defined writel(v,base) as such.
Then the #ifdef __KERNEL__ was put around them.
I'm generally speaking amazed - does it mean that nobody wrote any user
(superuser) space I/O code in a clean way since 2.1.3 (which was 1996
BTW)?
