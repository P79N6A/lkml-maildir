   What did you modify? Previously, it said:
-----
HPT366: onboard version of chipset, pin1=1 pin2=2
HPT366: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 98
HPT366: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide2: BM-DMA at 0xb800-0xb807, BIOS settings: hde:DMA, hdf:pio
    ^^^^
HPT366: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 99
HPT366: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide3: BM-DMA at 0xc400-0xc407, BIOS settings: hdg:pio, hdh:pio
    ^^^^
hde: ST328040A, ATA DISK drive
ide2 at 0xb000-0xb007,0xb402 on irq 15

   Perhaps you could do a cat /proc/ioports so we can see how much has been
configured already? Perhaps also grep -F -e '' /proc/ide/hd?/model.
