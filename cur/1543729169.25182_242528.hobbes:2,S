 Unfortunately these events seem to be triggerable for all systems using
serial APIC interrupt delivery.  All that is needed is a sufficiently high
load on interrupts, even a transient one.  Admittedly the definition of
"sufficient" here is very high, something like at least ten thousands of
interrupts per second.  E.g. I've been able to observe a few of them on my
system when a UDP NFS client was untarring an archive over a 100Mbps
network -- both the archive and the destination were located in an NFS
mounted filesystem and the size of the untarred data was around 300MB.  
The APIC hardware is rock-solid there -- after many years of operation I
have yet to see a single APIC error.
 One "reliable" way of triggering these events is configuring the PIT
timer interrupt input as level-triggered in the I/O APIC. ;-)  This is
actually how I did run-time testing of this code.
