Interrupt handlers are easy.  Just switch irqreturn_t from into to
struct {int x;}, adjust the rest of irqreturn.h accordingly, add
extern void want_irqreturn_t(irqreturn_t);
then replace 0 ? (f)(x) : (void)0 with want_irqreturn_t((f)(x)) in the
expression under sizeof and we are all set (assuming Jeff's elimination
of irq number in place by then or done in parallel).
