If you set the latency only within 0 and 32 then numerous other cards will
stop working (because they set the latency up to fix pci bugs or get
performance) - eg the buslogic scsi cards set the latency in their bios. The
3c59x needs a high value.
The values they quote are ones people tried and they were pulled because those
were the values that generated all the 'my tv card has broken' 'my ethernet
stopped working' reports.
