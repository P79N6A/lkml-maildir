I'm getting the errors that others are seeing building linux-2.3.21
  bbootsect.s:687: Error: base/index register must be 32 bit register
with 
  GNU assembler version 2.7 (i486-linux), using BFD version 2.7.0.3
and after installing the Minimal Requirements from linux/Documentation/Changes
- Binutils               2.8.1.0.23              ; ld -v
 .... 
  Either use binutils-2.8.1.0.23 or binutils-2.9.1.0.7 or later.
 ...
So I found a copy of 
  binutils-2.8.1.0.23.bin.tar.gz
and installed it.
I'm still getting the errors 
dd:boot# as -version
