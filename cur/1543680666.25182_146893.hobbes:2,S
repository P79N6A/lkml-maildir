I am sure Linus and Andrew will continue to take patches to tune the
scheduler, as long as they are clearly tuning issues.
I do not see it as a _huge_ problem, because we are just worrying about
corner cases now. Worst case we can turn off the interactivity estimator
- which is both the root of the improvement and the problems - and be
back to where we are in 2.4.
