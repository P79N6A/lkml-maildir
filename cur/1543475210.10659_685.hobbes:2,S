The menuconfig help screen for processor selection is certainly a
LOT better than what was in past kernels, however there is an
inconsistency in what one should choose for an AMD K5/K6/K6-2/K6-3
processor.
The menu that you choose your processor on shows:
586/K5/5x86/6x86
Pentium/TSC
PPro/K6/6x86MX
While the help screen indicates:
- "Pentium" for the Intel Pentium/Pentium MMX, AMD K5, K6 and K6-3D.
  This option will assume that you have a time stamp counter.
- "PPro" for the Cyrix/IBM/National Semiconductor 6x86MX, MII and      
  Intel Pentium II/Pentium Pro.
The confusion with the K5 is, should you go choose
"586/K5/5x86/6x86" as the menu shows and not have TSC support, or
should you follow the help screen and choose "Pentium/TSC" which
shows it is for K5/K6/K6-3D?
Confusion #2 is what to do for K6?  Should you go with the menu,
which shows "PPro/K6/6x86MX" for K6, or should you follow the
help screen which couples the K6 with the K5 in "Pentium/TSC"?
I've been using the PPro setting with my K6-200 since February
and it works fine.
The menu should be a bit more specific IMHO and show:
PPro/K6/K6-2/K6-3/6x86MX/PentiumII
and also for Pentium/TSC, it should show other processors that
have the TSC.
At a bare minimum the help screen and the menu should be brought
into sync and corrected.
