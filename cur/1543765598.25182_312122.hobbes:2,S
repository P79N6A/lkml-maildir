No, I was tracking file creations/modifications/attemps of
access/directory creations|modifications/file movings/program
executions with some filter exceptions (avoid logging library loads by
ldd to preserve disk space).
It was a little module that logs file changes and program executions
to syslog (showing owner,pid,ppid,process name, return of
operation,etc), that, used with remote syslog logging to a 'strictly
secure' machine (just receive logs), keep security logs of everything
(like, it was possible to see apache running commands as "ls -la /" or
"ps aux", that, in fact, were signs of intrusion of try of intrusion,
because it's not a usual behavior of httpd. Maybe anyone exploited a
php page to execute arbitrary scripts...)
