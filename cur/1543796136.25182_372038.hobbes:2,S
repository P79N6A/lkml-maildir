there's various bugreports all over.  Having no source to disprove that
it's broken I call it broken for now.

What about just sending him patches?

No.  we're not going to do anything to make life for binary module easier,
quite contrary.

If you contributed that sequencer code and sent me a card I'm pretty sure
I'd love into adding support for this to a special DM module.  In fact we'd
need somthing similar for Certain SATA boards aswell.
OTOH the raid flag would be useless aswell there, because we'd of course
support this on identical cards without the raid bios aswell :)
