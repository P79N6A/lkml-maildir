if your processor is so fast that it gets bored waiting for your disk, that 
could be cool ;)
http://www.bootsplash.org
 has the utils for full-screen fb logo and other 
stuff, i.e. fbmngplay and fbtruetype, playback mng anims and drop text in any 
size/color/position on the screen in a TrueType font. mix that together with 
some nice bilinear filtering and you'd have the beginning of a jaw-dropping 
misuse of CPU :)
so in other words, without examining the practicality, yes. the fb can do that 
if the kernel console that gets rendered to the fb can be piped thru a gimpy 
pre-processor. sounds like fun. maybe one could even borrow the code from the 
starwars XScreenSaver to do the pretty rendering, since it already takes 
plaintext input.
