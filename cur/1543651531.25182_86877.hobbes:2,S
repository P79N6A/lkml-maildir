Having suffered through using the TET framework for the Open Group POSIX
test suite, I would agree that using TET sucks.  The code is so convoluted
as to be useless, and it is nearly impossible to see from the output what
it is actually doing.
I agree that having a simple C or shell or perl script which is the entire
test, and the rest of the framework is external to it is very desirable.
Cheers, Andreas
