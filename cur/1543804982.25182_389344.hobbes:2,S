Probably good advice, I have found mlockall() to be especially
problematic with multithreaded programs and NPTL, as glibc eats
RLIMIT_STACK of unswappable memory for each thread stack which defaults
to 8MB here - you go OOM really quick like this.  Most people don't seem
to realize the need to set a sane value with pthread_attr_setstack().
(Even when not mlock'ed, insanely huge thread stack defaults seem to
account for a lot of the visible bloat on the desktop - decreasing
RLIMIT_STACK to 512KB reduces the footprint of Gnome 2.12 by 100+ MB.)
