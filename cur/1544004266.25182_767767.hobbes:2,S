As you said, queue_work() does test_and_set_bit() which implies smp_mb()
either side of the function, so you're half way there, and run_workqueue()
calls spin_unlock_irq() just before calling work_clear_pending()...  So might
it make sense to move the work_clear_pending() into locked section?  Or would
that require an smp_mb__before_clear_bit()?
