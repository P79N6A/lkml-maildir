I misread the PCI registers below.  The power state was ok.
The problem is that memory enable and bus master were not set in PCI
register 4 after resume.  This also explains the register access
failures.
In tg3_resume(), we call pci_restore_state() which should re-enable
those 2 bits in PCI register 4.  Can you add some printk() to see why
those bits are not restored after pci_restore_state()?
Thanks.
