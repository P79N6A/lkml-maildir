Mike,

Nice to hear this - what are your uptimes for 2.4.3 and load?
Do you have similar hardware? I have a feeling that highmem
(2GB ram) is the most critical part kernel-wise since the
rest of our machines ('normal', 128-768MB ram) was very solid
under 2.4.3 and 2.4.9 kernels (but they are not so loaded).
