Has anybody put any thought towards how a userspace block driver would work?
Consider a block device implemented via an SSL network connection.  I 
don't want to put SSL in the kernel, which means the only other 
alternative is to pass data to/from a userspace daemon.
Anybody have any favorite methods?  [similar to] mmap'd packet socket? 
ramfs?
TIA,
	Jeff
