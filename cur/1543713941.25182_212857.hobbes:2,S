Playing around with some HP servers that are going live soon, I loaded
up 2.6.5-mm1 and all filesystems are ext3, the disks are mirrored 36Gb
SCSI using the cciss-driver. After the machine had been exceedingly
wellbehaved I decided to have fun and did this:
formail -s mail < big.mail.box
and thus injected approx 20k mails into postfix. The machine stayed
responsive and well behaved throughout, but the kernel log caught a
few of these:
