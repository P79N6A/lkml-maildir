In arch/ppc64/kernel/time.c:timer_interrupt There is the following ifndef:
#ifndef CONFIG_PPC_ISERIES
         ppc64_do_profile(regs);
#endif
I got access to a i series machine and tried a kernel with the 
surrounding ifndef removed to test whether the oprofile support would 
work on a i series machine. OProfile appears to work. Is there some 
reason that it is disabled for i series machines, e.g. doesn't work on 
particular i series machines?
