Fair enough.  However, we now no longer have the same core DRM functions
copied-and-pasted into each individual driver, renamed to foo_* and
tweaked to add AGP support.  If something needs fixing in the core DRM
stuff, it can be done in one place now, and all drivers will see the
fix.
Oh, and at least the new MGA driver is stable.
