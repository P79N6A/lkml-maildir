Hi,
This is a very large patch.  It may be easier to review if it could be
split on some logical way, that is at all possible (I don't know either
way).  This is just a quick note about some more trivial things.

Paulus has said that any pointer marked __iomem does not need to be
volatile ...

These initializations are unnecessary.

While I applaud the number of casts remove by this patch, this one is an
unnecessary addition.

You should do the above two line in the opposite order. Also do you
really want to keep getting the parent of the same node over and over
(i.e. you never change np)?

You probably want a final of_node_put(tmp).

These two could go as you just allocated zeroed memory.
