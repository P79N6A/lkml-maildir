	That may be true, and maybe they'll do it in the future.  Though
they'll need something other than MSDOS if they do it with disk images since
they'd have to license MSDOS.  Personally I don't particularly care what
they use for this alternative method, but I would like to see an ability to
do it under Linux.

	And you'll just clutter the kernel up more and more with this
filtering junk.  "Oh, this is okay, and that is okay, and this, and that..."
Blech, no thanks.

	Doing it at the drive level is the correct place for it, via a
jumper or a piece of encryption/authentication.
