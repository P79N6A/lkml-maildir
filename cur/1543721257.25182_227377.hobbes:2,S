At least, it's not really wrong. You need CONFIG_INPUT to be able to do
something with the HID stuff. However, to have an uniform interface, you
may also use the CONFIG_INPUT stuff to access your "normal" (AT / PS/2
style) keyboard.
In 2.6.x, that's cleaned up a bit. (Nearly?) all keyboards now push
their key strokes into the CONFIG_INPUT API, so you really want to have
CONFIG_INPUT (as long as this isn't some kind of embedded system).
