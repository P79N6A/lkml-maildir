Well, at first I thought you did not understand how permissions work. I
apologize for this, but your question was not clear at all. I've checked
on OpenBSD and can confirm that it works. However, it does not exactly
work, it passes /dev/fd/3 to the shell as Neil suggested it. Moreover,
argv[0] gets changed to /dev/fd/3 when the script is not readable, not
very useful :
$ cat > foo
#!/bin/sh
echo \$0=$0 \$1=$1 ...
$ chmod 755 foo
$ ./foo bar
$0=./foo $1=bar ...
$ chmod 111 foo
$ ./foo bar
$0=/dev/fd/3 $1=bar ...
So the very common dirname or ${0%/*} tricks used to get the execution
directory from the running script will not work. Worse, behaviour will
have to be validated both with AND without read permissions since it
works differently in both cases.
At least, feeding the script to stdin and renaming argv[0] to point to
it would have been better.

Willy
