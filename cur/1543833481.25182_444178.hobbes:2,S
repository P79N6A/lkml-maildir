Subject: Re: [PATCH 1/1] Fix boot on efi 32 bit Machines [try #4]

I converted the efi memory map to use the e820 table.
While converting i discovered why the kernel would allways
fail to boot through efi on Intel Macs without a proper fix.
From kernel 2.6.16 to kernel 2.6.17 a new check is made.
File arch/i386/pci/mmconfig.c -> funktion pci_mmcfg_init -> check e820_all_mapped
The courios thing is that this check will always fail on the
Intel Macs booted through efi. Parsing of the ACPI_MCFG table
returns e0000000 for the start. But this location is
not in the memory map which the efi firmware have :
BIOS-EFI: 00000000e00f8000 - 00000000e00f9000 (reserved)
So the e820_all_mapped would allways fail.
Anny suggestions how to fix this problem ? Maybe some kind
of whitelisting, using dmi_check_system ?
