yes, we should do the rename in this same patch as both patches have no 
impact on the actual kernel image. (sans source code line and string 
related deltas in the image.) Feel free to do the rename in his patch - 
that's the fastest way.
I'd suggest to rename from:
  DECLARE_PER_CPU(char, irqstack[IRQSTACKSIZE]);
  DECLARE_PER_CPU(char *, irqstackptr);
to:
  DECLARE_PER_CPU(char, irq_stack[IRQSTACKSIZE]);
  DECLARE_PER_CPU(char *, irq_stack_ptr);
In other cases, lets get Brian's patches in without further latencies so 
that we drain his pending-patches pipeline and get a consolidated base 
everyone can work from. Brian already had an unfortunate (and 
time-consuming) rebase/conflict-resolution pass due to us moving the 
percpu code from under him. We can do non-critical followups in separate 
delta patches.
