Hi,
I've been working through trying to create a virtual
bus.  I've
successfuly made it work for a single instance but
wanted to
confirm how to create multiple instances of the
virtual bus.  I
believe to do this you have only one instance of your
new
bus_type registered but register multiple instances of
struct
device for it.  I just wanted to confirm that was
correct.
Lastly how do you walk over all devices on a bus
instance?  I
note bus_for_each_dev but that appears to take a
bus_type
rather than struct device instance, hence I assume it
will return
all devices from all instances.  I know I could
compare each
device to see if it is on a certain bus instance but
wondered if
there was a better way?
Regards,
Simon
