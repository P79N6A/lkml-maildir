I'm not proposing keeping all functionality at the kernel. What
I'm proposing is that an existing mechanism for delivering data
between processes should be made more powerful instead of adding
a complex new mechanism. And, more generally, I'm arguing that 
if POSIX says "call K does Z" that does not necessarily mean the
kernel needs system call K.  Instead of using POSIX as a reason to
put yet more junk in the kernel, we should (A) evaluate which 
POSIX functionality really needs to be in the kernel, and 
(B) what POSIX functionality can be obtained by improvements using
the current API.
So, POSIX says sigqueue must send this goofy structure. Well, 
we have a generic problem with select that is more important than
POSIX -- because real applications depend on it. Perhaps we can 
provide 
           signal(SIG_ASYNC_NOTIFY,handler)
           fd = open("/proc/myid/posix_signals",2);
           ioctl(fd,SIG_NOTIFY,...)
handler:
          read(fd,&message,size)
          if message.type== POSIX_RT_SIGNAL
               ...
Maybe that's a stupid idea. But I bet there is some elegant method for
making the system better instead of just bigger.
