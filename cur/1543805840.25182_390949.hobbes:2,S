That's the primary purpose, though there's a couple of edge cases. 
For VBE state saving/restoring, it seems to be important to save the 
state before X has started rather than doing so at suspend time - some 
i855 systems break otherwise.
Not strictly related - Pavel, try taking a look at the acpi-support 
package in 
http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/a/acpi-support/
 . 
There's a large list of witelisted hardware there. OSDL recently set up 
a mailing list (desktop-portables@lists.osdl.org) for cross-distribution 
laptop discussion. It would probably be helpful to discuss working 
machines there, rather than duplicate the whitelisting efforts.
