i believe wli's latency-timing patch gives a pretty good indication of
the code path(s) involved - i'm using something quite similar to that. 
The printout triggers immediately at the end of a high latency, so the
stack contains a number of clues about what went on before.

what remains i believe is to improve wli's patch and to observe (and
fix) the maximum latencies. Also, your workload is a subset of what
other people might be running so wider testing is obviously needed as
well.
btw., with what max_sectors setting were you testing during these tests? 
In -O2 the hardirqs are not preemptable (yet) so with 1024 sectors you
should see quite high latencies due to the completion activity.
