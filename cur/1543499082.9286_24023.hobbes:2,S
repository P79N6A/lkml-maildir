   I would prefer to see:
   and use the uuid/label as a check, not a mechanism for mounting.
   Remember that /etc/fstab also documents to the _human_ sysadmin which disk
   is used where.
   That is, "/dev/scsi/c0t0d0..." relates to a physical position within a disk
   rack; a uuid does not.
The problem is that you want to mount the filesystem in the same place,
even if the SCSI ID changes.  For example, what happens if you insert a
new SCSI controller and so what was previously SCSI controller #0 is now
SCSI controller #1?  That's why it's better to reference filesystems to
be mounted by UUID's instead of by SCSI ID #'s.  Ideally, the system
shouldn't refuse to boot just because you've inserted a new SCSI
controller.
Obviously, you don't want to force the user to enter the UUID by hand;
there needs to be a good set of tools that do all of this automatically
for the user.  But what should be stored should be the UUID.
At some level, that's why I don't like devfs; it doesn't do enough, and
at the same time it does too much (it puts too much policy into the
kernel --- namely the device names, which is somethign the kernel should
be agnostic about).   
The real right solution requires writing a user-mode daemon which gets
informed by the kernel when interesting events happens, and then Does
The Right Thing.  Solaris's vold is an interesting example of such a
user-mode daemon, although it doesn't do everything right.  (And it
doesn't handle the device naming, although Solaris uses a partial
user-mode solution to handle that piece of things too.)
Some of the argumenets made in the past for devfs (i.e., optimizing the
speed of opening a device file) are really bad reasons.  Does anyone
really think that opening files in /dev is really something which
happens often enough that it should be optimized?!?  Opening device
files simply isn't something that happens all that often, and I suspect
that the incremental speedup between the dcache and devfs is barely
measuarable.
