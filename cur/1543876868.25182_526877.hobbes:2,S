That would be completely unmanagable on many systems with multiport
controllers and interfaces where the naming tells you things like which
cable port off which socket off which multiplexor is the one you are
talking about.
You can't dynamically identify serial ports, you can't generally speaking
probe the device the other end and get persistant identifiers.

Nope. The original design used different numbers of each type of port
quite intentionally. Having handy names for the onboard ports is useful
as well but not related. One or two people cheated and its finally come
back to haunt them.
