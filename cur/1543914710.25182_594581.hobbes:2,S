The thing about the build ID section that brings up issues with linking is
that it is a SHF_ALLOC, SHT_NOTE section.  As you mentioned, this is a
general, straightforward, and well-defined thing in ELF.  But in practice,
there were not previously SHF_ALLOC note sections used with custom linker
scripts like the kernel's.  (They are used every day in normal executables
and DSOs, but those don't use custom linker scripts.)
Thanks,
Roland
