Completed filesystems have a much higher barrier to entry, because they 
require a fresh review.
ext4 will go upstream MUCH faster, because it follows the standard 
process of Linux evolution, building on top of existing code with 
progressive changes:
	cp -a ext3 ext4
	update ext4
	update ext4
	update ext4
	...
This process builds upon existing reviews and knowledge of existing 
code.  This process also guarantees a higher degree of stability during 
development, because the interim changes must always form a complete, 
working, usable filesystem.

Anyone who fails to respect the kernel development process, the process 
of building consensus, is turn not respected, flamed, and/or ignored.
If you don't respect us, why should we respect you?

Distros follow their own release model, and don't have a care about what 
Hans Reiser thinks they should do.
<vendor hat on>
Red Hat has a pipeline in place for offering new technologies to users: 
  Fedora Core -> RHEL, and sometimes RHEL technology previews.  SuSE 
presumably does something similar with OpenSUSE.

I always feel sad to hear technologists wail about politics.
In my experience, the cause of such is almost always the fault of the 
submittor, ignoring consensus.  But once the submittor has decided that 
"politics" are cause of their troubles, the submittor focuses on that 
rather than addressing the technology objections that were raised.
With you in particular, you demonstrated NO interest in maintaining 
reiser3, once reiser4 began to make a splash.  Linux kernel code exists 
for DECADES, and as such, long term maintenance is a CRITICAL aspect of 
development.
Regardless of whatever new whiz-bang technology exists in reiser4, there 
is a very real worry that you will abandon reiser4 once its in the tree 
for a few years, just like what happened with reiser3.
