It's a 3CCFE575CT Cardbus NIC.  In 2.4 it is supported by 3c59x.c.  In 2.2
it is supported by 3c575_cb.c from the pcmcia_cs package.
I guess you need to copy /usr/src/linux/drivers/pci/pci.ids onto
/usr/share/pci.ids so lspci has an up-to-date database.

lspci is reading the device ID from offsets 0x2f/0x2e, not from 0x03/0x02.
