But Bill already said he doesn't want it, and there are several other
architectures than sparc which don't have it - it's unclear why any do.
Several people were working to get atomic_add_return and its friends into
the remaining architectures (such as i386), Andrew's taken those patches
into -mm5, so it would make sense for reiser4 to use atomic_sub_return now.
Oh, except that particular variant is missing from s390: better add it in.
