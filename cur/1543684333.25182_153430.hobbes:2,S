It can be enabled _only_ if CONFIG_USB_SERIAL=y.  If CONFIG_USB_SERIAL=m
then the option should not show up, as it becomes a module paramater
option.  The original code was correct.

No, we _really_ want these tucked away where it is hard to find them.
Almost noone should enable these, but if you really want them, you still
can.  Putting them into their own sub-menu was deemed the best for this.
