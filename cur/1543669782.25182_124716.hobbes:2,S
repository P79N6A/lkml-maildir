And X is taking 99% of your CPU?
I have the *same* problem (mind the "99% from X" clause) with a nvidia 
geforce2. Couldn't find what the source of this was... But I can tell 
you that it's not the kernel.. I tried many combinations of kernel + 
nvidia drivers (that were running OK for many months) and it still 
freezes X. So, to me, it's X or glibc or something else, but:
As I don't need GL accell I just installed the nv driver from X :)
Anyway, back then I found some reports of people having the same 
problem. Google for it ;)
