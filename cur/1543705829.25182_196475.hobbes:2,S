Pavel,
Here's some comments after trying out your 2 patches. 
First, the PCMCIA patch worked great, I can now plug/unplug power cord with
yenta_socket loaded :) Maybe now I can _haul_ this laptop to a cafe and use 
the WLAN, hehe. In case anybody else needs them, I'll put the patches 
I'm using to:
http://www.muru.com/linux/amd64/
The powernow-k8.c patch did not work, as my numpst is 8, not 3. So why not
just ignore the numpst, as it is not used?
Maybe replace this
 		if (psb->numpst != 1) {
 			printk(KERN_ERR BFX "numpst must be 1\n");
-			return -ENODEV;
+			if (psb->numpst == 3) {
+				printk(KERN_INFO PFX "assuming arima notebug\n");
+				arima = 1;
+			} else
+				return -ENODEV;
 		}
With this instead:
 
 		dprintk(KERN_DEBUG PFX "numpst: 0x%x\n", psb->numpst);
 		if (psb->numpst != 1) {
-			printk(KERN_ERR BFX "numpst must be 1\n");
-			return -ENODEV;
+			printk(KERN_WARNING BFX "numpst listed as %i "
+			       "should be 1. Using 1.\n", psb->numpst);
 		}
 
Hmm, looks like that contains a bug, where it does not change psb->numpst to 1,
but that's not used anyways, so it could all be actually chopped out?
I see a little problem with hardcoding the values:
+		if (arima) {
+			ppst[1].fid = 0x8;
+			ppst[1].vid = 0x6;
+#ifdef THREE
+			ppst[2].fid = 0xa;
+			ppst[2].vid = 0x2;
+#endif
 		}
This would fail if I upgraded my CPU, right? 
What do you think about using module options maxfid and maxvid?
Regards,
Tony
