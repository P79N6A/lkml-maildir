Hi folks,
i believe the OOM has been a matter of frequent discussion for some
time now. The initial implementation was considered good enough for
some, ugly and inefficient in selecting the right task to kill for
others and downright unecessary for yet more of linux users. I belong
to somewhere in between the 1st and the second group.
I personally believe that heuristics never work 100% of the time, even
 when carefully thought of, as Andrea conceded. Nevertheless the
kernel needs some guidance upon which to base a decision. This
guidance can be a default, or a user-based solution  using whatever
possible algorithm to do the ranking. One thing is for sure, the
kernel should be the one to do the kill ...
I believe that we need to test some more and see what should be the
default ranking approach. Certainly Andrea's implementation looks
promising, but as a user I would like to opt if I feel capable to
implement my own ranking algorithm, in a way that is controlled by
myself.
my 2 cents
