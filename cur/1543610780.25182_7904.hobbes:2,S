Correct, sort-of.  The storage is not allowed to corrupt any data that
is unrelated to the currently active operation, (ie adjacent tracks or
sectors).  Of course write-caching is asking for trouble.

Correct.  If a write gets interrupted in the middle of it's operation,
it has not yet returned any completion status, (unless you've enabled
write-caching, in which case, you're already asking for trouble)  A
subsequent read of this half-written sector can return uncorrectable
status though, which would be unfortunate if this sector was your
allocation table, and the write was a read-modify-write.

Reading a sector that was a partial-write because of a power-loss, and
returning UNCORRECTABLE status, is not a failure of the drive.
