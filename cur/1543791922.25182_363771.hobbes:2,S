thanx for info + your work
 | This is a bug in the ide layer as CF pcmcia devices are marked as
 | removable but the devices (and the behaviour of ide-cs) does not fit
 | the Linux definition of such devices.

ah!... ok, now i understand more about that. what your patch is doing is 
removing the "removable" status from them, right? what were the bad sides 
of this patch? (why didn't it made to the linus or at least mm-tree?)
 | I'm hoping to work out a patch to change this in a manner acceptable
 | to everyone but haven't found time yet. I've not forgotten though.
if you need, i can test possible solutions. i have Apacer, Kodak and PQI 
CF cards; SanDisk SD cards, a panasonic SD-to-CF convertor and a 
CF-PCMCIA card. 
greetings,
Damir
