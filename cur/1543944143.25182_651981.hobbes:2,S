Note that a lot of these are already in the MAINTAINERS file.
But for the record, here's mine, in the order they need to be pulled
from.
  Driver core:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/gregkh-2.6/gregkh-01-driver/
  PCI:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/gregkh-2.6/gregkh-02-pci/
  USB:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/gregkh-2.6/gregkh-03-usb/
These are all quilt trees, with the series file in the directory for the
order of the patches, and a README saying what kernel version they have
been rebased against.

Oh oh oh, I get merged first!  me me me!

This is going to get really interesting, especially when (not if) we do
more global api changes.  Look at the last round of kobject changes.
That touched a lot of different places, and other trees ended up not
building because of it, because I changed apis and they had added new
code based on the old apis.
I think the only way to fix this is not going to just "drop the tree"
like you are suggesting, but to let both people know (the person who
caused the change, and the person who's tree broke after the merge), and
then either add a "fixup patch" for the build like Andrew has been
doing, or disabling something from the build section.
As I know I'm going to be changing more driver core apis[1] this week,
I'm sure we will get a very good set of examples of this for you to see
in action :)
Good luck,

[1] Hopefully the "multiple drivers for a single device" feature people
have been asking for for years will be landing soon, of course the
number of odd places in the kernel that made the assumption that we
could only have one driver per device is causing lots of fun...
