Kexec primarily needs the reboot/trap hooks in working order, and exported,
for it to live externally to the kernel.  
Currently the reboot_notifier call chain is private to sys.c, and is not
exported even to other parts of the kernel.
Even together device_shutdown, and the reboot_notifier do not properly shutdown
the cpus on an SMP system.
Plus we are missing quite a ->shutdown methods at random in the kernel, and if
kexec is not easily available someone might not get around to writing
and debugging them.
Plus a system call seems the natural interface for something that
appears to be a reboot.
