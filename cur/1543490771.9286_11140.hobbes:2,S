Definitely not a kernel issue, it's a libc issue, and not even a bug anyway.

Your problem was that you needed the getchar() to make the printf() work.
This is probably because your output is in buffered mode, there is no '\n'
and you don't fflush(stdout) before the execl(), so the printf() just buffers
and the write is never actually done.
