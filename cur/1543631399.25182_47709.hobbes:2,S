Hi folks,
linux-2.5.17/arch/ia64/kernel/irq.c has a
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_LOCAL_APIC,
but I dont see the config option in any ia64 config.in files.....
wondering if this is just some piece of code which will never be compiled...
Also, linux-2.5.17/arch/ia64/kernel/irq.c prints apic_timer_irqs, and they
don't seem to be defined for ia64.  The piece of code (irq.c) is also covered 
by 
#ifdef CONFIG_X86
wonder if the condition is ever true.....
Pls let me know what I am missing
disclaimer: I don't know much about ia64 
Kiran
