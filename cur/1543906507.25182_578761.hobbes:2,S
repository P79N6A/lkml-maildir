Please do. Its burning the proverbial hole in my pocket; I'd really
like to get this off my list of things I worry about.

Heh. I have no difficulty living with ugly code: its actually a 
great excuse to fix things instead of doing "real work" :-)
Rather, the menagerie of hardware I have access to is constantly 
changing; I don't have a symbios card just right now, and it might 
take a few days to even find someone who did.  Which is an incredibly
unpleasent, unrewarding activity.
