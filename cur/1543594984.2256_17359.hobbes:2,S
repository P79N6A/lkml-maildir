Hi,
I have the same problem, only mine occurs early in the boot process
(right after a message saying something like "trying to mount old
root..."; or maybe s/mount/unmount)so I don't have a log.  I have a
similar system: dual PIIIs w/ Adaptec AIC-7xxx controller, an HP Kayak. 
I saw some earlier messages about AIC-7xxx problems w/ 2.4.5, so I tried
using aic7xxx_old and also tried a patch someone mentioned.  I have yet
to be able to bring up my machine with 2.4.5 under any combination of
aic7xxx drivers, so maybe it's not the driver after all.
Any ideas?  I built the kernel w/ gcc 2.91.66 (kgcc).
Thanks,
Chris Leger

You can come up with a hundred reasons why a thing can't be done, 
and you have to eat them all when someone else does it.
