And the 2.4.2-ac26 apm.c has version 1.14 changes listed that are different
from the 1.14. changes listed in the patch from linuxcare.com.au/apm,

Suspend is requested -> suspend is executed
Suspend is canceled (rejected) -> suspend is canceled
Seems perfectly OK to me.

But there should be no policy in the kernel ! ;-)
