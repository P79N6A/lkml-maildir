IPoIB-CM rx skb allocation is not generic to be used by UD, it allocates 
more buffers than needed if mtu is not 64K, and doesn't query the real 
max_num_sg from the device. I am thinking to have a generic skb allocation 
in IPoIB based on matrix of (ipoib-mtu-size, page-size, max_num_sg, 
head-size).
