Misconception.  You can't cp /usr/src/linux/vmlinux to /dev/fd0 and
have it work on any architecture.  You -can- cp
.../arch/i386/boot/zImage to /dev/fd0 and have it work, but I never
proposed we break that.  (And what I want would let you do e.g. 
cat arch/i386/boot/bootsect vmlinux.gz >/dev/fd0.)
