Subject: [PATCH] Fix jiffies.h comment
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

jiffies.h includes a comment informing that jiffies_64 must be read with the 
assistance of the xtime_lock seqlock. The comment text, however, calls 
jiffies_64 "not volatile", which should probably read "not atomic".
