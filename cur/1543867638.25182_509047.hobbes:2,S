The point of GPL, is that even if the vendor stopped supporting, you
could fix the device driver by yourself. This is really happening,
vendors do sell hardware with broken drivers and make the suers cry
out loudly. At the mercy of the vendor. (This has happened and is
still happening)
This is exactly the whole point about GPL. If you think otherwise, you
are just one of the vendors trying to force your hopeless driver to
clueless users.
So, IMO when someone says binary only modules are the way, i wouldn't
bite the line. I don't think this is a religion, but a freedom to use
what you want.
HTH,
