note also that a lot of mem copies were already _not_ shielded with
clds, eg all copy_user() and friends.

this should be explicitly documented somewhere in Documentation/
(it applies also to third party kernel code, ie modules).

first, namespace polution, eg copy_struct() would be safer and less
conflict prone.
second, gcc seems to generate "better" code for the builtins than for
the inlined asms -- probably due to more optimal reg allocation (there's
room for improvement in string.h's routines; i played with that, but after
seeing incorrect code being generated (afaicr having two identical inputs
with only one of them marked as clobbered was the trigger) i gave up and
used the builtin). Note "better" doesn't necessarily == faster -- i didn't
benchmark them.
third, gcc unconditionally generating clds everywhere is a compiler
issue, which should be fixed in compiler land. something like
-mno-implicit-clds. (working around the problem by disabling gcc
optimizations isn't an optimal solution)

as an additional datapoint - i didn't see any problems either, during
the last couple of months that i ran w/o (most of) the clds.

these changes are visible to userland; either your previous
