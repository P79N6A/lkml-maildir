Makes sense I guess.
There have been other times when I've needed access to the registers from
within hard IRQ.  But I forget the reason.
It would be more general, although a little slower to do:
DEFINE_PER_CPU(global_irq_regs);
do_IRQ(...)
{
	...
	struct pt_regs **cpu_regs_slot = __get_cpu_var(global_irq_regs);
	struct pt_regs *save = *cpu_regs_slot;
	*cpu_regs_slot = &regs;
	...
	*cpu_regs_slot = save;
}
And to teach the sysrq code to grab *__get_cpu_var(global_irq_regs).
Note that global_irq_regs is only valid if in_interrupt().  The sysrq
handler can be called from process context via /proc/sysrq-trigger and
should bale out if !in_interrupt().
+static inline void sysrq_show_registes(struct pt_regs *pt_regs)
typo.
