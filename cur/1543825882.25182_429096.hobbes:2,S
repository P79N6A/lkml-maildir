Hi Jeff,
I'm trying to get a Thinkpad X60 working properly.  My biggest remaining 
problem is the failure of AHCI to resume properly after suspend-to-ram.  
I know the problem is known about and there are patches floating about 
to address it, but I don't really understand the larger picture.  There 
were some discussions about it a couple of months ago, but I haven't 
seen anything much since.
Is there a git tree which should work properly on this hardware, or a 
current patch to do it?  Does somebody need to bring the existing patch 
up to date?  Does fixing this require more infrastructure changes which 
are still brewing?
I'm running 2.6.17-rc2-mm1 (soon mm2).  I've tried porting Hannes 
Reinecke's patch to this tree, but there have been some code changes 
which cause significant conflicts, and I don't really know enough about 
the driver/hardware to be confident in my changes.  That said, I have 
got something compiling, but it crashes somewhere in the kobject stuff 
when it encounters the first port with no drive on it; this looks like a 
more general scsi/libata bug; I'll track it down if its interesting.
Anyway, I'd appreciate it if you could give me some hints about how to 
get a fix with some current kernel.
Thanks,
    J
