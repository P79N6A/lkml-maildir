For user space processes this condition is always true.
For kernel threads:
(1) the change of tsk->mm from NULL to a nonzero value is only made in
fs/aio.c:use_mm() along with the setting of PF_BORROWED_MM under
the task_lock(),
(2) the change of tsk->mm from a nonzero value to NULL is only made in
fs/aio.c:unuse_mm() along with the resetting of PF_BORROWED_MM
under the task_lock().
Therefore, by taking the task_lock() here we make sure that the condition
is alyways false when we check it for kernel threads.
