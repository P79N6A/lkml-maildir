Please don't re-introduce tasklist_lock unless strictly needed. And in this case
it doesn't help, sys_getrlimit() changes ->rlim[] under task_lock().
Hovewer, I think the whole patch is not right. The "tsk" itself is pinned, but its
->signal is not stable and can be == NULL.
You can use lock_task_sighand() to access ->signal.
Oleg.
