  Hi Nathan, and congratilations for the SGI work.
  Now i have a Mandrake with the 2.5.75 kernel and XFS in
all partitions. The filesystem looks work very well.
  I am planning install 2.6.0-test3 when it comes and i wanna
ask you: how can i know what blocksize am i using?, and how
know what is the page size in my system?.
  Thanks you, very much, in advance.
  Regards.
  Jose.
