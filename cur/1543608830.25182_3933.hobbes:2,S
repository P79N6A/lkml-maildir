ASCII is readable by all languages with little programmer effort. In C, you
can use a simple scanf, Perl and shells like plain ascii best.
When /proc is turned into some binary interface we'd need to create little
programs which read the binary values from the files and output them on
their stdout, which is quite cumbersome, IMHO.

Yes, maintain compatibility for 2.6 and try to dump it for 2.8.
Heck, 95% compatibility could even be achieved using a 100% userspace app
which serves the data over named pipes.
