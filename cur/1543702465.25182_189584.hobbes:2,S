So what? If you decide handle a signal, then you are taking full
responsibility for the recovery process. It is up to _you_ to take action
to either recover the lock or to undo it, not the kernel. To determine
whether or not the lock was taken on the server you can just do a
fcntl(GETLK) call.
All the kernel cares about is that when the process exits, it needs to
clean up all the locks that are owned by that pid.
