Hello,
How are you, I am JOHN PHILLIP and I am the Assistant Senior
Manager
Department of Manpower Operations of a company [Adonis Engineering Ltd]
that
manufactures Heavy Duty Industrial Equipment/Machinery.
The company is headquartered in the United Kingdom, although we have
about
21 regional administrative offices spread around the world.
We recently began an aggressive market share expansion drive that has
seen
us expanding our clientele to the United States and we make bold to say
that
we have established a significant foothold as regards percentage market
share/customer base in the American region.
We are now seriously looking for trustworthy representatives in USA,
Canada,
Mexico and all other US Enclaves who will help as trade fronts between
us
and our ever-growing clientele in the US and above-mentioned zones .I
am
using this means to ask if you would be interested to work with us even
if
it be on a part time basis.
The Job entails the following. We now have customers we supply on a
weekly
basis in
the United States, Canada and Mexico and they [the customers] make
installmental payments for our supplies every week in money orders -
and
sometimes cheques.
SO, we need reliable Sales Payment Processing Representatives in the
United States and the above-mentioned areas to work and assist us in
processing incoming weekly payments from our customers/clients.
You will be paid 10% of the total of what payments we route through you
weekly
as sales proceeds.
The payments come mostly by money order - but sometimes cheques. So
basically you cash payments routed to you and deduct your 10% on the spot
while you send the balance to Company headquarters or any of our
numerous
regional offices that you will be directed to.
You will remit the balance [after deducting your 10% commission] via
Western
Union Money transfer or Moneygram money transfer.
