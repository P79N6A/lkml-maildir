Well it's not so clear so please elaborate since I'm curious. Especially
it'd be interesting to know if this is that an arm specific kernel
crash, or would it happen on x86 too?
There sure can be arch dependencies where an hard_local_irq_disable can
be necessary in some places, but that's quite a separate topic, and on
x86 I don't see why it should crash.
Thanks.
