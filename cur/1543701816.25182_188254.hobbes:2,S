Linus, what Andries is saying is that if you export a directory (say
/home) the process of exporting it somehow uses the /dev device number so
if the server reboots and gets a different device number for the partition
that /home is on the clients won't see it as the same export, breaking the
NFS requirement that a server can be rebooted.
I don't agree with him becouse if the NFS server does include /dev info in
what it shows to the outside world it's already broken.
