Congrats, the problem isn't there anymore:))
Now (with -test6), when I plug in my USB flash disk, SCSI subsystem
isn't up (there are no sd_mod and/or sg loaded).
When I manualy load sd_mod and sg, plug in USB disk, everything goes ok,
but the horor-scene arises when unplugging. one oops pops up, and after
couple of moments another one, which blocks the system. I can send
oops-report, if anyone asks.
