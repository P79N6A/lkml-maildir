Yes, I'm afraid it needs an is_vm_hugetlb_page(vma) in there somehow:
as you observe, that's what everything else uses to avoid huge issues.
A pmd_huge(*pmd) test is tempting, but it only ever says "yes" on x86:
we've carefully left it undefined what happens to the pgd/pud/pmd/pte
hierarchy in the general arch case, once you're amongst hugepages.
Might follow_huge_addr() be helpful, to avoid the need for a vma?
Perhaps, but my reading is that actually we've never really been
testing that path's success case (because get_user_pages already
skipped is_vm_hugetlb_page), so it might hold further surprises
on one architecture or another.
Many thanks to Hans for persisting, and pointing us to pagemap
to explain this hugepage leak: yes, the pmd_none_or_clear_bad
will be losing it - and corrupting target user address space.
Cc'ed Matt: he may have a view on what he wants his pagewalker
to do with hugepages: I fear it would differ from one usage to
another.  Skip over them has to be safest, though not ideal.
