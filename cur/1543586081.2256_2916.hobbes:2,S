And what would you do if the names collide ?
This might work for drives with unique identifiers in hardware, but for 
anything else it is a nice addition, but I wouldn't identify an essential 
partition that way. Furthermore you need to address removable media. There a 
way to specify a drive opposed to a filesystem or medium is needed.
