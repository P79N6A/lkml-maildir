Yes, that is wanted.  They bitrot too easily -- not good.

It seems odd to be building code in Documentation/, but I can live
with that.  It was primarily Christoph who was opposed to that.
He suggested samples/ and I went along with it just to break the
impasse (since no one else was making any comments on it at that
time).
Sam, would building code in Documentation/ cause problems for
kbuild?
