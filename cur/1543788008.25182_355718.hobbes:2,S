Also the inclusion of ktimer (I believe) has made a dependency with
mpparse and IO_APIC.  Since now mpparse.c calls setup_IO_APIC_early which
is defined only if X86_IO_APIC is, the kernel wont link without.
So, is the following patch sufficient? Or does mpparse.c need to be
different, that is should we not call setup_IO_APIC_early if X86_IO_APIC
is not set?
I haven't looked too deep into this, and wont until -rt6 gets fixed.
Better yet, Thomas is probably better at looking into this.
