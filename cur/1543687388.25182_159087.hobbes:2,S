No... The above snippet just short-circuits the process of doing an
RPC call in order to look the file up on the *server*. Doing such a
lookup would be wrong since it can race with a file creation on
another NFS client.
IOW the result of the above 2 lines should be the immediate creation
of a negative dentry (i.e. one without an inode) that open_namei() can
pass on to vfs_create().
When we get to the unlink() call, we shouldn't be hitting nfs_lookup()
at all unless something somewhere is causing this first dentry to be
permanently dropped out of the dcache.
In short the scenario should be that
  - mkstemp() does an open(O_EXCL) -> nfs_lookup() creates hashed
    negative dentry -> nfs_create() then does an O_EXCL call to the
    server and instantiates the dentry.
  - unlink() walks the pathname -> finds the existing dentry using
    cached_lookup() and only calls down to nfs_lookup_revalidate().
Cheers,
