PLEASE, read linux-kernel archives before starting panic, Ok ? This question
was already talked to death here few times. UID was, is and will be 16bit in
Linux kernel 1.x & 2.[012]. UID expansion is sheduled for 2.3 (may be not early
stages). This is VERY non-trivial task as UID size is hardcoded in many-many
places of kernel. Even if needed four bytes per inode is reserved in ext2fs.
For now -- use glibc2 (there are UIDs are 32bit even if you could not use
UIDs > 65535 just now and UID's and GID's in getpwnam ARE 32bit!) and hope for
best with 2.3 and then 2.4 (3.0?)...
