Thank you for the explanation.  But, this brings to mind two other questions:
  Does the option not also make assembly less readable on other architectures?
  If one is interested in smaller code, why not use -Os?
Also, does -fno-reorder-blocks actually defeat __builtin_expect()?
(GCC documentation doesn't really say that.)
