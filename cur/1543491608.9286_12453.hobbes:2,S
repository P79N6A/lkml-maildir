For a project I'm heading up, we need a journaling file system (log-based
metadata) for quick filesystem recovery after crashes.  I do believe that
there is some work going on with one, and I'm interested in it's status
and assisting with it in any way.  If there isn't a work in progress, or
its completion is targeted too far in the future we will have to write the
filesystem entirely ourselves.
