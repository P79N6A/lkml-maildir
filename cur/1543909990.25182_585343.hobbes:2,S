There's something simple here that I just don't understand.

My gut impression (maybe wrong?) is that the scaled time is,
in a certain sense, "more accurate" than the unscaled time.
In fact, the unscaled time gives me the impression of being
rather meaningless, as it has no particular significance
with respect to the wall-clock, and it also doesn't give
any accurate hint of how much cpu resource was actually
consumed.
If one has a cpu with frequency scaling, then when would
one ever be interested in the non-scaled time? If the answer
is "never", then why not just always use the scaled time,
instead of adding more stuff to the kernel structs?
