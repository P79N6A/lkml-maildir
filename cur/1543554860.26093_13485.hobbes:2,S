Subject: MANOS/Ring 0 Linux lists back up
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/11/17/10

Now that sendmail/load average  problems have been nailed for 2.2.18>
2.4, the mailing lists are working.  We apologize, but the server was
upgraded and during the upgrade, most folks addresses got zapped in the
var/lib/majordomo/lists directory, so folks who want to track Andre and
our work on the ring 0 Linux on the MANOS kernel will need to sign back
up at majordomo@timpanogas.org again.   As much as this has happened in
the past on LKML,
everyone is probably used to ir already anyway.  
Thanks,
Jeff
