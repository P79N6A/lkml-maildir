Subject: [PATCH] Solved: 2.4.20, 2.5.66 have different IDE channel  order

  2.4 builds its global PCI device list in breadth-first order.
  2.5 is doing the scan that way but defers the construction of the
global list until later and then does it depth-first.  This causes
devices to found in different order by drivers. The below fixed that
problem for me:

+++ linux-2.5.66-uni/drivers/pci/bus.c	Fri Apr 18 19:08:04 2003

  * Add newly discovered PCI devices (which are on the bus->devices
  * list) to the global PCI device list, add the sysfs and procfs
  * entries.  Where a bridge is found, add the discovered bus to

+ * the parents list of child buses, and recurse (breadth-first

  *
  * Call hotplug for each new devices.
