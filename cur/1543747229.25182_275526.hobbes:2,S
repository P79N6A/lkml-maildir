My suggestion was simply about unifying the namespace for selection in
the file system and selection within XML files using a syntax related to
(but not necessarily identical with) XPath.
 I was not suggesting you should do anything special with the content of
the XML files, even if the XML file contains an XPath reference.
(The latter could be interesting to think about as a separate issue
later, but it is certainly not part of my simpler suggestion.)
