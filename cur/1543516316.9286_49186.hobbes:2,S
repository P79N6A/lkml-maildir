   Not at all. For one thing, you can have the same thread that does the
   'poll' do all the actual I/O. This works well with a send queues and receive
   queues. Since non-blocking network I/O is so fast, it's almost impossible
   for this I/O thread to become a bottleneck.
It depends on the application.  Consider an IMAP server, with
potentially 10,000+ open connections, and each connection is going to
last for the entire mail-reading session, and will be idle most of the
time except when the user makes some requests that requires going to the
IMAP server.  This is a very different access pattern than you would see
on HTTP.   
If the IMAP server uses poll() to determine when the client has sent a
new IMAP request, you don't want one thread handling every single IMAP
command, since IMAP requests can take a long time to service.  It's not
just non-blocking network I/O.  With RT SIGIO, different threads will
automatically get dispatched for each new connection that has a new IMAP
request on it.  With poll() you will need to manually dispatch the
request to a new thread.
