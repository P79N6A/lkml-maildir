I found that starting dosemu which uses the video bios and calls int 10h
to restore text mode will restore it for me.  Switching out or kill -9ing
it seems to bring the restored mode to the console... I haven't done this
for a while, though. :)  "restoretextmode" (svgalib?) didn't fix it
usually because it didn't restore the card-specific registers. 
Otherwise, I donno. :)  It'd be nice if X had a little "restore mode from
file" extension thing, instead of setting it back the way it was when
it's started...
