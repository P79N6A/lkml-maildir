I wrote it badly. The driver is written old-styled with
pci_find_device function, which Greg KH wants to eliminate from the
kernel. The way how to do it is to rewrite the driver to PCI hotplug
(not as much work). The code needs to be splitted, some for loops
would go away, you will get an event, when the device, you decribe in
pci_tbl, is in the system.
