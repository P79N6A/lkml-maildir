I actually ran accross that patch this morning on the ebtables lists but i
wasnt sure it would fix the problem i was having.  I will get this patched
into the kernel and see what happens.  Thanks  for the responce, if this
went on much longer this $4,000 machine was going to become a paper weight
:)
Best Regards,
Shaun Reitan
