    If there *really* are people who want to get it all,
    we could create a digested   linux-all  list.
    On the other hand, they can do like I do:  subscribe
    all interesting into separate addresses (aliases),
    which go into separate folders.
    As things are, people who are using Yahoo or Hotmail,
    or whatever Mail-ISP thing out there are usually
    being bounced (and removed) because of the very high
    traffic volume at linux-kernel overflowing their
    mailboxes already.  (Digest won't help them there.)
