Not if you allow link(2) on them.  And not if you design and market your
stuff as a general-purpose backdoor into kernel.  Note how *EVERY* *DAMN*
*OPERATION* is made possible to override by "plugins".  Which is the reason
for deadlocks in question, BTW.
Don't fool yourself - that's what Hans is selling.  Target market: ISV.
Marketed product: a set of hooks, the wider the better, no matter how
little sense it makes.  The reason for doing that outside of core kernel:
bypassing any review and being able to control the product being sold (see
above).
Shame that it got an actual filesystem mixed in with the marketing plans
and general insanity...
