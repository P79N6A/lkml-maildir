No I was just curious. It's strange that your system doesn't work without 
PCI BIOS though. Is it an older laptop? The assumption so far
was that everything modern can do type 1 without problems (except 
one broken Apple system). Apparently that's not universally true.

The patch I posted should have fixed that.
Although I think it might be better to do panic() instead of printk.
