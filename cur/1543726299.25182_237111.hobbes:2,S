Sent this to linux-net@ with no response today, anyone care to comment?
In the e1000-5.2.30.1 driver, "they" no longer propagate pdev->irq into
netdev->irq.  This looks safe to add back in, am I mistaken?  I want
ifconfig to report the irq, which it no longer does without netdev->irq.
This is on a 2.4 kernel (no MSI).
thx
