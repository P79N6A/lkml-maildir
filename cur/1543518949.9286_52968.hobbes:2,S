Not really.  It's an equivalent problem to automatically loading the driver 
for your particular SCSI card -- the kernel doesn't know what sort of parallel 
ports you have, and neither do depmod or modprobe.  The old scheme was even 
more of a hack, in my opinion.
We could add some magic to modutils to let you say "pretend that module X 
depends on module Y".  This would possibly be a tiny bit neater than using 
post-install but I don't think it really buys anything.
