Any feedback is good feedback. I'm not suprised it has not
happened again. The necessary conditions are not common and
the timing window is small. As Andrew pointed out,
DEBUG_PAGEALLOC likely helped uncover this.
Decoding the 2 oops to specific lines of code strongly
suggests this is what happened to you. The decoding showed
the tty open and close (release) paths from different
processes going after the same tty structure at the same time.
Thanks,
Paul
