Indeed!

Non-atomic versions such as __ClearPageLRU()/__ClearPageActive() are 
not usable, though.
PPC:
static __inline__ void __clear_bit(unsigned long nr,
                                   volatile unsigned long *addr)
{
        unsigned long mask = BITOP_MASK(nr);
        unsigned long *p = ((unsigned long *)addr) + BITOP_WORD(nr);
        *p &= ~mask;
}
