The qualifiers I reported are not included above so don't take it to mean
wide ranging.
I reported pcmcia in all forms was broken for test8 on -my hardware-.
Other kernels such as test10-prex that I'm on now are workable with dhinds
pcmcia.  I sent you all the requested information you asked for in several
forms.  The kernel's idea of the the sockets just doesn't work...again, on
-my hardware-.
It doesn't matter what voodoo you practice, all of the kernels in the last
year have been unable to drive -my hardware- in any sort of stable fashion.
Recent kernels just can't figure out IRQs for the sockets.
David's package works in all situations except for the combined ne2k/modem
that I reported earlier and the ray_cs in similar fashion.
For the second report, when the kernel did figure out IRQs for the sockets,
plugging in a card sometimes killed all software interrupts.  I.e. hardware
responded such as caps, screen blank/active etc, but no mouse or key events
made it past the kernel.  Unplugging a card or putting it in socket 0
normally caused a plethura of unending OOPSes or another hang on the
insertion.
Ted, please put my qualifier back in, "On this NEC Versa LX laptop", I don't
want my reports taken out of context. :)
