It is. But you don't have the same rights to a rented machine as you do to one 
you have purchased. In fact, in renting a machine you have to agree to 
a "renters contract" - and that can state *whatever* the person that is 
renting the machine to you feels like having it state. And yes, they can even 
have terms in it that violate the GPL. Not that a "renters contract" ("rental 
agreement" or whatever they call them in your jurisdiction) that has those 
terms can *legally* violate the GPL - but it doesn't stop them from existing.
