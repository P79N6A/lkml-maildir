Hello,
Every time I compile 2.4.25 I get the same errors throughout dmesg:
attempt to access beyond end of device
03:02: rw=0, want=1020128, limit=1020127
attempt to access beyond end of device
03:05: rw=0, want=5116672, limit=5116671
attempt to access beyond end of device
03:06: rw=0, want=3068384, limit=3068383
This is happening consistently with every single machine regardless of
the type of hardware. Happens with various partitions, but always trying
to access one inode passt the limit. Reverting back to 2.4.24 gets rid
of the errors. What could have changed with regards to ext3 between
2.4.24 and 2.4.25 that could be triggering these errors? This is only
happening on machines running RedHat 7.3. Newer distributions, such as
RedHat 9 do just fine. Perhaps old libraries? If so, is there a way to
fix this somehow?
Thanks,
Bert
