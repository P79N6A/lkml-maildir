Hi!
The driver for the natsemi NIC does not properly filter out requested
multicast groups when in multicast mode.  Multicast groups I joined
are simply dropped by the MAC address filter of the card, the kernel
filters them correctly in allmulti or promiscuous mode. I've tested
driver versions 1.05 which comes with linux 2.4.2, an older version
that came with linux-2.4.0test12 and 1.07 which came with 2.4.2-ac20.
I contacted Donald Becker and he told me to post it here.
