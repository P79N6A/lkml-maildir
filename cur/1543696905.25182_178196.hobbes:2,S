Rsync coherence is your problem, there is nothing I can do about that,
I don't admin kernel.org.  Peter has a login on kernel.bkbits.net and
we can coordinate so he gets a coherent snapshot.  It's trivial, he
could sync the data to kernel.org at 2PM and we update the data at 2AM,
I tend to think that there won't be any coherency problems.
