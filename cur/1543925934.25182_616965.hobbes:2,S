I am the core developer of this and I am not as pessimistic as Phil. Yet I admit
Phil has been asking for this kind of kernel interface for a very very long time ;-<

I think I understand your concerns. I will work on this. I think it is possible to
refactor. It will certainly be painful (for me), but I think it can be done within
some reasonable delay. Of course, it would be help if you could better qualify what
you mean by 'smaller'.

I will start working on this once I fix the tickless/hrtimer issues.

I do care a lot actually. Believe me, I do spend a lot of effort and energy
on this project everyday, like many others around the world, and I intend for
it to succeed. We have reached a point in the development of processor hardware
where this kind of features is crucial and it is not just for HPC folks anymore.
