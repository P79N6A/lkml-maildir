I've applied this.  I've also cleaned up the class stuff some more and
converted the drivers/message/i2o/iop.c code to use the easier class and
class_device interfaces, as you should not have 2 refcounted structures
trying to control the same overall structure.  The i2o device structure
is still like this and remains to be fixed up.  If no one does it soon,
I'll clean it up too.
thanks,
