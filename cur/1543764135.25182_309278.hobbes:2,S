Limit source code lines to 80 characters (including comment lines).
+static int mcf5282_read_data():
+	if (ackType == NACK)
+		*MCF5282_I2C_I2CR |= MCF5282_I2C_I2CR_TXAK;     // generate NA
+	else
+                *MCF5282_I2C_I2CR &= ~MCF5282_I2C_I2CR_TXAK;    // 
generate ACK
The 2 assignments above should begin in the same column.
Also, kernel comment style is C /* ... */, not C++ (or C99) // style.
+        if (timeout <= 0)
+                printk("%s - I2C IIF never set. Timeout is %d \n", 
__FUNCTION__, timeout);
All printk() calls should have a KERN_WARNING or KERN_ERR or
KERN_DEBUG level used in it...
+	if (timeout <= 0 )
No space before the closing ')'.
+static int mcf5282_write_data():
+        if (timeout <=0)
should be (add a space)
+        if (timeout <= 0)
+	if (timeout <= 0 )
Drop space before ')'
Drop the debugging printk's and DEREK_DEBUG blocks.
+        switch (size) {
+                case I2C_SMBUS_QUICK:
We usually don't indent the 'case' line to save one indent level.
It helps when using 8-space tabs.
+			// this is not yet ready!!!
Put blocks like this inside
#if 0
or
#if NOT_READY_YET
#endif
blocks.
+static u32 mcf5282_func(struct i2c_adapter *adapter)
+{
+	return(I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_QUICK |
+	       I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_BYTE |
+	       I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_PROC_CALL |
+	       I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_BYTE_DATA |
+	       I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_WORD_DATA |
+	       I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_BLOCK_DATA);
+};
Don't use parens on return statements.
+static int __init i2c_mcf5282_init():
is not driver registration needed?  I don't know the I2C
subsystem, so maybe not...
Big Question:  does most Coldfire or I2C use volatile so heavily,
or is it just this one driver that does that?  Volatile here
semms very overused.
