I think that it is true not to be able to acquire file_list_lock()
that is called from file_move().

Indeed, Is there a good method of debugging this issue?
In the check on the source, a doubtful place was not found except file_kill(). 
I might call not race of fput() and the dentry_open() but
the deadlock of file_list_lock().
