To include the module in kernel sources is simple.
Let's assume it is a char driver and the module is named beware.
1) copy source to drivers/char
cp beware.c $KERNEL_SRC_DIR/drivers/char/
2) Edit makefile to include your module:
Just above the clean-files statement add:
obj-y += beware.o
And you are ready to compile the kernel with your module built-in.
May I also refer you to Linux Device Drivers volume 3 (LDD3) and to
Documentation/kbuild/* in the kernel source.
