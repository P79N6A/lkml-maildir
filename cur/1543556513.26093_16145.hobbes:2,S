It is a kernel bug.

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can't build a kernel with that compiler.  You _must_ use gcc
2.91.66 or another compiler that can compile the kernel.  Red Hat
ships gcc 2.91.66 packaged as "kgcc" for kernel builds as do
other major vendors.
You must edit the top level makefile appropriately first before
building.

The kernel doesn't use any libc so it doesn't matter.

No, you must have a different gcc on the other machines.  You
can't build a kernel with gcc 2.96 as the kernel is buggy.

If you think C++ is not overly complicated, just what is a protected
