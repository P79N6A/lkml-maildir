I think the caller must disable preemption since smp_call_function()
means "do something on all but the current cpu". If the preempt_disable
would happen only in smp_call_function() it could already be running on
a different cpu, which is not what the caller wants.
If preemption must be disabled before smp_call_function() we should have
the same semantics for all smp_call_function_* variants.
