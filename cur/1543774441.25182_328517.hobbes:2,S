Debugging patch
That e1000 error message indicates an EINVAL error code, which is from this
code:
	if ((irqflags & SA_SHIRQ) && !dev_id)
		return -EINVAL;
	if (irq >= NR_IRQS)
		return -EINVAL;
	if (!handler)
		return -EINVAL;
I don't think it's the last one, because e1000_intr (which is sent in to
request_irq() from e1000) is prototyped/defined. I spun up a patch to spit out
some debugging here which simply inserts some printks (if the only driver which
gets this warning is e1000, then it shouldn't flood your logs) -- basically
narrowing down which error condition is causing the failure. I'm guessing it's
probably the first case, but let's be sure.
