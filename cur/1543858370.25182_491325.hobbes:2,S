Hopefully someone can give me a quick answer...
Yesterday I discovered some processes that had a PPID which was not
shown as a running process by "ps".  Also an "ls /proc" did not show
that PPID.
I've Googled on this enough to find out that these are Linux threads,
that "ps -m" will show them, that "ls -a /proc" will show /proc/.PPID,
etc, but I'm still wondering what exact sequence of system calls will
create a process like this?
I'm trying to file a bug report for another piece of software and I
would like to make a simple test program that shows this situation.
Thanks,
