Can we get this converted to a mutex asap, please?
It's only used in a single place and perhaps we don't need this lock at
all?

setup_timer() could be used here.

Do we really really need one instance of kdelayd on each CPU?
I suspect a single-threaded workqueue would suffice here.  We have a big
global lock in this driver anyway....
Probably create_workqueue() should have defaulted to single-threaded on day
one.  Oh well.

We have an ugly^Wnice new KMEM_CACHE macro for this now.
What's that __alignof__ doing in there?
