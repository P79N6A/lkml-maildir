Odd that none of them just submitted a patch to fix the "real problem" then.
Sorry, I don't believe that was your only intent.

Which is bullshit - It's not political, it's a matter of support. Problems
that appeared to be VM issues, or other things, turned out to be binary
driver issues, which we can't fix, and is a total waste of our time. 
Whether you agree with what we chose to support or not is completely
immaterial - it's not your call.
