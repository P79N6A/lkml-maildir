Yes.
I believe it should just do suspend(PMSG_SUSPEND) before system
shutdown. If you think distintion between shutdown and suspend is
important (I am not 100% convinced it is), we can just add flag
saying "this is system shutdown".
Actually this patch should be in the queue somewhere... We had it in
suse trees for a long time, and IMO it can solve problem easily.
