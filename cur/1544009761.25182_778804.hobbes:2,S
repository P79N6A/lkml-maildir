VMI initialiation can relocate the fixmap, causing early_ioremap
to malfunction if it is initialized before the relocation.  The
ioremap area is low enough in virtual address space that no actual
collision occurs, however, because the pagetables for it were not
allocated under VMI mode, the pagetable updates are dropped by
the hypervisor as irrelevant, resulting in a crash on boot.

you can not move that late,
