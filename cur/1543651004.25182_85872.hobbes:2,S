Yes, we definitely need such a beast for Lustre.  Currently (because we
haven't gotten around to fixing it) we invalidate the whole file if
there is a lock conflict when we really only want to invalidate a
page or range of pages.
Our "performance" release isn't until next year - we're still working
on "performant" right now, but in the case of multiple clients writing
to non-overlapping areas in a file, or different files we're still
pretty good - abount 1.5GB/s aggregate write speed with 20 storage targets.
We have 62 storage targets in our target environment, but haven't done
a full tests because we're working on some nasty distributed metadata
bugs right now.  Since the client->target I/O is pretty much independent,
there should be no problems hitting 4.5 GB/s aggregate write speed.
Cheers, Andreas
