A single savage works just fine. This is lsmod output with X running:
Module                  Size  Used by
savage                  3520  0
drm                    62500  3 savage
Is it normal that the savage module looks unused? I can actually rmmod
the savage module while X is running. After that direct rending fails
with some error message about permissions ... reloading savage didn't
help (of course, because X wouldn't reinitialize it). A bit later the
box locked up. Is this 0 usage count and the ability to rmmod the module
while X is running specific to the savage driver or do other drivers
show the same behaviour?
Some questions about future driver development: So the new linux-core
and shared-core are the place to do new driver development? If this is
correct then it will be for 2.6 kernels only, right? I suppose there
would some back-porting effort involved in getting a future savage
driver to work with 2.4 again (like adding back all the DRM() macros).
