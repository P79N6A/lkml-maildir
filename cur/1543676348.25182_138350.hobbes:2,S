No, it did crashed in allocation code (you skipped one trace line):
Jun  5 16:53:55 admin kernel: Call Trace:    [__kmem_cache_alloc+107/304] [kmem_cache_grow+508/624] [__kmem_cache_alloc+125/304]
+[get_mem_for_virtual_node+87/224] [fix_nodes+198/1008]
And the EIP is in kmem_cache_alloc_batch, sounds like it tripped on bad pointer or something like this.
So something is corrupting slab lists it seems.
Bye,
