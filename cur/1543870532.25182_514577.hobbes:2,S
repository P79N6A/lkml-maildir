That would give you silent memory corruption in case the networking code
hold a reference after the memory gets returned to slab and reused.
We need to either stop allowing to pass slab memory to the block layer,
or document that drivers need to handle it specially and give them a
way to find out about them. (Or do the horrible slab refcounting hack
I wrote up above)
