Let's assume that
batch.completed = 5;
batch.cur = 5;
batch.next_pending = 0;

RCU_batch(1) is now 6.
next_pending is 1, rcu_process_callbacks continues without calling 
rcu_start_batch().

AFAICS: No. RCU_batch(1) is 6 and rcu_ctrlblk.batch.completed is still 
5. The test for grace period completed is

5 is before 6, thus the callbacks won't be processed.
The only write operation to rcu_ctrlblk.batch.completed is in cpu_quiet, 
after checking that the cpu bitmap is empty and under 
spin_lock(rcu_ctrlblk.state.mutex).
Thanks for looking at my patches,
