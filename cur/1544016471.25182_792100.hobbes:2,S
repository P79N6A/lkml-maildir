can you please apply the patch below and provide the output ?
That's one of the subtle differences to the 2.6.27 code, where the
counter width is fixed to 32bit, which is correct anyway as the
counter MSRs can only write the lower 32bits and sign extend bit 31
according to intel documentation.
There are more subtle changes, but this is the most obvious one.
Thanks,
