No, it was the kernel's AACRAID driver (drivers/scsi/aacraid/*). And I've 
consulted that with Mark Salyzyn who told me that it is the problem of the 
upper layers which are only zero fault tollerant and that driver con do 
nothing about it.
So as I understand it, the RAID controller did signal some error with 
respect to the inconsistency of that particular array and the upper layers 
weren't probably able to distinguish the real condition and just 
interpreted it as an error and so refused to access the device 
alltogether. But understand that this is just my way of interpreting what 
I think might have happend without any knowledge of SCSI protocol or 
functionality of the SCSI or other related layers.

No, it wasn't offline. No such messages appeared in the kernel. And if it 
would have been offlie, the kernel/driver would certainly report that, as 
I've allready witnessed such a situation in the past (however for totally 
different reason).

The BIOS of the RAID controller has this option.

That may very well be true. I do not know what the Adaptec BIOS does under 
the "Low-Level Format" option. Maybe someone from Adaptec would know that.

No, I don't think this was the case of a physically bad sectors. I think 
it was just an inconsistency of the RAID controllers metadata (or 
something simillar) related to that particular array.
