Subject: [PATCH] adjust p4 per-cpu gain
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The smt-nice handling patch is a little too aggressive by not estimating 
the per cpu gain as high enough for pentium4 hyperthread. This patch 
changes the per sibling cpu gain from 15% to 25%. The true per cpu gain 
is entirely dependant on the workload but overall the 2 species of 
Pentium4 that support hyperthreading have about 20-30% gain.
Patch for 2.6.8-rc2-mm1 attached.
Signed-off-by: Con Kolivas <kernel@kolivas.org>
P.S: Anton - For the power processors that are now using this SMT nice 
infrastructure it would be worth setting this value separately at 40%.
