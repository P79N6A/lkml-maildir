"Ha, ok, I see where you're going with this one."
This patch is perfectly suited to reduce heat at home and in the server
room, especially during kernel development and debugging, but the
average kernel usage already pays off. Just add vt.printk_color=0x08
and all your kernel messages and oopses will be printed using low-power
electrons. Extremely useful on SGI Altix 4700, which does print a lot
(number of CPU cores), or SunFire X4500 (number of disks). Even if not
using one of these systems, CKO can contribute to the lower power usage
of PetaBox™ [
