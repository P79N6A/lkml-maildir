Well, that's kind of the point. We _do_ have the stack aligned on
entrance, but it looks like gcc wants it _non-aligned_. It seems to want
it offset by the "return address push" - ie it seems to expect that it was
aligned before the "call", but entry into the next function will thus
_never_ be aligned.
So the kernel actually seems to have it _too_ aligned right now.
