The most recent version of the in-development s3fb can be obtained from
a patch against kernel 2.3.3, generated daily at
http://havoc.gtf.org/garzik/kernel/files/UNTESTED/
It currently supports Trio cards (once fully debugged), but the
framework is in place to support most if not all pre-Virge S3 cards. 
Patches and testing help are definitely welcome.
I also recently set up a linux-s3@gtf.org mailing list for anybody using
an S3 card under Linux.  Send a 'subscribe linux-s3' message to
majordomo@gtf.org to sign up.
In addition to this, you can use the more-stable vesafb.  See
linux/Documentation/fb/vesafb.txt in the kernel sources or
http://gtf.org/garzik/video/
 for more information.
