It isn't that simple.  ISDN is more than networking, and even
useable without it.  Non-network uses of isdn:
* Making an answering machine or voicemail from a pc
and one or more isdn cards.
* Use isdn for dialing into non-IP services like a BBS.
So you have a choice between sticking all networking
things in a network menu (and have stuff like ISDN
spread out in different places (network and other ISDN at least)
or put all ISDN in one plave and have network etc. spread over
various networking technologies like today.
There is no config layout that is "clean" for everybody,
because it is fundamentally trying to stuff a generic graph
into a hierarchical tree.
