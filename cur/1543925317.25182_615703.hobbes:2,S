Ok, that is fair enough and good enough reason to mark it __meminit.
It's a pity in one sense because a dead function remains in the loaded
kernel image but I can't think of a nice way around it right now.

I guess it's a question of personal taste. I am not a fan of magic numbers
because it's not clear from the call-site what "1" means. It could be a
value of 1 or a boolean true requiring that I double check the function
being called. I would have used either a #define or defined
__something() - internal to a C file
something()   - non-strict version
something_strict() - the strict version
so it's obvious from the call-site what the intention is. However, I
imagine there are people puking at that notion too.
Fix up the 4GB magic number at least so it reflects that it is DMA32 you
are talking about.
