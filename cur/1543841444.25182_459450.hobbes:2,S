Pavel knows how to submit patches to CodingStyle too.  :)

We have been tending toward not using space in cases like this
(in my unscientific memory-based survey).
So, just this morning I have seen questions and opinions about
the following that could (or could not) use more documentation
or codification and I'm sure that we could easily find more,
but do we want to codify Everything??
1.  Kconfig help text should be indented (it's not indented in the
	GFS2 patches)
2.  if (!condition1)	/* no space between ! and condition1 */
3.  don't use C99-style // comments
4.  unsigned int bitfield :<nr_bits>;
