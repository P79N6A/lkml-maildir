for security reasons it's not possible to disable exec-shield for setuid
root processes (such as X). So the solution either to upgrade X to have
the fix or to switch off exec-shield when you start up X, and switch on
exec-shield afterwards. A bit painful the later method ...
(alternatively you can also disable the setuid-root protection in the
kernel, remove the two 'current->personality = PER_LINUX' lines from
fs/exec.c and recompile the kernel.)

no. The X segmenation fault is because the X module loader malloc()s
buffers for code and expects them to be executable. Those buffers were
non-executable on other architectures already, so the fix is really simple
- a oneliner #ifdef or so.
