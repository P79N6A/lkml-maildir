Tihs is not entirely true. I'd like to point to remap_pfn_range() as a
smoothly-executed API change. All in-tree drivers were swept. Out-of-
tree open-source drivers got by with nothing more than warnings. Even
binary-only drivers had no trouble with mere recompiles of glue layers.
Many other API changes are also executed with similar smoothness.
