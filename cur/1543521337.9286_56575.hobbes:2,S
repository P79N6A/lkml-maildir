ALSA has already the same behaviour (also for OSS emulation) and the
inode lock is dropped on write (to tell you the truth I'd have preferred
that sys_write transfer the inode->i_sem handling entirely to
f_op->write, but probably the efficiency impact of the double down/up is
small)
I'm not sure to understand the second part (and one sleeping on a write
locks out the other), can you rephrase that?
