Subject: Why must NFS access metadata in synchronous mode?

Until kernel 2.6.16, I think NFS still access metadata synchronously,
which may impact performance significantly. Several years ago, paper
"metadata update performance in file systems" already suggested using
asynchronous mode in metadata access.
I am curious why NFS does not adopt this suggestion? Can someone explain this?
Thanks!
