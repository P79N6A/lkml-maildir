These days GCC is usually smart enough to automatically inline things
that are that small, it doesn't need to be explicitly labelled. If your
toolchain doesn't inline that gdrom_is_busy() implementation, get a
better toolchain.

Hey now, some of us have no intention of giving up our 80x25 consoles,
not everyone buys in to this whole newfangled X thing. ;-)
More than 80 columns is generally fine so long as it's done so tastefully
rather than arbitrarily based on a larger console width. However, if it
can be split up cleanly for 80 columns, then it should be. ie, use common
sense, rather than blindly adhering to the whims of an anal-retentive
script.
