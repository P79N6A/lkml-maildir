Nope. Can't do that.. The whole 'remove it' thread was prompted because
some improvements in 2.3 broke this and made it harder to do.
I'd suggest that we remove it in 2.3, and put warning in 2.2 at mount
time. (And per-access if the users explicitly turns it on with mount
options).
When we go to 2.4 we can decide if we have to add back in the legacy hack.
