On basically any machine we'll have multiple memory zones.
Each of those memory zones has its own free list and each
of the zones can get low on free pages independantly of the
other zones.
This means that if the VM asks to get a particular page
freed, at the very minimum you need to make a page from the
same zone freeable.

Rik
