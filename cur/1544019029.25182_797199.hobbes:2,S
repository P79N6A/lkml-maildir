No, not at all.  Patches welcome.  :-)

The current tj-percpu[1] contains Brian's commit which consolidates
load_gs_base() into switch_to_new_gdt(), so you'll either need to call
it instead or call wrmsrl() or loadsegment() directly if that doesn't
fit the bill (but I think it will).
The initial offset is different between 32 and 64.  Please take a look
at BOOT_PERCPU_OFFSET definition in setup_percpu.c.
Thanks.
