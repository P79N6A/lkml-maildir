Subject: How does get_user()/put_user() work in kernel 2.2.x?

Before kerenl 2.2.x, I knew get_user()/put_user() could access user
space using fs segment register.
But in case of kernel 2.2.x the code was changed and I can't understand
how does get_user()/put_user() can access the user space!
Is there anybody who can hack the code in <asm/uaccess.h> and
arch/i386/lib/getuser.s, putuser.s.
How does get_user() and put_user() operate to access user space in
kernel 2.2.x?
Thanks in advance
