Yes, we do need the irq-desc lock.  I'd been talking about the
interrupt controler lock.  Sorry for being imprecise.

Really?  I thought ack/end was used in the interrupt handler,
not disable/enable.  I am talking about the hw_interrupt_type
functions, not the dp264 functions of nearly the same name.

Really?  I don't see any ocurrence of those functions in 3c509.c,
nor in the net/ipv4 or net/core directories. 
I do see a use in 3c59x.c, (is that what you really meant?) in
vortex_timer, but that looks like it's used for timeout processing
e.g. for media type selection.  Which seems definitely off the
critical path.

Please show me where time-critical disable_irq happens.  I don't
understand why it is necessary.

I'll prototype some code that show you what I had in mind.

Eh.  It still seems sloppy.
