Andrew, a few comments on your trivial comments:

    > +static int tpm_atml_send(struct tpm_chip *chip, u8  *buf, size_t count)
There's still an extra space there I think.

    > +	data = kxalloc(READ_PUBEK_RESULT_SIZE, GFP_KERNEL);
When did we add kxalloc()?  And what does it do?
    > -ssize_t tpm_write(struct file * file, const char __user * buf,
    > +ssize_t tpm_write(struct file * file, const char __user *buf,
Why delete one space between * and buf but not the one between * and file?
