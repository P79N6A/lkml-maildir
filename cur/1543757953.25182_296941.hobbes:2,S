I feared as much.

I'm very sorry for that.

One hour will be enough if it does find a problem in that time,
worth a shot; but not enough to give confidence in the memory
if it does not find one, 12 hours better.  I actually wonder
whether rmap.c:483 is the best memory tester (serious answer
would be, in some cases yes, but not in all).
Do let me know.  If I can find time to rejig the debug patch
against your kernel, it would itself keep your server running,
replacing the BUG_ON by printks and safety.  But without knowing
what it will report, I can't judge how satisfactory that would
be (and it's unlikely to lead us to the final answer in one go).
