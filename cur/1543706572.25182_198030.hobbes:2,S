Linux bohr 2.6.2-rc2 #2 Sun Feb 1 18:59:26 EST 2004 i586 GNU/Linux
I got this mail, which seems to be timed to when I last umounted my
zip drive. I recall having slight problems mounting the device,
possibly since I had unplugged it a few times previously, and had to
rmmod all things related to the parallel port - parport, parport_pc,
lp, ppa, before modprobing ppa again.
