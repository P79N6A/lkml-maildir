Hi all,
I have a server that a couple of times each day squirts out messages 
about page allocation failures (python: page allocation failure. 
order:3, mode:0x20).  What's the reason for this, and could it affect 
the stability of the box?
The server that squirts these messages just crashed, for no apparent 
reason, so that's why I'm wondering.  It's a UML box.  Also, I'm 
wondering, are there any howto's for tweaking /proc settings so that the 
machine becomes more stable?  Are there any settings for increasing the 
verbosity of the kernel log so that the reason for a server crashing is 
easier to find?
Thanks in advance, and please CC me any replies :)
Regards,
Morten
