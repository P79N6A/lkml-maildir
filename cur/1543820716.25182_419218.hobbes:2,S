Heh, no, that's the original sd.c.  I just tried to keep the patch
as tiny as possible to show what is needed.  You are welcome to add
complexity to it, though.  The surrounding code is, uhm, rather interesting.

Yes, but the difficulty there is that all of the convoluted logic
seems to still be wanted to set a correct "block_sectors" value,
needed as a parameter on the final call:
    scsi_io_completion(SCpnt, good_bytes, block_sectors << 9);

Looks potentially buggy (still).
