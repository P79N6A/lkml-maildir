Yes, this is correct.  It's showed as pluginserver in the 'ps ax' output
but I've since noticed that it is simply a symlink to wine.  Of the two
wine processes, wine and wineserver, it was the wine frontend process
that was getting all of the CPU, showing 100% utilization.  Renicing the
wine process made the problem go away.
Running the exact same config on a 2.4.20 kernel uses only a few % of
the CPU.
Later,
Tom
