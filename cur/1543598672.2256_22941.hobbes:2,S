Amazing *and* unnecessarily complex.  What a bargin!  And it's still going
to consume that precious 128K even when loaded from usersapce as the driver
will still need to keep it.  And aren't you one of the Preists of Text in
/proc -- those of the belief in managing everything with 'cat' and 'vi'.

Way too damn late make that argument.  That snowball has been gaining mass
and speed for years now.  I would not recommend standing in front of it.

I stand by my original "fucking" comment :-)  I wouldn't trivialize this
"little problem".  I'm guessing this is a problem for Alphas as well.  Altho'
Digital (now Compaq) doesn't call it a Qlogic,FC -- their naming scheme is
on par with Cisco -- it doesn't have any firmware on the card.  SRM loads
firmware on it to scan for devices.  Having a machine randomly crash for no
easily detectable reason (esp. if you log to FC) is not good.  In fact,
one may not notice the problem for some time.
Dave, what kind of messages does a master abort cause?

No, you take it up with Linus (and the Qlogic maintainer) as you are the nut
removing it ... and introducing a great big question mark around the stability
of the Qlogic FC driver.
