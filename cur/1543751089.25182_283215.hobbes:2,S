Its all there in ppc64 2.6 mainline:
for i in `seq 0 127`
do
	echo XXX > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu$i/smt_snooze_delay
done
Will enable dynamic ST-SMT switching (XXX is the number of microseconds
we wait in the idle loop before sleeping the thread). Since the SMT
scheduler in 2.6 fills up primary threads first, we will keep SMT
disabled until we have enough work to do. This is probably what you are
referring to here.
To switch SMT off permanently on the fly:
for i in `seq 0 2 127`
do
	echo 0 > /sys/devices_system/cpu/cpu$i/online
done
(ie hotplug cpu disable every second thread) and to switch SMT on again:
for i in `seq 0 2 127`
do
	echo 1 > /sys/devices_system/cpu/cpu$i/online
done
Switching off SMT using either mode will give you a gain in performance
on some things, particularly single threaded stuff. The POWER5 chip
actually reconfigures itself on the fly and reallocates all the
resources to the one thread. eg on a single CPU, two thread box:
SMT enabled:
# ./lat_syscall -N 1
Simple syscall: 0.3360 microseconds
now disable SMT:
# echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online
# ./lat_syscall -N 1 null
Simple syscall: 0.2970 microseconds
