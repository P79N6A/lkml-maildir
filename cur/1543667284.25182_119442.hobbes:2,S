Linus, please do a

	[PCI] Fix incorrect PCI cache line size assumptions.
	
	Fix incorrect PCI cache line size assumptions on i386 and thus
	avoid potential memory corruption with Memory Write-and-Invalidate.
<ink@ru.rmk.(none)> (03/03/22 1.1132)
	[PCI] Make setup-bus.c aware of cardbus bridges.
	
	Comments from rmk:
	
	Make setup-bus.c properly aware of cardbus bridges.  We treat the
	bus behind a cardbus bridge more or less like any other bus, except
	we don't explicitly descend below.  We do, however, explicitly
	reserve IO and memory space as we have done in the past.  Memory
	space is doubed to 32MB as a measure to allow the Mobility
	cardbus-pci stuff to work.  The amount of space reserved is now
	specified by a couple of #defines at the top of the file.
	
	This allows pci_bus_assign_resources() and pci_bus_size_bridges()
	to be called for both root buses as well as cardbus secondary buses.
	
	Comments from Ivan follows:
	
	This patch combines your(rmk) cardbus changes (formerly pci-11)
	and my "arbitrary resource layout" stuff. This + current bk works
	on nautilus.
	
	Most interesting feature: this can be used on partially
	allocated PCI tree. For instance, i386 PCI code has always been
	absolutely helpless wrt incorrectly initialized p2p bridges.
	Now it can just call pci_assign_unassigned_resources() in the
	end of PCI init and it would fix following problems:
	- completely uninitialized bridge windows (with base and limit 0);
	- erroneously "closed" windows;
	- windows overlapping with something else.
<ink@undisclosed.(none)> (03/03/22 1.1131)
	[PCI] Don't call pci_update_resource() for bridge resources.
	  
	Minor cleanup: don't call pci_update_resource() for bridges,
	get rid of bogus "trying to set non-standard region" messages thus.
