Hi,
I have been experiencing occasional lockups with kernels 2.2.10 and
(now) 2.2.12.  In all the cases, the system locks hard -- none of the
usual tricks work from the console.  I am unable to log into the
machine remotely, but for some odd reason the machine DOES respond to
ping.   The _only_ way to recover the machine is to push the reset button.
Not a single thing is written to any of the system log files.
Does anyone have any suggestions for tracking down this problem?
The machines in question are Dell Pentium II/450 servers with SCSI
disks.   In all cases the hangs have occurred while someone was working 
at the console in X-windows.  
The systems are vanilla redhat 6 with all the relevant errata applied.  The
only other updates are to the kernel, with knfsd-1.4.7 patches installed
and the userland knfsd-1.4.7 tools upgrades.  This has happened under
both 2.2.10-ac8 and now under 2.2.12.  
Any suggestions appreciated!
thanks,
Todd Chauvin
