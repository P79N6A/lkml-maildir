[Not certain why this is in kernel list, but anyways...]
I have run into this a while back on Redhat.
Look in /etc/lilo.conf to see where lilo wants the kernel to be.  It is not always in /vmlinuz.  Sometimes it is in /boot.  (Redhat likes to call it all sorts of things as well.)
He may need to uncomment and modify the "boot=" line in /usr/src/linux/Makefile. (I know Redhat does not uncomment this line in the sources they distribute.  Not certain about SuSe.)
