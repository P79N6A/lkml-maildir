That, BTW, is perhaps the worst problem with v2 (inherited by v3).
WTF _is_ "the spirit of the license" and who gets to decide if two
licenses are in the same spirit?  As soon as we get to "well, original
authors of the license are the final authority on that", we are
in the "I've always said ..." country.
Look, humans _suck_ at revision control, especially that of our
intentions and opinions.  It doesn't even require malice, all
ancedotes about spouses/mothers-in-law/etc. nonwithstanding.
We all easily fall into belief that we had always meant what we mean
now; that even if we said something different, it was just a poor
wording; that if we had known what we know now, we would certainly
had come to the same conclusions we have come to now.
"In the same spirit" is just about the weakest requirement in that
area.  I.e. the most prone to drift, especially when one is an ideologist
and thus has severely decayed integrity to start with.  Call it a
professional disease of crystal ball users - or a prerequisite for
playing a visionary, if you will ;-/
