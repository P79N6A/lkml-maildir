What API's, and what usage?

Any LLDD's issuing requests should be doing a get/put around the request.
Any upper level drivers calling scsi_device_put() before a request
completes is likely a bug. sg has code in place to handle the
post-release/close completion of IO (IMO, a bad design).
Are any upper level drivers calling scsi_device_put() while they have
outstanding IO?
The scan code never calls upper level drivers probe functions via
device_add unless we are going to keep the scsi_device (well, there are
error paths in scsi_sysfs_add_sdev that look bad - we don't check the
result of scsi_sysfs_add_sdev). But for completeness, we could add
get/puts to the scan code.
As you pointed out, the current get_device() will never return NULL when
called via:
	get_device(&sdev->sdev_gendev)
The current code only narrows the window where problems might occur, I
don't see how it can completely avoid races with removal.
And the patch removes code from the mainline scsi IO paths.
