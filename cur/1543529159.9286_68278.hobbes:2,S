linux-2.3.50
I'm using an AHA2940u2w with a sony sdt-10000 tape drive.
I'm using aic7xx, st, and scsi_mod as modules.
The first time the modules are loaded, by using
mt rewind
for example, it seems to work, but an error is returned Input/Output
error.  A subsequent try will return with no error.
I don't know if this problem is new to 2.3.50 or not.  Is there any
way to fix it?
