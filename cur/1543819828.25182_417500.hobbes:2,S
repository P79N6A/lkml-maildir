OK.

Sure, we can leave things like that until later.

I should have said "testing for regressions".  We know that smpnice
improves some things.  My concern is that it doesn't cause any non-silly
workloads to worsen.  Once we're at that stage I think we're ready to go.
IOW: at this stage we should concentrate upon not taking any workloads
backwards, rather than upon taking even more workloads even more forwards. 
That can come later.

Sure.  A mortal doesn't have the hardware and isn't set up to test certain
high-value workloads...

Sure.  "same or better" is the aim here.
