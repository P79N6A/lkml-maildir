if SCHED_OTHER is the goal, then the xruns you are seeing in the
fluidsynth test are likely the result of random fluctuations in
scheduling of SCHED_OTHER tasks.
The way to find out whether that's the main source of xruns would be the
following test: start each fluidsynth instance as "nice -19 fluidsynth
..." to renice it to +19. Nice +19 gives the smoothest timeslices to
CPU-bound tasks (such as fluidsynth), and should give the smallest
global fluctuations. (The system must be idle during the test of course,
a nice +19 task is easily preempted.)
