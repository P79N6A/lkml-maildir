Hummm.... these symbols should only go in if you config KALLSYMS_ALL. 
Are you sure your configuration doesn't have KALLSYMS_ALL enabled?
If it does, it seems like the correct behavior to include all symbols if 
you specified that you wanted _all_ symbols :)
By the way, there is a completely different version of 
scripts/kallsyms.c in -mm that you might want to look at. It will 
probably go in after 2.6.13 is out.
