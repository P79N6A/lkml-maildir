Hi,
I try to boot linux-2.6.4 from OpenFirmware on my Apple iBook2 (dual 
USB). I'm using the image named "vmlinux.elf-pmac". While linux-2.4.25 
boots fine, linux-2.6.4 doesn't without the following modifications:
http://membres.lycos.fr/schaffner/howto/linux26-boot-of.txt
(I found this procedure by trial and error, by mixing stuff from 2.4 
into the build of 2.6.)
If I try to boot the stock kernel, OpenFirmware tells me "Claim 
failed", and returns to the command prompt.
Does anybody have an idea what is the cause of this?
Thanks,
Martin
