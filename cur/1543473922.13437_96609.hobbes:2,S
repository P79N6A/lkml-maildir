what is with the vfat code in pre3?
it says my win98 created fat32 partition does not contain a valid ms-dos 
partition, 2.2.0pre1 was the last kernel which handles my partitions properly.
pre3's error messages:
Jan  2 18:33:31 mithrandir kernel: fat_read_super: Bad fsinfo_offset
Jan  2 18:33:31 mithrandir kernel: VFS: Can't find a valid MSDOS filesystem on 
dev 03:03.
after 5 minutes of uptime with pre3, i also started getting ext2 warnings and
errors when my updatedb cron jobs kicked in.
rebooting and fscking with pre1 detected no errors on the ext2 partition, so
i guess a lot of spurious warnings are being generated.
hope it gets fixed soon...
