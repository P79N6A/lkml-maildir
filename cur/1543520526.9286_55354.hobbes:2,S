I see someone else has told you how to get at the payloads.  If you want
to know how specific fields and values are stored, get a copy of RFC2616
and start writing a parser... HTTP is text based, so you have to parse a
series of tokens to extract data; this is totally different from TCP and
IP which pass values in binary form in fixed locations.
I haven't yet looked at khttpd's parser but that might be a good place to
start looking at how an in-kernel context should examine HTTP headers.
