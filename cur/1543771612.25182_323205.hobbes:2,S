Thanks, I'll add this to the git stuff, and next kernel release will have 
a proper shortlog.
Btw, it shows how broken your merge script is: you don't fill in the 
AUTHOR field properly for some reason:
 <jgarzik@pretzel.yyz.us>:
  Automatic merge of /spare/repo/netdev-2.6 branch r8169-fix
  Automatic merge of /spare/repo/linux-2.6/.git branch HEAD
  Automatic merge of /spare/repo/netdev-2.6 branch use-after-unmap
  Automatic merge of rsync://rsync.kernel.org/.../torvalds/linux-2.6.git branch HEAD
but "committer" is right. Pls fix.
