From practical point of view - yes some of that processes are complex
enough to not attract attention as async usage model.
But I'm absolutely for the scenario, when several operations are 
performed asynchronously like open+stat+fadvice+sendfile.
By IO I meant something which has end result, and that result must be
enough to start async processing - data in the buffer for example.
Async open I would combine with actual data processing - that one can be
a one event.
