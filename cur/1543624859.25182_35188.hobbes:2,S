Very true.
With all recent kernels, init exiting causes the last of these to trigger:
NORET_TYPE void do_exit(long code)
{
        struct task_struct *tsk = current;
        if (in_interrupt())
                panic("Aiee, killing interrupt handler!");
        if (!tsk->pid)
                panic("Attempted to kill the idle task!");
        if (tsk->pid == 1)
                panic("Attempted to kill init!");
It is this very test that Alt-SysRQ-L is attempting to bypass which causes
the problem.
