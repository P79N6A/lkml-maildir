Oleg is working on some patches which will permit us to cancel or wait upon
a particular work_struct, rather than upon all pending work_structs.  
This will fix the problem where we accidentlly wait upon some unrelated
work_struct which takes a lock which is related to one which we already
hold.
I hope.  It'll be a bit tricky to implement: if some foreign work_struct is
running right now, we cannot wait upon it - we must non-blockingly dequeue
the work_struct which we want to kill before it gets to run.
