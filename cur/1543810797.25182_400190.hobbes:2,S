Maybe add this:
You can also take the "Code:" <object code> and feed it as bytes into a
.S (assembly) source file, assemble that, then objdump the .o file.
This is especially useful if the "Code:" line is one of the best clues
that you have.  Andi Kleen has a script for doing this.  It's called
'decodecode' and it's available from
ftp://ftp.firstfloor.org/pub/ak/shell/decodecode
