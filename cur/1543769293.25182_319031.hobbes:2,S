I'd be inclined to think that this is more of a terminfo issue.  If you
want your terminal to reset into UTF-8, use a terminfo entry with the
appropriate command string instead of the current one - this would be
the 'rs1' capability:
  rs1=\Ec\E]R
That's reset console to default, reset palette.

There's no standard way to represent this in userspace.  But yeah.
