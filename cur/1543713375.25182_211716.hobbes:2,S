Hi, is my brain going yolky? I have perm problems with a scanner after
each boot, and have to manually locate the scanner in /proc/bus/usb then
chmod it.
My fstab has:
none /proc/bus/usb usbfs defaults,devmode=0666 0 0
It happens with 2.6.3 through to .5. Am I doing something wrong or is
usbfs+devmode a bit under the weather?
Or maybe I shouldn't be using usbfs? Is it being depreciated?
