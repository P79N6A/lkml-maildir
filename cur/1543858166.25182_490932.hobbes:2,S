Hello,
  I am running an experiment with Postgrey to delay (for 300 seconds
minimum) incoming emails.   If the clients don't retry after this
delay, then the messages don't usually get in.
The "postgrey" in question is the very same thing that exists for
the Postfix MTA with various automatic whitelistings of repeatedly
successfull senders, etc.
I do already see spammers smart enough to retry addresses from
the zombie machine, but that share is now below 10% of all emails.
My prediction for next 200 days is that most spammers get the clue,
but it gives us perhaps 3 months of less leaked junk.
