Subject: ps is slow with large files_max

On a system with 8gb ram, and 35000 for files_max setting, with ~23000
allocated, ps -ef or ps aux, top, etc, are very very slow to display. Is
there something I can do to speed this up? No other negative problems
have been seen. 
System is Dell 6650 8gb Ram quad P4 Xeon 1.6ghz. TIA
