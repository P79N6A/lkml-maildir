Maybe a solution would be to have a dma_penalty option on boot? The dma 
penalty is added to the dma zone. If its higher than zero then the dma 
zone will become a node at that distance to other nodes.
The default is zero which would leave it as is.
If you boot with
	dma_penalty=40
then a new slit entry is generated for the DMA zone and its put at that 
distance.
