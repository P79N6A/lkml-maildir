This is a VERY bad idea.  If you would take a look at linux/time.h at the code 
to convert jiffies<->timeval/timespec you will see some very long expressions. 
This code is FAST but only because of constants which allow gcc to do most of 
the work at compile time.  If you change CLOCK_TICK_RATE this will NOT be true 
and a lot of work will be done at run time.  It might be instructive to compile 
one of these conversions and look at the cpp output.  Last time I looked it was 
about 1/2 page of wall to wall expression which reduces to one MPY and shift (or 
there about).
