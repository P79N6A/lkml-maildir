I disagree. The code in question is GPL code from a GPL driver or three that
was used internally in those drivers. It is now available for those drivers
to share. If you aren't writing a GPL module you can go write your own 
version of it, just like people have always had to before. 
Similarly the PAE/non-PAE thing is a red herring. Given that even basic
data types change size on pae no module is going to be magically pae/non-pae
clean if its binary only.
