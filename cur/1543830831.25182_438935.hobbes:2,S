Some IPI handlers issue irq_enter() to bump hard_irq_count, some IPI
handlers do not.  It is inconsistent, with no obvious reason for doing
it either way.  All the external irqs go via do_IRQ which does issue
irq_enter().  I guess that my real question is why are some IPIs not
using irq_enter()?  The lack of consistency concerns me.
