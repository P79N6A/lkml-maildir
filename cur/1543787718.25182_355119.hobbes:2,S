I have a similar problem:
It's a corruption while reading data from the HDD into the cache.
The affected page will contain (pseudo?)random data in the first four
bytes (at least on my system it did).
If you waited long enough, the cache page would be discarded and the next
read from the disk would be correct. However, if it happens e.g. in an
inode block, the corruption may find it's way to the disk and/or fubar
your data.
This happens mostly if there are concurrent DMA transfers like playing
sound or watching TV on bttv cards. I'm affected by the later cause,
setting no_overlay reduced it.
