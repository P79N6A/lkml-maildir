Completely misses the point.  THe point isn't about slavery, come on, Adam,
it's about putting unenforceable things into contracts.
It's also about the concept of boundaries - if you think that that 
concept is not a legal one then why aren't all programs which are run
on top of a GPLed kernel then GPLed?
