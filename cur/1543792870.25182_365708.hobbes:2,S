That's fine with me. However, it was the only way for me to test the HPET code... It's not enabled anyway by default, but if you want the whole hack go away that's fine with me.

This I added only for the purpose of not affecting existing code in existing configurations. If the code is generally acceptable, then I'll be more than happy to convert it.

As above, I introduced this only to not affect existing code. If the added latency is no problem, then of course only the overflow safe code path should be kept, and then debugger_jiffies is completely unnecessary.

Good to know, I didn't notice that. The conditional was so that the reset TSC would be considered a rolled-over one, resulting in a huge number of lost ticks.
>The union in vxtime_data is ugly - can it be avoided?
Yes, if the whole code is to become overflow-safe, then it'll just need to be a 64-bit field.
