Hrm... there is some problem in communication here. I asked you which
controller out of the 3 OHCIs you have in this machine is the culprit,
you give me a list of all of them but without PCI IDs ... From the
archive, I think it was USB bus #4 no ? not sure which of these
controllers it matches. 
The iBook G4 has actually 3 "Apple" OHCI's in KeyLargo/Intrepid but with
2 of them disabled by the firmware (not wired) plus one NEC USB2
controller (which contains 1 EHCI and 2 OHCIs) on the PCI bus. The code
managing their sleep process is very different.
Ben.
