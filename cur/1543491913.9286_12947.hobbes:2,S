Backup your old config file (.config under linux directory) and put
it back after applying patch or new src installation. Don't forget to
run make xconfig and save. But if old config option_flags are't
recognised, you have to manually fix them in .config file or
regenerate a new .config

SUBJ: Upgrading configuration files: HOW?
Dear folks,
I'm often in the situation of compiling a new kernel, and I want to
use the settings from before, but also to be aware of new options. 
What I would like to do is to be able to run make xconfig on an
updated config file; I don't want to go through and make all the same
changes by hand, but I also don't want to lose the new options.  I
want to be able to interactively edit the new configuration.
Do I use make oldconfig for this?  How?
