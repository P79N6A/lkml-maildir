In most cases, the reiserfs writepage func is the same as block_write_full_page.  The only difference should come when a packed tail has been mmap'd.
Since JOURNAL_MAX_BATCH was at 100, the log should have only pinned 400k.  More blocks could be pinned, but kreiserfsd should be in the process of flushing those.
I've been trying out a few things to send memory pressure down to reiserfs, but they have mostly been based on the code to make fs/buffer.c use writepage for flushing.  I should have done something simple first, I'll start on that now.
