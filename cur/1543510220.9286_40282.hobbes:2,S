Hi,
We're running linux 2.2.10 and linux 2.2.12 on various servers here.
The problem is that, from time to time, some of the servers crash.
The biggest problem of all is that we do not know the reason for
the crash, the kernel produces no output, the screen is blank, no
keyboard, no network, no nothing.
Since using kernel 2.2.0 and above, only in two cases has a kernel
panic resulted in the display of an error message. Unfortunately
this was not logged to file, the stack backtrace was greater than
25 lines, making the report unusable.
I would like to find the answer to our problems, as these server
problems are not rare. But since these problems only occur on
live systems, what's the best way to go about trying to tackle
this ?
Regards,
Nick.
