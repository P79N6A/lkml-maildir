Flashing keyboard lights is far simpler compared to a printk. Printk is too 
heavy. Once a system is unstable, it's more important to run into kgdb code 
asap. Calling printk and co may be too much.

Flashing keyboard lights is easy on x86 and x86_64 platforms. Is that easy on 
ppc workstations/servers? Embedded boards don't have keyboards.
