Would be nice but I don't have serial logging available at this point.
I may be able to set it up in a couple of days though.

I am aware of slow responses normally during tests. However the audio
test should only use one CPU out of two. The other CPU is busy as well
with a cpu burner (nice 10) but that should leave me CPU cycles
to move the mouse, swap windows, etc.  The "lock up" I saw this time
was a lot more severe (no mouse motion for several minutes at a time).
I knew the system was still running since the audio continued to play.
I'll try another build in the morning with whatever your latest is.
