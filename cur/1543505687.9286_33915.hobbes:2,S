Hi,
   I was encoding a set of wav files to mp3 using bladeenc, after
   running some networking experiments. Switched to top to get a kick
   out of seeing two processors full at work, and noticed that klogd
   was taking up 99.7% of the time (bladeenc was running at 99.8 %,
   presumably on the other processor). I could not determine what
   klogd was doing, though.  Killed it with a -1 and restarted it. (Is
   that the right way to do it ?)
   Configuration: 
   Base system debian 2.1
   Kernel 2.2.10
   Hardware: ABit BP6, Dual Celeron 466, 128MB. 
   By the way: can anybody point me at some smp aware tools: I'd like
   to see how the load is distributed between processors etc.
   TimT.
