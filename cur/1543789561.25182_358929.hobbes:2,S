   Nope, it breaks with a current git-2.6.14.  Here's what my extra
printk says:
Node 0: 0xe000074104e67200
Node 1: 0xe000082080722000
Node 2: 0xe000000101532000
Placing software IO TLB between 0x74108e68000 - 0x7410ce68000
So same scenario as on -mm w/ the iterating across nodes, but now
alloc_bootmem_low_pages() doesn't catch us in the end.  This will fail
in any case where MAX_DMA_ADDRESS is 4GB and every node has memory
sufficient for the swiotlb size above 4GB.  Thanks,
	Alex
