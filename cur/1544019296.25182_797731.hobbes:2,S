Yeah its about being explicit that you intended there to be an empty
statement in this construct.  We tend to get bitten even more by if form
of this:
	if (foo);
		something();
But we catch them all.  And always remember if you really think it looks
better or makes more sense one way and checkpatch is upset you can
ignore checkpatch.  It is advice on what will be accepted not
necessarily the final arbiter.  That is the maintainers role, checkpatch
is a tool to help you.
