Ah sorry, here is a refreshed version
The selection of many CPU architecture families causes pentium pro memory
ordering errata workarounds to be enabled. This causes memory barriers and
spinlocks to become much more expensive, just to provide a few hacks for a very
rare (nowadays) class of system.
Just print a warning if such a machine is detected. Also suggest a new CONFIG option that can be enabled to support such CPUs.
This saves nearly 1KB of icache in mm/ alone.
