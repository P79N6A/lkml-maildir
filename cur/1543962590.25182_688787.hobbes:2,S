OK, -mm is generally more suited for this usage then.

No, it is just to gain more exposure by easing tester's job. People
packaging distros for embedded systems do a lot of R&D, and having
new features to experiment with is very important to them. And no,
that does not mean they'll immediately use it in production. And
even if some did, they would know why they did it and it's their
problem.
