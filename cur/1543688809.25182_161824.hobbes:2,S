You can avoid walking the whole hash table.  Instead of this:
     (page, offset) -> list of futexes at (p,o)
You can use a two-level map like this:
     (page) -> (offset) -> list of futexes at (p,o)
Or you can use two one-level maps, like this:
     (page) -> list of futexes at (p)
     (page, offset) -> list of futexes at (p,o)
Either of these gives you the list of futexes give then page in
O(list_size).  They also mean you don't need the page->flags bit to
get O(1) for a page with no futexes, but it's probably a good
optimisation anyway.
