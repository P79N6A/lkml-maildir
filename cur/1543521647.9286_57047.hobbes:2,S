Hi, I am Daiki Matsuda and belongin to Kondara MNU/Linux Project
(
http://www.kondara.org/
). So, I take charge of kernel packages in it,
I made the patch to be enabling to using 2.3.39 USB driver to
2.2.14. And I will send it. There is a typofix in its patch.
If you want to it, you shoud take drivers/usb, linux/include/input.h
and linux/include/videodev.h. The kernel 2.2.14 has videodev.h, but I
understood it will be upper compatible. But I could not modify 3 sources. So please not to configure
 [ ]   Preliminary USB device filesystem
 [ ]     USB SCSI verbose debug
 < >   USS720 parport driver
Regards
Daiki Matsuda
