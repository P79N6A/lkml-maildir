Why not make a crappy GPL driver that just export again
the symbols ?
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
pci_bus_read_config_byte_binary (....)
{
pci_bus_read_config_byte(...)
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL(pci_bus_read_config_byte_binary);
[...]
Also why as an embeded company I can't remove the licence check in the
kernel I provide to my custommers.
No software tricks could force the company to use GPL because GPL allows
you to remove or short-cut these tricks.
Only the law can do something about softwares that don't comply to GPL
license...
It would be great if big companies that use Linux (OSDL, IBM, ...)
proposes a poll of lawyers which could do something like gpl-violations
(check if some softwares violate the GPL, if yes contact the copyright
holders, and if the developpers accept represent them).
