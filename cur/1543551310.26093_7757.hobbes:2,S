Ughhh, of course ... this comes into __alloc_pages(), which
finds a page with some flags set on the free list ... this
backtrace - of course - isn't helpful in debugging the thing, 
sorry for wasting your time...
[off to find other ways of finding this problem ... note that
__free_pages_ok() does the SAME BUG() check before putting the
page on the free list]
regards,
Rik
