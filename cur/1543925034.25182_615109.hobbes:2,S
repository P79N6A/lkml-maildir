Subject: [PATCH] frv: Remove bogus NO_IRQ = -1 define
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The old NO_IRQ define some platforms had was long ago declared obsolete
and wrong. FRV should therefore not be re-introducing this, especially as
IRQs are usually unsigned in the kernel. The "no IRQ" case is defined to be
zero and Linus made this rather clear at the time.
arch/frv shows no dependancy on this but it might show up driver fixes
needing doing I guess
