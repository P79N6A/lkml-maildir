Look, I'm not paid to do tech support for you, so there is nothing for
me to gain in trying to give you the runaround.  The orinoco driver is
designed to make hard hangs very unlikely, even at the expense of a
greater chance of the driver operation falling over, so that was by
best initial guess at the problem - albeit possibly a hurried and
inaccurate one (see below).

Hmm... yes, I suppose so.  How odd.

Well, one of the main features of the driver is that the Tx path and
the interupt handler (Rx path) are permitted to run concurrently.
This is an issue even on UP (although not as complex), since the Rx
patch can interrupt the Tx path.  I believe there has been at least
some successful operation on SMP machines, but unfortunately I don't
know any details.
