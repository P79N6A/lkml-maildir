In the initial patch I made a typo.  As Pekka Enberg pointed out, with 
the if still following the else, you can still get a null uid written to 
the disk if you specify a default uid= without uid=forget.  In other 
words, if the desktop user is uid=1000 and the mount option uid=1000 is 
given ( which is done on ubuntu automatically and probably other 
distributions that use hal ), then if any other user besides uid 1000 
owns a file then a 0 will be written to the media as the owning uid 
instead.  This is exactly what the original patch was trying to prevent.
