Aha ok, so that when (at least one) cpu is busy then I can count on
jiffies incrementing via do_timer, can't I ?
So that I'd remove the loop limit altogether but limiting it to
1 or 2 jiffies to prevent livelock.
Like
max_jiff = jiffies+2; /* not +1 at we could be at +0.9999 now */
while (jiffies<max_jiff) do_hard_potentionaly_long_work();
if (more_work) schedule_to_next_jiffie();
This will keep event queue work load under 66% of system load which
seems reasonable to me.
Would you accept such solution ?
