That seems like a lot of pages for a small race, it feels like we have a
bigger problem.  If nobody else has ideas, and you've got an available
disk for mkreiserfs, could I talk you into trying with reiserfs
data=ordered?
ftp.suse.com/pub/people/mason/patches/data-logging/experimental/2.6.4
(use series.mm for a list of files to apply to 2.6.5-rc-mm)
data=ordered is the default with those patches, so just mkreiserfs and
mount.  reiserfs is using a different writepage and different code to
submit the ordered buffers, so you'll be using completely different code
paths.
I'll try to get some time on an 8way here for some tests as well.
