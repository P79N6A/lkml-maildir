Hello,
After some looking into your code, I think there is a bug.
Please correct me if I'm wrong.
The problem occur when awake processes which wait for message (or free
space). I think that your code will wake them up in random order. POSIX
says:
> If more than one thread is waiting to send when space becomes
> available in the message queue and the Priority Scheduling option is
> supported, then the thread of the highest priority that has been
> waiting the longest shall be unblocked to send its message
I've written a test and it shows that my suspects are rather true?
BTW: I've had some problems with your patch when linking kernel - in your
main file were used static functions from msg.c?? Maybe my patch (taken
from lkml - post date: XI 10) was incomplete? If there is more recent
version could you inform me? Thanks.
Regards
K. Benedzyczak
