My bug-spotting rate doesn't seem so good lately.  But if the thing doesn't
break the kernel when configged off then sure, let's put it in -mm with a
big doesnt-work-yet warning on it and hopefully some clever person like
Chuck will come along and fix it.
That being said, we don't seem to be getting a lot of value from
DEBUG_PAGEALLOC any more.  I guess we fixed a pile of long-standing
problems when it first went in and the reintroduction rate is low.
