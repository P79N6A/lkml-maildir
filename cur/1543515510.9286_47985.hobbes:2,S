Hello:
I have a computer here that has IRQ line shared between RTC
and a PCI slot (which I need to put 3C905 into).
Can an kernel wizard out there tell me how difficult it would
be to replace request_irq(.. SA_INTERRUPT ... NULL) with
request_irq(.. SA_SHIRQ ... &rtc_something); ?
There is a comment in rtc.c which says 
/*
 *      A very tiny interrupt handler. It runs with SA_INTERRUPT set,
 *      so that there is no possibility of conflicting with the
 *      set_rtc_mmss() call that happens during some timer interrupts.
 *      (See ./arch/XXXX/kernel/time.c for the set_rtc_mmss() function.)
 */
Also, the interrupt handler seem to count interrupts in rtc_irq_data.
This can later be read from /dev/rtc. Obviously a flood of Ethernet
interrupts will screw that. What application does read /dev/rtc?
AFAIK hwclock does get/set ioctls only...
