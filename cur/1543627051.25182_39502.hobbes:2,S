Right, but (as far as I know) 2.4.19-pre6 is not considered the "stable linux
kernel", is it?  So how could 2.4.19-pre5-ac3 be the latest -ac patch to the
stable linux kernel?  It's more like "the latest -ac patch to the latest
prepatch for the stable linux kernel".
What I'm really complaining about is that for people who don't like to use 
-pre kernels (like me), finger@finger.kernel.org is useless for finding out 
what the latest -ac patch is to a non-pre kernel.
What would be nice is something like this:
The latest -ac patch to the stable Linux kernels is:        2.4.18-ac3
The latest -ac pre-patch to the stable Linux kernels is:    2.4.19-pre5-ac3

Of course he is.  I don't see what this has to do with anything I've said,
however.
