It could work differently from that.  For example, if we had 500M
total, we map 200M, then we do 400M of IO.  Perhaps we'd like to be
able to say that a 400M page cache is too big.  The problem isn't
about reclaiming pagecache it's about the cost of swapping pages back
in.  The page cache can tend to favor swapping mapped pages over
reclaiming it's own pages that are less likely to be used.  Of course,
it doesn't know that...which is the rub.
If I thought I had an method for doing this, I'd write code to try it
out.

The requirement is that we'd like to see pages aged more gracefully.
A mapped page that is used continuously for ten minutes and then left
to idle for 10 minutes is more valuable than an IO page that was read
once and then not used for ten minutes.  As the mapped page ages, it's
value decays.

I've read the source for where swappiness comes into play.  Yet I
cannot make a statement about what it means.  Can you?
