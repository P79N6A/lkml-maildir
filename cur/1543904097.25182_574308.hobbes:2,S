Since when did linux-usb-devel decide stylistic nits of the rest of the
kernel? Let them do what they want in drivers/usb, I have a hard time
accepting that what someone arbitrarily decides they want to do in their
directory suddenly blanketly applies to the rest of the kernel, and
therefore warrants a CodingStyle update.
Perhaps CodingStyle can start being versioned, so people can opt out of
certain 'improvements' whenever someone has a vision, much like some
nameless licenses.
Personally I prefer the second style, and if there's a comment block,
then it makes sense to complete the tree with {}'s (the keyword here is
prefer, as it's a personal preference). checkpatch has been quite useful
for catching obviously broken things, and now it seems like it's just
overreaching. Perhaps this functionality can be split in to a lite
checkpatch for catching show-stoppers for application and then something
more akin to a CodingStyle validator for the folks interested in
arbitrarily defining convention, which they can use freely while the rest
of us try to get something useful done.
