Hi,
The last two patches from this series are intended to address the problem that
some drivers allocate a lot of memory in their .suspend() routines causing
swsusp to fail (and generally may want to do some things that shouldn't be
done in .suspend()/.resume()).
The first one is a fix.
Greetings,
Rafael
