That BIOS setup tool might just use asynchronous I/O for anything,

Did you check your cable length and termination? You need exactly two
terminators, one at each end of the cable. None in between. Note that
the host adaptor does not get terminated if you connect two cables to
it.

Do you have a different machine with null-modem or something? You could
copy your syslog/klog output there, or you could send it to a different
host in your LAN.
