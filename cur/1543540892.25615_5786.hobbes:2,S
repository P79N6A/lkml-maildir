well I have the same Problem (I just mount under Solaris with -o vers=2
;) )
What exactly happens:
Lets say I have mounted some NFSV3 from Linux on Solaris:
# mount xyz:/export/test /mnt
Now let's go in some subdirectory:
# cd /mnt/x/y/z
Now let's do a pwd
# pwd
/x/y/z
Notize that the answer is /x/y/z!
On the Linux-side I get:
Aug  6 18:18:20 worf kernel: nfsd Security: /// bad export.
On the Solaris-side I get nothing.
Programs relying on information about pwd are'nt affected in any way.
(Unfortunately cvs is!)
Hope this describes the Problem a bit better.
Here is a snoop-output from Solaris-side:
relax# snoop rpc nfs between worf relax
Using device /dev/hme (promiscuous mode)
relax -> worf         NFS C GETATTR3 FH=000A
        worf -> relax NFS R GETATTR3 OK
relax -> worf         NFS C ACCESS3 FH=000A (lookup)
        worf -> relax NFS R ACCESS3 OK (lookup)
relax -> worf         NFS C GETATTR3 FH=CB17
        worf -> relax NFS R GETATTR3 OK
relax -> worf         NFS C GETATTR3 FH=6143
        worf -> relax NFS R GETATTR3 OK
relax -> worf         NFS C GETATTR3 FH=9C53
        worf -> relax NFS R GETATTR3 OK
Here: cd'ed into the directory
relax -> worf         NFS C GETATTR3 FH=6143
        worf -> relax NFS R GETATTR3 OK
relax -> worf         NFS C GETATTR3 FH=CB17
        worf -> relax NFS R GETATTR3 OK
relax -> worf         NFS C GETATTR3 FH=000A
        worf -> relax NFS R GETATTR3 OK
relax -> worf         NFS C GETATTR3 FH=000A
        worf -> relax NFS R GETATTR3 OK
relax -> worf         NFS C GETATTR3 FH=000A
        worf -> relax NFS R GETATTR3 OK
This was the pwd.
The next snoop is between Solaris<->Solaris machine:
relax# snoop rpc nfs between converse relax
Using device /dev/hme (promiscuous mode)
relax -> converse     NFS C NULL3
    converse -> relax NFS R NULL3 
relax -> converse     NFS C FSINFO3 FH=008C
    converse -> relax NFS R FSINFO3 OK
relax -> converse     NFS C GETATTR3 FH=008C
    converse -> relax NFS R GETATTR3 OK
relax -> converse     NFS C ACCESS3 FH=008C (lookup)
    converse -> relax NFS R ACCESS3 OK (lookup)
relax -> converse     NFS C ACCESS3 FH=008C (read)
    converse -> relax NFS R ACCESS3 OK (read)
relax -> converse     NFS C READDIRPLUS3 FH=008C Cookie=0 for 1048/8192
    converse -> relax NFS R READDIRPLUS3 OK 3 entries (No more)
relax -> converse     NFS C ACCESS3 FH=CC36 (lookup)
    converse -> relax NFS R ACCESS3 OK (lookup)
Till here the cd.
relax -> converse     NFS C PATHCONF3 FH=CC36
    converse -> relax NFS R PATHCONF3 OK
relax -> converse     NFS C LOOKUP3 FH=CC36 ..
    converse -> relax NFS R LOOKUP3 OK FH=008C
relax -> converse     NFS C GETATTR3 FH=008C
    converse -> relax NFS R GETATTR3 OK
This was the pwd.
