finally! I was surprised that it took so long before someone made objection to 
this.
I agree that interpreting brightness as command isn't nice. But what other 
options do I have?
  a) Do not use led subystem, and do everything on my own
  b) Do not allow user to change state of leds on this device
  c) Extend led subsystem to have something like command. But it is in 
contradiction with desired simplicity of led sybsystem.
  d) Control leds via force feedback effect
  e) Make 4 leds available and use brightness 0 for off and 255 for on. But only 
one of them can be active at one time. And I'll give up some flashing effects.
Well actually I don't like this options. Any suggestions? Thanks!
Jan
