good point! Maybe we can pick random signed chars in a 4k block and
guarantee their sum is always -123456. Would that be secure against
plaintext attack right? It's more like a checksum than a magic number,
but it should be a lot more secure than the "double" typo probability
(and this way the password will be asked only once during resume).
Generating those random numbers will not be the easiest thing though.
