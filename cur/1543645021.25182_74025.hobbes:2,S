> Ahh return of the 9835 =) This POS never goes away...
Just curions, what does POS mean here? :)
These "ST Lab" 2S1P cards are the only kind of PCI I/O card that I was
able to find here at a reasonable price (about $25), and it took me
quite some time to find a company that actually sells them (in stock,
not only in the price list - but if asked, "maybe in two weeks" for 3
months now...).  In general, it is difficult to buy anything non-USB
here at reasonable (not "industrial PC") prices.  Without these cards,
I'd have to buy USB hubs and USB/serial converters instead...
The patch fixes a bug for _all_ PCI parallel+serial cards, and does
not add NM9835 support yet (I'd like to submit that next - I would
really like to see it in the standard kernel).
Thanks,
Marek
