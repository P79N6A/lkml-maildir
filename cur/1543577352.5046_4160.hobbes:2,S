Rik,
It looks like this patch goes further than syncing with xfree 4.0.2, but syncs
with the dri trunk instead.  There has been a version bump in the mga drm
module on the dri trunk to add a 'blit' ioctl.  XFree 4.0.2 will barf on this.
As a broader question:  All our version checking (in client drivers and DDX
drivers) check
	found major == expected major
	found minor == expected minor 
	found patch >= expected patch
and if they don't receive this, they refuse to play.
As I understood it, the major number is bumped on backwards-incompatible
changes, the minor number on backwards-compatible changes and the patch on all
other changes, though in practise never.
Thus, wouldn't the appropriate test be:
	found major == expected major
	found minor >= expected minor
	(no test on patch)
This seems to match the semantics of the 3 numbers better?
Keith
