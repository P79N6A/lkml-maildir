I've just released a new version of the dietHotplug package.  It can be
found at:
	
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/linux-hotplug/diethotplug-0.3.tar.gz
or:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/diethotplug-0.3.tar.gz
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/diethotplug-0.3.tar.bz2
Changes since the last release:
	- added support for IEEE1394 hotplug devices.  This hasn't been
	  tested very well due to my lack of devices.  Testing is
	  welcome :)
	- moved the library files that hotplug needed from dietlibc into
	  the release tree.  This removes the external dependency on
	  dietlibc.  I have only tested the i386 arch build.  People
	  with different architectures are encouraged to test and send
	  me patches for where I messed up the build process for their
	  machines.
	- now tries to load _all_ modules that match the signature of
	  the inserted device.  Previously only the first found one
	  would be loaded, which is a bad thing for some drivers (mostly
	  pci drivers.)  This fixes a number of reported problems from
	  different users.
thanks,
greg k-h
