Does this also apply to the 2.0.37-pre-series? (My card also works fine with 2.0.37pre7.)
Actually, the volume of the OPL-3 is correct, and, compared to it, the AD1848 is very
silent even when I turn the mixer up to 100%. Moreover, I experienced the same with the
commercial OSS driver (demo) for 2.2.0pre7...
