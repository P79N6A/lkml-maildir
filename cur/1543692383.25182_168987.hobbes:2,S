Scanning through the file descriptor tables of processes does not catch
every opened file out there.  For trivial example consider attaching an
open file to SCM_RIGHTS datagram and sending it to yourself.  Then close
the original descriptor.   Later you will be able to receive the datagram
and get your opened file back.
