Ok, I'll try to grab -30-7 and work on from there. I am working on
variable dependency chains (locking tree depth). I'll try to send it as a
patch to -30-7. But I must admit it is very hard for me to follow
all your patches, getting them down, compiling etc: Once I am up
running on the newest version you have already sent out the next! :-)
