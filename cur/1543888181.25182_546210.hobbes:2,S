There is if the main clocksource has some issues where it can't be used.
On x86 there are lots of different issues with the clocks, so they have
to get switches once in a while. For instance, if the TSC changes
frequencies then it can't be used, or if the TSC stops in different
power states , it can't be used.. 
Anything like that on PowerPC?
