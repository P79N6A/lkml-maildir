In fact, I want to avoid a similar solution: MIDI over SCSI.  There are
some MIDI samplers which can transmit samples over the SCSI bus using a
special, somewhat proprietary protocol.  Unfortunately, with at least one
vendor, MIDI over SCSI transfers are much slower than direct disk access
(20 K/sec vs. 200 K/sec or more).  My idea is to provide a virtual hard
disk on the SCSI bus which the sampler can access.  I hope that with
a virtual disk, proper (or almost proper) synchronization is easier to
implement than with a real disk.
