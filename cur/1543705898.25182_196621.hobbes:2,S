Ok, shortly after posting earlier today, it did indeed happen again with 2.6.2. I was just clicking on mails in my sylpheed client. There wasn't much load, I wasn't doing anything but reading mails.
So I built another 2.6.2 with acpi and io-apic disabled and ran it for about 5 hours and the problem reoccurred. I was just chatting on IRC and moved my mouse and it happened. Again, I was doing nothing else so load wasn't a factor.
psmouse.c: MX Mouse at isa0060/serio1/input0 lost synchronization, throwing 2 bytes away.
Gee whiz, it just happened again while composing this mail :-)
So it doesn't have anything to do with acpi, or being under load for that matter, on my system, anyway.
Mike
