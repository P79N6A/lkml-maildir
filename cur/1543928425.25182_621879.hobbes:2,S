I don't quite see where it comes from but there is another reference
on the task struct held by the scheduler  That we don't drop until
finish_task_switch with exit_state == TASK_DEAD.
So since we have one additional reference the task_struct won't
get freed.
We don't set TASK_DEAD until much later.

No.  We should be fine.
In fact it looks like this is just a sles9 issue and mainline is
fine, as we can safely schedule until just before the end of do_exit.
