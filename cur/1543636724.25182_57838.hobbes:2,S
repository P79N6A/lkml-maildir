Uh, I have seen no patches from David for this?  Have I somehow
missed this?  
I would dearly love to see this functionality get added.  I would 
also like to hear what the implementation plan is.  Will the 
need for /etc/pcmcia go away?  Will the new code do a better job
of knowing what drivers to load without system configuration files?
How will device removal be handled?  Will we still need cardctl
and cardmgr?  
I just went through a process yesterday of trying to get some
PCMCIA wireless PC Card configuration.  It isn't at all straightforward,
even with pcmcia-cs.
