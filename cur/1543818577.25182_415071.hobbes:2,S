Nick, OpenVZ, for example, uses "User Bean Counters" patch originally 
developed by Alan Cox. The good thing is that it is fully separate from 
virtualization and allows to control any users or set of processes. 
Don't you think it is valuable and helpful feature itself? Why are you 
afraid of resource management?
Thanks,
