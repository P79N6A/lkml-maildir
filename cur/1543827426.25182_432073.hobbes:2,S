I thought about this as well (I think that's how Valgrind works) but
it would increase the chances of missing real leaks. It currently
looks for the start of the block and a few locations inside the block
(those from which the main pointer is computed using the
container_of() macro).
I need to do some tests to see how it works but I won't be able to use
the radix_tree (as storing each location in the block would lead to a
huge tree).
