You could do this by having modules loaded at boot time. Rather than compiling
the modules into the kernel and trying to hack them out later, you compile them
normally as modules, but then get the kernel to initialise them at boot time, 
as if they'd been loaded by insmod, before the root filesystem is mounted.
They can be passed to the kernel in much the same way as an initrd is - by 
loading them into memory and passing a pointer. In fact, a proposed standard 
already exists for this, grub already supports this for other OS kernels.
Take a look at
