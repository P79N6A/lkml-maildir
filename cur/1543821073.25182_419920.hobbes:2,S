hm.  I'm leaning more towards doing something expedient and obvious for
2.6.17.  It's pretty late in the cycle, and the only downside is the loss
of a kbyte or two.  Plus I'll be at linuxtag next week and won't be around to
help out.
So if it's OK, can we do something minimal, revisit it after 2.6.17?
