OK, here goes...
1 - by eliminating feeding enthopy from network cards you are
eliminating all sources of enthropy for _lots_ of people (think
headless servers, embedded systems - even though there can be other
sources of enthropy there) Unfortunatelly, bad enthropy is still
better than no enthropy (just think - no ssh / https, etc, etc)
2 - some platforms have much better enthropy sources than ethernet (or
user input), just think hardware rngs, or even the sound card rng
thing mentioned above
3 - as people said, your example (CRC-16 on specific platfoms) is
(IMHO) an exxageration. Of course, /dev/random should try and protect
us from whatever protocol being broken. That being said, this
protection should be 'realistic'. In theory most things are broken if
we have enough equipment and computing power.
My conclusion, I have no problem removing SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM *IN
SPECIFIC CASES* (meaning, this should be user configurable). In a
secure environment / platform has rng, it could be turned off, and in
a headless server / embedded system / it could be left on.
Of course, that's just MHO...
