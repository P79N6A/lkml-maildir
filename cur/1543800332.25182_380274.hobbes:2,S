No there are no large jumps, it really seems that this was the network
code causing an RCU callback to drop ~2K routes at once.  Specifically
RCU invokes dst_rcu_free 2085 times in a single batch
(call_rcu_bh(&rt->u.dst.rcu_head, dst_rcu_free) is only called from
rt_free() and rt_drop()).
I have found that many of the paths in the network stack that can cause
high latencies can be tuned via sysctls (for example
net.ipv4.route.gc_thresh); this one may be the same.
