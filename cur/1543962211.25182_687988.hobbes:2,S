This report is a bit mysterious.  I assume you're referring to x86's
	"%s%s[%d]: segfault at %lx ip %08lx sp %08lx error %lx"
printk in the kernel logs?
Can you please send some examples of the log output?
Is there actually any observeable problem apart from the logs?  Are
applications dying where they previously did not?
Thanks.
