Which conflicts with IDE layer reference counting  & locking scheme
as IDE layer can send (special) requests to the device without any
device driver loaded.

The fix would be to fail the previous requests during removal of the
device [ somebody already posted a patch to do that but I didn't have
time to give it proper thought ] or alternatively to add the offline state to
the device [ so processing of the requests would be resumed after device
is online again ].
