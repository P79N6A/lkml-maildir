Hi, Grzegorz. Thank you again for your response.
I haven't been up with linux kernel since I have been experimenting with
my motherboard to see if I could make it stable.

Didn't know that until I saw the following in the dmesg log:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
rbrito@dumont:~$ dmesg | grep -i via

This also answers the question of my motherboard having the revision A
of the southbridge.

Yes, I found some of them. See below.

This is something that I still have not tried, because I lost a good
amount of time using Gold Memory (already mentioned in this thread) to
scan for bad memory.
Even though GM is shareware and only limited its tests to the "quick
tests", it did a *much* better job than memtest86+ finding errors (i.e.,
Gold Memory found errors with my system even when memtest86+ didn't).
Perhaps some of those tests could be included in memtest86+.
Oh, and the fact that we have both memtest86{,+} doesn't help one when
choosing what to use. :-(

It had 256MB + 128MB running at PC100 speed (even though both were rated
to work at PC133 speeds).

The catch is that the problem seems to be transient and not that easy to
reproduce. For instance, I had 2 x 512MB + 256MB installed and it
"worked" (meaning that it booted Linux and the system was useable, even
though I saw some problems with md5sums on my system).
Then, just removing the 256MB module made the computer not even POST
anymore! Weird, isn't it? Beyond anything that I can explain yet.

So, you know what I am talking about when I want to keep what I have
just for the moment.
