Hello,
I'm running SuSE 6.3, using a kernel 2.2.13 with "CONFIG_2GB" set to "y"
on my dual PIII box. Trying to start binaries which allocate more memory
than 554 MByte, I get an segmentation fault. For example the strace
output of the stream benchmark with parameter n set to 24220000 looks
like:
execve("./stream_linux", ["./stream_linux"], [/* 66 vars */]) = 0
--- SIGSEGV (segmentation fault) ---
+++ killed by SIGSEGV +++
My linux box however has 1 GByte memory installed, which is reported
correctly by utilities like top etc...
  2:59pm  up  5:48,  4 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.05
64 processes: 62 sleeping, 1 running, 0 zombie, 1 stopped
CPU states:  0.1% user,  2.2% system,  0.0% nice, 97.5% idle
Mem:  1036336K av, 180660K used, 855676K free,  21864K shrd,  20968K
buff
Swap: 1052216K av,    528K used, 1051688K free                 60528K
cached
Any regards are welcomed
