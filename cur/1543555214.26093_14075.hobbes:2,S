Hello,
I just got a severe ext2 filesystem corruption again (something from
ext2_free_blocks about freeing blocks not in datazone and then in system
zones and also allocating block in system zone). Previously (last week) it
happened on a 4cpu machine. Today on 2cpu. All UP machines running latest
kernel were perfectly stable (wrt to this particular bug).
Regards,
Tigran
