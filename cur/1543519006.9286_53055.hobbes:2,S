This was discussed some months ago here and the consensus is that
readl/writel are supposed to guarantee ordering just as they do on the
x86. However on the Alpha they didn't use to and this was only updated
somewhere during 2.3.x, 2.2.x has the old behavior. The PPC macros on
the other hand does include the ordering.
With the new interface you also have the option of using
__raw_writel/__raw_readl to get non ordered, native byte order access
to the PCI shared memory. Which allows you to do optimize the access
better in case it makes sense for y our device and you know what you
are doing.
