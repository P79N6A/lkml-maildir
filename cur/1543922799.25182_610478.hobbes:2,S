For some reason I didn't get 2/2 so I can't make an inline comment but 
one thing I noticed while trying to build a smack kernel is that smack 
has a kconfig dependancy on NETLABEL and SECURITY_NETWORK. This is 
unfortunate because user X wanting to try out smack won't see it in the 
config until he goes and enables those things (which he wouldn't know 
about without reading the smack Kconfig). It would be nice if those were 
selects instead.
