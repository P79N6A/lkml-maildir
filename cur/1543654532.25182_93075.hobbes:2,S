For the record (more of a recap of previous messages over the last few days), DRM is still kinda broken, at least for my Radeon card.
Arjan's fixes seemed to have fixed the Rage 128 DRM but Radeon DRM is still mighty sketchy. I'm scared to let my GL-based screensaver kick in lest it lock my system up. His fixes supressed the kernel oops that occurred when starting XFree and the unavailability of hardware acceleration in DRI games, but the end result is still that no DRI applications will run correctly in 2.4.20-ac1, or anything past -rc2-ac3 for that matter (which as you can see below is when the DRM updates were made in foresight of the new xfree 4.3 drm interface.
I was unable to catch any kernel messages after starting GL-based apps, but it has just occurred to me that remote access might still work and I could dump any kernel messages from there. I will write some more later...
Regards
Josh
