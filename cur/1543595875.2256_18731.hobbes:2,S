Can we then expect to see all mention of authors in drivers disappear from
the boot?  Same with url's, version #'s and the like?  The built by
user@host message is a good bit of "drumming ones own drum" while
contributing very little (running 'make' vs. writing the system).
Is the kernel boot screen so sacred that it requires us to make it the arid
wasteland that the HP-UX boot is?  This verbosity is useful in many cases
and certainly harmless.

} I agree.  What usually seems to end up happening is that someone
