hw_random can not and will not support HIFN, freescale, ixp and 
great majority of the existing and future HW crypto devices.
I mean that userspace daemon(or any other one) which want to contribute
entropy
should use crypto framwork to obtain all it's data, but not different
access methods for each separate driver.
