No.  2.4.x allows me to to "make modules_install" even if some modules
don't work.  My kernel build script compiles the modules with "make -k
modules", and if some non-essential modules doesn't build I can simply
ignore that and go ahead.  There is no need to disable that module
temporarely in .config (and risc to forget to reenable it later ...).
