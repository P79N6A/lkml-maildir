Luben: I guess you didn't get what I meant.
I was referring that there are other
*vendors* (not LSI, e.g MegaRAID) that are 
working on sas solutions with sas firmware 
implementation. One that comes to mind is
Intel SunRise Lake, which is non a MPT based 
solution, that would work with Christophs 
Sas Layer. There maybe others, such as emulex.
Perhaps James S. could comment on that.
