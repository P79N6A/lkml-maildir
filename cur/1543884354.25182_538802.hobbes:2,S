So when this sort of thing comes up, why can't somebody put together a 
trivial patch to update feature-removal-schedule.txt? If a deadline is 
reached, and a removal is attempted and aborted, the deadline should be 
extended, obviously. So then the patches can be resubmitted (or recreated, 
even) when the new deadline is reached, da capo.
