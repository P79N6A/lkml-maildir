Yes you make a very valid point and something I've been stewing over privately
for some time. contest runs benchmarks in a fixed order with a "priming" compile
to try and get pagecaches etc back to some sort of baseline (I've been trying
hard to make the results accurate and repeatable). 
Despite that, you're correct in assuming the IO load will fluctuate widely. My
initial tests show that noload and process_load (not surprisingly) vary very
little. Mem_load varies a little. IO Loads can vary wildly, and the worse the
average performance is, the greater the variation (I mean percentage variation
not just absolute).

I'll create some results based on 3 runs soon.

Agreed. There probably is no statistically significant difference in the
different gcc versions.
Contest is very new and I appreciate any feedback I can get to make it as
worthwhile a benchmark as possible to those who know.
