Well, I don't know for sure, but thankfully most distro development is
pretty transparent.
The current Fedora Core 6 development (and consequently RHEL5 and
CentOS5) is using 2.6.18-rc kernels (actually as of yesterday, your git
tree).
The current plan is for Debian Etch to freeze on October 18th with a
release in December. There is a good possibility they'll move from
2.6.17 to .18.
