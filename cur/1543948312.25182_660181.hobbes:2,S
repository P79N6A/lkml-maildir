The whole paragraph is misworded anyway (before and after), because
it never says one has to use tabs. Just that tabs are 8. Oh wow.
Here's a rewording of everything I am unhappy with, and it goes
a bit further than tabs and spaces.
It may all sound like we are trying to be nitpicky about minuscule
things, but obviously, if there is a way to go against common practice
but still comply to CS, someone will do it in some patch.
