This one seems to have a rather problematic patch, which I can't find
any explanation for.
Specificly:

This seems to be due to trying to use the same flag for
USB_DEVICE_ID_CYPRESS_MOUSE as well, however this is very wrong.
The original user of HID_QUIRK_2WHEEL_MOUSE_HACK,
USB_DEVICE_ID_A4TECH_WCP32PU, actually /HAS/ a button labeled BTN_EXTRA,
which after this patch can no longer even be used.
The only proper approach is to rename HID_QUIRK_2WHEEL_MOUSE_HACK and
add a new one for the Cypress mouse as well.
If need be I can generate such a patch, however I will need to know what
to generate it against.

If I have trouble installing Linux, something is wrong. Very wrong.
