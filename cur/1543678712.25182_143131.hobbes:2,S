Subject: [PATCH] bttv update for max cards

For us unluck people who have many slots in our PCI backplane, and
actually are required to fill them with these cards, it sucks to have a
kernel limit of 4 cards.
This patch doubles the number to 8, which is still low for an IPC chassis,
but it is much better than 4.
