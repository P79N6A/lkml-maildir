A little more information:
On a dual system:
Running as root -> Single process app (50% total CPU)-> locks out network
Running as root -> Multi process app (100% total CPU) -> locks out network
Running unprivileged -> Single process(50%) -> Network works fine
Running unprivileged -> Multi process(100%) -> locks out network
Going to try a few other network cards if I find one.
