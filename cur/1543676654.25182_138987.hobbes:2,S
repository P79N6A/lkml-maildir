2.5.70-mm6
For what it's worth, I'm running an LFS base system with very few packages 
installed over the top. X is as packaged, it is not reniced. I am, however, 
running setiathome constantly in the background, which seems to pound the 
scheduler.
As Maciej reported, this seems to be significantly better with -mm5 (HZ = 
1000?). Amusingly, doing a renice -20 `pidof xmms` seems to make absolutely 
no difference to the scheduler in 2.5-mm.
This kernel does not have preempt enabled.
Cheers,
Alistair.
