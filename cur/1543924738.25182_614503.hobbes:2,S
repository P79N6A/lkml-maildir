I take it there's a patch some where -- outside of this set
of four -- to initialize that new field so drivers will get
valid pin setup data?  (That name doesn't sound like it's
platform data, by the way.)
That's going to need to merge in sync with this patch, else
I'd think the resulting kernel won't run ...
