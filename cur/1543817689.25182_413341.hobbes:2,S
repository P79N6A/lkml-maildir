Thomas,
Can you look at these next two patches to see if they are decent.
The first patch is a simple update to allow for CB_IRQSAFE functions to
return HRTIMER_RESTART.  The next patch uses this in timeofday to
periodically update a time interval so that the last_cycle doesn't wrap.
Now if we have HIGH_RES turned off, this needs an update to make the
cycle update function a high priority.  But since that isn't simple to
do yet without hacking a change of priority when setting up, I'm leaving
it as is.
