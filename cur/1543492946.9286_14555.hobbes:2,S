Yes I have a testcase. I usually use xosview to visualize the CPU
usage on my dual PII system. When I start a pure numbercrunching job,
I can see how the numbercruncher is sheduled out by xosview by any
screen update of xosview. The kernel sees then an idle CPU and
schedules the numbercruncher onto the other CPU. This looks like a
__perfect__ "numbercruncing ping pong".
