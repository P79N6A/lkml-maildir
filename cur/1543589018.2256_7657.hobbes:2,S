Hi all!
While burning a cdrom, xcdroast 0.98alpha8 hanged up. After killing it,
the cdwriter doesn't respond to any commands and the tray door doesn't
open anymore.
The cdwriter isn't mounted (df output and cat /proc/mounts).
output from eject -v /dev/scd1:
eject: device name is `/dev/scd1'
eject: expanded name is `/dev/scd1'
eject: `/dev/scd1' is not mounted
eject: `/dev/scd1' is not a mount point
eject: `/dev/scd1' is not a multipartition device

vanilla linux 2.2.19 SMP (2x700 Mhz Pentium III Coppermine, 512 MB)
SuSE 7.1 distro
output from scsi_inquiry /dev/sr1:
PLEXTOR   CD-R   PX-W1210S  1.01, byte_7=0x18
in /var/log/messages:
kernel: sr1: CDROM (ioctl) reports ILLEGAL REQUEST.
Can I somehow do a scsi reset or anything to be able to use again the
cdwriter whitout rebooting?
Why did this happen?
Thanks, Richard

   Unix IS user friendly. It's just selective about who its friends are.
