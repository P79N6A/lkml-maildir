Nice coverity checker! *pat pat*
Now, a question: Where can I find the latest version of the files that concern the avs6eyes driver? In april, I got this mail that informed me that the avs6eyes driver patch had been removed from the -mm tree. I figured that it was removed because of the lack of internal V4L2 support when V4L1 was about to be chucked out from the kernel. I looked around a little to see if I could find the driver, but I couldn't.
Obviously, as you've found bugs in it, I didn't look in the right places. Where, pray tell, did the little critter go?
Getting a new job and moving to another city has hampered me in my efforts to work on the driver, that's why I've been so quiet.
