The kernel is unlike GNOME in so many different ways, there's just no
way to compare their development cycles.
People remember, the kernel evolves organically.  We don't know what's
going to be in the next 2 kernel releases just because we don't know
what's going to show up, and what hardware is going to be released, and
what kind of problems people are going to have, and what kind of
proposed patches are going to work out.
The way the kernel is developed is _so_ different from any traditional
software development process is defined.  So for people to try to put
traditional requirements on the kernel (6 month cycles, etc.) is just
not realistic.
And please for everyone wanting to go with a stable series like is being
proposed, go read the thread a while ago on this list that caused the
creation of the -stable tree.  In it lots of people who know what they
are talking about discuss the difficulties of doing a "bug fix only"
tree, and other such things.  Out of that discussion came the very
restrictive guidelines that are described in
Documentation/stable_kernel_rules.txt.  To try to do more than what is
defined there, without lots of money and man-power behind you, is a
quick trip to madness...
Best of luck to you all,
greg k-h
