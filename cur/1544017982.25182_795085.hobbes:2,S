Yup :)  I'll try to take a look at your patches this week.  At a 
minimum, the removal of the locks seems highly desirable.

Yup, extremely biased.  It was meant to hurt the dput/iput path 
specifically and I used it as a way to compare apples to apples 
with/without the changes.  It is still representative of a real-world 
workload we see though (our frontend servers when they are restarted 
have many tcp sockets, easily more than 50K each).

Yup.  We pulled that change into our tree a while back for the same 
reason.  It doesn't help the lock contention issue though.
