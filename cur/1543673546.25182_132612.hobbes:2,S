Actually it does fix it.  I added code in vmtruncate_list() to do a
down_write(&vma->vm_mm->mmap_sem) around the zap_page_range(), and the
problem went away.  It serializes against any outstanding page faults on a
particular page table.  New faults will see that the page is no longer in
the file and fail with SIGBUS.  Andrew's test case stopped failing.
I've attached the patch so you can see what I did.
Can anyone think of any gotchas to this solution?
