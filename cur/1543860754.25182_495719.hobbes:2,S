Huh? The filesystem can have as large a damned identifier as it likes.
NFSv4 uses 128-byte filehandles, for instance.
POSIX filesystems are another matter. They can only have 64-bit
identifiers thanks to the requirement that inode numbers be 64-bit
unique and permanently stored, however Linux caters for a whole
truckload of filesystems which will never fit that label: look at all
those users of iunique(), for one...
