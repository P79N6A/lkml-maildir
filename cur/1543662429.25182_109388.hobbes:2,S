I am confused. If I apply your patch, I get a failure to resume (precise
symptoms below) on both boards I've tried it on. Applying this obviously
broken patch 'fixes' it:

        acpi_copy_wakeup_routine(acpi_wakeup_address);
If I reserve the whole three pages I scribble on in the above patch (and
which we used to scribble on), by calling alloc_bootmem_low(3*PAGE_SIZE)
in acpi_reserve_bootmem(), then the failure to resume returns. I _need_
to scribble on whatever's after us :)
Failure mode is as follows:
Upon resume, _all_ processes with a userspace VM will oops on being
rescheduled. In every case, %eip is zero and %esp is the very top of the
8KiB area allocated for the task structure and stack. For example:
 portmap left refrigerator

 printing eip:
