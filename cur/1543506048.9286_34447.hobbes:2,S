Why not?
You shouldn't really do compares on it anyway, so the type doesn't matter.
And to me, "unsigned" makes much more sense for time as it is implemented
in the kernel - it never goes negative, but it can wrap. That's basically
what "unsigned" means.
Also the C standard actually guarantees nice wrapping behaviour for
unsigned, something it doesn't guarantee for signed values. So as long as
you're working with wrapping values, you should always use unsigned. We
then at the last possible moment know that we're playing with a two's
complement machine, and that's where we do the signed cast to test the
high bit to make it easy on the compiler, but you could conceptually think
of it as a test for the high bit (which is portable C) rather than as a
test for the sign (which is _not_ portable C, but nobody cares because
nobody sane does anything but two's complement).
So I really don't see the point of trying to change the type to anything
else or trying to hide it with some random new typedef that doesn't buy
you anything in real life. Don't abstract things away unless you get some
real _advantage_ from the abstraction, and I don't see the advantage.
