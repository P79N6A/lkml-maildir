That was my understanding so far. So then I haven't gone crazy, thank god.

Someone needs to adjust the text then.

I completely agree with this definition of SYN flooding and then I will 
also say that you can 'stop' SYN flooding, well, at least you give 
legitimate clients a real chance to still successfully connect to your 
service, while it is under a SYN flood. I think we agree now. It should 
only be remarked that the line is still flooded, thus the wording "100 
stop SYN flood" is simply inappropriate in my eyes. It's all a matter of 
definition.
