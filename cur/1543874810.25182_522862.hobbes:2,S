Hi,
Thanks for your comments.
I'm sorry for my late reply.

OK, I'm going to fix them and repost the patchset.

I'm wondering which interface is preferred...
1) Just rename "dirty_limit_ratio" to "dirty_blocking_ratio."
    Those who had been changing dirty_ratio should additionally modify
    dirty_blocking_ratio in order to determine the upper limit of dirty pages.
2) Change "dirty_ratio" to a vector, consists of 2 values;
    {blocking ratio, writeback starting ratio}.
    For example, to change the both values:
      # echo 40 35 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio
    And to change only the first one:
      # echo 20 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio
    In the latter way the writeback starting ratio is regarded as the same as the
    blocking ratio if the writeback starting ratio is smaller. And then, the kernel behaves
    similarly as the current kernel.
3) Use "dirty_ratio" as the blocking ratio. And add
    "start_writeback_ratio", and start writeback at
    start_writeback_ratio(default:90) * dirty_ratio / 100 [%].
    In this way, specifying blocking ratio can be done in the same way as
    current kernel, but high/low watermark algorithm is enabled.
