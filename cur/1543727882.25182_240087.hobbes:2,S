If the behavior doesn't match the man page, it's buggy.
Looking through your source code, I see that several
additional OSes can handle addressing by device name,
but you've disabled this for them. I pity the users.
It's even obvious how to use drive letters on NT.
I would be happy to maintain a decent cdrecord, provided
that somebody can find me some funding. This would take
a great deal more time than procps does currently.
It would require a never-ending supply of blank disks
and, at least initially, a pile of hardware.
I'm not kidding. If some Linux distributer or Linux .org
can fund me (my kids like to eat), I'll fix this problem.
