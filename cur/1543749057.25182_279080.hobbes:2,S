OK, my first attempt at a hack is done. If anyone wants a quick and
nasty dynamic system call interface, here it is. It should work on any
arch, although it is not user space thread safe (SMP safe though). It
dynamically creates a device that implements system calls through it.
It's a hack, but it gets around the kernel maintainers from forbidding
dynamic system calls.
