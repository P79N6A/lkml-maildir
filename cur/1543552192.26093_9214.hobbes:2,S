Sounds like something is stealing your ram.
Usual suspects are..
Shadow RAM is enabled.
  - This steals a TINY (usually 64k for BIOS, and 32k each for each extra 
memory address enabled) of ram. Nothing major though.
Local memory accessing devices.
  - Embedded video cards (and possibly embedded sound devices) on boards 
using the Intel 815E chipset (and others) use local RAM for memory, instead 
of their own special memory - to reduce cost. Apart from weird memory 
sizes, this also can lead to latency and slow-down issues when accessing 
the memory normally. Many of these machines have AGP slots, and almost 
always have a PCI slot, so throwing in a cheap video (audio?) card can 
remove such issues, and frees up that memory again. Maximum I've seen a 
board allow for local video ram is 8 Meg, which is pretty much the amount 
you are missing. The board in question was a Socket 7 board with embedded 
video.
