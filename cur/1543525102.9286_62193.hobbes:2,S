Let me guess, this happened at a time when there was heavy
memory pressure?
After my memory changes (2.2.15pre5 and 6) we caught a lot
of places where the code was trying to allocate memory
with __GFP_WAIT set but completely unprepared to actually
wait!
It should be obvious that this can lead to a hanging
process when the system gets low on memory. This bug is
present in all 2.2 kernels (but very hard to trigger in
earlier ones). I hope to have it fixed in 2.2.15pre6 and
later, __get_free_pages() there contains a workaround to
the problem.
regards,
Rik
