I agree, the existing code doesn't exactly discourage its use in
fastpath code, but we should be doing so. (The recent addition of
hierarchy_mutex is a step in that direction, although it still has
some issues to be cleaned up). But it seems to me that exposing the
lock is an invitation for people to use it even more than they do
currently. There's certainly no performance argument for exposing it,

Yes, I'd rather hide the real lock in this case.
