Wow.  Mutt really didn't like quoting this.

Another take would be to use a cacheline.  But I guess the difference
between 32/64/cacheline is mostly academic, given the rate of changes
to struct dentry.
Unless the minimum length for inline names is configurable, as in the
patch below.  (Note to self: I really should finish my test setup
before posting any further patches without performance numbers.)
