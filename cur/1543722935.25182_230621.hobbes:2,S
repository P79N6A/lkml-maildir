Nope... A fluke... Mostly...
FWIW the sound & networking appear to run fine for a while after 
resuming. But I just started a DVD. It ran fine for about 30 seconds and 
then the sound went. About 30 seconds later the video froze and the app 
(xine) has frozen also. (kill -9 time...).
restarting xine it runs the viodeo for about 10 secs before freezing 
again... With no sound...

The ethernet does still work though... Maybe it's fixed half the problem...
