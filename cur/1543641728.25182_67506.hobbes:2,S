A patch had been previously sent to the list fixing the __FUNCTION__ 
problem in ip_nat_helper.c was missing.  It was needed before the file 
would compile.
I've beat on the floppy driver and it seems to work well.  I haven't been 
able to make it hiccup yet.
The IDE subsystem likewise seems stable in limited testing.
