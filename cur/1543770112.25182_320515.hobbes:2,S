It's not visible but it's still allocated and referenced. So on doing a
rmmod these class_devices are being deallocated which crashes as the
class device is not connected properly.

Oops. Correct.

It's not. Whenever you try to rmmod the adapter it becomes highly
relevant. If it doesn't crash you've at least generated a memleak as the
class device is never freed.
(And these are quite a few for Wide-SCSI Double-channel adapters ...)

Correct for the parent device. The class device has to be deallocated
properly if a rmmod should work properly.
New patch attached. Please apply.

Subject: Fix refcount for failed devices
When a non-present device is scanned it is not properly deregistered
from the driver core. Calling XXX_initialize() functions from the driver
core sets the reference count to 1, so for proper deallocation a
XXX_put() has to be issued.
