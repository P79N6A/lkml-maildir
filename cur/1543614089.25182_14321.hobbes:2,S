The above question is pretty much off-topic for Linux Kernel...
Basically it means that your rpc.statd daemon is unaware of a lot of
its clients. It is probably failing to save their IP-numbers to disk.
Check therefore that the directories /var/lib/nfs/sm, and
/var/lib/nfs/sm.bak (or /var/lib/nfs/statd/sm, ... on some platforms)
are writable by the rpc.statd process.
Cheers,
  Trond
