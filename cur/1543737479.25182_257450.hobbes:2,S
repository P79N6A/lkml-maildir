found it.
it's a new piece of kernel code verify_command in
drivers/block/scsi_ioctl.c, which checks for the capability
CAP_SYS_RAWIO.
ah, dammit.
for k3b to work, you'd have to install it setuid root, call
getcap(), remove all but the necessary capabilities (i.e. don't
remove CAP_SYS_RAWIO), do a setfsuid() and setfsgid() and do
a setcap().
fuse (file system in userspace) uses this technique for allowing
mount and unmount but nothing else
[which doesn't work on 2.6.8 btw: the getcap() fails, but i did notice
that debian doesn't install fusermount as setuid to root which is half
the problem...]

Truth, honesty and respect are rare commodities that all spring from
the same well: Love.  If you love yourself and everyone and everything
around you, funnily and coincidentally enough, life gets a lot better.
