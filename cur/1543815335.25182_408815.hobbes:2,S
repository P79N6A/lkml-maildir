You're already using kmem_cache_destroy() mixed with the zone stuff so I 
don't see your point. I would really prefer to feed small bits at a time 
so is there any way I can sweet-talk you into merging the patch?

I am planning to kill the slab wrappers completely. The logic you're 
referring to looks awful lot like GFP_NOFAIL with limiter. Any 
reason we can't just use GFP_NOFAIL for those cases?
