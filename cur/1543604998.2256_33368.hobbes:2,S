The way that it works out where there is other activity on the drives
is a bit fragile.  It works particularly badly when the underlying
devices are md devices.
I would recommend that instead of mirroring 2 stipe sets, you stripe
two mirrored pairs.  The resync should be faster and the resilience to
failure is much better.
