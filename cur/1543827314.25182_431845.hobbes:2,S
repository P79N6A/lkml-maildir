One possible solution to the version-confusion that would avoid  
duplicating features would be to merge the fs/ext{2,3} to fs/ext,  
then make fs/ext register itself as a filesystem under "ext2",  
"ext3", and "ext4".  Then have each name imply a specific set of  
features and compatibility.  That would allow the same performance  
optimizations to affect all 3 even as you make metadata changes in  
the latest version.  I've heard quite some griping about the amount  
of duplicated code between ext2 and ext3; why cause those problems  
again with an "ext4"?  There would probably be some fs/ext/ext{2,3,4} 
_foo.c files that could be compiled in or out depending on configured  
FS support, but I would guess that would make it easier on users and  
developers alike.
