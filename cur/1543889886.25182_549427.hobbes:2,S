Before we continue that road, we should define the expected behavior for
the "cleanup" in error paths. Implementing that transaction-like model,
to rewind a the complete device-creation when something like a symlink
can't be created, may not always be the right thing to do.
I think in most cases, we just want to write something like that to the
error logs and continue, instead of letting a whole subsystem fail, or
in the worst case, prevent the box from booting up.
Thanks,
Kay
