no, a kernel.org kernel. the 2.6 kernel is so much faster for this 
workload that I switched for this app and never looked back. I found that 
if I had 5000 or so idle tasks 2.4 performcane would drop to about a 
quarter of 2.6 (with the CPU system time being the limiting factor)

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
