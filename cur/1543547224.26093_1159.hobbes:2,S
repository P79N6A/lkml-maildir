Funny you should mention that - I was just reading this thread and
thinking "now, how the heck and I going to make some sense of the
locking rules in the new VFS?".  I'm getting to the point where I have
to deal with some subtle issues in my own code and I thought I'd
approach this by writing down the locking rules.  Then I realized that
since I don't have a clue where to start, I'd better do some deep
breathing, relax and think about it.  Here's were I am now:
1) I want to think about what the absolute minimal level of locking
for FS ops could be.  This is the same as asking what the maximum
parallelism could be.  This is not necessarily going to resemble the
current arrangement very much, and it might give shivers to some fs
programmers that are used to being able to count on certain
traditional regions of mutual exclusion.
2) Then I have to go look at the current practice, and get it down in
some sort of notation that's easy to understand.
3) At this point I'd have the two endpoints of a migration path: where
we are (on the road away from BKL) and where we're going (towards the
tightest, most parallel fs you ever did see:-).  This should be useful
in assessing how long that road is, and hence, just how far we are
from having the locking rules settle down.
4) Then post the draft, hopefully attracting some of the usual
flamage.  In other words, trial by fire.

Please cross-post to linux-doc@vger.kernel.org and
kernel-doc@nl.linux.org as well.  On the theory that having more
copies of documentation is always better than less.

There are a number of native English speakers hanging on the linux-doc
list, just waiting to be asked.
