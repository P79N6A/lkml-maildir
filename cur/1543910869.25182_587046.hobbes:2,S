It shouldn't be so hard:
a) statistically: by doing some random math with:
int number_of_seemingly_gcc3.2_reports_eg_per_rc;
int number_of_all_such_reports_eg_per_rc;
int estimated_number_of_all_users_or_developers;
(or maybe some more...)
b) precisely (or even more): by adding proper and often updated
announcements, e.g:
"drivers/usb/host/ohci-pci.c:202: warning: unused variable `pdev'
(BTW, Angelina and Brad will be very suprised this warning is
yet possible!!!)"
