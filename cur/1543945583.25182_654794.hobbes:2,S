Bart,
i think i probably didn't express myself clear enough before. The patch
serves the sole purpose to show exactly whether buf[8 + 4] & 0x01) == 0 and
is in no way the final solution. I just wanted to make sure the caps page
doesn't set the audioplay bit. The final solution would be to add the drive
to the quirks list only, i guess, in case you don't have a better idea.
Sorry for the misunderstanding :=).
