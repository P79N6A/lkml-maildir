The type of the si_band (more correctly: _sifields._sigpoll._fd) field in
	include/asm-*/siginfo.h
is wrong.  It should be `long', not `int'.  We can easily change it
for 32-bit architectures, but what to do for 64bit?  If nobody is
using it (is it possible at all?) we can probably just do it without
disturbing anybody.
Would somebody please take the initiative on this?
