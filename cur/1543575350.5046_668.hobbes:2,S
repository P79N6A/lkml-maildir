Call me stupid [ Chorus: "You're stupid, Linus" ], but I actually compiled
and booted this remotely. And it came up. Which is a pretty good sign that
it doesn't have anything really broken in it.
Still, it would be good to have a few other sharp eyes looking it over.
Look sclean and obviously correct to me, but then _everything_ I write
always looks obviously correct yo me.
