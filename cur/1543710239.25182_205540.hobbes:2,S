Some clown is running around "fixing" our ioctls:
X0081272 is BLKGETSIZE64. Yeah its bust, it was one of those calls that
we passed in sizeof(8) instead of 8. The ioctl should be X0041272. 
The definition is:
#define BLKGETSIZE64 _IOR(0x12,114,size_t)
However at least in debian unstable, util-linux has:
./fdisk/common.h:#define BLKGETSIZE64 _IOR(0x12,114,8)  /* 8 = sizeof(u64) */
./lib/get_blocks.c:#define BLKGETSIZE64 _IOR(0x12,114,long long)
ie X0081272
