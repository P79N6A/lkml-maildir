So, now all is clear: this is the misleading case!

Since this is for some special aim (not default for most classes, at
least not for sched_fair) I'd suggest to change names:
default_timeslice_fair() and .default_timeslice to something like eg.:
rr_timeslice_fair() and .rr_timeslice or rr_interval_fair() and
.rr_interval (maybe with this "default" before_"rr_" if necessary).
On the other hand man (2) sched_rr_get_interval mentions that:
"The identified process should be running under the SCHED_RR
scheduling policy".
Also this place seems to say about something simpler:
http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Basic-Scheduling-Functions.html
So, I still doubt sched_fair's "notion" of timeslices should be
necessary here.
Sorry for too harsh words.
Thanks,
Jarek P.
