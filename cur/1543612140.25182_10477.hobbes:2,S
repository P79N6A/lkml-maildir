Hi,
I can repeatably hang Linux 2.4.9 simply by mounting a cdrom (ide). It's
a dual CPU machine but hangs with UP and SMP kernels. It affects 2 of
our machines (same model, a dell poweredge something or other). The hang
appears quite hard (keyboard lights stop working etc..).
Has anyone else encountered this?
I plan to test on newer kernels but probably won't have chance until
tomorrow...
Kind regards
