No Im not.

I2O owns entire devices on the bus. At startup you query each I2O I/O 
processor and you get back things like
"I just drive my own on card I/O stuff"
"Im a motherboard controller, I know about your aic7xxx and your eepro100,
 right now I'm configured to drive the eepro100 only"
You may find two controllers offering to handle the eepro100, or neither. You
may prefer to run the native driver. Who "owns" a PCI device is a run time
configurable item
