Hi,
we are trying to modify IDE driver as a possible workaround for an 
unreliable storage media.
this driver will expose only a part of the disk to file system by reporting 
the disk capacity as say real_capacity/4. remaining disk will be hidden from 
the file system. in write operation driver will try to write the same data 
in all 4 parts of the same disk for redundancy. in read it will hope to find 
atleast one copy properly written.
we are using kernel version 2.4.26. what approach do you think would be 
appropriate?
Thanks,
Siddhesh
