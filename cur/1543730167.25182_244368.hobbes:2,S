 Good news! With your patch floppy works:
#v+
inserting floppy driver for 2.6.8.1-mm2
acpi_floppy_resource: 4 ioports at 0x3f2
acpi_floppy_resource: 1 ioports at 0x3f7
floppy: controller ACPI FDC0 at I/O 0x3f2-0x3f5, 0x3f7-0x3f7 irq 6 dma
channel 2
Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
FDC 0 is a post-1991 82077
