Subject: [PATCH] fix ACPI poweroff in 2.4.25-rc2

Hi Len,
based on your suggestions, I've read several bug reports about poweroff
problems. I discovered that some people had to pass "nolapic" to make it
operational. I tried the same on my VAIO and it worked. I also found that
other people had to call the old acpi_suspend(ACPI_STATE_S5) code instead
of the new one in acpi_power_off().
So I compared acpi_suspend() with the new code, and noticed that acpi_suspend()
calls acpi_system_save_state() before doing acpi_enter_sleep_state_prep(). This
function is responsible for sending PM events to all system devices, it seems.
Thus, I inserted this call in acpi_poweroff() and it now works (on the VAIO
at least). Does it make sense ? I have yet to test it on other systems, but
if people with poweroff problems could try this patch on top of 2.4.25-rc2,
it would be interesting. Perhaps it could get its way into mainline before
2.4.25 ? Please note that with this one, it's no longer necessary to use
"nolapic" on the command line (for my notebook at least).
Regards,
Willy
