I think the 11/20 had an optional MMU, but I'm not sure. I have a vague
memory that the 8 had a map register, but that may be totally wrong.
UNIX as a useful OS begins with V6 which ran on the 11/40 and
up and these, for sure, had segments. Even V5 needed an 11/40. 
See sheets 16 & 17 in the Lions book.
But I'd love to see a reasonable argument as to why fork/exec would be useful
on an mmu-less processor in the current state of the field.
90% of the semantics disappear.
