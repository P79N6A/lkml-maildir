This looks like mostly generic code. Shouldn't most of this belong
into drivers/xen to be used by other architectures too? Putting 
so much generic code into i386 looks wrong.

Better just put this out of line in the native case too.

We don't do such things with ifdef trees. Put the necessary 
code into asm/

This is mostly identical with native right? Sharing, sharing, sharing.
