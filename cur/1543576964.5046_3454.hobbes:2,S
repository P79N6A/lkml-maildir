Just installed 2.4.0-prerelease, and it looks like FAT
filesystems on hardware 2048-byte sectors are still not
working.
Are there any plans to fix this, or should I consider
such devices obsolete? I'm keeping 2.2.17 around and
rebooting every time I have to access my MO drives --
rather inconvenient.
