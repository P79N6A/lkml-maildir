hello,
	I am trying to detect layouts of the RAID configuration (I have a
software RAID set up. ) Mine is currently left symmetric and the way I am
trying to detect layout is to reaad consecutive blocks and look for
whether there is a big dp when it has to move all the way across..
there seems to be no such thing. e.g.
1  2  3  P
5  6  P  4
9  P  7  8
P 10 11 12
should show some timing difference when block 5 is read -  i get an
exponentially decreasing curve !
any ideas? or other newsgroups i can hit
