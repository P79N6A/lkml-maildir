rmb_me_harder? smp_mb__{before,after}_{atomic_dec,clear_bit} are already ugly enough.
What about hiding all these details in the list access macros? list_insert, list_get_next, etc. With a default implementation based
on a spinlock, and the capable SMP architectures could define an optimized version.
Then Alpha could do whatever flushing is required. But please do not scatter memory barrier instructions all around the kernel.
