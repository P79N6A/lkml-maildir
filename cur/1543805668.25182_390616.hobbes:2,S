OK.. If "vast majority" is the proper way to decide this issue..
.. What does WinXP call the CD writer device?
What's wrong with this picture?  Maybe "vast majority" is the wrong criteria...
'cdrecord -scanbus' tells me I'm supposed to use 'dev=0,1,0', which has *zero*
meaning to me, since my laptop has no SCSI in it.  Fortunately, I also have a
/dev/hdb, and 'dev=/dev/hdb' works the way one would expect if they weren't
attached to a 1986-style naming scheme for some transport mechanism that isn't
present on my hardware.
And you know what? I really don't give a flying <fornicate> in a rolling donut
what FreeBSD calls the device. If I did, I'd have installed FreeBSD.  But I
installed a Fedora distro of Linux, and the only sane naming scheme is the
one that Fedora uses...
