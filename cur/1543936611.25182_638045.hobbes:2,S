The lines prefixed with "hpet0:" are missing; apparently, hpet_alloc()
was never called because hpet_reserve_platform_timers() is disabled
because CONFIG_HPET is not set.  Try enabling this option.  (CONFIG_HPET
is in the "Character Devices" kernel config menu.)
That this option would be required to get the platform HPET code to work
seems like a bug.
