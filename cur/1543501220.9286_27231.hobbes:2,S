Subject: [PATCH] Utility module to capture OOPS output over reboot
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

All,
	I attach a small patch to create a console log that uses the
SMRAM area. This allows OOPS output to be captured and saved across a
reboot.
The conslog.txt file has a brief explanation of how it works. There are
some important limitations:
1)	It only works on Intel platforms
2)	It only works with a motherboard with a modern Intel chipset
	(includes P-II/P-III boards)
It is not for everyone. I build it as a module. It works for me.
The 10 cent summary is that it creates an internal console log,
exposed through /proc/conslog. The console log survives reboots.
Enjoy,
Philip

Axent Technologies, Waltham, MA[unhandled content-type:application/x-gzip]This is a brief note that describes the implementation of the console logger.
The basic idea is that all console output is saved in a circular buffer
that is hidden where it is not destroyed over a reboot.
This particular version of the code uses the SMRAM area at 0xb0000. This
area is normally occupied by a video card, but by fiddling with the appropriate
Intel Northbridge chip, access to real RAM can be enabled. Happily, many
BIOS implementations are either too dumb, or smart enough, not to destroy
this memory area during the power-on memory test.
I'd be interested in finding out which platforms this works on!
Once started, the logger creates /proc/conslog which contains the console
log. The size of the log is 65k, which is ample for seeing any OOPSen
before a reboot.
Installation:
Apply the attached patch with patch -p1 in your linux root. (Tested with 2.2.9).
Run make config, and on the character devices page, turn on the 'log to SMRAM'
option. You can choose either to build it into the kernel, or to have it as
a module. 
Now build your kernel/modules.
If you build it as a module, then you can just insmod conslog.o on a running
system. Note that you must have it loaded to record console output -- there
is no point in loading it *after* a crash.
Licensing:
Currently this is *NOT* under the GPL. It remains copyright Axent Technologies.
I am exploring the possibility to make it available under the GPL.
All use is at own risk etc. Axent Technologies assumes no liability for
any damage etc.
Bugs:
It only works on Intel platforms (owing to the nasty embedded cache flushing
instructions).
It only works with a limited set of motherboard chipsets.
It doesn't work on all platforms -- some BIOSes clear out SMRAM memory,
and some lock the SMRAM area so that it cannot be accessed.
