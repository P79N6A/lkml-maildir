   What is EPCKPT?
   EPCKPT is a checkpoint/restart utility built into the Linux kernel.
   Checkpointing is the ability to save an image of the state of a
   process (or group of processes) at a certain point during its
   lifetime. Checkpoints are important to a wide range of applications.
   The most common uses for checkpointing are:
     * Fault-tolerance
     * Applications trace/Debugging
     * Rollback/Animated playback
     * Process migration
   Our main interest right now is process migration. So, we optimized
   EPCKPT to make process' image the smaller possible, so migration costs
   would be low.
