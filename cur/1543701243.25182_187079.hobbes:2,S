Are you sure you used the right vmlinux binary? Some of this looks 
pretty strange (module_text_address? Whaa?).
However, it also seems to point out that you have SLAB debugging with 
poisoning enabled. That will absolutely _kill_ your performance, and could 
easily explain part of the degradation.
