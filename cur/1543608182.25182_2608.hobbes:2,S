here's my munge of the same data:

the measures I find interesting are the SI/SO rates.  first, the most obvious
feature is that Rik-VM has a serious problem knowing when to *stop* swapping
out.  but SO isn't a bad thing unless it's obsessive: it's when you see high 
*swap-in* that you know the VM has previously chosen bad pages to SO.  
and this is the second big difference: Rik-VM doesn't make nearly as many
mistakes - especially look at Andrea-VM thrashing out-in-out at ~ samples 26-32.
also, if you merely sum the SI and SO columns for each:
		sum(SI)		sum(SO)		sum(SI+SO)
      Rik-VM	43564		317448		290032
      AA-VM	118284		171748		361012
to me, this looks like the same point: Rik being SO-happy, 
Andrea having to SI a lot more.  interesting also that Andrea wins the race, 
in spite of poorer SO choices and more swap traffic overall.

yes, unfortunately this corrupts the value of the data, since the timecourses
are not really comparable, and samples are only vaguely related to time...
