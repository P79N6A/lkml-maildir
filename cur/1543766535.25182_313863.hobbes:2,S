The latter doesn't get called on power-down, which is what the recent
patches for the kexec "fixes" seem to want.

But do we really want every pci driver adding a reboot notifier?  It's
simple, yes, but a lot of extra code everywhere, that I'm pretty sure
the shutdown() hook was ment to handle.

Why would "kexec reboot" be any different from the "normal" system
shutdown?

->shutdown looks like it walks the device tree and shuts down the
hardware in the proper order, why do you think it is an undefined order?
