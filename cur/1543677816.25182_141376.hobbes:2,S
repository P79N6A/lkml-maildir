Sorry for breaking in, but this is an interesting discussion. :-)
I find that the Linux VM tend to push things out in to swap-space when
it does not need it. This is fine. However, I was once told something
about AIX that has lodged itself in the back of my mind.
AIX uses (or used to use) the exact same way of reading/writing data
from/to disk for all I/O. AIX also makes a distinction between code and
data. If code in RAM is unused, it simply gets flushed. If it is needed
again at a later time, it is paged in from disk where it was originally
loaded from. Only dirty data is paged out into swap.
Is it feasible to tweak the Linux VM to behave in the same fashion? If
Linux already does it this way, I'll just shut up. :)
