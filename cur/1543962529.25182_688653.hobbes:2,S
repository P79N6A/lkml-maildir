Exactly, but once people start saying: "Look how many problems people
post to the thread on
a weekly basis where people lose their data when md rebuilds go bad with
non-shared disks" i begin to worry..

It has also been useful to people i know, i just wished to be sure :)
and as Keld Jørn Simonsen and Helge Hafting's comments seems to confirm,
linux md IS nice and stable :)
and as said, what im looking for isnt an in-box backup solution, merely
safety in case one disk burns :)
