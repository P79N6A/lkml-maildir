	Hi Linus,
This patch brings the documentation for /dev/fb* in sync with the
implementation.
The implementation behaves like this since nearly ca. 1.5 years.
This patch is in Alan's tree since nearly 6 months.
Thanks for applying!

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
