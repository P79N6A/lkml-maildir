this is another one of those nasty buggers;
Lock A = the sk->sk_callback_lock
Lock B = priv->lock in the driver
Lock A is only BH safe 
Lock B is hardirq safe and used in the hardirq
Cpu 0			cpu 1
                        user closes the netlink socket
takes lock B in orinoco_send_events 
                        takes lock A  in user context in netlink_release() (for write)
                        interrupt happens
                        takes lock B in hardirq handler (spins)
calls netlink_broadcast
which takes lock A for read (spins)
and you have a nice classical AB-BA deadlock
