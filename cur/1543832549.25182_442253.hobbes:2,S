BSD just uses devname(3) in libc, which asks the kernel via
the kern.devname sysctl. So, /proc/sys/kern/devname for us.
This is essentially what /proc/tty/drivers is today, except
that FreeBSD standardized on a fully functional devfs.
Solaris uses _ttyname_dev(dev_t,buf,bufsize), also in libc.
This is horribly slow, involving a recursive search of
directories listed in the /etc/ttysrch file. The interface
is nice though. You get: ttyname, ttyname_r, _ttyname_dev.
Note that our glibc is often defective, not always upgraded,
and not even the only C library. I won't be relying on it
even if _ttyname_dev() or devname() gets implemented.
If you insist on bringing back the dead though...
I already have code, probably written in 1996 by Charles Blake.
Use /etc/psdevtab for the filename.
File format:
There are 16 tty major numbers (as of the Linux 1.1 kernel,
or thereabouts) with 256 minors each, and the names are 8
characters long. That makes for a 32 KiB file; procps will
verify the length. Major numbers are to be stored in the
following order:
2,3,4,5,19,20,22,23,24,25,32,33,46,47,48,49
The structure is thus like this:
char psdevtab[16][256][8]
Names should be zero-padded, not zero-terminated.
(seriously, a binary file with a tree structure is best)
