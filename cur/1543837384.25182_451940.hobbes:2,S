Right now precious metal stocks are one of the hottest things going. Gold

shows no signs of stopping! Here is an amazing mining play with some HUGE
acquisition news on the way.

E.q.t.d is coming through when the price of precious metals is going
through the roof. Increasing demand from China and India as well as the
U.S. means that mining companies once again are in for WINDFALL profits.

don't come along every day. Trade smart and win!
