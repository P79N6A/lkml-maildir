   Are we going to use Miquel's patch? I cannot build fresh 2.2.x on
   plain RH6.2 without it. The 2.2.19-pre6 comes out without it.  Or
   is "install new bash" the official answer? Alan?
I do not understand, I just got a working 2.2.19-pre6 build on one of
my 6.2 Sparc64 systems, what kind of failure do you see?
Later,
