Would be great if the whole of the European finance industry
recognized that. ;-) However, this mostly applies to the current
situation with products like the backdoored Notes sold to the Swedish
(IIRC) government. With open source products, the issue is different
because they can be reviewed.
Experts like Bruce Schneier have always considered reviewability a
necessary condition for choosing a really secure product, see any of
the FAQs in sci.crypt. (Corollary, applying to all the Linux crypto
efforts: the code must be as simple and well-structured as possible.)

This is the real concern for the U.S. software industry: the rest of
the world has simply lost trust in them and re-gaining it will be
difficult. No wonder that Netscape is rushing to open-source their
crypto products.
