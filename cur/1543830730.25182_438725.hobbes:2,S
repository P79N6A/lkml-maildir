The technical part wasn't very time-consuming at all. Arnd provided the
basic implementation, and I just tweaked it a little to use unifdef and
be a bit more selective about what we export. It's probably taken less
time than it would have done to get Fedora's 'glibc-kernheaders' package
into shape manually the way it always used to be done -- and it'll
_certainly_ be a Godsend for future updates.
The time-consuming part was chasing up those who look after similar
packages in other distributions and making sure they were happy enough
with the principle too -- tracking them down on IRC when they ignored my
emails.
The current hurdle seems to be getting Linus to take it or at least
comment, now that everyone _else_ seems to be fairly much in agreement.
I'm hoping we don't have to let it drag on till the Kernel Summit.
