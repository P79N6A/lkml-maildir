Knowing what these messages are is would be helpful; it tells me what
point in the initialisation it got to.

I'm interested.
This is clearly a use_sg==1 path that has failed to bounce the buffer
for some reason ... and I was contemplating eliminating the GFP_DMA from
our sr driver because I thought the block bouncing had it covered.
It might also be helpful to apply this patch.  It should give a stack
trace of the problem command and not immediately panic the box.
Thanks,
James
