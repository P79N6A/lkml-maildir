Put a 16K "page" into the page cache physically and you need to allocate
1 sg entry and you get a clear benefit, IFF you can allocate the pages. 
Put a 16K "page" into the page cache made up of 4 x real 4K pages which
are not physically contiguous and you need 4 sg list entries - which is
no worse than if you were using 4K pages
	4 per 16K page cache "logcial page"		-> 4 per 16K
	1 per 4K physical page for 4K page cache	-> 4 per 16K
The only ugly case for the latter is if you are reading something like a
16K page ext3fs from an old IA64 box onto a real computer and you have a
controller with insufficient sg list entries to read a 16K logical page.
At that point the block layer is going to have kittens.
