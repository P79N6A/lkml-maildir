Thanks for posting this, it fixes my EHCI + APIC error, and makes my
laptop work just fine.
Turns out that 2.6.14 worked for it, but 2.6.15 didn't.  git bisect a
zillion times later narrowed it down to the usb early handoff stuff but
due to merge issues, it was tough to track down the exact patch.
For fun I tried this one on top of the latest -mm, and it works!
So, care to clean it up to make it feel better to you and send it to me
again so I can add it to my tree?  I know the next SuSE kernel will need
it :)
thanks,
