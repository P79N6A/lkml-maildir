I would need to dig out the documentation and NE2000 reference code if I
even still have them. From memory NE2K needs them but I don't know
offhand if the WD80x3 devices do, or if only some of them do. It'll also
depend on the port - the DPRAM is different to the 8390.
Don Becker wrote the drivers and at the time he tuned them carefully for
performance so I would expect delays to be the ones needed
