Yeah, I found that document, and mentioned it a little lower in the mail ;)

Hm, but then chapter 10 goes and makes things confusing with 
"Alternative INVLPG Behavior"; but I guess if software needs to 
explicitly enable this behaviour in a yet-to-be-determined way, its OK...
Is there any guide about the tradeoff of when to use invlpg vs flushing 
the whole tlb?  1 page?  10?  90% of the tlb?
