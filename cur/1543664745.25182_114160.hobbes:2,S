I tried  two pdc20268's which failed miserably
Used an Asus motherboard and an FIC motherboard, different cables, 
different cards, different powersupply.Hard drives are 200GB western 
digitals, one drive per channel.  
Tried an SIIG card with the SiI680 chipset -- same problem using is and 
the pdc20268, but is more stable than a single pdc -- so now I have 4 
drives on that card.
My kernel is 2.4.21-pre4-ac6 -- let me know if the pre5's solve the problem.
