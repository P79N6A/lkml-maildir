Did you actually try the above command with a SUSE kernel? I don't think so; 
one of the earlier postings in the other thread spiced with strong words 
tried to do other unusual things.

This is already in place with Sam's patches.

There is one source tree for N object trees in general. Going from the N side 
to the 1 side makes a lot more sense than going the other way around.

You will invoke make directly, so you should check if make and the kernel 
sources for the running kernel are available.

Then this should be defined in the Makefile in the kernel sources. Fixing 
problems for people who build their own kernels from vanilla sources without 
paying attention to such details will take you nowhere, it will only mess 
things up even worse.

There could be a few basic checks in kbuild whether or not the required tools 
are available. Telling users who compile kernel modules on their own how to 
install packages sounds a bit much asked for my taste.
