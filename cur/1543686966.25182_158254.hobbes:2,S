Yes the problem is reminiscent of early 2.4 days, but how is it that 2.4.19
doesn't have the problem and 2.6.0-test3 does have the problem on the same
machine?

I will hope to have time to check this next weekend, but I'm sure the 2.4
name ide-cs is used.  I was startled to see 2.6.0-test3 load a module named
ide_cs instead of ide-cs, but there it was.  It was listed that way by
lsmod, but failing in the bind as shown above.  Notice that modprobe used
the same name as lsmod showed.
