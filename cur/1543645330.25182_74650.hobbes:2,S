Let me add that there are currently two places where arch specific drivers
appear, eg:
	arch/{cris,um}/drivers/
and
	drivers/{s390,macintosh,acorn}/
I think it'd be nice to decide on one way or the other. The first place 
has the advantage of putting all arch-specific stuff into one place, the 
second one makes it (IMO) cleaner to share drivers between e.g. s390 and 
s390x, or possibly i386/x86_64 in the future.
