That is not true.  The "likely" path has no taken jumps.
Think about the code again.
How would you optimise it, if you were writing assembly language yourself?
(In more complex examples, another factor is that mis-predicted
conditional jumps are much slower than unconditional jumps, so it is
good to favour the latter in the likely path).
