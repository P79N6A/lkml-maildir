Subject: [PATCH 4/4] NLM: have nlm_shutdown_hosts kill off all NLM RPC tasks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/14/154

If we're shutting down all the nlm_hosts anyway, then it doesn't make
sense to allow RPC calls to linger. Allowing them to do so can mean
that the RPC calls can outlive the currently running lockd and can lead
to a use after free situation.
