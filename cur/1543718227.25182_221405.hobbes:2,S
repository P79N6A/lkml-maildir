You mean this one?
/* If this kobj does not belong to a kset, try to find a parent that does */
The problem I saw with that is even though my kobject won't have a kset, 
my kobject's parent (or grandparent) may and I'll trigger that one.  I'm 
not creating a new device  driver, just extending one so I won't have 
control over that kobject's lineage.
The other way is to create a subsystem using subsytem_init but not to 
add it to the sysfs tree and then add my kobject to that kset and use 
the kset's hotplug filter to stop the hotplug events.  This would 
require extra code and a little bit more memory usage for that kset, but 
I believe that would work.  Any drawbacks to this method?
Or am I missing something?
John
