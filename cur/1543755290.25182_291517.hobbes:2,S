Actually I think that this would be a much better use of relay_write(),
which is unlikely to be used by any client that requires relay_reserve()
to start with. Also, I don't think it complicates the API at all.
Compared to the original API, what we've got now is very simple. So
it basically boils down to:
- use relay_write() if you want putc-like functionality.
- use relay_reserve() if you want to reserve space and write separately.
This is even better than having a separate ad-hoc mode.
