who is the one here showing blind faith in their security?  :)
Now don't get me wrong, I run static analysis tools against selinux
pretty regularly, and while the userspace tools get more and more scary
(as they are under development), the only thing I find in the kernel
code is the occasional unused variable.  And I'm not arguing any flaws
in the model, which indeed is more robust than the AA model.  But if
anyone is certain there are/can be no bugs in the rest of the kernel
which can circumvent selinux, or has perfect faith in their policy, then
your statement likely applies to them.
So as long as the kernel is under development, then by your logic one
might argue that using selinux, even if it is perfect in itself, is more
dangerous than using nothing.
