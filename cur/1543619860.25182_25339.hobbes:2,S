We don't even do that - look at jffs2_read_super(). The only reason it even 
_looks_ like we're using a block device is because it was the easiest way 
to arrange mounting. We only allow you to mount the 'mtdblock' device, 
which isn't actually used - all we do is use the minor number to look up 
the real underlying MTD device. The dependency on _any_ of the block code 
isn't real - I can fix it as soon as there's an incentive to do so (like 
CONFIG_BLK_DEV).

Those can go too. Likewise page->buffers.

I had a go once. Long enough ago that it's probably not worth trying to find
it again. I'd suggest a boolean like CONFIG_BUFFER_CACHE which does the
really intrusive stuff like removing page->buffers, and CONFIG_BLK_DEV which
can be modular (if CONFIG_BUFFER_CACHE is on), and which controls
compilation of everything in drivers/block/ and fs/block_dev.c
