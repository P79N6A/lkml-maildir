No, very useful test, thanks much. Patch as submitted for revision 0x6x will 
stand then.
I do wonder -- is your hda throughput also the same before _ever_ attaching 
anything to the EHCI controller and after? In my case, the slow down only 
happened after switching on my external USB drive once, and would persist 
from that time until reboot (or unloading ehci-hcd, which I kept modular for 
exactly that reason).
The sleep time wasn't the core problem, so I wonder of later VIA chips do 
still have the active async schedule problem...
Alessandro? You said there still was a difference for you between no EHCI at 
all and EHCI after tweaking 4B as Lev showed. How much?
Rene.
