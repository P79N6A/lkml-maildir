I don't see how you would be able to mandate libusual, since it adds
(a small amount of) bloat. I foresee some distributions building without
it for years. Debian is likely to take such course.
We certainly can apply such a patch and tell all complainers to suck
it up, but I am not sure if that would be embraced by distro developers.
I do not want to risk anything that may derail acceptance into
Linus' tree.
