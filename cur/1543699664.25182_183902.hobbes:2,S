Yes, and stock settings with tested ram may
be necessary with nforce2, possibly related to our
timing-related voodoo culture(might overclock
later on in life as timing-related patches evolve).
I have a via board that only recognizes two of
four generic ram sticks, but second stick will cause
an oops soon after. Another via setup will oops
if any fast ram settings(4-way,csl2 etc) is attempted,
though only using tested cas2 ram. "Try a different
stick of ram".
On nforce2 I'm able to use bios "performance"
ram timing but if I manually tweak all the ram
settings up like I can do on other systems, I
get mem-related OOPS with nforce2.
