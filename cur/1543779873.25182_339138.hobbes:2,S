Subject: [git pull] REALLY final InfiniBand updates for 2.6.13

There are two small last-minute fixes for InfiniBand I would like to
get into 2.6.13: one to avoid pain in releasing 2.6.13 with an
incorrect enum definition that we have to rename later, and one to fix
RARP on IP-over-InfiniBand.
If there's still time before 2.6.13, please pull from
    rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/roland/infiniband.git for-linus

    [PATCH] [IPoIB] Handle sending of unicast RARP responses
    
    RARP replies are another valid case where IPoIB may need to send a
    unicast packet with no neighbour structure.

    [PATCH] [IB/cm]: Correct CM port redirect reject codes
    
    Reject code 24 is port and CM redirection, not just port redirection.
    Port redirection alone is code 25.
    
    Therefore we should rename code 24 to IB_CM_REJ_PORT_CM_REDIRECT and
    use IB_CM_REJ_PORT_REDIRECT for code 25.
