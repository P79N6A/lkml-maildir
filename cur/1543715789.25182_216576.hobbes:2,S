Aargh. Ugly ugly. Can you instead _first_ do all the infrastructure, and 
just add the unused "flags" argument to all architectures, ie take this 
part of the patch:

And remove the need for "__HAVE_ARCH_RAW_SPIN_LOCK_FLAGS", and instead 
create a patch where _all_ architectures have that 
	_raw_spin_lock_flags()
define, it's just that they ignore the "flags" value.
I think the patch makes sense, but I'd rather make the infrastructure 
clean, than have another silly architecture flag.
