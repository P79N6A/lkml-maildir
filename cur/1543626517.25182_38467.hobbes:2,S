Anyone had problems with identd not working properly in 2.4.19-pre4-ac4?
It works fine in 2.4.19-pre5 and ther otehr pre4-ac stuff. The ~ is added to my hotsmask when connecting to undernet irc servers while running 2.4.19-pre4-ac4.
All the other pre4-ac and the -pre5 are compiled using same .config. How
could i debug to find out why? or is it known already?
