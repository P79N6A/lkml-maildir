The KNOWNBUGS file was removed with v1.0.5 as it corrected the fault when
statically linked.  You may either statically link, or compile as a module,
your choice. 
Thanks,

Though I am concerned about the KNOWNBUGS file that was in the 1.0.3 patch
but was removed by the later version patches.  It seems to indicate its a
bad idea to compile it directly in the kernel.  Is it better to compile it
as a module?
Thanks for your time...
