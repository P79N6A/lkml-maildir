My machine locked hard last night for an unknown reason under
2.4.3-pre4. Rebooted and it did it's fsck thing. Got alot of errors
about missing '..', fixed alot of things and moved some stuff to
/lost+found.
Some files got screwed up so I can't delete them.
[mhaque@viper html-blah]$ rm -r mac3dfx/
rm: cannot remove `mac3dfx/news/1999/08/199908231702.txt': Input/output
error
rm: cannot remove `mac3dfx/news/1999/08/199908231802.txt': Input/output

rm: cannot remove directory `mac3dfx/news/1999/08': Directory not empty
rm: cannot remove directory `mac3dfx/news/1999': Directory not empty
rm: cannot remove directory `mac3dfx/news': Directory not empty
rm: cannot remove `mac3dfx/dat': Input/output error

My filesystem is probably really screwed up so I'm going to format. But
for future reference, how would one get rid of those files? Or does this
indicate that it's time to reformat and not even consider trying to
delete those files?
