This was a while ago... But when I upgraded to kernel 2.4.20-ck2, I 
tried to play ZBlast (www.svgalib.org/rus/zblast) in both console 
(svgalib) and X mode and the game seemed to be running in double time! 
Is this a timing problem within the code or a quirk in the low latency 
routines of the -ck2 patch? When useing a vanilla 2.4.20 kernel there is 
nothing wrong.
Has anyone else noticed this?
Regards
Josh
