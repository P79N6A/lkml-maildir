Subject: [PATCH] hrtimer: increase clock min delta threshold while interrupt hanging
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Impact: avoid hanging on slow systems
While using the function graph tracer on a virtualized system, the hrtimer_interrupt
can hang the system on an infinite loop.
This can be caused on several situation where something intrusive is slowing the
system (ie: tracing) and the next clock events to program are always before the current
time.
This patch implements a reasonable compromise. If such a situation is detected, we share
the CPUs time in 1/4 to process the hrtimer interrupts. This is enough to let the system
running without serious starvation.
It has been successfully tested under VirtualBox with 1000 HZ and 100 HZ with function graph
tracer launched. On both cases, the clock events were increased until about 25 ms periodic ticks,
which means 40 HZ.
