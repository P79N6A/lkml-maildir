Well - I can certainly not do zero-copy block device access.
What are expected usages of your translation filesystem?
Hi-performance things like zero-copy block device access, or
low-performance things like transparently ungzipping? If it is the
second case, uservfs.sourceforge.net is perfectly applicable, if not,
you really need to modify kernel..
