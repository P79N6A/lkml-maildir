Some will probably agree that this kind of information should be
optionaly ( option in kernel configuration ) restricted for non root
users. The same problem apply to /proc restrictions, that are available
with grsec only, but many will also agree that this should be option in
kernel. 
One of the security rules says that we should not give away information
that is not required for others. Fe. nobody should know (except
root/administrators) who is loged on or even what programs i am running.
This way i am able sometimes to see sensitive information that is passed
in command line (fe with wget).
