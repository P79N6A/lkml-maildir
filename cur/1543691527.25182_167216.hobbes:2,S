Hi Ludovico,
Thanks for the report. The AS messages should be harmless. The warn
statement is an incorrect assertion (I'm actually surprised the only
reports of it are IDE TCQ). It should not be the cause of the attempt
to access beyond the end of device messages.
I think IDE TCQ is not 100% stable at the moment (Jens?) and you have
to do things like ensure only one drive on the cable (not a master and
slave). Your best option is to turn TCQ off. You could try booting with
the argument elevator=deadline, however. That would fix it if it were
an AS problem.
