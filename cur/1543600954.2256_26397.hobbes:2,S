Same things here. I'm also experiencing random segfaults with kernels 
2.4.10pre[47]. My motherbord is Chaintech CT-7AIA2 (kt133A/686A), Duron 600.
I did'nt see such things with kernels 2.4.[78]. The problem persists even 
after recompiling kernel with K6-III optimisation. Note, this motherboard
was rock solid and I never had any problems with athlon-optimised kernels
prior to 2.4.9.
