I am currently using IDE-SCSI (for when I hook up a burner) on my system
running 2.2.1-ac2; last night, I left the room playing some MP3s off of a
CD and xlocked my machine.  When I came back, my xlock was non-functional
and my machine looked dead.  Attempting to determine the cause, I tried to
use sysrq to kill the processes on the VT.  This did not work, but when I
attempted to sync, my machine oopsed.  So, I rebooted into vanilla 2.2.1
and was able to replicate it by copying all the files on the CD to
/dev/null.  I can provide the first oops if you want and full .config, as
well as testing of any patches.
