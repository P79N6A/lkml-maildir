This doesn't help kdump folks. Interrupt pending from a device
from the first boot can flood the system when another driver
sharing the irq gets enabled in the second boot (kdump boot).
The disabling of interrupts need to be done on a per-device
basis for kdump to avoid this problem.
That said, I am not sure what is the issue with the console
drivers. What good is the irq for the console driver if
it hasn't requested for it ? Why should disabling it affect
consoles ? The interrupt will get enabled as soon as the driver
requests for it as per Vivek's patch. Am I missing something here ?
Thanks
