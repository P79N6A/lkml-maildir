Well it's interesting that it is repeatable.
First thing to do is to eliminate hardware failures:
1: Is the oops always the same, or does the machine crash in other ways,
   with different backtraces?
2: Try running memtest86 on that machine for 12 hours or more.
3: Can the problem be reproduced on other machines?
4: try a different compiler version.
Thanks.
