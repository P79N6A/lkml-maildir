I think it's *much* harder to carry legacy things around in an old tree 
that almost nobody even uses any more (probably not true yet, but for most 
of the main developers, I bet it will be true in a year). Especially one 
that just duplicates 99% of the stuff.
There really isn't that much legacy crud. There are things like random 
quirks, but every time I hear the (theoretical) argument about how much 
time and effort we save by having it duplicated somewhere else, I think 
about all the time we definitely waste by fixing the same bug twice (and 
worry about the cases where we don't).
