well...
	struct blah *foo_ref = foo;
	... not using foo_ref ...
	foo_get(foo_ref);
	... using foo_ref ...
	foo_put(foo_ref);
versus
	struct blah *foo_ref;
	... not using foo_ref ...
	foo_ref = foo_get(foo);
	... using foo_ref ...
	foo_put(foo_ref);
I suppose it's a matter of taste rather than necessity.
As a tangent, if kobject_get is so small now, why not just make it 
static inline to optimize this case?
