I work with these all the time - it's power & data one one pin, and some 
kind of a ground.  They also make some in 3 terminal packages (pinouts can 
be had on the Maxim site). That said, I'm really pleased to see this in 
the kernel - as I'm in the process of developing all the firmware to port 
one of our product to use Linux! The application guys are way ahead of me, 
however...
Enjoy
