Hi,
Attached is a patch which stores the numa_node_id in a local variable
after disabling interrupts, in the cache_reap code path.
I was not able to reproduce the bug that Petr was talking about, but if
the cache reap threads do schedule across cpu's which might be the
problem here then this should just fix it. 
Andrew, i also have a patch which fixes the CPU_DOWN code path, which i
will send u later. 
Thanks & Regards,
Alok.

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make
it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way
is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
