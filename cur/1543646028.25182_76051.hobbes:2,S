Yes, moving parport_serial looked much simpler to me than moving serial
to its own directory (the proper solution, done in 2.5).  I hope others
can also agree to accept this low risk change for 2.4 in the meantime.
In some sense, parport_serial is not strictly part of neither serial nor
parport drivers - it is common to (uses the services of) both.

Well, the hardware itself is kind of a hack (not a clean design - no
separate PCI functions for serial and parallel ports; I guess that would
use a little more silicon and make the chip a few cents more expensive),
and that's the reason why the parport_serial driver exists at all...
Thanks,
Marek
