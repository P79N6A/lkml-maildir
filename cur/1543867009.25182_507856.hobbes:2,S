Newer Linux versions depending on the disk and the file system will tell
the disk to flush the buffers to disk on fsync. FreeBSD might or might not
do that, but if it doesn't it would explain the difference.

vfat is certainly not a performance optimized file system.

You could use oprofile (
http://oprofile.sourceforge.net
) to find out
where the CPU is being used.

I remember vaguely (but I might be wrong here) the standard block
character devices on FreeBSD are buffered, while raw is truly
unbuffered on Linux. Naive programs (no optimized IO threads or aio) 
on truly unbuffered devices tend to perform poorly because they
don't do any write behind.
It might also useful if you post the libata related parts of your
boot log.

Could be buffered vs unbuffered. Unbuffered single threaded writes
tend to be quite variable.

It's really hard to make raw io perform well without complicated
efforts because nobody will hide the IO latencies. That is why
buffered IO is normally recommend
