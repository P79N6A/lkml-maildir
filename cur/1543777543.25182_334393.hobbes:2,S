Out of curiosity, are there any cheap and 'embeddable' linux 
supported architectures which support such response times (User or 
kernel space)?
Would be very interested for a hobby project I'm planning 
(programmable digital ignition) which requires about 10usec 
resolution +/- 6us accuracy response times. At moment looks like this 
task will have to done on a dedicated microcontroller.
Input comes in at anywhere from 6kHz to 100kHz (variable), (T0 say), 
requirement is to assert an output line Ta seconds after each T0, Ta 
needs to be accurate to about 6us in the extreme case (how long the 
output is held has similar accuracy requirement).
What kind of hardware is capable of this? Even in microcontroller 
space it's difficult to do (eg looked at some ARM microcontrollers, 
which still have several usec of interrupt latency - even with no OS, 
still likely cant use timers and interrupts.).
