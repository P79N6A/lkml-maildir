Well, first of all, remap_page_range() is now deprecated, so some of
this might not even be relevant.  :) 
My only worry is that you might want *all* calls to
remap_page/pfn_range() to be to io_remap_page/pfn_range() for your
arch.  If this isn't the case, then there really isn't an issue.  And,
yes, mem.c is a mess.
Thanks for the explanation.
