I have some Firewire disk at work, and need to integrate this to the
standart local distribution ( Some scientist come in the institute I'm
working in , do their experiences, and must retrieve about 50Gigs, fast
,easly ... back to their home institute).
I would like to know the actual Firewire, Hotplug ... status.
Can someone help me with it ? Give me some pointers ?
