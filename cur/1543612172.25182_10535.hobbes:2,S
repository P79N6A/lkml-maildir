Hi all,
I get the message "kernel: Warning - running *really* short on DMA
buffers" frequently with medium to heavy disk i/o (running several
tar and/or moving huge directories).
Can anybody give me some hints what the reason for this might be
and how to avoid this condition.
Do you need more information (I'm using only SCSI disks attached
to a Symbios controller: <875> rev 0x26 on pci bus 0 device 11 func
tion 0 irq 15)? I even can't find this error string in the kernel
sources.
Thanks for your help.
Ado
