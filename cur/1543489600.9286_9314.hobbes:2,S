I tried several mp3 players - all seem to skip to some extent.
None of them ever skip except very occasionally on a busy system
in 2.0.x.  So therefore it is definitely something wrong, and not
an issue with a maxed out system or some such.

Suggestions for your CD problem:
cat the file to /dev/null prior to playing it.  It may likely
stay in buffer cache.  You might also want to try out a program
that changes your CD's spindown timer if the drive allows it.
Alternative to that, you can write a small script which runs
every X seconds which accesses a random sector on the CD.

I wrote the above having not read your whole message first.  ;o)
May I ask how you trashed your drive?  Was it a 2.2.x bug, or
just an accident?
