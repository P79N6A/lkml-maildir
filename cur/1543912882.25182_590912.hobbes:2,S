But doesn't GC only happen in prepare_write in the case that the
i_size is being extended into a new page?
If you GC the page in prepare_write (when it may be potentially
!uptodate), then I'm sure you would get a deadlock when read_cache_page
finds it non-uptodate and locks it for readpage().

OK. The patches are in -mm now, but could get in as early as 2.6.24.
If you have any suggestions about the form of the APIs, it would be
good to hear them.
