Right.

Right.  And many ways of disabling THM0._TMP fix the hang:
1. making acpi_evaluate_integer() not evaluate _TMP methods.
2. the short-term fix using acpi_in_suspend
3. taking out \_SB.PCI0.ISA0.EC0.UPDT () line from _TMP method.

I agree, and am testing the other thermal methods one at a time.  I
suspect that THMx.AC0 will be involved, but we'll see.
