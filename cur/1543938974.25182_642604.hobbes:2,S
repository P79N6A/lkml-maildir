This is a side effect of this rule:
	This does not apply if one branch of a conditional statement
	is a single statement. Use braces in both branches.
Basically each arm is being considered in isolation, each arm is seen as
having a "sibling" arm with braces so it is permitted to have braces.
Bugger.
I guess I'll try and see if I can detect this.

We could check for those ... will look to add in the next release.
