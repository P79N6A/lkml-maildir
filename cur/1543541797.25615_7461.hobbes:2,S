hi...
I'm running into a problem compiling reiserfs 3.6.12 with kernel
2.4.0-test7-pre4 on an alpha xl-300:
make[2]: Entering directory
`/usr/local/src/linux-2.4.0test7-pre4/fs/reiserfs'
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/local/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes
-O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -mno-fp-regs -ffixed-8 -Wa,-mev6
-fno-strict-aliasing -DMODULE -DMODVERSIONS -include
/usr/local/src/linux/include/linux/modversions.h
  -c -o namei.o namei.c
namei.c: In function `reiserfs_add_entry':
namei.c:442: `EHASHCOLLISION' undeclared (first use in this function)
namei.c:442: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
namei.c:442: for each function it appears in.)
make[2]: *** [namei.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory
`/usr/local/src/linux-2.4.0test7-pre4/fs/reiserfs'
make[1]: *** [_modsubdir_reiserfs] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/linux-2.4.0test7-pre4/fs'
make: *** [_mod_fs] Error 2
EHASHCOLLISION is only defined in include/asm-i386/errno.h, and not in
include/asm-alpha/errno.h - there the number 125 assigned to
EHASHCOLLISION in asm-i386 is already taken by ELIBMAX, so I'm unsure how
to fix it.

ps:
an unrealted side question - just curios:
what is CONFIG_INET_ECN (IP: TCP Explicit Congestion Notification
support) supposed to do (there is no help-page for it)?
