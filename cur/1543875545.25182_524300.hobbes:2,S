- This is the same as 2.6.12-rc5-mm1, except the staircase deadline CPU
  scheduler has been added.
Boilerplate:
- See the `hot-fixes' directory for any important updates to this patchset.
- To fetch an -mm tree using git, use (for example)
  git-fetch git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/smurf/linux-trees.git tag v2.6.16-rc2-mm1
  git-checkout -b local-v2.6.16-rc2-mm1 v2.6.16-rc2-mm1
- -mm kernel commit activity can be reviewed by subscribing to the
  mm-commits mailing list.
        echo "subscribe mm-commits" | mail majordomo@vger.kernel.org
- If you hit a bug in -mm and it is not obvious which patch caused it, it is
  most valuable if you can perform a bisection search to identify which patch
  introduced the bug.  Instructions for this process are at
        
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/bisecting-mm-trees.txt
  But beware that this process takes some time (around ten rebuilds and
  reboots), so consider reporting the bug first and if we cannot immediately
  identify the faulty patch, then perform the bisection search.
- When reporting bugs, please try to Cc: the relevant maintainer and mailing
  list on any email.
- When reporting bugs in this kernel via email, please also rewrite the
  email Subject: in some manner to reflect the nature of the bug.  Some
  developers filter by Subject: when looking for messages to read.
- Occasional snapshots of the -mm lineup are uploaded to
  
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/mm/
 and are announced on
  the mm-commits list.
