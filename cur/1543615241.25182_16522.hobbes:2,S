Subject: [PATCH] Make 2.5.2-pre6 usable

The attached patch is making the mentioned kernel usable by propagating the
kdev_t handling to much more dirvers.
Of esp. interrest is the fact that there where some places, where NODEV 
was used
instead of ENODEV:
linux-new/drivers/net/defxx.c
linux-new/fs/dquot.c
linux-new/drivers/media/video/cpia.c
