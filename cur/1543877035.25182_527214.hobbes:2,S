The problem with that approach was that it was being extended to more
and more drivers in the ARM world, creating an #ifdef mess in the
serial driver.
Moreover, it provided *no* way to select an 8250-based serial port in
the presence of a "foreign" port claiming the ttyS console namespace.
Utterly unacceptable when you have a real environment of mixed serial
port types.
IOW, it was utterly broken.  It prevented me from doing the things I
wanted to do.
The only real answer is to fix the problem *properly*.  Hacks just end
up breaking peoples setups.
