The name of the operation region, SMIP, suggests that the BIOS has an 
SMI trap on that port. In that case, writing to that port will result in 
the BIOS taking control. We have little idea what it could be doing. 
Could be it's trying to access the OHCI controller which has been 
suspended already.
This sounds kind of like the Toshiba laptops that go nuts somewhere if 
the AHCI SATA controller gets put into suspend state before the system 
suspends..
The ACPI spec has the following to say about the _PTS method:
"The platform must not make any assumptions about the state of the 
machine when _PTS is called. For example, operation region accesses that 
require devices to be configured and enabled may not succeed, as these 
devices may be in a non-decoding state due to plug and play or power 
management operations."
I would guess some BIOS writers failed to heed this..

Yeah, and this is a PCI Express system not AGP, so it wouldn't load anyway.
