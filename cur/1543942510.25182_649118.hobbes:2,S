keep thread to keep comments coming.
But always when posting the updated patch include the full
changelog. Document whats done since last posting
below your s-o-b and the '---'.
Then it is so much easier to apply your patch.
As this is an arm patch maybe you would just re-add the changelog
when posting to the patch system but in all other list this rule
apply.
