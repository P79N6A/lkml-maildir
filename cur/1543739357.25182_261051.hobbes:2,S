	Yes, though that would obviously be a very poor implementation.

	Like a TCP 'write'.

	While this is true, there is an 'as if' here. There's no difference to the
application between a datagram that dropped and a datagram that got
corrupted in transit.

	But it would block if the UDP datagram had been dropped after the 'select'
hit but before the 'recvmsg'. There is no logical reason there should be a
semantic difference between a UDP packet that was dropped and a UDP packet
that was corrupted.

	There is no *application* difference between a dropped packet and a corrupt
packet. If the packet was dropped, it would have been readable.

	I have never seen anyone recommend anything different. Every time this
comes up, it astonishes me that anyone would ever use 'select' on a blocking
file descriptor except in the very special case where you plan to change it
to non-blocking before performing the I/O operation. There are so many well
known corner cases, TCP write being one, UDP discard due to memory pressure
being another, connection abort being yet another.

	There is no difference to the application between a UDP packet that was
discarded due to memory pressure in-between a 'select' hit and a packet that
was received with a bad checksum. If you can write an application that can
detect the difference, do so. Then I'll agree with you. Until that time,
this argument fails due to the 'as if' rule. If the API can perform
identically under conditions that do not differ as far as the application is
concerned, then the behavior is legal.
