At least the weird in_interrupt_stack() code seems to be still
in there.
I also still see a lot of open coded hex manipulation.
The synchronization code looks as bad as it was before.
The getthread magic pids are also still in there. What is that
good for?  
The notifiers are also still run with interrupts enabled,
so could in theory be preempted (only in some very exotic cases though)
The cpu hotplug races are still there I think
I have not rechecked everything else.
