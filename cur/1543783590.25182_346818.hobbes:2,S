Ahh... ack. :) That explains it.

I really did see very small values. This one is plucked from one of 
today's streams, after a full day's worth of data had passed through it:
19:03:19.659454 10.1.12.11.8001 > 10.2.10.212.56690: P 3:6(3) ack 1 win 65529 <nop,nop,timestamp 27146219 3617561665> (DF)

10.1.12.11 is the Win2k box, 10.2.10.212 is the Linux box. The socket 
buffer sizes are the defaults, so the scaling is most likely 2^2. The 
packets being exchanged at this point are just heartbeats.
On Tuesday I can try to capture a full session from the very begining, if 
you think it would help.
Thanks,
