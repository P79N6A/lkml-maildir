In some 32bit bigendian systems you need to do address-swapping before doing any
16 bit (or 8 bit) PCI accesses, whereas 32 bit (full bus width) doesn't need any
swapping, and therefor it would be more efficient.

I got the same issue on one of my platforms, the firmware setup the chip to DWIO
and the only thing that will bring it back to WIO is a hardware reset.
