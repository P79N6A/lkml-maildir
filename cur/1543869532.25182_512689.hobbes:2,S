No, it absolutely is a matter of speed.  The reason to have those two  
implemented that way is so that they can be implemented as vsyscalls  
completely in userspace.  This means that on most modern platforms  
you can implement the "make a threadlet when I block" semantic  
without even touching kernel-mode.  The way it's set up all you'd  
have to do is save some parameters, set up a new callstack, and poke  
a "1" into a memory address in the TLS.  To stop, you effectively  
just poke a "0" into the spot in the TLS and either return or  
terminate the thread.
