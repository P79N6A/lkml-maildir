Ok, my bad.
I wasn't offended, just curious, which one of the suggestions would be
the best.  Jamie's idea of using -H looks better to me than yours, but
maybe I have missed something, so I asked.
For some reason, I often miss the tone.  Any emotional stuff in my
posts is unintended, useless and should be removed before sending.
Sorry!
Jörn
PS: So, does your idea have advantages over Jamie's that I missed?
