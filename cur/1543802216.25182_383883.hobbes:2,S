As Vatsa noted, this is needed if the CPU-hotplug case moves
from ->donelist to ->donelist.  It could be omitted if CPU-hotplug
instead moves from ->donelist to ->nextlist, as is the case in Oleg's
patch.  The extra grace-period delay should not be a problem for the
presumably rare hotplug case, but:
o	the extra test in __rcu_pending() should be quite inexpensive,
	since the cacheline is already loaded given the earlier tests.
o	although tasklet_schedule() looks to be perfectly reliable
	right now, and although any bugs in tasklet_schedule() must
	be fixed, having RCU leakage be the major symptom of
	tasklet_schedule() failure sounds quite unfriendly to me.
So I am not (yet) convinced that this patch is the way to go.
						Thanx, Paul
