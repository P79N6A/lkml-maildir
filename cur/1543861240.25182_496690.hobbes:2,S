Hm, a number of the "odd" settings might not work on the usb-serial
converters, as they can't do them (or the driver doesn't know how to
configure the chip to do that.)
The pl2303 driver was reverse engineered by looking at data from other
operating systems, so perhaps no one has added that mode to it.
