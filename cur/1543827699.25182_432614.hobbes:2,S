Well, arguably, we shouldn't necessarily have defaults that use window 
scaling, or we should have ways to recognize automatically when it 
doesn't work (which may not be possible).
It's not like there aren't broken boxes out there, and it might be better 
to make the default buffer sizes just be low enough that window scaling 
simply isn't an issue.
I suspect that the people who really want/need window scaling know about 
it, and could be assumed to know enough to raise their limits, no?
