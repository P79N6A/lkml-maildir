Yep. This is one of the reasons we need to move the bio_set stuff from dm-io.c 
to bio.c so it becomes much easier for DM and other drivers to create new 
mempools for bios. Obviously you're already pondering that. :)

Well, yes and no. One incoming write can kick off a chunk-copy, but additional 
incoming writes to that same chunk will be queued on the already-in-progress 
copy job. And yes, we allocate new bios to do the copying of these chunks, 
but those bios come from the private bio pools in dm-io.c, not the global 
pool. And the bio for the read side of the copy is released back to the pool 
before the write side of the copy begins.
Another thing I just noticed is that each snapshot device pre-allocates a 
fixed number of pages (currently #define'd to 256) to actually hold chunk 
data that is being copied. This means that only a limited number of 
chunk-copies can be going on at a time, since kcopyd will effectively stop 
processing copy jobs for that snapshot until some of those data pages are 
freed (when a copy completes). This means the congestion could be even worse 
than I originally anticipated, since we aren't even driving all the possible 
copy jobs that we could be.
Also, kcopyd and dm-io certainly don't seem to be considering any of the 
congestion info from the lower-level devices, since they aren't going through 
the page-cache. They're just putting together bios and sending them down with 
submit_bio(). Not sure what kind of affect that is going to have.
Now my head is spinning. :)

Yep, that sounds pretty similar to what I just told akpm. :)  I really should 
read through the whole thread before replying to individual posts.
Obviously DM's congestion handling needs some work. See my earlier reply for 
my thoughts on how we might do this.
