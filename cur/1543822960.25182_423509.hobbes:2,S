ho-hum.  Please see if there's anything else you can do to rule out a
hardware failure, then copy dm-devel@redhat.com on the next oops report.
The stack backtrace you have there is a little surprising.  Enabling
CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER might help clear it up.  Also it'd be worth seeing if
CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB turns up anything.
Thanks.
