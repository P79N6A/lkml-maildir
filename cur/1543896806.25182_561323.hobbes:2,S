there is no such guarantee at all (of 'instant preemption'), even with 
current, softirq-based tasklets. A tasklet might be 'stolen' by another 
CPU. It might be delayed to the next timer tick (or other softirq 
execution). Or it might be delayed into a ksoftirqd context, which 
currently runs at nice +19. So your worry of implicit execution 
dependencies is unfounded, because, if they existed, they would be bad 
(and triggerable) bugs today too.
