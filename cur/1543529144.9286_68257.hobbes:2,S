Os/2 has the same priority boost for interactivity.  You can't really do
that in bash, as a non-root bash can't raise its priority above normal.
(If it could, all sorts of programs would do that in order to look like
top performers.)  
I believe you can get this effect today by starting all processes with
a slightly lower priority (use nice), except for bash and X at normal.
You might get a more NT-like effect by modifying the keyboard driver to
raise the priority of whatever process receives keystrokes, but that
will
help the console only.  A telnet/ssh user wouldn't benefit.
