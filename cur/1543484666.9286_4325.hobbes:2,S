IBM *has* made some concessions, though --- they freed up the Rx RPC
library, else Arla and Coda would have been impossible.  They've also
refrained from declaring ownership of AFS version 2, which is the basis
for Coda.
By and large, however, the AFS3 situation is now too entrenched on all
sides.  I don't expect to see any serious changes (of the open source/
free software variety) from IBM/Transarc, and Arla's not quite ready for
deployment in production environments (getting there, yes, but not quite
there yet).

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
