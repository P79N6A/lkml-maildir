Why? Can't lookup() notice the change in remote st_dev as you cross the
filesystem boundary?
For NFS the plan is to automatically submount such remote
subfilesystems. That fixes a host of problems including the one that you
mention w.r.t. statfs, the problem of potential duplicate inode numbers,
etc.
