There used to be an "lspnp" buried in the pcmcia-cs package.  That
package seems to be obsolete, and it's now a strange place for PNP
utilities anyway.
So I pulled out lspnp and setpnp from pcmcia-cs and put them together
in a little "pnputils" package.
I also extended it slightly, so lspnp will work for ISAPNP and
PNPACPI devices in addition to PNPBIOS, and added a few PNP device
IDs.  setpnp still only works for PNPBIOS.
