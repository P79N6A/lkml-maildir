check the bootmessage with dmesg right after the box boots up , you can't 
tell from the size of vmlinuz because the amount of allocated kernel memory
depends on your hardware and on the memory available (reserved + data will
change) . dmesg will give you something like:
....snip
Calibrating delay loop... 349.80 BogoMIPS
Memory: 128120k/131072k available (976k kernel code, 412k reserved, 1508k data, 56k init)
CPU: AMD AMD-K6tm w/ multimedia extensions stepping 02
...snip
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
Freeing unused kernel memory: 56k freed
so in this case the kernel code is 976k
but this may change depending on modules inserted and things like that ,but
this should give you a good approximation.
