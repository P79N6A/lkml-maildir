OK, thanks.
It seems like the thing to do to be fully safe might be to have
ipath_get() (just rename ipath_lookup) and ipath_put() functions.  Embed
a kref inside ipath_devdata, and have ipath_dev_get increment the ref
count on both the ipath_devdata and the pci_dev.
Is that sane, or am I way off base?

I understand that.  In practice, though, I think this is not a good
approach in many of the cases we're dealing with.  Every use of
ipath_max iterates over all devices for a reason.
For example, the diag open routine wants to find at least one device
that's up.  We could maintain a separate list of devices that are in the
state that it needs, so that it can just get the first entry off that
list or fail if the list is empty, but that's more complex than simply
iterating over every device and checking each one.

Probably not much.  The motivation was to ensure that if it got
incremented during an iteration, whoever was iterating would see the
update in a timely fashion.

Yes, that code ought to be restructured.
Thanks for the helpful feedback.
