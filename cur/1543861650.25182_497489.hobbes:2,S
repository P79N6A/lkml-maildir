Subject: ext3 file system went read-only in 2.6.18.2 (plus hacks)

First, this kernel is tainted by one of my proprietary patches
and also has my other non-proprietary patches applied, so please
ignore as you wish.  My patches do not (purposefully) affect the file-system.
The system is a via/c3 system running a fairly stripped down FC5
installation on a 1GB CF disk.  We've been using this platform
for over a year and this is the first file system error we've
seen.  It could easily be that the CF is funky, but I thought
I'd post the message in case it proves to be something else.

After restarting and a manual fsck, the system appears to
be back to normal.
Thanks,
