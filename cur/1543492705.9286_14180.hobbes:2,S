Hi everyone ,
	 I wanted to know wether linux can instead of having a static
size swap have a dynamic size swap . That is if there is disk space
available that is there is no valid data , that could be used for swap .
Static swap also has a problem that when I increase my ram the swap also
has to be increased for faster performance but cant be done because the
partitions are all made . I want to know wether any attempts are being
made along this front . I am an enthusiastic programmer and would like to
contribute for the above . Please mail me as I am not a member of this
group .
						Pramod .
