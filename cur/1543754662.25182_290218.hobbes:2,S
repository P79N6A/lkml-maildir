No, there is no "parent".
Each logical device is "shared" between several superio chips.
It is presented design.

It is not the same as two different devices on the bus.
Consider sc1100 - GPIO lives in PCI aperture, absolutely not where
superio lives.
(And it is actully not logical device in this case, but it fits well
into design).
You skipped my examples, but presented design is very convenient to the
situation,
when you have two different sets of devices, or classes of devices, each
of which
can have link to any device from the other set.
