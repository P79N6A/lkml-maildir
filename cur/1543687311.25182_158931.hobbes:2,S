Maybe I'm missing something but -- isn't it perfectly valid to assume the
node *ITSELF* knows about its interfaces, IP addresses, and its routes?
(Certainly, it can't know of what subnets exist on the LAN if those
haven't been configured on the node, e.g. in the form of an "interface
routes".)
ARP could look it up.
Sure, it would seem a bit like an OSI layering violation, but that's no 
news as OSI layering isn't strict anyway and has been shredded to pieces 
already in many other places.
