In the interactive mode, you can select the "last used cpu" field to display.
or you can use /proc/pid/stat

Because of the highest priority task, weighted load of that cpu
will be > SCHED_LOAD_SCALE. Because of this, an idle cpu in 
find_busiest_group() thinks that there is an imbalance.. This is due to
the code near the comment "however we may be able to increase 
total CPU power used by ...". That piece of code assumes that a unit load
is represented by SCHED_LOAD_SCALE (which is no longer true with smpnice)
and finally results in "pwr_move > pwr_now".. This will make the idle cpu
try to pull that process from busiest cpu and the process will ultimately move
with the help of active load balance...

Yes. We need to fix the code I mentioned above too.... And please make sure
it doesn't break HT optimizations as this piece of code is mainly used
for implementing HT optimizations..
