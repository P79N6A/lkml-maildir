btw, you may want to see the IDE_TCQ_FIDDLE_SI define in ide-tcq, here's
the comment I put there:
/*
 * we are leaving the SERVICE interrupt alone, IBM drives have it
 * on per default and it can't be turned off. Doesn't matter, this
 * is the sane config.
 */
#undef IDE_TCQ_FIDDLE_SI
Are you sure this isn't what you are seeing?
