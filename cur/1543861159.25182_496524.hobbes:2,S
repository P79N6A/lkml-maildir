That wasn't meant for resending. If you resend the whole series it's good to 
start a new thread. But if you have several related patches (usually this 
[PATCH N/xx] thing) it helps if you either send a 0/xx first describing the 
whole series or at least sending everything as reply to 1/xx. This way the 
mail program will help everybody by keeping this things together.
