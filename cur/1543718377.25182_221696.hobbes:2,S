Hi!
I'm currently playing with patches for gcc HEAD to build a vax-linux
cross-compiler. For testing it, I first want to build parts of the
kernel with my HEAD toolchain, Ctrl-C, and continue/finish building with
my old compiler (2.95.2).
I do changing gcc by putting one or the other gcc into $PATH. However,
whenever I change GCC, kbuild decides to rebuild everything.
I tried to not overwrite compile.h (my commenting out the mv command in
scripts/mkcompile_h), but that didn't help either. I even tried
recompiling my HEAD gcc with exactly the same version string that my old
gcc had, but that didn't work either:(
How can I force to keep my old .o files?
MfG, JBG
