The problem is that the kernel is not a 'process'. For a file descriptor
to mean anything, it has to be associated with a process. Basically, in
UNIX, when a user wants the kernel to do something, i.e., write to
a file, the kernel does this in the context of the current process.
Some procedure, linked into the kernel, that needs to use a file-
descriptor, would end up creating the file in the context of whatever
process currently was running, then when the write actually occurs either
to buffers or the physical device, the task may 'sleep' while this is
done. Sleep, in this meaning, means to give the CPU to some other task
while hardware or even the memory manager (paging, swapping, etc.) is
busy.
After control is returned, the state of the kernel will have changed.
The result is undefined.
You can use a 'kernel thread' to establish process context in the kernel.
However, it is easier to write an installable driver that saves all
the kernel information that you intend to acquire in a buffer it
allocates/deallocates in the kernel.
A user-mode program (daemon) periodically queries the driver for its
data. You do all your file I/O in the context of a user.
