Not if "init" is a particular program running on a router floppy for
example.  The system may be designed to be a router and the userland
monitor/control program is the only thing that runs and consumes 90% of the
memory.  If a forked or spawned process starts up with high CPU that just
tips it over the OOM edge, we don't really want to kill init even if it's
taking "all" the memory and or "all" the cpu.
