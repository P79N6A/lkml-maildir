In the future you may want to provide a little more information, e.g. what
error you're getting, kernel version, etc.
One thing I ran into is that I originally had the processing sending the
file descriptors using an empty iovec[] array and as a result it appeared 
to unix_stream_sendmsg() that the message contained no data.  If you don't
have it already, I highly recommend Richard Steven's "Unix Network
Programming: Volume 1", he covers this topic in section 14.7.
Good luck,
Pat
