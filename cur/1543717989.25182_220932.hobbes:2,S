Hi All,
Just a quick "me too" here - though symptoms don't appear to be 
identical.  Running 2.6.6 on Debian Sid and using nvidia binary modules. 
  My system doesn't hang, but when I get the log message "cdrom: 
dropping to single frame dma" ripping stops working.  It still rips but 
I get silence - it will rip the track OK, as in read through the correct 
track length, but I get silence on the resulting wav file.
Please let me know if I can let you have any information about this problem.
Kind regards,
Phil
