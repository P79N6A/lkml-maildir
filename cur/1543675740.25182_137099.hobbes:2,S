   but on a single processor machine (i.e. #undef CONFIG_SMP) there is
   no chance that there will be reads/writes from other processors so
   i dont need any locking OR protection from interrupts.
Either you need to pretect a code sequence from an IRQ context
execution while holding the lock or you don't. :-)
Really, all your macros just make the driver that much less
portable.  And I don't see what you'll gain by having interrupts
enabled for such short sequences of code on uniprocessor.
