That's your point??  I thought your point was (quoting your words)

To repeat -- that's how most Linux drivers have been written, 
/particularly/ the ones used most by users of enterprise distros.

Mikael took care of it already.  And its supported by enterprise distros.

Yep.  Without docs, even.  And its supported by enterprise distros.

How so?  They appear to be working with wireless devs to get their 
driver into the tree.

Yes, large chunks of legacy ISA drivers, m68k drivers, and similar 
situations where the userbase has dwindled to a handful over a decade.
