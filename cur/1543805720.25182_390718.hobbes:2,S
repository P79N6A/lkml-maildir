Could you tell me more about the new generic {set,clear,test}_bit()
routines?
Why do you copied these routines from parisc and employed them
 as generic ones?
I'm not sure whether these generic {set,clear,test}_bit() routines
are really generic or not.

Is there a possibility that these routines affect for archs
with no HAVE_ARCH_ATOMIC_BITOPS for SMP ?
I think __raw_spin_lock() is sufficient and local_irqsave() is 
not necessary in general atomic routines.
If the parisc's LDCW instruction required disabling interrupts,
it would be parisc specific and not generic case, I think, 
although I'm not familier with the parisc architecture...
