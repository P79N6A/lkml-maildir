I'm afraid this really isn't practical.  Each webserver handles well
over 100 requests/second at peak times, and goes days between crashes.
It also communicates with hundreds of different servers.  We can't
possibly tcpdump every single packet, even in the most skeletal form,
and even if the webservers didn't have other work to do.

And flushing after every line would be even more expensive.
