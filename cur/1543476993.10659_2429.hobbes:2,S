Subject: 2.2.0p7: fix to ioperm() ranges also needed

Hi,
The pre-patch for 2.2.0p7 includes a fix I suggest so that an iopl(3)
process can drop privs to iopl(0) without needing to be root to do so!
As a complementary fix, processes should probably always be allowed to use
ioperm() if they specify 0 as the "set" argument.
Cheers
Chris
P.S. Offtopic. Can someome clarify for me the differences between iopl(1),
iopl(2) and iopl(3)? Thank you!
