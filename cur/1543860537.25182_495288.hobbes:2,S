|  I think that git does not like year rollover.  I've tried it after Linus 
|  sent message out, and it was not giving me anything new (cca from 5PM 
|  PST when Linus sent change to 8PM).  Then it gave out random changes 
|  (8PM to 9PM).  After that it was dead, as you've noticed.  But after 
|  that I was able to get 2.6.20-rc3 out - compiling now.   So perhaps just 
|  try it again...

Yea, I've got linux git clone later. I think that was some files activity
on git server so that is why I was noticed with "fatal: unexpected EOF" git
message.
