The problem is that deadlocks can happen even without anybody
running out of virtual memory.  The deadlocks GFP_CRITICAL 
was supposed to handle are deadlocks while swapping out data
because the swapping on some devices needs more memory by itself.
This happens long before anything is running into a true oom. 
It's just that the memory cleaning stage cannot make progress
anymore.
Your proposal isn't addressing this problem at all I think.
Handling true OOM is a quite different issue.
