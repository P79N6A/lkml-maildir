It tells you the chipset doesnt support an IDE dma timeout handling function
(ie all it can do is reset and retry)

Not in my experience. Its just a drive throwing a fit.

I've only seen it on broken boards that also needed DMA off in 2.2 and
on the VIA stuff before the VIA fixups went in and the new via driver.

We issued a DMA, the drive sat their and did nothing. The default handler 
asks the controller handling the request to retry it in PIO mode. Which is
readonable. On the 440BX this uses disable_irq which may also trigger a bug
in the APIC on SMP machines and hang solid unless you have -ac. I dont think
thats statistically likely here.
The code looks correct, its a bit convoluted but it does seem to correctly
reissue the request, although not as PIO. Perhaps Andre can explain why its
ignoring the 'please use pio' hint on the return
