You might be recalling something called libcpumemset, which is about
five years old.  The library known as libcpuset is SGI's current LGPL
library for use with Linux 2.6 cpusets.

We were discussing libnuma here, not glibc.  The system call wrappers
are in glibc.  System call wrappers should not be setting optional
flags.  They should just make the system call -- do whatever magic it
takes to get the provided arguments into the right registers or other
conventionally determined places, and invoke the necessary machine
instruction to trap into the kernel.
