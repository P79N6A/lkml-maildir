I've discussed this with him.
The performance degradation was real and it was the result of
poor code generation for the address calculation of the page address.
Apparently this toolchain performance issue made driver calls that use
page_address() within it very expensive. The size reduction won't
provide as significant of benefits on 64-bit machines as it does on
32-bit machines with highmem (36-bit stuff like PAE), so it makes sense
(perhaps like 64-bit SPARC) that there may be 64-bit architectures that
will not care to use it. On the other hand, I suspect there are similar
issues on other 64-bit architectures that are the true culprit with
respect to this.

He is unlikely to see these detrimental effects on i386. It's
possible waitqueue collisions could happen in highly threaded
tests, but that is a different issues.

Triplefault well prior to console output being visible to the naked eye.
