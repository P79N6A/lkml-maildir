I really don't think it existed.
Maybe there's something else going on. In particular, I wonder if sections 
like the "debug_loc" fection end up being counted towards text-size? They 
never actually get _loaded_, but they can be absolutely enormous if 
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO is enabled.
Doing "make allnoconfig" would have turned off not only modules, but also 
indirectly turned off gratuitous debug info bloat like that..
