In fact, we used to allow them.
We do want to remove it from the page cache under normal circumstances: it
makes for much better MM behaviour (ie free pages that are truly useless).
But I suspect that just adding a test for "page_count(page) == 1" (ie same
as for the page cache invalidation) before freeing it should give that
advantage, along with avoiding the problematic unlikely case...
