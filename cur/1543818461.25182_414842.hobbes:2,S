Just an additional thought on this idea... both VGA and DVI connectors 
on modern video cards appear to have DDC-2 connections, which is in fact 
I2C.  This would provide an (inherently bidirectional :-) ) 3-pin 
digital interface out of a mostly dead box even on laptops and so on 
with no serial, parallel or legacy keyboard/mouse, so long as they had 
reasonably modern VGA or DVI out.  You would need to get access to the 
two I2C pins and Gnd somehow in that scenario.   Since I2C has a concept 
of addressing it should be possible to choose I2C addresses for this 
communication that doesn't address whatever may be listening on the same 
bus in the monitor.
I don't know if you bitbang these or there is some kind of 
shifter/management logic in the video chip, in which case some minimal 
case by case support is needed, but since simple IO is otherwise all but 
gone on modern laptops so I thought it worth mentioning.
