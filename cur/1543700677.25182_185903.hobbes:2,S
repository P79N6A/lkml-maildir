The U.S. LZW patent expired June 20, 2003.  The Canadian LZW
patent expiref July 7, 2004.  The LZW patents in the United
Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy however are still active, and
will expire June 18, 2004.  The Japanese LZW patent will expire
on June 20, 2004. 
I vote for keeping the status quo for another 4 months....
