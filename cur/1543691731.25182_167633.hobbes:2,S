I'm planning to looking into building external modules as next step.
Linus just merged the "Separate output directory" patch, and
proper support for external modules is a natural next step.
So if nothing shows up in the next few days I wil try looking into that.
I have a few mails saved on the topic, but the above was also good inputs.
