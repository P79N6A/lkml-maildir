Already reported, but I'll do so once again, since it looks like
  in a short while I won't be able to boot official kernels in my
  current config...
Original report here:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0312.3/0442.html
Please advise whether I should give up cpufreq for now - I really
  don't want to bang my head against a wall.
Thanks in advance,
