With upstream 2.6.x having been frozen for a while (and will be until 
end of week or so), a bunch of net driver updates have accumulated.
Even though the shortlog output is attached, here's an even shorter summary:
* acenic converted to PCI API (yay!).  Please test.
* new 10gige driver, s2io
* Francois work on r8169, epic100, sis190: PCI DMA, NAPI, other minor 
fixes and cleanups
* 8139cp, pcnet32 updates
* other minor stuff
