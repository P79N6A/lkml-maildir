If you insert enough levels, you are in another form of madness.
There should be a way of saying "This must be initialized after this, and
before that" (the "before that" might perhaps be taken care of by the
"that" itself). Spiced with a few "barriers": "Networking inited", etc.

Yes, I know this has been proposed before and been thrown out (for no good
reason, AFAICS)
