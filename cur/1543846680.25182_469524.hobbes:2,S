I disagree. It's perfectly valid for a disk not to have a partition
table (for example: components of a RAID5 MD device) and we shouldn't
scare users about that. Also an unrecognised partition table format
(DEC VMS, Novell Netware, etc.) is not a reason to throw an error, it's
just unrecognised and as far as the kernel knows it's unpartioned.
It's OK to tell the user that there was some kind of device error when
scanning the partition table but IMHO an unpartitioned disk is not a
device error.
