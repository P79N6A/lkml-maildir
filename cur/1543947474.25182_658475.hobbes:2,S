That summarizes well how I do original development, too.  Whether its a 
branch of an existing repo, or a newly cloned repo, when working on new 
code I will do a first pass, committing as I go to provide useful 
checkpoints.
Once I reach a satisfactory state, I'll refactor the patches so that 
they make sense for upstream submission.
