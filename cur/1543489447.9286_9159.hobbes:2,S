I've resynced my patch with the 2.2.3 tree, Most of the diffs from the
earlier patches would have applied to 2.2.3 without problems, but this
one works better.

Differences between Linux 2.2.3-dj1 and 2.2.3
o       arch/i386/kernel/apm.c
        Removed two unused vars.
o       arch/sparc64/kernel/cpu.c
        Corrected typo "Unknow CPU"
o       drivers/char/nvram.c
        o Removed leading space from hd0 type.
        o Added recognition for 2.88M 3.5" drive.
o       drivers/net/ne2k-pci.c
        Added support for DLink CT528 (
http://www.dlink.com
)
        This ugly is a clone of a RealTek 8029, which is a clone of an
	NE2k. Most bizarre. Even more bizarre, they used almost the same
	PCI info, so adding code to read the subsystem was necessary.
o       drivers/pci/quirks.c
        o Added bridge optimisation for VIA VT82C597AT chipset.
        o Fullstops added to some strings that had them missing.
        I think it's now agreed that this feature will disappear in 2.3.x
	as this really belongs in userland. Until such a program is
	available however, I will continue to maintain this.
        Problem is that setpci isn't up to the task right now, as it needs
        features such as write-masks, detection of hardware, reading &
        setting patch files and a few other things. Whilst these things
	can mostly be done by calling setpci several times from a shell
	script, that's by no means an ideal solution. I'm considering
	hacking a combination of the setpci code and the code from the
	kernel into a hybrid userland program that will autodetect the
	bridge, and apply the appropriate patches.
o       lib/vsprintf.c
        Now prints strings with '%%' in them as '%'.
        Should stop strange texts appearing in /var/log/messages.
Things not present in 223dj1 that were in 222dj2. (Abandoned patches).
o       arch/i386/kernel/setup.c
        CPU stepping no longer prints leading zero.
        Alan Cox mentioned that such unnecessary tidying is pretty
	pointless, and as there is no standard way of representing
	steppings, I've dropped this patch.
o       arch/i386/kernel/time.c
        Changed CPU speed reporting from Hz to MHz.
	Yes okay, all CPUs run in Hz too, but I thought this made
	things a little simpler.
        Alan mentioned that some programs rely upon the value printed at
	startup. Personally, I still don't get this, as I only altered the
	print statement that outputs xxxMhz at boot time. Any program that
	greps dmesg output (or /var/log/messages) for such a value instead
	of reading /proc/cpuinfo deserves to break IMHO, but... Well, Alan
	has been doing this stuff a lot longer than I have, so I'll trust
	his judgement :)
Regards,
Dave.
