Yes, largely.

This historical meaning as far as I can tell, for MS_INVALIDATE really 
_forgets_ the old mmap'ped contents in a non-coherent system.
Quoting from a UNIX man-page (as found by google):
	...
     If flags is MS_INVALIDATE,  the  function  synchronizes  the
     contents  of  the  memory  region  to match the current file
     contents.
        o  All writes to the mapped  portion  of  the  file  made
           prior  to  the  call  are  visible  by subsequent read
           references to the mapped memory region.
        o  All write references prior to the call,  by  any  pro-
           cess,  to memory regions mapped to the same portion of
           the file using MAP_SHARED, are visible by read  refer-
           ences to the region.
	...
now, it's confusing, but I read that as meaning that the mmap'ed region is 
literally thrown away, and that anybody who has done a "write()" call will 
have their recently written data show up. That's also what the naming 
("invalidate") suggests.
In a non-coherent system (and remember, that's what old UNIX was, when 
MS_INVALIDATE came to be), you -cannot- reasonably synchronize your caches 
any other way than by throwing away your own cached copy.
(Think non-coherent CPU caches in the old non-coherent NUMA machines that 
happily nobody makes any more - same exact deal. The cache ops are either 
"writeback" or "throw away" or a combination of the two.)
So I don't think MS_INVALIDATE has ever really meant what you say it 
means: it certainly hasn't meant it in Linux, and it cannot really have 
meant it in old UNIX either because the kind of op that you imply of a 
two-way coherency simply wasn't _possible_ in original unix..
Now, the "msync(0)" case _could_ very sanely mean "just synchronize with 
the page cache".
