Quite true on this point.

For ATA drives the bios handles this.

NO! What needs to happen is:
1) the person who installs a second scsi card should read the manual BEFORE
installing it so they know how to disable the boot features if they aren't
needed,
or
2) install only one bootable scsi card, period.
 Anything else is a useless kludge that will come back and bite us in the
ass.

It seems to work well enough.
