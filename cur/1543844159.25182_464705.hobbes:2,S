x86-64 did it for some time statically to replace mem copies and some other
functions. Basically it just patches the beginning of the other function
to a jump. However this assumes that the code doesn't contain absolute addresses
(e.g. no switches). In the x86-64 it's easy because only assembly functions
are threated this way.
