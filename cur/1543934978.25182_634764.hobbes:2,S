You said:
"The graphic UIs including menuconfig currently work best for tree-like 
 dependencies"
That's true.
And the dependency graph can't be a tree.
Currently, defining the ordered tree the UIs present to the user is done 
_once_ in kconfig.
Our UIs either show this tree as a tree or go through the tree 
depth-first and present the options in this order to the user.
And I think your main misunderstanding is that you think the 
dependencies alone would carry enough information for allowing an UI to 
present the options in a way not worse than it's currently done - that's 
simply not true.
