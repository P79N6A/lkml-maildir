Users are even more unhappy with ever-changing ABIs -- such as the
kernel taking away RDTSC.
RDTSC+perfctr [Pettersson] still is the fastest way for user-mode code
to count something that is highly correlated with both "billable"
CPU time and "code quality" for a fixed task.  With a little care
RDTSC is close enough to monotonic that I find it very useful.
Please don't take away user-mode RDTSC.
