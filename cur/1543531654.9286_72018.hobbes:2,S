Actually there's "2.5 check current->need_resched".  You only lose if an
interrupt happens between 2.5 and 3, which is about 7 instructions
long.
For system calls, interrupts are not disabled at all.
I prepared a patch which fixes this in the nested interrupt -- when
returning to kernel space, if you're returning to those 7 instructions,
trigger a recheck of current->need_resched.  It's quite efficient
because it doesn't impact all the normal code paths.
Ingo produced a nice and very small patch which simply disables
interrupts between 2.5 and the iret.  That has overhead for syscall, but
let us see that the problem does occur and is fixed by doing this.
My patch can now be found in Ingo's grand low-latency patch.
have a nice day,
