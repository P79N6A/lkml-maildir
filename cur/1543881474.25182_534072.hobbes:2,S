Mine's a:
SiS 661/741/760 PCI/AGP or 662/761Gx PCIE VGA Display adapter according 
to X's display settings tool.  Which category does that fall into?
It's not a special adapter and is just the one that came with the 
motherboard. It doesn't use much CPU unless I grab a window and wiggle 
it all over the screen or do something like "ls -lR /" in an xterm.

Which still doesn't justify an elaborate "points" sharing scheme. 
Whichever way you look at that that's just another way of giving X more 
CPU bandwidth and there are simpler ways to give X more CPU if it needs 
it.  However, I think there's something seriously wrong if it needs the 
-19 nice that I've heard mentioned.  You might as well just run it as a 
real time process.
