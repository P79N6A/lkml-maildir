	If it *really* came thru vger (HTML in it ?), then
	that address would be   postmaster@vger.kernel.org
	Even if it didn't, at least I am curious at what
	you really got.  (Same address.)
	Do remember to forward *ALL* headers.  The all revealing
	trace data is carried in "Received:" headers, after all,
	and most common email clients seem to make it extremely
	hard to see those.   (And I limit myself at that, one
	particular vendor screws up email STANDARDS so bad that
	you really would not believe me anyway...)

	"click on email and find an image" ?
	Oh no, you do use HTML displaying "email clients"..
	I see never anything such, but then I am an "old-fart"
	who thinks that HTML has no license to be in email in
	the first place.
