I don't think you need a /proc/NNN/namespace, /proc/NNN/mounts already
contains a mount table.  It's pretty trivial to write a small shellscript
to parse that, compare with the current namespace and do all mount/umounts
to make them fit the other processes namespace.  Real problem here are
filesystems that don't implement ->show_options or do so only partially
so that some options are lost.
