Just that that sounds very fragile ;) setuid-libraries... well...

That might be the case, but my concern is not POSIX but security, an
orthogonal concept. Lax handling of STOP is a big security problem, even
with the process-only model (see the many programs that suffice to survive
KILL or SOTP for some time), and with threads it only gets easier.
