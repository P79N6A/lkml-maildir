I'd prefer it for 2.5 right now.  But if the cPCI stuff doesn't touch
anything else, I'd be interested in that for 2.4.
I don't want to really touch the core PCI code in 2.4 right now, unless
we _really_ have to :)

For 2.5, I'd love a patch to do that.  As I said above, I don't really
care about that for 2.4.
