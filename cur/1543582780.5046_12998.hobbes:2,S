Hi Heitzso,

ld is not complaining about a missing file.
The problem is with the version of ld you use. Some versions are using 
ld --oformat and other versions ld -oformat
This is quite a recent issue. So check the version of you linker.
You can solve the problem changing :
./arch/i386/boot/Makefile:      $(LD) -Ttext 0x0 -s -oformat binary -o $@ $<
to                                                  --oformat 
I think you hav not done any mistake, but the latest Debian (unstable) version
of ld seems not to be right.
I think this will works.
