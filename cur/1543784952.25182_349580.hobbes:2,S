Well, as long as we represent the u32 (or u64) as
scsilun[1] | (scsilun[0] << 8) | (scsilun[3] << 16) | (scsilun[2] << 24)
I think we cover all 2 level lun bases, don't we (obviously we ignore
levels 3 and 4 [and 6 and 8 byte extended luns])?
That representation works transparently for type 00b which is what SPI
and other legacy expects, since our lun variable is equal to the actual
numeric lun.  Although SAM allows type 01b for arrays with < 256 LUNs it
does strongly suggest you use type 00b which hopefully will cover us for
a while longer...
fc already uses int_to_scsilun and 8 byte LUN addressing, so it will
work even in the 01b case (the numbers that the mid-layer prints will
look odd, but at least the driver will work).
