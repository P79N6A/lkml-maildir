But doesn't this:
I-TLB userspace misses: 142369  I-TLB userspace misses: 2179    ITLB u: 139190
I-TLB kernel misses: 118288    	I-TLB kernel misses: 1369	ITLB k: 116319
D-TLB userspace misses: 222916 	D-TLB userspace misses: 180249	DTLB u: 38667
D-TLB kernel misses: 207773    	D-TLB kernel misses: 167236	DTLB k: 38273
mean that we're mainly missing on data accesses?

The workload you're using also does write(), and the write() paths got
significantly deeper.
Stack misses, perhaps.  But a tlb entry caches the translation for a single
page, yes?
