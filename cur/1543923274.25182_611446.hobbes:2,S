Subject: [PATCH 0/2] MN10300: Add the MN10300 architecture to Linux kernel [try #2]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/29/125

These patches add the MEI/Panasonic MN10300/AM33 architecture to the Linux
kernel.
The first patch makes it possible to suppress AOUT support in the ELF binfmt.
MN10300 does not support the AOUT binfmt, so the ELF binfmt should not be
permitted to go looking for AOUT libraries to load.
The second patch adds the architecture itself, to be selected by ARCH=mn10300
on the make command line.
The patches can also be downloaded from:
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/mn10300/mn10300-arch.tar.bz2
A suitable toolchain can be downloaded from:
	
ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/gnupro/AM33/
The latest is currently:
	am33-04r2-5/tools/i686-pc-linux-gnulibc2.3-x-am33_2.0-linux-gnu.tar.bz2
