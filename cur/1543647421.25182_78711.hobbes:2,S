IMHO this shoudln't be taken care of. As you say it, a linux box has no
free memory (or it's been very recently booted), so the problem is not
to make O_STREAMING pages "low priority", but just to make them not stay
in the cache (perhaps just keep a few KB worth of them in case of a
limited seek back, but not more).
