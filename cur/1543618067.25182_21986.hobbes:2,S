That crossed my mind too, however that's not what we've been doing in
the past and multi mode has worked fine.

You are saying that even when I do:
	/* this is our request */
	rq->nr_sectors = 48;
	rq->current_nr_sectors = 8;
	/* drive->mult_count has been programmed to 16 */
	/* bla bla command setup */
	OUT_BYTE(rq->current_nr_sectors, IDE_NSECTOR_REG);
	ide_set_hander(...);
	OUT_BYTE(WIN_MULTREAD, IDE_COMMAND_REG);
The drive will be wanting to transfer _16_ sectors, even though I told
it that I want _8_. This sounds very strange to me, and it means that
2.2/2.4 etc should have never worked in multi mode. I'll go find the
spec now... I am just talking out of my ass.

I will do so now, I think I've stated my speculation above and in
earlier mails :-)
