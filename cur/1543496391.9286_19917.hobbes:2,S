Subject: [admin] linux-kernel digest corruption
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I sent several messages about this to owner-linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu
in weeks past but haven't heard anything.
The linux-kernel digest has serious corruption problems; many times the
digest is either missing a middle section, or is truncated at the end.
It seems to be related to people posting patches and other MIME matierla
to the list, but that is just a guess.
