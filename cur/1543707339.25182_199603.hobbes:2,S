There's a simple enough reason: it can't be done securely.
The reason is, that the path lookup for the mountpoint is performed by
the mount syscall, so the permissions of the looked up inode can only
be checked in the mount syscall.

Yeah, it's been done (fusermount in FUSE), but it cannot be made truly
secure.

But you don't need a configuration framework for simple filesystem
operations like mkdir, etc.  IMHO mount should be one of those simple
operations, since it's a very powerful addition to the other
filesystem tools.
My feeling that it really can be done simply without a lot of
framework in kernel.  I know Al Viro had some ideas about this (see
the #ifdef in mount_is_safe() in fs/namespace.c), but he seems to be
onto other things now, and doesn't care about the VFS any more ;-(.
Thanks for your comments,
Miklos
