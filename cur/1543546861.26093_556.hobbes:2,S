So when a 'process' has tons'o'threads from the point-of-view of a
programmer, even though it is really tons'o'clone()s from the point of view
of an OS implementation, what *does* 'send the signal to the process' mean?
but yes, i agree that in trying to effectively support the
many-threads/process model, pthreads made it hard to support the
one-thread/process model for signal handling.
But since IMO, signal handling is brain dead to begin with, what were we to
do?

And one of the problems that motivated this discussion was the POSIX
requirement that a signal sent to a "multithreaded process" be sent to 
some thread that has enabled that signal or, if no thread is willing
to accept it, the signal must be  marked pending and then
delivered to the first thread that enables that signal.  When 
threads are processes it's a pain to implement this.
