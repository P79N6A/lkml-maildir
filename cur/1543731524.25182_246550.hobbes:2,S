640x480 = 307200 pixels
x 24 bits = 7372800 bits per frame (.9MB)
x 30 fps = 221184000
so that's 221mb/s for uncompressed 640x480. dv with 16bit pcm is 25Mb/s 
typically which is still a bit more than double what you can reasonably 
push through a usb1.1 port. raw you can push about 1.6 fp/s at 640x480 
through usb so your compression ratio needs to be order of 15 to 1 make 
it fit reasonably with room for overhead.
