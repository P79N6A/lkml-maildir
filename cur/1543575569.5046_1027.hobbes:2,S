Speaking about performance - could someone explain me why
md5checksumming on 10GB
partition is taking my whole 128MB memory and is permamently swaping out
every application off my memory to swap so the computer is very slow
during
this process???
Could I set somewhere in /proc that I do not wish to have 100MB disk
buffers ?
