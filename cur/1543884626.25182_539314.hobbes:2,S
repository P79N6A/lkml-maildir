Okay.

If you did have a process which polls for the service, what happens if
that process dies?

What if the dbus system dies?  What if your monitoring process dies?
Surely a simple solution is going to be the best solution?  Given that
you're always going to have another process (which might be killed)
your thought about having a parent process monitor the death of the
child seems to be the simplest.
You could also have that process interact with a watchog, so failures
with that process cause a reboot.
