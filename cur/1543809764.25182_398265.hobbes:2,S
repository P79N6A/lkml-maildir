Here my example does correct for this error, it accumulates the difference 
between the clock update and the desired ntp update and once it's large 
enough, it's corrected by a multiplier change.

I don't understand what the advantage would be, the NTP code needs both 
and the time interval is actually the variable part, so AFAICT it would 
make the NTP code only more complex. (NTP changes the amount of time to be 
passed per tick to adjust clock speed and not the other way around.)
