Subject: [PATCH] Race condition in del_timer_sync (2.5)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

 Hello,
 This patch fixes a race between del_timer_sync and recursive timers.
Current implementation allows the value of timer->base that is used
for timer_pending test to be fetched before finishing running_timer
test, so it's possible for a recursive time to be pending after
del_timer_sync.  Adding smp_rmb before timer_pending removes the race.
 The patch is against the latest 2.5 bk tree.  Please point out if I
got something wrong.  TIA.
