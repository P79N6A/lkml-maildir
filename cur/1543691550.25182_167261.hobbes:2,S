Really?  So where's the source to the BIOS of your machine?  Your drive
firmware?  Do you drive a car?  Turn on a microwave?  Use a cell phone?
And didn't you say:

So if you don't use closed source then why is it that those binaries are
giving you a problem?  Could it be that you don't practice what you 
preach?  Oh, I see, it's OK to use closed source if you need to play
quake but not if you want to check in some code.  Sure, I can see how
that makes sense.  NOT.
