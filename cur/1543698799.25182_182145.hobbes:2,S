I applied fixes similar to your suggestion to i2c-2.7.0
and lm_sensors-2.7.0 to get these to build, looks OK.
My final depmod has this problem though:
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in
/lib/modules/2.4.23aa1/kernel/drivers/video/sis/sisfb.o
depmod:         __floatsidf
depmod:         __divdf3
depmod:         __fixunsdfsi
depmod:         __muldf3
depmod:         __adddf3
I do not have this problem with 2.4.23, and I see the -aa1 patch
actually removing some FP ops. But therer are some left in other
sources (e.g. sis_main.c) so maybe some link problem was exposed?
Reverting the sis/init.c hunk does not fix this. Can it be related
to this in arch/i386/Makefile:
-CFLAGS += -pipe
+CFLAGS += -pipe -msoft-float
