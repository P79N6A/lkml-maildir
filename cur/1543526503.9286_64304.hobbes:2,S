Hehe.  Well, yes...  That is what I assumed - that it is
currently NOT possible.  It is something that SHOULD be possible
sometime in the future though.  There are systems out there, in
which for military reasons, or perhaps other top secret reasons
that files need to remain top secret and not visible to any
system admin person.  I'm thinking here of A or B class
security..  which is likely a long way off..  Oh well, it was
worth asking anyways..
Thanks for your reply,
