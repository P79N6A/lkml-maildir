Hi.  I've got a ST15150W 4.3G Seagate Barracuda in my system.  It's
fast/wide.  My SCSI card is an AMI MegaRAID 418 card.  According to a
util called scsiinfo, synchronous transfers are on, and it is
tranferring 16 bits (wide).   It's just replaced a Quantum Fireball,
UDMA/33 drive.  While things are slightly snappier when the system load
is high (like when X is coming up), on a regular basis things appear to
take much longer.  As an example, off hand:
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  6.15 seconds =10.41 MB/sec
/dev/sda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 13.64 seconds = 4.69 MB/sec
And another:
time tar -xzf /home/jrduchek/X335src-1.tgz
6.910u 4.760s 0:24.70 47.2%     0+0k 0+0io
4486pf+0w                         IDE
time tar -xzf /home/jrduchek/X335src-1.tgz
6.600u 3.910s 0:31.58 33.2%     0+0k 0+0io
4480pf+0w                         SCSI
The system is a K6-III 450, 192M of RAM, the SCSI card has 4M cache on
it.
Any ideas?  Who should I email about questions on the driver, I imagine
AMI themselves will tell me they don't officially support it.  Am I
missing something?
Thanks in advance.  PS the following is information that might be of
use.
