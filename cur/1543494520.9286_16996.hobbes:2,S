Fascinating. There's a deep dip in the dentry_cache - I wonder where all
that memory for that particular line has disappeared to. I would have
expected the other lines to show a corresponding dip going upwards. So I
would suspect a leak in the dentry_cache code in certain circumstances.
Also, the steadily gowing-upwards curves for the rest is disturbing. I
don't see any sign of memory being freed-up over time. There should be a
point where it stabilises and starts re-using buffers instead of grabbing
more and more memory as it requires.
Cheers,
Alex
