That all looks expected, I think. cdda2wav uses SG_IO so it utilizes
zero copy dma with an unpatched kernel already, my CDROMREADAUDIO dma
patch makes zero difference for that io path (it's already fully
optimized). WRT the difference in run time between cdparanoia w/patched
kernel and cdda2wav, it probably has to do with the various jitter
corrections and scratch resistance stuff that cdparanoia does. If you
disable some of those options, its runtime will probably get a lot
closer to that of cdda2wav.
