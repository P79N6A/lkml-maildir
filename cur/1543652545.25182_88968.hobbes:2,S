*Sigh*
Note that scsi_lib.c does not include linux/genhd.h, thus I missed
that. :-/

That may be a matter of style, but I would strongly prefer these to be
#define req_new_io(_a,_b,_c) do {} while(0)
#define req_merge_io(_a)     do {} while(0)
#define req_finished_io(_a)  do {} while(0)
instead ... anyway, please disregard my patch and add
#include <linux/genhd.h>
in scsi/scsi_lib.c.  :-/
