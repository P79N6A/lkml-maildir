The Debian installer did not have a choice: until very recently udev was
not quite up to the task and having all devices on a filesystem simply
takes too much space. So for the next Debian release the installer will
have to rely on devfs. But since it is based on 2.4 kernels anyway that
isn't a problem.
For the release after sarge d-i will probably have to switch to a 2.6
kernel with hotplug, but that is a long way off at the moment.
