Randomization on.  Executable runs with 8x blips/hits.
Randomization off.  Executable runs without blips/hits.
With randomization off, a mere rename causes an 8x-slowdown to occur.  Run 
this renamed executable through sh -c ./tstExec, and the slowdown 
disappears.  Really weired :)

see below.
Beware, this is highly compiler/glibc/distribution dependent.
My test environment is mdk9.1, gcc-3.2.2-3, 2.6.17.4, compile with -Os switch
Confirmed on rhel4, gcc-4.0.1, 2.6.9-5.EL, compile with no switches
Thanks!
