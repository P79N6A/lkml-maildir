Right on. LowFree drops and when it reaches almost nothing the system
more or less goes freezes. 
The DAC960 driver is not a SCSI driver so this means that there is
something wrong with the PCI-DMA transfers, right?
Replacing the DAC960 with another RAID-kontroller will not help because
it will use the same PCI-DMA transfers, right? Any hints on how I can
mend this?
