But it might turn out to be a reason for it turning into a geek trophy, if the 
price is not enormously higher than closed-spec cards.  You could for 
example, program real-time sound effects processing into the FPGA and output 
the samples through a standard sound card.
The enthusiast market is a big market these days.

I hope you're planning to have a divider available to the rasterizer for 
perspective interpolation, particularly of textures.
