Dave, after looking a bit at this it seems you could be "mostly" right
with this 2). Maybe I've missed something (I didn't verify this yet), but
it looks like +1 level (SINGLE_LEVEL_NESTING) could be needed in:
class_device_add() (as you did), but probably also class_device_del() and
class_device_destroy().
...But, there seems to be "little" problem, if there is used this recursion
with: class_intf->add()/remove() in class_device_add()/del()?! Then Kay
is right about possibility of deeper nesting. If this path is really used,
and any of these class_device_* functions with locking are called, then
this patch couldn't work like this. So, there is a question: how deep
nesting is currently used here?
