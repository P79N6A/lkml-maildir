I tested it on Solaris 2.7 . No time stamp change in any of these two
cases ->
mv tmp tmp1
mv tmp ..
In the 1st case there is no justification for time change bcos even the ..
link inside the dir has not changed. In the 2nd case, there may be some
justification but it will lead to a lot of confusion. When there is
nothing to gain and something to lose why make such a change from
traditional behavior ?
