There are no hard-sector boundaries in Linux. The geometry of a drive
is really ignored. It's just used to determine the size of a disk
partition, etc. The stated Heads/cylinders/sectors is a throw-back
to the old int 0x13, DOS days where stuff had to fit into registers
for access.
If your driver expects to write physical sectors, it's broken.
Even physical sectors (on the media) don't really exist anymore.
They are now "logical" sectors and they are never really accessed
as a single unit (except in floppies). They are "extracted" from a
sector-buffer that could contain nearly a whole track.
Cheers,
