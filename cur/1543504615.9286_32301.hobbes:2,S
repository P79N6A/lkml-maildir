Well, what I was trying to say was that if what I'm doing is going to
*force* someone to update something, I'd rather have them go ahead and
update to and start using the latest NASM rather than the latest binutils,
simply because I trust NASM and it's 16-bit code generation quite a bit
more than gas'. And not to mention that NASM was designed to be a full
featured but red-tapeless assembler, while on the other hand gas was
designed to be the backend of gcc. 
Hopefully that clears up my position a bit.
