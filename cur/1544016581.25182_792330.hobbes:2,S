By then it's too late.  There could already be many files with delayed
allocations beyond eof that are unneccesarily consuming space.  I suspect
that when those files are flushed some are not able to convert the full
delayed allocation in one extent and only convert what is needed to write
out data.  The remaining unused delayed allocation is released and that's
why the freespace is going up and down.
