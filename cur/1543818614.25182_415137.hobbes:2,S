Dear diary, on Mon, Apr 10, 2006 at 09:42:03AM CEST, I got a letter
where "Eric W. Biederman" <ebiederm@xmission.com> said that...

Oops, I completely forgot about fchdir(). Thanks, I think I will use
something like this for now.
By the way, I would like to return to a statement from your previous
mail:

I still don't understand this - so why don't provide them _this_ way to
get that information? What is the security risk?

Right now I am having amnesia and deja-vu at the same time.  I think
I have forgotten this before.
