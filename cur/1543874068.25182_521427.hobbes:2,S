Hello!
We've a very strange Problem with Kernel 2.6.20.x
If i try to access a SCSI or SATA Disk (tested with Adaptec U320 
ASC-29320, ICP Vortex 9024, Promise TX300) the whole server hangs - no 
output - no error on the screen - but it hangs completely. But it does 
not happen on all our systems affected are only old 604pin xeons and 
socket 940 Opterons. Socket F Opteron or 771 Xeons does work fine.
I've also testet apci=off pci=routeirq but both does not help. The 
systems work fine with 2.6.19.x and before.
Stefan
