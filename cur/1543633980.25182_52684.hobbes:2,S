Sure. But those are the things that are normally proposed to relieve the
situation. (And yes, I got the uuid thing confused.)
I actually forgot one. LVM. There, signatures are stored on the disks.

Oh, I expected to do it myself if it does not get bashed too much ...
THANKS!
And, yes, I agree, I would prefer to know it's accepted in 2.5 before it's
applied to 2.4. It's just that I develop on 2.4 currently :-(

I did not want to duplicate the information from /proc/scsi/scsi. The 
idea was that it should be straightforward to make device nodes from 
the information provided in map and to allow more elaborated code in
userspace to know where to collect information from.

That would be great! 
Because the mapping between sg and the other device is known, you can use
the sg device to do ioctls on it (or even send SCSI commands) or to use
the information from /proc/scsi/sg/ as well.
