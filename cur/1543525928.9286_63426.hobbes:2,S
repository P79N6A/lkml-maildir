Subject: [PATCH] (2.3.42) revised spinlock metering for ia32 & alpha
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I attach a revised version of the spinlock metering code that I
contributed last week.  This revision fixes some shortcomings that
others pointed out, i.e., reducing ia32 bus locking during spin_lock(),
and returning proper error codes and length when doing I/O to
/proc/lockmeter.  This version also supports lockmetering of Alpha
SMP kernels, as well as IA32, thanks to the contributions of Peter
Rival.
An updated "lockstat" command is also available from the website:
  
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/lockmeter/download
that is compatible with the corrected /proc/lockmeter return values.
Followon work is currently in-progress to implement various enhancements
that others have suggested.
