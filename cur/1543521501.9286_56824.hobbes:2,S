Hi guys,
Yesterday I found that using very slow (2400) console with NMI watchdog
enabled makes it impossible to boot. It is not a bug per se (and one can
just pass nmi_watchdog=0 boot option, but it may be impossible if your
command line is close to 79 bytes). Just thought I should let you know, in
case it is considered an annoyance. (I recovered by booting 2.2.x
kernel and then adjusted lilo.conf to pass console=ttyS0,38400 instead).
Regards,
