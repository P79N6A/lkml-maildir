FYI: The original "adaptive" name was chosen in the -rt implementation
to reflect that the locks can adaptively spin or sleep, depending on
conditions.  I realize this is in contrast to the typical usage of the
term when it is in reference to the spin-time being based on some
empirical heuristics, etc as you mentioned.  Sorry for the confusion.
