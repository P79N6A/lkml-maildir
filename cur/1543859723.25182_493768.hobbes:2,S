The problem is that if inode number collision happens occasionally, you 
get data corruption with cp -a command --- it will just copy one file and 
hardlink the other.

If user (or script) doesn't specify that flag, it doesn't help. I think 
the best solution for these filesystems would be either to add new syscall
 	int is_hardlink(char *filename1, char *filename2)
(but I know adding syscall bloat may be objectionable)
or add new field in statvfs ST_HAS_BROKEN_INO_T, that applications can 
test and disable hardlink processing.
