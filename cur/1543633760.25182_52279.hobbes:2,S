Hmmm...this seems broken to me.  Switching from tagged to untagged 
momentarily and then back is perfectly valid.  Can the bio layer 
handle this and not the scsi layer, or are both layers unable to handle 
this sort of tag manipulation?

If you are using the bio layer tag processing, then it should be 
doing this part I would think.  If it isn't, then it sounds like either 
it's design is missing some key elements required to be fully functional 
or the integration between the scsi layer and the bio layer needs some 
additional work.
