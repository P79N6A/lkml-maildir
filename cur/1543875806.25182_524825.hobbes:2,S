The issue comes from a corner case and the underlying problem is that e1000 
isn't stopping tx properly. We have a fix for this pending in our tree that I'll 
push upstream for 2.6.22 to Jeff, but I don't think this should be a blocker and 
it's probably is not a regression at all, the gap has always been present.
on a side note, this is probably fixed easily by turning the adapters 
detect_tx_hung flag off in e1000_down, so if someone spots this reoccurring 
somewhat regularly, please contact me so we can debug it. I myself have a system 
suspend/resuming in circles for an hour now with traffic flying across without a 
single hit on it....
Adrian, you probably want to drop this issue from your list.
Cheers,
Auke
