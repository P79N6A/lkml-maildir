Hi Chris,
I don't have much experience on implementing virtual filesystem, 
but I am willing to try it if that is the right interface for job. 
However, I am not sure how to map all current job ioctls to a 
nice and simple filesystem, at the same time I would like to keep 
the user library interface the same so our applications will not 
break.
Would you mind giving me some help on the job ioctls and fs
mapping? Thanks in advance!
