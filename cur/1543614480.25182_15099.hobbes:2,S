Hi,
did something similar before christmas. Had a small win installation in
a vmware, slsnif running on the linux host and connected vmware on a
ttyp slsnif gave me. easy.
BTW what card reader is it ? There are already enough _user space_
implementations for serial smartcard readers. This is where this
normally belongs to.
