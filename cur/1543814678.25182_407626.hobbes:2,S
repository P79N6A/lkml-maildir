Hello,
I've tried to modprobe -r iptable_nat on a debian testing system running
debian's 2.6.15-1-686 kernel. Now modprobe is taking 99% cpu resources
and can't be killed even with -9. I've tried to kill it's parents (ssh
---- bash --- modprobe) but that didn't help too.
I don't want to restart the machine as it is a production one and alot
of people count on it.
Exactly the same thing happened when the machine was in the "testlab"
(pre deployment) and i tried to rmmod ip_conntrack.
Is that some kind of kernel issue? Can i stop that process someway?
thanks in advance
