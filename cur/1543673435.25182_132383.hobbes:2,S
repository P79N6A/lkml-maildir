ok, I've now established that kernel version is irrelevant.
the server keeps on ticking, no problems.
the client (which runs fsx on an nfs mount) fails.
Two failure modes.
1, fsx dies with bus error. This is infrequent (seen it once)
   The most common failure mode is..
2, fsx fails. Different failure each time. Usually takes a minute
   to trigger.

Untested, I can give that a try.
