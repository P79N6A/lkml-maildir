You basically want to detect free fall. You don't need to make the machine
hit the concrete at the bottom; as long as it detects free fall, it is okay.
It does not seem *that* hard to me (but I do speech recognition at university :-).
Anyway, accelerometers are usefull for other stuff, too, like playing neverball.
Oh, and there should be reasonable way to develop this. First, detect
"machine sitting on unmoving table", and park heads if you detect anythink
else. Now, someone who really cares can develop model for "train", but most users are already quite well protected after you do "table" model.
