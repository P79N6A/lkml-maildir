	Thanks for the good work !
	For 2.4.X : 2.4.21-pre2 has WE-15, so if you get it it's only
one patch (the one on my page).
	For 2.5.X : my Pcmcia cards still don't work with 2.5.54, so
I'm currently no too worried about 2.5.X at the moment.
	Also, the current WE16-3 may not be the final version, as I'm
waiting for feedback from driver authors. Talking of feedback, which
part of WE16 do you need and why ?
	Have fun...
	Jean
