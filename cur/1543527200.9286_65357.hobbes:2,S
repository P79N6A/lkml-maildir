   A good idea seem to use the Pentium local APIC's programmable timer (I
   know Ingo is working on that).
   But unfortunately, the APIC seems to be disabled on most UP
   motherboards. Does someone knows MBs with the APIC enabled?
   Does somebody have programming experience with the APIC? Some docs?
   Any other suggestion are welcome.
It's not that the APIC is disabled on most UP motherboards; it's not
there at all.  APIC's are expensive, so on motherboards where it's not
necessary (since all OS's have to have 8259 PIC support anyway) most UP
chipsets only provide a PIC which 8259 compatible.  It's not that you
*can't* put an APIC on a UP machine, it's just that in practice most MB
manufacturer's don't, for cost reasons.
