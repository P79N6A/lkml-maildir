Hello.
Here is a patch (tested on kernels 2.4.3 and 2.4.4) that adds 2 ioctl's in serial.c. One, TCSSERCPR, sets the CPR register in 16C950 UARTs. This register is a pre-scaler (that is, a divisor) for the clock. If the value is N, the clock is divided by N/8. 
If N<8, pre-scaling is disabled by setting bit 7 of MCR to 0. The other one, TCGSERCPR,, reads the value of CPR. If pre-scaling is disabled, it returns 8 (i.e., the clock frequency is left intact).
The patch also disables resetting the UART via the CSR register every time the serial device is opened (in the startup() function). This would reset the content of CPR.
