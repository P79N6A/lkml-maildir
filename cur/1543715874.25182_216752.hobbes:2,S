Possibly - but the process which is in reclaim will throttle and will kick
pdflush which will do the writepages() thing.
It needs testing.

Well I'd be interested in discovering which workloads actually suffer
significantly from doing this.  If it's a significant problem then perhaps
we should resurrect the writearound-from-within-writepage thing.  It's
pretty simple to do, especially since we now have efficient ways of finding
neighbouring dirty pages.
