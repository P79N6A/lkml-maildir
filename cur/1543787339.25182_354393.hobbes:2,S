Sorry about the blank reply, hit send accidentally.
Probably, the EDID block is incomplete, so nvidiafb is refusing
custom modes.  You can change the #undef DEBUG to #define DEBUG
in drivers/video/fbmon.c to see verbose output of the EDID block in
dmesg.
Then, can you recompile without the DDC/I2C support, and boot with:
video=nvidiafb:1600x1200-60, then play with fbset later on.
If possible, you can also get the latest git snapshot then boot with:
video=nvidiafb:1600x1200MR
Note the appended MR - it's CVT with reduced blanking - which is
for LCD displays especially those manufactured by Dell since they
are the proponents of CVT.
