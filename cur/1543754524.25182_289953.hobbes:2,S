This seems reasonable enough to me.  Perhaps if there will be lots of timer
guts implementations, and more coming in modules or whatnot, then the union
should be replaced with a more generic private-data buffer, or at least
have a vanilla padding alternative in the union.  But I am certainly happy
with the simple path of just adding in the implementations as they come
like you've done for mmtimer.
Thanks,
Roland
