From your reaction above I gather that "LEAFN node level is 1 inode ..."
is a bad thing?
My filesystem (that crashes under heavy load, while rsyncing to and from
it) has a lot of these messages when xfs_repair is run.
Note that I've now put an older kernel on the system (2.6.15.6) and it
seems to be surviving longer than before, with 2.6.17.7. It would be
nice if it survived a day, as it's a backup server for a couple of
important things...
(See also my messages to the xfs list, subject "cache_purge: shake on
cache 0x5880a0 left 8 nodes!?" and "XFS internal error
XFS_WANT_CORRUPTED_GOTO".)
