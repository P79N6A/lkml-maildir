No.
The default allows a job to take ten times what is available,
and bad things happen later.
With overcommit mode 2 there is an upper bound, but you can
twiddle the bound as desired. From proc(5):
    /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
              This   file  contains  the  kernel  virtual  memory
              accounting mode. Values are:
              0: heuristic overcommit (this is the default)
              1: always overcommit, never check
              2: always check, never overcommit
              In mode 0, calls of mmap(2) with MAP_NORESERVE  set
              are  not  checked,  and  the  default check is very
              weak, leading to the  risk  of  getting  a  process
              "OOM-killed".   Under  Linux  2.4 any nonzero value
              implies mode 1.  In mode 2 (available  since  Linux
              2.6), the total virtual address space on the system
              is limited to (SS + RAM*(r/100)), where SS  is  the
              size  of the swap space, and RAM is the size of the
              physical memory, and r is the contents of the  file
              /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio.
       /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio
              See the description of /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_mem
So, what you have is a bound on virtual memory, and that bound
can very easily be larger than twice physical memory.
