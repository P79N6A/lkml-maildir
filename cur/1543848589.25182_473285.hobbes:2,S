Yes. linux/types.h is exported header and it defines all endian types.

They do not.  Trivial search in vanilla tree shows
                for (psm = 0x1001; psm < 0x1100; psm += 2)
                        if (!__l2cap_get_sock_by_addr(psm, src)) {
                                l2cap_pi(sk)->psm   = htobs(psm);
                                l2cap_pi(sk)->sport = htobs(psm);
                                err = 0;
                                break;
                        }
which is very definitely not putting a host-endian there.  You can
switch it to host-endian, of course, but then you have to modify
at least that place.

You are misreading it.  Old code flipped cmd->len in place in the caller.
New one doesn't.
