the latter. to send MIDI Clock or MIDI Timecode requires an interrupt
source that is not locked to jiffie-ish intervals or power-of-2
related intervals. For example, MTC requires sending 2 bytes roughly
every 0.8msec. Sending them every msec isn't good enough, in general.
my understanding of the HRT patch is that it allows the timer to be
reprogrammed to elapse with nanosecond resolution. i don't understand
why linus has been so reluctant to move linux in this direction, other
than it being hard to fit into the existing fixed interval timer
framework.
