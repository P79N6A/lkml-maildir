-mm includes
git+ssh://master.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/axboe/linux-2.6-block.git#for-akpm,
but it's up to Jens to choose what goes in there.
git-block has been dropped from -mm since 2.6.23-rc1-mm1 (I think) because
it has something in there which breaks sata on the Vaio.  Prior to that (in
2.6.22-rc-late) there was nothing in that tree.
