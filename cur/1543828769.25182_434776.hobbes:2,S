c) no matter how badly your variant of git might suck, on server you
can always do
	echo [commit-ID] > .git/refs/heads/for-linus-<date>
and ask him to pull that branch from that server (if your version of
git doesn't suck, git checkout -b for-linus-<date>; git checkout <your
previous branch> will do it).
Then move on with the life, using whatever you are using.  The question when
to remove that file... hell, run "trim the stuff more than month old"
from cron every month and forget about it.
