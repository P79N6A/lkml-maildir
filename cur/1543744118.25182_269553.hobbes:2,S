Ah, found it.  Was caused by a patch from Tejun Heo <tj@home-tj.org>
that went into the tree in my last round of driver core changes.
Tejun, the call to unlink() in the error path in kobject_add() does a
kobject_put().  Your patch added an extra kobject_put() which caused bad
things to happen when we failed.
Andrew, does the patch below fix the issue for you?  It fixed my test
case.
thanks,

 Also document the thing so no one tries to "fix" it again...
