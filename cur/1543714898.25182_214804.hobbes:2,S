    For primary partitions, it is possible. Don't know for extended
ones :??

    AFAIK, fdisk will do, except for rereading. Well, 'fdisk'
actually *do* a rereading, but only after altering the partition
table of the disk. 'sfdisk' can do it on demand, but if the disk is
busy the BKLRRPART ioctl will fail.
