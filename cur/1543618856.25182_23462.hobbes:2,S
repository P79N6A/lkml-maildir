I can second that.
Now that I'm running AMD Athlon's since August 1999 I found during 3D 
development/benchmarking (OpenGL/Mesa) that the following GCC flags are 
"best" for Athlon/Duron with gcc-2.95.3:
-O -mcpu=k6 -pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -malign-functions=4 
-fschedule-insns2 -fexpensive-optimizations
I even compile the whole kernel with a little different flags setting. It is 
smaller and "faster" with them.
HOSTCFLAGS      = -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O -fomit-frame-pointer -mcpu=k6 
-pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -malign-functions=4 -fschedule-insns2 
-fexpensive-optimizations
CFLAGS := $(CPPFLAGS) -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O \
          -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common
linux/arch/i386/Makefile:
ifdef CONFIG_MK7
CFLAGS += $(shell if $(CC) -march=athlon -S -o /dev/null -xc /dev/null 
>/dev/null 2>&1; then echo "-march=athlon"; else echo "-mcpu=k6 -pipe 
-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -malign-functions=4 -fschedule-insns2 
-fexpensive-optimizations"; fi)
endif
