That was all screwed up.  Better version:
From: Andrew Morton <akpm@linux-foundation.org>
Ulrich says that we never used these clone flags and that nothing should be
using them.
As we're down to only a single bit left in clone's flags argument, let's add a
warning to check that no userspace is actually using these.  Hopefully we will
be able to recycle them.
Roland said:
  CLONE_STOPPED was previously used by some NTPL versions when under
  thread_db (i.e.  only when being actively debugged by gdb), but not for a
  long time now, and it never worked reliably when it was used.  Removing it
  seems fine to me.
