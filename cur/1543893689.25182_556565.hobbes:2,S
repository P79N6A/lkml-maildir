Yes, you missed the note that said:
	Note, I have not rebased git-md-accel yet.  While that is
happening I

It's either this or have an inconsistent coding style throughout
raid5.c.  I figure it is worth it to have reduced code duplication
between raid5 and raid6, and it makes it easier to add new cache
features going forward.  I have a few more cleanups to add for a rev2 of
this patch, but I will hold that off until the rebase is done.
