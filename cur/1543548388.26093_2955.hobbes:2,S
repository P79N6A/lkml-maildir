Thanks, that was helpful.  Comparison numbers for a null update of the 2.3
kernel, which means you update and then update again, timing the second update
to get some idea of the system's best case throughput, are:
    CVS: 139.5 seconds
    BK:    1.6 seconds
The BK tree is the 2.3 kernel tree maintained by FSMlabs.
