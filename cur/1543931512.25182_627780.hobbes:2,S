Ah ok, so that's a NUMA issue due to how the quicklists are implemented,
I see. Note that the flush isn't necessary a solution on all platforms.
On powerpc, I -still- need to defer with RCU as we don't do anything in
flush tlb. Our TLB invalidations are HW broadcast in the first place,
but what we need to sync with is the SW hash reload code.
So your solution in the quicklists doesn't solve the problem for us.
