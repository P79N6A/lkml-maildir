Subject: "Forced" two patches on one kernel - Make errors

I just patched my 2.4.13 kernel for mosix and xfs, which wasn't really easy, i got rejects and merged some stuff by hand. Now I am getting an error doing "make bzImage" - I do not understand this error. Could anybody please give me a pointer on where the problem might lie and what it probably looks like?
What i get is:
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `/usr/src/linux-2.4.13/vmlinux', needed by `compressed/bvmlinux'.  Stop.
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-2.4.13/arch/i386/boot'
make: *** [bzImage] Error 2
I have checked the Makefile in the /usr/src/linux dir, and it does have a "vmlinux:" entry.
So where should I search the problem?
Thanks in advance,
Fabian Svara
