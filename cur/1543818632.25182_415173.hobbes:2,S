IIRC, Xen does some kind of repetitive sync of
memory pages to allow the 'original' to continue
running for as long as possible, so pages and
structures get resynced until it looks like the
migration would require only a few pages to be
synced for the final move, then it does the actual
move ...

I think that zero downtime is some kind of marketing
buzzword here, and has nothing to do with the actual
time the migration takes, which will probably be
around 20 seconds or so (for larger guests) ...
