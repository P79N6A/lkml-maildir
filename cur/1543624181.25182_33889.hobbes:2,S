   Primary purpose of this patch is to make KERN_WARNING and
   KERN_INFO log levels closer to their original meaning.
   Today they are quite far from what was intended.
   Just look what kernel writes at the WARNING level
   each time you boot your box!
Maybe it is even better idea to change default kernel printk
logging level which is used when no KERN_* is specified, eh?
