As you can see, I screwed up on the title, so I may have confused
you...
...but I do agree with your comment. The patch I meant to refer to
(see revised title) does not appear in the 2.5.x tree either.
Have we BTW been shown any numbers that support the alleged benefits?
I may have missed those...
Cheers,
