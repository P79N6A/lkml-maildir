This is actually really important --- writepage on its own cannot
distinguish between requests to flush something to disk (eg. msync or
fsync), and requests to evict dirty data from memory.
This is really important for ext3's data journaling mode --- syncing
to disk only requires flushing as far as the journal, but evicting
dirty pages requires a full writeback too.  That's one place where our
traditional VM notion of writepage just isn't quite fine-grained
enough.
Cheers,
 Stephen
