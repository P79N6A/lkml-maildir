I mostly agree and generally like to use info manuals.
But there are times when info is the right answer and there are times where man
is the right answer.  texinfo manuals should be arranged in such a way that I
can quickly get at the information I need, just like with man.  Basically,
info and texinfo pages should be arranged so that I can replace
	man 2 open                      man 3 fclose
with
	info syscall open               info libc fclose
or something similar.  Also I want to be able to say
	info cp                         info XtUnmanageChild
and get to a concise description of the options available for `cp' and to a
concise description of `XtUnmanageChild'.  TeXinfo has some neat features
("global" search, hyperlinks, indexes) but needs a little bit more before it
can really replace `man'.  The index should already provide most of what's
needed, but a bit more work is warranted.  Especially for the `man -k'
equivalent.  Finally the `info/dir' file is a pain in the ass and should really
be automatically built (and be mostly unneeded) just like the man/whatis file.
