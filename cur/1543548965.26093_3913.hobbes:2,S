Ahh, now we're having fun.  It just so happens that I can speak to all
of these topics; not only have I seen the shows mentioned, but I have
a shop out the back which has both a pile of power tools and a pile of
antique tools (oldest one that I know of was made around 1837, a great
big spokeshave).  I use all of them regularly, no collector-foo here,
thank you.  I tend to retreat to working with hand tools when all this
geek stuff gets to be a bit much.
Cabinet making craftsmanship absolutely comes from a firm knowledge of
hand tools.  I'll bet you anything you want that the guy who sells that
$3K furniture knows exactly what a Norris is and has used one.  Probably
still does (OK, mebbe it's a Lie-Nielsen these days).
I've also used a number of kernel debuggers - kadb back at Sun, a monitor
back at ETA (amazingly similar in spirit to RT/Linux), SGI's monstrosity,
and probably others.
That said, who gives a hoot what I have or what I have used?  The question
is: does Linus have a point or not?  And the answer is, you bet he does.
Linus is saying that if you need a debugger then you don't know the code.
And if you don't know the code, then you shouldn't be hacking the code.
A debugger does little besides cover up a lack of knowledge.
It's not an easy to take point of view because by definition, most
people don't really know the code so most people want a debugger.
Linus would just as soon that you learn the code well enough that a
debugger becomes pointless.
I'm sort of in the middle.  I know BitKeeper very well, and it's actually
a larger wad of code than the kernel if you toss out the device drivers.
About the only thing I ever want a debugger for is a stacktrace back.  If
you give me that, I usually don't need anything else; and in general, you
shouldn't either.  You should *know* why you got to a particular place,
if you don't know that then how can you fix the bug?
So I'm gonna side with Linus on this one, if you make it hard now, it will
be easier later.  It also increases the quality of the people submitting
patches, which is a good thing.
