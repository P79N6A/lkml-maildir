You may tweak /proc/sys/vm/bdflush
to have it collect data for a long time before it is written to disk. This
incurs some risk though: Your memory will get less and less, because more
and more is occupied byt dirty buffers. At a certain percentage (first
bdflush param), it will start to write to disk ...
