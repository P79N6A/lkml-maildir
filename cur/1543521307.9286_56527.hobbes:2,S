That means you have to write a mini boot loader which knows how to do that
for each architecture (initrd-tftp is architecture independant), and 
you're subject to whatever arbitrary limits in image size the firmware
might have. It also means having to rebuild the kernel image file whenever
you make a modification to the contents of the initrd. It's also needs
more memory because you have to load the initrd into the initrd space at
boot and then decompress/copy it into the ramdisk, rather than loading it
directly into the ramdisk (which would matter if you had a 6MB RAM disk on
an 8MB machine or something like a lot of embedded systems).
