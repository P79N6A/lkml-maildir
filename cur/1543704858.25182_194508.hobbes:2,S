The ACPI tables report totally bogus CPU frequencies -- 1 and 0 MHz. I'm
surprised this differs between 2.6.0 and 2.6.x-mm... Len, any idea?

CPUfreq and the CPUfreq timing code _need_ to rely on the CPU frequencies
being reported by the drivers. If they're wrong all timing will be wrong[1]...
Nonetheless, a fix for the acpi driver which aborts on such "zero" MHz
reports has already been sent to Len for reviewal [2].

Agreed, will fix it.
