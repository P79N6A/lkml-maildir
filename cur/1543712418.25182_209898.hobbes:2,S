    That's right, but LP console must be activated at boot time (or
at module-loading time) AFAIK, so this is not the problem.

    This printer (Lexmark Optra E312) is not a winprinter, and the
problem is not related to commands. The printer works fine, I have no
problems with that. My problem arises when the printer is offline:
when I send data to the printer and it is not connected, the command
used to send that data doesn't fail, just waits forever...
    Thanks for your answer anyway :) Really I'm not familiar with the
parallel port :(
