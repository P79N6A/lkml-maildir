Being IO-related is believable based on what I've seen.  In the fault
condition, the system clock averages 5 seconds behind the CMOS clock
immediately after the system has booted (which requires a large amount of
IO).  If the system sits idle not doing anything the drift is almost
non-existant.  Jackd is really good at slowing the system clock down though,
but then again jackd is doing a lot of IO.
All this seems to confirm earlier idea that there are two issues: a slowdown
in the c3tsc timer, and something in RT which causes the selection of the
c3tsc timer ahead of the acpi_pm timer.
