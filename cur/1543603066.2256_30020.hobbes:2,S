	OK, first of all, it's _not_ an acorn partition table at all.
It's a garden-variety DOS partition table.
	Actually, you've found a rather nasty bug in acorn.c - code in
the current tree fails if it tries to look for acorn-style partition
table on a large-sector disk.  Fails with IO error, and reports that
to high-level code in check_partitions().  Which decides to stop.
msdos_partition() would be called after acorn_partition(), so it
doesn't get called at all.
	Lovely...  OK, there are two possible fixes - one is to
add check for block size into acorn_partition() (it's checked on
almost all branches, but there's one where it's missing).  Another
is to switch to new partition code, which works with any physical
sector size.
	I'm putting the new patch on anonftp -
ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/partition-c-S11-pre1
	News:
* massaged into form that should be easy to backport.
* acorn.c converted (_completely_ untested)
	Folks, please help to test that sucker.
