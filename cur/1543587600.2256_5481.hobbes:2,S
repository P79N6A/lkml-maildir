Wouldn't it make sense to define these in real world units?
And to use that to determine requested accuracy...
Those who wait for seconds will probably not have a problem with up to (half) 
a second longer wait - or...?
Those in range of the current jiffie should be able to handle up to one 
jiffie longer...
Requesting a wait in ms gives yo ms accuracy...
