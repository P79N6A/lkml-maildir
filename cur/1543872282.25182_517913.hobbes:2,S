No indeed it does not sound right at all to me either. Last time I encountered 
something like this we traced it and hit sched_yield calls somewhere in the 
graphic pipeline. So first question is, how does mainline perform with the 
same testcase, and second question is umm whatever it is that is slow is 
there a way to trace it to see if it yields?

Ah I also wonder if it hasn't broken with NO_HZ. I haven't had a chance to 
even confirm that the code works properly with it, I was only assuming (after 
our last chat). See if turning that off makes a difference?
Thanks for testing!
