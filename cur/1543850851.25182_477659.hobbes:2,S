It cannot have been intentional as there was no mention of the change to the
userspace interface in the git changelog (and the interface version number
was not changed).
A new patch is needed to revert the part of the patch that changed the
userspace interface.
Please don't forget to copy in the appropriate maintainers when you send
messages like this one:

so they can provide acks:-)
