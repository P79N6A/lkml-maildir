There is no way to implement them without credentials' cache. Which needs
to be done for many other reasons, but that's a separate patch and
separate story. If it's done - no serious penalty involved. However,
I doubt that we want a union on / itself. /dev - sure, /bin and /lib -
maybe, but /... What for?

What's the point in unmounting it? Let the root of the mount tree be fixed -
it actually simplifies the things big way. Not that we had any performance
penalty for having the thing in place - after this forced chroot we never
touch it in lookups. BTW, pivot_root() is simpler that way.
BTW, we probably want to add mount --move <old> <new> - atomically moving
a subtree from one place to another. Code is there, we just need to
decide on API. Andries?

Tomorrow I'll try to catch Erik and talk with him about that. I'm not sure
that I know anyone in Debian Install System Team (oh, boy... somebody sure
loved capital letters). And I've absolutely no idea who is doing that stuff
in other distributions...
