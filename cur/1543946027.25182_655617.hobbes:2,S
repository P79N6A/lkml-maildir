1) you are accessing dev->link_mode and tb[] outside the dev_base_lock 
2) there is obvious and immediate deadlock -- you acquire the 
   dev_base_lock twice, without any unlock, just look at the chunk above
3) even with this deadlock fixed, Rafael states that either NM or 
   wpa_supplicant (I don't recall from top of my head) still don't work
