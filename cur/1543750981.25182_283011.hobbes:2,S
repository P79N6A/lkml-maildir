I'm planning on doing some work with Ingo's realtime preemption patch
on a PowerPC platform.  I did some preliminary investigation of the
patch before Christmas, and am ready to do some serious work in the
next few weeks.
Has anyone else worked on this patch on PPC?  Is anyone else interested
in working with me on it?
Thanks,
 -- Tim
