Russell,
I have the same problem. This file is 920 lines long and contains
7 distinct changes according to the (well written) notes.
Akinobu,
I appreciate your work - but could this particular peice be
split up into 7 chunks?
That would make checking the behavior of something like
HAVE_ARCH_FFZ_BITOPS easier for each arch.
thanks,
grant
