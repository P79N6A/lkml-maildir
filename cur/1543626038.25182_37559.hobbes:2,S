Hello,
 I have no idea whom to send/ask this.
[1.] 
mixer can be accessed only by /dev/mixer, /dev/mixer1 does not
work.
[2.] 
There are two sound cards, first accessible as /dev/dsp, second as
/dev/dsp1. Mixer for first is /dev/mixer, for second should be
/dev/mixer1.. but it doesen't work.
eyck@ghost:~$ aumix -d /dev/mixer1 -r100
aumix:  MIXER_WRITE
eyck@ghost:~$ aumix -d /dev/mixer1 -w100
aumix:  MIXER_WRITE
 At first i thought it's a problem with gus driver, which i've been told
created some problems... but then I switched cards.. now gus is /dev/dsp
and sb is /dev/dsp1. And now I can control my gus, but no longer can
control sb.
[3.] Keywords: sound mixer
[4.] Kernel version: 2.4.18-xfs
[7.] ...irrelevant, probably.
[X.] 
 Who is current SOUND maintainer? Maybe I should switch to ALSA and stop
 bugging ppl?
best regards,

Eyck, 
 I'm back! And I'm BAD!
...Obviously within certain sensible preset parameters
