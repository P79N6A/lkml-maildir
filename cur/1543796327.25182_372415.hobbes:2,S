It's basically safe whenever you can schedule, and you are running on
behalf of a user task (as appose to a kernel thread).

Sure, they don't need to be used if you don't need to get data to or
from user context.

What is this code and what is it doing?

If they are grabbing data from user context into kernel (or vise versa)
that could easily cause an oops.  Not to mention it is a security risk.
