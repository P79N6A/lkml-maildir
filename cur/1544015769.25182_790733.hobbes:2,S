I do much of my testing on GM965, so you should be able to get it to work with 
the latest bits:
  - libdrm from git master of mesa/drm
  - mesa from git master of mesa/mesa
  - xf86-video-intel from git master
  - drm-intel-next from anholt's kernel tree
    (git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/anholt/drm-intel)
You'll need to use UXA as your AccelMethod.  If you run into issues with the 
above, please file bugs (if you don't already see your issue filed) at 
bugs.freedesktop.org.
Thanks,
