Here is example:
schedule_work();
keventd->cbus_process(), which has 2 variants:
1. process all pending events.
2. process only number of them.
In the first case we will hurt very noticeble insert performance,
because actual delivery takes some time, so one process will
take time_for_one_delivery * number_of_events_to_be_delivered, 
since in a peak number_of_events_to_be_delivered may be very high,
it will take too much time to flush the event queue and deliver all 
messages.
In the second case we finish our work in predictible time, 
but it can not help us with the keventd, which may [and is] cought
new schedule_work(), and thus will run cbus_process() again
without time window after previous delivering.
That time window is _very_ helpfull for the insert performance
and thus low latencies.

There is a queue of single event messages, if we process them all in one
shot, 
then there is no time to insert new event [each CPU is running keventd
thread]
untill all previous are sent.
So we split that queue into pieces of [currently] 10 messages in each, 
and send only them, then we sleep for some time, in which new inserts 
can be completed, then process next 10...

Sending is slow [in comparison to insertion], so it can be deferred 
for better latency.
Context switch and actuall sending will happen after main function(like
fork(), 
or any other in fast path) is already finished, so we do not hurt it's
performance.

If one needs low latency events in peaks - use CBUS, it will smooth 
shapes, since actual delivering will be postponed.
There is no _aggregate_ gain - only immediate low latenciy with work
deferring.

Yes, but if we care about low latencies, so we MUST defer work, even
if later it will cost additional context switch.

Andrew, CBUS is not intended to be faster than connector itself, 
it is just not possible, since it calls connector's methods
with some preparation, which takes time.
CBUS was designed to provide very fast _insert_ operation.
It is needed not only for fork() accounting, but for any
fast path, when we do not want to slow process down just to
send notification about it, instead we can create such a notification,
and deliver it later.
Why do we defer all work from HW IRQ into BH context?
Because while we are in HW IRQ we can not perform other tasks,
so with connector and CBUS we have the same situation.
While we are sending a low priority event, we stops actuall work,
which is not acceptible in many situations.

The main idea is not to speed up message delivering, 
but to not hurt existing fast pathes, when we insert some
notification delivering into it.

Yes, it is known issue, I introduced queue length in the CBUS for that too,
I think when it exceeds some threshold, CBUS will just directly call
cn_netlink_send(), and thus remove possible DOS.
Or do you have other ideas?

But there will be several works, one will sleep, 
but others will work without time window.
time [msec]          work
0                    schedule_delayed_work(w1, 10);
0                    schedule_delayed_work(w2, 10);
0                    schedule_delayed_work(w3, 10);
0                    schedule_delayed_work(w4, 10);
0                    schedule_delayed_work(w5, 10);
0                    schedule_delayed_work(w6, 10);
...
10                   cbus_process();
10+time*1                   cbus_process();
10+time*2                   cbus_process();
10+time*3                   cbus_process();
10+time*4                   cbus_process();
10+time*5                   cbus_process();
There will be no sleep between cbus_process() and next call, 
so there will not be any timewindow for others.
Or do you mean call schedule_delayed_process() only from cbus_process()?
It can be a case, but it will not allow convenient manipulation,
like removing CBUS - it will require flushing all keventd works
just to one cbus_process() call.
And it was prooven that having only one sending thread hurts 
performance smaller.
I tested it with SMP kernel on 1-way and 2-way systems.
