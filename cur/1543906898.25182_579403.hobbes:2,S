Something like that. They use it to fire the virtual timer (RTC in
the guest), otherwise there is no way to simulate a HZ=1000 guest
(esp. Freebsd 6.0) in a HZ=100 host without busy-waiting.
For mplayer it is not that important (I'd even ask "what for?" since
other players do not need it either by default).
