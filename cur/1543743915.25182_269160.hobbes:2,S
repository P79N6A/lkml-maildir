Hi guys,
What do you think about following set of patches. It adds drvctl default
device attribute (write only) that controls device/driver binding. It
expects commands in form of "CMD [DRIVER_NAME] [ARG ARG...]" so I think
it will be very easy to adapt it to Tejun's per-device parameters.
I adjusted serio bus to the new form of commands so now it accepts:
"detach", "attach <driver>", "rescan", "reconnect"
And I added PCI bus drvctl that understands "detach", "attach <driver>",
and "rescan".
As we add drvctl methods to the rest of the buses we can review what
can be pulled into the core and what has to stay bus-specific.
Plus there is the bind_mode patch that allows switching between automatic
and manual binding on per-device/per-driver base.
