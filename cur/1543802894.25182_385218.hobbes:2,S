Actually, anything with an ioctl interface is probably a good cantidate
for a writable sysfs file.  The basic idea is that we prefer something
in sysfs with a discrete, unique name.  It also makes it a lot easier to
develop with because you can look at the values from scripts, and you
don't have to worry about synchronizing any headers.
So, what kind of ioctls are we talking about?

There really isn't much "baggage" that a static file carries around.
All you have to do is omit filling in a function pointer.  Hotplug
events are one of those "for free" things that you get.

drivers/base/memory.c has a couple of little things.  A writable probe
file, and a somewhat miscellaneous file for representing the units that
are being dealt with.  Might be a place to start.  I can certainly
answer questions about it.  I would also suggest just doing a "find" or
"tree" on a few of your systems and looking for people that do similar
things to what you want.
I know I struggled to get the memory hotplug sysfs code to work at
first, but the code has been very, very low maintenance.
