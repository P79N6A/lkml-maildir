OK, first of all, I was wrong about it being an 8250 UART, I checked, and it is infact a 16540, not that it should make much difference, anyway :-)

OK, here goes, I used RZ on the command line instead of Minicom on the laptop, to maximize available memory.

Using 2.2.21 on the 486 laptop:
Laptop, (just booted):
0: uart:16450 port:3F8 irq:4 tx:0 rx:0 CTS|DTR|DSR
Desktop: 
1: uart:16550A port:000002F8 irq:3 tx:946840 rx:5516126 RTS|CTS|DTR|DSR
Now transfer a 64K file using Z-modem.
Laptop:
0: uart:16450 port:3F8 irq:4 baud:9600 tx:104 rx:66050 CTS|DSR
Desktop:
1: uart:16550A port:000002F8 irq:3 tx:1012890 rx:5516209 RTS|DTR

Using 2.5.40 on the laptop:
Laptop, (just booted):
0: uart:16450 port:000003F8 irq:4 tx:0 rx:0 CTS|DSR
Desktop: 
1: uart:16550A port:000002F8 irq:3 tx:1012890 rx:5516209 RTS|DTR
Now transfer a 64K file using Z-modem.
Contrary to what I originally thought, it did drop characters during disk access, but then it seemed to continue, only to drop characters again a second later.
Laptop:
0: uart:16450 port:000003F8 irq:4 tx:230 rx:73291 oe:45 CTS|DSR
Desktop:

I am begining to wonder whether it is something straightforward, like the newer kernel being more bloated, and therefore not being cached so well, causing the machine to run generally slower.
I remember seeing dropped characters with a bloated 2.2.13 kernel on that machine.
However, when I upgraded the other laptop from 2.2.x to 2.4.x, I saw an improvement in serial port performance, from an average of ~650 cps to ~950 cps.  Although I also upgraded glibc at the same time.  Seems like there are a lot of variables, sorry about that!  :-)
Hope the above info is helpful.  If you need me to do any more tests, or some with the other machine, let me know.
Cheers,
John.
