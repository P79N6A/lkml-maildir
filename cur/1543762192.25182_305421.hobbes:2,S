The choice is either barrier or volatile usually.  volatile is nasty
primarily because it causes compiler pessimism in variable reloading.

I know that's what I'm asking if an audit has been conducted for...to
replace the volatile, accesses have to be barrier protected.

Yes, that's a valid assumption ... and by the single threaded nature of
the error handler, always true.  However, the proposed patch wanted to
add a spinlock around the access in the scsi eh thread (the comment
stating for clarity).  Thus, the same change should be made in SATA for
consistency.
Since that change isn't in the patch, I was asking if all the users of
these variables had been audited for barriers instead ... since the
answer looks to be "no" to me.
