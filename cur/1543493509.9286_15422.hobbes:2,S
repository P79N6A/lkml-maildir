Having worked with many drivers in many kinds of Multitasking systems,
I thought Linux performance was rather __good__ . I note that for years,
Sun would't let you set the baud-rate higher than 19200, and VAXen
wouldn't allow greater than 9600. Now, VAXen are dead, most other
modern systems use UARTs with FIFOs, so the baud-rates can be very
high, regardless of some limit imposed by the rate at which interrupts
can be handled on these systems.
In Linux, the kernel does some considerable work before the driver's
ISR is called. This is good. It provides a nice standardized interface
to the ISR with a pointer to the drivers previously-registered stuff, etc.
If the driver's ISR was RAW, i.e., save your own registers, manipulate
the controller(s) yourself, set up your own data, etc., you could probably
run faster. However, usually to do useful work, this stuff has to be done
and I'd much rather have the kernel do it in a controlled standardized way
as it does.
As I said before, none of my tests and measurments were complaints, only
statements of verifiable facts.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
