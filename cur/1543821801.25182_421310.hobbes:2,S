I have specified the actual
resolution. Text mode with vesafb fills the whole screen (and the on-screen
menu says 1024x768 which is the native resolution of the monitor). The screenshot
I took when using X via fbdev (set to 1024x768 too) while the displaying was
erroneous is 1024x768 as well. It somehow just doesn't reach the monitor in
that form.
