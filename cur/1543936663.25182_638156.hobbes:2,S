Yes, that is kinda wrong.  Its a difficult one to deal with nicely as
basically spacing goes to hell when comments are wedged in the middle.
The rules basically go out the window.  In the next version I do at
least have a handle on where comments are, but we have not yet
progressed to where we can simply get the spacing checks right.
I'll think more on it, and see what we can do.
