I noticed some problems in your patch.
  - unmap_hugepage_range() may over-decrease mm->rss, since
    some pte's may not assigned pages yet.
  - Some architectures may require to call update_mmu_cache() right after
    a pte is updated.
The following patch will fix them on IA32.
Patches against other architectures should be also needed.
Thanks,
Hirokazu Takahashi.
