Actually I think this is *the* idea. Why not simply set up a
bittorrent tracker and have a distributed kernel.org
fileserving system? Instead of having links to http and ftp
sites there could be a torrent link as well. Several
OpenSource projects started distributing files with BT
already and it seems to work like a charm.
