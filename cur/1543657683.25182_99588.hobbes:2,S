Hes trolling... these sorts of things are such a muddy mess in the US that
it's a coin toss whether any lawsuit will win.
He should stop talking about it and just do it and in the meantime
us would be better off just black holing his email.  I doubt hes going to
go through with it and I question how much money someone who has to get
his internet access off a TV settop box really has enough money to pay for
the planned lawsuit anyhow.
Can we all stop feeding the trolls now?
