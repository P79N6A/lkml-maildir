As someone who *has* been bitten by this bug - by all means.
I'd like to emphasize one more point - we were able to debug it only because 
old kernel at least displayed debug messages. Current kernel deadlocks 
absolutely dead (pun intended). No output to console, no indication what 
happens. I consider this regression. If at all possible, we should make sure 
that console output is available as early as possible.
