There seems to be a bug in the mail routing again. It may be related to the
recent problem with ditto copier history outbreaks on Linux S/390 and the
infamous 'pdp-11 memory subsystem' article routing bug that plagued 
comp.os.minix once.
In the meantime can people check that their mailer hasnt spontaneously added
linux-kernel to their history articles before posting them ?
