Lads,
I've had a discussion with Matthew Dharm
<mdharm-usb@one-eyed-alien.net> on the Linux-usb mailing list
<linux-usb-users@lists.sourceforge.net> and I'm taking the topic
here...

Here's the problem:
 The iRiver H100 series MP3 players work with linux, but quite
 unreliably. By unreliable, I mean that repetitively md5sum'ing the
 files on the device yield different results:
   find <mountpoint> -type f -print0 | sort -z | xargs -r0 md5sum > sums.1
   find <mountpoint> -type f -print0 | sort -z | xargs -r0 md5sum > sums.2
   diff sums.1 sums.2
 will dump a bunch of diffs. Bad, bad, bad...
With vanilla 2.4.26, these kernel messages are issued and an I/O error
is returned to user space:
  USB Mass Storage device found at 18
  SCSI disk error : host 1 channel 0 id 0 lun 0 return code = 8000000
  Current sd08:21: sense key None
   I/O error: dev 08:21, sector 2225382
The sector numbers change all the time... Retrying a faulty sector
will give a good result.
After recompiling with debug message, here are the messages before and
during the error (2.4.26 too):

When using vanilla 2.6.5, I get no I/O errors, but the md5 diffs are
still generated, so there is still something wrong...
Apparently, the problem is that the device posts an empty reply to a
valid query (save an bug in linux, which I could not pinpoint (yet?)).
I have tried running the device on different computers with different
USB chipsets, and I could reproduce the problem every time.
I am posting here to see if anyone can provide any debugging help or
other clues before I call it quit.
Thanks,
Phil.
