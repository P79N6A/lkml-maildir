I discussed it with other maintainers and knew that current kprobes
does not allow user to insert a kprobe to another kprobe's instruction
buffer, because register_kprobe ensures the insertion address is text.
Now I changed my mind. I think that case (p && kprobe_running() &&
kcb->kprobe_status==KPROBE_HIT_SS) is BUG(), even if (*p->ainsn.insn ==
BREAKPOINT_INSTRUCTION).

I also changed my mind. In this case, the kernel debugger can retrieve
correct breakpoint address by using kprobe_running() as below.
---
kp = kprobe_running();
if (kp)
	addr = kp->addr;
else
	addr = regs->ip;
---
The last discussion point is that we should restore flags or not if
(!p && kprobe_running() && kcb->kprobe_status==KPROBE_HIT_SS).
I think we do not need to do that if the debugger premises that
kprobes exists.
Thank you,
