I just didn't notice the time drift during normal conditions, but it 
gets REALLY bad when I suspend my laptop.
As a reference, I suspended it aproximately at 01:00 and resumed it at 
15:25 but the clock says 22:30. It does not occur in 2.6.9. Dmesg output 
relative to time dmesg|grep time:
$ dmesg|grep time
