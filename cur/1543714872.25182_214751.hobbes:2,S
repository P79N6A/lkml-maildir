It seems that pci config space is messed up after resume for Intel
ICH4 audio controller (on Dell Latitude D600, but I notice that others
also complain about this problem). Consequently resume from S3 causes
oops with snd_intel8x0 module. If the module is removed before suspend
and loaded afterwards, I still get oops. The following simple patch
fixes the problem. With this, I can leave alsa untouched during
suspend/resume.
