Which just goes to show what a fragile firmware design it is, to have
firmware callbacks doing device I/O.  I think the whole approach of
having firmware callbacks is fundamentally flawed but I'll do my best
to keep it working, for those things that care.  If it works over 50%
of the time I'm happy...
The much more interesting challenge is to get the linux kernel drivers
to shutdown their hardware well enough that they can still drive the
hardware when linux restarts.  And if the hardware can't do that it is
buggy...
