What weirdnesses? Did you actually see any?  Hard data please.
I don't like this because right now it will effectively disable TSC use
on anything with pstate invariant TSC and using cpufreq: that is all
modern AMD systems. This is IMHO a serious bug in the timer subsystem which
I intend to fix.
Also I don't see where your instability should come from.  AFAIK 
there are only minor hickups in the result which shouldn't be a problem IMHO.
