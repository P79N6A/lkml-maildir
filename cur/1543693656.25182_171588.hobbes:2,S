This is something that sys_statfs() could do on its own. It's probably 
always better to try to scale the block size up than to return EOVERFLOW.
(Some things can't be scaled up, of course, like f_ffree etc. But it 
should be trivial to just do a "try to shift to make it fit" in the 
vfs_statfs_native() function in fs/open.c).
