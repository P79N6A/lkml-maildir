Hello,
I am currently running kernel 2.6.3 on my Dell Inspiron 8500 laptop.
I disabled all the ACPI and APM options in the kernel.
I have upgraded my bios
I have tried from kernel 2.4.23 up to mm and love-sources and my current kernel 2.6.3.
What happens is during heavy loads my cpu drops from 2.60GHz down to 1.20GHz, this happens for a few minutes, say 5 - 10 at the most. But performance while running a game, puts the game into slow motion. (Which  is weird because 1.20GHz should be more than enough to run all of the  games I currently have). I have read up on the documentation in /usr/src/linux/Documentation, under the "power" and "cpu-freq" but after disabling ACPI and such, those options do not seem to work anymore.
I have also tried running a program called "cpufreqd" which launches at boot time, but once again without ACPI enabled in the kernel this seems  not to work either. Also /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/ has the following files.
cpuinfo_min_freq
cpuinfo_max_freq
scaling_min_freq
scaling_max_freq
I even tried to echo the options at bootup:
echo 2600000 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq &
echo 2000000 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_min_freq &
I tried to make those files set at: 2.00GHz min and 2.60GHz max, but something changes them right back to 1.20GHZ no matter what I do.
I am sure I am missing something, but atm I am totally lost.. and I could surely be doing everything wrong to begin with... that is why I am asking for help.
Is there a patch or anything to force the cpu to run at 2.60GHz all the time?
Thank you
