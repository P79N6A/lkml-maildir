Any reason _why_ they would want to break tons of existing code in this
manner?  Just the fact that the __func__ symbol is there to use?
Since the C99 spec does not state anything about __FUNCTION__, changing
it from the current behavior does not seem like a wise thing to do.
Any pointers to someone to complain to, or is there no chance for
reversal?
