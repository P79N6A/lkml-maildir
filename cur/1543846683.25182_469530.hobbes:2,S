Hi guys,
I have a problem when running off a nfs mounted root filesystem. The 
kernel (2.6.18) mounts the root filesystem successfully. However, when 
fstab is accessed I get the following error:
  Can't find / in /etc/fstab
The fstab looks like this:
none            /tmp                    tmpfs   rw              0       0
none            /proc                   proc    defaults        0       0
none            /sys                    sysfs   defaults        0       0
I add the following line to fstab:
192.168.1.8:/tftpboot/carlos/ppc /     nfs     
rw,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,timeo=14,intr              0       0
and now I get the following error:
  mount: Mounting 192.168.1.8:/tftpboot/carlos/ppc on / failed: Protocol 
not supported
Do you know what I'm doing wrong ?
Thanks,
Carlos
