No, the reserve does not depend on SLAB, and I totally short-circuit the
SLAB allocator for skbs and related on memory pressure.
The memalloc reserve is on the page allocator level and is only
accessable for PF_MEMALLOC processes or __GFP_MEMALLOC (new in my
patches) allocations. (arguably there could be some more deadlocks wrt.
PF_MEMALLOC where the code under PF_MEMALLOC is not properly bounded,
those would be bugs and should be fixed if present/found)

SLAB reclaim is painfull and has been tried by the time you OOM.
