	So, maybe it would be a nice idea to remove it from the 2.5.X
kernel to force a "spring cleanup" of the old code. If it's no longer
usable and only confusing, it should be purged...

	And it might even want to be defined in include/linux/sched.h
as a replacement for interruptible_sleep_on(). It seems like a generic
need, and I would feel much safer if one of the guru wrote it properly
for me ;-)
