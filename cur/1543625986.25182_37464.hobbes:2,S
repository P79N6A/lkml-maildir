That is not an ATA interface, it is Media Bay transport.
I will bet you they have not on a native 40-pin header that a ribbon
connects.  Everyone is thinking it is easy, but it is not.
There was one company how got it correct, but I do not know if they are
still around.  The solution is not CHEAP, it requires total HOST vender
unique callers and special state diagrams.  Also this was a true
Master/Slave pair solution, the hook was it broke the timing skews on the
buss. Thus Ultra33 or mode 2 as the limit.
