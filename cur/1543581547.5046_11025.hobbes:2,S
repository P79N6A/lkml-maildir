What does a message like 'ext2: block > big' indicate?
This was kernel 2.2.18aa2.
The machine was completely unresponsive when I got there.  There were a
bunch of block>big messages on the screen, but no oops.
In my grogginess, I didn't have the sense to copy down the whole message,
but it did also mention the device (8,9?).  The major 8 scsi devices in use
are three partitions of one disk -- two 15GB and one 50GB.
