Mutliboot support would be nice, not sure about the module loading thing.
But there's a bunch of issues with the paches:
(1) please port to 2.6 first because
      (a) there's not chance this will get into 2.4
      (b) 2.6 has the inkernel module loader so you don't have to duplicate
          so much loader code.
(2) please convert from GNU to Linux style
(3) please use the predefined __ASSEMBLY__ instead of ASM
