Well, the kernel is managing to mount the initrd as a filesystem, and
the "waiting for root to appear" message looks like its coming from
usermode as well.  So I suspect its something to do with module loading,
but I can't imagine what at the moment.
Statically compiling the scsi/ahci/etc drivers will help make some
progress in debugging this.
I really can't see how its directly Xen related.  It looks like either:
   1. some bug which only appears with particular kernel memory layouts,
      and enabling Xen happens to make it bad
   2. or some kind of linker bug, possibly triggered by Xen's ELF notes
      (but I'd really expect this to break in a more basic way)
   3. ...?

Oh, you get a shell?  What does /proc/pci have in it?  What happens if
you manually try to modprobe something?  That gives us much more to work
with.
