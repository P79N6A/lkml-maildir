You need to read the build instructions for a Fedora Core distribution. 
Briefly however, modern distros rely upon an initial RAMdisk which sets 
up various hardware drivers before changing the root filesystem with the 
pivot_root utility and booting the main system proper.
There's probably a missing mkinitrd et al. in there.
Cheers,
Jon.
