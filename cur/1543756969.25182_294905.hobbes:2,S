Now that's pathetic!
You recognize that point 2. is precisely the reason Linux is all about
in first place? Remind you: Linux - a free UNIX/POSIX system
clone done by people who where previously working on UNIX in first place
and just wanted a free version of it. By definition it is just that...
And in this copy-cat community you intend to thrive as "Mother Theresa" 
of SCM?
You still wonder why you provoke disgruntling?
