Bullshit.  You're in 16 bit mode, and your segment limits are only 64K 
in size, so you HAVE to use a segment:offset type addressing:
Thus, you want to do something like this.
	movl	cmd_line_ptr, %esi
	movl	%esi, %eax
	shrl	$4, %eax
	mov	%ax, %es
	andw	$0xf, %si
... and then address it through es:si.  Anything else is total, utterly 
and completely wrong.
