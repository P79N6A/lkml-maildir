Hi All,
Excuse any duplication miss-posting, or stupidity on my part here, but I've
not been able to get the Rage 128 frame buffer driver to work under any
kernel version, and I've tried as far as 2.4.19, and 2.5.42. I've fiddled
with umpteen configuration options that might be related, and peeked at the
source, yet I still can't work it out...
Here's the last steps of what I get when compiling... (give or take
linewrap..)
gcc -Wp,-MD,drivers/video/.aty128fb.o.d -D__KERNEL__ -Iinclude -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer
-fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2
-march=k6 -Iarch/i386/mach-generic -nostdinc -iwithprefix include   
-DKBUILD_BASENAME=aty128fb   -c -o drivers/video/aty128fb.o
drivers/video/aty128fb.c
drivers/video/aty128fb.c:419: unknown field `fb_get_fix' specified in
initializer
drivers/video/aty128fb.c:419: warning: initialization from incompatible
pointer type
drivers/video/aty128fb.c:420: unknown field `fb_get_var' specified in
initializer
drivers/video/aty128fb.c:420: warning: initialization from incompatible
pointer type
drivers/video/aty128fb.c: In function `aty128fb_set_var':
drivers/video/aty128fb.c:1379: structure has no member named `visual'
drivers/video/aty128fb.c:1380: structure has no member named `type'
drivers/video/aty128fb.c:1381: structure has no member named `type_aux'
drivers/video/aty128fb.c:1382: structure has no member named `ypanstep'
drivers/video/aty128fb.c:1383: structure has no member named `ywrapstep'
drivers/video/aty128fb.c:1384: structure has no member named `line_length'
make[2]: *** [drivers/video/aty128fb.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [drivers/video] Error 2
make: *** [drivers] Error 2
Seems to be related to the struct fb_fix_screeninfo (instantiated as "fix"
on those lines), and the struct display (instantiated as display there) not
having fields that the driver thinks they should do, but I couldn't see any
#ifdef's relating to those structure members, so I'm stuck...
My .config is attached.
Any help in sorting this would be much appreciated.
Yours,
Kev.
