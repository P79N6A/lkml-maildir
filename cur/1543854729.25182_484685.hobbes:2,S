Yeah, that's what I'm currently doing and the box seems more stable
(at least it has not crashed yet, but with 4K stacks it usually would
have by now).

Could the size of my devices be part of the cause? some of the logical
volumes I have mounted are multiple TB in size?

I realize that fixing the problem may be difficult. I just wanted to
make sure that people were informed that there is an actual problem
and provide as much info as possible so that perhaps in the future it
can be fixed... :)
I'm reading through the XFS code myself at the moment and I'll be sure
to submit patches if I spot something that could help reduce stack
usage.

Thanks, I'll check that out.

You are welcome. If you want/need more traces then I've got ~2.1G
worth of traces that you can have :)
Thank you for your reply.
