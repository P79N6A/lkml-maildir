It's a 5 port PCI-Addon-Card, no front panel connectors.
(The computers has only an OHCI/USB 1.1 controller onboard, which i use
for keyboard & mouse)

It'd guess that too, but who can that say for sure. :-|

Real Programmers consider "what you see is what you get" to be just as

wants a "you asked for it, you got it" text editor -- complicated,
cryptic, powerful, unforgiving, dangerous.
