I don't think API are changing so much, and documenting the way drivers SHOULD
interact with the kernel is a good thing. This also make things easier for people to
write
new drivers.
You'd also agree that as time will go by, we'll  have more and more drivers, and
we'll have to wait
for ALL to be stable to release anything.

Anybody wanting to create something with a certain size proceed this way.

When developping a part of the kernel, developpers may wish to focus to that
particulary part, without
caring about other bugs......
