I can't reliably reproduce the problem, but I have now heard reports of
the same problem from at least three other people.  I have:
[xanni@kira xanni]$ egrep -i -e 'apm|acpi' /usr/src/linux/.config
# CONFIG_ACPI is not set
CONFIG_APM=y
# CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_USER_SUSPEND is not set
CONFIG_APM_DO_ENABLE=y
CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE=y
CONFIG_APM_DISPLAY_BLANK=y
# CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_MULTIPLE_SUSPEND is not set
# CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_SUSPEND_BOUNCE is not set
# CONFIG_APM_RTC_IS_GMT is not set
# CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS is not set
# CONFIG_APM_REAL_MODE_POWER_OFF is not set
[xanni@kira xanni]$ apm -v
APM BIOS 1.2 (kernel driver 1.13)
AC on-line, battery charging: 100% (3:00)
[xanni@kira xanni]$ apm -V
apm version 3.0beta4
Note that unlike those who reported no problems, I do not have RTC_IS_GMT
(though I don't know if that's coincidental).
I'll try 2.3.99pre and see how that goes.
Hope that helps,
