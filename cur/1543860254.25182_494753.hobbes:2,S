Well, as said in the patch description, I compiled alpha, arm, i386, ia64, 
mips, powerpc, and x86_64 with allnoconfig, defconfig, allmodconfig, and 
allyesconfig as well as a few randconfigs on x86_64. I also checked that 
no new warnings were introduced by the patch.

Sure. But from my experience (I started posting these patches almost five 
years ago, inspired by a blog entry by davej) actually the only thing that 
prevents removing the sched.h include (other than using symbols defined 
there) is dereferencing current, which my scripts also check.
