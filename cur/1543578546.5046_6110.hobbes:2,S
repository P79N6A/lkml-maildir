So you have just wrote kernel2.4 OVER your kernel2.2.
Kernel tarballs always untar and give a directory named 'linux'. So suppose
you have a setup like:
ls /usr/src:
linux -> linux-2.2.5
linux-2.2.5
If you untar linux-2.4.0.tar.gz in /usr/src, it writes over 'linux' that points
to you 2.2.5.
What I usually do is
rm -f linux (is just a link)
gtar zxf linux-2.4.0.tar.gz (gives a new REAL directory named 'linux')
mv linux linux-2.4.0
ln -s linux-2.4.0 linux
I don't know why kernels are not tarred as linux-X.X.X, but there will be
a reason, I suppose... (that will ease very much everyone's life).
