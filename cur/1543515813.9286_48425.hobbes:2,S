Ehrm, I suffer from the __tiny__ problem that my computer doesn't boot
properly with the v2.3.xx kernels... This is because of a bug in the
ibmmca SCSI driver... Most annoying.
However, I'll try to set up an experiment-box of sorts that isn't using
MCA (oh, horrible though, having to use ISA?! Gahh!) and begin testing.
I consider the v2.3.xx series a little too unstable to test on our
web-servers...
