Actually, in some cases, such as summit, we only have one header file
that is different from generic. We don't want to replicate all the
generic .c files, So in that case MACHINE_C := mach-generic and
MACHINE_H := mach-summit. 
There very well could be a better way to do this, but splitting up the
.h files which fall back to generic nicely, and the .c files which don't
seemed to make the most sense.

I agree, it could be cleaned up. I'll see if I can't clean it up
further.
thanks for the feedback
