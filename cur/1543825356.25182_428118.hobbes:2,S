it's not really a workaround, it's a "separate the uses" thing. The real
problem is an inherent hierarchy between "disk" and "partition". Where
lots of code assumes you can first take the disk mutex, and then the
partition mutex, and never deadlock. This patch basically separates the
"get me the disk" versus "get me the partition" uses.
