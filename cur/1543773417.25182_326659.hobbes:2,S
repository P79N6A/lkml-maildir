Subject: Tuner module is too verbose

I upgraded from my previous kernel (2.6.10-mm1) to 2.6.12-mm1 today.
I have a problem with the "tuner" module : it is printing too many
messages into the syslog :
"tuner 2-0060: Cmd VIDIOCSCHAN accepted to TV"
or
"tuner 2-0060: Cmd VIDIOCGAUDIO accepted to radio"
(about 26 messages per second, but only when watching TV)
I looked into the module's source code and I was able to disable those
messages with a little modification (patch included).
(maybe the same modification is needed when CONFIG_TUNER_MULTI_I2C is
defined)
I don't know if this is the good way to do this, but I didn't find any
other way to solve my problem...
PS : I'm not subscribed to the list so please CC me.
