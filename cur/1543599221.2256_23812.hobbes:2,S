A nit: I think it's a MRU list you want. If you are reading
ahead (let's have caps for a page that has been used for reading,
as well as read from the disk, and lowercase for read-ahead that
has not been used):
	ABCDefghijklmnopq
             |            |
            read         disk
	   ptr          head
and you want to reclaim memory, you want to drop (say) 'pq'
to get
	ABCDefghijklmno
for two reasons: firstly because 'efg' etc. are most likely
to be used NEXT, and secondly because the diskhead is nearer
'pq' when you (inevitably) have to read it again.
This seems even more imporant when considering multiple streams,
as if you drop the least recently 'used' (i.e. read in from disk),
you will instantly create a thrashing storm.
And an idea: when dropping read-ahead pages, you might be better
dropping many readahed pages for a single stream, rather than
hitting them all equally, else they will tend to run out of
readahead in sync.
