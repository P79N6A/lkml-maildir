Especially since he forgot:
TASK_ZOMBIE
TASK_STOPPED
TASK_SWAPPING
I don't know about the last two but TASK_ZOMBIE must be handled
correctly or the task will never clear.
In general, a task must run till it gets to schedule() before the actual
state is "real" so the need for the TASK_PREEMPT.  
The actual code generated with what you propose should be the same (even
if TASK_RUNNING != 0, except for the constant).
