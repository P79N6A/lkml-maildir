One reason these occur is `scheduling in interrupt'.
Yesterday or the day before I have been looking at aha1542.c stuff,
and the same Oops occurs there:
The error recovery code in scsi_error.c hold the io_request_lock.
Thus, the interrupt routine do_aha1542_intr_handle() cannot proceed.
But this error recovery code calls scsi_sleep(), which releases the
lock and then sleeps. The following schedule() panics.
[The above Oops does not sound like a scsi_error one, but might
have a similar cause.]
