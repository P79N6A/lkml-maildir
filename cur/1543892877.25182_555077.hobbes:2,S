Sounds good to me, although I think my preference would be to extend
the "create()" subsystem callback with a "struct task_struct
*clone_task" parameter that indicates that clone_task is cloning its
own container; a subsystem like cpusets that needs to do additional
setup at that point could inherit settings either from the parent or
from clone_task's container (or something else) as desired. (It could
also do permission checking based on properties of clone_task, etc).
