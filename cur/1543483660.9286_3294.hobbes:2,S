The TGA driver is 100x faster than the 2.0 version but I'm curious about
one thing I've noticed it do from time to time. I'll be using mutt to read
e-mail and I'll do a full screen redraw.. it'll only be one line in particular
but I can watch it draw the last character that is going to be on the line..
like:
!
H!
He!
Hel!
Hell!
Hello!
Keeping in mind those above are redrawing on top of each other (like it should)
but drawing that line will take FOREVER yet the rest of the screen redraws
instantly.
I browsed tgafb.c but really didn't see anything obvious. I'd be tempted to
hack it up a bit since the 60hz stuff gives me headaches.. anyone have any
clues why it would be doing this?
Setup:
DEC Alpha UDB 166mhz
8-bit plane TGA mode
2.2.0, 2.2.1, 2.2.1-ac2 all result in the same. :)
Can provide more info if needed.. can anyone point me to specs on the TGA
chipset itself? The programming code seems to use "magic numbers" to program
the chip and I'm curious what it takes to make it use 75hz instead of 60. :)
Thanks!
