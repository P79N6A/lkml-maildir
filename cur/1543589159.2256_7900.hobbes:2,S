It does not even do that - as of 2.4, the VFS in the kernel also knows how
to cache a filestructure itself. It's in the dentry-cache. So ramfs just
provides the thin mapping between VFS operations and the VFS caches
(dentries, inodes, pages) like any other 2.4 filesystem - with the
difference that ramfs does not need to know anything about actually
transferring the cache entries to a backing store (a physical filesystem).
Take a look at fs/ramfs/inode.c, it's just some hundred odd lines of
code and worth reading to find out more about how 2.4's VFS works.

Don't think so, for the above reason.
