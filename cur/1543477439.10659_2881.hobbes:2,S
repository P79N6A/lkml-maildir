Nah. DOSemu, at least, emulates an SB16 card, by using the normal linux
sound interface (IIRC anyway). Perhaps it is/was possible to use the SB16
directly from inside DOSemu, bypassing the normal driver, but that'd be very
errorprone behaviour anyway. Not sure about WINE, but i dont see why one
would give direct access to soundcard hardware from inside DOSemu or WINE if
one could use the native linux drivers. Rather spend the effort writing a
linux driver for that sound card :)

It's worse than that... Linux needs to standardize 'advanced sound options'
some way, provide an API for it, which includes room for future crufty
soundfeatures. I believe there is work going on in that area, haven't been
reading my Freshmeat faithfully lately, due to lack of time :P
