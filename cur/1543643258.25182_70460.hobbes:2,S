Hello,
Since I upgraded 2.4.18 -> to 2.4.19,
my on-board (VAIO GR) eepro100 ethernet card hangs
when traffic gets above ~10 KB/s.

	etc...
I fed the 2.4.18 eepro100 driver to the source tree of .19, recompiled,
and now it works fine again.
Hope it wont be that way on all the future versions.
Just letting you know :)
Besides, great work, I like .19 !
Guillaume
