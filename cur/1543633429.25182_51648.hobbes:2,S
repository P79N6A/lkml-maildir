       David> How about allocating struct something using pci_pool?
   The problem is the driver can't safely touch field1 or field2 near the
   DMA (it might pull the cache line back in too soon, or dirty the cache
   line and have it written back on top of DMA'ed data)
Oh duh, I see, then go to making the thing a pointer to the
dma area.
