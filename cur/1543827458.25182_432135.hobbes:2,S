Are you suggesting everyone is going to become (= turn into, German
'werden') their own ISP hosting a gazillion of domains and renting half
a dozen root servers all over the place?
That isn't exactly the idea of being equal, equal rights, presumptions
of innocence and all that.
You're not going to kill spammers by shooting at innocent end users feet
to make them dance. The spammer has a motive to break any scheme, but if
it's SPF, what's it tomorrow?
This is just evasive talk of the SPF guys to not being held responsible
for the nonsense they created.
The SPF ppl are free to come back when the concept is complete and the
known shortcomings have been address, but until then they need to sit
down on their buttocks and fix up things.
