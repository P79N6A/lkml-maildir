No No No No No...do you really think including code for a patented
algorithm(s) is a good idea?  You are still distributing the code and
allowing people to illegally use it in countries where they are not
allowed to.  In essence you are providing a catalyst for them to violate
a patent and making yourself and other liable along the way.  US law is
sick and fucked up, and if someone sues you for patent infringement
you're most likely fucked, because you can never have enough money to
defend yourself...for the sake of us stuck in this so-called free
country (though we can be arrested and jailed without trial?) please do
not include patented algoriths in Linux...
