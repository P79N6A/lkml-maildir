Unfortunately, I tend to think that you should not be using the DMA API 
for this, since it's not host RAM.
There are loads of devices with on-board SRAM/DRAM/... you really have 
to manage your own resources at that point.
I know that sucks, WRT driver re-use.  Maybe you can wrap it inside the 
OHCI driver, ohci_dma_alloc_xxx() etc.  For the normal case, the wrapper 
resolves directly to the DMA API.  For the embedded case, the wrapper 
does SRAM-specific stuff.
You _might_ convince the kernel DMA gurus that this could be done by 
creating a driver-specific bus, and pointing struct device to that 
internal bus, but that seems like an awful lot of work as opposed to the 
wrappers.
