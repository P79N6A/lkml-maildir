Basically I'd like to have same kind of API that we have for SKB without
an overhead of SKBs.
Here is what I've done for Bluetooth HCI USB driver.
struct _urb_queue {
        struct list_head head;
        spinlock_t       lock;
};
struct _urb {
        struct list_head  list;
        struct _urb_queue *queue;
        int               type;
        void              *priv;
        struct urb        urb;
};
struct _urb *_urb_alloc(int isoc, int gfp);
static inline void _urb_free(struct _urb *_urb);
static inline void _urb_queue_init(struct _urb_queue *q);
static inline void _urb_queue_head(struct _urb_queue *q, struct _urb *_urb);
static inline void _urb_queue_tail(struct _urb_queue *q, struct _urb *_urb);
static inline void _urb_unlink(struct _urb *_urb);
struct _urb *_urb_dequeue(struct _urb_queue *q);
_urb is an ugly name I know but I couldn't come up with the better one :)
It's now easy to do things like
        _urb_queue_tail(&pending_q, _urb);
        usb_urb_submit(&_urb->urb);
and
        while (_urb = _urb_dequeue(&pending_q))
                usb_unlink_urb(&_urb->urb);
etc
