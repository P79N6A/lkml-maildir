Thanks. I will keep it in mind.
Actually now that I think about it I believe recent Intel chipsets
Tumwater/Lindenhurst work both ways but they have a bug that can
be triggered unless you are using the IOAPIC in virtual wire
mode.
In practice I still don't think it matters as everything across the
hub interface and PCI-e is message based and I don't think 2 messages
are generated.  Still I will give it some thought.
