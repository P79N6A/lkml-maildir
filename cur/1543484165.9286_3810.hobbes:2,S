It sure does not.  I had also a problem with some packages from various
machines with compiled-in bridging which my tcpdump could not decipher.
May this be the cause for the experimental status of bridging?
For my bridge(it is the only one in this net), I needed to patch br.c for
not sending out any unasked spanning tree packages(broke spannig tree
implementation), but after donig the patch, I had no problem.
The bridge is in production use now more than a year.
Besides fixing this, would you like to make the spanning tree option an
additonal option to the bridging code, or can we add a define which
disalbes the unasked sending of spanning tree packages?
