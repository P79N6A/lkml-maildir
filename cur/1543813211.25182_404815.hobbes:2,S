Why do you say that? I don't think it is particularly bad. Your sample
has an average of 2.06, and a standard deviation of 1.49 while a random
assignment using glibc's random() here has a standard deviation of 1.44
I can't remember much stats, but I think that means in your sample of
over 400, you're likely to find several instances of "6" and not
unlikely to find some higher. Actually given that it is bound at zero
and so not a normal distribution, that is likely to move results a bit
further to the right [I'm sure there's a formula for that], which is
pretty consistent with what you have, and you would hardly notice a
difference using rand()
