I guess i may have related symptoms on 2.6.13-2.6.15.1.
During disk io (eg sorting you inbox with evolution) i get :
psmouse.c: TrackPoint at isa0060/serio1/input0 lost synchronization,
throwing 2 bytes away.
The system reacts very sluggish, in fact it is completly unusable.
There are also issues with the keyboard subsystem at that times.
