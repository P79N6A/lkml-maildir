done, find the logs here:
 
http://redhat.com/~mingo/misc/100hz.log
 
http://redhat.com/~mingo/misc/1000hz.log
(one is HZ=100, the other HZ=1000. HZ=100 produces a hung network just 
like HZ=250.)
no 'rx_sched set' messages in either case. Network still hung for 
HZ=100, and is working for HZ=1000.
