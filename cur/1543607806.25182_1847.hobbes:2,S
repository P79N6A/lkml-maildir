Subject: [PATCH] tty race on con_close and con_flush_chars
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

There is a race in the console code between con_close and
con_flush_chars.  n_tty_receive_buf writes to the tty queue and then
writes it out via con_flush_chars.  The race arises in between the above
two operations; the console can close and thus zero tty->drive_data. 
When con_flush_chars runs, it will dereference a null pointer.
The following fix, by Andrew Morton, merely checks if the tty still
exists because continuing.  I am submitting the patch because the race
is uncovered often with a preemptive kernel.  The fix is in the preempt
tree, but it should be pushed to mainline since it should affect SMP
too.
Linus and Alan, please apply.
