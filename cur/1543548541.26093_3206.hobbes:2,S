Yes, ext2 has this limit.
It would not be reasonable to try extending ext2 to 64-bit times,
but milliseconds might be doable. You'd need 4 bytes to support
the 3 standard time stamps.
Going to microseconds would require 8 free bytes, which I don't
think we have. (but we do have more that one might think, due
to the unimplemented junk)
