I know the bug... Found it, when trying to explain how
all this engine is supposed to work.
eepro100 and tulip are immune. epic100 would be immune,
if controller lock was not forgotten in hard_start_xmit() there.
But rtl8139 is not safe. It is my fault and only my fault.
I have to run now, so that details are tommorow. Now I can only
bring my apologies.
