Hi,
This is the first time I post to this mailing list.
I am working with the Computer Architecture department of my
University (Carlos III of Madrid, Spain). I have to adapt an existing
(distributed) filesystem to the Linux kernel. Therefore, I am looking
for the interfaces in the Virtual File-System.
I do not know if this is the correct mailing list to post to about
this topic. If not, please, tell me.
I have read some documentation, but I have not found any reference to
the 2.6 kernel:
    - 
http://www.linux.it/~rubini/docs/vfs/vfs.html
    - 
http://www.faqs.org/docs/kernel_2_4/lki.html#toc3
    - 
http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~neilb/oss/linux-commentary/vfs.html
I cannot determine if this references are up-to-date, because I have
not started coding yet. In case they are not, do anyone knows about
newer references?
Is there any "Building a File system HOWTO"?
Thanks in advance,
Regards,
--
