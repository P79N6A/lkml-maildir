Maurice,
This constant pestering will only get you ignored.  If you don't like the
default, just change it, and copy over your .configs to all your machines
that you use.  Once you have done so, your makes on those machines will
use them (if you do "make install" to get the .config copied to /boot).
Now, the point you _could_ have made, is that the Help on KMOD says
   "If unsure, say Y"
Which to me _is_ a bug.  I just hate it when the default doesn't match the
recommended comment of any config option.
