problem is - I want to be able to explicitly close it, like Jakob's
variant is. Isn't this a functionality everyone would like?
Think about it - like - if a server of some reason uses long time to
umount its filesystems. Would it be a good thing if the server just
reboots in the middle of a umount? I think not. I beleive Jakob's solution
is quite a bit better, and it shouldn't be _too_ hard to add those extra
lines of code.
Btw: I'm implementing Jakob's way on the softdog ... patch coming later
