Some remarks:
I forgot the smiley.
If we want to get rid of a long deprecated API (as in the 
virt_to_bus/bus_to_virt case), adding warnings could help making 
maintainers aware of the fact that the API is deprecated.
In such cases the warnings are supposed to be present only temporarily 
until the code using the deprecated API got fixed.
It might not be visible for people only using allyesconfig/allmodconfig, 
but BROKEN_ON_SMP drivers often spit screenfuls of warnings. That's OK, 
and most of them have been fixed during the last years.
And otherwise, we could simply remove __deprecated from the kernel.
Andrew rejected my patch to add -Werror-implicit-function-declaration to 
the CFLAGS which helps us to avoid a certain class of nasty runtime 
errors because it turned virt_to_bus/bus_to_virt link errors on powerpc 
into compile errors (sic).
