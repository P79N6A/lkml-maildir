OK, I'll write some code to prevent multiple threads from
stepping all over each other when they pagefault at the
same address.
What would be the preferred method of fixing this ?
- fixing do_swap_page and all ->nopage functions
- hacking handle_mm_fault to make sure no overlapping
  pagefaults will be served at the same time
