Well I do have a PDC20265, so I installed the 2.6.0test5 rpm from
http://people.redhat.com/arjanv/2.5/RPMS.kernel/
That allowed me to get access to the whole drive.  I made an ext3 filesystem
on it and everything mounted real nice.  Unfortunately, now after about a
minute of hard copying the IDE channels timeout and reset.  I get the
timeout on hdg (which is the 250G drive), but the filesystem on hdf (which
is a 120G drive that I am copying from) get corrupted.  I didn't have this
problem with any of the other kernels, so I think it might have something to
do with what went in for test5.  I am still looking at that though.  I am
also going to try moving the drive that is currently hdf onto the standard
motherboard channels so that it isn't on that controller.  I hope to get the
source rpm for 2.6.0test5 and the .config for it tonight and try recompiling
with some different options.  Does any one have any suggestions on what I
should look for?
Thanks for all you help you guys have been really great.
