i think we have no choice, unfortunately.
and i think function calls are not that scary anymore, especially not with
regparms and similar compiler optimizations. The function is simple, the
function just goes in and returns in 90% of the cases, which should be
handled nicely by most BTBs.
we have other fundamental primitives that are a function call too, eg.
dget(), and they are used just as frequently. In 2.4 we were moving
inlined code into functions in a number of cases, and it appeared to work
out well in most cases.

i believe the important thing is that the function has no serialization or
other 'heavy' stuff. BHs had the misdesign of not being restarted after
being re-enabled, and it caused performance problems - we should not
repeat history.
