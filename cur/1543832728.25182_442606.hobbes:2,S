My belief is that the scenarios that lead to this situation involve error
situations -- in which case the dying task will be missing whatever
deadlines it had anyway, because it died before it could complete
its work.  So, I agree that we need the get/put_task_struct() calls,
but I believe that their job is to keep the system running in face of
application errors.  Otherwise, it would be really hard to debug the
application, right?
That said, it is entirely possible that I am missing a code path where
a correctly written application could legitimately force a high-priority
task to do cleanup work on behalf of a low-priority path.

Agreed -- if there is in fact a legitimate non-error code path, then
a patch that used some deferral mechanism would be good.  But RCU is
overkill, and misleading overkill at that!
