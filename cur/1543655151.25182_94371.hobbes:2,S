you should because it seems you didn't realize how my code works. the
algorithm is autotuned at boot and depends on the zone sizes, and it
applies to the dma zone too with respect to the normal zone, the highmem
case is just one of the cases that the fix for the general problem
resolves, and you're totally wrong saying that mlocking 700m on a 4G box
could kill it. I call it the per-claszone point of view watermark. If
you are capable of highmem (mlock users are) you must left 100M or 10M
or 10G free on the normal zone (depends on the watermark setting tuned
at boot that is calculated in function of the zone sizes) etc... so it
doesn't matter if you mlock 700M or 700G, it can't kill it. The split
doesn't matter at all. 2.5 misses this important fix too btw.
If you ignore this bugfix people will notice and there's no other way
to fix it completely (unless you want to drop the zone-normal and
zone-dma enterely, actually zone-dma matters much less because even if
it exists basically nobody uses it).
