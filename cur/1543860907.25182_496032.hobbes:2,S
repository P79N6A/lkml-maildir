These are phoneline (RJ-11) adapters, I doubt it would work with e100
or eepro100

1227 doesn't exist as a pro/100 in our database, typo maybe?

This was the pro/100 intelligent server adapter with a pro/100 behind
a 960.  There aren't too many of these out there, and they usually
require some special configuration (although they can work as a dumb
nic, but why would you want a full length pro/100 card?)

I think support for these devices can disappear (as I don't think they
will work anyway) but if someone complains we can take into account
what eepro100 did to support it (if anything) and enable it in e100.
