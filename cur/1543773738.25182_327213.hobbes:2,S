Added. Feel free to try it out, but it's very lightly tested.
You can do just "git checkout" and it will checkout the current HEAD, but 
won't overwrite anything old. Use the "-f" flag to force overwrite. 
It can also take a new HEAD, ie you can check out the parent of the 
current HEAD by doing
	git checkout HEAD^
and if you actually want to set the HEAD to that parent you can do so with 
the "-u" flag, so
	git checkout -u HEAD^
is basically equivalent to "undo the topmost commit".
It's not quite your "switch", though, because it will always _write_ to
the current HEAD, it won't be switching the current HEAD around to another
branch. I almost think that behavkiour would be more useful, I'll think
about how to do it sanely.
