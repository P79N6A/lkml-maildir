Hi,
Just wondering...  How safe is it to switch from 10Mbit network to
100Mbit network while the machine is up?
I have two cables - one leading to 10Mbit network and the other 100Mbit
when I switched the cables (I can guarantee that there was no routing issue)
from 10Mbit to 100Mbit while machine was up, it just froze solid.
I'm using 3Com 3c905C Tornado network card and the corresponding driver
is 3c90x.
Thanks
