Is this reproducible or did it happen only once?
Are there any messages that might give a hint where to search for the 
problem?
You are reporting this against 2.6.13-rc4-mm1, but are attaching a 
.config of 2.6.13-rc5-mm1. Which kernels are affected, and which are 
not?
Does it still happen if you compile your kernel with preemption 
disabled?
Please send the output of ./scripts/ver_linux .
