I can certainly see value in a "take away degrees of freedom" approach.
In fact many security approaches are just that, and that's just fine
with me, and clearly of value.
There is a distinction between really taking away a degree of freedom
and just appearing to do so + easy workaround. Which is why we're having
this discussion, to make sure AppArmor is of the former type ;)
