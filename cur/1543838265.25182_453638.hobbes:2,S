Now and ELF header(attached to bzImage) is being used to describe
the kernel executable. One program header of PT_LOAD type is being
created. The "p_filesz" field of program header is basically 
describing the vmlinux file size and "p_memsz" is giving how
much memory will be consumed by kernel image at load time.
Ideally "p_memsz" should be "p_memsz" summation of all the program
headers of vmlinux file but I guess in this case we are stretching the
ELF specification a little bit and also taking into the account the
additional memory which will be used by decompressor and decompression
logic by the time execution is transferred to the actual kernel.
The intended usage is currently kexec/kdump. While pre-loading a 
kernel in memory, kexec creates multiple segments and puts various
data into it. (like kernel image, initrd, parameters etc.) Kexec
needs to know how much memory is being used by the loaded kernel so 
that it can place another segment after kernel at a safe distance.
By reading "p_memsz" from ELF header, kexec can determine it.
Currently problem we are facing in kdump case is that parameter
segment (command line and other bootloader parameters) is being
placed immediately after kernel which gets stomped over by decompressor
code and kernel boot fails.
Normal boot never faces this problem as parameter segment is always
loaded below where kernel image is loaded.
