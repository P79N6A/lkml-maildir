The problem is not differentiating tho output as kernel or user, I just
don't want too many false positives.

The thing is, it may be OK for a RT process to run in userspace for 10
seconds without sleeping.  If this is the case, you will constantly get
this output saying you may mave a bug. But if the kernel is running for
10 seconds without scheduling, I strongly believe that is a bug.  Unless
someone has some special driver thread, I don't know of any kernel path
that runs for 10 seconds without going back to userspace or sleeping.
I still wish there was a nice arch-independent way to tell if the task
is running in user space from do_IRQ.  Maybe there is?  I'll post
another thread and ask the question.
