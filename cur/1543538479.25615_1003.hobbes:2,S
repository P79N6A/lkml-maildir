Hmm, I am at a loss then.  When I get the same file with a 2.3 kernel it
arvies in under 10 seconds (about as fast as one would expect for a 33Kbit
modem) but under 2.2 it gets the first few K quickly, then goes slower and
slower....  The hardware remains the same, the compiler used to build the
kernels is the same.  Only the kernel is changing.  Would my kernel config
help?  Anyway, incase it is I append it here.
