You may have noticed some MAGIC_ROM_PTR patches in the mtd
driver code in this patch. This is to allow XIP for applications.
We have been support XIP for quite some time on uClinux, it
works really well.
A problem we have experienced with MTD is that the nature of
asynchronous writing to FLASH does not play nice with apps
runing XIP.  Any thoughts on how to deal with this?
(blkmem does synchronous writes so it doesn't suffer any
problem. It just locks everyone out for an in-ordinate amount
of time while it does the FLASH write).
Regards
Greg
