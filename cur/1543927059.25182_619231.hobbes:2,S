Almost.. actually, I have to call those architecture specific primitives :
- text_poke : a memcpy that copies to write protected memory (disables the
  WP bit)
- sync_core : synchronize the core, only defined on x86
I'll also have to add a flush_icache_range to support powerpc correctly,
but this one turns out to be implemented on each architecture and
therefore is not a problem.
So I guess the proper way to do this would be to add :
#define text_poke       memcpy
#define text_poke_early text_poke
#define sync_core()
to asm-$ARCH/cacheflush.h for each architecture we add support for
HAS_IMMEDIATE ?
