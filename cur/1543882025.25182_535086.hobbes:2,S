I sure hope you don't do this.
Tracking these is tough, and I think you are doing a great job with it.
No release will have no regressions, there's just too many different
combinations of hardware and sometimes people don't have the time to
test to see if their original report is even fixed or not.
And some of them will get fixed with patches coming in the next kernel
release, which will then be tracked down and added to the -stable
releases.
So if you can, please keep it up, if you think it's a thankless job,
here's my hearty thanks for doing this work.  It's really needed and I
really appreciate it.
thanks,
greg k-h
