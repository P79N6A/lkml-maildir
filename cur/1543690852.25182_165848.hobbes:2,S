This is the problem - the current dynamic per-cpu allocator
(alloc_percpu()) is broken. I uses kmalloc() to allocate each
CPU's data, but kmalloc() doesn't gurantee cache line alignment
(only SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN). This may result in some per-CPU statistics
bouncing between CPUs specially on the ones with large L1 cache lines.
We have a number of options -
1. Force kmalloc() to strictly align on cache line boundary, but will
   result in wastage of space elsewhere (with your strict align patch)
   but alloc_percpu() will never result in cache line sharing.
2. Make alloc_percpu() use its own caches for various sizes with your
   strictly align patch. The rest of the kernel is not affected.
3. Let alloc_percpu() use its own allocator which supports NUMA
   and does not use an offset table.
#2 and #3 has less impact in the kernel and we should consider those,
IMO.
Thanks
