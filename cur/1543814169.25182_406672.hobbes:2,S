It certainly violates the principle of least surprise. :)
Apparently this can occur on some Alpha machines that have a
partitioned cache.  Although CPU 1 sends out the updates to b and p in
the right order because of the smp_wmb(), it's possible that b and p
are present in CPU 2's cache, one in each half of the cache.  If there
are a lot of updates coming in for the half containing b, but the half
containing p is quiet, it is possible for CPU 2 to see a new value of
p but an old value of b, unless you put an rmb instruction between the
two loads from memory.
I haven't heard of this being an issue on any other architecture.  On
PowerPC it can't happen because the architecture specifies that a data
dependency creates an implicit read barrier.
Paul.
