How do you tell if it's the same filesystem?  Frankly, I'd rather get rid of
mounting several things at one mountpoint, different or not - that would
make life much easier, but it means that we need to implement mount-traps
to make autofs folks happy.  It _may_ be doable in 2.4, but I susupect that
it will end up as 2.5 project.
