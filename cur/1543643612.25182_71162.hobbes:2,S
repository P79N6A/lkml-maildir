Linus,
The current in_atomic() check fails with kernel preemption enabled since
we set preempt_count to PREEMPT_ACTIVE in preempt_schedule().
We need to additionally check whether PREEMPT_ACTIVE is set.
There is also still the issue that bugging out is a bit drastic and a
hindrance to debugging; but I will tackle that later.  For now, please
apply this so we can at least boot with preemption enabled.
Patch is against 2.5.35-bk.
