At that site, there are apparently no 3Com drivers for 2.6 kernels (SUSE
9.3 uses 2.6.11.something IIRC), 3Com link to Donald Becker's driver
<
http://www.scyld.com/vortex.html>
 instead.
SUSE ships with the 3c59x driver (no big surprise, it's in the kernel
baseline), and this works with all 3C90X cards I've ever used (Boomerang
and Tornado series) with SUSE Linux.
SUSE Linux has no problems either with configuring this card through
YaST's LAN module, and the process is described in detail, with
screenshots, in the administration manual (chapter 22.4).
