Best of luck.  It is a complex topic, but if you manage to produce an accurate 
reference, it will be widely read.

Locking is a crucial topic.  Filesystem developers need to understand what 
locking the VFS does for them and what they must do themselves.  You need to 
cover this method by method and lock by lock.  Also note that you can't 
really understand the vfs separately from things like the page cache, inode 
cache and dentry cache, and respective operations.  It crosses over into 
virtual memory topics too, because of mmap.  A discussion of the vfs would 
not be complete without discussing the life cycles of all the objects 
involved.

You pretty much have to read the source to learn this since there is no 
authoritative reference.  As others have mentioned, Richard Gootch's vfs.txt 
document is helpful.  It is several years out of date though, and doesn't 
cover things like aio, new security hooks, dnotify and inotify event 
interface, cluster hooks, etc. etc.

It's pretty sparse.

This is the right place, or fsdevel, or both.  You probably want to post your 
drafts or pointers to your drafts here for corrections and additions.

#kernelnewbies is good, the name is a little deceiving.  Also, try Matt 
Mackall's kernelmentors mailing list and Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo's kernel 
janitors mailing list.

Thanks for volunteering!
