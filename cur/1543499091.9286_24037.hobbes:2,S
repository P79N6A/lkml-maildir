I suggest you go to the egcs mailing list archives and read
the thread (flame war??) titled "Linux and aliasing?". The first
message is 
http://egcs.cygnus.com/ml/egcs/1999-06/msg00082.html
In this thread the exact problem you are seeing here is
analyzed and the conclusion on the egcs team site is that
the Linux kernel code is broken and that they have no 
intentions to change egcs to support sloppy coding.
To quote Jeffrey Law:

BTW, Linus acknowledges that the code in question violates
ISO aliasing rules. However, he does not see how to audit
the 10 million+ lines of Linux kernel to fix all the broken 
code. This means that the Linux kernel will either have to 
live with gcc-2.7.2 and all its ancient bugs or use the
-fno-strict-alias option of egcs.
