The specific problem was on the write side, not the read side, so AFAIK,
seq_file wasn't going to help out.  I started re-writing the whole file
to use seq_file for all the read stuff, and after a few hours into it I
decided to just fix the broken bit rather than gratuitously rewriting
the whole thing.
