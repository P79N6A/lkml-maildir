So far so good.

OK.  As long as the new feature is self-contained, it will often be
included in stable patchlevels (marked EXPERIMENTAL).  If it isn't, the 
developer will have to maintain it in parallel until the next devel
branch is opened up.  This is as it should be.

This is where your argument breaks down.  Did you check patch 2.3.0?
The compressed patchfile is even smaller than its own PGP signature.
In other words, the act of opening a new development branch does not
automatically break things.
Here's what really happens.  Status quo:
  * developer develops against 2.1.x, then 2.2.0pre
  * Linus releases 2.2.0
  * developer keeps developing against 2.2.x
  * Linus forks 2.3.0
  * developer now has a choice: go with the 2.3.x series, or stay with
    the 2.2.x series, or #ifdef for both
What you are suggesting:
  * developer develops against 2.1.x
  * Linus releases 2.2.0pre and 2.3.0
  * developer now has a choice: go with the 2.3.x series, or stay with
    the 2.2.0pre/2.2.x series, or #ifdef for both
What is the difference, really?

As long as you have two separate branches of maintained codebase, you
will have this problem.  Developers have the choice: try and keep up
with multiple branches, or not.  Your proposal would not change any of
that.
