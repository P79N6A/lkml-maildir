I have seen quite a few posts regarding unable to open an initial console, but my system seems to have the necessary things in place so I come looking for help.  I have not yet subscribed to this mailing list so please CC the responses to me.  Quick summary before we get to console output, this is running on a PXA270 with 16MB flash at 0x00000000, 128MB RAM at 0xa0000000.  I am able to bring up U-boot and run ls /dev and the console appears there.  The only components on the board are memory so I am just going for a basic boot for now.  I guess my question is, what are some of the reasons for the console not to start.  Also just as a side note, the kernel appears to continue past "Warning: unable to open an initial console." And find /sbin/init but then goes to an idle loop.  With that said here is the output so hopefully we can fix it.  I am fairly new to linux so if I missed anything let me know.
Thanks,
