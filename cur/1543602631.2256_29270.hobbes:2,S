Hey, thanks for finding out what my problem is!
Yes, 2.4.9 worked rock solid, 2.4.10 almost instantly crashes
after init got control: That's why, because my webcam takes
pictures every minute via crond.
[I already put a quite simplicistic report on this on this list]
My Webcam is a Creative Webcam 3 (USB). I don't use modules but have the
drivers compiled into the kernel (Hope your explanation on what happened
is still valid.)
Greetings,
Enver
