I don't understand why it get's Input overruns when it sends a single key.
"Input" seems not to have any problem.
Could there be an event meant for output misrouted to input - messing things
up?

I think so. Once this message shows up, it is essentially unusable.

Interrupts - no, I copied gigabytes to/from USB hard disk, 
eth0 and yenta on PCI are fine too.
Device - how to verify?
Could it be a "misunderstanding" between device and driver?
 - driver (seing new device) want's  to assign address to device
 - device (plugged in, reset), sees a line status changed and 
   want's to send respective event to driver

Could it be that - device (plugged in, reset), sees _no_ line status changed
and has nothing to send. 
Perhaps there is a sequencing problem somewhere, and it works by chance.

It's not loaded on boot, but only when needed. The scripts:
usb1)
  if [ ! -e /proc/bus/usb ]; then
    echo Loading USB
    modprobe usbcore
    mount -t usbdevfs usbdevfs /proc/bus/usb
    modprobe ohci_hcd
    modprobe sd_mod
    modprobe pl2303 
    modprobe lp
  fi
  ;;
usb0)
  echo Unloading USB
  rmmod  usb-storage sd_mod scsi-mod
  rmmod pl2303 usbserial
  rmmod  lp parport
  rmmod  ohci_hcd 
  umount usbdevfs
  rmmod  usbcore
  ;;
Perhaps this is too dumb and I should do some checking along the way,
however joe user should be unable to oops things up...
