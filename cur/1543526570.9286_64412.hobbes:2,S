Just compile kernel with devfs, add
append="root=/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/partXX"
(or where are your root is placed) and try to fire up system.
System will complain loudly on your "broken" /etc/fstab and you'll be
able to enter root password (in most distributions -- this is userland
issue) and fix it. Then you'll need to fix /etc/inittab and pile of
distribution specific files... Installation of devfs is VERY
distribution-specific thing (especially now when there are no compatibility
entries by default)... All needed technical background is in mentioned
directory...
If you can not imagine how your root will be called after reboot just
fire new kernel and look on screen: you'll see needed stuff there.
Just "part1", "part2", "part3" and so on will be called "p1", "p2", "p3" and
so on.
To Gooch: BTW why it's so ? To confuse innocent souls ?
