I believe that potassium hydroxide, an extremely alkaline chemical, is 
involved with tantalum capacitors only.  For electrolytics, its 
always been, and probably always will be, Ethylene Glycol to replace 
the air in the kraft paper foil seperator, and furnish a high 
dielectric constant, several times that of air.  "Antifreeze", yes 
but without any inhibiters, none, technical pure grade only.  
Resistance in CM3 measured in siemans if you have a meter that goes 
that high.  Most don't.
It doesn't take much on a per cap basis though.  I almost 
single-handedly caused a nationwide shortage of capacitors one winter 
back in the 70's when I needed some pure stuff for the tv transmitter 
I was in charge of at the time.  Seems that during the OPEC oil 
embargo, the only 55 gallon barrel of any kind of ethylene glycol in 
the whole country was a barrel of technical grade, sitting on the 
dock of the Mobil distributor 100 miles down the road in Omaha NE.  I 
probably ran up a 500 dollar phone bill just finding it because I 
started at the refineries on the coasts.
It was either pay the about 10 bucks a gallon for it or go off the 
air.  I paid, or rather the Nebraska ETV commission paid and bought 
that last barrel and KXNE-TV stayed on the air that winter.
It wasn't till late the next summer when the replacement capacitor 
shelf at your local electronics supplier finally started to get some 
dust cover again.  It got pretty bare there for a few months.
Another of your trivia factoids for the day :-)
