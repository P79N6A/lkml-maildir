if I understood it correctly the following functions are called in this
order:
* prom_init()                    # arch/sparc/kernel/head.S
[...]
* create_node()                  # arch/sparc/kernel/prom.c
* build_prop_list()              # arch/sparc/kernel/prom.c
* build_one_prop()               # arch/sparc/kernel/prom.c
* prom_nextprop()                # arch/sparc/prom/tree.c
* __prom_nextprop()              # arch/sparc/prom/tree.c
* prom_nodeops->no_nextprop()    # PROM
And this loops while getting the attributes/properties of the /aliases
node.
