FYI, these syscall numbers are "available", at least for
private tests:
break()                                 = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented)
stty(0x1, 0x1)                          = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented)
gtty(0x2, 0x2)                          = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented)
ftime()                                 = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented)
prof()                                  = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented)
acct(0x8048e4a)                         = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented)
lock()                                  = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented)
mpx()                                   = -1 ENOSYS (Function not implemented)
Note that nobody can even call break() from the 'C' language. The
name is reserved ;^) This is probably a good candidate for the
next permanent name change.

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
