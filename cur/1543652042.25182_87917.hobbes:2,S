	115k (max negociated speed).
	The IrDA layer report many CRC errors, that could be dropped
char or flipped bits. I see around one 2000B frame dropped every 10
frame, which would be one byte/bit every 20000B, which is roughly the
frequency of the FE in /proc.
	On the other hand, this number seems a bit low for a
configuration error.
	The serial port is configured via irattach like this :
-----------------------------------------
	tios->c_cflag     = CS8|CREAD|B9600|CLOCAL;
	
	/* Ignore break condition and parity errors */
 	tios->c_iflag     = IGNBRK | IGNPAR;
	tios->c_oflag     = 0;
	tios->c_lflag     = 0; /* set input mode (non-canonical, no echo,..) */
	tios->c_cc[VMIN]  = 1; /* num of chars to wait for, before delivery */
	tios->c_cc[VTIME] = 0; /* timeout before delivery */
-----------------------------------------
	Now, it's possible that somehow irattach did mess up this
bit.
	Is there a way to see the current flag configuration of the
port with setserial or /proc ?
