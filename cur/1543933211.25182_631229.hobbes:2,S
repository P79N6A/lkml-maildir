thanks for keeping the dc port up to date :)

no need for the - there ...

no need for the compare i dont think ?

same here

missing a space after the = ...

extraneous space with the ! there

strcpy() prob runs with lower overhead

shoudnt you return rc ?  then there's probably no need to display the rc value

similar thing ... return the error stored in pd
