Hi Marcelo,
Since 2.4.14 the ieee1284 parport functions have worked improperly for some 
drivers (CPiA, W9966 and others). Joe <joeja@mindspring.com> was quick to 
find the failure. He said he was going to send the patch to you some week ago 
and maybe he already have. If it somehow got lost in an internet black-hole 
or something I try to also send it to you. It's just a one-liner which 
reverts to pre-2.4.14 behavior.
