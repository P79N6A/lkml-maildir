That wasn't the main problem.  The real problem were race conditions
and other bugs in the LinuxThreads library, most of them have been
fixed in glibc-2.1.3.
We don't need real Pthreads (the original code uses Sun's thread
extensions), I would be quite happy with a similar library if it would
provide better performance than the current LinuxThreads library.
