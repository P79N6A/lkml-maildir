Hi Mark,
So, just to make sure I understand, your reproducer for the failing case is:
1.  Boot laptop with no card.
2.  Load pciehp
3.  Suspend laptop (slot is still empty)
4.  Resume laptop (slot is still empty)
5.  insert card - card is not detected.
Can you tell me which Dell laptop you have, and also send me the dmesg
output of the failing case after loading pciehp with pciehp_debug=1.
Thanks,
Kristen
