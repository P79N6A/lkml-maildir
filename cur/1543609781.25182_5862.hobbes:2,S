Hard sums with big matrices? Are you using Atlas? It's tuned (or tunable)
for Athlons. There are some tricks -- you need to use the gcc 2.95.x
compiler; 2.96.x and 3.x apparently slow things down. But I've seen close to
peak rates on my 1.333 GHz Athlon Thunderbird with DDR RAM (1P Asus
motherboard, if it matters). In fact, if you can use 3DNOW2 arithmetic
without your answers going bogus on you, it's even better. Try
https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=23725
for the source.
