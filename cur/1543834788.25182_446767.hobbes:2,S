That's why I relax it in the next paragraph, so you'll only have to deal 
with inode numbers iff you want to hardlink directories.

No. Don't allow dir-hardliks there, so you can't create loops so you can 
freely create them without risking loops.

If no (hardlink) directory may contain a lower inode directory, all 
parents need to have a low inode.
A legal tree would e.g. look like this:
1-+-100
  | +-10001
  | `-10002
  +-101
  | +-10101
  | +-10002
  | `-10102
  `-10101
In order to create a loop, you'd e.g. need to link 101 into 10002. You 
can't, because they are ordered.
Directories above 0x800000 aren't ordered except being greater than low 
inodes, so you can create normal directories anywhere you desire, but you
obviously can't hardlink them.
