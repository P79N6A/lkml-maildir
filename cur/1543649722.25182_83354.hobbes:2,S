But as the code you sent me isn't enabled for ACPI, I don't see how it
ties into the existing Compaq based PCI driver.  How does this work?
Are you trying to have 1 driver handle both the PCI and ACPI
functionality?

As this means there is a lot of "dead code" in the driver, you should
take all of it out.

Ok, no, I will not accept this driver then, as you are duplicating the
entire Compaq driver.  Just provide a patch for the existing driver with
your new functionality.

Hm, directly trying to sneak something by me, by just renaming a
#define.  Not nice. :(

No, does your driver _have_ to be in the 2.5 kernel tree right now for
some reason?  Can't anyone who _has_ to have PCI Hotplug support for
these types of machines (and I don't think there are any types of these
machines currently shipping, right?  And they wouldn't be running a 2.5
kernel on them, right?) just grab your driver if they really need it?

You're talking to him :)
