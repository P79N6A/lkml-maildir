Perhaps we should be clear and simple about what potential testers 
should be running at any given point in time.  With -mm, linux-next, 
linux-2.6, etc, as a newcomer I find it difficult to know where my 
testing time and energy is best directed.
Is linux-next the right thing to be running at this point?  Is there a 
need for testing in a particular tree (netdev, x86, etc)?
Cheers,
Dan
