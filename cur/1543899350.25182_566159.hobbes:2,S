This sounds like a known problem w/ some laptops. Maybe powersupply,
noisy onboard conductors at 1000Hz, entering processor P-states and
I've heard about it in context with USB too, IIRC....
As you have tickless timer enabled, CONFIG_HZ shouldn't trigger it, but
you can check this with '$ vmstat 1' and watch the in(terrupts) field.
They should be quite low.
To disable P-states follow the instructions on the link below.
As you have set CONFIG_USB_SUSPEND and it's noisy only when nothing
is connected, unsetting it might be worth a try. But, AFAIK, 2.6.18
already had this feature?
Here's a link to a thinkpad related site talking about it:

Looks like there are quite some different reasons causing it.
HTH & good luck,
