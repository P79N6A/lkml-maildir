(no they're not, Nick's ticket locks still spin on a shared cacheline
IIRC -- the MCS locks mentioned could fix this)

That might actually work, although we'd have to move the
__mutex_slowpath_needs_to_unlock() branch outside wait_lock otherwise
we'll deadlock :-)
It might be worth trying this if we get serious fairness issues with the
current construct.
