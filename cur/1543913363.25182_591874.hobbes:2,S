I looked at that but decided against it. There's too much hand-holding
and arbitrary 'automatic' crap in the Kconfig crap already, and I
couldn't see a way to do it that didn't make that worse.
As long as we no longer break randconfig builds, it'll be fine. It's not
as if people _run_ those kernels, let alone actually exercise the code
path in question.
