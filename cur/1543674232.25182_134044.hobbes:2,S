AFAIK, it doesn't matter if a distro helps another or not.  As per Arjan van
de Ven's comment, I would think any code they release in terms of header
files based on original GPL source is itself GPL, and therefore
includable/usable/modifyable/redistributable by any distro.
Red Hat (or insert other large distro vendor here) might not want to
explicitly "help" their little competitors, but they have appeared to solve
this problem (according to other posts) and there's no reason you can't base
your own work off of that...
