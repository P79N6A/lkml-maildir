Not another machine. This server currently allows only one NCP connection. 
I have no idea which KDE processes that are opening this file, though.

I guess it would be possible to use multiple TCP/NCP connections, but this 
might be a bit overkill.

I can only speak for myself, but I do believe that this is a big problem
for us and our customers. I've filed a bug in the Bugzilla: Bug 3328.
