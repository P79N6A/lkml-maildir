doh. Yes. I noticed and implemented this yesterday and it's in the 
submitted syslet code - but i guess i was too tired to remember my own 
code - so i added the wrong comments :-/ If you look at the sample 
user-space code:
        init_atom(req, &req->open_file, __NR_sys_open,
                  &req->filename_p, &O_RDONLY_var, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL,
                  &req->fd, SYSLET_STOP_ON_NEGATIVE, &req->read_file);
the 'STOP_ON_NEGATIVE' acts on that particular atom.
this indeed cleaned up things quite a bit and made the user-space syslet 
code alot more straightforward. A return value can still be recovered 
and examined (with a different condition and a different jump target) 
arbitrary number of times via ret_ptr and via sys_umem_add().
