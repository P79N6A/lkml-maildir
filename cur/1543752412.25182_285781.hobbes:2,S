I don't know that much about vendor-sec, but wouldn't the kernel list
contain roughly the same set of people?  vendor-sec also has people
from the *BSDs, I believe, but they should probably notified of Linux
issues as well (often, similar mistakes are made in different
implementations).
If the readership is the same, it doesn't make sense to run two lists,
especially because it's not a normal list and you have to be capable
to deal with the vetting.
I agree that embargoed lists are nasty, but sometimes, you have to
make personal sacrifices to further the cause. 8-(
