It could.  Just not as part of the same work.  I.e., it wouldn't be
compatible in both directions, so it wouldn't make some of the most
vocal Linux developers in that other thread happy.
But you could achieve one-way compatibility in various ways:
GPLv2+, after GPLv3 is published, and before there's a GPLv4, is
pretty much it.
One could also come up with any license that permits use under the
terms of the GPLv2 or the GPLv3.
One could also dual-license under GPLv2 and GPLv3.
FWIW, IANAL.
