 As a sidenote (sort of related topic) :
 An idea being kicked around a little right now is x86 subarch
 support for 2.5. With so many of the niche x86 spin-offs appearing
 lately, all fighting for their own piece of various files in
 arch/i386/kernel/, it may be time to do the same as the ARM folks did,
 and have..
  arch/i386/generic/
  arch/i386/numaq/
  arch/i386/visws
  arch/i386/voyager/
  etc..
 I've been meaning to find some time to move the necessary bits around,
 and jiggle configs to see how it would work out, but with a pending
 house move, I haven't got around to it yet.. Maybe next week.
 The downsides to this:
 - Code duplication.
   Some routines will likely be very similar if not identical.
 - Bug propagation.
   If something is fixed in one subarch, theres a high possibility
   it needs fixing in other subarchs
  The plus sides of this:
  - Removal of #ifdef noise
    With more and more of these subarchs appearing, this is getting
	more of an issue.
  - subarchs are free to do things 'their way' without affecting the
    common case.
