Ok, guys, how about just talking to each other without the personal 
attacks. Pavel in particular - this is more personal friction than 
anything else, since others do not seem to have the same visceral dislike 
of the patches, and there _has_ been discussion about them. 
So please try to talk out the issues rather than just trying to screw each 
other over, ok?
