Hi,
I have recently upgraded my machine to redhat 7.2 (from redhat 6.2) and I am
constantly (eg < 1 hour of uptime) getting kernel crashes which I believe
are relating to ext3.  I know I should submit this to redhat's bugzilla, but
before I do I was hoping someone on the list might want to comment as I am
sure it is probably something I am doing wrong.
The machine has previously been rock solid, and the only hardware change I
have made recently is to add an extra 64M of RAM (Total 128MB).  I have run
memtest86 on it for 10 hours with no errors reported.
The last error I get is
Assertion failure in __journal_file_buffer() at transaction.c:1953:
"jh->b_jlist < 9".  I can still switch between consoles, but cannot do much
else other than press the reset button :(  
The machine is a Pentium233MMX with a 430FX (Trition I) motherboard.
Please let me know if I can gather any more information to help track this
down.
-Robert
