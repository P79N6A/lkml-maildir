Subject: [PATCH] 32-bit UID support for 2.3.31pre1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hello. I have a new version of the 32-bit UID support patches for Linux
2.3.31pre1.
The patches are available at:
http://www.engin.umich.edu/caen/systems/Linux/code/misc/2.3/19991207/
Changes in this version:
	- updated to Linux 2.3.31pre1
	- minor removal of code duplication in ipc/{msg,sem,shm}.c
	- system call numbers changed to account for introduction of new
	  64-bit file size ready mmap() call (mmap2)
IMPORTANT NOTICE:
Due to the arrival of mmap2(), all of the 32-bit UID system calls have
been renumbered. This means that if you have been testing these patches
with a 32-bit UID glibc that you've compiled, it will CRASH AND DIE when
tried with 2.3.31pre1 and these latest patches.
This will probably happen again, as stat64() hasn't appeared yet either.
You have been warned.
You will have to recompile glibc against the new system call numbers in
order for it to work. (in the mean time, you can revert to an old glibc
that does not support 32-bit UIDs-- binary compatibility with the 16-bit
UID system calls has not been compromised)
A new version of the glibc patch should be available soon, which will also
be backwards compatible with non-32-bit UID kernels.
Thanks,
Chris Wing
