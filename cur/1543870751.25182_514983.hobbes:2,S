Not supplying that was intentional by Linus so that people
think twice (or more often) before they using such expensive
operations. A plain / looks too innocent.
Is it really needed by CUBIC anyways?  It uses it for getting
the cubic root, but the algorithm recommended by Hacker's Delight
(great book) doesn't use any divisions at all. Probably better 
to use a better algorithm without divisions.
