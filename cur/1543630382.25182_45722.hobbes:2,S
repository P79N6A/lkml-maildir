We already have that requirement for patches that are emailed to me: the 
Subject line becomes the first line of the changelog, and as a result 
those changelogs are already fairly readable.
The email-patches also tend to have better changelogs for the simple
reason that people think more when they submit patches to me than they
seem to do when they just want to check something in (ie very few people
would send an email saying "fix misc problems" as the body of the email,
yet it's easy to do when you do "bk citool").
