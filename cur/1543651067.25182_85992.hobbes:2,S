That's interesting. Perhaps it would make sense to have a fast path
that just does a string match of the to be looked up path to a cached copy 
of cwd and if it matches works as if cwd was the root. Would need to be 
careful with chroot where cwd could be outside the root and clear the
cached copy in this case. Then you could avoid all the locking overhead
for directories above your cwd if you stay in there.
