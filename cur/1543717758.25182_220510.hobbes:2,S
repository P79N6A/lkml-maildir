I think it is microseconds/iteration. Lesser the better.

So alignment changes helped.

Hash function changes regressed.

dentry size change patchset helps.

OK, I am confused. These numbers show that the new hash function
is better. It contradicts your conclusion. And why are you 
comparing 2.6.6-bk+old has with 2.6.6+new hash ?  Why not 
2.6.6-bk vs. 2.6.6-bk-with-old-hash ? 
Thanks
