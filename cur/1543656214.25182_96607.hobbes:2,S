Linus, is there anyway I can request a hook so that anything that
changes drivers/ieee1394/ in your repo sends me an email with the diff
for just the files in that directory, and the changeset log? Is this
something that bkbits can do?
I'd bet lots of ppl would like similar hooks for their portions of the
source.
