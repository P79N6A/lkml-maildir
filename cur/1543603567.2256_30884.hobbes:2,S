Hey Dick,
Thanks for the help!  A couple more questions for you...

How does this make the virtual address the same as the physical address?  Or
are addr's in the first page (or 1st MB?) automatically mapped to the same
address when you call ioremap()?  I printed out the __ioremap() addr's for
0x1000 and 0x3000, and neither of the virt addr's were equal to the physical
ones.
I tried something slightly different, which didn't work...  Should it have?
What I did was put the code to turn off the MMU at physical address 0x3000,
and jumped to it (via branching to __ioremap(0x3000)).  I think the branch
is working, since I can load the correct instruction via this reloc'ed
address.  However, running the code that turns off the MMU instead reboots
the machine. =(

Should I be looking for something else to twiddle instead of the MMU bit in
the CPU register?  You mentioned the paging bit; is this different?  Also,
what are DS & ES?
