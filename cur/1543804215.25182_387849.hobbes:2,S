It is possible, yes: the binary structure carries a version number that
allows the kernel to distinguish the various revisions that the userland
mount program supports.
That said, the concensus at the moment appears to be that we should move
towards a text-based mount structure for NFS (like most of the other
filesystems have, and like NFSroot has) so I'd be reluctant to take
patches that define new binary structures.
Cheers,
