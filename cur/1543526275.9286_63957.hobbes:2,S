How does one do the following without resorting to /proc?
1) Find what kernel is running (i.e. /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease)
2) Find a machine's free/total memory (i.e. /proc/meminfo)
3) Find what modules are loaded (i.e. /proc/modules)
4) Find what filesystems the kernel supports (i.e. /proc/filesystems)
5) Find what devices are mounted on what filesystem (i.e. /proc/mounts)
    (right now there _is_ no way to find what /dev/root is short of doing
    a stat on "/" and then stating everything in /dev for a matching dev_t,
    or using devfs, or doing what libc does -- believng whatever crap is 
    in fstab)
6) How does one find the pid of a process with a particular name
    (think killall) without hunting through all the /proc/%d/cmdline
    entries?
7) How does one implement ps without using /proc?
If I could do these things without /proc, I would be glad to adjust
the user space of my embedded stuff accordingly and save the 90k,
 -Erik
