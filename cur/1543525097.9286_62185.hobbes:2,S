Subject: sockets stuck in CLOSE in 2.0.38
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Can I assume that subject is a known problem and will be fixed for .39? I
wrote to the new maintainer for 2.0 but got no reply yet.  I have about 10
of them stuck in a 2.0.38 for more then a month, but it seems ok to leave
them there and I dont want to kill my 100day uptime and reboot.  Sad I
know.
I think it might be related to SYN cookies.  I was able to reproduce by
calling connect() in a tight loop to every port via local ethernet IP.  A
simular 100day uptime didnt have any stuck sockets that I recall when SYN 
cookies were turned off (that was a 2.0.32 kernel btw).
If anyone's interested I will supply .config and netstat output.  Box is
P150, teles ISDN, eepr100, IDE with standard kernel.
