Beta3 of device-mapper is now available at:
   
ftp://ftp.sistina.com/pub/LVM2/device-mapper/device-mapper-beta3.0.tgz
The accompanying LVM2 toolset:
   
ftp://ftp.sistina.com/pub/LVM2/tools/LVM2.0-beta3.0.tgz
The main addition for this release is high performance persistent
snapshots, see 
http://people.sistina.com/~thornber/snap_performance.html
for a comparison with LVM1 and EVMS.
Please be warned that snapshots will deadlock under load on 2.4.18
kernels due to a bug in the VM syste, 2.4.19-pre8 works fine.
pvmove is now the only major feature that LVM2 lacks compared with
LVM1.
