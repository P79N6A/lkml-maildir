Hello,
I get a lot of such messages:
Nov 28 01:00:28 sargis kernel: bread in fat_access failed
Nov 28 01:00:28 sargis kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device
Nov 28 01:00:28 sargis kernel: 02:00: rw=0, want=5, limit=4
Nov 28 01:00:28 sargis kernel: dev 02:00 blksize=512 blocknr=9 sector=9 size=512
