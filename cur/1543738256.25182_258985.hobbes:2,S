We use this already for other entities that require user context like
domain validation.  It seems to work as advertised.

It's not if you look at other drivers.  There's no harm in taking the
lock, so none of the old ones got updated, but the lock isn't needed. 
The idea is that if you're holding the lock naturally (say in an
interrupt routine) there's no need to drop it artificially.  However,
you definitely shouldn't take it artificially like you do.

And you've tested this with things like SUSE's hwinfo utility which
seems to send INQUIRIES on its own?

kmap is used to make a user page visible to the kernel.
Really, I suppose, libata should provide the interfaces for doing this
work for emulated commands.
