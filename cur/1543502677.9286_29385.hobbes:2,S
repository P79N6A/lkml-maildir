This was trying to compile 2.2.10 while running 2.0.34..........
DMA is not supported in 2.0.34 on any VIA chipset.
Regardless of the known data-corruption bugs in 2.2.10....
54 restarts of "make bzImage" with 54 sig11 errors to build a new kerenl,
I think Dan Hollis has a better line on the issue with
FIC MVP3 + AMD K6-2/450 and an under voltage problem.
