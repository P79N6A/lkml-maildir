Hi,
I can use gcc-3.0 to compile 2.4.8-ac7 but can not do
that with 2.2.19
The error message is
/home/linux/include/linux/signal.h:205: warning:
deprecated use of label at end of compound statement
sched.c: At top level:
sched.c:52: conflicting types for `xtime'
/home/linux/include/linux/sched.h:508: previous
declaration of `xtime'
sched.c: In function `schedule':
sched.c:739: warning: deprecated use of label at end
of compound statement
make[2]: *** [sched.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/linux/kernel'
make[1]: *** [first_rule] Error 2
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/linux/kernel'
make: *** [_dir_kernel] Error 2
so I would like to know if there is any patches to
2.2.19 to make it friendlier with gcc-3.0. In the mean
time I am going to see sched.c and sched.h and try to
make it work :-)
thanks
