RCS is not that limited. It's very simple to take all deltas from a SCCS 
file and put it into a RCS file:
	for delta in (all sorted deltas)
		get -rdelta foo.c
		ci -rdelta foo.c
Now one needs a little knowledge about the SCCS format. New deltas are 
added at the top and deltas have their own sequence numbers, it's no 
problem to add this sequence number to a RCS delta. This sequence number 
can be used by CVS to export the data reliable, the client would simply 
see 1.sequencenr as the version number.
If one looks now at the bk SCCS files, it's pretty easy to guess, which 
deltas are merges, so it should be really no problem to add this info to 
the RCS file as well.

Well, this wasn't the deal. Larry doesn't own the data, he can't say that 
you only get all the data, if you use bk. One of the arguments for the 
move to bk was that the format was open and the data wasn't locked in.
Technically it makes a lot of sense to move to a different format, but if 
he needs help to convert the data into proper RCS format, he only needs to 
ask, I'd be happy to help.
bye, Roman
