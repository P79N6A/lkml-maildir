You are mixing the preferred form with the editor. If you do not have
the GIMP (or other similar tool) then you _do_ have to edit the PNG file
with a hex editor, but the binary PNG file is still the preferred form
for editing.
If a firmware author uses a proprietary tool that reads the binary
firmware image, let's the user edit it, and again writes out a binary
image, then that binary image _is_ the preferred form simply because no
other form exists. And it is completely irrelevant if the proprietaty
editor represented the firmware image on the screen in a high-level
language or as assembler code or as graphics or as anything else.
So unless you can _prove_ that the author of the firmware image does
indeed use some other form as the source of the image (guessing is not
enough), this whole thread is meaningless.
