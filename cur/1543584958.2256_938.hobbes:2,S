There is room for a LABEL and/or UUID in the swap superblock, if you
would want to implement support for this.  I took a look once, and it
should be possible to add in a compatible way.  Of course, you can
always put swap into LVM, which also makes it (along with filesystems
other than ext2) immune from the nasty device name changes.
Cheers, Andreas
