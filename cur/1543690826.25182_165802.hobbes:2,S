Bzzit ... GPL_ONLY stuff is an attempt to retrict usage by removing access
to the unprotectable API.  And for anyone claiming there is not API to
protect, the kernel source is the manual to the API.  The foolish intent
and design to hide the API has caused the kernel itself to become the
manual.
This is even obvious to people, like myself, who are not lawyers.
