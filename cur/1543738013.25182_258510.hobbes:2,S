Hmmm. When somebody is sleeping in select(), waiting for that
wake_up_interruptible() call that signals that data are
present, how could data not be present anymore when the
only listener makes the call to read() the data?
Simple. It's a BUG. A no-nonsense BUG. The wake_up_interruptible()
call must be made only after valid data are available for the
listener to read. Anything else is a BUG. There are several
bugs present in the logic. The first being that it will
take some time for a listener to wake up, therefore it's
okay to signal the listener before data are ready. This
is the primary BUG. The code is just details. With the
new preemptive kernel, it becomes increasingly necessary
to perform things in the correct order. The second known
BUG is that somebody decided to remove basic functionality
to improve some benchmarks.
Now, one can update the man pages and state to not use poll()
or select() for their intended purposes, or they can fix the
BUG. It's just that simple.
In the meantime, what is the function that should be used
to emulate the correct behavior of select()? If there isn't
an answer to that, then the BUG needs to be fixed.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
