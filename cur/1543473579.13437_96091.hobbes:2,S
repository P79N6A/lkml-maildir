     I think it's 2.1.x {x>37} -- that's the point where I submitted
     the patches to Linus.
     There will still be boxes that it won't work on (Compaq EISA boxes,
     which cheerfully return "I've got 16mb of memory" to ANY of the
     published bios memory size calls, and some HP notebooks -- the
     5700CTX in particular -- which don't support anything except for
     int 13, 088h) even if you do get a 2.1 kernel that has the
     memory patch.
