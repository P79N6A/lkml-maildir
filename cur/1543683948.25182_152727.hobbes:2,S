I think someone else mentioned notification of e-mail.  Well, I get
too much e-mail for that (I am on the kernel list, after all) but that
suggestion make me think of a soft of "Check Engine" light.
In my Red Hat box there are various sanity checks that happen
regularly and they send me an e-mail when one of those items goes
wrong.  For example, if a raid disk dies or a partition gets too full
(what are others?), I get an e-mail.  It might be nice to have those
programs also light an LED.
