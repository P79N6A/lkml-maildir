I also found another problem on generic quota code.  In
dquot_transfer(), the file usage is calculated from i_blocks via
inode_get_bytes().  If the file is over 2TB, the change of usage is
less than expected.
To solve this problem, I think inode.i_blocks should be 8 byte.

Thank you for your advice.  I'll research for glibc and consider
how to implement.
By the way I think, as Avi Kivity said, it's always little-endian on i386,
is it correct?
