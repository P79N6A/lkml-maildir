Zwane,
I am trying to close all possible points where the double timer could
happen.  The object is to isolate it to hardware behavior, and determine
what the event sequence is which is committing the sin.
Once constrained, it goes to a lab where I have access to a 320 channel
or 8 x 40 channel POD digital trace/recorder to map the HOST driver
against the device(s) response.  This is a major pain in the debugging
process but it will close the issue for good.
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick
