do cleanups and unification in _separate_ patches. We do not want to 
change a SINGLE LINE OF SOURCE CODE in a patch that says "unify" and 
moves a block of code from one file to another, ok? If you see some 
obvious cleanups do it in pre or post patches (whichever looks more 
logical). That makes it totally bisectable and i can drop the bogus 
cleanup patch instead of having to drop a full unification patch.
