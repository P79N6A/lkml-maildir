They try to act like the standard says "snprintf()" should act.
And yes, the standard says to return the number of bytes you _would_ have
written, had not the buffer been to small.
(Of course, giving a negative buffer length is not ok, and the kernel 
version checking for that is a kernel extension on the standard. In the 
standard, the buffer size is a "size_t", which doesn't have the notion of 
"negative", since it's an unsigned type. The kernel version is just being 
safe and nice).
