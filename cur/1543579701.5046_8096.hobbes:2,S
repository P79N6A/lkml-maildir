Thanks! Could I talk you into doing one last run? pre8 with
include/linux/elevator.h having these values set for
ELEVATOR_LINUS:
#define ELEVATOR_LINUS                                                  \
((elevator_t) {                                                         \
	1000000,		/* read passovers */
	2000000,		/* write passovers */
Just do this mod on top of your x tree.
