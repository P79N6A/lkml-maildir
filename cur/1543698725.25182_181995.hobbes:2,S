Yep, thanks. Verified under 2.6.0-test11 (the oops was even stranger than
test8 - it seemed to get into a long loop of oopses from all over the
kernel before the mouse pointer finally gave up the ghost)
My gcc-3.3 version was:
Source: gcc-3.3 (1:3.3.2ds5-4)
Version: 1:3.3.2-4
CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER fixed (papered over) the gcc bug :)

Hacking's just another word for nothing left to kludge.
