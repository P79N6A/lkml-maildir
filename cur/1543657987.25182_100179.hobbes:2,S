In kobject_add(), with kobj->subsys = NULL, this kobject (embedded inside 
struct subsystem embedded inside struct bus_type) never gets added to 
either it's parent's list, nor to the (NULL) subsystem's list.  It appears 
that the object can be on either a parent's list or a subsystem's list, 
but not both, by virtue of there being only one struct list_head entry in 
struct kobject.
You're far more versed in how this should work than I.  Some ideas...
1) in bus_register(), don't set bus->subsys.parent = &bus_subsys, instead 
set bus->subsys.kobj.subsys = &bus_subsys.  I did this, and now find_bus() 
works as expected, but now the busses created don't have parents unless 
they're specified prior to calling bus_register(), so this doesn't seem 
quite right.

2) set both bus->subsys.parent and bus->subsys.kobj.subsys, but then fix 
the test in kobject_add() to put the object on the subsystem's list if 
possible, then fall back to the parent list otherwise.  Again, doesn't 
seem quite right.
3) Add another struct list_head to kobject to let it reside on both a 
parent list and a subsystem list if either exist.
There are probably other options.  Please advise.
Thanks,
Matt
