What is needed to let all architectures include Kconfig.preempt?
We should not advertise preemption if not supported,
but we could do this by a simple Kconfig symbol:
config HAVE_PREEMPT
	bool
And let all architectures that supports preemption do:
config "ARCH"
	select HAVE_PREEMPT
But maybe there is a simpler solution
