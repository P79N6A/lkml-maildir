I can't because I pacified it to cut down the review noise
for the patch in question last time it happened.
I can tell you one more example of things I strongly disagree with
that it does, for example, such as telling me how to document
spinlocks in datastructures.
It wants a comment right above the spinlock_t member, but this
totally ignores that perhaps I put a huge comment explaining
the locking semantics elsewhere.
It's a black and white tool in a grey world, it just sucks.  And I'd
be fine with that if people used it as a guide but people, especially
kernel newbies, treat it as gospel and a way to contribe "useful"
patches.  They aren't useful, they're crap.  Fix a bug instead of this
automaton whitespace noise.
