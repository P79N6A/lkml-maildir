yes, it did not change, but there are latent ACPI bugs/uncleanlinesses 
where it references an already unmapped table. This worked by chance 
until now, because we didnt actually unmap any tables - but now we 
explicitly map/unmap the tables via the MMU. But, i dont think that's 
the cause of the failure here - those bugs typically show up in other 
ways.

that would mean early_ioremap() should switch to ioremap() after that 
point. Could you try that, does it resolve the failure you are seeing? 
Long-term we want to have a single, uniform ioremap() interface (on 
32-bit and 64-bit x86 as well) that can be used anytime, which just 
switches to the right lowlevel method depending on how far we are into 
the pagetable and memory subsystem bootstrap - instead of these more 
fragile "can we now use early_ioremap() or should we already be using 
ioremap()" usages.
