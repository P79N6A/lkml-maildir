Hello.
Since kernel 2.2 I've got permanent problems with my Gravis Ultrasound PnP card
and the OSS driver. The problem is following: /dev/dsp0 isn't able to
play/record sound because of "IRQ/DMA conflict" messages. /dev/dsp1 is playing
without problems, but it isn't able to record :-(
I have tried all possible settings of IO, IRQ and DMA. The problem persits. Can
anybody help me? Can anybody explain me what does parameters io, irq, dma,
dma16, gus16 and sb16 EXACTLY mean? The documentation is very poor and I'm not
sure if it is io/irq/dma of the GF1 chip or of the "SB digital audio" (as in
isapnp.conf). Is there any documentation on the gus driver?
Don't tell me to use Alsa. It's a piece of crap - the sound is very noisy, like
a waterfall in background.
Thanx
