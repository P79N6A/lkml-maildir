Oh.  My expriences, starting with 2.6.7 with ACPI, are as following:
  - Suspend to RAM is triggered, for example by closing the lid.
  - If it's under X11, the system does not come back.  Display powers
    up, but it remains black.  There is some HDD activity, so it's
    probably still running.  Next time I should check if the IP stack
    is still running.
  - After terminating the X11 server, other devices on the sharded IRQ
    11 are dead (most prominently, e1000 and USB).
This is a T40p.  Behavior with 2.6.8-rc1 is apparently the same.
Any ideas what to try next?
