Hi Robin,
Thanks for your previous guidance.
 I have seperated load average (traditional) and load average per user code.
and  created a seperate file in /proc/loadavgus to collect the set I want.
 The new code has been integrated to the kernel and running well.
Previous problem  was a bug in the code.
loadavgus:
94.97 83.97 100 3.00 500 0.97 501 1.97 502 0.97 503 3.97 504
Thanks
