  If following sequence occurs, ramdisk_readpage() may clear the valid buffer
data. I'm not sure whether this really occurs, but if it does,
I think lock_buffer()/unlock_buffer() may be required.
	CPU1					CPU2

	call ext2_alloc_branch()		call ramdisk_readpage()
	bh = getblk();
	lock_buffer(bh);
	write data to bh.

							do memset()
	mark_buffer_uptodate()
	unlock_buffer(bh);
