I cautiously say I don't think that's the case. I can boot and run in 
console mode for hours, as long as I don't do anything which accesses 
the DVD burner master on ide1. Both drives on ide0 work fine, network 
works, audio works, etc.
The instant I use hdc (which *is* IRQ shared with ide0) I get the storm 
and it continues until reboot. I have tried about every acpi=, pci=, and 
noapic option I can find, without success. However, some options do move 
the IRQ for both ide interfaces to IRQ 11, where the behaviour is identical.
Under 2.4.22 from FC1 it all works fine. I do use a vaimraid driver in 
2.4 (taints kernel), but everything works fine with or without it 
loaded, and the VIAraid comes up on another IRQ in any case.
Feel free to tell me this could still be another device, but it behaves 
as if it were the ide1 (DVD) access. Oh, I did try making ide1=nodma 
without change.
Thanks for the feedback, though.
