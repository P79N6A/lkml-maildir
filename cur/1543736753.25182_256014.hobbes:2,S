Here's the quote from Ingo's mail:
In <2Jo20-7ry-33@gated-at.bofh.it> Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu> writes:
|once the NMI watchdog is up and running it should catch all hard lockups
|and print backtraces to the serial console - even if you are within X
|while the lockup happens. You can test hard lockups by running the

Does this mean there is a good reason for further investigations on why
the IO-APIC NMI watchdog doesn't work? Until now I thought it would
be ok as long as the local APIC NMI watchdog is set up.
