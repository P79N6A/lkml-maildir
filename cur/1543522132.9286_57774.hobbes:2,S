	Buildkernel 1.0 already does this; it deletes all architectures
(linux/arch/X and linux/include/asm-X) except the one it's currently
running on.  To be sure, until I put in a switch to disable this,
Buildkernel is not useful for cross-compiling, but I doubt anyone would
use it for cross-compiling anyways.
	Sparc and Sparc64 are intertwined; both trees are kept if building
for either sparc architecture.  Additionally, there's a report I'm looking
into about ppc; it appears to require some m68k files.

	Rather likely, I think.  That's what makes this project fun for
you!
	If you'd like to pursue this from a userspace perspective (as
your chances of shuffling files around in the source tree for solely this
reason are roughly equivalent to your chances of simultaneously becoming
president and being struck by lightning :-), I'd gladly consider adding
your patches to intelligently remove unneeded code.  There are all kinds
of possibilities; a good starting point might be removing support for bus
types that do not work on a given architecture.
	Cheers,
	- Bill
