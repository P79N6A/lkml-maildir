You're right that swapoff should just fail, but sadly we've not done
the work to make that so: the OOM-killer does indeed come in (and it's
not the swapoff task it attacks); and if that can't free enough, then
the system will freeze.
In what forum, by the way, may I suggest to distros that they "rm -rf"
in any tmpfs mounts before shutdown swapoff?  It avoids this OOM issue
at shutdown, plus it's a whole lot faster than doing the swapoff.
