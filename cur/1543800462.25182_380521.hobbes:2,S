I had actually written a similar script on my own before,
but I found it was near completely unusable on a 4core Opteron
system even under moderate load because systemtap bombed out 
when it needed more than one spin to take the lock of the 
shared hash table.
(it basically did if (!spin_trylock()) ... stop script; ...) 
The problem was that the backtraces took so long that another
CPU very often run into the locked lock.
Still with a stripped down script without backtraces had some
interesting results. In particular my init was reading some 
file in /proc 10 times a second, allocating 4K (wtf did it do that?) and
some other somewhat surprising results.
