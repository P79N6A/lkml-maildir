  Backup to me is a special case, not simply a copy of files, but also
  retaining all the extra data, info, attributes, etc, that comes with
  the file.
  Enabling  support  to  have  all  of  this  extra  stuff  below  the
  application  level  it  will  be  possible to retain everything even
  though applications do not support them.
  Backup tools, however, must know about these new features to be able
  to  backup  them.  And so will every tool that directly accesses the
  filesystem instead of using the OS API for it.
  And  from  I  learned  in an earlier message, tools like cp actually
  work  on  the  fs level and themselves move the data to the new file
  instead   of  letting  the OS handle it. This seem to me as it could
  be  dangerous and could also prevent any kind of enhancements to the
  FS unless every tool like cp is patched.
