Ok, next build with preempt mode 3, hard & softirq's theaded, as is 
RCU.
Kmix now normal, tvtime still fubar.
Build with mode 2 and it looks as if its all working:
[root@coyote linux-2.6.12-rc6-RT-V0.7.47-30]# grep PREEMPT .config
# CONFIG_PREEMPT_NONE is not set
CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY=y
# CONFIG_PREEMPT_DESKTOP is not set
# CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT is not set
CONFIG_PREEMPT_SOFTIRQS=y
CONFIG_PREEMPT_HARDIRQS=y
# CONFIG_PREEMPT_BKL is not set
Now, I note that going to the #2 mode (voluntary) turned off threaded 
RCU's, so I'm going to leave that off and try a mode 3 again. BRB.  
And that makes tvtime's video fail with a blue screen, audio ok..
Mode 2, FWIW, makes for quite jerky card motions while playing 
AisleRiot, the solitaire game.
