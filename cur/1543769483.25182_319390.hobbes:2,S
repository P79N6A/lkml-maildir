sure. Making it *impossible* to mmap that page is bad. People should be
able to do that if they really want to, just doing it if they don't ask
for it is bad.
There are plenty of reasons people may want that page mmaped, one of
them being that the compiler can then do more speculative loads around
null pointer checks. Not saying it's a brilliant idea always, but making
such things impossible makes no sense.
