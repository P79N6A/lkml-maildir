After installing the test2 kernel, I got a number of errors from my
IDE disk in my syslog.  Twice, my main partition, /dev/hda1, got
remounted read only.   Rebooting after the second one of these, I
found that all the files in /usr and /var (at least) had been moved
into /lost+found.
I never had any problems with that disk before using the test2 kernel,
or after switching back to 2.2.x.
The computer is a Toshiba 445CDX laptop.   
Sorry for the lack of detail, but all my log files got lost when I
re-installed debian over the disk.
