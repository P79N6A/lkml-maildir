The Dell Latitude C840 (what I have) and the (AFAIK) Inspiron 8100 both use
the NVidia geForce4 Go graphics chipset, and apparently the posted patches
to make nvidia's closed-source drivers work under 2.5 have issues with ACPI
on some platforms.  Digging back, I only found like one message on the LKML
archives that mentioned the nvidia drivers don't play nice with ACPI.
Harry - does that match up with what you have?
