Here's an article that talks about Intel's forthcoming products:

Excerpts:
By the end of October, Intel will have introduced more than 13 new
Pentium III chips for desktop and mobile PCs as well as workstations
and servers, sources said.
The chip barrage will actually begin in late September, when Intel's
820 chip set for high-performance desktop PCs is rolled out. 
The long-awaited product offers a faster system bus, support for 4X
accelerated graphics support and high-bandwidth Rambus Dynamic
RAM. 
Intel (INTC) will disclose many more details on the chip set at this
week's Intel Developer Forum in Palm Springs, Calif. The company is
expected to give attendees updates on the IA-64 64-bit processor
architecture, inroads in the network processor market with
StrongARM-based processors, and PC design guides and initiatives,
such as Easy PC. 
The 820 chip set, Intel is expected to announce, will also support two
bus speeds, 100MHz and 133MHz, sources said. Intel's current
mainstream desktop chip set, the 440BX, supports a 100MHz bus,
sources said. 
Intel will not ship a mobile Pentium III chip with its Geyserville
technology until the first quarter of 2000, sources said. That chip, a
600MHz mobile Pentium III, will vary its clock speed, depending on
whether it is plugged in and running on AC power or if it is on battery
power. When a notebook is running on battery power, Geyserville
reduces the chip's clock speed, which reduces the amount of power it
consumes and leads to longer battery life.
