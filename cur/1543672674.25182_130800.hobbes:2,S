Subject: [PATCH] fixes for linked list bugs in block I/O code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/5/7/348

I found a couple of small linked list bugs in __make_request() in
drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c.  The bugs exist in both kernels
2.4.20 and 2.5.69.  Therefore I have made patches for both
kernels.  The problem is that when inserting a new buffer_head
into the linked list of buffer_head structures maintained by
"struct request", the b_reqnext field is not initialized.
