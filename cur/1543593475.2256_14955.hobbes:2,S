This morning I was running 2.4.6-pre1 and it locked up hard in
X-windows.  The mouse cursor was frozen, and I couldn't ping the box
from another one on the network.  The sysrq did work - to an extent.  A
tried the 's u b' combination, and although the sync and remount didn't
work (filesystems needed fsck at boot - I think this means the sync and
remount never finished), the re-boot did.
System activity at the time was running a CPU intensive audio
application, which implies taking a lot of audio interrupts.  System had
been up for less than 24 hours.
I wish I had more info.
My system is a 700mhz Athlon, 256mb ram, Adaptec 2940UW, eepro100, and
sound card is emu10k1 (sb live).
