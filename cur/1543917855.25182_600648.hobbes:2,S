Have you checked your memory already (memtest86)?
We have several applications with Promise controllers on strange
hardware and we never had integrity problems with i.e. not so standard
SATA connections over custom vaccum-tight connectors.

Is this a common known problem with your harddrives or controller?
(ask google) Otherwise, it sounds like a problem with broken hardware.

Try to heat up your memory a little (your wife's hair blower).
If it fails more often, your memory is most likely broken.

Again... sounds like bad memory to me.
Juat my $0.05.
