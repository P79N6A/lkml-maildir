| 
| 
| 4) Split up your changes.  Each maintainer<->Linus situation is likely
| to be slightly different here, so take this just as general advice.  The
| author splits up changes according to "themes" when merging with Linus.
| Simultaneous pushes from local development to goes special trees which
| exist solely to house changes "queued" for Linus.  Example of the trees:
| 
| 	net-drivers-2.5 -- on-going net driver maintenance
| 	vm-2.5 -- VM-related changes
| 	fs-2.5 -- filesystem-related changes
| 
| Linus then has much more freedom for pulling changes.  He could (for
| example) issue a "bk pull" on vm-2.5 and fs-2.5 trees, to merge their
| changes, but hold off net-drivers-2.5 because of a change that needs
| more discussion.
| 
| Other maintainers may find that a single linus-pull-from tree is
| adequate for passing BK changesets to him.
So what if Linus isn't happy with the changes you made in the for-Him-to-pull
tree? How do I back off (part of the changes)?

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
