Definately some writeout sillyness.  Why would we ever stop
writing pages to disk while a transfer is going on and then
suddenly decide to stall the system because pages are being
dirtied at a rate faster than we write them ?
If we can smooth out the writing we can keep the disks busy
all the time and should in theory perform better. I wonder
why Andrew made the writeout in 2.5 _more_ bursty ...

Rik
