You'll have to be a bit more specific than that. A few problems have 
arisen in the past, but currently I don't think there is anything known 
outstanding other than one hotplug issue which currently is lacking in 
information to debug.

If sata_nv is built modular, then you may need to put:
options sata_nv adma=0
in /etc/modprobe.conf instead.
However I should point out that adma=0 is a poor workaround, it would be 
better to find the real cause of the problem.

Please post the dmesg output from when this happens. If it starts 
working after the kernel disables NCQ, then it might mean that your 
drive has some problems with NCQ..
