Sure.  There is ntpdate, intended for gross corrections at boot time, 
and ntp, which finetunes things if you need microsecond accuracy all 
day long.  I don't, so I just run ntpdate at boot time and 4x a day 
with cron against 4 servers chosen at random from a list of 33, using 
a script and a list of servers someone posted years ago now.
Both are installed in a normal full install, but not this script.  ntp 
as I understand it needs configured before its used, but it can be 
run from /etc/init.d by turning it on with chkconfig once its 
configured.
