Actually, I think Alan's (f91a3715db2bb44fcf08cec642e68f919b70f7f4)
idea of setting UART_IER_THRI after serial console writes is buggy.
If the serial port being used as a console is sharing its interrupt
line with other devices, then there's the very real possibility for
causing spurious interrupts.
I think that's what needs to be fixed rather than working around this
potentially buggy behaviour.
Maybe we have no option but to take the spinlock in the serial console
code, and suck it if we oops with that spinlock held.
