It's a case of going into the mountains wearing sandals and carrying the
mountain boots in your backpack knowing you should wear them (at least if
you read the hidden documentation.
If you can leave the sandals at home, you should do that (they are of no use
there), but the patch from this(?) thread will just make you change shoes
after leaving the house and carry the sandals in the backpack, which could
easily be done in userspace (provided you've enough RAM). The real patch
would teach how to tie the bootstraps of tmpfs before leaving the house.
