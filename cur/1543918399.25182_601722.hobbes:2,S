Hi Richard,
Thank you for the testing.
However, my patch is kind of duplicate efforts. I was taking the
'do it if simple' attitude.  I can continue to improve it if you 
really want it. Otherwise I'd recommend you to test the coming
2.6.24-rc1 or backport the -mm writeback patches back to 2.6.23 and
test it there. Peter has did a good job on it.
