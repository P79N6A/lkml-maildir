	Serial-port cards are under $30.  If it's an IRQ problem, get 
a smart board, they're not very expensive either.  And they come in
ISA and PCI kinds.  Compare the cost of having the server go down/
reboot to one, if it's a production environment, a little cash up front
usually isn't an issue...
	Considering the amount of work and effort put in by so many
developers and others, perhaps you'd be kind enough to offer up
something constructive, or keep things off the mailing list where
constructive work is happening.
