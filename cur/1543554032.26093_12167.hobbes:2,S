Last I checked modules.conf was in /etc, not in /lib.

Remember that we cannot rely on ANY form of persistent storage to be
available in the beginning; / may very well be readonly (on a ROM,
say.)  Since that means that we can't rely on writable storage being
available until at least one other filesystem has been mounted, it
might as well be the standard for variable data, i.e. /var.
