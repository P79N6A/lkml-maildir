Can't pointer-dereference errors be handled directly by any C
compiler.  Is CHECKER necessary for this.  Use an incomplete
struct pointer and the compiler will complain on all dereferences.
Something like
  /* struct user_space should never be defined.  */
  typedef struct user_space user_space;
  int copy_to_user (user_space *to, char *from, size_t len);
  int copy_from_user (char *to, user_space *from, size_t len);
  /* ... */
  #define TREAT_AS_USER_SPACE_POINTER(p) \
            ({                                  \
              BUG_ON(get_fs() != get_gs());     \
              (user_space *)p;                  \
            })
