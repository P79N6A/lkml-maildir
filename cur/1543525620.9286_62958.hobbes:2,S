I'm given to understand that they have a *lot* of working ARMLinux-based

Allow me to advance a different analysis:  the proposal currently on the 
table is *no longer research*.  I recently saw an ad in a magazine for

standalone NFS/Samba server, or run a webserver on it, etc.  NASD has moved 
beyond that except insofar as they could be components.  :)
