Ok, I guess I misunderstood that until now.

Yes, at least as long as the associativity is high enough.

Random mapping hurts those applications most that do fit in the cache
in principle, but that have enough hot memory (whether accessed
regularly or randomly) that random mapping usually introduces cache
conflicts (this will happen for many applications with direct-mapped
caches, but hardly ever with high-associativity caches).

As has been discussed in another thread, direct-mapped caches seem to
pretty standard for off-chip caches, and this is not just a
braindamage issue: Higher associativity requires more wires to the
tags, and also to the data, if you want to access the data in parallel
with the tags for lower latency.  Running a lot of wires off-chip is a
problem.  So the choices are:
- Small on-chip cache with high associativity.
- Medium cache with off-chip data, on-chip tags, high associativity
and high latency.
- Large cache with off-chip data and off-chip tags, and low
associativity.
However, over time off-chip caches seem to become less commonplace, so
we may get rid of low associativity for L2/L3 caches eventually.
