There is four options to fix this problem.
1) Change the RH9/Fedora macros.
2) Add a global entry into my .rpmmacros
3) Find and create the missing file (empty, in this case) (ie, do a 'touch /usr/src/linux-2.6.3/debugfiles.list' and it will proceed without making the debugfile RPM.)
4) Disable it in the specfile, since only RH9/Fedora does this, and Mandrake/SuSE probably doesn't.
I'm not going to do #1, and I'm not going to do #2, I'll settle for #3 or #4, but #3 now means another file to ship around or create, even if it's empty.
This simply gets it working again.
