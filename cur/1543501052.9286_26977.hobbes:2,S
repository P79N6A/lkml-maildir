Subject: [BUG] current->mm NULL in SMP version of 2.2.x

Hi,
This is my first time posting to the list, so please excuse
any silly errors I make.
I believe I have discovered a bug in the 2.2.x series of
kernels, when SMP support is compiled in.  I have tested
this with 2.2.0 (patched with the RT linux patches), 2.2.5
(standard) and 2.2.9 (standard), with both SMP enabled and
SMP disabled.  I have not been able to track down this bug,
but have been working on it.  Maybe current->mm is getting
NULL'd somewhere in the load and execute thread ... it
seems to be fine throughout do_execve, meaning it is not
NULL.  Is it getting messed up in the demand loading page
fault?  I don't have enough knowledge to debug this.  Oh,
BTW, this problem doesn't occur in 2.0.37 when compiled
with SMP support.
My tests were as follows: I create a module that registers
itself as a character device.  From within the write procedure,
I write current->mm out using printk. On non-SMP kernels,
this is a nonzero value and on SMP 2.2.x kernels, I get
a 'um_write: current->mm = 0x00000000'.
BTW, I also just printed the value of current->mm from
within 'init_module', and the open operations.  Still
NULL on an SMP machine.
Thanks in advance for any help with this or advice.  I
wouldn't mind looking for this, if I knew where to look
for it, so any hints would be nice too.  The main parts
of the test code follow.
Regards,
Christopher Boyd
