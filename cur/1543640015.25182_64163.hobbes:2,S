Yes because for most people it works pretty
fine:)

Well, it was reported that CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE
causes such noises on some machines and even
CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS doesn't fix the problem.
I have included a workaround that disables idle calls
during a playback. Are you using the latest patch from
my page (for 2.4.19 now)?
Also try disabling APM manually. If this doesn't
help then this is another problem but anyway someone is
disabling interrups for the large periods, (hopefully)
only this can cause such an effect. Make sure that
the hard drive is not active during a playback
because it also distorts sound by disabling interrupts
for too long.
