I think, the more linux users are out there, the less is the percentage
who compiles kernels often. And often means once or twice a day. Most
people use stock kernels. I think a "knob" that says "compile a lot" or
"normal" or "server" or so would be nice.
Especially because a server has very different need of swap, etc than a
workstation.
