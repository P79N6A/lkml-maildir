Actually, the issue has to do with how the firmware is generated and
the dependencies between generated and source files.  The tar file
touched all files whereas the patch touched only a few.  This is why
the tar file worked and the patch did not.
Newer versions of the driver completely avoid this issue by only attempting
to re-build the firmware if you explicitly configure your kernel this way.
