Not at all.  First of all, it is kept outside the kernel: it is more
like a library than anything else (although it _does_ run at a higher
privilege level than user code).  Secondly, in a clustered environment
with shared-disk filesystems, having no OS-facility for reliably
accessing shared data would be a critical omission.
