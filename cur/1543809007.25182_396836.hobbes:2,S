The historical posts on locking in release_dev()
I looked at suggest that a move from BKL to more
fine grained synchronization (tty_sem) was a goal.
The code looks like it originally relied on the BKL.
The later addition of tty_sem was done in a way
that allowed sleeping between setting tty_closing
and TTY_CLOSING flag:
down(&tty_sem)
if (tty->count == 1)
	tty_closing = 1;
up(&tty_sem)
...
down(&tty_sem) <<<< can sleep, open can increase count
tty->count--
up(&tty_sem)
...
if (tty_closing)
	set_bit(TTY_CLOSING)
 > (and there is no sleeping b/w setting the tty_closing

Your patch leaves the schedule() call at the bottom of
the while loop between setting tty_closing and
setting TTY_CLOSING flag.
Thanks,
Paul
