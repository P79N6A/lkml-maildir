But on UP the above alias = __get_hash_table() is not really needed. I
know that page cache code contains similar "insert unique" tricks which
hurt UP performance but why not think of a better way to approach it,
while we are at it?
At the very least put ifdef CONFIG_SMP around it and admit that it's an
ugly thing to do.
Mark spotted this issue (and a few others) but I have not seen any
suggestions on how to fix them nicely (and the conditional compilation is
not a nice thing!) without doing:
cd fs ; rm buffer.c ; think ; vi buffer.c
I cc'd the original author of the patch - maybe he has good ideas on how
to improve his own patch?

Tigran
