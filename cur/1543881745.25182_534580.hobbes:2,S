Intel 80386 Reference Programmer's Manual reads:
" When accessing a bit in memory, the processor may access four bytes
starting from the memory address given by:
   Effective Address + (4 * (BitOffset DIV 32))
for a 32-bit operand size, or two bytes starting from the memory address
given by: 
   Effective Address + (2 * (BitOffset DIV 16))
for a 16-bit operand size. It may do this even when only a single byte
needs to be accessed in order to get at the given bit. "
This seems to imply that we need the lock prefix even when updating
different bits within the same long (not just the same byte). Is this
interpretation correct?
