I thought you said in _not_ necessary, sorry. The extra read() for error 
discovery is just bogus, w/out proper Linux poll reporting. The epoll 
interface will have wait queue heads dropped inside the monitored devices 
wait queue, so I assume that an error condition would trigger a wakeup -> 
epoll event. If this is not true (but I'm pretty much sure it is), look at 
the extra read() for error reporting:
1) Good
read_loop();
--> Error happen on device
if (read() == ERROR)
 	gotcha();
2)
read_loop();
if (read() == ERROR)
 	whoops();
--> Error happen on device
