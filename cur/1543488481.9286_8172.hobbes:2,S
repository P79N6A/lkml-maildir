If you want to access the BIOS from userspace, do this to map 64
kbytes of memory starting at address 0xf00000 into user space:
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <sys/mman.h>
    unsigned char *virt;
    fd = open("/dev/mem", O_RDWR);
    virt = mmap(NULL, 64*1024, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC, 
		MAP_SHARED, fd, 0xf0000);
    if (virt == MAP_FAILED)
        panic("mmap failed");
    printf("memory address f000:0x1234 contains 0x%x\n", virt[0x1234]);
