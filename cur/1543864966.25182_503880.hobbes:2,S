A much better solution with thunderbird is using external editor
extension.
http://globs.org/articles.php?lng=en&pg=2
Install the extension.  Configure it with your favorite editor.
Thunderbird won't do a thing about your message if you turn off
linewrap.
	 For example, this line starts with a tab and a space and (double tab)		is very long and I'm writing in emacs fired up from thunderbird. (double space)  
Cheers.
