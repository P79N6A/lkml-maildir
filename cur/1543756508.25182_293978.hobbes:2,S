In the 'ISDN active card' 'Eicon' section you will find the option
  DIVA Maint driver support
which is only available as a module.
When the other diva drivers are compiled as modules too, they will provide
all trace data to the maint module.
The userspace tool 'divactrl' then retrieves the trace data according to
set trace masks.
