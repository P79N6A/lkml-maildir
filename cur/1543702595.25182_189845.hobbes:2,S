Is it a garbled mess or a 1000Hz background tone? I get the latter on
the onboard audio of my A7N8X motherboard too, it's interference from
the timer interrupt. Not sure if it's power load related or EM
interference, but I strongly suspect it'll go away if you turn off
making idle calls in the kernel config. Going back to 100Hz (or up to
10000Hz as someone submitted a patch for a while back) will probably
make the problem go away too.
