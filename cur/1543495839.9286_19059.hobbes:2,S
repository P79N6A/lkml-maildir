The 9th Circuit court has limited jurisdiction -- appropriately 
enough, its area of jurisdiction is the 9th circuit (which includes
Alaska, Hawaii, and a bunch of western states including California
and Washington state).  Most of the US is outside its jurisdiction,
so 
the recent ruling is suggestive but not binding to courts in most of 
the nation.  A Supreme Court decision would extend the ruling to the
entire nation.

Well, kind of.  People in the US could contribute to the
international
kernel.  Whether or not the official Linus kernel could contain
crypto &c depends on whether or not we want to shut out people in
France, Russia, Argentina, and other nations from using the official
kernel.

Search engines are your friend.  The first hit www.google.com gave
me when I searched for "reiser fs":
http://www.idiom.com/~beverly/reiserfs.html
which is a mirror of the homepage with links to other mirrors.
Google's a good search engine when you are searching for a
canonical page.
