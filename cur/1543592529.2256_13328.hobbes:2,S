I have now reproduced the lockup in 2.4.4, having passed the
additional boot parameters "nmi_watchdog=1 noapic".
To be more specific, it happens when switching from a vc running a
text console to the vc running X. I'm thinking that maybe the umount
NFS is a coincidence / red herring.

My video card is a Matrox G400 AGP 32MB with TV-OUT, and I'm not using
the frame buffer driver.
