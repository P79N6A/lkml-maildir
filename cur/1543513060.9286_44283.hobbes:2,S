Hello Linus,
I have written (a read only at the moment) BFS filesystem for Linux and
placed tha patch on:
http://www.ocston.org/~tigran/patches/bfs-2.3.21.patch
I cc'd Andries because I know that he has written (independently) a
similar thing. I hope you will consider including it in the 2.3.x series.
Regards,
Tigran.
PS. For those who don't know what BFS is - it is the filesystem type used
for mounting /stand slice on SCO UnixWare systems.
