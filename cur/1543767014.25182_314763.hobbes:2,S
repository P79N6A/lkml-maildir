Greetings,
   I'm having an issues with ext3.  For about 3 months the /home 
partition has had low-to-medium use/activity.. adding files, nightly log 
rotations, some mysql dbs coming and going at a slow pace..  Well, 
yesterday after I had migrated everything off of it (no files in /home 
anymore) the df output looked like this:
# uptime
 10:35:54 up 96 days, 14:22,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
# df -h
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part1
                      2.0G  483M  1.4G  26% /
/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part6
                       33G  -64Z   31G 101% /home
I did notice that if I created a file (cat /dev/zero >/home/foo) of 
significant size that I could make it look normal again.. So I figure 
it's an underflow in some count.
Crazy huh?  Well, I unmounted /home and did an fsck -f  on the partition 
and remounted it.  Then everything looked okay.

Well today on a different server (that I have not cleaned off yet) that 
has been up and running for 6 months is saying the same thing:
# uptime
 10:39:16 up 181 days,  2:42,  2 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
# df -h
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part1
                      2.0G  483M  1.4G  26% /
/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part6
                       33G  -64Z   31G 101% /home
Now, this server is still in production.  I could bring it down for a 
brief time to fsck or reboot it, but I'd be afraid to.  du -h /home 
shows that really only 268M is used.
If I create a large file (176M) in /home it then don't underflow on the 
df, but is still incorrect.
Is this a known issue with ext3? Or ext2?  Anything I should or should 
not do about it? 
Thanks,
 Davy
BTW- df -k looks like
# df -k
Filesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
