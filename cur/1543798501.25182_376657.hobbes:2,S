 Yes, it is.  However, that may be a sub-case where a single, large
 server application actually jumps around from container to container.
 I consider that a detail (well, our DB2 folks don't but I'm all for
 solving one problem at a time ;-) and we can work some of that out
 later.  They are less concerned about the application being shared
 or part of multiple "classes" simultaneously, as opposed to being
 appropriately resource contrained based on the (large) transactions
 that they are handling on behalf of a user.  So, if it were possible
 to jump from one container to another dynamically, then the appropriate
 resource management stuff could be handled at some other level.

 Desired, but primarily for large server applications.  And, I don't
 think I see much in this patch set that makes that infeasible.  If
 containers are going to work, you are going to have to have a mechanism
 to get applications into them and to move them anyway, right?  While
 it would be nice if that were dirt-cheap, if it isn't, applications
 may have to adapt their usage of them based on the cost.  Not a big
 deal as I see it.
