The main point of bforget (the thing that if I remeber well was doing also
before we start playing with it) is to avoid to sync data that make no
sense anymore. So we can't use buffer_busy that would check also for the
dirty and protected bit (yes my patch was really a mistake but I
understood only now how the ramdisk works and why it's safe (and nice) to
forget a protected/ramdisk buffer). Before to see the light ;) I couldn't
convince myself that forgetting a protected buffer was obviosly right...
