Dear diary, on Sun, Apr 24, 2005 at 01:00:23AM CEST, I got a letter
where Pavel Machek <pavel@ucw.cz> told me that...
> I created three trees here (with git fork): one ("clean-git") to track
> your changes, second ("linux-git") to do my development on and third
> ("linux-good") for good, nice, cleaned-up changes, for you to merge.

You can't do any better than that, since you would have to transfer
stuff around by pulling them otherwise; so you would need smart git
pull, but then Linus can use the smart git pull himself anyway. ;-)
