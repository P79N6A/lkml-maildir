Greetings;
Specifically, I can smbmount AND smbumount a share on another machine 
for boots up to and including 2.6.10-rc3, what I'm running now.
I cannot smbumount (or umount) that same external share when running 
2.6.10-rc3-mm1-VO.33-04 *or* 2.6.10.  The unmount command *thinks* 
the share is busy when all other paths have already been closed.  
This points the finger toward something in the -rc3-mm1 patch 
according to my SWAG.
I think this may be connected to my amdump failures where amandad 
turns into a zombie at some point in the estimate phase an 
uncomfortably large percentage of the time.
But I don't know how, AFAIK in my configs for amanda, it is using its 
own sockets and not anything from samba.
