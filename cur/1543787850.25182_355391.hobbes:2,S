Fair enough. Bad example from my part.
My main argument still remains. It is useful to handle NULL in some
release functions (iounmap and release_resource come to mind) because it
simplifies releasing a partially initialized state. Grep for NULL checks
around iounmap() and release_resource() calls for existing usage in the
drivers...
