I don't understand why you're so opposed to organizing the kernel's
exported symbols in a more self-documenting way.  It seems pretty
clear to me that having a mechanism that requires modules to make
explicit which (semi-)internal APIs makes reviewing easier, makes it
easier to communicate "please don't use that API" to module authors,
and takes at least a small step towards bringing the kernel's exported
API under control.  What's the real downside?
