Yeah. Well it is trivial to leave ZERO_PAGE in get_user_pages, however
in the longer run it would be nice to get rid of ZERO_PAGE completely
so we need an alternative.
I've been working on a patch for core dumping that can detect unfaulted
anonymous memory and skip it without doing the ZERO_PAGE comparision.
