I fail to see the connection between filesystem and proceses being able (or
not) to bind to a low port, for instance. OK, so if your httpd resides on
FAT, it has no capabilities and won't work at all. Big deal. OTOH, a mount
flag in the vein of suid or dev is mandatory to ensure nobody smuggles in a
capable binary from elsewhere by mounting a floppy...
But AFAIKS capabilities is a systemwide decision. And even if it wasn't,
binding this to the specific filesystem (or mount flags) is extra
complexity, both in-kernel and for the sysadmin. Complexity precisely in
the areas where you don't want any of it. No dice.
