make bzImage does not use bzip2 compression.  It is a "big zImage".  It
changes some things so that the kernel image can be loaded directly into
extended memory.  The reason there is a size limitation on a zImage is
that is is loaded into conventional memory (first 640k), since the
processor is still in real mode while the kernel is loaded.
