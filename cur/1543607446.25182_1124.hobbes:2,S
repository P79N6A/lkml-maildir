Use ip.

iif - using ip then
ip addr add 10.1.1.1/24 dev eth0
creates 10.1.1.1 as a primary address for the 10.1.1.0/24 address space as
defined. Now:
ip addr add 10.1.1.2/32 dev eth0
10.1.1.2 in this case IS NOT a secondary alias because it is _not_ within
the scope of 10.1.1.0/24 by definition (it is in the scope of 10.1.1.2/32
by definition).
Now try:
ip addr add 10.1.1.3/24 dev eth0
and 10.1.1.3 is a secondary alias by definition as it is within the scope
of 10.1.1.0/24
Better yet:
ip addr add 10.1.1.4/25 dev eth0
This defines a third scope on dev eth0 and now:
ip addr add 10.1.1.5/25 dev eth0
defines 10.1.1.5 as a seconday within 10.1.1.0/25
So to summarize we now have:
Three (3) Primary addresses:
	10.1.1.1   for scope 10.1.1.0/24
	10.1.1.2   for scope 10.1.1.2/32
	10.1.1.4   for scope 10.1.1.0/25
Two (2) Secondary addresses:
	10.1.1.3   for scope 10.1.1.0/24
	10.1.1.5   for scope 10.1.1.0/25
Now let us see what the interactions are:
ip addr del 10.1.1.1/24 dev eth0
Will wipe out both 10.1.1.1 and 10.1.1.3
Make sense now?  BTW - don't use ifconfig and coloned addresses (which are
deprecated) as you will merely confuse yourself. Remeber that ifconfig =
InterFace CONFIGure  which has everything to do with Interfaces and very
little to do with IP addresses... ;-}
