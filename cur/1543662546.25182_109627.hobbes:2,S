I have to side with Rusty here - it's really not a module problem.
The module changes only make this a little worse, because they
follow the philosophy that this can't be fixed, so try_module_get
and friends try to implement the right kind of locking for unload
races (but for little else) without tripping over those "unfixable"
bugs.
The good news is that you can start fixing all those bugs right
now, and even without Rusty's consent :-)
