Yes, I agree with the BUG() way (subtle). About the enable_bh_sti() I
don't think it worth to implement it (even if it could save us an __sti())  
because I don't think it's common to call enable_bh with irq disabled
(maybe nobody is doing that just now).
BTW, local_bh_enable()/end_bh_atomic() should be fixed too in the same way
(they are not less important).
