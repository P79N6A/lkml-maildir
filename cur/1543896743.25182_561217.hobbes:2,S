Several of our on-disk filesystems have an ioctl function that already
has indented goto labels.  I don't think it's quite worth churning all
of these (working) filesystems to make a style checker happy.
I think it's worse style to be mixing label indentation in a file as it
is to create new "correct" indentation labels.  That's why I suggested
using context in the file to determine it rather than absolute rules.
