That's not entirely correct.  True enough, they have a very confusing
naming scheme, but that shouldn't set us back too far.
Rage Mobility/M1 = Mach64
M3 = Rage128
M4 = Radeon
For ATI's Mach64 based cards, they chose to let the vendor pick the DAC
that best suited their needs.  While this is good from an economical
perspective, it caused massive support headaches.  Needless to say, ATI
no longer uses this model.  It's not that they refused to publish
drivers, they just screwed themselves out of being able to.
