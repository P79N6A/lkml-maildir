And here's Trond's suggested locks.c fix.

Subject: fs/locks.c: Fix lease_init
Date: Sun, 07 May 2006 23:02:42 -0400
It is insane to be giving lease_init() the task of freeing the lock it is
supposed to initialise, given that the lock is not guaranteed to be
allocated on the stack. This causes lockups in fcntl_setlease().
Problem diagnosed by Daniel Hokka Zakrisson <daniel@hozac.com>
Also fix a slab leak in __setlease() due to an uninitialised return value.
Problem diagnosed by BjÃ¶rn Steinbrink.
