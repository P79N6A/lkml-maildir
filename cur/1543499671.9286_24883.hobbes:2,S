Hello.
I was just wondering, how difficult would it be and would it be
useful if processes below (above) a certain priority only got
to use the harddisk (and other resources, I guess, but none
are as painfully obvious to me at this time) in asynch. mode,
whatever you may mean by that (apart from "gone fishing")? Is
this already being done? Can I look anywhere (theory and/or code)
as to what needs doing? Would priorities of 20+ confuse anything,
or wouldn't non-aware stuff mind (I mean would the whole kernel
have to know about this little secret? :)
Cheers,
    John.
