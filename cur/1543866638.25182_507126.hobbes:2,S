So it was tag 0 that timed out , and according to the CPBs the 
controller indeed believes the command is still outstanding, i.e. we 
didn't lose an interrupt. I'm suspicious of the fact that only one of 
two identical drives produced this error.. some kind of hardware-related 
problem perhaps? 30 seconds is an awfully long time for a drive to take 
to finish a command.
You can also try disabling NCQ without disabling ADMA and see what that 
does:
echo 1 > /sys/block/sdX/device/queue_depth
