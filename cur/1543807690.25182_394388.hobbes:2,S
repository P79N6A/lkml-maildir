Generally you want to move to using a bio instead of a bh. Once you do
that, you can submit > 1 page of io a lot more efficiently than what
ll_rw_block() is doing. submit_bh() is just a 'wrapper' on top of the
real io interface, your explanation of the two doesn't make sense.
generic_make_request() is typically something a low level driver like md
or dm would use to submit a formed bio to a device, it's not something
you'd expect other parts of the kernel to use. If you look at the newer
io parts in the kernel (in fs/ and mm/), you'll see them using
submit_bio() mostly.
