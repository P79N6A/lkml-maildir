The intent is that these code sequences can be patched in place, so they 
need to have a specific abi at the machine-code level.  Some of the 
operations whose Xen implementation clobbers a register have that in 
their definition, on the assumption that 1 temp is enough, and that 
another interface which needs more can organize save/restoring registers 
for itself.
