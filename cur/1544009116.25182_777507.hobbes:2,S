Care to recall why it was added initially and what's changed?
One side effect of removing it is that each device appears on its own
in /sys/devices rather than neatly under /sys/devices/virtio-pci.
(And one side effect of that is that the aforementioned Fedora mkinitrd
kludge stops working which would make me sad :-)
