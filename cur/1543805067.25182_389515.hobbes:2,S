Hello,
   Im having problems with DMA transfer on Linux, for an ADC card. The 
card is AxiomTek AX5621H, and can use DMA channels 1 and 3. I tried both 
the channels, but the DMA transfers are irregular (i.e.) at different 
speeds (which of course is not acceptable, since that application is 
time critical). The device driver (which I wrote) seems to work fine for 
all the other systems I tried it on. But this problem occurs only on one 
particular model of computer (Chino-Laxsons Pentium-4 boards). I tried 
another system with the same configuration, but the same resulted. After 
some time of execution, I get the kernel panic screen, which says the 
CPU context is corrupt. Please help me with this problem, as I need to 
get this driver working somehow on the P4 systems. I tried the Redhat-9 
kernel (2.4.20-8) and the debian kernel too (2.2.20).... gave the same 
results.
Thanks in advance,
Harish.
