it's not that they are being asked to commit to a perpetual support 
contract, it's the fact that they AREN'T being asked to commit to a 
perpetual support contract that makes it more important that the code that 
they are asking to be merged must fit in well with the code and the 
philosphy of the rest of the kernel so that it can be supported well by 
others
if the kernel folks don't agree with the underlying design they may end up 
accepting it for a while, but will rip it out as soon as they get an 
excuse (see devfs for a perfect example)

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
