Yeah, I didn't quite understand why if sg was valid, why dereferencing
*(sg + 1)->page would crap out :/

Hmm I think it's quite readable, but perhaps that's just me :-). The
first is much cleaner, and the last part just reads 'if sg is not set
yet, set to list. otherwise, goto next entry'.

Right, we allocate an sgtable that will hold ->use_sg entries, which
contains request->nr_phys_segments. And that should definitely fit.
Regarding the init of the sglist, that was the revert I was talking
about. We do need that memset() in there, so all those sg entries will
be properly zeroed.

Yep, and that is what Ingo did test as well and it worked. For that
case, now libata is crapping out elsewhere in sg_next().
