Not all machines are PXE capable.  The boot will be generally CDrom or USB
stick.  I wanted to continue to support our machines that are not capable of
booting from either of these (which all of these are not PXE capable)
I might beable to pull this off, I don't know yet.  If it wasn't for all the
modules I have placed in the initrd, I could.  (I could remove one of the
modules and it would fit just fine but I might actually need that module)
