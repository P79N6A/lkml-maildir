The uhci change happened a long time ago :)
And yes, it's a new implementation.
Here's what's in my modules.conf that allows me to run properly for both
2.4 and 2.5:
	alias usb-controller usb-uhci
	alias usb-controller1 usb-ohci
	alias usb-controller2 uhci-hcd
	alias usb-controller3 ohci-hcd
Hope this helps,
