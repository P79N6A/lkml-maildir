you can find a pretty good approximation done by Scott Wood (and Andrey
Panin?) in the ppc/ppc64 portion of the VP patches:
 
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.9-rc1-bk12-S0
basically you only have to zap some of the irq-threading changes such as
calls to redirect_hardirq(), do a s/generic_// and zap the PIC changes
(these are done for redirection too). Scott has tested those changes so
kernel/hardirq.c should work pretty well with ppc/ppc64.
