Just that their performance will suck. People are far less likely to
adopt a product (with an "embrace and extend" side effect) if said
product sucks performance.
Besides, it's better if people send patches to speed up our stack,
rather than having a proprietary product. Patches benefit all
mankind. Products benefit the vendor.
