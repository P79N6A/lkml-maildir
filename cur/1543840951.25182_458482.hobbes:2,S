Good point. RCU users that want to sleep in the read-side
critical sections should be using *srcu APIs* which are separate
from RCU APIs - srcu_read_lock(), srcu_read_unlock(), synchronize_srcu().
I think of CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU as similar to CONFIG_PREEMPT where
preemption is allowed in certain sections in the kernel code.
This makes even more sense once CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT is in
mainline in some form. I should perhaps put in explicit checks
to disallow people from sleeping in RCU read-side
critical sections.

It is still some way from getting there. It needs per-cpu callback
queues for which I am working on a patch. It also needs some
more of Paul's work to reduce read-side overheads. However,
it is reasonably useful in low-end SMP systems for workloads
requiring better scheduling latencies, so I see no reason
not to provide this for CONFIG_PREEMPT users. Besides,
this is one step forward towards merging "crazy" stuff from
-rt :)
Thanks
