This is my personal comment, but the current monitor/mwait
implementation on Prescott is not proper for things like spinlock
because high latency. At this point, the idle loop in the kernel is one
of the intended usage models under that implementation. In the future,
the latency may be lowered, and we'll revisit spinlocks using
monitor/mwait in that case.
