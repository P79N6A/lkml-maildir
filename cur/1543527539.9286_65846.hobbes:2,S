The "migratable socket" is mentioned as an ongoing project of MOSIX at
http://www.mosix.cs.huji.ac.il/
 but it's had that status for awhile,
so it's hard to say.  Their list archive has a post asking about their
migratable socket status as of feb 20, but the archive is 4-5 days behind
reality and it doesn't appear at mail-archive.com yet.
