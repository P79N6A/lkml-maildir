Can you do the same and move compression/encryption to userspace, too?
And actually that "highest level" covers >50% of suspend2 code. That
would be around 7K lines of code removed from kernel if you did the
same, and suspend2 patch would be half the size...

That's userspace problem. Of course we are after low-hanging fruit,
first, but uswsusp design (AND CURRENT KERNEL PARTS) allow you to get
all the fruit with the right userspace.

:-) I like the mirrors idea. Anyway Rafael *did* get code for saving
whole memory at one point, but it looked quite dangerous to me. It was
~300 lines. I'm sure it can be resurrected.

Could you explain? I do not get the checkpointing remark.
