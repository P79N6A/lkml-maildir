Already done: everything that exports file_operations, fb stuff, procfs
stuff. Not yet: TTY, ldisc, I2C, video_device. Hell knows: network
devices.

Sockfs - done. Removing bogus checks still isn't. Devfs races... somewhat
went down, but there's still a lot of them.

Sounds ominously... All of them?

Over existing mountpoint. One always could mount over non-empty directory,
even if some of its children were mountpoints. Anyway, that stuff will be
done - see exchange with AEB.

read/truncate is OK in data part, for metadata rw semaphore looks like a
massive overkill.

? Which locking? flock() or VFS one?
