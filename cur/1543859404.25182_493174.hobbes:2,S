As far as I can tell, the following network devices don't put the 
hardware into D3 on interface down:
3c59x
8139too
acenic
amd8111e
b44
cassini
defxx
dl2k
e100
e1000
epic100
fealnx
forcedeth
hamachi
hp100
ioc3-eth
natsemi
ne2k-pci
ns83820
pcnet32
qla3xxx
rtl8169
rrunner
s2io
saa9730
sis190
sis900
skge
sky2
spider_net
starfire
sundance
sungem
sunhme
tc35815
tlan
via-rhine
yellowfin
while these ones do:
bnx2
tg3
typhoon
via-velocity
tulip is somewhere in between - it puts the chip in a lower power state, 
but not D3. It's possible that some of the other drivers do something 
similar, but nothing leapt out at me.
The situation is more complicated for wireless. Userspace expects to be 
able to get scan results from the card even if the interface is down. In 
that case, I'm pretty sure we need a third state rather than just "up" 
or "down".
