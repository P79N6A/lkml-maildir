Please take a look at comment #50 in Bugzilla 8535:
	
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8535#c50
There have been several reports like this one recently of BUGs
occurring in release_sysfs_dirent() during device unregistration.  
Obviously a use-after-free issue, probably caused by a refcounting 
error.
Is there already a patch available to fix it?
Thanks,
Alan Stern
