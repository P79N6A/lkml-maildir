I actually don't know, but I ran into a very similar problem on a Kt133
based Athlon ages ago (in computer years, anyway.. around december of last
year ;).. I remember it was an ACPI problem that just "went away" with a
later version of ACPI.  That was an MSI (K7 Master, maybe?) motherboard.
Unfortunately, that's all i know.  If you find the answer, please let me
know as well.
