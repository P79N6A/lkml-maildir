Hi
This patch provides a way to specify alternative path to script interpreters.
Current semantics requires to specify complete path to interpreter program in
the first line of script after #!. It is ok as long scripts are used in the 
same system. In different distribution or under different OS specified path is
useless.
It is more elegant to treat word after #! as a name of language and define 
directory containing links to script interpreters. This patch allows to 
use #!awk, and system can be informed how to find a path for it. If interpreter
is not found on a specified path it is searched in directory defined in
/proc/sys/fs/alt-script-path  kernel variable.
This patch also fixes problems with scripts that come from DOS environment 
('\r\n' as line delimiter).
