  I see two problems:
1) You changed interface do dquot_sync() - so you should also
   change DQUOT_SYNC() macro in quotaops.h (rename argument) and
   all callers of DQUOT_SYNC() macro...
2) It seems to me that validate_quotactl() will actually never return
   superblock - instead of 'ret = 0;' there should be 'return sb;'
   and that test 'if (ret)' should be removed....
