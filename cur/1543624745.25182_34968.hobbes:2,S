Ok that would make sense. Next question is do you have an I/O controller
that can use all the 64bit address space on the PCI bus ?
What is happening is that you are using a lot of CPU copying buffers down
into lower memory to transfer to/from disk - as well probably as that
causing a lot of competition for low memory. If your I/O controller can hit
the full 64bit space there are some rather nice test patches that should
completely obliterate the problem.
