Donald, and others involved in tulip driver development:
I am NOT a developer. I am a person running a company using tulip type and 
other network cards in our products.
As such I can not comment on design philosophies.
I CAN make the following statements:
1) When seeking new updates for drivers I keep seeing references to a very 
old .89H version, and then have to seek long and hard to find the patches 
and info to make various cards "work"
2) There are no obvious locations to obtain the updates and patches needed.
As a result ethernet device support is chronically one of the biggest 
support ticket items we run into on Linux machines.
Whatever the cause may be (and I am not the one to judge), it appears that 
_something_ needs to be somewhat differently. It _would_ be nice if someone 
took on the task of ensuring these are more tightly integrated with kernel 
development and distribution. It is a pain to always have to update what 
comes with new distributions. I am not speaking of development kernels, 
just the "even numbered" release version.
What is happening now is problematic.
Whether the reasons Jeff and others state is "it", or something entirely 
different, I simply am not willing to guess. Taking "sides" is unlikely to 
be helpful.
However, I also don't want to see Donalds' efforts go unrecognized.
We _do_ need to move forward to finding a more "streamlined" model for this 
process.
Just $.02 worth from somebody on the "deployment" side of things..
