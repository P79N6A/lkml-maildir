	   It looks like 2.3.6 includes some changes that attempt to
   eliminate the net_cpu_congestion variable, but it is still
   referenced in net/ipv4/ip_forward.c and declared in
   include/linux/netdevice.h.  I suspect that some patch was not fully
   applied.
There are massive changes happening to the networking, it will be
all cleaned up eventually but you need to be patient so we can put the
new framework in place first.
Later,
