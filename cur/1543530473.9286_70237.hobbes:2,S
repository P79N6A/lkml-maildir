I should be subscribed now, decided to join you guys in pain and
misery...
Problem: From the moment I issue an ifconfig eth0 up the Link light
blinks on the switch and no data can be sent or recieved through the
card.
Anyway, I can dual boot back to wintendo98 and the card works fine, its
the late LinkSys 10/100 PCI w/WOL support.  Model, TX100E or something
like that (forget exactly - sorry).  Anyway, I was wondering if there
could be a problem because its sharing interrupts.  My BIOS won't let me
move anything to the IRQs I want to move them to (like the floppy
controller IRQ that goes unused cause I use an LS120 drive).  So the LAN
card is IRQ 9, and so is the SB Live, the TV Tuner, maybe the DVD card
(don't remember what IRQ that was) and I think ACPI shows up on 9 as
well.  If you think this is a possible cause, I can yank cards and try
again, but I don't think its the problem.  Uhmm ... AMD K6/2 450, 128MB,
VIA motherboard (not a broke one), WOL connector not installed (seemed to
have problems powercycling the system constantly with that cable
installed) .. hmm ... card is plugged into an autonegotiating 10/100 full
duplex capable ethernet switch.  No problems under Wintendo98 - telnets
fine to another machine.
Here is a snippett of the logs I get.  Any help anyone could give would
be greatly appreciated.  I don't know what these controll registers do
within the tulip driver.  I could figure it out I suppose, but I know
someone here knows this driver alot better than me and could probably
figure out what this log is showing me alot better than me reading code
for days :
