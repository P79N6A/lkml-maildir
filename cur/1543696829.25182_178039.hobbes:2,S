Subject: [PATCH][BUGFIX] Improper mapping of ACPI-HPET table

Hi,
Early ACPI table parse for HPET tables has a bug, where in it 
does not do proper set_fixmap for ACPI-HPET table. 
This bug was lost in oversight, and was not noticed during 
my testing too, as the ACPI-HPET table on all my test 
systems happened to be in 1st Gig of memory (where __va() 
will do the job). 
Attached patch fixes the bug. Please apply.
Thanks,
-Venkatesh
