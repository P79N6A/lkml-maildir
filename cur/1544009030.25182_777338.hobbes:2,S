Hi Kamezawa,
I definitely agree with the idea of being able to traverse the cgroup
hierarchy without doing a cgroup_lock() and I've included some
comments below. But having said that, maybe there's a simpler
solution?
A while ago I posted some patches that added a per-hierarchy lock
which could be taken to prevent creation or destruction of cgroups in
a given hierarchy; it was lighter-weight than the full cgroup_lock().
Is that sufficient to avoid the deadlock that you mentioned in your
patch description?
The idea of having a short id for each cgroup to save space in the
swap cgroup sounds sensible - but I'm not sure that we need the RCU
support to make the id persist beyond the lifetime of the cgroup
itself.

This comment seems misplaced and possibly unnecessary. Should it be
with the struct cgroup_id definition in cgroup.c?

A lot more commenting would be useful here.

More comments needed about the exact semantics of these fields.

Can you call this cgroup for consistency with other struct cgroup pointers?

How about "stack" for this array?

Rather than having a separate RCU callback for the cgroup_id
structure, how about marking it as "dead" when you unlink the cgroup
from the tree, and freeing it in the cgroup_diput() callback at the
same time the struct cgroup is freed? Or is the issue that you need
the id to persist longer than the cgroup itself, to prevent re-use?

Any reason to not have a separate idr and idr_lock per hierarchy?

There's really no way this can fail?

Can you be more specific here? Clearly calling a function with a
pointer to an object that might have been freed is a bad idea; if
that's all you mean then I don't think it needs to be called out in a
comment.

This code is pretty similar to a big chunk of cgrouproot_setup_idr() -
can they share the common code?

It doesn't seem as though it should be necessary to rcu_dereference()
parent->id - parent can't be going away in this case.

I think this line is supposed to be outside the for() loop.
