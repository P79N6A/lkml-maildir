Actually, this looks like a non-issue from userspace on the IA64 boxen
I can get to. akpm pointed out that this seemed to pass his testing,
and on deeper inspection, IA64 userspace did not find this to be an issue.
Bjorn, could you explain on what toolchains and/or architectures you had
this issue? It sounds serious and/or real enough yet I can't actually
make this happen myself.
Thanks,
Bill
