At least from 2.6.13 on, it will be much easier if you have the PCMCIA
"modules" built into the kernel, as you won't need userspace interaction any
longer (except on old yenta_socket bridges during startup, but that's a
different story). Therefore, I do not see any drawbacks to having the PCMCIA
modules built into the kernel.
