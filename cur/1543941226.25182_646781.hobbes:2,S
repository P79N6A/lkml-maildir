The two lines before:
| usbcore: registered new interface driver snd-usb-audio
| cannot find the slot for index 0 (range 0-0), error: -16
... show that a USB audio device was loaded as the first card (at
index 0), and that the HDA device doesn't load because it tries to go
to the same index.
Use the sound card configuration utility of your distribution to
configure the USB audio device to be the second device, or add the line
  options snd-usb-audio index=1
to /etc/modprobe.conf.
