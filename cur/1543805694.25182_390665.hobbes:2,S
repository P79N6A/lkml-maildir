This is ugly as hell.  If we decided to add it it really needs a major
cleanup, fitting into linux style and removal of unused functionality,
the assembly bits needs to move to an asm/ header, etc.
But to be honest I'd say anything that requires bigints shouldn't go into
the kernel at all.  Could someone explain why they want dsa support in
kernelspace?
