Yowch.  I have the feeling that this'll take our EIO-handling time from
far-too-long to far-too-long*200.
I am still traumatised by my recent ten-minute wait for a dodgy DVD to
become ejectable.
I don't think -stable needs this, personally.

block, I suspect.  My DVD trauma was IDE-induced.  Jens is mulling the
problem - I'd suggest you coordinate with him.
It would be a good thing to fix.
It's moderately hard to test, though.  Easy enough for DVDs and CDs, but
it's harder to take a marker pen to a hard drive.
