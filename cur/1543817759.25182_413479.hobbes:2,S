Don't you see a condition where max_load < avg_load(as mentioned in the
above example) and in this case, code ignores avg_load and imbalance
will aways be the extra normal priority task( coming from
"max_load - busiest_load_per_task") and this normal priority task keeps 
hopping from one cpu to another cpu having normal priority task..

I am looking at ways in fixing all these issues cleanly... I don't have
a clean solution yet...

if the system goes into this state(whatever the reason may be...), how can
the current code detect this and resolve this imbalance... (by reviewing the
code, it shows that imbalance in this particular situation can't be detected...)

Force your test into the above scenario and see how it behaves... if you
simply start new processes, then exec balance will nicely balance...
things go bad only when we go into the described above state..
I can give numerous other examples which fails
c) DP system: if the cpu-0 has two high priority and cpu-1 has one normal
priority task, how can the current code detect this imbalance..
d) 4-way MP system: if the cpu-0 has two high priority tasks, cpu-1 has
one high priority and four normal priority and cpu-2,3 each has one
high priority task.. how does the current code distribute the normal
priority tasks among cpu-1,2,3... (in this case, max_load will always
point to cpu-0 and will never distribute the noraml priority tasks...)
by giving these examples I am just pointing out various corner conditions..
> This (in my opinion) is what you are seeing.
Simple review of the current code is showing all these problems... when you
start new tasks, all will be well because of fork/exec balance... but
during run time, if the system goes to a particular state, current imbalance
code behaves poorly in the presence of high priority tasks...
