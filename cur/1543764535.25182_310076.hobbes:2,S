I just tested this (I wanted to be sure you didn't have some 47GHz
LiHe cooled Xeon or something).
On my somewhat slowish machine[1] (by today's standards anyhow) I can
stat a checked out tree (ie. the source files and not SCM files) in
about 0.10s it seems and 0.26s for an entire tree with BK files in it.

Actually, I could probably make this *much* still faster with a
caveat.  Given that my editor when I write a file will write a
temporary file and rename it, for files in directories where nlink==2
I can check chat first and skip the stat of the individual files.
And I guess if I was bored I could have my editor or some daemon
sitting in the background intelligently using dnotify to have this
information on-hand more or less instantly.  For this purpose though
that seems like a lot of effort for no real gain right now.

Well, I do like to do "bk sfiles -x" fairly often.  But then again I
can stat dirs and compare against a cache to make that fast too.
