Hello All,
I plan to write the PCI driver based on âPCI driver
modelâ.  
I understand that I have to populate the pci_driver
and pci_device_id structures with the required driver
routines and device information for dyanamic loading
of device. 
But I could not understand how the user level
application can open the device and communicate with
the driver through ioctls.  I dont   know how I can
populate the ioctl routine in pci driver like
file_operations structure in char driver.
Please le me know the pointers regarding this. 
Thanks,
Sundar Raj
