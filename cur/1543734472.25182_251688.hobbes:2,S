And this is the reason that cards tend to do 2d and 3d through the same 
command queue, and often the same hardware at the backend - there's no need on 
such hardware to quiesce between acclerated 2d and 3d commands.
Of course, if either user ends up wanting to touch the framebuffer directly, 
they will have to flush the queue & wait for quiescence.  There's nothing 
particularly 2D or 3D about this - they both have fallbacks, and they're both 
faster if fallbacks can be avoided.
