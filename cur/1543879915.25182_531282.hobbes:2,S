Or better just pass argument directly.  We really
should only pass down the the dentry and the
intent to the filesystem.  The filesystem has
not business looking at mnt in the operations,
and the relevant bits of flags (mostly whether it's
O_EXCLUSIVE) should be stored in the intent, because
that's the only way it should be used.
Doing it that way also allows to fix some braindead calling conventions
like this one:

Or this one.

or this one.
etc..
