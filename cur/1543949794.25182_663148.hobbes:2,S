Nope, its a userspace driver problem.. we have not released 
non-experimental code for that chipset, so its not surprising it fails 
when the kernel code gets run, but the fix most likely is in userspace not 
in the kernel.
I could disable the userspace DRI code but then where would I find my 
testers .. if he reads his Xorg log it says DRI is experimental on rs690 
and not to come crying..
this is the problem with adding new chipsets, I either wait for 6 months 
for all the bugs to get kicked out so nobody wins, or I push it upstream 
so most people win, I could back this out of the kernel, but experimental 
userspace code isn't  a reason for this..
Dave.
