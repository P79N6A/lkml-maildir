Is this last comment specific to the Abit BP6 or the 3c509, or is it a
general warning relating to any PCI hardware?
The reason I ask is that I have a system with three PCI Ethernet
cards, all RealTek 8259's using the ne2k-pci driver, and the BIOS for
some reason has put all three on IRQ 9, leaving IRQ's 10 and 11 unused
as far as I can tell.
Also, is this behaviour to be expected?
Best wishes from Riley.
