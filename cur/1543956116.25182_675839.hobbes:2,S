Actually, I think kmemcheck should support SMP even more than mmiotrace.
Mmiotrace is just a reverse engineering tool for hardware drivers, but
kmemcheck as a debugging tool could be valuable specifically on SMP,
think about racing CPUs using and initializing memory. Dropping to UP
might hide those problems.

To be honest, I don't know how easy or difficult it is. If there was a
general decoding facility, it shouldn't be that hard to use, if someone
else makes the facility for us ;-)
Could all relevant instructions be represented as three-address-code or
in some other simple form?
This seems to require some experimenting with code.
