How about ERR_PTR() and IS_ERR()? Same idea as the cast-1-to-pointer method,
but marginally nicer. Even better, any chance of an API change so you can
err = register_sysctl_table(mytable, 0, &my_sysctl);
?
I've not looked into the code, so I don't know what it is that
register_sysctl_table returns, but is it the sort of thing that could be
a pointer to static dummy struct when the main code is disabled?
