The entire call to iget4() is protected by the BKL in all relevant
instances. As long as we don't sleep between find_inode() and
nfs_fill_inode(), we're safe.
In fact the BKL protection is needed also for another reason: we don't
actually initialize the inode in the I_LOCK-protected read_inode() but
instead rely on the caller of iget4 to do it for us. The reason is
that one we would need to pass the struct nfs_fattr to read_inode()
and this wasn't possible until the ReiserFS people introduced
read_inode2().
