Isn't there a way to mark it "warning! warning! dangerous!" ?
Anyway: I think 100 RT priorities is way overkill - and slowing things
down by making the scheduler checking more empty slots in the runqueue.
Default ought to be 10. In practise it will be very hard to have
a task at the lower RT priority behaving real-time with 99 higher
priority tasks around. I find it hard to believe that somebody has an RT
app needing more than 10 priorities and can't do with RR or FIFO
scheduling within a fewer number of prorities.
