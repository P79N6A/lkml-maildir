I just spent a while looking at the code. The joystick driver doesn't
need to exist. Instead the snd_intel8x0_probe() routine could have a
loop that does pci_get_subsys() over the ID's in
snd_intel8x0_joystick_ids[]. When it finds one, use the config space
to enable the joystick/midiports. You can locate the ports since
pci_get_subsys() returns the pci_dev* for the bridge device.  Save the
pci_dev* and set the ports back in snd_intel8x0_remove(). Don't forget
to pci_put() the bridge device.
This isn't a device driver for the bridge, we just want to locate it
and flip some bits. Later on if a driver for the bridge get written it
should support an API for setting these bits and the search loop can
be removed.
All of these devices are listed as Intel LPC bridges:
2410, 2420, 2440, 244c, 2450, 2480, 2484, 24c0, 24cc, 24d0, 24dc,
25a1, 2640, 2641, 2642
I have a 24D0 which isn't in the driver list, this is probably why
MIDI doesn't work on my system.
