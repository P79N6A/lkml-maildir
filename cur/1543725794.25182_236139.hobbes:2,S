p4-clockmod is not really a cpufreq driver: it does not change the
frequency. The only function is to have 'idle-cycles' to cool down the
processor during intensive CPU programs: this is what the processor
does when it gets too hot.
The speedstep driver _does_ change the frequency (and/or voltage) and
gives other advantages like less power consumption.
So use speedstep.
