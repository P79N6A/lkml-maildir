Arjan,
the following patch was written by Manfred Spraul to fix your highmem
bug.  I haven't had a chance to go over it, but I would like it if you
could test it.  It can't hurt.  Patch it on top of the preempt patch and
enable CONFIG_PREEMPT, CONFIG_HIGHMEM, and CONFIG_HIGHMEM_DEBUG.
let me know what happens...any relevant messages, etc. please pass
along. if it does work, id be curious if they are any slowdowns
