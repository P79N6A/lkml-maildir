in theory that's true.  however, i also tried a pair of 10 (or 12) bit
random tables x-ored together without shifting, and the result wasn't much
better.  i think you can get away with this if your input data allows it.
but again, using small random tables is to be desired.  can you think of a
way to make a random table-driven hash function work with an absolute
minimum amount of memory references?
