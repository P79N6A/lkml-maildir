	Thank you for the information.
	I will give it some thought and see if I can come up
	with something that will fit both bills...
	The problem is that the disks that I have are
	very wide-spread, I would imagine. Compaq is shipping
	them in their newer machines, so some compromise has
	to be arrived at.
	I will look into the matter further.
	Thanks again.
	cheers, 
	eamb
