symetry for what?  Ah, unwinding from an error condition, that makes
sense.
Is there some reason you aren't using the "real" PCI driver api here and
registering a pci driver for these devices?  That would take the whole
"loop over all pci devices" logic out of the code entirely.

So something like the patch below would be fine?
