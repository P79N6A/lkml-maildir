You are mixing oranges (protocols) and apples (implementations and APIs)
here.
The layer that is expected to provide reliable end to end communication is
layer 4 (transport layer). TCP, at least in theory, is as good as OSI
transport in providing reliable end to end communication.

Layers above layer 4 provide additionnal services for applications but
they assume that layer 4 is reliable. In other words, a broken transport
layer breaks all layers above it and thus the applications.
In fact, when you build your application above layer 4 and need services
normally provided by upper OSI layers, you have to implement equivalent
services in your application, using layered protocols or not.

That's API semantic issue, not protocol issue.
