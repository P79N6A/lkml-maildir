r39xx (sorry, I misspelled it) is MIPS platform, originally running
windows CE. Only bootloader that works for me is pbsdboot (i.e. BSD
bootloader), and I'm not able to even compile it (it requires
microsoft tools to compile). Agreed that bootloader should do that,
but bootloader is very hard to touch.
