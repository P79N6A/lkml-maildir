More generally, how about automatically discarding VMAs and rmap
chains when pages become mlocked, and not creating those structures in
the first place when mapping with MAP_LOCKED?
The idea is that adjacent locked regions would be mergable into a
single VMA, looking a lot like the present non-linear mapping, and
with no need for rmap chains.
Because mlock is reversible, you'd need the capability to reconsitute
individual VMAs from ptes when unlocking a region.
