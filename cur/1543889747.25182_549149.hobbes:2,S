Many watchdogs can be hooked up to a non-maskable interrupt (NMI) that
cannot be disabled or preempted.  You get a stack dump even for drastic
bugs:  ISR lock up, timer misconfiguration, level-sensitive interrupt
line stuck asserted, and so forth.  Getting that information by other
means can be painful and/or expensive.
The Blackfin chip in the original message appears to support watchdog
NMI.
