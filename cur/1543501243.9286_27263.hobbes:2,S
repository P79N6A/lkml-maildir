Nope, I didn't say or assume that. I've already pointed out that you
can provide new command-line utilities or add switches to existing
utilities that perform some kind of remapping for you.
I do assert that most developers will want the raw interface, but that
doesn't mean the cooked interface can only exist in a GUI.

Definately not! It's a per-user (per-process) policy!
It's obvious why the kernel or libc should not cook albods: backups.
