You don't use the modules.alias file.  You simply "modprobe vio:xyz^abc"
and modprobe reads modules.alias if necessary (the user can also insert
aliases in the modprobe.conf file, for example).  Note that fnmatch is
used, so you can actually use ? and * in your generated aliases.

Spaces are probably a bad idea, yes.  ^ is a little odd, but probably
not a bad choice.  You could even use a full: "vio:name:%s:compat:%s" if
you wanted to.
