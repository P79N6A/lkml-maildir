Hi,
I always ran into a very similar problem using 3com cards in a dual-boot
environment with Windows. The solution which I discovered; which may or may
not apply here; is that the card retains some kind of settings information
from the os you are rebooting from, so when you reboot right into the next
os (without completely powering down first) the incorrect settings are
retained, effectively preventing or severely hindering the nic from
operating correctly. You might check if you experience the problem when you
completely power down between reboots.
Again, this may not apply here, but I thought it was worth mentioning since
this plagued me for a long while before I realized the obvious solution.
Regards,

Subject: 2.2.17 3Com bug
Hello,
I ran RedHat 6.2 and tried all sorts of kernels.. no problem at all.
I ran kernel 2.2.17 and everytime MS-Windows has booted(I run a dual-boot
sys) my networkcard (eth0=dhcp=3c59x.o) doesn't want to connect to the
internet. First I thought this was my isp his fault or my redhat was
broken. But this problem stayed.
Now, I run Debian 2.2 kernel 2.2.17 and I have the same problem. When
Windows has booted and I want to get back into linux, I have to wait half
an hour until my networkcard works again.
Now, I haven't had this problem before with older kernels, not even with
2.4.0-testx
I don't know what to about this, maybe it's not a bug at all but I don't
trust it.
Summary:
problem: no dhcp-lease at boot(have to wait almos half an hour)
module:  3c59x
Thanks for reading my mail
Yours sincerely
hdcool
