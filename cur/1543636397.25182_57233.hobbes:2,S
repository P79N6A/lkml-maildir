Did your Buslogic patch ever get included? I'm still
getting errors compiling 2.5.x as of .26 last night:
BusLogic.c:32: #error Please convert me to Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt
BusLogic.c: In function `BusLogic_DetectHostAdapter':
BusLogic.c:2841: warning: long unsigned int format, BusLogic_IO_Address_T arg (arg 2)
BusLogic.c: In function `BusLogic_QueueCommand':
BusLogic.c:3415: structure has no member named `address'
BusLogic.c: In function `BusLogic_BIOSDiskParameters':
BusLogic.c:4141: warning: implicit declaration of function `scsi_bios_ptable'
BusLogic.c:4141: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast
make[2]: *** [BusLogic.o] Error 1
Given that your patch was against .24, I would guess
it should be "relatively" safe against a .26 since it's
only driver code that everyone else seems to be ignoring.
