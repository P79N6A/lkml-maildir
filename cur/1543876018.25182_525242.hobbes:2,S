postdates the interface it's describing by at *least* two years. Which
was the point of my mail that you conveniently ignored - retroactively
deciding which parts of the interface you export to userspace shouldn't be
used falls way short of best practices.

It appears to... the point was that (as far as the code is concerned)
it's a silent break. Of course, code that expects the 'current' layout
will then break when this new change is made, unless you add
CONFIG_SYSFS_SLIGHTLY_LESS_DEPRECATED?
