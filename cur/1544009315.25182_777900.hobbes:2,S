I hope it is not another limitation for the early userspace? :)
I worked with systems where init made everything. Not showing that as an
example of particulary good design, but still there may be situations
when userspace code does something, which kernel is not ready for. And
it is a kernel problem that it is not ready for some usespace behaviour.
Btw, modprobe can not print error message to the console, that's the
rule ;)
