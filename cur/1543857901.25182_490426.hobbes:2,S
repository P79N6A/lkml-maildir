That would be the existing serial console interface. For things like USB
serial you are probably out of luck. At the moment we have a single
"console" attached to a specific serial console interface. The code is
almost all there for allowing other parties to create new synchronous
serial logging devices by opening open as the console driver does.

You have a high priority character output function which jumps existing
data. Not all hardware implements this, and some of the modern hardware
in particular simply doesn't physically support such behaviour. Also if
you are the sole user of the port you *know* nobody else will be queuing
data to it anyway.

The entire tty side locking, scheduling and design is based upon the idea
that input processing is deferred. Otherwise you get long chains of
recursion from the worst cases.
