In my case, I was able to read data from hda while the cdrom
on hdd was trying to recover data from a scratched disk.
Reading data from hdc (shared cable with the CDROM), on the
other hand, was VERY slow.
I have an 82371AB PIIX4 ide interface (dual IDE chipset),
It's part of a 440BX chipset board.
If accessing on one IDE interface (C/D) causes the other (A/B) to lockup,
I'd guess you've got especially cheap hardware on your box.
