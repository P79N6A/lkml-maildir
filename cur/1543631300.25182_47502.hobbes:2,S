The catastrophic failures are still happening, in fact, the last
lse-tech conference call a week or two ago was dedicated at least in
part to them. The number of different ways in which these failures
occur is large, so it's taking a while for the iterations of whack-a-mole
game to converge to kernel stability. Andrea has probably been doing the
most visible stuff on this front with the recent bh/inode exhaustion
patches, with due credit to akpm as well for the unconditional bh
stripping patch.
Cheers,
