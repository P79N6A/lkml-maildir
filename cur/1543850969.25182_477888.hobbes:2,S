The original code (as posted to this list) and as is currently maintained
by me, does _not_ wait 30 seconds to start error recovery of the timed
out command when the task is requested to be aborted by REQ_TASK_ABORT.
I don't know how or why someone changed the code as there is a "black out
perdiod" when the code was being "worked on" by bottomley and gang outside
of git control.
SCSI core already allows you to do what you're trying to do here going
around your elbow... in a more straightforward way, and more elegantly.
Study the following threads:

I've listed them in chronological order so that you can see
the "evolution" of opinion-changing.

This new task flag is neither necessary nor needed.

It is good that it keeps you busy.  Sadly it has already been implemented.
Good luck!
