You are naming the exceptions. A system is OK to reboot for the
following occasions:
- changes in the hardware
  If you don't have a true HA-solution, replacing a cpu-board is considered
  severe enough. - Maybe even adding some ethernet cards, or harddisk.
  But if you *have* a HA-solution, these are NOT considered to be a reason
  for a reboot.
  
- basic changes in the systems internals (as changes in the /etc/hosts)
  (You may even change this in singleusermode...)
  Going into singleusermode is not considered a reboot, since the systems
  uptime keeps growing...
  I don't consider a upgrade of any piece of software that does not
  belong directly to the kernel as being a system internal. I.E. an
  upgrade of an office-package should be no reason at all to reboot
  the system. - In fact, where I work, we replaced (updated) the
  complete Applixware-package overnight on all our customers workstations.
  - Hasslefree, without any complains and not a single reboot!
- after a severe crash: Filesystemschecks - But you only need to go into
  singleusermode for that! (Same goes for chancges in the /etc/hosts)
When you leave these rare and necessary occasions away, what is left?
Exact the situations, where NT falls over it's own bootstraps.

Of course! - But only after a severe system crash. - Which I consider to be 
an acceptable reason to make an fsck. ;-)
As long as you can manage to keep your system free of memmory leaks, zombies
and system crashes, there is no dire need for a fsck or reboot at all.

Why should I?
Why should I expect less from NT than from Solaris, when it's *THAT* great,
as M$ tries to suggest everybody and his uncle?
I'm sitting here with my real life experience and I'm still awaiting
M$ to come even a tiny bit closer to what I call a stable (which I call
*PROFESSIONAL*) system. - They don't get it. They haven't got it for years
now. - Even Linux was completely developed during the time M$ exists, so
M$ has a major advantage over Linux in this case. - Is NT more stable? - No.
Has it more features? - No. - Is it cheaper? - No. - Does it perform better?
- In most cases: No.
So why should I use NT?
Neutral analysts believe that NT contains 2.3 million bugs. *GULP*
 And now comes Windows 2000 (aka NT 5.0) - guess how many bugs...
The analysts guess it will be around 5 million bugs.
I won't dare say Linux is flawless, but I consider it to have a vast amount
of bugs less than 5 millions...
Just my 0.02 $
Best regards,
