yes, i did.  another thing that makes it pretty obvious is the cpu time reported by ps.  kupdated cpu time will stay 0:00 until i run into the condition i described.  then kupdated cpu time will jump as much as 0:45.
but i have fixed the issue by using the correct ide driver.  though, someone may want to look into this anyway...dunno..
