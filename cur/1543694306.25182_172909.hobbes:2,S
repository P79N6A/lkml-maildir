It can't be cmov emulation since neither 486 or Pentia have cmov, but
one of the following (differences between 386 and 486):
- cmpxchg: not used by UP kernels AFAICT, used by threading libraries,
  but maybe it's infrequent enough that it can be emulated
- xadd: can't tell whether it's used, could be emulated in any case
  since it looks so rare that you'll have to write specific code
  to exercise the emulator ;-)
- bswap: heavily used by network code at least, both applications and 
  kernel (ntohl/htonl). Emulation would probably be too expensive.
- invlpg: kernel only, easy to test and flush the whole TLB instead,
  perhaps even by boot-time patching of the code to minimize size.
  (I have no ideas of the number of occurences in an average kernel
  but it should be rather small).
- invd/wbinvd: only listed here for completeness :-)
The other problem of the 386 is that it has a fundamental MMU flaw:
no write protection on kernel mode accesses to user space, which makes 
put_user() intrinsically racy on a 386 and way more bloated when it is
inlined (access_ok has to call a function which searches the VMA tree).
