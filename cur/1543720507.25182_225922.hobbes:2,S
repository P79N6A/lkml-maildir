Aha, so you have never actually bothered to read the damn things.  Two words:
ioctl code.
Another thing: two weeks had been enough to practically eliminate noise in
net/*, sound/*, large parts of drivers/*.  The only real difficulty I've
noticed was one with holding the breakfast down while reading some of more...
colourful code.
And one more: counting drivers that do not have a single __user in them
is meaningless for so many reasons it's not even funny.
Now would it be too much to ask the esteemed sir to piss off and not return
until sir acquires a modicum of clue?
