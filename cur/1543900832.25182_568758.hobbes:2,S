free ram is useually a pretty small number of pages (unless you free up 
ram before suspend). avoiding the ram reserved for the new kernel should 
be pretty simple (actually, it doesn't hurt much to save that ram, it just 
hurts if you try to restore it)

Ok, now we need a data channel from the old kernel to the hibernate 
kernel, to the restore kernel. and the messier the memory layout the 
larger this data channel needs to be (hmm, what's the status on the memory 
defrag patches being proposed?) if this list can be made small enough it 
would work to just have the old kernel put the data in a known location in 
ram, and let the other two parts find it (in ram for the hibernate kernel, 
in the hibernate image for the wakeup kernel). how do the existing 
hibernate processes store this? since people are complaining about the 
amount of ram that a kexec kernel would take up I'm assuiming it's 
somethingmore complex then just a bitmap of all possible pages.
most of the conversation so far has been around the process of makeing the 
snapshot and storing it. what are the processes and tools available to 
restore images?
