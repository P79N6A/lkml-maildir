But however you phrase it, that's effectively what it is. "Does your 
device work?" just makes users wonder why the damn computer doesn't know 
already. "This option may prevent your device from working. Click here 
to switch it off" results in them wondering why it was switched on in 
the first place. Many of our users aren't technical - they don't care 
about saving 200mW, they just care about their printer working when they 
plug it in.
And, frankly, if I got a requestor like that every time I plugged in a 
new USB device I'd be fairly unhappy.

Because I don't believe we'll ever identify every device that gets 
broken, and so as a result I think it's better to disable the 
functionality by default for anything that might be broken.

Users understand CDs. They don't understand runtime power management.

I also handle a lot of the desktop/kernel integration.

"Usbfs files can't handle Access Control Lists (ACL), which are the 
default way to grant access to USB devices for untrusted users of a 
desktop system. The usbfs functionality is replaced by real device-nodes 
managed by udev. These nodes live in /dev/bus/usb and are used by 
libusb."

It can be, but I'd prefer to have userspace enable functionality than 
have the kernel break things.
