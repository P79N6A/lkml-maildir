Just bought an "HP Multimedia Keyboard Hub" (USB).
Using with RedHat 7.2, kernels 2.4.9-81 and also
various 2.4.19-pre.
Immediately after boot the keyboard does not work.
I see some events from the knob and also from
some extra buttons but not from the keyboard itself
(some produce "unknown scancode" errors. That's
a different topic). The keyboard leds turn on and off
responding to pressing caps-lock etc on the PS/2
keyboard.
After "rmmod hid" and "modprobe hid" The usb
keyboard works just fine - until I disconnect/reconnect
it or until the next reboot.
The hub function on they keyboard works OK.
The keyboard works with other OS, or with the bios
(after I enabled "USB Legasy Support").
Any suggestions/hints?
I'm also looking for programs o test the HID event
interface (evtest) as suggested in the docs, It is not in
the suggested web page.
Thanks,
-- Itai
