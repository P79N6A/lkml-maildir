Tested and working here on VER_11.  I don't have a VER_12, so I left that as-is.
If you want to fix that as well, just move the new "break;" down one line.
The rest of the broken commit works fine without the new call
to rtl8168b_hw_phy_config(ioaddr).
It's been weeks now, so please FIX it now.
Thanks.
