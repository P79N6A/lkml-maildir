If we are doing global rename patches, could we make one of the
deliverables a sed or perl script that exactly produces the patch,
suitable for running one-time on out-of-kernel trees?  Add the script
in the kernel scripts directory.
It is usually too easy to produce a nearly correct script, and too
difficult to produce an exactly right one, for all but serious sed or
perl regex hackers.
