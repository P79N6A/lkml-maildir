Ok, I see it in -mm now, and it does seem to be nicer code, I'll
try it out on parisc64.

I agree, I'm really just trying to shepard this home so we don't have
to maintain it out of tree. I'm not overly attached to the code, if
I can make parisc64 work with your compat signal bits, I'll be
just as happy.
The one thing from this patchset I'd like to keep is the is_compat_task()
as it does provide nice cleanups 
Cheers, Kyle
