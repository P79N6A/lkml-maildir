actually, I did the rootfstype thing (and /proc/config but different
from Peter's) too, ages ago :)
http://www.ocston.org/~tigran/patches/rootfs-2.3.29-p1.patch
and it is nicer to call it rootfs than rootfstype, because:
a) compatible with SVR4
b) most people are running hacked versions of LILO shipped with major
distributions (Red Hat, SuSE etc) which have a limit of 79 bytes per
command line. One can overcome this limit with my BCP thing but only a
handful of people actually use it.
Regards,
Tigran
