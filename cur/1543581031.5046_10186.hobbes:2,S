Ok thank you for your help.
I've followed your first advice. My solution was ok on my target (ppc and x86) but was not a good solution.
I'm very interesting to know why it's bad to restore flags in a sub-function. I imagine it should be due to an optimisation in the restore function.
Thank you,
Christophe Barbé
