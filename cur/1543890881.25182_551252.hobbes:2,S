Funnily enough I have just today with an app I have which uses 1.2GB
of textures :-)
we are currently using GFP_DMA32 in the TTM allocator code, however
what I really want on x86 non-PAE is GFP_HIGHMEM (as DMA32 does
nothing) however on x86-PAE I don't want that I want a real GFP_DMA32,
and on x86-64 I want the current GFP_DMA32,
Therein lies my problems, the API sucks, but I suppose the DRM TTM is
a special use case (AGP is the same) and I'll accept the fact that can
just make it my own problem, my current solution would be to screw PAE
machines giving them 1GB only and let non-PAE access all 4GB.
Dave.
