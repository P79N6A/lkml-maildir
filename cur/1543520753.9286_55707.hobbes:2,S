when you say "plug-in", do you mean to make it easy to plug-in per-cpu code
at compile time, (eg config choice) or boot-time?
I'd love to see the latter, as i tend to use one kernel build across
multiple machines (P54C, K6, K6-III). So ideally i'd like:
1. at compile time i have a choice something like
	include optimised memcpy routines for:
		O P5
		O MMX only
		O MMX + 3DNow
		O Pentium III SSI
		O Athlon
and i'd just select all the machines that i need. Then at boot kernel could
select appropriate memcpy method (is this possible though?).
regards,
paul jakma.
