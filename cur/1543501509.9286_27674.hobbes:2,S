Broadcast it (MAC-addr all ones) to a "special" port. To send it out,
you need a bare bones, no frills, interruptless, stripped down driver
(reset ethernet board, put packet in buffer, send it, die).
Actually I think, that sending the oops out over the network (as a
compile option, of course) is a nice idea. Maybe I will toy with this
sometime this weekend (don't hold your breath, though :-)
