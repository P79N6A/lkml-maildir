  I have just started looking at Linux code. So i am not sure how this fits into
  the Linux context in terms of the Linux code/calls. But the following idea might help.
  If your sure of the address being read from the ISR.
   a) Lock that user address into memory.
   b) Map this user page(s) into the kernel address space.
  As part of ISR, you can read the data now from this kernel address. In this case you 
  don't have to worry about if the process is currently running or not. 
 thanks,
 Rama.
