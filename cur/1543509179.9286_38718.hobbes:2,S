I've seen similar symptoms on 2.2.9, where ls tels me that some file
vanishes (though other files in the directory exist) yet I can still
open it with vi, emacs, whatever.
However, I cannot remove these phantom files, or replace them. I manage
to recreate them by copying them into a different file and moving that
file into place.
Weird.
