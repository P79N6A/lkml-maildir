Well I guess it's my fault to some extent with the subject line.  I
don't really care about /etc/mtab so much except that I'd like it to
be consistent if it is going to be there.  I'd rather it do one of two
things.  Show me my current process's namespace accurately or just the
stuff that's global to all namespaces.  Right now it's kind of in
between.
Also since when I type "mount" it just spits out what's in "mtab" it
seems like that should be made more accurate... not /proc/self/mounts.
(it looks like you can just edit the file and stick whatever you want
in there...  I just stuck the line:
 "blah blah blah"
in there and got:
"blah on blah type blah ()"
 from "mount" with no arguments)

It's actually a bit more like "protected" I suppose [in an OO
inheritance sense].  If I use clone with the right flags my new
process has a namespace that doesn't get reflected in the other
process's.  Sure I still inherit the parent's namespace, but I'm free
to bind to my hearts content in ways that other processes will not see
[unless they are children of the currently clone'd process].
Even in this "protected" namespace other processes can clearly see
what I'm doing via /etc/mtab.  It seems there will always be a way to
sniff out this information though since all the files of the form
/proc/<pid>/mounts are read accessible by everyone.
