yes, in the example above i only outlined that the problem is real and 
not limited to Aunt Tillie's.

circular dependencies are nicely detected, warned about and worked 
around by the Kconfig system. I fixed one such bug recently. I have to 
say the Kconfig code has improved very significantly during the past few 
years and i dont want any of what i'm writing to be understood as a 
criticism. It's more in the direction of: 'ok, things are pretty nice 
and the config tree works currently, now lets make it even cleaner'.

the solution is i think two-fold and goes along the lines i outlined in 
the previous mail:
 - make dependencies as tree-alike as possible
note that the MTD problem was caused by those drivers not being part of 
a clean tree.
But even with a 100% clean tree structure there's a legitimate desire to 
select modules several layers down from the current 'leaf' nodes of the 
config tree:
 - provide a tool mode (not a Kconfig language feature) to navigate the
   complete tree of features (including currently disabled ones) and
   enable the selection of components (by automatically selecting all
   dependent features).
