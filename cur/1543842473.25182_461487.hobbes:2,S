>> Telnet is something very different.
Even though all four geometric figures in IQ tests have something in comment
(they're triangular for example), they are different to a certain degree that
one falls apart. Any IQ test has some sort of that.
So, which one does not belong in the group?
( ) pine
( ) mutt
( ) Thunderbird
( ) telnet
That was my point.
> You can send patches using telnet
You can also send patches using netcat, you might even be able to use bash
itself! It is not very friendly though, esp. when it comes to attachments or
MIME encoding.
