Hi Jan,
This issue was fixed in a generic way in the patch set that is in the 
-mm tree.  Had you tried your test case in the current -mm tree?
The problem you mentioned was fixed by saving and restoring the preempt 
count as a part of the fault handling from the kgdb core and not in the 
arch specific portion.
Jason.
