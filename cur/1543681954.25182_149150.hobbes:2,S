Subject: [PATCH resend] BadRAM for 2.6.0-test1*
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Previous patch was currupted somehow (I haven't been having 
much luck lately with Web based mailers) so here it is again.
I have compressed it so that it will perhaps be treated more carefully by the mailer :-/
It applies ok to all 2.6.0-test1 based kernels I have tested.
