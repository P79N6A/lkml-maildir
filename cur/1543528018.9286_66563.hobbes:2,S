Hi,
I've been out of town for a week, and I missed the 2.3.46 and 2.3.47.
I just tried 2.3.48.
I'm happy that my changes (well, not really mine but I had the basic
understandings of what was need) got into the kernel. I don't know who
did this, but I thank him (or her).
Most of the problems are solved, but some others are appearing.
Here are the problems I encounter:
- w/ /proc filesystem
fs/proc/root.c: proc_root_ppc_htab undeclared
 This seems to be a problem relative to all PPCs
- w/ Builtin Powermac IDE
drivers/block/ide-dma.c: pci_dev doesn't exist in structure
 Heh, yeah, ide-dma is really broken
- arch/ppc/kernel/setup.c
        in ppc_generic_ide_fix_driveid, parse error before i
a ";" is missing lines 736, 738, 741
 Some easy to track down bugs :P

while linking vmlinux
        in function vt_ioctl, undefined
                console_getmode
                console_setmode
                console_setcmap
                console_powermode
I don't understand this one...
