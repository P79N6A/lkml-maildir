OK, I know this isn't really a kernel issue, so you may stop 
reading here.
Anyhow, if you're still reading: I don't mean to start any 
debates or anything; I'm just curious about some statistics. Are 
you advocates of the OSI or the FSF (ie., do you write/use open 
source software for the sake of technology or freedom)? 
Personally, I'm leaning more towards the FSF direction.
Thank you!
