no, i asked something else.
i'm asking the following thing. dev->quota, as i read the patch now, can
cause extra calls to ->poll() even though the RX ring of that particular
device is empty and the driver has indicated it's done processing RX
packets. (i'm now assuming that the extra-polling-for-a-jiffy line in the
current patch is removed - that one is a showstopper to begin with.) Is
this claim of mine correct?
