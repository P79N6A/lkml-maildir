Have you found a system where this really improves behavior or is it 
just theoretical?
There _is_ a theoretical reason for running the handoff routines even 
when the corresponding driver isn't configured.  Namely, at startup the 
controller will be in some undetermined state as a result of usage by 
the firmware.  Resetting it to a known idle state is a good idea.
Bear in mind that on some systems, not performing the handoff has
caused interrupt storms during startup.
