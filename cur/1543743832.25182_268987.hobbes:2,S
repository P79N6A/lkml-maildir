Hello,
just an thought on cron, not very kernel related:
In article <200411070058_MC3-1-8E27-AAEF@compuserve.com> you wrote:

if you have a cron job which is executed very often cron will spawn a new
child everytime the deadline is reached. if the client is stuck for some
reason (ie. uninterruptiple sleep while accessing a broken ressource) it
will soon fill up your systems.
Personally thats why I prefer a cron-like system, which is configured with
maximum concurrency (or always serialize the jobs for a given type). This
has problems with handing jobs, but it is generally more stable for the
system.
Greetings
Bernd
