Ok, I guess that will fix the sniffing issues and any user-space 
bridging type applications.
Currently, VLAN devices offer the ability to 'reorder' the header and 
explicitly remove the VLAN
header.  I assume we keep this feature and have the AF_PACKET logic 
check the device
flags to see if it should insert the VLAN header for hw-accel vlans?
Either way, if we sniff the underlying device, we should always get the 
VLAN header.
What about drivers and filtering VLANs?  It seems there is still a 
difference between software
vlans and hw-accel in this case.
Thanks,
Ben
