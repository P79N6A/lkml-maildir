This is a problem with the 2.2.14 locking. You need to manually start
the 'lockd' daemon using the 'rpc.lockd' program provided in the
nfs-utils package (ex-knfsd). If you don't already have this program,
you can find a copy of nfs-utils at
   
ftp://ftp.linuxnfs.sourceforge.org/pub/nfs
My guess is that is the source of your problem. Please try this before
you attempt any further debugging...

echo '65535' >/proc/sys/sunrpc/rpc_debug
will turn on the full RPC debugging code. That will usually give
syslogd a nasty turn though, since the volume of info is extremely
large. I'd therefore initially start by doing this only when the hang
occurs (after stopping all other NFS + locking activity from other
processes).

Just start tcpdump when the hang occurs as per above:
   tcpdump -vvv -s 256
