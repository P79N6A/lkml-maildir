It's not necessary - I probably should have omitted it along with the 
#define ADBREQ_RAW 0 which I added to arch/m68k/mac/misc.c
The 'correct' fix is to define dma_addr_t somewhere.
In file included from os.h:35,
                 from sound_firmware.c:1:
/usr/src/m68k/linux/include/linux/pci.h:324: parse error before `dma_addr_t'
