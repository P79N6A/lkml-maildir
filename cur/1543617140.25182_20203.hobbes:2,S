Don't understand it?  Download it, follow the directions, and see.
It's not that hard.  Given Giacomo's table of probes it only took me about
two days to get it 85% of the way there.  The remaining 15% is partly 
issues with rulebase bugs that it exposes, and partly issues with what
to do about the possibility of ISA hardware that is not directly probeable.
