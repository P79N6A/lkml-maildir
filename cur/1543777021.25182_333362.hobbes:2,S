You open the _correct_ framebuffer device.
Linux support multiple framebuffer devices, e.g.
/dev/fb0  /dev/fb1 /dev/fb2 ...
The matrox G550 support this, set the correct kernel config options
and you get both /dev/fb0 and /dev/fb1 (for the second head.)
This is the way to go if you want _independent_ monitors.
Some other drivers create a large framebuffer that spans several
monitors - ideal for the common case of one big desktop spread
across several monitors.  In those cases, you open /dev/fb0,
and find the different monitor bitmaps at different offsets inside that 
file.
