Turns out that it does -- once you tell Minicom to change its
bogus default of discarding data rather than line wrapping!
Which means there can still be multiple class instances that
get coupled to a given physical device; no lossage there.
Sigh.  It's hard sometimes to remember to apply all the
right bug workarounds, when some of them are in userspace.
Still, that's a needless incompatibility.  Why isn't that
pointing to a .../controller/spi_master:spi2 directory,
so that the pathnames don't change (only symlink polarity)?
