I like pci_request_irq(), but pci_valid_irq is bad.

Better would be:
#ifndef ARCH_VALIDATE_IRQ
static inline int valid_irq(unsigned int irq)
{
	return irq ? 1 : 0;
}
#endif
in linux/interrupt.h (around request_irq).
And it doesn't need to be a __must_check.  There's no point -- it has
no side-effects.  The only reason to call it is if you want the answer
to the question.  You had the sense of the return code wrong too; you
want to use it as:
int pci_request_irq(struct pci_dev *pdev, irq_handler_t handler,
			unsigned long flags, const char *name, void *data)
{
	if (!valid_irq(pdev->irq)) {
		dev_printk(KERN_ERR, &pdev->dev, "invalid irq\n");
		return -EINVAL;
	}
	return request_irq(pdev->irq, handler, flags | IRQF_SHARED, name, data);
}
