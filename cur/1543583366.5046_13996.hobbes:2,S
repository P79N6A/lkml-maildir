	Hello James ,  Yup that works alright .  But the difficulty
	Per & I were talking about is after the system (such as
	slackware's live-fs) is -shutdown- the CD drive bay is still
	locked ,  One has to hard-reset (or even power off for some)
	before the bay will open .  I am well aware why the bay does
	not open while the live-fs has it mounted .  But am quite
	baffled as to why the darn thing remains locked after system
	shutdown .  Again I am quite sure I know why that is happening
	as well .  The live-fs is hard read-only and the umount of the
	live-fs can not complete , so the CD drive never receives an
	unlock .  Sound about right ?  Twyl ,  JimL
