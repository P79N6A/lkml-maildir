  Hi, Linus. Someone sneaked the appended patch into 2.5.2-pre4, which
is not necessary and obviously wrong (the ChangeLog was correct
previously). Please revert.
Looks like the result of an automated global search-and-replace
(i.e. lazy cleanup). Pity a sanity a last-minute sanity check wasn't
performed by the guilty party.
</grumble>
