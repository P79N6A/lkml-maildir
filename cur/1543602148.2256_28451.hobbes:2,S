I absolutely agree that the split between probe and register needs to
be done.  The difference between calling startfn after stopfn and
forbidding that sequence is the difference between
  rmmod
    loses race
    return OK
    module is still in use, user is confused
and
  rmmod
    loses race
    calls startfn
    returns failure
    module is still in use, user is happy
Allowing startfn after stopfn gives a more consistent view of the
operation.
