This could be made into a useful interface:
echo "set 03:02" > /sys/power/resume
sets the resume device _and_ verifies its signature etc, the basic
sanity check done before resume. If this fails, we can go into some
interactive setup etc.
OTOH, the "resume 03:02" could also just fail if the image is invalid...
