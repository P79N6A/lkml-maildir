Alan, really, do you believe that relying on userspace to be always
correct is the way to go? Requrement for the userspace to always have
enough buffer available when doing some reading is essetually the same.
We want userspace to be non-recursive, but if this does not happen, we
should not hung. Detect recursion, do not allow more than 1-2-3
simultaneous modprobes, whatever, but do not say, that kernel behaves
that bad just because userspace is allowed to do that.
And what's the argument of being close to a release? Do you propose to
hide the head into the sand and point a finger to anyone else saying its
not a kernel's problem? If prerelease has a bug, it should be fixed, and
not hidden under the cover.
What about storing a small stack of recently requested device ids, and
if new request is about to ask one from that stack, return error? I can
cook up the patch tomorrow.
