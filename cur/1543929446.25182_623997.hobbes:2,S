once you are done with the download of the initial cloned git repository 
(which is 200MB+), all the bisection steps will be local and you'll be 
only limited by kernel rebuild speed and by bootup and testing speed, 
not by network bandwidth.
( once you have the cloned repository i'd suggest for you to keep it - 
  that way you can track susequent kernels via "git-pull" and it uses a 
  very network-efficient delta protocol. )
