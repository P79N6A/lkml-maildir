Hello people,
	On kernel 2.2.3
	I was doing a program of test that create another process using
"fork" and de parent process will show on terminal in loop something and
the child process will show another thing in loop to, but i had a
surprise...
	When i execute it, the parent process began to execute and the
child don't use the processor, only the parent processor until it
terminate, so the child use the processor until the end...They didn't
be schedule (parent after child, parent after child)....
	NOW, on kernel 2.0.36 what i was thinking to be happend (parent
after child, parent after child,...) comes true...
	I tested on sparc and Pentium-II machines... and the some think
occur.... 
	What do you think????
	Bye...
