perhaps i completely misunderstood what i was looking at but when i
submitted a patch to remove "legacy power management," i wasn't
referring to APM.  i was talking about the PM stuff even *older* than
that, that's listed as "Legacy Power Management API (DEPRECATED)"
under the PM config menu.
so, politics and scheduling aside, was that earlier patch a reasonable
and correct way to do *that*?
