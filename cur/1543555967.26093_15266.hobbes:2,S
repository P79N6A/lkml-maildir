It's not a real bug. - It's a call to BUG() in ntfs_get_block which is 
there because the function is not actually implemented. - I have only ever 
seen this happen when using midnight commander to browse through an NTFS 
partition. - It seems to never happen if I am just in bash typing away or 
ftp-ing into the machine with the mounted NTFS partitions.
When are you hitting this? - If you are using mc just refrain from using it 
for now for ntfs filesystems and all will be fine.
