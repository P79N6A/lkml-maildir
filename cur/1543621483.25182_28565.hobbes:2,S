Beware I may drive you to ruin if there will be less or more then 92 ;-)...

My main concern is simple the following: The broken design was there for 
already 8 years and
the cleanup just goes far too slow for my personal taste if it goes at 
the same peace of speed as
of now...

Well I have no problems to synchronize in small steps. However I have
problems with synchronization in microsteps, becouse due to my daily 
dueties, which btw.
have *nothing* with kernel hacking to do, I can hardly go below the
resolution of a day.... Or more precisely: some time at afternoon which 
can vary
between:
- nothing
- a whole night
- a whole weekend
depending on:
- my personal mood,
- my druglevel,
- blood preassure,
- my world domination dreams (Andre thinks so apparently :-),
- the current conjugation between saturn and venus,
and so on...
But in fact: I'm flexible and even more happy if somebody, who can 
certainly devote more
time to it then me, just picks the shit^Wsuggestions I call patches up...
In regards of Andre, well unfortunately, after reading his last mail 
about my employer and
what-a-not, well I  have some... please  excuse me... concerns about his 
mind-wellth ;-)
