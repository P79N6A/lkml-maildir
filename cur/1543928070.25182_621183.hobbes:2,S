The name is quite non-descriptive.  What about just leaving it as
filp_open and merging this into the previous patches to avoid
the spurious renaming?
And btw, exported functions that get half-rewritten should always
grow a kerneldoc comment.  Then again this particular one really
shouldn't be exported, but that's for another series.
