I must confess, with all due respect to Andi, that I don't understand his
dismissal of the possibility that load_cr3 in leave_mm might be the fix
(to create_elf_tables writing user stack data into the pmd).
My belief is that leaving any opening for unpredictable speculations to
pull stale translations into the TLB, is a recipe for strange trouble
down the line when those translations may get used in actuality.
I'd been hoping Andi would come to see it my way overnight!
since I'm clearly not up to arguing the case persuasively.
But I certainly don't expect Chris to add an unjustified patch to -stable.

Dave, earlier on you were quite able to reproduce the problem on 2.6.11,
finding it happened the first time you ran X.  Do you have any time to
reverify that, then try to reproduce with the load_cr3 in leave_mm patch?
But please don't waste your time on this unless you think it's plausible.
Thanks,
Hugh
