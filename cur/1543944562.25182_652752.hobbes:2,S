I remember vaguely that some years ago, we set up a box with four IDE
disks as a RAID set.  For that purpose, we added a PCI ATA100 controller
so that each disk could act as a primary IDE device and we were only able
to boot the system with the option ide=reverse.
That box has been replaced by some other so I cannot verify it but as
far as I remember it was a problem with disk numbering between BIOS,
bootloader and/or kernel.  Also, at that time we used lilo and I am not
sure if grub would have done better.
