You need QoS at the router level to resolve this. Since you are
running your own routers to connect your ethernet segments, QoS
should be done at both ends of the connection. If it's available
on your distro, try wondershaper, it's a nice script which you tell
your upstream and downstream rates and then it adjusts QoS parameters
to provide great response. The most important thing is that it prioritises
ACK packets above everything else. This helps a lot when there is heavy
traffic (FTP for example) in both directions at the same time.
