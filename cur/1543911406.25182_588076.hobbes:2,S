Hi Ingo,
the RT patches for .22 and .23 are passing an incorrect parameter to
rebalance_domains.
I had this queued up for a few days - its still wrong in .22 and .23 RT
patches.
Same issue has been fixed in mainline by:

    sched: run_rebalance_domains: s/SCHED_IDLE/CPU_IDLE/
    
    rebalance_domains(SCHED_IDLE) looks strange (typo), change it to
CPU_IDLE.
    
    the effect of this bug was slightly more agressive idle-balancing on
    SMP than intended.

Thanks,

This parameter was missed when SCHED_IDLE was replaced by CPU_IDLE.
