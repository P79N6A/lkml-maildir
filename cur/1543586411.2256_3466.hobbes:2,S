I often see requests for the output of "lspci -vvxxx" when developers
are looking into problems with handling pci bus bridging and quirks
in specific hardware.  For example, this info has been requested of
me for debugging a problem handling my Neomagic 2160, at least one
bug in early Yenta code and so on.  Does /proc/pci get you all the
information that would be obtained with "lspci -vvxxx"?
