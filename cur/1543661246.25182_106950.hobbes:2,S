The problem which I have been seeing with some regularity is not the hang
you describe (I see that infrequently) but rather a hang after I exit an
ssh connection. I open several dozen windows at a time to a cluster when I
do admin, and when I close almost always at least one doesn't drop without
"~." to help. So far in a hour I haven't seen that.
