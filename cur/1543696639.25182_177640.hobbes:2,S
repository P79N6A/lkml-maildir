Yes, I really would like all those apps to be hacked.
Because I want to REMOVE those nice() calls, not because I want to
add another piece of functionality that doesn't belong in apps in the
first place.
My opinion is that it's the system administrator's job to assign
nice-values to processes. Apps that do that themselves make the task
of the admin harder, if not impossible.
