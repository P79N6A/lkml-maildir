There's no FUD here.  The problem is that you didn't say that you've
designed this for only a few nines.  If you delete fsck from your
rationale, simply saying that you rely on UPS to give you time to flush
buffers, you have a much better story.  Certainly, once you've flushed
buffers and degraded to write-through mode, you're obviously as reliable
as ext2/3.
Your idea seems predicated on throwing large amounts of RAM at the
problem.  What I want to know is this: Is it really 25 times faster than
ext3 with an equally huge buffer cache?
