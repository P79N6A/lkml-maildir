Subject: shmem_file_setup creating SYSV00000000 files in (ext3) root filesystem
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

kernel version is 2.4.23.
the problem is caused by the fact that the checks that shmem_file_setup
does to determine the location of the mountpoint of tmpfs fail to take
into account the effect of pivot_root.
that is: if i mount a tmpfs as /, then mount a ext3 filesystem and
pivot_root into it with put_old as, say, /var/tmp, then shmem_file_setup
will still think that the tmpfs is mounted at / (and as a result creates
shared memory files on the root filesystem instead of on /var/tmp as it
ought to)
i'm not actually sure what the code in mm/shmem.c:shmem_file_setup()
does, but i assume the problem is this line:
	        root = shm_mnt->mnt_root;
and somehow as a result, this happens:

[many many many lines follow]
if you have any advice or can confirm to me that this is actually a bug
in the kernel, please reply.  i'm not on the list.
thanks,
ryan.
