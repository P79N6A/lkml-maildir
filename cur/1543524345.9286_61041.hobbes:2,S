	I've tried this version on my PREP PowerPC box without success.
Linux uncompress
	properly, and after this stage nothing, on the serial ouptut.
	This is the first beta kernel I test on this board. I don't know if
the failure is big endian related
	or related to my compiles fixes.
	If you have success on a Big-Endian system.
