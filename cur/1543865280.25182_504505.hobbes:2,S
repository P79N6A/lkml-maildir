No I/O errors should make there way to the upper-layers (block/FS).
The system *should* be shielded from the fibre-channel fabric events.
I just wanted to explain what the (basic sanity) test did.

Hmm, with this patch we've noted two main differences:
1) I/O throughput with the basic 'dd' command used (above) is back to
   60MB/s, rather than the appalling 20-22 MB/s we were seeing with
   2.6.20-rcX.
2) No panics -- so far with 2+ hours of testing.  With our vanilla
   system of 2.6.20-rc7, the test could trigger the panic within 15 to
   20 minutes.
We'll let this run over the weekend -- I'll certainly let you know if
anything has changed (failures).
