Hello everyone,
I'm using 2.6.20.7-rt8 on a P3.
I've noticed that the frequency offset of my system clock (computed 
either by ntpd, or by hand) changes drastically across reboots.
By drastically, I mean +/- 60 ppm every time I reboot.
Apparently this is caused by some imprecision in the frequency 
estimation done in calculate_cpu_khz() (arch/i386/kernel/tsc.c)
My brutally crude work-around was to skip the computation altogether and 
hard-code the "correct" value for cpu_khz.

Has this issue been investigated more thoroughly by other users?
Regards.
