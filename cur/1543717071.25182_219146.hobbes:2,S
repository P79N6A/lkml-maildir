Hah!  Delightful refutation of my little lecture.  Thanks a lot for
turning that up.  Hmm.  Well, I guess I need to research that one
further: a first guess would be that the generic variety is silly
to be doing an optimization which the specialist versions don't do:
but perhaps when I look I'll find some of them do.  Can scrub that
patch for now if you prefer, Andrew: world won't stop turning either way.
