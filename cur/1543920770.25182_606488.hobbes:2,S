I noticed that too.  I've got a patch for one bug (appended), and
will be looking at a fix for the second.

That issue is 49dce689ad4ef0fd1f970ef762168e4bd46f69a3, the
classdev-elimination patch from Tony Jones.  It broke the
"does this bus have more than one device" test by relocating
the relevant sysfs nodes.
Quick workaround for that one is to disable the fault return
after that test.

==========	CUT HERE
When enumerating MMC cards using SPI, don't support the "just probe"
mechanism since it doesn't always work.  Instead, always wait for the
reset to complete before issuing the next request.
This is a regression ... this SanDisk MMC card used to enumerate with
no trouble, despite this particular spec violation.
