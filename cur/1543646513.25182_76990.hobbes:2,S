I actually find this relatively disturbing:
Memory: 2584k/4352k available (881k kernel code, 1380k reserved, 171k data, 56k
init, 0k hi)
To truly scale this far downward finding ways to use less than 40% of
RAM on things allocated at or before boot-time seems necessary,
especially trimming down that 881KB.
I'll have to apologize that it's unlikely I'll be able to take any
direct action toward addressing this problem as my focus is elsewhere,
but I consider this a valid and even important concern.
