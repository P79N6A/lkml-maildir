Anybody could make the cache thrash. I don't see this as an argument against
O_STREAMING (whether explicitly activated, or dynamically activated).
The only extension I would suggest (I don't think the patch did this?) 
is that pages should only be candidates for being forgotten if all
open files associated with the page are O_STREAMING and all seek
points for all open files are beyond the page.
This would allow for a web app, or similar, that was serving the same
document over two different sockets, to provide a compromise between
O_STREAMING and not O_STREAMING where performance would suffer, but
for the common case, where only one person is accessing the file, the
full benefit of O_STREAMING would be realized.
Does the patch allow for mmap() to benefit from O_STREAMING?
