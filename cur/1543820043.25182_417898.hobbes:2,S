btw, I don't think a patch like this would be appropriate to mainline -
it's the sort of thing which just one or two people would use once or twice
per year.
So I'd be inclined to host it permanently in -mm, along with the other 37
mm-only debugging patches.
Consequently it doesn't have to be an especially gorgeous piece of code ;)
