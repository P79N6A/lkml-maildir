the initial plan was for a depreciation period. Sadly it was untenable since the API
was changing entirely to fix bugs and add a really important feature
(the ability to clflush the exact range rather than wbinvd'ing the caches of all cpus in the system), 
at which point we had to pull the function right away.
As for virtualbox; a fix for that already exists, and it consists of removing 25 lines of workarounds
for c-p-a bugs, and just using set_memory_x / set_memory_nx.
