Hmmm...  I hadn't considered that.  I assumed MSG_TRUNC not to be useful as
arbitrarily chopping bits out of the request or reply would seem to be
pointless.

Fixed.

Good point.  That's slightly tricky to deal with as output messages don't
remain queued on the socket struct itself.  Hmmm...
One thing I'd like to be able to do is pass the sk_buffs I've set up to UDP
directly rather than having to call the UDP socket's sendmsg.  That'd eliminate
a copy.  But I decided to get it working right first, then look at cute
optimisations like that.
Such a thing would also be useful for the AFS filesystem: it could pass skbuffs
it has preloaded to AF_RXRPC, which would then hand them on to UDP.

nAcks is a uint8_t.  If that can exceed RXRPC_MAXACKS (255) then I suspect I'll
have more pressing worries.  I could put a check in there, but the compiler
would give me a warning:-/

It's not an entirely insane protocol:-) Actually, part of the problem is Linux
itself.
