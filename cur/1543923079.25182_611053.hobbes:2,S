Subject: [PATCH] 0/3 fs/ioctl.c coding style, rename vfs_ioctl/do_ioctl
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This series of three proposed patches changes fs/ioctl.c and Unionfs as
follows.  This series is against v2.6.24-rc1-192-gef49c32.
Patch 1: just applies coding standards to fs/ioctl.c (while I'm at it, I
figured it's worth cleaning VFS files one at a time).
Patch 2: does two things:
(a) Renames the old vfs_ioctl to do_ioctl, because the comment above the old
    vfs_ioctl clearly indicates that it is an internal function not to be
    exported to modules; therefore it should have a more traditional do_XXX
    "internal function" name.  The new do_ioctl is exported in fs.h but not
    to modules.
(b) Renames the old (static) do_ioctl to vfs_ioctl because the names vfs_XXX
    should preferably be reserved to callable VFS functions which modules
    may call, as other vfs_XXX functions already do.  Export the new
    vfs_ioctl to modules so others can use it (including Unionfs and
    eCryptfs).
Patch 3: demonstrates how Unionfs can use the new vfs_ioctl.  I successfully
tested unionfs with this new exported vfs_ioctl.  (eCryptfs could do the
same.)
I'd like to propose that the first two patches be merged in -mm and even
mainline, pending review.
Erez Zadok (3):
      VFS: apply coding standards to fs/ioctl.c
      VFS: swap do_ioctl and vfs_ioctl names
      Unionfs: use vfs_ioctl
