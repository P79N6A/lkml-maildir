Hi,
Here are more comments/questions on Jim's alternate high-res-timers
patch.  Some of this is just to understand the code.
a.  Why return here and skip profiling?
    Is this an intermediate (high-res) timer interrupt that shouldn't be
    used for profiling?
 inline void smp_local_timer_interrupt(struct pt_regs * regs)
 {
   	int cpu = smp_processor_id();
+
+	if (!run_posix_timers((void *)regs))
+		return;
  	x86_do_profile(regs);
b.  In kernel/id2ptr.c,
<id_free_cnt>:  change cnt to count; just a style thing.
Linux doesn't use many abbreviations, which makes it easier on
everyone not having to remember "what is the abbreviation that code
uses for <whatever>?".
sub_alloc() is recursive.  How bounded is it?  32 calls max?
I'm not totally against recursion, but it needs to be *well-bounded*.
Same for sub_remove().
