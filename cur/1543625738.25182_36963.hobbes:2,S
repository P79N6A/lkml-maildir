Subject: inode-max missing?

I'm trying to fix a problem "too many open files" by adjusting
/proc/sys/fs/inode-max but I don't have one, it's missing.  I've gone
through the docs and they all reference it, but it's missing from parts of
the source susch as sysctl.c.
I'm running 2.4.18, btw.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks!
