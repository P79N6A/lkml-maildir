You take the TLB flush a few times, not every operation.  See the bit
about acls and such -- they set up a pool of shared pages between the
processes which are reused.  You should look at the paper again -- there
are various subtleties in there.

Apache doesn't have a cache, it can't do an efficient dynamic cache as a
multiprocess server... (if you find a solution that works tell us ;)

Not all data originates in the kernel -- the TCP-checksuming tricks don't
apply to data originated from userland. 
It's perfectly valid for a program to dynamically generate a bunch of
content in memory which is used over and over... and the io-lite stuff
transparently makes this work.  With sendfile()/etc I'd have to write this
to disk first to fool the kernel into TCP-checksum caching.
