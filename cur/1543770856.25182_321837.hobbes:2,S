Indeed, this controller in the 346s is a regression from the 345 
servers, which had an onboard LSI Logic Fusion MPT controller which 
could do hardware RAID 1, at least, and has a GPL driver.
Oh well.. if you really want to use hardware RAID, you can put in the 
ServeRAID-7k card, which is much better, and has a GPL driver.
