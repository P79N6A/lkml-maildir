Alan,
Which alternate charater set supports standard 256 ASCII codes just like
a PC, and is mappable to most of the planets terminals?   The ACS_*
symbols output strange characters in the Latin1 Char set when selected. 
I am headed towards the linux box to look at ncurses ALTCHARSET.
Please Advise.
Jeff
