OSX begat from NeXT and NeXT had these same "fat binaries". They are not new :)

you don't want that ;)

32bit user-space can run 100% on 64bit kernel, this is usual in sparc
if i'm not mistaken

just remember that linux is mainly about source access, so having
"fat" binaries is just wrong because the one-true-way is to get the
sources and compile for your arch directly. this can be done by hand,
semi-automated (aka gentoo) or automated (aka debian, fedora, etc...)
by just installing from precompiled binaries
