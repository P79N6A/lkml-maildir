I think that was 2.6.18+debian-added-dirty-page-tracking-patches.
If that memory is correct, I'll assert (and emphasise) that the cause of the
alleged BerkeleyDB corruption is not known at this time.
The post-2.6.19 "fix" might make it go away.  But if it does, we do not know
why, and it might still be there, only harder to hit.
