I imitated the style of the mail I replied to. Besides, choosing apps based on 
sound system is retarded if you wanted to indicate that this should be done 
more often or something.

Exactly! And the config file is hostile if you want to change it.

KDE 2 *was* released in 2000. Why would you care, I already admitted that 
sound daemons were there before ALSA.

Yep, because I was frustrated with the whole thing. Having huge bad APIs with 
no documentation is telling your fellow developers to piss off and do 
something else. I did.
It's not like a little oversight to be quickly forgotten. ALSA has been there 
for at least *five years* without documentation for most parts.

If you are not doing DMA from the sound card to kernel memory and then 
directly to disk blocks, you are using user space apps period. So what's 
different with capture?
