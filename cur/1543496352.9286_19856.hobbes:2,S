In fact, there already is a patch in the kernel:
CONFIG_APM_RTC_IS_GMT, but it's a temporary hack, until a better
scheme is implemented. The reason is that the kernel needs to know the
timezone the RTC is stored in when restoring the system clock after a
suspend/resume cycle. Automatically computing the difference has its
problems.
