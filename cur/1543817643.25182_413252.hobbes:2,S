Interesting.

The BIOS does various bits of PCI bus setup on some systems including
latency setting. That might be relevant, especially latency to get
bursting.

The CRC is computed between the controller as the bits get fired over
the cable and drive so it shouldn't be caused by any weird bus timings.
More info would be useful although it may be a while before I can look
at it
