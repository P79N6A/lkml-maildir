Hi!

I made some first tests with my laptop and the docking station:
1) cold start with laptop docked: 
 lots of PCI devices (Bus 0 and 7)
2) cold start with laptop undocked: 
 only a few PCI devices (only Bus 0)
3) cold start with laptop undocked, docked a lilo prompt: 
 only a few PCI devices (only Bus 0)
4) cold start with laptop docked, undocked a lilo prompt: 
 only a few PCI devices (only Bus 0)
First I missed one very important test, but did that today:
5) cold start with laptop docked, undocked a lilo prompt, redocked again at lilo prompt:
 a little more PCI devices (Bus 0 and 7)
Only the bridge and the SCSI controller showed up at the last
test. Test #1 showed some additional pcmcia bridges, the ide
controller and a few more. Cannot say the exact difference here, but
#1 and #5 definetly differ. Could post the output of /proc/pci, but I
don't think it's of much interest.
