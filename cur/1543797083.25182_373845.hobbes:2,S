Heh :) The failure is (IIRC, I don't have the serial logs to hand) 
before ide_start_power_step() is called. We get to start_request(), and 
the system then fails with "bus not ready on wakeup" and "drive not 
ready on wakeup". Calling the _GTM and _STM ACPI methods before then 
lets the system come back up normally.
