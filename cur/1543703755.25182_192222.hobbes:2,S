Ick ick ick.  I thought you all were not going to add this function, but
just use vio_register_driver() on it's own?  Loading a driver should not
depend on CONFIG_HOTPLUG, as we now have different ways we can bind
drivers to devices after they are loaded (see the new_id stuff for pci
devices as an example.)
In fact I have a patch in my queue to clean this logic up for PCI
drivers from rmk that I need to apply soon...
thanks,
