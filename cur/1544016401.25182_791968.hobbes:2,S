Beside reading the MSR register for UOC_REGISTERS_ADDR
it should be possible to use BAR0 of UOC PCI config
space (if UOC enabled in BIOS).
The UOC registers look good to me too except for bit VBUSVLD
(bit 8 in UOCMUX). This bit should get set when cable is
connected. Maybe VBUS pin is not connected. In this case the
internal pull up will not get connected. For testing the pull up can
be connected manually by clearing APU in UOCCAP and
setting PUEN in UOCMUX.
There is one remaining bit which could prevent the physical USB
connection. It is bit SD (soft disconnect) in UDC DEVCTL
register (bit 10). This bit has to be cleared. This is done by
usb_gadget_register_driver() in amd5536udc.c. This function is
called by gadget driver like g_zero when gagdet driver loads.
Maybe you want add a printk() there to check that the bit was
cleared. Furthermore it could help to enable DEBUG and
#define UDC_VERBOSE in amd5536udc.c to have a closer
look at what UDC driver is doing.
But if SD bit is cleared (and UOC bits seem OK as you showed)
then only hardware can be the root cause of the issue. If host
detects a USB connection it will automatically send a
GET_DESCRIPTOR message to UDC. You would see kernel
messages on host side, at least messages indicating that device
is not responding.
I found a Hurricane LX800 manual at
http://www.lippert-at.de/fileadmin/lippert-at/products/EPIC/Hurricane-LX800/TME-EPIC-HURLX-R1V4.pdf
saying that there is no type B device port and device port is port 3.
Do you have a different one?
Chapter 3.8, page 19:
4 standard USB 2.0 host ports are provided at the I/O panel
of the Hurricane LX800. . . Port 3 can be used as USB device
port. This feature must be enabled in BIOS
under Motherboard Device Configuration -> PCI Configuration.
UDC must be enabled; Port 3 assignment should be set to device.
