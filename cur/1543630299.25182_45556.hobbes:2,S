I'm not hitting it, but I came across it while writing an application server
based on TUX 2.1.0. I noticed that Ingo didn't lock a list during reads. As
long as his code traverses forward (which it does) all is well. If, however,
some module writer out there fails to lock a list for reads and traverses
said list in reverse, a failure could result. 
By logic design this assignment ordering eliminates the need for a read
lock, hence improving performance, not just data integrity.
