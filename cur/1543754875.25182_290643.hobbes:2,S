The current testing code just moves the HRT timers to a seperate list.
It's a linked list at them moment, which must be optimized when the
general dust settles.

Yep. The timers expire at random times. So it's likely to have short
sequences of timer interrupts going off. This needs reprogramming of the
PIT and processing of the expired timers.
