Unfortunately there are some problems with this solution:
1. One could use loadlin, etc. rather than LILO
2. One could use LILO, but on a different system, so boot records could be
built from lilo.conf on a filesystem which is even not mounted
(I myself often do that if I have multiple Linux systems installed on one
computer).
3. One could specify -m to lilo, so again parsing /etc/lilo.conf could be
misleading.

I would suggest using an approach implemented in RedHat Linux (see
initscripts parckage), or a similar approach.
The general idea is that contents of /proc/version is used to identify
kernel. It is a line like that below:
Linux version 2.2.5 (root@tst.tst) (gcc version 2.7.2.3) #1 Thu Apr 8 09:33:30 CEST 1999
Then for each kernel, a file containing this line is created when
installing the kernel; Name of this files is related to name of kernel
file is such a way, that kernel file name (and file names of related
files, e.g. System.map) can be easily derived.
System initialization script (rc.sysinit in RedHat Linux) scans the files
containing version lines for the contents of /proc/version, and makes
necessary symbolic links.
The solution used in RedHat Linux is good also for kernels which contains
modules.
Best regards,
Wojtek
