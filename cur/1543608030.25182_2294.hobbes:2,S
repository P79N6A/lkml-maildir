Hmm.... 64bit jiffies are attractive.
I'd like to see less #defines in kernel
Some parts of your patch fight with the fact that jiffies
is converted to macro -> it is illegal now to have local vars
called "jiffies". This is ugly. I know that there are tons of similarly
(ab)used macros in the kernel now but let's stop adding more!
This test prog shows how to make overlapping 32bit and 64bit vars.
It works for me.
 
#include <stdio.h>
typedef unsigned long long u64;
extern u64 jiffies_64;
extern unsigned long jiffies;
extern unsigned long jiffies_hi;
asm(
"	.bss\n"
"	.align 8\n"
".globl jiffies_64\n"
".globl jiffies\n"
".globl jiffies_hi\n"
"jiffies_64:\n"
// <- a bunch of ifdefs needed here to sort out endianness stuff...
"jiffies:\n"
"	.zero	4\n"
"jiffies_hi:\n"
"	.zero	4\n"
//not working!? how to return to prev .data/.text/whatever?
//I don't know gas...
//"	.previous\n"
);
int main() {
    jiffies_64 = 0xFEDCBA9876543210UL;
    printf("lo: 0x%08x\n",jiffies);
    printf("hi: 0x%08x\n",jiffies_hi);
    return 0;
}
Is this better or not? If not, why?
