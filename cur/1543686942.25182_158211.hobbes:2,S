If you really want this, patches to do so have been in hap-linux (2.2.x)
for a while, and they were picked up by grsecurity (2.4).  We both log 
SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGABRT, SIGILL currently; you could add others if you
desired.  The logging is rate-limited to reduce log-flood opportunities
(though as others have mentioned it's quite easy to flood logs through
other means).
