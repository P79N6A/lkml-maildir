Greetings,
I've been studying the 2.2 networking code and, well, I'm beginning to
feel overwhelmed...
I think I (mostly) understand the network driver part of it, but I'm
getting lost in the dst_entry area, I think from both directions...
I didn't find a whole lot on google or linux/Documentation .
Does anyone have pointers to information to guide me through the 2.2
networking code?  (Or even volunteers to give me an idea of what I'm
looking at and how it works?)  I'm particularly interested in
information on the API boundaries in the 2.2.x network code.
TIA,
Eli
