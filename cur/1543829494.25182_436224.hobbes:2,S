yes with the patch below it seems useless. But it's also a good way
for all arch to use the same name for defining the start of the
memory.

[PATCH] flatmem: tiny optimisation when memory do not start at 0
The FLATMEM memory model assumes that memory is in one contigious area
based at pfn 0. Some archictectures, like ARM, use ARCH_PFN_OFFSET to
relax this requirement. This involves one more operation during
page/pfn conversions.
Instead this patch modifies the address of mem_map to make
mem_map[ARCH_PFN_OFFSET] pointing at NODE_DATA(0)->node_mem_map.
This results in a slight gain on kernel code size.
