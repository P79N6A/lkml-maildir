I'm not sure it's a good idea really. I think people have the reasonable
expection that if you use hugetlb you really get huge pages.
If you really implement you should at least printk clearly. But it's 
probably better to not implement it.
If there was generic transparent hugepages support in the VM the case
would be probably different. Then it would make sense. But not as part
of hugetlbfs.
