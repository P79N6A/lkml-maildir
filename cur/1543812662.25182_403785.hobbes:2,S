I just build and booted a2.6.16-rc5-git8 with the same config that I
used for the -mm kernel and the problem did not manifest itself there.
So it seems that mainline is fine but we need to find the bug before
it propagates from mm to mainline.
I'll test a -mm kernel without slab debug/poison now to see it it goes Oops.
