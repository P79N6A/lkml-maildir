Can you try with PnP and the i82365 support _disabled_. I find this sequence
very suspicious:
        Intel PCIC probe: PNP <6>pnp: Device 00:17 activated.
        invalid resources ?
        pnp: Device 00:17 disabled.
        not found.
and I bet it messes up some of the register state that the yenta probe had
just set up.
You should try with just CONFIG_YENTA - the 82365 stuff is for the old
16-bit only controllers.
