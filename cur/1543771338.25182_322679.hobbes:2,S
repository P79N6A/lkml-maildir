The best solution for this would be to check the available protocols at
setup time and not at connection creation time. This would also provide
a better feedback to the user, since he will either see that what he set
was taken, or it wasn't.
In the current mechanism you can set the protocol to 'foo' and it will
show back as 'foo'. You'll get complaints only once a connection is
attempted with this protocol.
It does mean some extra work in the sysctl stage, but it's better IMO to
do it there rather than at connection setup time.
