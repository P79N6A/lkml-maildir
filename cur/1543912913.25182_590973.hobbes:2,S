thanks. FYI, there's plenty of time - i'll be at the KS next week so 
i'll be quite unresponsive to emails. Would be nice if you could take a 
quick look at the trivial patch i posted today though. How close is it 
to your algorithm, have i missed any important details? (not counting 
nice levels and rounding, it's just a quick & dirty prototype to show 
the first layer of the core math and nothing more.)
