Yes, I still can't believe this, but after some more reading I start
to admit such things can happen in computer "science" too... I've
mentioned a lost performance, but as a matter of fact I've been more
concerned with the problem of truth:
From: Intel(R) 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual
Volume 3A:
   "7.2.2 Memory Ordering in P6 and More Recent Processor Families
    ...
    1. Reads can be carried out speculatively and in any order.
    ..."
So, it looks to me like almost the 1-st Commandment. Some people (like
me) did believe this, others tried to check, and it was respected for
years notwithstanding nobody had ever seen such an event.
And then, a few years later, we have this:
From: Intel(R) 64 Architecture Memory Ordering White Paper
    "2 Memory ordering for write-back (WB) memory
     ...
     Intel 64 memory ordering obeys the following principles:
     1. Loads are not reordered with other loads.
     ..."
I know, technically this doesn't have to be a contradiction (for not
WB), but to me it's something like: "OK, Elvis lives and this guy is
not real Paul McCartney too" in an official CIA statement!

I'm still so "dazed and confused" that I can't tell this (or anything)
is right...
Thanks very much for so extensive and sound explanation,
Jarek P.
PS: Btw, I apologize Helge for not trusting her: "verification by
testing would not be trivial" words.
