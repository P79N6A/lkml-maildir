Wouldn't this be a classical birthday problem with 50% collision chance
popping up in and around a few hundred devices? [20 for 8 bits, 23 for
365, 302 for 16 bits, 77163 for 32 bits], and that's only in a single
system - with hundreds of thousands of systems even a 0.1% collision rate
is deadly. [0.1% collision rate at 32 bits with 2932 devices]  Even with 
only 300 devices per system, you'll still get a collision (at 32 bits) on 
more than 1 system in a hundred thousand.
Cheers,
MaZe.
