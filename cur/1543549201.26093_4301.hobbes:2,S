I hope we can have a swap mechanism that gradually writes stuff 
into swap early on, but don't actually unmap the memory.
So we get clean pages that are still available but may be dropped
quickly if needed.  This will smooth things a bit without
degrading performance.
Some memory should be kept around for cache (if the processes do
any io at all) or you'll get io trashing: the same stuff read 
over and over from files instead of from cache.  And a read
before every write that isn't a complete block.
Almost all processes have some pages they don't use much, such
as startup initialization.  Swapping out that doesn't hurt.
