Just in case it matters any, here's the Clie (760C) part of my
/proc/bus/usb/devices:
T:  Bus=01 Lev=02 Prnt=02 Port=01 Cnt=01 Dev#=  3 Spd=12  MxCh= 0
D:  Ver= 1.10 Cls=ff(vend.) Sub=00 Prot=00 MxPS=16 #Cfgs=  1
P:  Vendor=054c ProdID=0066 Rev= 1.00
S:  Manufacturer=Sony Corp.
S:  Product=Palm Handheld
C:* #Ifs= 1 Cfg#= 1 Atr=c0 MxPwr=  0mA
I:  If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 2 Cls=ff(vend.) Sub=00 Prot=00 Driver=serial
E:  Ad=82(I) Atr=02(Bulk) MxPS=  64 Ivl=  0ms
E:  Ad=02(O) Atr=02(Bulk) MxPS=  64 Ivl=  0ms
I'll also be a test monkey for the patch.
