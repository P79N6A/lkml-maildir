I don't have any objections to the idea of the patch, but I'm still
concerned about the practical aspects of it.  Maintaining these kinds of
annotations is hard/fragile/etc when the compiler doesn't warn when you
get it wrong, and only a very specific use-case will reveal the problem
(and do so in a fairly obscure way).

Hm, "asmcall" is confusingly close to "asmlinkage" - and they have
exactly the same intent (can be called from asm), but with exactly the
opposite effect.  How about something which actually says what we mean. 
How about just "regparm"?
