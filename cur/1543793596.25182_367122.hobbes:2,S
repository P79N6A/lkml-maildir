I somehow expected that answer, it took me quite some time to figure 
what the patch does.  It certainly needs at least a number of cleanups 
before I'd consider it mergable.  The alternative() macro is much easier 
to read.

Well, the "no hotplug" probably is exactly the reason why the patch 
doesn't use the existing alternatives mechanism, it's a boot-time 
one-way ticket.  The xenified linux kernel actually switches both ways 
at runtime if you plug in/out a second virtual CPU.

I don't like the idea very much.  That covers only 50% of what the patch 
does, you can patch SMP => UP but not the other way around.  Doesn't 
matter much on real hardware, but for virtual it is quite useful.

Yep, extending alternatives is probably better than duplicating the 
code.  Maybe having some alternative_smp() macro which places both code 
versions into the .altinstr_replacement table?  If that sounds ok I'll 
try to come up with a experimental patch.  If not: other ideas are welcome.
cheers,
