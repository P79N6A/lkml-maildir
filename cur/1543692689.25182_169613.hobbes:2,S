Superb analysis!
It does indeed explain Klaus' oops.  unqueue_me() and futex_poll()
hash using &q->key outside any spinlocks, so if there's a concurrent
futex_requeue() the hash can be corrupt.  Result: wrong lock taken;
list manipulation races in test6, not in test5.  (Provided Klaus has
SMP or pre-empt).
Solutions are to call hash_futex() inside the lock, or store the
hash result inside futex_q, and read it inside the lock.
You're right, the key_refs version is more exposed, but because of the
change to futux_requeue logic rather than anything to do with key_refs.

Logically, zero num in FUTEX_QUEUE shouldn't wake anything either, but
it's understood that at least one is always woken.  It's a bit of a
wart I agree, but I'll go along with Ulrich's view.
Thanks,
