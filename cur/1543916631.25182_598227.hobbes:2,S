I've done a quick review and except for my usual nitpicking it looks
very good to me.  I'll try my sputrace code with this version and will
report on how it works.
I'd really love to see markers in 2.6.24.  The impact to core code of
the actual markers is minimal with some more struct fields in functions
in the module code, although we'll want Mathieu's fix for the modules
list aswell which is a little more invasive.  But I think we want that
one anyway.
I'd say we probably don't want the blktrace conversion that late in the
game, though - but we can queue that once together with the optimizations
from Mathieu's earlier patches in -mm.
