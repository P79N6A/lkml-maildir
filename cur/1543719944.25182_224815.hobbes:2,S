I just stepped into testing the 2.4.27pre series and found
a small problem with "make xconfig"
the following change in "drivers/hotplug/Config.in" breaks
the tcl/tk script:
+dep_mbool '    For AMD SHPC only: Use $HRT for resource/configuration' CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_SHPC_PHPRM_LEGACY $CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_SHPC
It chokes on the $HRT which is an undefined variable.
I do not know what this variable is supposed to mean
(and if it is evensupposed to be interpreted as variable),
but as it is located in some string used as a user message
only I changed it to
+dep_mbool '    For AMD SHPC only: Use HRT for resource/configuration' CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_SHPC_PHPRM_LEGACY $CONFIG_HOTPLUG_PCI_SHPC
and now "make xconfig" works fine (one could also escape
the "$HRT" in the string, I guess).
Otherwise, 2.4.27pre5 compiles and boots fine on one of my
test systems (out of one I tested so far ;-)
One thing I noticed though: device numbering for the e1000
driver seems to have changed on this hardware: what was eth0
under 2.4.26 is now eth1 and vice versa.
The system has two Intel GBit ethernet NIC:
00:00.0 Host bridge: ServerWorks CNB20-HE Host Bridge (rev 31)
00:00.1 Host bridge: ServerWorks CNB20-HE Host Bridge
00:00.2 Host bridge: ServerWorks CNB20-HE Host Bridge
00:02.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corp. 82540EM Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 02)
00:03.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Rage XL (rev 27)
00:0f.0 ISA bridge: ServerWorks CSB5 South Bridge (rev 93)
00:0f.1 IDE interface: ServerWorks CSB5 IDE Controller (rev 93)
00:0f.2 USB Controller: ServerWorks OSB4/CSB5 OHCI USB Controller (rev 05)
00:0f.3 Host bridge: ServerWorks GCLE Host Bridge
00:10.0 Host bridge: ServerWorks: Unknown device 0101 (rev 03)
00:10.2 Host bridge: ServerWorks: Unknown device 0101 (rev 03)
00:11.0 Host bridge: ServerWorks: Unknown device 0101 (rev 03)
00:11.2 Host bridge: ServerWorks: Unknown device 0101 (rev 03)
01:02.0 SCSI storage controller: Adaptec AIC-7892A U160/m (rev 02)
02:04.0 SCSI storage controller: LSI Logic / Symbios Logic 53c1030 (rev 07)
02:04.1 SCSI storage controller: LSI Logic / Symbios Logic 53c1030 (rev 07)
03:02.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corp. 82544GC Gigabit Ethernet Controller (LOM) (rev 02)
2.4.27pre5 uses PCI device 03:02.0 as eth0 while 2.4.26 uses
PCI device 00:02.0 as eth0 (both systems were booted with "pci=noacpi")
This is just a minor annoyance, though (I have to change
network cabling when rebooting the machine between 2.4.26
and 2.4.27pre5)
