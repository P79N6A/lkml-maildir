This has nothing to do with the AIO interface.
Any write where the write returns immediately without syncing the file
is asynchronous. This includes most normal write()s where you're not
using O_DIRECT, O_SYNC or somesuch, and writes to memory-mapped files.
And no, prior to -mm3, there was absolutely no indication that these
failed writes occurred. It was simply dropped. Now it should be
reported in the logs and at the next sync point.

Not sure what you're referring to here.

For various reasons, there was previously no infrastructure for
transmitting write failure back to the writer after the page cache had
taken ownership of the write.
