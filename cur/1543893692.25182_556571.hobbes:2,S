I've applied the patch, but the oops is a kernel panic, so I can't generate a
dmesg including it. ;-)
Here's the dmesg output from a fresh boot (runlevel 2):

Here's a picture of the oops taken after a failed attempt to suspend:

Here's a picture of the oops taken after a failed attempt to offline CPU1
using 'echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online':

[Sorry for the quality of pictures, I couldn't get anything better.]
