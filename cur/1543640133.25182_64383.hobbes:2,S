What's been missing is the there is no option for synchronization as part of 
the parent notification or exit processing.
What's needed, for TCore, is something like "when a process dies, signal 
parents to do X and then wait on optional semaphore" before losing all the 
process data to do_exit.
The big problem I've been had with TCore is that that there is no polite way 
of synchronization for the dumping process with the parent and sibling 
processes while they are getting a signal storm as they all go down.  
I've come up with a few brutish ways to suspend these processes (with some 
risk taken with semaphore locks from a maintenance point of view ;).  
However; these approaches still sometimes don't get to run before some of the 
siblings exit.
There is no good way, especially on SMP setups with a large multi-threaded 
applications, to guarantee the signals don't get where they are going before 
the core dump data is gathered.
