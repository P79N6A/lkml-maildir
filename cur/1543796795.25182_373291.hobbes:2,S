Ah, that should have read "libc.5(*) to glibc" switchover"?

Was it? And it was ages ago (i can't even remember since when I disable
a.out in the kernel completely and never had a problem with it).

Of course. Especially if you started to use the permission system and
not let the NT installation stay in the default mode where every user
may do everything everywhere (and they are hiding the contents of
certain directories in the file browser instead of simply letting the
administrator change it's contents so that folks really learn it).

No, since we interface here with the commercial world , it is a
commercial offer (well, sort of - at least a an offer to provide an
offer it the details and requirements are defined/clear).

$COMPANY wants a maintained "open" driver (probably GPL but that's not
the point)?
$COMPANY gives us money (a to be defined amount of money for a to be
defined time, for to be defined distributions and/or kernel trees, to be
defined QA with respect to the hardware driven by the driver, etc.) and
we do that for you.
Feel free to ignore it ....
