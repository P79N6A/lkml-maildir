Subject: [bug?] raid1 integrity checking is broken on 2.6.18-rc4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/12/6

Doing this on a raid1 array:
        echo "check" >/sys/block/md0/md/sync_action
On 2.6.16.27:
        Activity lights on both mirrors show activity for a while,
        then the array status prints on the console.
On 2.6.18-rc4 + the below patch:
        Drive activity light blinks once on one drive, then the
        array status prints (obviously no checking takes place.)
Applied hotfix on 2.6.18-rc4:
