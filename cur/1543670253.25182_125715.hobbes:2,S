OK, thanks.
I'm rather buried in timer patches at present.  It would be best if you could
test new work in the context of those patches.
They are at 
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/timers/
The applying order is
	posix_timers-CLOCK_MONOTONIC-fix.patch
	jiffies_to_timespec-fix.patch
	do_timer_overflow-locking-fix.patch
	lost-tick-fix.patch
