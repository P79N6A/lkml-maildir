That seems more or less like not actually 
supporting streams at all.

Why? Do posix FSes care about EAs?

In a very ugly way -- sort of like using that "tire 
in a can" to fix a flat. Yeah, it plugs the hole. How
is "mv" supposed to work with ".LinuxDouble" directories?

Cripes. Nextstep again. Let's make everything look like a 
posix FS, but make everything else about filesystems and 
applications look like RiscOS or NextStep. That's actually
_more_ disruptive.
If the streams access method we decide on is a _superset_
of posix Fs requirements, what's the problem? Posix apps
still get what they expect. So extending the namespace
to provide streams support seems like a reasonable idea.
