why would the memory use change when the new kernel is run? is it becouse 
of whatever it does to the devices for the hand-off?

uswsusp has the problem that you are trying to run some userspace, but not 
other userspace as you are doing the hibernate. with this approach you 
don't have that problem since you are running a completely seperate 
userspace.

Ok, I could easily be misunderstanding something here (and the comments 
with the latest 'kexec back and forth' patch indicate there may still be 
work to do here after all)

but kexec isn't needed during the restore process, is it?
