I have been asked to add the ability to notify userspace when the time of day 
changes.  The actual notification is the easy part.  I'm having issues with 
where exactly the time is really changed.
do_settimeofday() is pretty straightforward.  No problems there.
adjtimex() with ADJ_OFFSET_SINGLESHOT mode seems reasonable as well.
adjtimex() with ADJ_OFFSET is a bit harder to follow.  Can you give me any 
pointers on what's going on with ADJ_OFFSET?
Thanks,
Chris
