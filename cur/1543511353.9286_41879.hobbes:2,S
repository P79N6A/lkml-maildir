What is the status of Linux multithreading? I'm starting to write a
device driver (which is basically a pipe which will forward ioctl()s to
the other end), and I'm confused as to when exactly context switches may
occur. It seems like they can only happen within certain functions, but
not inside my actual read() implementation etc. Is this going to change
any time soon? Should I write my code assuming context switches may
occur anywhere so my code will work without modification when that
happens? If so, is there a function up_and_interruptible_sleep_on(sem,
queue) (which is atomic)? Any answers/pointers to docs would be
appreciated.
