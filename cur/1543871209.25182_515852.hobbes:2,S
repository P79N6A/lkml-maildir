This paragraph I don't seem to understand. Either the device is claimed by 
hid-input (*), and then when the device is behaving more-or-less 
correctly, hid-input handles the usages sent in reports and maps them 
properly to input events. New mapping can be quite trivially added to 
hid-input.
If the HID device is not claimed by hid-input, then userspace can access 
the hid events through hiddev and perform any actions that are needed.
Could you please elaborate a little bit more why your approach using 
"simple HID interface" is better than for example hiddev+uinput, done 
completely in userspace?
In addition to that, as I stated in some previous e-mail, I am currently 
working on new 'hidraw' interface, which will provide more flexibility to 
userland applications willing to operate on raw HID data, than they 
currently have with hiddev.
(*) OK, I would tend to agree that the algorithm which decides whether the 
given device will be claimed by hid-input driver could be improved to be 
more HID-specification and HUT compliant. I have this in my TODO, but I 
guess it doesn't matter too much here.
Thanks,
