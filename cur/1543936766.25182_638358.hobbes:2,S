Initial testing indicates that 2.6.24-rc6-mm1 plus this one commit is
behaving itself correctly - my Tcl test case that reliably demonstrated wedges
during SYN handling is definitively fixed, and the current issue with hangs with
data pending seems to be gone as well (after admittedly light testing).
Thanks for finding the commit that fixed it...
