Yes, but this makes the wm97xx-battery device depend on configuring in the
touchscreen.
The problem we're having is that when we updated wm97xx-core.c from
version 0.62 to 0.65 the ADC values returned by wm97xx_read_aux_adc() to
the battery driver changed.  We did modify both versions to make the
struct wm97xx * global so the battery monitor could pass it to
wm97xx_read_aux_adc() (is there a better way?).

They don't just coexist with soc, they depend on it.  If you configure out
the AC97 driver under soc the touchscreen and battery drivers won't work
(but they'll build).  We used the same architecture as tosa and retained
the OH guys for the app framework (and platform assistance - thanks RP :).

In my mind the wm97xx-core module is independent and exposes an API backed
by wm9712/13/etc.  Layered above that, built into their respective code
areas, are the sound, touchscreen, battery monitor, various platform usage
of the aux ADC channels, etc.  I'm not saying this is possible, without
caveat, or practical, but I would say academically ideal.  Thanks for
keeping the conversations going, as I appreciate these drivers moving into
mainline which reduces our maintenance impact.

The first release is publicly available; the release I'm working on was
aimed for the 2.6.24 merge window but some key stuff (ARM clock/power
management, USB gadget) changed causing me to re-engineer.  I'm still
troubleshooting some 2.6.18-->24 port issues here (pxa27x_ac97 errors on
resume - we use deep sleep, not sleep on the pxa270), but can publicize a
source tarball and send you the link.
