The casts to (unsigned long long) just fix the printk() args to match
the format strings (and eliminate warnings).
Looks to me like sdkp->capacity is correct.  The <mb> value looks
way off.  Since it's just printed here for user info, I don't see
how it can be a problem later on.
I don't see the error just yet.  Are there any other SCSI device-
related messages near these?  And just to confirm, but you must
have CONFIG_LBD (Large Block Device) enabled, right?
