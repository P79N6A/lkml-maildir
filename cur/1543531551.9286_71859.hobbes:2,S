Hi guys,
Two problems:
1. can't exec /sbin/init on SMP systems
2. 8139too doesn't work on UP and SMP systems
More details:
1. booting SMP system I fail to open /dev/console with
the usual warning and then fail to exec /sbin/ with the usual
"advice" to pass "init="
2. 8139too driving ATX2500 cards on 100Mbit hub gives a 200 bytes/second
ftp speed instead of the usual 4Mbytes/second.
I will look closely at problem 1. now because I need to use this SMP
machine to do something.
Regards,
Tigran
