The unhappy one looks like this:
udi = '/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/pci_8086_4220'
  info.udi = '/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/pci_8086_4220'  (string)
  linux.subsystem = 'pci'  (string)
  linux.hotplug_type = 1  (0x1)  (int)
  pci.subsys_product = 'Unknown (0x2711)'  (string)
  pci.subsys_vendor = 'Intel Corporation'  (string)
  info.product = 'PRO/Wireless 2200BG Network Connection'  (string)
  pci.product = 'PRO/Wireless 2200BG Network Connection'  (string)
  info.vendor = 'Intel Corporation'  (string)
  pci.vendor = 'Intel Corporation'  (string)
  pci.device_protocol = 0  (0x0)  (int)
  pci.device_subclass = 128  (0x80)  (int)
  pci.device_class = 2  (0x2)  (int)
  pci.subsys_vendor_id = 32902  (0x8086)  (int)
  pci.subsys_product_id = 10001  (0x2711)  (int)
  pci.vendor_id = 32902  (0x8086)  (int)
  pci.product_id = 16928  (0x4220)  (int)
  info.linux.driver = 'ipw2200'  (string)
  pci.linux.sysfs_path = '/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:02:02.0'  (string)
  info.parent = '/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/pci_8086_2448'  (string)
  info.bus = 'pci'  (string)
  linux.sysfs_path_device = '/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:02:02.0'  (string)
  linux.sysfs_path = '/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1e.0/0000:02:02.0'  (string)
Will let you know when my bisecting finds a happy one.
