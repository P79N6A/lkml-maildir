Hi,
In the MAINTAINERS file, there is an address for a mailing list under the "VIA 82Cxxx AUDIO DRIVER" heading.
I tried sending a mail there, and it got bounced back (user unknown).
I found an archive of this list on MARC, but as you can see it hasn't been active for about a year:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-via&r=1&w=2
Looks like that list is gone. Here's a patch to remove it from MAINTAINERS.
Daniel.
