A small update to this. It seems the above mentioned interrupt fails
somewhere around the 128GB boundary. Interrupt 13h, AH=42 uses a 64
bit sector address and should be capable of addressing the entire
drive. For a SATA controller, this limitation seems relatively
arbitrary. For IDE controllers, a limitation such as this is
apparently common.
