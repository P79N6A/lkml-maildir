  I'd like to take the opportunity to report a bug with meye.  I've
ran various 2.6.* kernels on this recently acquired laptop, including
2.6.10-rc1 with your patches, all that with a Debian system on it
(Sarge/testing).  I figured the simplest way to test the meye driver,
and to grab a shot from it, would be to use "motioneye -j foo.jpeg".
Everytime I run that, though, the motioneye process gets stuck into an
apparently endless loop.  top shows it alternatively at states R and
D, I can't kill it (even -9), and the kernel repeatedly complains
"meye: need to reset HIC!".  Repeatedly, as in about twice a second
until reboot.  Oh, and no picture ever comes out, either :-)
  Bits of info you may want:

- Sony Vaio model PCG 141C,  a member of the C1VE series;
- motioneye 1.2-3 from Sarge;
- dmesg says:
