Hi all,
here's a patch that makes the bootlogo optional by using a config option.
The patch was tested successfully on x86 hardware. The only part I don't
know much about is in drivers/video/newport_con.c
The kernel image is now 8K smaller and I no longer have scrolling
problems using matroxfb.
The patch is against a clean 2.3.18 kernel.
Enjoy,
Patrick
