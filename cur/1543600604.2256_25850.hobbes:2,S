I've tested your former patch against 2.4.7-acX and sent you some feedback 
but you didn't answered my post.
Is the module problem (missing preempt_xxx symbols) thing fixed?
Aside from that I saw some nice speed increase (UP Athlon) and very snappy 
system.
dbench-1.1 32 clients load drops to mostly below 16 (33 before)
Go on with your great work!
Greetings,
