I guess FS is FS like you said ... OEM is who labels the box on the
shelf, and I guess MAN is manufacturer.  I would have said "Mfr".
I'm still not clear on the difference between the roles of the OEM and
the Mfr here -- are they really two different parties that *both* muck
with the drive firmware to change the visible sector count?  What does
the OEM do that the Mfr hasn't already done, and why?
