Even Maxtor should have a utility to control what modes the drives are
allowed to use.  If your box isn't smart enough on its own to limit things
to a safe range, then grab a copy of said utility and lock the drives down
so that they CAN'T be used in UDMA5.  Most of them just require booting
from a floppy....
Not so tough.
