OK. I did run some tests at one stage which didn't show a regression
on my P4, however I don't know that they were statistically significant.
I'll try a couple more runs and post numbers.

Sorry, I didn't parse this? But I wonder whether it is better to do
it in vmtruncate_range than the filesystem? Private COWed pages are
not really a filesystem "thing"...

OK, I think you're right. I _think_ it should also be OK with the
lock_page version as well: we should not be able to have any pages
after the first unmap_mapping_range call, because of the i_size
write. So if we have no pages, there is nothing to 'cow' from.

It also fixes a bug, doesn't it? ;)
