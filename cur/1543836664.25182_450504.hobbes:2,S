Thanks, that description was very helpful.  Would you accept a patch
with adding a comment describing this?  I couldn't figure it out from
looking at the source and googling "ASF" turned up lots of other uses

It appears that there is no way of disabling ASF; is that a true
statement?
Thanks, regards,
