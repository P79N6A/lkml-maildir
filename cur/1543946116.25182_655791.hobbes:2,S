I'm all for that, but also I don't want to see it blow up regularly
in the face of people who just enable all the selftest options.  The
other tests have a much better expectation of working "by default".

Thing is, this will catch not just regressions ... but cases where
STR never worked in the first place.  Video problems, etc.  Also
various system startup races, as in the PCMCIA and MMC/SD/SDIO
cases I noted.

Until it starts working on a given platform, it *IS* a fact of life.
Once it works, then it's fair to enter "no regressions" mode.  Despite
all the recent improvements, I think it's unwise to pretend that STR
works properly on most systems.

Right, and the best way to ensure that it's only *regressions* that
break things is to expect someone to have configured the kernel command
line appropriately (in grub or whatever).
Another way to achieve that is to include the test code based on one
config option, and change the test *mode* based on another one.  That
way a distro could include that in standard kernels with "no test" mode
as the default, but it would be easy to enable only for oneshot tests
or field troubleshooting ... while developers could turn on the more
dangerous "always test STR" (or standby, or hibernate) mode, if they
were helping to find and fix problems surfaced by such tests.
