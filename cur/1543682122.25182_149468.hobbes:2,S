The other points you mentioned preclude merging it into mainline right
now anyway and needs fixing. Your comments there are spot on.
However, while I agree about this being cruft in qla2xxx, it is _used_.
It's a driver / HBA feature which is actively deployed. I'd like to see
it go sooner than later, but by blocking this feature you preclude
those users of the driver from using the mainline one again, which is
the entire point of this exercise.
Dropping such a feature needs some preparation to protect the users, and
isn't justified by the personal dislikes of myself or you I'm afraid
;-)
Sincerely,
