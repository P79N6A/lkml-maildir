OK, fair enough.  What I said wasn't quite right, but in my case I
think neither of your reasons really applies, since the uninitialized
variable would be written into some hardware control block, so the
effect would probably still be random even if the value is the same
and the information leak doesn't really matter.
Anyway, I think that in this case it's not too hard to show that the
variable really can't be used uninitialized, so I prefer the smaller
generated code from uninitialized_var() (plus a comment explaining why
that's safe).

In this case the code is basically
	u32 x;
	for (n = 0; cond; ++n) {
		...
		if (!n)
			x = something;
		...
	}
	if (n) {
		...
		use(x);
		...
	}
and gcc still warns...
