I've had only two problems with my Tiger MP and 2.4.20:
- Set "CONFIG_AMD_PM768" to "n", with "y" the system will freeze somewhere in
the boot process;
- if you use Athlon XPs, make sure the L5 bridge is really securely connected.
Oh, and don't use too much unregistered ram...
Apart from that I've never had any issues. As the first touches power
management, it might be relevant.
Are your problems with rebooting only? Do you have ACPI enabled? I've ACPI
enabled and APM disabled (shouldn't work on SMP anyway).
MfG, Ulrich
