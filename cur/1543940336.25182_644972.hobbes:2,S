Thanks. I am aware of these issues and we already have a pretty capable 
layer to deal with these issues (unfortunately, it was very necessary). 
My problem is not with the data carried by the IOCTL, but with IOCTL 
command code itself, which comes out wrong on the kernel side. And my 
problem is not only in the size data, but also in other fields.
IOCTL command code:
1 byte: W/R/RW                                       -------- Passes 
through fine
1 byte: size of data carried                         -------- DOESN'T 
PASS THROUGH
1 byte: identifier character of the module   -------- Passes through fine
1 byte: IOCTL number                               -------- DOESN'T PASS 
THROUGH
The funny thing is that I always get the same IOCTL command code on the 
kernel side, no matter what I send using the ioctl() system call.
Any idea?
Thanks
