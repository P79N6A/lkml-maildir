I reported a regression, that when a usb-key is connected, #lilo produces a bootloader which don't work, on 2.6.24-rc6-git2, diferently to kernels before.
Yesterday I compiled 2.6.24-rc6-git8 with exactly the same kernel parameters, with this, the problem didnt occure again, on the same 2 computers.  Thus probably the problem was resolved
