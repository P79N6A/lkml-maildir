I put the following familiar-looking code at the head of linuxbios for
mainboards that need to boot 2.2.x. It should look familiar, except of
course this is 32-bit gas-compatible code. 
#define i8259delay jmp 1f ; 1:
        movb    $0x11,%al               /*! initialization sequence*/
        outb    %al,$0x20               /*! send it to 8259A-1*/
        i8259delay
        outb    %al,$0xA0               /*! and to 8259A-2*/
        i8259delay
        movb    $0x20,%al               /*! start of hardware int's
(0x20)*/
        outb    %al,$0x21
        i8259delay
        movb    $0x28,%al               /*! start of hardware int's 2
(0x28)*/
        outb    %al,$0xA1
        i8259delay
        movb    $0x04,%al               /*! 8259-1 is master*/
        outb    %al,$0x21
        i8259delay
        movb    $0x02,%al               /*! 8259-2 is slave*/
        outb    %al,$0xA1
        i8259delay
        movb    $0x01,%al               /*! 8086 mode for both*/
        outb    %al,$0x21
        i8259delay
        outb    %al,$0xA1
        i8259delay
        movb    $0xFF,%al               /*! mask off all interrupts for
now*/
        outb    %al,$0xA1
        i8259delay
        movb    $0xFB,%al               /*! mask all irq's but irq2
which*/
        outb    %al,$0x21               /*! is cascaded*/
