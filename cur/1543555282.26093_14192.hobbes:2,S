  I think the only problem is that some people may rely on this behaviour.
There isn't probably any other reason as races with quotaoff before
someone does write are there even if we do quotaoff in kernel.
And these races aren't probably worth the work with fixing...
  But I'm not sure whether we can just now stand up and say 'Umount doesn't
do quotaoff any more...'
