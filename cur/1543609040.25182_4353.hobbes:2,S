Enough! Please!
Linus, as many a craftsman of old, has taken to putting a tiny
blemish into each of his final releases: partly as a signature
to distinguish them from Alan's, yes, but more importantly to
avoid attracting the wrath of jealous gods by the perfection
of his releases.  But it is unseemly that _we_ should keep on
drawing attention to this blemish.
In silence, delete the two calls to deactivate_page from your loop.c.
