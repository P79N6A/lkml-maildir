Thanks, but I already did a very similar patch myself

i386: Fix K8/core2 oprofile on multiple CPUs
Only try to allocate MSRs once instead of for every CPU.
This assumes the MSRs are the same on all CPUs which is currently
true. P4-HT is a special case for different SMT threads, but the code 
always saves/restores all MSRs so it works identical.
