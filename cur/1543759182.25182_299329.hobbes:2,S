I'm a casual user, and I'm happy to bang on the latest (-mm) kernels
so long as my data doesn't get corrupted. But the process of
downloading, patching, configuring, compiling, and installing a new
kernel is a bit of a pain, requiring user intervention a number of
times. It's enough that I don't update very often.
I've just done a bit of looking for scripts to automate the process of
installing a new kernel, and I haven't come up with much of much. So
right now I'm writing my own. If there are tools to help automate this
they need to be more prominent on www.kernel.org and
www.kernelnewbies.org, to make casual testing even easier.
