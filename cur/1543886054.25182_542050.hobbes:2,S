BTW, the crypto layer's scatterlist already has a chaining mechanism
using the existing structure.  The only difference is that the chained
pointer is stored inside the 'struct page *' rather than a new pointer.
Its existence is flagged by a zero value in the length field.
Now I'm not super-religious about this but we should at least consider
whether forking out 4 bytes in every scatterlist member is worthwhile
investment when we can use 12 bytes at the end instead.
Cheers,
