Yes, it also increased the lifetimes by meaningful values: first re-accessed
pages are prolonged more lifetime. Immediately removing them from inactive_list 
is basicly doing MRU eviction.

Delayed activation increased scanning activity, while immediate activation
increased the locking activity. Early profiling data on a 2 CPU Xeon box showed
that the delayed activation acctually cost less time.

Yeah, the patch does need more testing. 
It has been in -ck tree for a while, and there's no negative report about it.
Andrew, and anyone in the lkml, do you feel ok to test it in -mm tree?
It is there because some readahead code test the PG_actvation bit explicitly.
If the answer is 'not for now', I'll strip it out from the readahead patchset
in the next version.
Thanks,
Wu
