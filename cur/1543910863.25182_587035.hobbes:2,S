Subject: huge improvement with per-device dirty throttling

I tested 2.6.23-rc2-mm + Peter's per-BDI v9 patches, versus 2.6.20 as
shipped in Ubuntu 7.04.  I realize there is a large delta between these
two kernels.
I load the system with du -hs /bigtree, where bigtree has millions of
files, and dd if=/dev/zero of=bigfile bs=1048576.  I test how long it
takes to ls /*, how long it takes to launch gnome-terminal, and how long
it takes to launch firefox.
2.6.23-rc2-mm-bdi is better than 2.6.20 by a factor between 50x and
100x.
1.
sleep 60 && time ls -l /var /home /usr /lib /etc /boot /root /tmp
2.6.20: 53s, 57s
2.6.23: .652s, .870s, .819s
improvement: ~70x
2.
sleep 60 && time gnome-terminal
2.6.20: 1m50s, 1m50s
2.6.23: 3s, 2s, 2s
improvement: ~40x
3.
sleep 60 && time firefox
2.6.20: >30m
2.6.23: 30s, 32s, 37s
improvement: +inf
Yes, you read that correctly.  In the presence of a sustained writer and
a competing reader, it takes more than 30 minutes to start firefox.
4.
du -hs /bigtree
Under 2.6.20, lstat64 has a mean latency of 75ms in the presence of a
sustained writer.  Under 2.6.23-rc2-mm+bdi, the mean latency of lstat64
is only 5ms (15x improvement).  The worst case latency I observed was
more than 2.9 seconds for a single lstat64 call.
Here's the stem plot of lstat64 latency under 2.6.20

In other words, under 2.6.20, only writing processes make progress.
Readers never make progress.
5.
dd writeout speed
2.6.20: 36.3MB/s, 35.3MB/s, 33.9MB/s
2.6.23: 20.9MB/s, 22.2MB/s
2.6.23 is slower when writing out, because other processes make progress
My system is a Core 2 Duo, 2GB, single SATA disk.
