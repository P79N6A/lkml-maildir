So do I :) I'm not the one who makes the final decision ;)

Thank you for additional testing on enterprise servers!
Hope this will be a good argument in favour of the patches.

That's right. I made some small testing which showed
that moving this pointer in a mirrored array saves less
than 0.1% of performance on 4CPU i386 node. I don't know
how this will be on enterprise hardware, but I do believe
that the results will be the same (or even better).
