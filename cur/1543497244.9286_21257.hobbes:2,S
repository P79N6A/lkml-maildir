the lilo shipped in 6.0 has a smaller size limit for non bzImages than
previous lilos. bzimages are loaded into 'high' memory, but non bzimages
are loaded into the usual 640k range.  they're allowed to step on less
memory to make room for certain BIOSes that store data in the ebda
(extended bios data area).
see the kernel's setup.S, lilo's lilo.h, and the 6.0 lilo srpm's
large-edba patch for more info.
