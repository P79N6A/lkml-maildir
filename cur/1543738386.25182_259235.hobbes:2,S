	Note that it says *would* not block, not *will* not block. The definition
of the word "would" is "an expression of probability or likelihood" (or a
"presumption or expectation"). This is *not* a guarantee.

	I don't draw that conclusion from that paragraph. It does say the presence
of normal data shall mark the socket readable, but it doesn't require the
kernel to keep that data available, at least not as far as I can see.
	As far as I can tell, neither of these two excerpts prohibit an
implementation from, for example, discarding UDP data (say, to save memory)
after it triggered a read hit on a 'select' call. Yes, the 'recvmsg' call
would not have blocked, had it been made at the time the data was available.
