I've been reading the thread regarding data corruption with 2.4.0-test12,
reiserfs, and smp.
Unfrotunately I've not seen any resolution announced about this. Is this
still an issue or has this been fixed?
Right now I've stayed with 2.4.0-test10 + reiserfs and Uni mode while
waiting for a resolution to this.
Anyone know the current status of this problem?
