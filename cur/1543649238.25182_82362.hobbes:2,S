I thought it could be one of the INQUIRY related commands to get the
id/serial numbers, since in your (previous) dmesg output, the failure
occured after the print_inquiry() call on the same target before any
upper level attaches.
But now you are getting nothing at all, not even any of the print_inquiry()
output? 
Like you got just before the failures in your original message:
Vendor: CONNER    Model: CFP2107E  2.14GB  Rev: 1423
Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Vendor: SEAGATE   Model: SX423451W         Rev: 9E18
Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Can you turn on all scsi logging - with CONFIG_SCSI_LOGGING enabled,
on your boot command line add a "scsi_logging=1" and send
the output.
