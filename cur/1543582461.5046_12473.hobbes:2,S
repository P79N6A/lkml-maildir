Hello Rik,
my maschine has spent the entire week-end running memtest86. It ran for
over 60 hours with all tests and it finished 3 passes with 0 errors.
Here's one more interesting aspect about the behaviour I'm seeing:
with 256 MB RAM:
<= 2.2.18: > 7 days, crashes randomly, no pattern.
>= 2.2.19pre2: 1 hour. Crashes as soon as I start hylafax daemon,
reproducable.
with 512 MB RAM
<= 2.2.18: same behaviour as with 2.4.1
2.4.1: Stands up 1 day, crashes as soon as arekeia has started the
backup (happend twice, second oopses included in my last mail)
Is there anything I can do? Is my problem kernel related? I believe
somehow it is. Is my maschine busted?
Any help appreciates
