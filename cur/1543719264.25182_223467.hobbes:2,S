No. Ideally the interactivity bonus should decide what goes first every time 
to decrease the latency of interactive tasks, but the cpu percentage should 
remain close to the same for equal "nice" tasks. Interactive tasks need low 
scheduling latency and short bursts of high cpu usage; not more cpu usage 
overall. When the cpu percentage differs significantly from this the logic 
has failed.
