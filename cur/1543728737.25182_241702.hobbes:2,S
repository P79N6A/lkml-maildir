Hi Greg;
Thanks for the response, things seem to be working now.
I'm still a little fuzzy about how all this works together, but the
picture is starting to become a bit clearer.  Here are the basic steps I
took in my PCI driver to get the device node to show up, please let me
know if anyone sees an error here:
In the init module function, I create a new class_simple pointer:
static struct class_simple *myclass;
int init_module( void )
{
~    ...
~    myclass = class_simple_create( THIS_MODULE, "myclassname" );
~    ...
}
This causes the new class directory to show up under /sys/class
In the PCI probe function I do the following:
probe(...)
{
~   ...
~   // Allocate a device numer
~   dev_t mydev;
~   alloc_chrdev_region( &mydev, 0, 1, "mydevicename" );
~   // Add this device number to my class.  Note I'm passing NULL for
~   // the device pointer.  I'm not exactly sure what this is for, but
~   // most devices in the kernel tree seem to pass NULL here.
~   class_simple_add_device( myclass, mydev, NULL, "mydevicename" );
~   // Finally, I init and add my cdev structure.
~   cdev_init( &mycdev, &myfops );
~   mycdev.owner = THIS_MODULE;
~   kobject_set_name( &mycdev.kobj, "mydevicename" );
~   cdev_add( &mycdev, mydev, 1 );
~   ...
}
Of course, my real code has error checking and does cleanup in the PCI
remove function and the module exit function.
Thanks again!
Steve
