Do you have a test case?
IIRC we had that bug, and it was fixed by adding PIPE_WCOUNTER:
PIPE_WRITERS counts the number of writers. This one is decreased during 
close(). PIPE_WCOUNTER counts how often a writer was seen. It's never 
decreased. Readers that wait for a writer wait until PIPE_WCOUNTER 
changes, they do not look at PIPE_WRITERS.
