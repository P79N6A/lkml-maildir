Subject: Lost Master control on MSI 645?

I found that I lost the Master control on my mixer (alsamixer) with 2.6.3. I see
that an ac97_quirk (linux/sound/pci/intel8x0.c) had been added for an "MSI P4 ATX
645 Ultra" motherboard. I have an MSI 645E Max-U (MS-6547) (v2.1) Motherboard and
it seems to trigger this. The quirk tries to move the headphone output control to
the master control. Unfortunately, my motherboard doesn't have a headphone control
so this just removes my Master control. This patch checks to see if the headphone
control exists before removing the master control. With this patch, my Master
control shows up again...
