So you are indeed trying to control the value of argv[0]? Well, good luck with 
that, but it's totally insane. You are guaranteed to break some applications. 
AppArmor is not going to go down that route.
If /bin/cat and /bin/rm are binaries or hardlinks to the same busybox binary 
(rather than symlinks), different profiles could be used for each of them. 
The cat profile could have no more than read access anywhere, so this would 
prevent it from removing files. That's an effective access control mechanism.
Conspiring with busybox in the kernel and making it do the right thing (and 
just that) at the application level is not an effective security mechanism: 
the kernel would still allow busybox to do anything, and there could be bugs 
in the application, busybox's calling convention could change to allow more 
than one command per invocation (e.g., ``cat /etc/shadow ; rm /etc/shadow''), 
etc.
