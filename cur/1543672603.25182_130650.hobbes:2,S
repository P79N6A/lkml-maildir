It also matters if people writing applications for embedded systems
have a fetish for many threads. 1000 threads, each eating 8k memory
for pure existance (no actual work done yet), do put some memory
pressure on small machines. Yes, it would be possible to educate those
people, but changing kernel code is more fun and less work.
