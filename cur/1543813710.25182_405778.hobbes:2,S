Subject: [ANNOUNCE][RFC] dynsched-0.1.1 for  2.6.13
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello,
there is a new version of dynsched released. It includes some minor
bugfixes and code cleanups. we are looking forward to your suggestions
and we are highly interested in a discussion.
In the next step we will port the patch to the current plugsched version
and split the patch in a plugsched part and a dynsched part.
The "dynsched" project aims switching the CPU scheduler at runtime. Its
based upon the "plugsched" patch by Peter Williams
(
http://cpuse.sourceforge.net/
). Increments to plugsched especially
a kthread, wich switchs between different schedulers, in sched.c and a
proc user interface. 
Following scheduler implementations are currently supported:
* ingosched
* nicksched
* staircase
There are some missing functions like converting task_struct between the
schedulers. First tests on kernel 2.6.13.5 and 2.6.13.4
were successful. The spa based schedulers (such as spa_no_frills, zaphod
etc) are not yet supported. I hope they will be finished soon, just as
SMP support.
There is an alpha patch available at project site -
https://sourceforge.net/projects/dynsched
Using the procfs you can switch between the linux standard scheduler
(ingosched), nicksched and staircase schedulers by simply issuing: 
echo "name_of_the_scheduler" > /proc/dynsched
There have been successful tests to switch the cpu scheduler while
running a fully loaded Linux system, running a KDE Desktop with a lot of
applications.
