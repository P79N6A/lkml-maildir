I have a problem that has manifested itself since 2.4.19-rcx.
An ADSL driver (1483-2.4.16.o) for the DLINK dsl100d PCI ADSL modem
operational under 2.4.18 has been broken since 2.4.19,
specifically under rc3,rc4 and rc5. (Haven't tested rc2 or rc1)
It appears to get/interpret an incorrect hardware address from the card.
There is a constraint. The driver was originally compiled for ITEX/DLINK
under 2.4.16 and I don't have access to the source.
The only known location of this driver is
http://www.nzadsl.co.nz/software/other/Kernel-2.4.16.tar.gz
and it is not strictly a DLINK driver, more a creation for itex.
For reference I use
inmod -f ./1483-2.4.16.o vpi=[8][0] vci=35 framing=1
then
ifconfig eth1 up (yes there is an eth0 card) This fails with the message
SIOCSIFFLAGS: No such device.
Short of rolling back to 2.4.18 which isn't a problem, any advice anyone?
Cheers,
Bruce Stephens.
