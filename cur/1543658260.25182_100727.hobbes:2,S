This will fail to compile on gcc-2.91.66.  It's OK on 2.95.3.
sparc64 requires a compiler of similar vintage (2.92.11), so
I am trying to keep 2.91.66-on-x86 limping along so that breakage
can be detected more easily.
Please use
	#define adjust_jiffies(x...) do {} while (0)
here.   Or an empty inline, which tends to be nicer, because you
still get argument type checking.
