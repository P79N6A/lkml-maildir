I would like to add that I have nearly the same setup with the exception of
an adaptec card and RAID5 instead of RAID1, and it's rock solid. I never had
an oops nor a crash on it and it's my file server. So if it was a RAID1 bug,
it does not affect RAID5 (unlikely). Thus, I too think it's related to the
SCSI driver.
