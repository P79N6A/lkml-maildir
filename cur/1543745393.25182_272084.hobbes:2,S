Actually, orinoco_usb in current Orinoco CVS has support for some of
these devices and I'm using one right now. The driver works pretty well
but I'm not sure whether orinoco_usb supports many prism2_usb devices
the same way orinoco_cs supports many prism2_cs devices.
So, if I sent you my wireless device it wouldn't be much help :)
