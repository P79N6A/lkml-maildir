Hi,
  I sent message below to linux-fsdevel yesterday, but I received no
feedback. Meanwhile I also created patch which does changes proposed
below (map 0x80-0x9F to unicode 0x80-0x9F for ISO encodings).
Patch is available at 
http://platan.vc.cvut.cz/nls3.patch
 (39KB).
  If I'll not receive any feedback, I plan to send it to Linus soon.
Currently if you'll mount NCP filesystem with accented characters
without proper iocharset/codepage options, you'll not see filenames
with accented characters at all, as they will not pass through
char2uni of default (iso8859-1) NLS (there was warning printk,
but it was way to DoS...).
  I do not want to use way SMB does (map unknown characters to
:x## string) as it is not trivial to map them back. But if you
think that it is correct that some NLS tables contain characters
without unicode equivalents...
					Thanks,

Subject:       NLS mappings for iso-8859-* encodings
X-Mailing-List: 	linux-fsdevel@vger.kernel.org
Hi,
  today it was pointed to me (see Debian bugreport #145654,
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=145654
) that
all nls_iso8859-* mappings available in kernel refuse to map
characters in range 0x80-0x9F to anything reasonable.
  This behavior means, that with NLS default set to any of
iso8859-* encoding (including default iso-8859-1) filesystems
which contain data in cp850/852/437 codepages will have bad
problems, as majority of accented characters live in 0x80-0x9F
range in these codepages.
  And worse is that old 2.2.x kernels defaulted to 1:1 mapping,
so people were used to see wrong accented characters, but all filenames.
Now they see nothing :-( 
  Is there any reason why 0x80-0x9F range is not mapped identically
to 0x80-0x9F unicode range? I believe that unicode is even defined
as having first 256 characters identical to iso8859-1.
                                                Thanks,
                                                    Petr Vandrovec
