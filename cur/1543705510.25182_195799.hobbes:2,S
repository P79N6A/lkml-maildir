Are we talking about the same x86_64?
I see this in arch/x86_64/vsyscall.S:
__kernel_vsyscall:
.LSTART_vsyscall:
	push	%ebp
.Lpush_ebp:
	movl	%ecx, %ebp
	syscall
Is that page not mapped into userspace?
If the answer is no, then btw we were talking about i386 until you joined in. :)
The "sysenter" instruction is definitely mapped into userspace there.
