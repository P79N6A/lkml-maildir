   AFAIK there exists at least two proprietary ext2fs drivers for Windows NT. 
   I would like to ask if anyone here know about any open source project
   going on to produce such a driver?
Part of the problem is that in order to build an installable filesystem
for Windows NT, you need to get the Microsoft IFS SDK, which is horribly
expensive (approx USD $1000).  So an Open Source project is pretty hard;
you wouldn't be able to recompile from sources without paying $1000 to
Microsoft.
