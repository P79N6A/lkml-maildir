Only thing to remember is that you technically can't go back (i.e. you
can go from BSD to GPL, but not from GPL to BSD).  Not to say going back
to BSD doesn't happen.  Of course most folks don't care as long as it
stays in the OpenSource community (I have seen it and based on some
comments from ESR recently he has seen it to).
