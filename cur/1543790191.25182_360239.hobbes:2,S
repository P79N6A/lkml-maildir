Hello,
Since I upgraded my kernel from 2.6.12.6 to 2.6.13.4 (using make 
oldconfig), I get the following messages at startup:
PCI: Ignore bogus resource 6 [0:0] of 0000:00:02.0
PCI: Failed to allocate I/O resource #7:1000@10000 for 0000:01:01.0
PCI: Failed to allocate I/O resource #8:1000@10000 for 0000:01:01.0
PCI: Bus 2, cardbus bridge: 0000:01:01.0
I have tried "pci=routeirq", but it makes no difference.
When running 2.6.13.4 I cannot use my WLAN card (ndiswrapper).
With 2.6.12.6 there is no problem at all...
Is there something I can try to do? I've attached the lspci logs from 
both kernels.. The computer is a Dell Inspiron 510m laptop.
Thanks!
