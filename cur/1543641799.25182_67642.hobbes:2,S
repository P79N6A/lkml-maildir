But you'll need to modify the declaration of the various function
pointers whose implementations might need credentials and modify all
functions that call them and deal with permissions.
Instead with my proposal the credentials are automatically immutable
across the syscall without needing to worry at all about locks, counts
and sharing.
And remember that passing parameters has a cost since you need to push
them and the stack will be larger, occupy more cachelines, and thus
cause more cache misses.
All this without any particular reason to do since normally the
credentials are always the same.
Of course, if you have reason to think that we'll need to call VFS
functions with a lot of differential credential then you are right, but
otherwise you would add just a lot of useless overhead and code
modifications.
