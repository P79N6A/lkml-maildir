I don't want to touch the rest of the thread, but the best info on the
above can be found in the linux-audio-user list archives.  It's still a
little unclear exactly which packages are required, but IIRC PAM 0.80
supports it already.  I believe this requires glibc changes eventually,
but programs like PAM and bash that deal with rlimits can work around it
if glibc is not aware of the new rlimit.
Personally I still use the old realtime LSM, until this is all worked
out.
