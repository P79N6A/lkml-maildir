The reason why all routes are deleted is because their prefered
source addresses is the primary address. fn_flush_list should
probably send the missing notifications for the deleted routes.
Changing address promotion to not delete the other routes at all
looks extremly complicated, I think just fixing it to behave
correctly is good enough (which my patch didn't do entirely,
I'll send a new one this weekend).
