/usr/bin/time reports the info, yes.
It's useful for tuning the scheduler, and when developing and tuning
posix thread apps. 
I wanted to know if the work I did on adding preemption support to IA64
actually made much difference in the number of involuntary context
switches.  It doesn't, at least on the measurements I've made so far.
I'm actually intested in getting most of the rusage fields filled in
properly, at least the ones that make sense for Linux.
Things to do are:
       -- Track maxrss and report it.
       -- Track and integrate rss.
       -- Fix the page fault accounting (currently some minor faults
          are counted as major faults)
       -- add signal accounting
Block I/O isn't that important -- it almost all goes through the page
cache anyway, and it's a bit difficult to assign a particular I/O to a
particular process.  Likewise, message I.O isn't that important AFAIK.
The stack, data and unshared data sizes aren't currently
accounted for separately at all, so it'd be a bit difficult to track
the integral of those numbers.
