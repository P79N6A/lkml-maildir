No, given that all module_param() options are available via the boot
command line when the module is linked into vmlinux, we don't document them
separately.
There should be a way of auto-generating all the documentation for all the
module parameters from their MODULE_PARM_DESC's.  And there probably is,
but I'm not sure how this is done (?)
(does `make help', fails to spot it).
You can do `modinfo loop' but that probably doesn't work if
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP=y?
I assume you tested the "loop.max_part=N" option?
