If it makes linked lists impossible, it's going about things the wrong  
way.

The really hard part is the stuff about sequence points and how they make  
for undefined behaviour. I gather the C0X draft currently has an appendix  
that has a somewhat formal for exactly this.

I'm not quite sure if you think it's going to find too many or too few  
bugs.
Anyway, as anyone who's done mathematical proofs knows, you don't really  
need the fully general thing anyway. That's what you have a programmer  
for. You tell the thing what is supposed to happen, and the thing verifies  
that this is indeed what happens, or otherwise tells you that it can't  
figure this out and you'll have to look for yourself.
Currently, you have to control _everything_. With such a tool, you should  
be able to reduce this to very few parts of a program.
It's far easier to check a few small routines than to check all of a big  
program. Just as it's easier to verify that a call to snprintf gives the  
right buffer size, and that snprintf does the right thing with a buffer  
size, than that a call to sprintf will never overflow a buffer.
In fact, good advice for writing security-critical code is to design  
interfaces to avoid these problems in the first place.
If you absolutely must have variable-sized buffers, always have a buffer  
length in the parameter list. Better would be to only handle a buffer  
descriptor around that points to a buffer the called routine can adjust  
the size of as needed - has the added benefit of avoiding hardcoded  
maximum sizes.

Also because, while there was a free gcc, there wasn't a free lint for  
quite a long time.
