But it looks fairly good on the other hand. The Panacom is a
'Communication' class device, and thus has to be handled via the table.
But the Sealevel and 3Com both say they are 'Serial - 16550' class and
prog-if. For these, using all i/o regions as serial ports will work
just fine. I checked the current table, they don't need any extra init
and SPCI_FL_BASE_TABLE is defined for them, and they have 115200 base
baud. I think the same is true for most of the modems.
So, this is good and speaks in favor of the generic support.
