  You have to handle NFSv3 serving to non Linux clients. And as I said the
  obvious approach is to lie and claim to be using 12:20
  
  
i think we're mixing up the pov of /dev/ for the server and then for
the client in the same argument.
for a linux client with devfs, it doesn't need to nfs mount any /dev,
it's builtin like /proc. a server can export a standard filesystem
type /dev over nfs to clients, irregardless of what kind of /dev it's
using.
So where's the problem? Also, AFAIK, the split thing is transparent
to devfs. (maybe richard can confirm this).
devfs is a good thing. I and all the rest who have tried it and use
it regularly think so. It's compatible, it's clean, it eliminates
/dev admin maintenance. And it works really well.
When will it be included? And if there are problems to it's
inclusion, what are they, so that a solution can be found.
