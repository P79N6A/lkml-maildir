The question is, of course, whether you're willing to bet the entire
chemical plant on the chances of a packet being lost.
There's a difference between "if the core temperature hits 350
degrees, the pump WILL go on in 13 milliseconds" and "if the core temp
hits 350 degrees, the pump will have a 98% chance of going on sometime
between 13 and 17.5 milliseconds..."
