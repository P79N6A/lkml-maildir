Is the signature not derived from the bits in the GPLed component, as
much as it is derived from the key?
Isn't the signature is a functional portion of the image, i.e., if I
take it out from the system, it won't work any more?

Not really.  It could take some explicit distinguishing between
functional and non-functional signatures, but that's about it.
GPLv3 chose a different path to make this clarification.
