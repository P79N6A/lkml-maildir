The intent of the "access" call is to tell you if you will be able to
open the given pathname for the requested permissions. That this is
inherently racey is not the fault of the access system call.
The INTENT of this paragraph from the standard is to specify when to
return the error value EROFS. The "for a -=file=-" part to me
indicates that a valid interpretation is that this does not apply to
device nodes.
