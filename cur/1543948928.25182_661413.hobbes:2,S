    [XFS] If you mount an XFS filesystem with no mount options at all, then
    the "ikeep" option is set rather than "noikeep".
    
    This regression was introduced in 970451.
    
    With no mount options specified, xfs_parseargs() does the following:
    
    int ikeep = 0;
    
    args->flags |= XFSMNT_BARRIER;
    
    args->flags2 |= XFSMNT2_COMPAT_IOSIZE;
    
    if (!options)
    
    goto done;
    
    It only sets the above two options by default and before, it also used to
    set XFSMNT_IDELETE by default.
    
    If options are specified, then
    
    if (!(args->flags & XFSMNT_DMAPI) && !ikeep)
    
    args->flags |= XFSMNT_IDELETE;
    
    is executed later on which is skipped by the "goto done;" above.
    
    The solution is to invert the logic.
