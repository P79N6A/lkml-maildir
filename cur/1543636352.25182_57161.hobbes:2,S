Any dump on a live f/s would seem to have the problem that files are
changing as they are read and may not be consistant. I suppose there
could be some kind of "fsync and journal lock" on a file, allowing all
writes to a file to be journaled while the file is backed up. However,
such things don't scale well for big files with lots of writes, and the
file, while unchanging, may not be valid.
Backups of running files are best done by the application, like Oracle
as a for-instance. Neither the o/s nor the backup can be sure when/if
the data is in a valid state.
Tar has this problem, although not the same issues with data on the fly
in buffers.
