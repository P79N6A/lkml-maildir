At least in Linux we don't really work with deadlines; if there 
are issues they need to be fixed even if it takes longer. I don't 
expect the version in .21 to be really usable anyways; it is clearly
still in development.

It shouldn't touch the hypervisor, just the paravirt VMI backend shouldn't it?
I assume you could do a very minimal APIC layer that is just enough to 
talk to your softapic and a genapic backend for IPIs.
At least I would welcome anything that shrinks the number of 
paravirt hooks.
I'm just not sure it would be less hooks: you would probably need
functions to start other CPUs at least.
I must admit I also didn't quite get what was the big problem with
hooking apic_read/apic_write.
For the timer you just need to use a own exclusive 
clocksource that never touches PIT.

If you don't enable them they should be already disabled as default 
state, shouldn't they? 
With an own custom clocksource and possible own APIC layer nobody
would ever enable the APICs.

What do you mean with rewrite? It's quite easy to add a new
backend to the generic IRQ code. They aren't a lot of code.

If you used an own APIC layer APIC would never get control at all.

You could probably do a much simpler version, couldn't you? A lot of 
the stuff in apic.c/io_apic.c shouldn't be needed for a clean virtual
interface. But yes it would probably be still a lot of code.
Still (2) is probably best for now, but the other alternatives
are not as ridiculous as you paint them.
