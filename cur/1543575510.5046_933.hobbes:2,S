be GX2 is not supported.

	I'm using XF86_SVGA and it seems the s3v driver in 3.3.* and
may be 4.0.* (as mentioned in the xfree-xpert list) has problem with
the right usage of the accel FIFO for the GX2 cards. Not sure for
your S3Trio32/64 card. It seems the faster CPU and the AGP speed hits the
problem. I see some problems in the image (some dots are missing from
different letters, sometimes).
	regs3v.h approximates the loop to 6 seconds:
#define MAXLOOP 0xffffff /* timeout value for engine waits, ~6 secs */
	For my CPU the lockup takes 4.8 seconds. Not sure why they are
sometimes infinite.
	So, I'm leaving this mail list, it seems this is a s3v driver
problem.
