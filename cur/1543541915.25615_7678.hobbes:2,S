It does - that's the point.

Netatalk does, apparently. HFS forks are certainly accessible to userspace
without ANY changes to the API.

Off-hand, I don't know of any code which uses them. The NTFS driver could
certainly allow access to them without ANY VFS or API changes at all,
though, as I have explained before.

HFS and NTFS, yes: no changes needed at all. HPFS's EAs aren't a concept
VFS was really designed to handle; again, though, the HPFS driver can
allow userspace to access EAs as a block of data via VFS without any API
changes at all.

It can be done, and in HFS's case already is. No API change needed.

Agreed.
