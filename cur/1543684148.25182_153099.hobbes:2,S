I've the confirmation it was reproduced on x86, so the timer should have
been running in the same cpu where it was queued (i.e. the base should
have been the same for both del_timer_sync and add_timer). So at the
moment it's not clear what race that patch fixed, but nevertheless I
feel much safer to keep this obviously safe additional locking applied
until we know for sure ;) And I've the confirmation that it makes the
2.4 kernel stable again.
FYI, if I don't answer to further emails on this in the next days, it's
because I'll be on vacations the next 14 days.
