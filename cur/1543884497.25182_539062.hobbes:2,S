Here is how I think the future could develop
Cycle	SLAB		SLUB		SLOB		SLxB
2.6.22	API fixes	Stabilization	API fixes
Major event: SLUB availability as experimental
2.6.23	API upgrades	Perf. Valid.	EOL
Major events: SLUB performance validation. Switch off
	experimental (could even be the default) 
	Slab allocators support targeted reclaim for at
	least one slab cache (dentry?)
	(vacate/move all objects in a slab)
2.6.24	Earliest EOL	Stable		- 		Experiments
Major events: SLUB stable. Stable targeted reclaim
		for all major reclaimable slabs.
		Maybe experiments with another new allocator?
2.6.25	EOL		default		-		?
Death of SLAB. SLUB default. Hopefully new ideas on the horizon.
