I asked myself why this problem never happened before. So I asked our testers
to reproduce this problem on 2.6.23 and service levels. As the testcase did
not trigger, I looked into the 2.6.23 code. This problem was introduced by
commit 4a9e5ef1f4f15205e477817a5cefc34bd3f65f55 (mm: write iovec cleanup from
Nick Piggin) during 2.6.24-rc:
--------snip-------
-		copied = filemap_copy_from_user(page, offset, buf, bytes);
[...]
+		copied = bytes -
+			__copy_from_user_inatomic_nocache(kaddr, buf, bytes);

So yes, its good to have xip on brd. It even tests your changes ;-)
Good news is, that we dont need anything for stable.
