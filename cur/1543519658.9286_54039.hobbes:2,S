The Intel Assembly Language Reference Manual states that the sti
instruction sets the interrupt flag to 1 and the CPU then responds
to external interrupts after executing the *next* instruction if the
next instruction allows the interrupt to remain enabled.  So the
wakeup can only happen _after_ the hlt which is the desired effect.
I have implemented the above patch and tested overnight with no
more problems due to the idle task.
