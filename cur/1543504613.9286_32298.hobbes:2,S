Subject: Zida 6MLX Motherboard rebooting spontaneously

I have a Zida 6MLX motherboard which uses the Intel LX chipset.
It has a PII 266 processor in it.  It uses an AMI BIOS.
When I run Linux on this machine it reboots spontaneously.
This happens for all kernels I have tried - 2.0.36, 2.2.9, 2.2.4 various
2.1.x
The first time it boots up it will reboot somewhere during the startup
scripts.
After this the machine will stay up longer but will eventually reboot it
self after around 1-2 minutes of being up.
If I disable the Processor Cache in the BIOS the machine is fine (although
very slow!).
Windows 95 and Windows NT run fine on this machine so I suspect it is not a
hardware fault.  I have tested the memory with memtest86 and it checks out
fine.
I thought it could be due to a poor quality power supply in the case, with
the initial surge of everything powering up causing it to fail but then I
don't understand why other operating systems work ok.
Does any one have any ideas on this?  Anyone got a 6MLX mboard working under
Linux?
Also when initialising PIIX4 the kernel says "not in 100% native mode will
probe IRQs later".  What does this mean?
Thanks,
From Tom
