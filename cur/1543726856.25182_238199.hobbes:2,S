Hello,
	I have a nforce2 motherboard. I have to report that recent changes in usb 
code make my board don't work at all.
	In 2.6.7-mm7, I just reverted the bk-usb.patch and the things started to 
work, but now it's on mainstream, so I cannot make it work.
	Do you want for me to do some tests?
Thanks.
