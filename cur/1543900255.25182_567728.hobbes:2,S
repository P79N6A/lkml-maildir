1) talk to the administrators and convince them to allow you to use
gmails SMTP/POP feature with a different MUA so you don't have to use
the web interface.
2) If you have a box available at home (or elsewhere), use that to
relay mail through.
3) Use attachments for patches (sucks, but you may have to).
