Basically, there's the "slow" timer, and the fast one. The slow one always
runs, and fast one gives the precision but runs at CPU speed.
So yes, there are multiple oscillators, and no, they should not drift on
frequency shifting, because the slow and constant one is used to scale the
fast one. So no cumulative errors.
HOWEVER, anybody who believes that TSC is a "truly accurate clock" will be
sadly mistaken on any machine. Even PLL's drift over time, and as
mentioned, Intel already broke the "you can use TSC as wall time" in their
SpeedStep implementation. Who knows what their future CPU's will do..

It will work on Crusoe.

We do that, but the other way around. The thing is, the "nominal clock
speed" doesn't even _exist_ when running normally.
What does exist is the bus clock (well, a multiple of it, but you get the
idea), and that one is stable. I bet PCI devices don't like to be randomly
driven at frequencies "somewhere between 12 and 33MHz" depending on load ;)
But because the stable frequency is the _slow_ one, you can't just scale
that up (well, you could - you could just run your cycle counter at 66MHz
all the time, and you couldn't measure smaller intervals, and people would
be really disappointed). So you need the scaling of the fast one..
