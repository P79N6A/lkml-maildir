Actually, no, it is not implicit.  The spec clearly states that the
brightness values will be cycled through the ones given by that list.  It is
implicit that brightness up actions will cycle through the list in order,
and brightness down will cycle through the list in reverse order.
If a vendor where to decide to place the most used brightness values in the
beginning of the list, and the rest of it later, he would be allowed to do
so.  Nobody was weird enough to do it yet though, AFAIK.
