That would be nice to have in sysfs, I agree.

Yeah, this isn't that hard right now.  Just create a new struct device
for every card, point the parent of this new device to the device that
represents the card, and then point the other different sound specific
devices to the new card.
Hm, let me go hack at it and see what I come up with, code is so much
better for an example...
