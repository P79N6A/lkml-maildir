The MHz value in /proc/cpuinfo should be updated as the CPU speed
changes - that is, it is not calculated just at boot, but it is updated
as the speed actually changes.
You probably have some issue in your power management scripts - Fedora
should scale the CPU speed back as soon as you remove AC power, not just
at boot if not on AC.
