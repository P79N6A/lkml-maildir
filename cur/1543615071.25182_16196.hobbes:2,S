I'm not sure that entering this debate is a good idea, but it is 
so sad to see two such valuable contributers to Linux bicker
with each other...
On the infrequent occasion that I had to exchange email with Andre,
I've realized it is very hard to communicate with him (sorry Andre),
so I understand how Jens must be feeling.
On the other hand - and that may just be my problem, as I don't claim 
to have enough expertise - I've read Suparna's and Jens' notes, 
reviewed the code changes and still don't understand where the 
whole ide/scsi/block/char i/o re-design is going. (I can see what has 
been done - that's well documented, but not what's coming or why - a 
discussion of the decomposition in layers, what is each' responsibility
and what's the api between them, simplifications/improvements that
result)
Likewise, I've not been able to discern from Andre's posts what it is
he's trying to do. No idea how that violates what Jens wants.
But Andre is clearly an unrivaled expert in his area, and the recent
results posted to this list are impressive, so I understand that
Andre feels frustrated not to be able to get those improvements into
the kernel.
As a linux user, I certainly want the benefit of what both parties have 
to offer. It would have to satisfy Linus' taste, fit Jens' design, and 
realize Andre's improvements. There ought to be a way for that to happen.
Now, if only I was smart enough to figure that one out :-(
