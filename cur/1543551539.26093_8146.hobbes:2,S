Being able to turn ECN on/off for specific routes would be very
useful. Currently we have to turn ECN off for systems connected to
the Internet because there are bad routers out there. But I know
some routes are ok and want the benefit of ECN on them. In future
we should expect to have a situation where increasingly large parts
of the Internet are ECN clean so we would want ECN on by default
but be able to override it for specific routes that are known to
fail.
