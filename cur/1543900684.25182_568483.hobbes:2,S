is there more involved then just start ignoreing device hibernate and just 
useing the device suspend? (although if there is not a workable device 
suspend for a driver, that would answer my question :-)

I agree, a stipped down hibernate kernel can be very small, not allocating 
this memory until it's needed is a step for the final polishing.

I do't understand this statement, this application is just useing the 
standard kernel interfaces (block devices to read/write to disk, network 
devices to read/write to a server, etc). no new interfaces needed.

don't try to get too fancy right now. stick with a simple 'boot hibernate 
kernel, it's userspace looks for an image to resume, and if it doesn't 
find one reboot to the normal system'
I don't know how to do this with grub, but it would be a trivial shell 
script with lilo

he's trying to get fancy again, the best way to speed up the boot of the 
kexec kernel is make it smaller and avoid probing for devices (hotplug 
should NOT be used for normal suspend situations)
