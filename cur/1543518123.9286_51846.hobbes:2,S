Subject: [PATCH] 32-bit UID support for 2.3.30pre7
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello. I have a new version of the 32-bit UID support patches for Linux
2.3.30pre7.
This one should fix the one remaining namespace problem (I hope), and it
rewrites the SysVIPC stuff according to recent suggestions on the list.
It is tested and working on the i386 architecture.
The patches are available at:
http://www.engin.umich.edu/caen/systems/Linux/code/misc/2.3/19991206/
Changes in this version:
	- the uid_t and gid_t types are unchanged, unless __KERNEL__ is
	  defined. It's unpleasant to have to do this, but libc5 used the
	  kernel headers directly to define uid_t and gid_t, and thus the
	  types cannot change unless they are included in kernel code.
	  (thanks to Richard Gooch for pointing this out)
	- __kernel_uid32_t is now defined and used on all architectures.
	  This was the most straightforward way to deal with it.
	- the SysVipc stuff has been rewritten (again) according to
	  Manfred Spraul's suggestion: use a bitflag that is or-ed with
	  the command code given to msgctl(), semctl(), and shmctl(). We
	  now have:
	  #define IPC_64  0x0100
	  and thus, (IPC_STAT | IPC_64), etc. is used to get the new
	  32-bit UID structures.
	  the backwards compatibility is now in functions called:
		copy_msqid_to_user	copy_msqid_from_user
		copy_semid_to_user	copy_semid_from_user
		copy_shmid_to_user	copy_shmid_from_user
check out:
http://www.engin.umich.edu/caen/systems/Linux/code/misc/2.3/19991206/linux-ipc.patch
for more information.
You cannot compile a 32-bit UID glibc against this version of the patch. I
still hope to have a new glibc patch available soon which will compile
with 32-bit UID support against these latest kernel patches, AND will
provide complete backwards compatibility for old non-32-bit UID kernels.
Still untested:
	- all non-i386 architectures
	- all filesystems other than ext2 and nfs
Thanks,
Chris Wing
