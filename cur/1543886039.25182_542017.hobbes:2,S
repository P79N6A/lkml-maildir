With the i386 kernel it's as follows:
active state:            C2
max_cstate:              C8
bus master activity:     00000000
maximum allowed latency: 20000 usec
states:
    C1:                  type[C1] promotion[C2] demotion[--] latency[000] usage[00004550] duration[00000000000000000000]
   *C2:                  type[C2] promotion[--] demotion[C1] latency[010] usage[00813483] duration[00000000023188005661]
