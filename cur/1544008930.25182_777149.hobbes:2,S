This most probably is correct and I got a resume failure with that patch
applied, so it evidently doesn't fix the problem. :-(

I agree.
That said the "don't bother allocating bridging windows for transparent
bridges" patch resulted in the following layout on my box (from /proc/iomem):
88000000-8807ffff : 0000:00:02.1
88080000-88083fff : 0000:00:1b.0
  88080000-88083fff : ICH HD audio
88084000-88087fff : 0000:03:0b.1
88088000-88088fff : 0000:03:0b.0
  88088000-88088fff : yenta_socket
88089000-880897ff : 0000:03:0b.1
  88089000-880897ff : firewire_ohci
88089800-880898ff : 0000:03:0b.3
  88089800-880898ff : mmc0
8808a000-8808afff : Intel Flush Page
8c000000-8fffffff : PCI CardBus 0000:04
90000000-93ffffff : PCI CardBus 0000:04
while my "don't allocate bridging windows for cardbus bridges behind
transparent bridges" patch I've just sent (appended for easier reference)
results in the layout:
88000000-880fffff : PCI Bus 0000:03
  88000000-88003fff : 0000:03:0b.1
  88004000-88004fff : 0000:03:0b.0
    88004000-88004fff : yenta_socket
  88005000-880057ff : 0000:03:0b.1
    88005000-880057ff : firewire_ohci
  88005800-880058ff : 0000:03:0b.3
    88005800-880058ff : mmc0
88100000-8817ffff : 0000:00:02.1
88180000-88183fff : 0000:00:1b.0
  88180000-88183fff : ICH HD audio
88184000-88184fff : Intel Flush Page
8c000000-8fffffff : PCI CardBus 0000:04
90000000-93ffffff : PCI CardBus 0000:04
where devices behind the transparent bridge (PCI Bus 0000:03) are located
_before_ ICH HD audio in the memory address space, and this one appears to
work.  So there _may_ be an effect of the layout too.

Well, given that both affected boxes have the same chipset (945GM), I seriously
suspect a nastiness in that chipset we're not aware of.  Especially that
the problem is not reproducible without snd_hda_intel (at least on my box).

Well, I think more fine-grained debugging will be necessary.
I've already checked the resume ordering of PCI devices on my box and it
is the following:
pci:0000:00:00.0
pci:0000:00:02.0 <- graphics
pci:0000:00:02.1 <- graphics
pci:0000:00:1b.0 <- snd_hda_intel
pci:0000:00:1c.0 <- PCI Express port 1
pci:0000:00:1c.2 <- PCI Express port 3
pci:0000:00:1d.0 <- USB UHCI
pci:0000:00:1d.1 <- USB UHCI
pci:0000:00:1d.2 <- USB UHCI
pci:0000:00:1d.3 <- USB UHCI
pci:0000:00:1d.7 <- USB EHCI
pci:0000:00:1e.0 <- transparent bridge (Intel Corporation 82801 Mobile PCI Bridge)
pci:0000:00:1f.0 <- ISA bridge
pci:0000:00:1f.2 <- SATA (ahci)
pci:0000:01:00.0 <- e1000e
No Bus:0000:01
pci:0000:02:00.0 <- wireless (iwlagn)
No Bus:0000:02
pci:0000:03:0b.0 <- cardbus bridge
pci:0000:03:0b.1 <- FireWire
pci:0000:03:0b.3 <- SD Host controller (Texas Instruments)
No Bus:0000:04
No Bus:0000:03
So, snd_hda_intel resumes before all of the bridges and the layout of devices
_behind_ the transparent bridge shouldn't affect it at all.
Thanks,
