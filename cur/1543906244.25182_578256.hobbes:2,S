Hi,
This is an updated series of ALPM patches.  I moved all link power management
stuff out of scsi sysfs and just use the shost_addr pointer in the host
template to create the sysfs files.  This provides the same interface
as before, without requiring any scsi changes.  I also fixed a bug in
the handling of the interrupts for some devices (mostly ATAPI it seems)
which will need some bits out of Serror cleared on power state changes,
and I also modified the code slightly based on feedback from tejun.
please review,
Thanks,
Kristen
