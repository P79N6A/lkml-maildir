I agree with removing completly the i386 i486 i586 i686 and add instead
the "has RDTSC", "has not buggy IOAPIC", "has working wp in supervisor
mode MMU"  etc... config option. I think it's more generic, will not cause
documentation mistakes anymore and will produce more readable code. The
mtrr stuff just follow this good way.
