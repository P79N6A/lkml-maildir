The idea of maintaining them separately is that people won't be able to
touch the ABI without explicitly going through a gatekeeper whose job is
to minimize breakage. Linus usually catches ABI changes but not always.
I explicitly did _not_ suggest making it the job of libc maintainers. And
the whole point of the exercise is to avoid ABI of the day anyway. The ABI
should change less frequently than the kernel or libc. It's more analogous
to something like modutils.
