yes, I agree.  It's really bad to be calling flush_scheduled_work() with
any locks held at all.  Fragile, hard-to-maintain, source of
once-in-a-blue-moon failures, etc.  I guess lockdep will help.
But running flush_scheduled_work() from within dev_close() is a very
sensible thing to do, and dev_close is called under rtnl_lock().
davem is -> thattaway ;)

Ah.  The point is that the phy code doesn't want to flush _all_ pending
callbacks.  It only wants to flush its own one.  And its own one doesn't
take rtnl_lock().
IOW, the phy code has no interest in running some random other subsystem's
callback - it just wants to run its own.  Hence no deadlock.
Maybe the lesson here is that flush_scheduled_work() is a bad function.
It should really be flush_this_work(struct work_struct *w).  That is in
fact what approximately 100% of the flush_scheduled_work() callers actually
want to do.
hmm.
