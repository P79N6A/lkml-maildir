It's ok. Ingo sent you a helpful guide. In it, it covers how to check
out the mm branch; see this part
#
# Check out the latest x86 branch:
#
git-checkout x86/mm
This is the branch that contains all the latest patches. You should *not*
need to patch it further. If your machine fails to boot this branch then
I'll need to roll a debugging patch. Before I do that, I want to be sure
you are testing the right branch.
Thanks for persisting. I know this is a little frustrating.
