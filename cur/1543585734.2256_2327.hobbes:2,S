I'm sorry, I was wrong about gtk-- being hairy enough, and I should have
apologized earler.

Yes, yes.  I guess even Qt won't do the trick either. I know at least one of
the KDE packages will, it uses Qt and if you set compilation options to -O6 it
will grow to ~100MB.
A few years ago when I compiled Mico, that one would make GCC chew up a few
hundred megs as well, if compilation options were set to use heavy
optimization.
But never mind about C++ test cases now...

I just felt that many other parts of the kernel try hard to make it as
inexpensive as possible to use kernel functionality, and that the VM naturally
should do the same (to a reasonable extent, of course, as with the other
layers).
For example, if I use thousands of TCP connections, the network layer folks
have been working hard to ensure that I can actually do that with good
performance.
It would feel "wrong" - I think - if the VM had this special rule that "you can
use MMAP, but if you do it a lot the kernel becomes horribly inefficient".
Especially because it was just proved that such behaviour could be completely
eliminated without a big performance overhead on other more simpler users of
the VM.
It's just my oppinion - of course - but I think it's very nice that under Linux
you can actually use the system calls to do lots of neat tricks (such as the
GCC mmap one, or having a thousand TCP connnections open), without being
penalized too heavily.  Using lots of system calls is not necessarily always
bad design.

But the bad case was a garbage collector in GCC.  The mmap tricks seem like
some you may be inclined to actually use in something like garbage collectors.
Are we sure that the developers of all other garbage collectors out there
foresaw this problem and didn't do mmap tricks ?
When running the Haskell interpreter "Hugs", I see lots of lines like this from
strace:
old_mmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x40017000
But I don't have any "big" haskell codes, so I don't know if Haskell does actually
exhibit the gcc-2.96 pattern too...
Maybe some Haskell / ML / Java folks could comment further on this ?

Or maybe 70x something large for some case we just don't know about yet ?
