If I remember correctly quite a few people had good words to say on
this list about Trident sound cards.  True, this was on Intel and I
attempt to use one of these on Alpha (up2000 SMP, to be more precise).
Outwardly nothing seem to be amiss.  This is how this card is listed
by 'lspci -vv':
00:09.0 Multimedia audio controller: Trident Microsystems 4DWave DX (rev 02)
	Subsystem: Unknown device 1023:2000
	Control: I/O+ Mem+ BusMaster+ SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop-
                                          ParErr- Stepping- SERR- FastB2B-
	Status: Cap+ 66Mhz- UDF- FastB2B- ParErr- DEVSEL=medium
                         	>TAbort- <TAbort+ <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR-
	Latency: 2 min, 5 max, 248 set
	Interrupt: pin A routed to IRQ 23
	Region 0: I/O ports at 8800
	Region 1: Memory at 000000000a800000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
	Capabilities: [48] Power Management version 1
		Flags: PMEClk- AuxPwr- DSI- D1+ D2+ PME-
		Status: D0 PME-Enable- DSel=0 DScale=0 PME-
Apart of a bit strange "Latency: 2 min, 5 max, 248 set" things seem
to look sane (BTW - the lowest non-zero value for latency which one
can try to set with 'setpci', and which will hold, is 8).
There is nothing in drivers included with a kernel which seem to
support this card; therefore I tried ALSA drivers.  Here is what
I see with 'cat' on different entries in /proc/asound:

**** version
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture Driver Version 0.4.1c.
Compiled on Oct 25 1999 for kernel 2.2.13-smp (SMP).
So everything seems to be peachy, right?  The only trouble
is that I am not getting any sound coming from my speakers.
Nothing bad happens but no sound either.  Do I miss something
on a kernel side here?  Any sound advice?  :-)
   Thanks,
   Michal
