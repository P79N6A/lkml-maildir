Fwiw, even though Larry's offered to special-case Alan, (and presumed
that Alan's doesn't work for anyone other than Red Hat), in private
email Larry made it clear _I_ am not allowed to use Bitkeeper.  This
is because I work on scripts which analyse repositories - and even
though I was prepared to limit the scope of that work for a time.
Now I am hardly the high-profile kernel hacker that Alan is.
But that shouldn't matter, should it?
Thanks for not using Word, Alan :)
