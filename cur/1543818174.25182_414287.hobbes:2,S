Hm. Except nobody else seems to have this problem with the pchdtv 3000 card.
And there are plenty of HOWTOs and FAQs online for it. Perhaps nobody else is
trying to use the NTSC tuner on it though.
I'm assuming that if cx88_alsa found any audio devices on the card then it
would create a card1 listed in /proc/asound/cards ? It isn't doing that
currently. Apparently not all cx88 cards provide a mixer interface.
