Not really, sorry.  I usually start at mm.patch when I don't have a clue.
It mm.patch fails then pop off all the x86 patches (down to
git-ipwireless_cs.patch).
If mm.patch doesn't fail then push on all the memory management patches (up
to mm-test-and-set-zone-reclaim-lock-before-starting-cleanup.patch).
Two iterations should get you into the culprit zone.
But please do bisect it.
