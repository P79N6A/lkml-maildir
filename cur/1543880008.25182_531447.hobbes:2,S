I myself was thinking of this as the chance for a much needed 
simplification of the scheduling code and if this can be done with the 
result being "reasonable" it then gives us the basis on which to propose 
improvements based on the ideas of others such as you mention.
As the size of the cpusched indicates, trying to evaluate alternative 
proposals based on the current O(1) scheduler is fraught.  Hopefully, 
this initiative can fix this problem.  Then we just need Ingo to listen 
to suggestions and he's showing signs of being willing to do this :-)

That too.
