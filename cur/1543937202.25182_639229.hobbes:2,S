I'm not sure we're talking about the same problem. What I do is union
mount a write enabled file system like tmpfs over a read only file
system like squashfs.
There's no way to create, modify, or delete files in a squashed file
system; they can be copied up when they're modified; or, they can be
whited out when they're deleted.
Whenever a file is created in the union mount, it necessarily gets
created in tmpfs. When that file gets deleted, it gets whited out which
doesn't make sense because it doesn't exist in the other layer.
This is a problem because over time as files are created, modified, and
deleted whiteout cruft accumulates in the cow layer of the union mount.
Fixing the problem doesn't seem that complex and shouldn't require
searching all the layers of the union mount.
If the union file system simply took note of whether a file was created
in the cow layer because it's new or because it's been modified and
copied up from the read only file system, then it would simply delete
the file in the former case and and use whiteout in the latter.

I don't see how the a "deleted" file in a read only file system could be
re-exposed unless its whiteout in the cow layer was deleted, but that's
really not the issue.
What I'm objecting to is creating the whiteout in the cow layer when the
file didn't get there via a copy up from a read only file system. In
this case there's no worry about re-exposing the deleted file because
it's really deleted.
