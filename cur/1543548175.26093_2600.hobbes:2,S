This is a known problem.  There's a bug with the 3Com Card,
where it gives up transmitting if there are a lot of collisions
in a row.  David Hinds and Andrew Morton have spent some time
on this recently, and it seems to be doing a lot better.
There are still some problems, especially if the card gets
excessively warm (don't ask me why...).  If your network
isn't to collisiony, download the latest beta pcmcia package,
and it should work.
