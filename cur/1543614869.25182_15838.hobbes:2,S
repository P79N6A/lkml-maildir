So George what direction should I try for some tests?
2.4.17 plus your and Robert's preempt plus lock-break?
Add your high-res-timers, rtscheduler or both?
Do they apply against 2.4.17/2.4.18-pre1?
A combination of the above plus Davide's BMQS?
I ask because my MP3/Ogg-Vorbis hiccup during dbench isn't solved anyway.
Running 2.4.17 + preempt + lock-break + 10_vm-21 (AA).
Some wisdom?
Thank you for all your work and
			Happy New Year
-Dieter
