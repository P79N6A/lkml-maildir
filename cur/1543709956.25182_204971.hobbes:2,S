those vmas in those apps are forced to be mlocked with the rmap VM, so
it's hard for me to buy that rmap is any better. You can't even allow
those vmas to be non-mlocked or you'll finish your zone-normal even with
4:4.
on 64bit those apps will work _absolutely_best_ with objrmap and they'll
waste tons of ram (and some amount of cpu too) with rmap. objrmap is the
absolutely best model for those apps in any 64bit arch.
the argument you're making about those apps are all in favour of objrmap
IMO.

If it's the DoS that you worry about, vmtruncate will do the trick too.
overall machine remains usable for me, despite the increased cpu load.
