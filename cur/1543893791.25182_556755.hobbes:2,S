That's not exactly true. A work without explicit statements is not
licenced at all.

Of course.

Sure.

I'd be surprised if it's for GPL to decide.

How about derived works?
Am I free to get BSD source, incorporate it in GPL project, and release
the whole under GPL?
Sure, the original source stays BSD but I don't distribute it.

I'm not sure the copyright laws define "files".

I don't think the law works like that.
By default you have no rights to someone's work (file or project).
The only licence I can find with Linux is GPL v2, isn't it? And even
that wasn't stated explicite until that 2.4.0something (though there
is a consensus that the COPYING file was indeed a licence for the
whole kernel).
Then you may have additional rights, such as those given in various
source files.

What exactly is the "GPL regime" and how is it defined by copyright
law and/or the GPL licence itself (or will of copyright holders etc.)?
