getpid() could be implemented in userspace, but not via vsyscalls
(instead it could be passed in the ELF data area at process start.)
"Because we can and it's relatively easy" is a pretty good argument in
my opinion.

I think this is really an overstatement.  Timestamping etc. (and heck,
even databases) are actually perfectly usable even on smaller machines
these days.  Sure, DB vendors like to boast of their 128-way NUMA
machines, but I suspect the bulk of them run on single- and
dual-processor machines (by count, not necessarily by data volume.)
