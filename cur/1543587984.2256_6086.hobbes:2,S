Something like
View 1:	(The SGI view)
	NUMA should be implemented as a single kernel on a numa system. Andrea
has done some work on this (see his kernel.org patches), as have SGI.
View 2: (The McVoy view)
	NUMA is best viewed as another misguided attempt to do DSM and we
should run a kernel on each DSM node and do page cache borrows between nodes.
