Subject: tcp or telnet problem?

Running redhat 6.0 with redhat's kernel 2.2.5-22.
I telnet into my customer's box, they on a DSL line,
me on a dialup. I can login, and do most things just
fine. But if I do anything that produces more than
about 1/3rd of a screen of info, my output goes away.
I can no longet see anything I type, nor any output
from any operation. A second telnet's ps shows that my
commands are being executed, but all output is going
in the bit bucket.
I kinda think that this is probably in the kernel
somewere because if I take the same output that would
kill a session, and instead output it to the other pty
(ie. "netstat -t >/dev/pty/1"), it kills that pty.
Again, that pty continues to accept input, but the
output is never found again.
If i do any of that from their local network, it works
fine (a tcp latency problem?).
Any ideas, or help with things to do to diagnose this
problem would be highly appreciated as I have 5 more
of these exact installations to do.
