you'd probably be better off asking this on the kernel newbies list
rather than the main kernel list.  and, as an intro to porting 2.4 to
2.6 modules, you might want to start here:
http://lwn.net/Articles/driver-porting/
and, as others have suggested, you're probably better off just
figuring out the 2.6 kbuild structure.  trying to do this manually
without kbuild is just making this way more difficult than it has to
be.
