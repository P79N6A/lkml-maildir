Sorry, but you're wrong.
If you depend on not re-initializing the pointers, you should not use the 
"xxx_del()" function, and you should document it.
This is that the __xxx_del() functions are there for - they won't do the
poisoning. The regular delete functions have historically always poisoned
the pointers - it was only removed a few months ago by Andrew.
