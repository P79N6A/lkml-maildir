You forget that CKRM does NOT violate the constraints set forward by 
cpu_allowed masks. So most of your drawbacks described above are simply 
not true.
As such it comes back to the question whether the RCFS
and controller interfaces can be used to set the cpu_allowed masks
in accordance to the current cpuset semantics.
Absolutely we can...
I am certainly not stipulating that cpusets can replace share based 
scheduling or vice versa.
What remains to be discussed is whether
In order to allow CKRM scheduling within a cpuset here are a few 
questions to be answered:
(a) is it a guarantee/property that cpusets at with the same
     parent cpuset do not overlap ?
(b) can we enforce that a certain task class is limited to a cpuset
     and its subsets.
If we agree or disagree then we can work on a proposal for this.

See above, I think it can be. We need to answer (a) and (b) and then 
define what a share means.
