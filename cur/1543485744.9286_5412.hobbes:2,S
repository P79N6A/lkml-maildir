Well in Solaris e.g. it isn't -EBUSY either. Have a look at the trace:
rmdir(".")					Err#22 EINVAL
                                                       ^^^^^^
rmdirwrite(2, " r m d i r", 5)			= 5
: directory "write(2, " :   d i r e c t o r y  ".., 13)	= 13
.": write(2, " . " :  ", 4)				= 4
Can't remove current directory or ..write(2, " C a n ' t   r e m o v
e".., 36)	= 36
write(2, "\n", 1)				= 1
lseek(0, 0, SEEK_CUR)				= 9628
_exit(2)
So perhaps this isn't POSIX (I don't really know POSIX that much), but I
think this is the correct behaviour. You normally don't cut the tree you
are sitting on.
So IMHO you may discuss the error-code, but it really should be a error,
as this is so in (as I think) all OSs. (Even in SunOS 4.x a BSD-Unix it
returned an Error.)
But rmdir really works (under Solaris) if you do the following:
mkdir x
cd x
cmdtool &   # or any other process, but with the working directory on x
cd ..
rmdir x
So it is in fact only a problem if the process invoking the rmdir is in
the direcory which should be removed.
BTW: If you do a pwd in the new cmdtool you get a "Cannot determine
current working directory". So it really is in the removed directory.
Bye
