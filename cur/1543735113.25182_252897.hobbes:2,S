In servers, both bottlenecks are there - if you look at the cost of TCP and
filesystem processing at 10GbE, CPU is a huge problem (and will be for
foreseeable future), even for fastest 64-bit systems. 
I agree though that bus and memory are bigger issues, this is exactly the
reason for all these RDMA over Ethernet investments :-)
Anyways, did not mean to start an argument - with all the new CPU, bus and
HBA technologies coming to the market it will be another 18-24 months before
we know what works and what doesn't...
