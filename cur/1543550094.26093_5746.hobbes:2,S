Watcom C/C++ 11.0b, which is soon going to be open source.  It's not available
for Linux, however.

I'll agree with that.

Oh, I understand why #2 is necessary, that doesn't mean that I don't hear
people complain about it anyway.  On a side note, I consider lack of a real
kernel debugger to be evidence for #1.  But I don't want to kick that dead
horse again.

Very true!
