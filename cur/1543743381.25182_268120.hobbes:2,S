Hello
To Your questions:

I don't have tried it. I will do it today
> uml is triggering a host OS bug
A host OS bug? How can I get this out from the machine?
As I wrote in a later mail, at the time the harddisk spins down, the uml kernel
causes a memory error. (German: Speicherfehler) core dump.
I will try to setup a test machine which You can access to test it by Yourself, I
think i can't discribe it completely enough to give You a point for a solution.
