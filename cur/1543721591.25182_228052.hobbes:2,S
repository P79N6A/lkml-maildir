Them's the breaks.  That's the risk you take any time you open up any IP 
as open source.  This is why nVidia and ATI (lately) do not want to 
publish register references for their chips.  This exposes things which 
competitors might benefit from in some way (whether in engineering or 
marketing).
How do you do open source AND protect your IP investment at the same 
time?  That's one of the tough issues with the GPL.
