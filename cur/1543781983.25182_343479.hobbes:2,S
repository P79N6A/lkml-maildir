Subject: New maintainer needed for the Linux smb filesystem

Since Urban Widmark was not active for some time, and I didn't have any 
success trying to reach him, it seems we need a new maintainer for the 
smb filesystem in the Linux kernel.
Is there anyone who both feels qualified and wants to become the new 
maintainer?
