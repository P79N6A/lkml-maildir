I don't know if it's a result of upgrading to 2.6.8-rc2 (from 2.6.5) or 
from the patch, but it has changed things.  I still get
hdd: DMA timeout retry
hdd: timeout waiting for DMA
hdd: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hdd: status timeout: error=0x00
hdd: drive not ready for command
hdd: ATAPI reset complete
cdrom: dropping to single frame dma
but ripping stays at its normal speed (5.0x instead of 0.6x) and the 
file produced is correct instead of skipping/silence.
It doesn't fix the true issue of why I'm getting DMA timeouts, but it 
does make ripping useable.
P.S. Does anyone know why this:
gst-launch-0.8 cdparanoia ! vorbisenc ! filesink location="music.ogg"
would cause a DMA timeout but this:
gst-launch-0.8 cdparanoia ! queue ! { vorbisenc ! filesink 
location="music.ogg" }
wouldn't?
Thanks,
Dave Arnold
