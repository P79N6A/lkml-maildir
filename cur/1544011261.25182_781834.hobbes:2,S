Hi Steven,
That's a nice feature!
By reading this patch, I first thought that would be better to get rid
of set_ftrace_notrace and then use
the !func to trace all functions but the func. But this way we would
loose the feature of choosing some functions
and then remove only some of them by using the ! sign.
That's good as is.
