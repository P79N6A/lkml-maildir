A page comes from the page allocator. Access to a slab allocators "page" 
is an access to subsystem internals. Those internals vary 
(including the representation of objects in the "page") and depend on the 
slab allocator selected, the debug options in effect and parameters 
with which the slab was created etc etc.
If flush_dcache_page is applied to a slab object then we need to do a 
similar change to PA-RISC as for ARM.
