Hi,
my P2B-DS is blacklisted and the kernel forced acpi=ht. i wonder why 
because P2B-D is not blacklisted.
There is no comment or any other hint for a reason in dmi_scan.c :-(
I would like to try what happens if i remove the board from the 
blacklist. What can i test to see if it works properly? And what is the 
worse case of what could happen?
Do i have to edit dmi_scan.c for my test or is there something like 
acpi=force?
