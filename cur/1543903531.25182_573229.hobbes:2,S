First of all, that's obviously racy (list manipulations without any
exclusion *or* preventing aforementioned timer running while you do
it).
More important part is that stuff put into your private_data would
better remain valid through the lifetime of opened file.  In particular,
you _can't_ expect that process that had opened the file in question
is still alive.
