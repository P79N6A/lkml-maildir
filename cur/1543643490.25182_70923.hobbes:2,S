Subject: problem with "Use CLONE_KERNEL for the common kernel thread flags"?

Seems to me like you missed something in your latest changeset:
-#define CLONE_SIGNAL   (CLONE_SIGHAND | CLONE_THREAD)
+#define CLONE_KERNEL   (CLONE_FS | CLONE_FILES | CLONE_SIGHAND)
-       kernel_thread(init, NULL, CLONE_FS | CLONE_FILES | CLONE_SIGNAL);
+       kernel_thread(init, NULL, CLONE_KERNEL);
init used to be spawned with CLONE_THREAD and no longer is.  Was this
intentional?  The changelog entry didn't indicate it, and I haven't
been keeping track of what all the CLONE flags mean these days so I'm
not sure if this is safe.
