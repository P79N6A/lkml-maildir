I see, sneaking through try_to_unmap's anon PageSwapCache assumptions
as simply as possible - thanks.
(Coincidentally, Andrea pointed to precisely the same issue in the
no PAGE_ZERO thread, when we were toying with writable but clean.)

By re-referencing the pages.  (Hmm, so an incorrect app which accesses
"free"d areas, will undo it: well, okay, nothing terrible about that.)

mlock will undo the state in its make_pages_present: I guess that
should happen in or near follow_page's mark_page_accessed.
mremap?  Other madvises?  Nothing much at all: mremap can move
them around, and the madvises do whatever they do - I don't notice
any problem in that direction, but it'll be easier when we have an
implementation to poke at.
