Subject: 2.4.11-pre1 -- Error in ./Changes -- Wrong location given to retrieve the latest Mkinitrd
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/10/1/29

The Changes document gives the following mkinitrd information:
Mkinitrd
--------
o  <
ftp://rawhide.redhat.com/pub/rawhide/SRPMS/SRPMS/>
However, rawhide.redhat.com/pub/rawhide no longer exists.
The current directory listing for pub is:
contrib/    .private/   redhat/     .snapshot/  up2date/
I've searched the web quite a bit and have failed to find
an authoritative distribution location.
