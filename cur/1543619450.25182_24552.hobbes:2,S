BitKeeper is like a distributed, replicated file system with atomic changes.
That has certain advantages, much like a database.  What you are asking 
violates the database rules, if I understand you properly.  Are you asking
to move part of a changeset?  That's a no no, that's like moving the 
increment to your bank account without the decrement to mine; the banks
frown on that :-)
Or are you asking more about the out of order stuff, i.e., whole changesets
are fine but not all of them.
