Subject: bad ext2fs corruption in 2.2.16

I'm experiencing a problem on my laptop that is seemingly resulting in
rapid, massive ext2fs corruption on an IDE drive. The problem seems to be
correlated to use of "cdparanoia" to rip audio data from audio CDs to the
hard drive. I'm running kernel 2.2.16 on a Dell Latitude CPi A366T. 366 MHz
Pentium II, 128MB of RAM, 6GB hard drive. 
IDE controller and disk info:
PIIX4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39

This system has been in service since June of '99 without any major
disk-related problems (obviously some kernel upgrades). A few weeks ago, I
ran 'cdparanoia' and had processes start crashing randomly, so I rebooted
and fsck found lots of icky stuff. I was a little concerned, but after that
it went for weeks without any more problems (including several manual fscks
to be sure there wasn't more corruption creeping in). Today I ran
'cdparanoia' to rip some audio and almost instantly programs started
crashing again. Virtually everything I ran crashed with a seg fault. One of
the directories I was working in lost all of its entries, including "." and
"..". When the system came back up and fsck ran, there were lots and lots of
problems. Dozoens of "duplicate/bad block(s) in inode n:", "unattached
inode", "free blocks count wrong for group #n", etc. At one point there was
a message which scrolled by so quickly I couldn't read it with hundreds or
tousands of negative numbers (I'm assuming they were supposed to be block or
inode numbers), followd by "fix <y>?" I had at least 10 files in /usr/local
become corrupted. What was originally a tcl script was replaced with
apparently random binary data. What was previously a shared library was
replaced with data that begins:
sse: ") ("signature" "Unterschrift: ") ("opening" "Anrede: ") ("closing" "Schlu\
"s: ")] 15])

I don't have strong evidence that cdparanoia is causing this. It just has
been an awfully strange coincidence that both times the problem has
happened, it has been immediately after I started cdparanoia. And I have
seen absolutely no other disk-related problems.
Any ideas on what's going on here? Ideas for more troubleshooting and
diagnosis?
Thanks.
