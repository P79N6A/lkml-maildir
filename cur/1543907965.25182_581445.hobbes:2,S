There's just one bug after all.  The second was a figment of my sleep-deprived
imagination.

My bad, there's a second i2cset command that would have done it.  Please try
this patch against v2.6.22.

    hwmon: fix w83781d temp sensor type setting
    
    Commit 348753379a7704087603dad403603e825422fd9a introduced a regression that
    caused temp2 and temp3 sensor type settings to be written to temp1 instead.
    The result is that temp sensor readings could be way off.
