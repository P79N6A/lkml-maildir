Previously <linux/ptrace.h> had #include <linux/sched.h>, and mine just had
"struct task_struct;" instead for its forward references.  asm-x86_64/elf.h
uses current->field in the ELF_CORE_COPY_REGS macro, expanded in
linux/elfcore.h in elf_core_copy_regs.  So it needs sched.h but is no
longer getting it implicitly.  Since current appears in asm-x86_64/elf.h,
there is some logic to having #include <linux/sched.h> explicit there
instead of somewhere else.  But to reduce undue perturbation, I'll just
change my patch to preserve the #include in linux/ptrace.h instead.
Thanks,
Roland
