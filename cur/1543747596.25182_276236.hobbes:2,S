On the other hand, you also need to account for lost ticks for timers that 
started before interrupts were turned off, otherwise they could run for extra time.
It would be nice to have some kind of constant frequency timestamp that 
increments regardless of sleep state or interrupt status, so that sleep periods 
and such are based on timestamps rather than ticks (the period of which can vary).
