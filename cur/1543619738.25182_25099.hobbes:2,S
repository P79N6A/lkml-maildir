The compiler isnt obliged to actually generate the assignment in order
otherwise, so given
	writew(1, foo+2);
	writew(2, foo);
it might have the urge to reverse them - perhaps to optimise in using
postincrement modes
volatile says "stuff happens here beyond the compilers direct knowledge of
events".
Simple example
	i=0;
	while(i<100000) i++;
can be optimised to i=100000 if i is not volatile
