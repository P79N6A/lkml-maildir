I would really like this section to be splitted in two:
- one for Linus' lieutenants:
	your explanation, with tree to pull from is ok.
- one for occasionnal contributors:
	either plain patch on l-k
		or
	plain patch + BK changeset on l-k (using the
	Andreas Dilger script wrapper maybe, see below)

Or use bk revtool in X.
