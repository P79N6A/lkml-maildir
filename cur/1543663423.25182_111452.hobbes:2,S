Thanks.  This helps, but I was imagining something a bit
wider-ranging.  In particular I though a "Control Messages" section
would be nice, which enumerated separately all the control messages
that can be recieved, and all those that can be sent.
As far as I can tell, control message are currently defined for:
   IPv4,
   IPv6,
   SOL_HCI - some bluetooth thing
   SOL_SOCKET (which don't seem to be clearly documented in socket(7))
I might try and draft some changes to ip.7 and maybe socket.7 next
week sometime.
