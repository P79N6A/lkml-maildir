The argument that AA doesn't mediate what it is not configured to
mediate is correct, yes, but I don't think that's a valid _design_ issue
with AA.

We have a variety of filtering mechanisms which are specific to a
domain. iptables filters networking only; file permissions filter file
access only. This argument is not really strong.

If you're now arguing the "spirit of Unix", I can turn your argument
around too: the Unix spirit is to have smallish dedicated tools. If AA
is dedicated to mediating file access, isn't that nice!
AA _could_ be extended to mediate network access and IPC (and this is
WIP). If we had tcpfs and ipcfs - you know, everything is a filesystem,
the Linux spirit! ;-) - AA could mediate them as well.

However, we're discussing the way it mediates file accesses here,
for which it appears useful and capable of functionality which SELinux's
approach cannot provide.
