http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.20-rc2/2.6.20-rc2-mm1/broken-out/i386-restore-config_physical_start-option.patch
I agree. That matches the want better.
> Andrew, Can you please push this patch to 2.6.20-rc3?
No objections from me and it merely restores 2.6.19 functionality but 
also no great rush as far as I'm concerned. Can live with applying it 
manually for a release. See Xen was the original restoration reason; 
maybe they really want it in 2.6.20...
Thanks,
Rene
