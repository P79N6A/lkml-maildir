This is what "poll" is for: it would not be overly hard to add a new
POLL_XXX type that says "the underlying data has changed", and make
directories and regular files honour that.
I would refuse to add some new mechanism when poll() fits the bill so well
(you can't use select() or any of the existing poll flags, because they
have specified behaviour).
