Subject: [-rt] Fix race condition and following BUG in PI-futex

I ran into the bug on 2.6.17-rt8 with the previous posted patches which 
make pthread_timed_lock() work on UP, but the bug is there without the 
patches - I just can't trigger it - and it is also in the mainline kernel.
The problem is that rt_mutex_next_owner() is used unprotected in 
wake_futex_pi(). At least it isn't probably serialiazed against the next 
owner being signalled or getting a timeout. The only lock, which is 
good enough here, is &pi_state->pi_mutex.wait_lock, so I added this 
protection.
