That's plain normal, IOW nothing to worry about.
ACPI idling causes huge changes in CPU power consumption which then
may result in some capacitors or coils "chatting" a bit too much ;)
Choosing CONFIG_HZ=1000 instead of CONFIG_HZ=100 (or the other way around?)
should help, as may the new dynticks option once it's become available
in mainline Linux kernel.
But I wouldn't decide changing those settings based on the capacitor chirping
only, it's much more useful to adjust those depending on your performance
criteria.
...unless the chirping is so high-pitched, loud and annoying that adapting
these things specifically for noise reduction is very desireable.
Oh, and I certainly don't recommend acpi=off for this: that's throwing
out the baby with the bathwater ;)
