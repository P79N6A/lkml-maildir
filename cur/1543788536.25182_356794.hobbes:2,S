OK, I think I see the problem better now.

You _could_ take the namespace semaphore across lookup_hash() and
follow_mount(), but I'm not sure everybody would like that.
Are you planning to post a patch?  Atomic open+create is something
that FUSE wants as well, so it would be nice to get a proper solution
into the kernel.
I'll think a bit more about solving the mount thing properly.
