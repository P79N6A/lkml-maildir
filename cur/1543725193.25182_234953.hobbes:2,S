Yes, I've seen this multiple times.
I also agree that it seems a sensible patch. I have one dumb question.
Given that we're panicing and we know things are "bad", is there any
reason not to call smp_send_stop() as early as possible, rather than as
the last thing which we currently do? As you say, the other cpus are
happily continuing, potentially destroying data, and it seems that
stopping this as quickly as possible would be desirable.
