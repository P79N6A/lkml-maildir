Just made a try with RT-V0.6.2 and it locks pretty easily on my P4/UP
laptop while running my jackd-R + 9*fluidsynth workload. These tests are
setup to run for 5 min. Not once it got through, and I've tried several
times now.
Although it's been 100% reproducible, the system lockup varies in tine
from the start of the test. Unfortunately it says nothing through
netconsole, so there's no additional info/dump/trace to give you for
analysis.
Most of the kernel hacking/debugging options are unset (N), except
Magic-SysRq. Hitting on SysRq+T, right after when system hangs, comes out
with absolutely nothing, only this line (via netconsole):
SysRq : Show State
Guess something's got wrong, yet again.
