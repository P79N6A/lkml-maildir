I thought I'd test it right now while the system is runnng normally, 
but I got only a beep from the console, so I went to 
Documentation/sysrq.txt to make sure I was doing it right, and it is 
_not_ working right now.  But it is compiled in according to a make 
xconfig, or a grep of the .config.
[root@coyote linux-2.6.10-rc1-bk13]# grep SYSRQ .config
CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ=y
I get a couple of beeps from the console, but thats the limit of the 
response, and a tail -f on the log shows nothing.  I also logged into  
VC2, and tried it there, but that attempt didn't even get me a beep, 
several times.
The keyboard is a cheap ($24) M$ with a few extra buttons that don't 
do anything along the top.  And getting a bit creaky in its old age, 
a lot like me, but I'm about 68 years older than the keyboard :)
