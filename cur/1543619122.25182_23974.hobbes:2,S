I understand that the sort of careful hierarchy that drives this
process is, by nature, an informal thing.  But it would still be nice
if _suggestions_ on how it worked were written down somewhere.  When
you've got patches that don't have a clear relevant maintainer, it
would be nice to have something more specific than "post to
linux-kernel and pray someone picks it up" to run with!
