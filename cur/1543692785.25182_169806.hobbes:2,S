The address itself is not important.
What's important is that if a prefetch erratum fault happens while
mmap_sem or any spinlock are held, then do_page_fault must not try to
acquire mmap_sem.  That can deadlock or schedule; both are bad.
Checking the address is an easy way to ensure that: addr >= TASK_SIZE
implies that no vma lookup is needed, hence mmap_sem is not needed.
There is already an addr >= TASK_SIZE test, so this can be hooked in
without any penalty, in fact it will streamline the existing code a bit.
