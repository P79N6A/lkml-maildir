Since you are using a built-in serial port, Dick Johnson's suggested 
method is, by far, the best return on your effort. The entry points 
in serial.c, rs_ioctl or set_modem_info, are "static" and would also 
require you to synthesize a tty "info" structure. Anything more 
than the quick hack would best be done by looking up the driver's 
port structure and calling rs_ioctl through the standard interface. 
That would be much more effort to get right. 
See function "set_modem_info" in drivers/char/serial.c for an example 
of setting the MCR. You should write and use a shell script that opens 
the port, turns off CREAD (to avoid echo writes), turns off HUPCL (to 
avoid disconnect related MCR writes), and holds the port open but 
leaves it idle. 
For example, something like:
	(stty -cread -hupcl; sleep 99999d) < /dev/ttyS0 &
That will get the UART initialized and held in an 
operational state while you program the MCR register from inside 
the kernel to change the modem signal states. If you are sure that 
there will be _NO_ other use of the port, then it will not be 
necessary to turn off interrupts while changing the MCR. (That's what 
the "save_flags(flags); cli();" and "restore_flags(flags);" lines of 
code do.)
Keep in mind that this is a brute force solution ...
Good luck.
