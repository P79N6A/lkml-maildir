This is a bug. The MMC_RSP_R? #defines do not fully characterise the
responses (specically, the way that the response is parsed is not
characterised) and consequently there is no guarantee of uniqueness.
Given this reality - the way that the tifm_sd driver works is unsafe.
If R6 had not been incorrectly defined (the missing RSP_OPCODE should
always have been there), then this code would not have worked. As things
currently stand, it is necessary to also check the command number to
decide on the correct response type - that's suboptimal and it's probably
good to uniquely identify the response in the mmc_command in some other
fashion.
I'm going to remove the R6 fix from my next diff to keep these things
distinct but this needs to be resolved.
