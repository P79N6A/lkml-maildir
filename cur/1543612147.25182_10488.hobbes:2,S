I recently bought a fujifilm finepix 1300. Cool stuff and works with
minimal effort with USB.
However, after a few days, I was not able tomount the usb mass storage
of the cam anymore. It reposted at mount :
mount: /dev/sdb1 is not a valid block device
checked the process table and saw several usb processes in Z state. I
killed their paret and that went away. still usb-storage was loaded.
Tried to remove it -- oops process in D state. Note that khubd also was
in a Z state. All was not recoverable so a restart was needed.
