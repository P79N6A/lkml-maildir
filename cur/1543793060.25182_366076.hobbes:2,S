Thanks for the info.  Don't worry about the taboo.  But yes, it is
conceivable that the nVidia driver interferes in some way here,
and we simply don't know how advise on that.

Good, yes, do follow their advice.  But I hope they'll be doing
something to solve whatever their problems are with PREEMPT.

Okay, even better, please do tempt fate if you're willing, and let me
know if you get any "Bad rmap" or "Bad page state" messages (the more
the better from my point of view).  Though of course the nVidia means
it's not very likely that I'll be able to deduce much from the info.
Thanks,
Hugh
