You missed my point.
The attack would have gained root. He could 'exec rm -rf /'
or fdisk, or 'cat /dev/random > /dev/sda', or _anything_ else.
Disabling modules interface won't stop bad people doing bad things.
It will just stop good people doing anything productive.
Time would be better spent improving security elsewhere.
Instead of thinking of ways to stop people doing things when they get in,
stop them getting in in the first place..
