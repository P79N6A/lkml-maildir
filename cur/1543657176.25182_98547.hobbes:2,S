That might have been appropriate for PCI-mostly APIs, since those tend to
be resource-rich.  Maybe.  (It always seemed like an API bug to me.)
I can't buy that logic in the "generic" case though.  Heck, haven't all
the address space allocation calls in Linux always exposed ENOMEM type
faults ... except PCI?  This one is _really_ easy to fix now.  Resources
are never infinite.

For me, designing any "generic" API to handle common cases (like allocation
failures) reasonably (no BUGging!) is a fundamental design requirement.
Robust drivers are aware of things like allocation faults, and handle them.
If they do so poorly, that can be fixed like any other driver bug.

Absolutely *any* system can have situations where the relevant address space
(or memory) was all in use, or wasn't available to a non-blocking request
without blocking, etc.  Happens more often on some systems than others; I
just chose SA-1111 since your approach would seem to make that unusable.
If that isn't a "good case", why not?  And what could ever be a "good case"?

IMO that's the worst of all possible worlds.  The error paths would get
even less testing than they do today.  If there's a fault path defined,
use it in all cases:  don't just BUG() in some modes, and some drivers.
