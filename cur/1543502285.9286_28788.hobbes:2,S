Yes, this was also my observation.

Did it, retested on a 4 processor machine, ran all sorts of memory hogs that
easyly knocked out the machine before, so I can say that your patches are a
step forward and at least the really critical fixes should go into 2.2.11.
But after some additional testing, I've able to kill the userspace again.
The kernel was still running, but the SYSRQ-S Emergency sync did'nt work
again, also not after much SYSRQ-I. SYSRQ-T still showed my hogs and
SYSRQ-P showed stext_lock most of the time. The second function i saw
was in stext_lock.
Here the exact EIP's:
80111128 (often)
80111136 (once)
801111ae (once)
801fa904 (neary every EIP)
801fa90b (often)
Here my System.map:
801110fc T do_check_pgt_cache
801111bc T __bad_pagetable
801fa330 T stext_lock
801fe884 r error_table
Maybe I can look into this...
