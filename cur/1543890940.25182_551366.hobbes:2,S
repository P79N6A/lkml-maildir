Thanks Arnaldo.  I noticed this earlier, but mistakenly didn't consider it
an issue aside of code needing to be cleaned up and for hotplug (which I
thought was already broken for other reasons).  And the Opteron I tested
on has possible == online.  I tested this addition on both the AMD box,
as well as an Intel box with possible > online.  All looks good.
