To me, this looks like a drive that has just been
powered down by the BIOS power management stuff.
Often when that happens, the BIOS also powers down
part of the chipset, leaving us just zeros in the
register space -- makes it impossible to recover
unless the driver "knows" about power management for
that specific chipset.
Just a (good) guess.
