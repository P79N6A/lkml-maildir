I have tried RH 2.4.18 stock redhat kernels and and 2.4.20 kernels. Both 
seem to
do badly.
Is there somewhere to look to see a history of the schedular work, or do 
I need
to puruse all of the changelogs to get an idea of what kernel I should 
be trying.
                                            Regards
                                            Mike
