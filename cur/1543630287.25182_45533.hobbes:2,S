Ok, I signed up to this list from work under the name aeleblanc, now i'm at
home, so to see this history look at the other messages, anyway, i was
having alot of troubles getting DMA Working on my system, its a duron 1GHz
on an ECS Motherboard w/ an SiS Chipset. Actually, even with DMA Disabled i
was getting Hard drive errors... anyway, I tried compiling 2.5.15 because i
was told that 2.4.19-pre8 and up had better IDE Support, but during the boot
process on the new Kernel I get the following messages
hda: dma_intr: error=0x84 {DriveStatusError BadCRC }
hda: recalibrating!
{ dma_intr }
hda: dma_intr: error=0x84 {DriveStatusError BadCRC }
{ dma_intr }
hdb: DMA Disabled
then the system Locks solid.
can anyone help me with this, this is the third kernel I've tried and
they've all had very serisous problems.
