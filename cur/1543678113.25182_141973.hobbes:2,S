There is no cryptoloop installation which is affected by this. Read my mail
properly. Every cryptoloop setup out there uses loop-AES or kerneli's
patch-int. And both fixed this issue a _long_ time ago. (Have a look at
the linux-crypto archives of 2001).
Adam Richter's version of loop.c which is in his ygg tree is quite nice,
but his changes are HUGE. Nobody is going to split them up in small patches.
Again: _no_ userbase is affected by this change. Every userbase which
could have ever been affected has done the fix for itself.
