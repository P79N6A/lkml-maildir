The whole idea of reinterpreting file operations to mean something utterly
different just seems inappropriate to me.
You get a lot of goodies when using a filesystem - the ability for
unrelated processes to look things up, resource release on exit(), etc.  If
those features are valuable in the ocfs2 context then fine.  But I'd have
thought that it would be saner and more extensible to add new syscalls
(perhaps taking fd's) rather than overloading the open() mode in this
manner.
