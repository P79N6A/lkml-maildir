I'm pretty sure it's a reasonably safe assumption gcc doesn't reorder members
of structs as long as they are naturally aligned - otherwise I assume structs
used for DMA would need to be fixed, too ?

For PCI, what ioremap() returns is a pointer type (it is not necessarily a
valid pointer, of course), so all mapped I/O addresses are representable by
a structure pointer (unless we had a really broken ABI where certain void *
couldn't be cast to struct pointers).
I'm not sure how the physical address space matters for this.
