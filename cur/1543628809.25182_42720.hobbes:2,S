I just pushed the best part of another 1MB worth of bits
to Jeff & Linus, in the vain hope of getting my tree under 5MB
away from mainline by the end of the month (yeah right).
Anyway. here's a list of some of the bigger pieces that are left
in my tree, along with the grand merging masterplan..
Hopefully by the end of the weekend, quite a few more from the
pending list will also be gone Linuswards.
	Dave.
