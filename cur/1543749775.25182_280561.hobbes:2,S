The confusion comes from "low nice priority". The lower the nice value 
the higher the priority.
Anyway, you still haven't give enough data to analyze. What does your 
application do? Is it I/O intensive? If it is, it could be that the 
kernel itself is hogging the CPU doing I/O on behalf of a low prio 
process (priority, specially in 2.4, only affects CPU distribution and 
not I/O). How do you know it's not being preempted? What is your 
.config? What patches do you have applied? And finally, why don't you 
upgrade to a 2.6 kernel :) ?
