They're aliases.  On the x86 my e1000 Ethernet driver loads using this
alias name:
"pci:v00008086d00001010sv*sd*bc*sc*i*"
In fact, the e1000 driver has 63 alias names in addition to "e1000"
But it's still the e1000 driver after it is loaded.
jonsmirl@terra:/home/linux/drivers/net/e1000$ lsmod | grep e1000
e1000                 115968  0
Loading a I2C driver with an OF alias name is not going to change the
module name after it is loaded. In fact, once the module is in memory
there's no way to tell what name was used to load it.
OF device names are set by the Open Firmware committee. It is not
reasonable to force the Linux names back into Open Firmware since this
would force the other operating systems using Open Firmware to adopt
the Linux names.
This issue hasn't been visible before since there was a global table
in the PowerPC code mapping all known Open Firmware names into linux
names. Keeping this as a global table doesn't scale. The mapping needs
to be done by each device individually.
