I've got basicly the same problem (only worse). 2.6.7(,mm5) get 
~10 bytes/sec from seattletimes.com and 25 Kbytes/sec when I "echo 
0 > tcp_default_win_scale; \ echo 0 > tcp_moderate_rcvbuf;". This may be
open-source where you ask users to test, but asking users to setup
non-trivial HARDWARE and NETWORKS seems to be asking a bit much. YMMV, 
etc.
I'll get intrested if it doesn't fix its self by rc time.
Thomas (who could test on a "private network", but is a lazy bastard.)
