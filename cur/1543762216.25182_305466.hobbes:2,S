It has to do with Hugh Dickin's patches which haven't been
integrated yet.
It may be the case that Alpha needs to override the pgd_addr_end(),
pmd_addr_end(), etc. macros (just like sparc64 and ia64), especially
if there are holes in the Alpha address space.  But my recollection
is that there are not any.
Linus's tree is working just fine for me, it's just the new stuff
Hugh Dickins and Nick Piggin are working on.
