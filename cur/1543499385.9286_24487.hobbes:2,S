The bridge ought to be doing posted writes which should gather the writebacks.
Do you have posted write enabled

Read will be worse across PCI, you need the card to do writes to the host
memory. You want to push data around PCI not pull it off things.

You may want to read the intel CPU docs about the memory type range
registers and also look at the linux mtrr driver
