  I was assuming all archs used a macro for this, so I used:
$ grep 'define atomic_inc_return' asm-*/atomic.h
  But your grep could have found this:
        /* FIXME: this arch does not have atomic_inc_return */
and returned a false positive.
  What I need is a C-aware grep:
$ cgrep [--definition | --comment | --usage] atomic_inc_return asm-*/atomic.h
to search definitions, comments, and code body respectively.
