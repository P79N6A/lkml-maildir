This message is not a bogas message with ls-120 drives in 2.4.9. No problem 
occurs in 2.4.8. And, no problem occurs in 2.4.9 if the ide-floppy.c and 
ide.c from 2.4.8 replace the ones in 2.4.9. But, if the 2.4.9 kernel is built 
as is, then message appears on boot up and on attempting to mount a ls-120 
diskette even if a disketee is in the drive!
