i _do_ have a quilt tree, but i never had the clean splitup above. Why? 
Because i worked on all of these aspects (and a whole lot of other 
aspects as well) in parallel during the past 2 days, back and forth, 
often mixing changes, etc. and there was never any clean splitup.
Now it turned out that the clean splitup of -rc0->final delta would ease 
Gene's testing so i created it. Note that this is just 30% of the total 
v1->v2 delta and i just saved the work of having to do a clean splitup 
of the other 70%. (and note that this splitup will be undone because it 
makes no sense for any potential upstream merge at all, it's only to 
ease testing for Gene)
