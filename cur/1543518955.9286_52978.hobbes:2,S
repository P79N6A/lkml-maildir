Hello SCSI people,
I have been using a hacked sd.c to allow me to write to a floptical
drive. Now I have a real SCSI READ/WRITE CDROM (Yamaha CRW6416SZ).
Has anybody written a driver and made a tool to format it? The
Adaptec BIOS won't let me format it because "Not a DISK". So I
need to send a "format-unit" command, plus make a driver that
makes it it look like a disk block-device. No problem, but I don't
want to do what somebody has already done.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
