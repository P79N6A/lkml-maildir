Subject: [PATCH 0/3] Demand faulting for hugetlb
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I am sending out the latest set of patches for hugetlb demand faulting.
I've incorporated all the feedback I've received from previous
discussions and I think this is ready for some more widespread testing.
Is anyone opposed to spinning this in -mm as it stands?
The three patches:
 1) Remove a get_user_pages() optimization that is no longer valid for
demand faulting
 2) Move fault logic from hugetlb_prefault() to hugetlb_pte_fault()
 3) Apply a simple overcommit check so demand fault accounting behaves
in a manner in line with how prefault worked
Diffed against 2.6.13-git6
