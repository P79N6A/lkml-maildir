theres nothing that software can do with a pci bus lockup. You need a 
hardware watchdog to reboot the system for this type of failure.
PCI has a very tight spec, and running a card (say on an extender) or with 
another card that has too many loads can cause a bus failure. If you have 
more than 4 cards on the bus you are out of spec, for example.
But that doesnt change the panic issue. if you have hardware problems you 
cant expect any OS to help you, you need new  hardware.
