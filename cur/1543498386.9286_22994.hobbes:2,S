So you create one symbolic link for each CD-ROM interface type. So far
I count 3: IDE, SCSI and possibly USB. PCMCIA is just IDE.
What's the problem?

The clutter benefit of devfs comes in part because you only have
devices for what you need. The other part is that there is a sensible
heirarchy rather than lumping everything in /dev.
The symlinks would be put under /dev/cd. And it's only ever going to
have a few entries because I can't imagine many different interface
types being implemented.
Now, if you *really* care, you can have devfsd create the symlinks in
/dev/cd as each interface type is loaded. Personally, I wouldn't
bother.
