Actually, the test above with the processor module removed proved
that it isn't ACPI C-states -- as they will not be available.
You should be able to observe that /proc/acpi/processor/*/power
does not indicate any C-state use when processor is unloaded.
My guess was that some deep C-state with long exit latency
was interfering with the device.  booting w/o the processor
module should have left you running the native mwait idle.
booting with idle=halt should have left you running the HLT idle.
booting with idle=poll is a busy spin loop that never enters
any hardware power saving state.
I'm quite puzzled that idle=halt was not sufficient to solve the issue,
because that should be the lowest exit latency idle loop.
So maybe I'm wrong about the cause -- though I can't then
explain why idle=poll helps...
All of the idle selection options cause the kernel to print
a line with the word "idle" in it.  Perhaps you could search
your dmesg for "idle" to verify that it is running what we
think it is?
