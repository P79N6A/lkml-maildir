Currently, xpmem blocks faults for the range specified at the _begin
callout, then shoots down remote TLBs and does the put_page for all the
pages in the specified range.  The _end callout merely removes the block.
We do not do any wait for I/O.  By the time we return from the _begin
callout, all activity by the remotes is stopped, pages are dereferenced,
and future faults are blocked until released by the _end callout.
Thanks,
