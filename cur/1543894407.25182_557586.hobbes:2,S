This is true of most licences. Ask musicians about trying to get their
music back from a record company.

For those marked parts yes - thats the authors choice. Some of the kernel
is dual licensed BSD even so you can use that bit for all sorts of stuff.
Again authors choice, some authors wanted to share code between Linux and
other projects. I believe you can buy proprietary licenses to reiserfs
too.
Some authors like GPLv2 or later, some don't trust the FSF, some will
decide once GPLv3 is out, some couldn't care etc.. as the kernel doesn't
do copyright assignment all these wishes are respected and that is how it
should be.
