This is just a fix to keep chandev working as long as it's there and
drivers depend on it. We're working on getting rid of chandev altogether,
as we don't need any more it once driverfs and hotplug are working well 
for s390 ccw devices.
The new code is not stable yet and so far works only for qeth and dasd,
so there is not much point in breaking everything else atm.
