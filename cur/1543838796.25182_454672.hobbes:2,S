If you watch some allocation size traces then it's not clear power of two

For networking it might be useful. For it the allocator is quite performance
critical and the common case for large objects is 1.5k+sizeof(skb_shared_info)
MTU sized packets. This would need a new
At some point I had a hack to hint to the slab allocator about MTU
sizes of network interfaces, but I dropped it because it didn't seem 
useful without anything else to store in a page (2K objects vs 1.5k
objects still only fit two per page)
But if you have metadata you could use it. Drawback even more
complexity because you have another special case?
