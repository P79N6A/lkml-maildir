Hi Ingo:
I noticed that local_bh_disable is now always out-of-line.  The
change was made when TRACE_IRQFLAGS was added.  However, with
TRACE_IRQFLAGS off, local_bh_disable does exactly the same work
as before.  In particular, it does pretty much the same as what
preempt_disable does and the latter is always inline.
So I'm wondering if it would be reasonable to make it out-of-line
when TRACE_IRQFLAGS is off.  This may make a difference because
the networking stack is a frequent user of local_bh_disable and
local_bh_enable.
Thanks,
