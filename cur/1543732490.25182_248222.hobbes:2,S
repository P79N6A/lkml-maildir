Or TOPS-20, a precursor to VMS in some ways.  It was a nice feature.

It was usually an automatic cleanup past a certain point or if you
went over disk quota.  
In any case, while I do like this feature, I'm not sure how we would
cleanly implement this inside the unix namespace, or if inside a new
namespace, how that new namespace would be joined with a standard Unix
one.
