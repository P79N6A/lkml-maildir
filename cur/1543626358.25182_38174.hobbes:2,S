Hi,
I have an i840 motherboard with dual 733 MHz PIIIs and a Matrox G400 
MAX, and I am also seeing console corruption with 2.4.18. The difference 
with me is that I *only* see it when I am using xine (CVS) and the 
SyncFB video plugin, possibly the Xv video plugin sometimes too. When I 
kill xine, the regular multicoloured rectangle disappears from the console.
Obviously, this isn't something that I would normally notice - I 
wouldn't have noticed at all if the CVS xine hadn't locked up on me in 
full-screen mode, forcing me to turn to a console to kill it.
A few other things:
- since I have about 1.25 GB of RAM, I have enabled a 256 MB AGP aperture.
- I am using XFree86 4.2, but with the mga.o module that is native to 
Linux 2.4.18. I have not installed the Matrox HAL X module.
Whatever is causing this console corruption, it doesn't seem to be a VIA 
bug (in my case, anyway).
Chris
