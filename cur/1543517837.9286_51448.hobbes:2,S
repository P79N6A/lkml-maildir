	I think it should be placed in a a phisically
	unwritable memory (ROM), or you can kill the daemon
	and simply start another one.
	I once had a diskless machine running from a 
	customized rh4.0 cd image that was compromised, and found the
	running named very different from the one on the cd...
	If you sign binaries and make the kernel validate
	them at every run, you bind them to the kernel.
	This way you can't change one component without
	changing all of them. This raises the security barrier,
	if the kernel knows the public key only and
	the private one is (say) on a separate, offline developement
	machine.
