Hi,
The lockup is probably caused by a patch that made it in the tree 
which adds an interrupt disable/enable to keep interrupt assertion 
state synced between 82547 and APIC. This patch was in the tree before 
but was reverted a while back because it locked up 82547 CSA-based LOMs. 
Apparently it made it back in. Below I have inserted a patch (against 2.6.3)
which 
removes it again. Feel free to test if it stops the lockups.
Regards,
Alex Scheele
