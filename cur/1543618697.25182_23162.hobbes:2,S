I am writing a module and would like to perform arithmetic on long 
long variables. When I try to do this the module does not load due
to the unresolved symbols __udivdi3 and __umoddi3. I notice these
are normally defined in libc. Is there any way I can do this in a 
kernel module.
Many Thanks
Simon.
