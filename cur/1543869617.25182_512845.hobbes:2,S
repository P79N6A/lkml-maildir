Well, fwiw, I rebooted to 2.6.20 after looking at the error message again, 
and I didn't expect it to work, and it didn't.  Attempting to build it 
from a console before I ever startx'd, the error message is that the 
modules are versioned as "" where the kernel is "2.6.20".
========================================
[Message] Kernel Module : Trying to install a precompiled kernel module.
[Message] Kernel Module : Precompiled kernel module version mismatched.
[Message] Kernel Module : Found kernel module build environment, 
generating kernel module now.
ATI module generator V 2.0
==========================
initializing...
Error:
kernel includes at /lib/modules/2.6.20/build/include do not match current 
kernel.
they are versioned as ""
instead of "2.6.20".
you might need to adjust your symlinks:
- /usr/include
- /usr/src/linux
[Error] Kernel Module : Failed to compile kernel module - please consult 
readme.
=======================
Modules versioning is enabled in the build .config:
[root@coyote linux-2.6.20]# grep VERSION .config
CONFIG_LOCALVERSION=""
# CONFIG_LOCALVERSION_AUTO is not set
# CONFIG_MODVERSIONS is not set
CONFIG_MODULE_SRCVERSION_ALL=y
So it appears the installer simply isn't capable of finding the modinfo at 
all.
So much for ati's linux support, they can't even throw working code over 
the fence.  I've ordered an nvidia 6800 card for the next round of 
testing.  2+ years of screwing around with a garden slug speed video is 
enough.
Thanks for the reply Con, I appreciate it.
