This machine has a dual core processor, and the governors control each core independently. Unfortunately it's the power fluctuations of the entire socket that causes noise, not just each processor.

I'm not 100% sure of this as the damn noise comes and goes, but I've been running for an hour or so now with one core disabled and without my anti-noise patch.

Actually, there are more uncertaininties. Suspecting some machines
seemed to produce noise whenever they were in low-power state. Not
with fluctuations: when I forced them to low-power, it just produced
steady beep.
