You get 2d, semi-accelerated (that is, XAA only) graphics, at whatever
resolution you want, with X's "nv" driver.
Installing the NVidia kernel stuff + other libraries gets you better
acceleration on X, Render, Xv, and of course hardware-accelerated GLX.
It's actually not a bad card, lots of speed and decent quality... but
the module is occasionally flaky, and, of course, undebuggable. :)
