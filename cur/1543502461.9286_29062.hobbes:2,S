Since nobody was offended, I continue :-)

Sorry.
I am talking about fast file type determination in userspace.
Scanning file headers each time is slow.
The only possible solution I see is cache:
     type = get_file_type_from_cache( key );
Here the key (index) may be only full path name,
since UNIX does not use file extensions
and inodes are not invariant for files.
Moreover, such cache must be stored in external (for FS)
database (unlike symlinks in ext2).
I.e. it will:
1. duplicate names of all files on the computer,
2. pull drive heads.
I.e. it will be large and slow.

While you created these files, they were defragmented and cached.
In real situation you'll get some seconds.

Let me call to (my) 'file types' problem - "first problem".
Then ACLs will be second. And so along.

Pay attention: "... simpler *kernel* mechanism".
As I said:
1. Security can not be implemented in userspace.
2. mv have to be rewritten if you implement ACLs in ANY concept.

For example updating recent directories list.
