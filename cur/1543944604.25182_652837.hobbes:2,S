I like using "guilt" because I can easily reapply the patchset using
"guilt push -a", which is just slightly fewer characters to type than
"git-quiltimport".  This also means that I don't need to switch back
and forth between "git mode" and "quilt mode" when I'm editing the
patches (either directly by editing the patch files, in which case
afterwards I do a "guilt pop -a; guilt push -a", or by using "guilt
pop", "guilt push", and "guilt refresh").
"guilt push -a" is a little bit slower than "quilt push -a", but not
enough to be seriously annoying.  And besides, "guilt pop -a" is
slightly faster than "quilt pop -a".
Using guilt is also nice because there is a bit of additional backup
for previous work via the git reflogs, although to be honest I've
rarely needed to use it.
