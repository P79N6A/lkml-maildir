Sorry, I misread the question as being a mismatch between the 
capabilities of the device binding and the driver, not about the 
specific compatible name.  Something like "generic-ide" would probably 
be better.

The gap between registers is nonstandard, but that's a fairly common 
type of noncompliance in embedded-land, and probably merits being 
supported in a generic way.  I wouldn't call it "highly" nonstandard.
Is there some other non-standardness that I'm missing?

What would be the advantage of maintaining a list of chips whose only 
difference is register spacing, rather than just using reg-shift and 
being done with it?
