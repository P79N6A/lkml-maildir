It makes sense if
- the dbox2 core code gets merged into mainline, which is our goal, but
  can take a huge amount of time.
- someone rips off the frontend module of a dbox2 and puts it on his
  PCI DVB card because this Atmel chip rocks so much :-)
  It will require only very few changes to the PCI driver...
- or a company decides to use this chip on their brand new DVB-C device
  and john doe decides to write a Linux driver for it. He will then
  notice that there is already a driver for the frontend module and can
  therefore save a lot of work.

no.
