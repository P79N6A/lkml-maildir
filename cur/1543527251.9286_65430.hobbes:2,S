It looks like hardware, I'm afraid.  Seeing single-bit errors in page
tables is one of the surest signs that you're getting odd memory
corruptions.  It can be main memory or CPU-related: reseating your
memory and disabling the CPU cache in the BIOS are the first two things
to try to help narrow down the problem.
