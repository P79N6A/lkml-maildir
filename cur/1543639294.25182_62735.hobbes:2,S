I'm curious what part of C99 guarantees that it must generate
	add 1 to memory
not
	load memory
	add 1
	store memory
It certainly guarantees not to cache it for use next statement, but does
it actually persuade the compiler to use direct operations on memory ?
I'm not a C99 language lawyer but genuinely curious
