Pardon Herbert, I didn't say anything about getting rid yet :-) I've 
just reread what I wrote and didn't find a drop of that :-) But if I was 
fuzzy, I'm sorry.
I meant there are 2 situations:
1. input data is compressible;
2. input data isn't compressible.
JFFS2 wants the following from pcompress():
1. compressible data: compress it; the offered formerly algorithm works 
just fine here.
2. non-compressible data: do not compress it, leave it uncompressed; the 
offered algorithm works fine here too - it returns an error.
So, the essence of the question was: the offered algorithm is OK for 
JFFS2 (but need some refining). May we preserve it and don't bother 
about predicting how much buffer space we need to reserve in case the 
input data is non-compressible?
