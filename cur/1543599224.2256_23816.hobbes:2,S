There is still another reason..

The problem they are describing is not the change in power dissipation,
but the change in current draw from the regulated 1.75V (difference of
about 30A or more). During this almost instantaneous transition either
your mobo regulator or your PSU can give up for a while and you get a nice
crash. This tends to happen more often with the 1400-Cs.
