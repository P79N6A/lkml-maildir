Hi,
I run RH 7.1 and on installation Kudzu detected a IBM ISA ETHERJET as my
NIC card. But couldnt locate module for it. I found cs89x0 as a match but
on loading reported that the io or the irq was wrong and no device was
found on that adrs.
Now how do I rectify this and install this module. Its our intranet Server
and has to networked ASAP. Reply me ASAP..
