You cannot use this compiler for any program that uses an interface that
needs long long.
BTW: C99 requires long long but the Large File summit from 1995 did to the
same since 1995. An 32 bit OS that supports large files cannot have a compiler
that does not support long long.
If TenDRA C does support 64 bit integral type in a different way. TenDRA C
would need to deliver include files that take care about this fact.
