One comment: probably the best way to maintain backwards compatibility
for people who used binfmt_misc as a module would be the following:
post-install binfmt_misc /bin/mount -t binfmt_misc none /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc
pre-remove binfmt_misc /bin/umount /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc
in the /etc/modules.conf. Then insmod binfmt_misc and rmmod binfmt_misc
will have the same effect as they used to do.
However, the Right Thing(tm) is
	a) let mount do insmod (not the other way round)
	b) use less idiotic mountpoint (binfmt_misc is sysctl-related, so it
got no business being under /proc/sys).
BTW, the new code in fs/binfmt_misc.c can be considered as a demo on how to turn
drivers into filesystems...
