Longer term, I don't want them to be entirely different beasts. Once I
get swapfile support working for 2.4, I have no plans for further
development. I plan that my next task will be to port it to 2.5/6, and
then begin to seek to merge it with Pavel, Andrew or whoever will take
patces as far as they are willing.
Regards,
Nigel
