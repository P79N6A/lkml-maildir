Well, I won't say that I find them 100% rock solid, but you seem to be
able to reproduce a lot of serious issues. Have you filed bug reports
to get them fixed ? You cannot expect people to fix bugs they're not
aware of !
Also it would be a good idea to get all those issues fixed soon, because
2.6.27-stable will be maintained for a long time.
