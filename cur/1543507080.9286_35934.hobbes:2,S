No, what I meant by saying (perhaps in a joking manner which made it
vague) "select(2) always says YES! to all questions" is that, quoting
Single UNIX spec:
   File descriptors associated with regular files always select true for
   ready to read, ready to write, and error conditions. 
This is why I called it "disappointing", i.e. select(2) does not do what
one might naively expect - tell me when the (regular) file has changed,
instead it always says "READY!" on all fdsets.
And rightly so - because Single UNIX v2 specs says so and specs are always
right :)

Ah, ok. Implement an ioctl cmd within your device driver that allows user
process to "register" itself (or another pid) as a "receiver of event
notification" ala fcntl(F_SETOWN) thing and when the event occurs make the
driver send SIGsomething (e.g. SIGUSR1) to the process, which presumably
called sigaction(2) to register a signal handler for SIGUSR1.
This is just the first thing that comes to a tired mind about to leave for
home... there must be something better but I must dash off or I'll miss my
bus :)
