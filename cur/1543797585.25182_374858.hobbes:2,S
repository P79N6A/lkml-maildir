I'd rather see the statement that if a kernel 2.6.N requires a userspace
update (udev, alsa, whatever), that the new userspace works correctly on
2.6.(N-10).
I think that is the bit of the problem that has been really frustrating
to the people that have run into it.
(I think that is the complaint Dave Jones made during his OLS keynote,
and I've seen a similar complaint about udev, though the udev issue
may have been Debian specific.)
