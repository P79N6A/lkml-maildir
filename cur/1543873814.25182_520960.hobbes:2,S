COMPAT_VDSO causes the link address to be fixed at compile time to match 
the virtual address of the VDSO.  !COMPAT_VDSO just links at zero.

There wasn't relocation logic before, the VDSO just got remapped to a 
different virtual address without any relocation at all.  Which is safe, 
because it is all hand-coded assembly, relocatable code.  But not 
complete, since the ELF headers don't have any fixup applied for the 
relocation, and there are broken linkers which look at the ELF headers 
and assert fail if ph->p_vaddr != _rtld_local._dl_sysinfo_dso; these 
broken dynamic linkers are what COMPAT_VDSO is protecting.

Firesticks in ant nests is all I'm saying about that.
