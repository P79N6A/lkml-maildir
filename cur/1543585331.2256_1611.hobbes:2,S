Please quote chapter and verse.
I'm looking at 
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/write.html
 
and cannot see anything which states that write may not return having 
written fewer data than it was asked to.
The only vaguely relevant text I see is...
	Write requests to a pipe or FIFO will be handled the same as a
	regular file with the following exceptions:
	<...>
	* If the O_NONBLOCK flag is clear, a write request may cause the 
	  thread to block, but on normal completion it will return
	  nbyte.
This being an _exception_ clearly implies that for file descriptors other 
than pipes and fifos, it is _not_ necessary to return nbyte on normal 
completion.
Applications (and also I believe glibc) which assume otherwise are, 
technically, broken. Despite being numerous.
