The user-space won't, but the kernel exit path might.  Remember that
most compatibility syscalls go straight to the 64-bit syscall
handlers.  You're probably hosed anyhow if a 64-bit syscall returns,
say, 0x1ffffffff, but on ia64 I'd still rather play it safe and
consistently have all compatibility syscalls return a 64-bit
sign-extended value like all other syscall handlers ("least surprise"
principle).
