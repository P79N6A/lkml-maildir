Doesn't this depend on if we are talking about NOR or NAND memory? It
looks like you are describing some kind of NAND memory. Also I guess
it varies with manufacturer.
When it comes to CF the internal block size doesn't really matter
because the CF controller will hide it for you. The controller will
perform some kind of mapping between the 512 byte based IDE-interface
and it's internal sector size. This together with wear levelling.
The quality of the wear levelling will probably vary, but I guess even
the most primitive brands have something to cope with the fact that
the blocks containing the FAT are often rewritten on FAT filesystems.
