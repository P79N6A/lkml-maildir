I guess it's because of stupid design of ext2 indirect blocks. Indirect
blocks are scattered over that 1G. Imagine how long it would take to read
4M of non-contignuous blocks in 1G file. When you delete it immediatelly,
it's probably still in buffers. 
It would be much better to have pairs (position,length) instead of list of
all blocks. This would
- speed up bmap
- save disk space
- speed up delete & truncate
