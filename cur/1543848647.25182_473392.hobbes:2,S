Hi,
the hwrandom with intel_rng seems to be broken at least on 2.6.18;
Chipset is an E7520 on a SE7520JR2 board; Dual Intel Xeon 3.0 GHz CPU
running in 64bit mode. The output of /dev/hw_random consists entirely
of '1's.
dmesg says:
Intel 82802 RNG detected
hexdump of the data:
0000000 ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff ffff
Is this a known problem?
Cheers,
M
