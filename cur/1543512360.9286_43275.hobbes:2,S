so far, it is the only solution that has been accomplished other than bad mouthing
it because some people don't like it.  if it isn't perfect we work on it.  linux
isn't perfect but we improve it constantly.  should we delete linux because it isn't
the best solution?

seems like a fair lack of excitement here.  or was it supposed to do something

hmmm.  perhaps i'm missing something.
> OK, how many _different_ kinds of devices do you plug into it?
take a lab with lots of laptops, lots of portable things that plug into either
laptop or desktop, you know, disks, mice, modems, etc, multiply that by the number
of people walking around.
even that it happens for just one device for just one person in that office for just
a few times that day, that's why "hotswap" is so convenient.
should we have the NT version of pcmcia or the hotswap version?

i take my favorite usb mouse with me because it's the only one i have with a wheel.
i plug it in and go, NO changes needed in the already running X system.  i can
unplug it and use the glidepoint in the keyboard if i don't have my mouse with me.
i don't want to have to run scripts to reset everything every time i change
something.
it's called "user friendly"  not "this is unix so it'll work but you have to do
everything before i'll let it work"

what if update goes missing or breaks, what if what if what if.  what if the cpu
goes missing or breaks.
that's as logical as saying what if the password file disappears so we shouldn't use
a password system.

that devfs is a bloated mess to you is a beautiful convenience for the next guy.

nothing has changed in the unix way i manage devices other than i spend less time
doing it.

all of this talk about permissions and we skirt over the fact that tty permissions
change for every use.  nothing persistent there, all managed dynamically and by
policy, by the devices accessing them.

it is not beyond the intelligence of this community to design a persistent structure
available at boot time.

capabilities aren't exactly centered in the scope of devfs.  bringing up root-less
systems is a good point.  without a single bit of media, i already have a working
/dev

policy can be dictated from userspace.  not handling.  same goes for permissions.
policy is handled by userland.  save for policy set in /proc, the kernel doesn't
care what uid/gid/perms you place on a device, it only enforces them.

have you had 200 active users on your system and found that you're out of ttys due
to the structure?  you keep trying to say things are a moot point because you
haven't reached that limitation.  other people have.

how much is too much time?  i don't think my shop policy should be dictated by you.
if i can shave 5 minutes off the workload of six employees per day, that's two and a
half hours per week.  it is certainly of worth to me.

in one word, a much higher level of accuracy being that the admins don't do it so
they don't make typos or assign wrong values.
i don't rely on m$ to assure me of security, neither do i rely on rpms to dictate
how things go on my network.  if i counted all the exploits and vulnerabilities due
to poorly setup packages and policy dictated "for the mass" i could count dozens of
times when my network remained secure from exploitation and distributions madly
whipped up a patch.
in a parallel, we have dhcp.  i used to use the argument of why we shouldn't use
dhcp because my scripts worked just dandy.  when you're managing enterprise
networks, you DON'T have time to run things this way.  luckily i stopped being
stubborn and learned better ways.

ttys comes to mind.

it shows that the current implementation didn't match the requirements.  i have no
doubt that the two could bring their heads together and make magic happen.
there is always version 1 of a concept.  and invariable, version 2 and so on.
if we insist on never putting concepts into the kernel because they aren't perfect,
then we'll never get anywhere.
