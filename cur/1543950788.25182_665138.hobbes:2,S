Well, that would be a problem for suspend/hibernation if there were SCHED_FIFO
non-freezable tasks bound to the nonboot CPUs.  I'm not aware of any, but ...
Also, it should be possible to just offline one or more CPUs using the sysfs
interface at any time and what happens if there are any RT tasks bound to these
CPUs at that time?  That would be the $subject problem, IMHO.
Anyone who made the change affecting __migrate_task() so it's unable to migrate
RT tasks any more should have fixed the CPU hotplug as well.
