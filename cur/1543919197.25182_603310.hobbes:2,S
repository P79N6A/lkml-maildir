Ok, I agree with all of the above :)

I agree.

Yes, I think that's pretty much fixed now.

Huh?  Why would you want a kobject to not show up in sysfs?
And yes, I agree we could use some more "automatic" help in regards to
symlinks in sysfs when we change kobjects around.  That would make
things simpler for the kobject core.

I don't want to have non-attribute files, that's my main point here.

Ok, yes, at the very base level, it is, you are correct :)

i agree.
