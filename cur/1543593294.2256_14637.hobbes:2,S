If you are fragmenting messages then you want to optimise the protocol a bit
more. IP fragmentation increases processing overheads and reduces performance
badly in the presence of link congestion and error.
Most modern file sharing protocols are TCP based for good reason

Not on a socket. On a file it makes very little difference. Socket readv/writev

True. The single unix specification does not include preadv(). Really you want
to take it up with the Opengroup. That said Linux does add syscalls that are
not in SuS sometimes.

Welcome to PC hardware. Large amounts of PC hardware genuinely has limitations
of this nature. Most disk controllers can only write whole sectors on a sector
alignment. Many network controllers can only handle burst or 32bit alignment
policies
