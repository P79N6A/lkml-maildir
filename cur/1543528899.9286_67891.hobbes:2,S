Hmm, remember ISA DMA ? ;-)

Historical note: on ATM, we tried several things to deal with large
skbs (the IP over ATM default MTU is ~9 kB, and the worst-case
packet size is even 64 kB), while avoiding extra copying. This was one
such attempt. Well, perhaps unsurprisingly, it didn't work all that
well. The current wisdom is to allocate a pool of receive buffers that
are then memcpy'd to the real skbs :-(
