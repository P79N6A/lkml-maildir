Well it is bsg , setting BLK_DEV_BSG=n fixed all this errors.
Maybe a bit off topic but it depends on EXPERIMENTAL so why the the menu
is not telling this ? and why the default is 'y' for it ?
IMO everything depends on EXPERIMENTAL should
1) Tell it is EXPERIMENTAL ( visible to the user in menu ) " Foo New
stuff ( EXPERIMENTAL ) "
2) Should not default to 'y' , is up to the users/admins to set
EXPERIMENTAL things to Y/M , isn't it ?
( PS: there are even defconfigs with EXPERIMENTAL things set to y but
this is really off topic )
