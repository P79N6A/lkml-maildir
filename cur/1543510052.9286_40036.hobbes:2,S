The original purpose of the dummy interface was to only work from inside
the host.
Thus, the original claim is true, and was the way that it worked (in to
whatever the current kernel was when I submitted it in Summer 1994).
It was only later that it was used to provide poor mans virtual hosting.
To make it work from the outside, proxy arp entries had to be added for
the IP address.
