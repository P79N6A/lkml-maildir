There was another problem with the fscache code as well.  Also, this was
reported the day before yesterday and got no response.  Also, the other
patch that added EXPORT_SYMBOL(copy_page) "recently" was from
December, *2007* ... Also, this is 2.6.30 material and they have a long
time to fix it.
Also, it is much easier on me :-)
