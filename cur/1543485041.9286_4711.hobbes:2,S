Ever since I ran 2.1.129 or so, when I use a web browser, I need to go to
any page twice, before it comes up, otherwise it just sits there. I'm also
not able to retreive mail with fetchmail since 2.1.129, but if I reboot
with 2.0.36, I can get it fine. I've noticed the same problem from 2.1.129
-> 2.2.1
anyone know how to fix this?
