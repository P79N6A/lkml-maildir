Great.  Thanks a lot!
Where would I be able to download the patch that you guys will be producing
once it's through QA?  At 
ftp://ftp.namesys.com/pub/reiserfs-for-2.4/
 or is
there some other place I can get it (e.g. BK/CVS/HTTP/FTP) before it's
posted at that link?
Thanks,
Alex

Subject: Re: ReiserFS patch for updating ctimes of renamed files
I looked again at the definition of the difference between ctime and
mtime on the stat man page, and I think that updating ctime in response
to rename is as reasonable as updating it in response to changing the
number of links.
Ok, we will conform, and I will accept the kindly donated patch, along
with Andrew's optimization of our evaluation of CURRENT_TIME.  vs,
please add Andrew's suggested optimization and sent the result through
QA.  Thanks to all for your good advice.
