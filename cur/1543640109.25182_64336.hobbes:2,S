Ignore the above bit, I missed that you are already using two
independent addresses (in edx and edi), so atomicity is not an issue.
It might be cleaner to use a single address pointing to two consecutive
words anyway (for CLONE_SETTID and CLONE_VM_RELEASE) just to save a
register for future use - register pressure around clone() being a
precious thing, occasionally.
