(uptime of the machine is 81 hours longer than power on hours of the
disk. Seems that there is a small discrepancy... Hmm. Just checked:
The disk looses one hour every week)
I think that "Power on hours value = 084" means that the disk thinks
that it's seen about 1/6th of it's lifetime. The number seems to drop
by one about once every month.
