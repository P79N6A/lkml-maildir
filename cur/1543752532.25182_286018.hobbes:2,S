I know you are deliberately vague in the faq ;) But what about something like 
X11? It needs the real config.h in order to build the kernel DRM drivers. 
Should it be built against
 1) llh + blank config.h
 2) llh + real config.h
 3) kernel source
I guess this ambiguity would go away once the real kernel headers have been 
sanitized for userspace (ie we could always use the real config.h without 
fear of breakage) But as you have already stated, the issues are complex, and 
consensus is lacking. The longer the status quo continues, the more apps are 
going to break when we do get round to it.
And I think, in this instance, the "shut up and hack" response is 
inappropriate; Either these changes come from a senior linux hacker, or they 
will be ignored/derided (again).
