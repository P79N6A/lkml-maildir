AFAIK, the usual reason gcc can generate better code when you write
   bool = complex conditional
   if (bool) ...
is because of C's short-circuit conditional evaluation rules for || and &&.  By
moving the complex expression to an assignment statement, you are telling
gcc that it is okay and safe to evaluate every part of the expression.
If gcc was smart about being able to prove that all parts of the complex
expression where safe (no possibly null pointer references) and had no
side effects, then it could generate the same code with
  if (complex conditional) ...
However, there are many situations where even a magical compiler
couldn't prove that there were no possible side effects, etc., and would
have to generate multiple conditional branches to properly meet the
short-circuit conditional evaluation rules for && and ||.
However, in the specific cases in this thread using FWINV without
|| and && operators, an optimizing compiler "should" be smart enough
to generate more linear code for today's heavily pipelined CPUs.
For now, I guess it's still the duty of the programmer to use coding
style to force the compiler to generate more linear machine code.
