No, that's not why the folding was done.  You could have asked me
first....
First of all, I wasn't worried about simple correlations.  There are
enough statistical tests done that we don't need to worry about xor
causing problems.
The real issue is discarding information.  By folding, we hide
information about the output of the SHA hash that will hopefully deny
information that a Very Sophisticated Attacker (say, at the level of a
certain agency that designed the SHA algorithm) that might make it
easier for them to attack the SHA algorithm.

Speed really doesn't matter here.  /dev/random is supposed to produce
somethign which is close to true randomness, not crypto
psuedo-randomness.  So overkill is a good thing.  It should only be
used for generating long-term keys, so speed is really not a concern.
