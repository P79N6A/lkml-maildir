Hmmm. I saw "dbench 32" results of 73 MB / second using Linux
software RAID-0 and IDE.  However, I suppose some of that 
was due to caching, and not hardware throughput.
Details: 2.4.9-ac17, 4 x Maxtor 5400 RPM, 60 GB hard drives, 
2 x Promise TX-2 controllers, using UDMA-100, one drive / cable,
dual PIII-800, reiserfs, RAID - 0 with chunk-size = 1024
