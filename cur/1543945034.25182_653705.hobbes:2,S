Please add v4l-dvb tree, at:
ssh://master.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mchehab/linux-next.git
The above tree has two branches: 'master' and 'stable'
Both branches will have V4L/DVB next patches. The first is against your master,
and the second, against your stable.
I've opted to have both trees, since probably 'stable' is the better option for
you to clone. On the other hand, 'master' allow me to foresee if an "alien"
patch would conflict with a subsystem patch.
Cheers,
Mauro
