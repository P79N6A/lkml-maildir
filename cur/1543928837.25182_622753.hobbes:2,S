Looking at inode.c in 2.6.23-mm1, in generic_forget_inode, I see code:
	if (!hlist_unhashed(&inode->i_hash)) {
		if (!(inode->i_state & (I_DIRTY|I_SYNC)))
			list_move(&inode->i_list, &inode_unused);
so it looks to me like:
   If the inode is hashed and dirty, then move it (off the s_dirty
   list) to inode_unused.
So it seems to me that generic_forget_inode also finds it needs to
remove the inode from the dirty list when setting I_WILL_FREE.
Maybe we are looking at different kernel versions?  Maybe I
misunderstood your problem?
