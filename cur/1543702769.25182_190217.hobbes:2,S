Fine, but there are a lot of USB keyboard that _work_ that way, where
the "103rd" key is really positioned as the one and the only one '# key.
And the current stable X release does NOT know about the new scancode.
You realize that you intentionaly broke compatibility within a stable
kernel release?

*May* be a nice feature, but such things require better planning.
