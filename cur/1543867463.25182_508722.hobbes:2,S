I presume you mean the MPI library specifically?  If so, then yes.  It's
necessary to do DSA signature verification (or RSA for that matter).

Existing signature things?  I know not of such beasts, nor can I see them
offhand.

Hashing, yes; encryption, yes; signature checking: no from what I can see.
It's possible that I can share code with eCryptFS, though at first sight that
doesn't seem to overlap with what I want to do.
