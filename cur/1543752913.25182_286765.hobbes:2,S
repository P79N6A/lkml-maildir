: Could you try booting with acpi=off and without PNP compiled in? And maybe
: with pci=routeirq
Ok, I tried all them individually (hope you didn't mean all at once).  pnp
and pci=routeirq had no effect.  acpi got it to work again but sacrificed 
my second HT cpu and battery monitoring.  I'm going to try to turn acpi on
and pnpacpi off in the kernel and see if that helps.  I'll then try Alan's
patch and see what happens there
