I see it differently:  If it's possible for the driver to protect the
user, and it does not, then it strikes me as irresponsible programming.  If
there is a reason other than 'only elite users are cool enough to tune
their system, and they never make mistakes', then that's ok, but I have
not heard that argument yet.
Of course, I'd love it if the HD driver automatically brought it over
4MBps (it's 7200 RPM, for goodness sake!!).  (It sounds like, from
reading the hdparm man page, that my HD should do at least 20MBps..)
Either way, I've said my piece, and will go back to wrestling with
why my network/overall performance is sucking so badly all of a sudden...
Enjoy,
Ben
