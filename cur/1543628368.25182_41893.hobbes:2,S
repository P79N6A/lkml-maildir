I tried drbd and enbd, in both cases I got an oops when trying to
access the block-device (using 2.4.18-ac3).  But following a previous
thread about eNBD drbd seems to be working fine with plain 2.4.18. So
of course, both may be an option...
Basically, I tried nbd because it seemed pretty stable when compared
to the other solutions - except for the issues I mentioned.
