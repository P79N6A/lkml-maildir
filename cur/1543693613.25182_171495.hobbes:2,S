Hello all!
The latest and greatest (105 pages ...) version of OSDL CGL
V2.0 Requirements Definition has been ratified and is now
available from OSDL web site:
http://www.osdl.org/docs/carrier_grade_linux_requirements_definition___version_20.pdf
Like earlier, there is also an unofficial "txt"-version available:
http://developer.osdl.org/dev/cgl/cgl_req_v2.0.txt
(that is a raw text dump, so formatting is definitely broken)
For those who care, there is also a press release:
http://www.osdl.org/newsroom/press_releases/2003/2003_10_09_beaverton.html
Like always, all feedback is welcome!
