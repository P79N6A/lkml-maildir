It's not about Aunt Tilly, it's about an average systems administrator 
compiling his own kernel.
And there are already too many options visible, and the result are real 
world problems - I've seen it too often that someone didn't compile the 
support for his IDE chipset into the kernel. And this specific patch is 
only a small part of the general issue.
The situation was different if only developers and distributions would 
compile kernels, but that's not what's happening in the real world. 
Kernel developers are only a tiny minority amongst the people 
configuring and compiling their own kernel.
And if the "compile coverage" point was meant seriously, we'd also need 
some dummy #define's for getting all currently BROKEN_ON_SMP options 
compiling with CONFIG_SMP=y since in my experience they are getting
nearly zero compile coverage since it seems the "compile coverage" crowd 
only blindly runs allmdconfig/allyesconfig.
I'm often reporting and sometimes fixing compile errors, but that's OK.
Compile errors are really obvious errors (compared to e.g. runtime 
corruptions), and therefore not a real problem.
