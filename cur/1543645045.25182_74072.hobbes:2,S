It's not aimed at any specific hba driver, it could be any. 253 would be
over the top for any of them, it just so happens that aic7xxx has this
as the default :-)
So while it is definitely not the aic7xxx driver doing the starvation
(it's the device), the aic7xxx driver is (_in my oppinion) somewhat at
fault for setting it so high _as a default_.
Hopefully that's the end of this thread :)
