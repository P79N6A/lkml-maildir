I do believe that by 0.1*K everyone means a basic unit of 0.1 K, i.e. with
an int of 1 meaning 0.1 Kelvin, analogically 0.01*K meaning an int of 1
means 0.01 Kelvin - hence the proper names of deci and centi-Kelvins.
Perosnally I believe we should take normal (32 bit) ints (perhaps more on
64bit architectures?) and encode using 0.001*K (i.e. miliKelvins),
I do believe space is not an issue here and this leaves us the most
precision and logical system - Farenhait is screwed, and
Celsius/Centigrade are not to good since don't begin at absolute zero.
Anyway just my two cents.
Maciej.
