Since this is meant as a stop gap patch, waiting for a real
solution, and is only relevant for big (and rare) systems,
it would be an idea to at least leave it off by default.
I think it would be safe to assume that a $100k system has
a system administrator looking after it, while a $5k AMD64
whitebox might not have somebody watching its performance.
