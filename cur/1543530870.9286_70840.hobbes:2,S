No I'm not. Linux doesn't have the reliability yet. Cray UNICOS has
been used to control nukes though (or so I've been told).

NO not everyone. It is done when management decides that it is too
expensive to avoid it, and when it is determined not to be life
threatening.
Look how upset the FAA gets when the air traffic system dies. That was/is
based on an old production system (more batch than interactive).
Now nobody is saying they are planning to use Linux for that, but it is
a counterexample.
