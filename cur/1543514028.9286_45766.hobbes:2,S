	Yes, and Linus has asked me to support  MAP_PRIVATE
	512 byte aligned offsets at my Large File {Support|Summit} code.
	( e.g. max supported offset at 32-bit systems is now
		 +- 512*2G =  +- 1TB    )
	( My initial thinking was to use PAGE_SIZE shift, e.g. 4k*4G for
	  ia32 -- yielding 0..16 TB as offset range, but using signed
	  offsets at cache has its uses for i-node specific metadata )
	There exists a problem somewhere deep in generic
	block_read_full_page() code.  From my diff:
	( fs/buffer.c )
// FIXME: To support Linus' desire for 512 byte aligned mmap(MAP_PRIVATE)
// FIXME: Windows binaries, this function will need to support page-in from
// FIXME: non-page-aligned offsets within the file...
int block_read_full_page(struct file * file, struct page * page)
.....
	If you can help (e.g. have time, and interest - or vice versa ;) ),
	my "compiles but haven't dared to boot" for 2.3.23 is available at
	
ftp://mea.tmt.tele.fi/linux/LFS/
	For that matter, adding a more strict:
		MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_DENYWRITE
	test is trivial ( mm/mmap.c: do_mmap() )
 
-	if (off & ~PAGE_MASK)
+	if ((flags & MAP_TYPE) != MAP_PRIVATE) {
+	  if ((long)off & ~PAGE_MASK) /* Page Aligned ? */
 		return -EINVAL;
+#if PGOFF_SHIFT == 9
+	} else {
+	  if ((long)off & 511) /* Not 512 byte aligned; special support
+				  mode for WINE in ia32/ia64 platforms */
+		return -EINVAL;
+#endif
