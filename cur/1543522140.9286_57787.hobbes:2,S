When I was writing "Linux IP Stacks Commentary" for CoriolisOpen books, I 
discovered that in 2.0.34 the kernel TCP/IP code was inconsistent about 
whether to write fragments in reverse order or forward order.
In the "every other fortnight" department, if you run out of memory during 
a fragmentation procedure, the fragmentation process...stops.  You end up 
with orphan fragments out on the net.  Once 2.4 is out, I'm going to 
propose some patches to take care of this condition (assuming that someone 
else hasn't beat me to it).  The proposed change would be to save the 
fragments until the skbuffs have been built, THEN insert the fragments onto 
the device output queue.  That way, if you run out of memory you don't send 
anything at all, and you have less dead traffic.
In the same vein, I would also propose that some SMTP and/or /proc counters 
be implemented to count the total number of memory-out conditions 
encountered by the networking software; right now it happens silently so 
there is no way for the sysadmin to be aware there are any problems.  (I 
prefer that to generating a syslog message because the admin can write his 
own userland stuff to track any memory problems.)
