I've tested the "0f 1f 00" 3-byte NOP on two PIIs,
a Klamath (family 6 model 3 stepping 4) and a Deschutes
(family 6 model 5 stepping 0), and it worked fine on both.
Are you absolutely sure it's this 3-byte NOP that oopses?
I also noticed that jamal's /proc/cpuinfo contains
> cpu MHz         : 1063.771
which is either wrong or indicates serious overclocking.
The PIIs maxed out at about 400/450MHz.
