Final comparison for the evening: a PIII looks very different, since the
system call overhead is much smaller to begin with. On a PIII, the above
ends up looking like
   gettimeofday() testing:
	sysenter:	561.697236 cycles
	int/iret:	686.170463 cycles
			124.473227 cycles diff
	factor 1.221602
ie the speedup is much less because the original int/iret numbers aren't
nearly as embarrassing as the P4 ones. It's still a win, though.
