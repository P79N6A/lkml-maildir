Hello!
I have an interesting message within my log files for a small file
server running 2.6.21-rc4.  The message is "rpcsvc: received unknown
control message:-2144988692/-1" of which there are quite a few.  I
tried to google around for this but found nothing.  Any help from the
experts?  The machine in question is a dual dual opteron 2.2GHz w/4G
RAM, 3Ware 9650 (14 disk RAID 10), LVM2, XFS file system.  I have
installed and using the latest nfsutils (1.0.12).  I have grabbed some
ethereal and can see nothing unusual.  Any help would be greatly
appreciated!
TIA,
Phy
