Just to be clear, I didn't mean that in any bad way, just that sometimes 
a new format, even if correct and unambiguous, looks strange to the eye 
and is not used just because it jars. I still think putting 
initialization for a loop in the start of the for is defensive 
programming, perhaps I've had too many bumblers inherit my code.
