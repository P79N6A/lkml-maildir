        Hi, I hope you find this informative.
        I recently bought an Abit BP6 and am trying to get my drives
working with it at UDMA(33) speeds.  I keep on getting these errors:
hdb: timeout waiting for DMA
hdb: irq timeout: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hda: DMA disabled
hdb: DMA disabled
ide0: reset: success
whenever I try to write large amounts of data to /dev/hdb.
Here are some "interesting" clippings of boot sequences and other things.
(from dmesg)
hda: ST36450A, 6149MB w/448kB Cache, CHS=784/255/63, DMA
hdb: Maxtor 92048D8, 19531MB w/512kB Cache, CHS=39683/16/63, UDMA(33)
hdc: IBM-DJAA-31700, 1628MB w/96kB Cache, CHS=3308/16/63, DMA
hdd: ATAPI 24X CD-ROM drive, 128kB Cache, DMA
(from dmesg)
Partition check:
 hda: hda1
 hdb: hdb1
 hdc:hdc: timeout waiting for DMA
hdc: irq timeout: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hdc: timeout waiting for DMA

 [PTBL] [827/64/63] hdc1
(from hdparm -t /dev/hda)
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  32 MB in  3.73 seconds = 8.58 MB/sec
(from hdparm -t /dev/hdb)
/dev/hdb:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  32 MB in  1.67 seconds =19.16 MB/sec
As you can tell, I bought /dev/hdb for SPEED :) It'd be nice to be able to
capture video to it.  Make It Go(tm) ? :)
