Subject: [PATCH 000 of 3] md: Introduction - assorted fixed for 2.6.16
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Following are three patches for md.  The first fixes a problem that
can cause corruption in fairly unusual circumstances (re-adding a
device to a raid1 and suffering write-errors that are subsequntly
fixed and the device is re-added again).
The other two fix minor problems
The are suitable to go straight in to 2.6.17-rc.
