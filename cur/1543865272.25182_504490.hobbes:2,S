I don't think there's much point in knowing if we have overrun(s). 
We're not going to schedule the timer any differently. We want to keep 
the timer interrupts as consistent as possible according to the user's 
request.

Ok, we'll look at the fallback option you suggest.  I don't recall if I 
even knew about ppc_proc_freq before or why I originally chose 
cpufreq_guick_get.  Maybe we can do without the cpufreq and use 
ppc_proc_freq all the time.  We'll see . . .

Well, exact frequency isn't critical, but it should, as close as 
possible, correspond with the user's requested value for "spu cycle reset".

I've got to rework this implementation anyway . . .
