This is another case of "perfect is the enemy of good".
Tryng to reach perfect is not only guaranteed to fail, but trying to reach 
it AND NOT REALIZING that it's stupid and wrong is actually much WORSE 
than just trying to do a reasonable job.
And if you put some _totally_idiotic_ expectation that all bugreports can 
be fixed, and should always be totally blocking, that's guaranteed to just 
cause a totally unusuable bug reporting system.
And your bugzilla arguments seem to be exactly that. A naïve and totally 
unrealistic expectation of "every bugreport is sacred" is BAD.
In other words: perfection not only isn't even possible, BUT IT IS NOT 
EVEN WORTH TRYING TO REACH FOR!
