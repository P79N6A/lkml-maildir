is not really a missing improvement; it's a geniune undefined behaviour.
temp[] is uninitialized, then you copy there some data that doesn't have
to contain NUL, then you call sscanf().  Boom.  The same goes for the rest
of similar places.
And this

is honest-to-$DEITY security hole - that file is world-readable and there's
nothing to prevent simple_read_from_buffer() blocking on page-in of buf,
then root writing to that file changing smack_net_ambient and doing kfree()
on the old value - one we'd already passed to simple_read_from_buffer().
At which point reader is about to get whatever data that might land in
whatever that memory gets reused for.
Besides, as I said the last time, smack_net_ambient has every right to
get changed between strlen() and passing argument to simple_read_from_buffer(),
in which case you'll be copying the amount of data that used to be in the
old one, taking it from the new one.  New one might very well be shorter.
