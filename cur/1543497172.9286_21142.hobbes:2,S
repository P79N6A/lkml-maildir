HP and one year later SGI have published papers about that topic on
USENIX.  They however are mostly tackeling the issue with TLB reloads
which severly can impact system performance for certain types of
workloads.
It's however not what I was refering to.  I want to see how changing the
the size of the basic page to a different value, something that affects
all processes and the kernel.
