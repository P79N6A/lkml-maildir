The only way I can see that being true is if some irq was keeping
the cache line warm for something in the process startup.
I have trouble seeing how adding 1K to an already 1K data structure
can cause a cache fault that wasn't happening already.

Which invalidates the tlb fault hypothesis unless it happens to lie
on the 2MB boundary.
