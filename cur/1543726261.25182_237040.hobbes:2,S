This is a hack introduced by someone years ago. The "pointer" is
actually an integer argument, e.g. in include/linux/dvb/audio.h:
#define AUDIO_SET_MUTE             _IO('o', 6)
actually takes an integer argument (!0 mute, 0 unmute), so one can write
	if (ioctl(fd, AUDIO_SET_MUTE, 1) == -1)
		perror("mute");
It is unusual (maybe even wrong?), but we cannot change it without
losing binary API compatibility. However, I see that sparse might
flag this as a possible bug :-(
