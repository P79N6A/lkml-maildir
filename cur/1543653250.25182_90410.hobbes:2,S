No, you need to move the IP-address from the old nfs-server to the new
one. Then to the clients it will look like a regular reboot. (Check out
heartbeat, at 
http://www.linux-ha.org/
)
You need to make sure that NFS is using the shared ip (the one you move
around) rather than the fixed ip. (I assume you will have a fixed ip on
each host in addition to the one you move around). Also, you need to put
/var/lib/nfs on shared stoarage. See the archive for more details.
