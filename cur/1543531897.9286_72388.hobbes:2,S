Maybe I am being stupid, but where is the superfluous loop? Remember,
as I just pointed out, 2.3.43 had the same loop, are you claiming it 
was buggy even then?

Can you explain how this is happening? I can see that in your patch,
kswapd does not go thru the loop if need_resched is set, but with
a single node, 3 zones, I would find it hard to explain such a 
difference.

What latency problem? I still believe that the pre3 code is doing
the right thing, assuming 2.3.43 was doing the right thing.
