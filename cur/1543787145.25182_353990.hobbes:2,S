Hi all,
Just a quick question: How can a user-mode application ensure that an
AIO write on a raw block device (i.e. open()ed with O_DIRECT) has
really -really- been written to the disk and not residing in an on-disk
write cache where it could be lost in case of a power failure? Is
physical write guaranteed to have taken place before the AIO
completion? Or is there a system call that sends a cache flush
command to the drive (and waits for the drive to commit)?
