Considering this possible volatility I'm not certain we really need this 
in the kernel.
The other point is that I have problems imagining, that this should be 
enough to edit random text files with a random editor without problems. 
Especially cursor positioning becomes a whole lot more complex and the 
editor has to do exactly the same parsing as the kernel, i.e. changes to 
this table are not easily possible anymore or later you may need to add 
the possibility to read the table.
OTOH if the editor has to all this parsing anyway, the whole thing could 
be pushed to userspace and the Linux terminal could be marked as handling 
all characters equally (a good hint would be if the terminal doesn't even 
support wide characters). The terminfo database exists for a good reason 
and a good editor has to support a wide range of terminals anyway, so I 
don't really see the problem as to mark variable width characters as not 
supported and keep the kernel implementation sane and simple.
bye, Roman
