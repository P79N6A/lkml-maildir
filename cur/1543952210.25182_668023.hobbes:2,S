I strongly disagree.  Cheap PC hardware is not even close to the quality
of a serious, branded machine.  Often capacitors are missing from power
lines, and the ones that are installed fail sooner.  Cooling fans are
lower quality and fail much sooner.  Timing issues abound.
There's a reason why an IBM is a better machine than a "Black-n-Gold":
IBM value their name so when you have a problem, they have a problem. 
Buy generic and when you get a problem they already have your money and
since they have no investment in their name, they have nothing more to
care about.
