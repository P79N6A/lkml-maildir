Please follow the link I posted earlier (and repeated below) to the
linux-privs (capabilities)  info.  To quote: 
"At the heart of the changes to the Linux kernel from the historical model
is the separation of identity and privilege."
Pretty much the opposite of what you're saying.
Note: the capabilities stuff is a little complex, esp. wrt file cap sets,
process cap sets, and the way caps are passed on during an exec.  Even the
available documentation isn't completely clear to me, and now it's time to
read the code, too.  You may misunderstand, too, that capabilities and
their behavior are _already_ coded in the kernel; we're just trying to
make use of a kernel feature that's already present, but not currently in
use due to lack of support in the fs.
For your elucidation:
