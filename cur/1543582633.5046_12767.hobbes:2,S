Hi,
free is not an interesting command. Much more interesting is the kernel
messages on boot, e.g. on my laptop it looks like this:
BIOS-provided physical RAM map:
 BIOS-e820: 000000000009fc00 @ 0000000000000000 (usable)
 BIOS-e820: 0000000000000400 @ 000000000009fc00 (reserved)

as you can see, the above tells you exactly how many pages you have in
each zone and the total number of usable pages. But even that is not
relevant to your question. What is relevant is the number after the first
"/" in the "Memory:" line and also the BIOS-e820 map, of course.
Also, on 6.4G machine you should definitely use 64G i.e. PAE support and
so if not all memory is detected, please report to this list. People like
David Parsons will probably be interested in your configuration...

Tigran
