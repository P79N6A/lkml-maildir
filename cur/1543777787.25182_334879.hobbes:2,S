Sorry, I don't understand this last paragraph.
I don't see how it's more simple with two devices (vs three) if
we don't exactly know which device caused the error. I thought
one still needed to reset/restart both devices. Is that correct?
The devices operate asyncronously from the drivers.
Only the driver can tell us for sure if IO was in flight for a
particular device and decide that a device could NOT have generated
an error.
Otherwise, so far, the patches look fine to me.
thanks,
