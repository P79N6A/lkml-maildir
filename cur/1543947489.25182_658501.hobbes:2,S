It should be possible to use a modular jhash.ko.  The things which you
have identified as clients of the jhash library are usually loaded as modules.
But in the case where someone does (say) NFSD=y we do need jhash.o linked into
vmlinux also.  This is doable in Kconfig but I always forget how.  Adrian, Sam
and Randy are the repositories of knowledge here ;)
