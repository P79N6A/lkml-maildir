Please, can you explain me how can I do that ? BEcause when I'm starting 
with 2.6 kernel, it's hanging will starting, and when I'm starting with 
2.4.22 kernel, only informations about 2.4.22 is show by dmesg ...
(If the 2.6 can't mounty the /, maybe it's why it can't write 
information for dmesg on ?)
Here is what I can see on the screen :

That's all. I will try to modify the number of line of the screen in the 
bis for seeing more information, but I can't promise anythinks ...
