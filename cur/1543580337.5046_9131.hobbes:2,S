The code was broken, so I disabled it.
I
"fixed" WOL in the 2.2.19-pre candidate driver.  It's
at 
http://www.uow.edu.au/~andrewm/linux/3c59x.c-2.2.19-pre6-1.gz
I'd really appreciate it if you could test the WOL in
that driver.  Then we can port it into 2.4 and try to
fool Linus into thinking it's a bugfix :)
