In the binary only module, you would do it the right way by telling the
kernel to allocate a spinlock and pass back an opaque handle to it. You only
allocate space for the spinlock handle, which is basically a void *.
Then the kernel is allows to change the allocation attributes of a spinlock
whenever needed.

Which is why you should be using opaque objects to reference the spinlocks.

Or you start doing something that actually helps maintainability. You start
using something called abstraction. Provide opaque interfaces to the objects
rather than the raw structure. If you absolutely must have the penultimate
in speed, I suppose you could even define it such that the first elements of
the object is are function pointers for the various methods. Since many
processors now have a zero branch delay, there wouldn't be a performance hit
on those architechures.
None of these are really new ideas.
