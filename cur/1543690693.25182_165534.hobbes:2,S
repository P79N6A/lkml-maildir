Pardon my ignorance here, but the impression I get is that changing a 
page table entry is not as simple as just writing to a bit somewhere.  I 
suppose it is if the page descriptor is not loaded into the TLB, but if 
it is, then you have to ensure that the TLB entry matches the page 
table; this may not be a quick operation.
I can think of a lot of other possible complications to this.
