OK !! We have to find a way to do set_page_dirty() safely, I guess.

I don't follow you. In original code, we only reap the BIO's on which IO 
is complete. How is it controlling peak consumption ? 
Now, I give back the BIO as and when IO is complete. So it should be better
for consumption. Isn't it ?
