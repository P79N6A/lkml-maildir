Tha drivers/dma/ bits look ok to me minus the new warnings:
drivers/dma/ipu/ipu_irq.c: In function 'ipu_irq_fn':
drivers/dma/ipu/ipu_irq.c:328: warning: 'irq' may be used
uninitialized in this function
drivers/dma/ipu/ipu_irq.c: In function 'ipu_irq_err':
drivers/dma/ipu/ipu_irq.c:290: warning: 'irq' may be used
uninitialized in this function
I can take patches 1 and 2 through the async_tx tree, or if you would
rather, add my Acked-by to those and take 1-4 through the MXC tree.
I'll be sending the async_tx pull request for 2.6.29 in the next few
days.
Thanks,
Dan
