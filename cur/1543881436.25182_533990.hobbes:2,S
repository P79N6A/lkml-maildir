But maybe you don't want every single file in the directory, but some
subset of the files in the directory tree.  So before you know it:
sys_fs_sql("SELECT port,userid,daemon FROM /etc/inetd.conf.d "
	"WHERE protocol=='tcp'", buf, sizeof(buf));
The question is where do you stop on the slippery slope, and is it
really all that harder than simply parsing a /etc/gitconfig or
/etc/e2fsck.conf file.  There are plenty of parsers or database
libraries already written, and many of them are quite efficient.  And
personally, I'd much rather edit a single /etc/gitconfig or
/etc/e2fsck.conf file using emacs than have to cd through 3 or 4
levels of directories to edit each 2-3 byte file one at a time.  But
to each their own....
