Well gated is one of the things that should have been fixed a long time
ago. Advertising that it has a route on the same physical interface
is broken. This makes cooperating machines send packets to a machine
advertising such a route, only to have that machine send these packets
out the same physical link, duplicating traffic.

Correct on gated, we'll have to "agree to disagree" about the
mask.

Yes, BSD networking has a lot of baggage, but it became the de-facto
standard.

I can do that, but I have write code to reconfigure interfaces
during network routing changes (which I have done). Most would
like to rely on the de-facto standard tools of ifconfig and route.
---and I think you could help by deleting all instances of a route
when 'asked' by route.

Yes, and presently, I can add a specific 'network' route to the device
itself.. without regard to its address. Nice, but most don't know
these tricks.

Well thanks, again. Please give my suggestion a good look.
