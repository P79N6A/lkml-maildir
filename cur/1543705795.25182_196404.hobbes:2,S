No problems with keyboard, and the cpufreq works fine with the patch, but
not at all without the patch.
There are some ACPI related issues though, such as: via-rhine gets wrong 
irq with ACPI on, system hangs with yenta_socket loaded if I 
connect/disconnect the power cord... So for now, I don't use the PCMCIA.

Still, the max speed check should be safe. Maybe pass values as module
options too? I would not trust on ACPI working right on this machine :)
