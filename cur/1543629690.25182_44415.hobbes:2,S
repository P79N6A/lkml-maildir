The 2.5.7 worked reasonably well (for a few days, I think). Except that it
hung at one point and I decided to go back to 2.4.17. My plan was to try it
again with a newer kernel.
My system:
- MSI MSI K7T266 Pro, with an Athlon 1.3 GHz
- IBM Deskstar 60GXP, 40Gb using onboard IDE controller
- 3c900
- 3c905C
- Adaptec 2940
- Hauppauge Win/TV Theatre
- USB: Iiyama monitor, Dlink webcam
Shall I try to build with LK1.1.16?
