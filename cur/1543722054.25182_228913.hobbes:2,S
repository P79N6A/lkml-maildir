I bet that all this is not needed for you, now when you properly configured your system. 
1280x1024-60 just selects some videomode fbdev subsystem thinks your monitor should use,
while vesa:0x11A selects videomode I think you should use. And right/left/... modifies it
to match with your X setup. Maybe I made some math wrong somewhere if you see picture one
line lower. Try using upper=40 or 32 instead of 48 (or 47 if you are talking about
one pixel line, not about one character line).  All this is available in standard
kernel, and documented in matroxfb.txt.

Never. Main thing that patch does is resurrecting 2.4.x fbcon subsystem. And 2.6.x uses
its own, 2.6.x fbcon subsystem. So you can either use what's in the kernel (and I see no 
reason why in-kernel driver should not work for you if you do not need svgalib compatibility
or multihead system or different resolution on each virtual terminal), or you'll have to 
patch your kernel. Except resurrecting 2.4.x fbcon patch only adds support for native
text mode (which is impossible with new fbcon), but otherwise in-kernel and in-patch
drivers should be identical.
