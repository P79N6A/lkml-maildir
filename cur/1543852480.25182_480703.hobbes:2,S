Lmbench is broken in its fork time measurement.
It includes overhead time when it is pinning processes onto
specific cpu. The actual fork time is not affected by NR_IRQS.
Lmbench calls the following C library function to determine the 
number of processors online before it pin the processes: 
	sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN);
This function takes the same order of time to run as
fork itself.  In addition, runtime of this function 
increases with NR_IRQS.  This resulted in the change in
time measured.
After hardcoding the number of online processors in lmbench,
the fork time measured now does not change with CONFIG_NR_CPUS
for both 2.6.18 and 2.6.19-rc5.  So we can now conclude that
NR_IRQS does not affect fork.  We can remove this particular
issue from the known regression.
