   Let's see: on Itanium, a ld takes up an M slot and has a 2 cycle
   access latency (if in the first level cache).  This may or may not be
   noticable in benchmarks, but it certainly won't go faster.  And all
   this just for task coloring (which we can do with the old set up just
   fine)?
The compiler will schedule the latency out of existence.
