no, thats not the real reason. It's _not_ faster (definitely not in 2.2),
because all kinds of stuff has to be soft-reloaded and ltr isnt very fast
either. The real reason for doing soft-reloads is threefold:
	- exception handling wrt. segment reloading is simpler. It's
	  conceptually impossible to determine in a simple way what
	  caused an exception during a TSS switch. It's a 'too complex'
	  operation to be described with a simple fault. Soft-switching
	  sorts all the fault sources out nicely.
	- the number of TSSs per GDT is limited to 8192, which together
	  with the LDT entry (and a few other descriptors) constrained the
	  maximum number of processes/threads to 4000. Since early 2.3 we
	  have a per-CPU TSS, which is loaded only once at bootup, so
	  there is no ltr cost and no limitation (apart from RAM) on the
	  number of processes/threads.
	- since late 2.3 we have another feature: soft-TLB reloading,
	  which optimizes away the TLB-flush of system-threads. TSS
	  task-switching only knows about the 'dont flush if page tables
	  are identical between the previous and next task' optimization.
speed is a secondary reason.
