Ohh, I misinterpreted that rmb(), sorry. Somehow I gave it for granted
that it was a cross-CPU sync point (ala read_barrier_depends). If that's a
local CPU load ordering only, things are different, clearly. But ...

If a store buffer is shared between CPU_0 and CPU_1, it is very likely 
that a sync done on CPU_1 is going to sync even CPU_0 stores that are 
held in the buffer at the time of CPU_1's sync.
