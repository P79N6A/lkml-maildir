Basically nothing and it could be implemented, but IMO it would be a step
in a wrong direction.
Namely, we want the image-writing code to go to the user space in the long
run. Then, the whole suspend will be handled by a userspace process and the
kernel will not know what kind of storage this process is using (it may or
may not be a swap partition).  Consequently, the kernel will not know how
much space there is for the image, _unless_ the user space process tells it.
The user space process can do this _once_, using /sys/power/image_size
before it asks the kernel to create the image.  Next, the kernel creates
the image and swsusp_shrink_memory() is called in the process.  Of course
at this point the amount of available storage can change, but to know it
the kernel would have to ask the userspace process if that happened.
Generally speaking it can't do this, so it "returns" the image to the
userspace process which should verify if the image is small enough
and if not, repeat from writing /sys/power/image_size with a smaller
number or just fail (if so configured).

It's not a waste of time at all. :-)  IMO the issue is definitely worth
discussing.
