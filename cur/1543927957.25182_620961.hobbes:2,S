Completely ACK'ed.
Also keep in mind:
Andrew is going through all new bug reports.
People like Natalie or me also go through new bug reports.
Good bug reports are valuable contributions.
Bug reporters are humans.
In my experience, most bug reporters are more than willing to provide
any kind of information or testing when requested.
And not to forget:
All the problems with bug report quality are not better when the bug 
report comes via email.

Not automatically.
Often submitters answer the question that led to the NEEDINFO state but 
don't change the state.
And I know this, since going through all bugs in the NEEDINFO state and 
either closing them or removing the NEEDINFO is a simple and not too big 
task I'm sometimes doing.

Good idea ... for pissing off bug submitters.
We have many bug reports in the Bugzilla with very responsive submitters 
who wrote very good bug reports but have the bad luck that it's in an 
area without a maintainer looking after the bug.

You can also assign bugs for some component by default to some real or 
dummy address that forwards everything from the Bugzilla bug (starting 
with the initial bug report) to some mailing list.
And when people answer to this email, the answers will be tracked in 
Bugzilla.

It would be best if bugs would initially be entered in Bugzilla.
If you have a permanent cookie with the Bugzilla authentification in 
your browser the overhead of closing a bug is to click on the link in 
the Bugzilla email plus 2 clicks in the browser.
