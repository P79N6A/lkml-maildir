OK, here's the details you asked about:
Soundblaster Awe 32 sound card
Voodoo 3 pci video card
Running Xfree86-4.0.0 (rpms from 3dfx.com)
Playing unreal tournament, no special game
options, just 800x600 graphics @ 16 bits.
To recap, the symptoms (hung ps, etc) occurred
on kernel 2.4.1-pre8 + low latency patches. (but
I don't think the low latency patches had anything
to do with it, based on the other reports)
Hope this helps
