Also what you want already exists, so no need to modify the kernel,
the TCP_INFO socket option (netinet/tcp.h should have the required
definitions in recent glibc)
  struct tcp_info info;
  int optlen=sizeof(struct tcp_info);
  if(getsockopt(sk->fd,SOL_TCP,TCP_INFO,(void *)&info,&optlen) < 0)
    return;
  printf("unacked: %d sacked: %d lost: %d retrans: %d fackets: %d\n",
                info.tcpi_unacked,info.tcpi_sacked,info.tcpi_lost,
                info.tcpi_retrans,info.tcpi_fackets);
  printf("pmtu: %d rcv_ssthresh: %d rtt: %d rttvar: %d snd_ssthresh:
	%d\nsnd_cwnd: %d advmss: %d reordering: %d\n",info.tcpi_pmtu,info.tcpi_rcv_ssthresh,
  info.tcpi_rtt,info.tcpi_rttvar,info.tcpi_snd_ssthresh,info.tcpi_snd_cwnd,info.tcpi_advmss,
          info.tcpi_reordering)
There's a few more that I don't print there, see the header file.
