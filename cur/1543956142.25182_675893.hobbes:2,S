Jan, I tried the above patch on top of v2.6.25-rc8-82-g49115b7, and using
the same setup and workloads that produced the warning before: running "make
-j 20" of the linux kernel 100 times, dual-CPU, SMP, PREEMPT, while running
flush_cache every few seconds.  The entire run took over 12 hours.  I'm
happy to report that so far I've not gotten the same lockdep warning as
before.
Maybe this can now go to -mm for more testing?
Cheers,
Erez.
