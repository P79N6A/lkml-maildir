I don't think so, it would be slightly less latency, but as via-rhine needs
to copy the data anyway...

Yes _I_ have matured a bit =) And the new driver does not choose between
MMIO/PORTIO at runtime, because most other drivers seem to select this via
CONFIG_ directives.

I'll check that out, and if all works fine I'll release a patch. By the way,
how *do* you measure network performance the best way? What I have done now
is only to stress test the driver, by copying a 400MB file from my Windows
machine to /dev/null and at the same time recieving a 400MB file over FTP
from my Sun Sparc which is bridged on another via-rhine.
