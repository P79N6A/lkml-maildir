Impressive patch! On the other hand a lot of the interesting
data isn't it kmalloc anymore, but in slab. Does it really track
all that much? 
Also i'm not sure how you handle initializedness of DMAed data
(like network buffers). Wouldn't you need hooks into pci_dma_*
for this?
Your assumption that only the string instructions can take
multiple page faults seems a little dangerous too.
