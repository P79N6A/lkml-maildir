I have just looked up in glibc what architectures need this kind
of handling and found that there is no easy rule. The good news
is that none of (hppa m68k s390 sparc x86_64 alpha cris i386 sparc64 
arm ia64) are doing this. 
AFAICS, the padding is done for exactly these system calls:
ppc: truncate64, ftruncate64, pread64, pwrite64
mips: truncate64, ftruncate64, pread64, pwrite64
sh: pread64, pwrite64
fadvise64_64 is another story: 
mips does no padding, ppc32 reorders the arguments (int fd, int advise,
off64_t offset, off64_t len) and s390 passes a struct, for the
reason Uli already explained.
