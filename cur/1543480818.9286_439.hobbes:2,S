Hi Linus and list,
2.2.0-pre8 (official :-) hangs on boot while detecting scsi devices.
SysRQ-P shows the kernel spinning around in schedule(). Backing out the
changes to ncr53c8xx and scsi/scsi_obsolete does not change anything, so
I think it might be something more generic. According to the list this
problem shows up only on the Alpha architecture. I suspect the latest
semaphore changes to be responsible somehow, at least for alpha.
Gruss,
	Matthias
