You miss that there is a big difference between "beneficial" and "needs".
The latter is used when some assembly code has a specific knowlegde of
how parameters are passed or that the function signature for other good
reasons must not change.
It has nothing to do with "beneficial".
Any use of __always_inline outside arch/* is highly question able.
And most use of *inline* in drivers/* today is due to bad behaving gcc in the past.
