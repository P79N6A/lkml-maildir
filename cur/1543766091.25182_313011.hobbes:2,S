Hi guys,
One of Ben's patches ("ppc32: Fix cpufreq problems") went in 2.6.12-
rc3, but it depended on another patch that's still in -mm only: 
add-suspend-method-to-cpufreq-core.patch
In addition to this, there's a third patch in -mm that fixes warnings
and line length to the previous patch, but it doesn't apply cleanly
anymore. It's named add-suspend-method-to-cpufreq-core-warning-fix.patch
Here's an updated version. HTH,
