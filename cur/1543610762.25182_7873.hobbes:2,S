I've compiled 2.4.16-pre1 optimized for i386 instead of Athlon/Duron, and had no problem whatsoever booting. I'm now beating it a bit, compiling a kernel etc, but it appears to be rock solid.
This seems to suggest there is a problem in the Athlon/Duron optimization code.
Thanks François!
Bye for now,
