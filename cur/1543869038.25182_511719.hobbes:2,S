Far from it.  Try reading to the end.

The "intended spirit of the GPL" is very different from what you think
it is, as $674 million of Red Hat stock can testify.  It is also
utterly irrelevant except when the circumstances surrounding someone's
acceptance of the GPL indicate that the two parties negotiated more or
less directly before settling on its terms.

Of course.  They're distributing a derivative work of the kernel, or
perhaps even (for legal purposes) distributing Linus's work of
authorship with trivial editorial changes that do not create a new
copyrightable work.  They need license to do so, and the only license
on offer is GPL v2, which conditions the license on distribution of
source code.
