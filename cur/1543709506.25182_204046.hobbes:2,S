Hello,
I have a compaq smart2 array on EISA with 2 disk from which i boot. This 
worked fine om the 2.4 kernel. Now i need to run a 2.6 kernel but i got 
a kernel panic.
I looked at the driver(2.4.5) in the 2.6 kernel source and found out it 
was a call to the pci_dev->dma_mask that caused the problem. (line 397)
Is this driver supporting EISA bus? If not is this support comming back?
Greetings
