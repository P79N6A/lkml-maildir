Was this embedded outb to 0x80 for delay only? Maybe I'm wrong. But in the 
case above it forces the chipselect signal to deselect the hardware between 
the access to vidport and vidport+1. Some devices need this to latch the 
values correctly. Otherwise the chipselect signal would be active for all 
four accesses in the example above (and only data and addresses are changing 
from device's view).
