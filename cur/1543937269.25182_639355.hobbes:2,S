This seems to work, both the oops and the hang are gone. I get these
messages in syslog when the Bluetooth link hangs and I want to kill pppd
with "poff":
Jan 16 23:55:59 twister kernel: unregister_netdevice: waiting for ppp0 to become free. Usage count = 1
Jan 16 23:56:09 twister kernel: unregister_netdevice: waiting for ppp0 to become free. Usage count = 1
But a "killall -9 pppd" seems to help and then the re-connect (after the
phone got power-cycled) works.
