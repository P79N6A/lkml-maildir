I would expect the page size to rise as well. On IA64 we already have
16KB-64KB pages corresponding to 256TB - 1PB. Having to manage a couple of
billion pages could be a significant performance impact. Better increase
the page size.
I still would also like to see atomic64_t. I think there was a patch
posted to linux-ia64 a couple of months back introducing atomic64_t but it
was rejected since it would not be supportable on other arches.
