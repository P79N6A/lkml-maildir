I see the same kind of corruption on my board. As far as I know, since
enabling udma2 instead of letting the board goto it's default udma4, I
haven't had any of the corruption occur again.  This is better than pio
but obviously an annoyance. I'm using an abit KT7 board.  
ide chipset:
VP_IDE: VIA vt82c686b (rev 40) IDE UDMA100 controller on pci00:07.1
Perhaps we all see udma corruption due to it detecting an udma speed
that's not supported by our chipsets?  I know my manual says UDMA66 is
the highest for my board.
