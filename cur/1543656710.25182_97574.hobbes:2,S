OK. Since we are on the topic. I have some (intending to be) constructive
criticisms for the owners of the 2.5 kernel tracker site (not sure exactly 
who they are but I know mbligh is part of it).
Why are bugs automatically assigned to owners? 
	If there was an unassigned category that would make it 
	easy to query.
How else are those of us who want to help stabilize the 2.5 kernel supposed 
	to know which bugs are being worked on and which are not? 
	(Please dont tell me "email". Am I really supposed to email every 
	person who has a bug asking if they are really working on it or not?)
Could you make a list of all the people who have volunteered to be
	bugtracker maintainers and their respective kernel pieces. 
Also a list of people who arent maintainers but are available to help 
	could be useful for the owners to assign bugs to.
Thanks.
Hanna
