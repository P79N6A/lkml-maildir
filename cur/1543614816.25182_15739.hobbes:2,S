It _is_ a problem for me, because I want to do "diffstat" on a patch from
a PPC maintainer, and if I see anything non-PPC, loud ringing
noises go off in my head. I want that diffstat to say _only_
	arch/ppc/...
	include/asm-ppc/...
and nothing else. That way I know that I don't have to worry.
In contrast, if it starts talking about Documentation/Configure.help and
the main config file, I start worrying.
For example, that MATHEMU thing is just ugly. It was perfectly fine in the
per-architecture version, now it suddenly has magic dependencies just
because different architectures call it different things, and different
architectures have different rules on when it's needed.
