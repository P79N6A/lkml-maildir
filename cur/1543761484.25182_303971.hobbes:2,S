  Thank you very much.
  To be ugly or to never be up to date, that's the question.
  We did patch 8250_pci.c but there is no way to build a stable list of
the devices to be handled that way.
  We will thus spend some time on the hot unplug solution.
  This is my very last question: is there a script able to do that? Google
quotes their existence but no link found. Or a doc showing how to code
that in a program?
  Many many thanks - Jacques
