Yuckkkkk!

That's no biggie.

Which is why I think we should do the post asap (as you have). What is
counted as an essential thread?

All other threads will be frozen, and we don't have scheduler hooks that
will hang up our new kiddie, so we should be right there.

But also simplified by the fact that everything else is frozen.

Show us some code :>
