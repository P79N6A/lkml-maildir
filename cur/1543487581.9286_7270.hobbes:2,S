Actually, 3Com's muddied this a bit with their Hub 1000 SX Gigabit Ethernet
full-duplex repeater.  They pull this off by using some sort of round-robin
internal negotiation instead of CSMA/CD to give ports access to the internal
bus; but all traffic still goes out all ports.  I don't know much more about
it than that.  So you can't do full-duplex with CSMA/CD Ethernet (which was
your point, of course), but weird repeaters exist that avoid collisions and
can do full-duplex.
It's a fine point though; in most cases that spanking is well deserved.  :)
