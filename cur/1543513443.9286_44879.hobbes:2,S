The scan code has an option to disable the ACPI power activation.

That's unrelated to the ACPI issue. The ACPI problem usually happens when a
Windows driver leaves the card powered down, or even when Linux leaves a
card in W-O-L mode.  It's frequently the case that a device is updated with
ACPI, yet the PCI IDs and programming interface doesn't change.

I don't "sit on the code".  The process is far from opaque.  The updates are
describe on web pages, mailing lists and hypermail archives.  Yes, many
private test versions are sent to individuals and then have limited alpha
releases.  I do seek to minimize the number of "real" releases, so I don't
have to track a zillion released driver versions.
But I wonder why I put in the effort -- all of my work is thrown away when
you accept random, tested-only-on-one-machine patches from anywhere, and
then refuse to put in the tested, updated drivers.
