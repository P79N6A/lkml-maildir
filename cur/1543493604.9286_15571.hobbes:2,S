That sounds like the exact opposite of what was originally posted, of
being unable to remove a file when it is marked read-only.  Now you're
telling me that you have no trouble removing a read-only file.

I find that highly doubtful.
Anyway, I don't have any NT boxes to play with, but I do have Win98.  It
implements the behavior described in the original post, where read-only
files cannot be deleted until the read-only status is removed.  "rmdir"
and "rm -rf" do not remove anything.
