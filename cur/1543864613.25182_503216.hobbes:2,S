Hello Michal,
This cap_over driver is a capability driver to give certain processes
extra capabilities, this makes it possible to run them under a normal
user account. It is an inheritance from the time we used a
distribution that did not have support for SE-Linux.
You can find it at: 
http://www.randombit.net/projects/cap_over/
But, I do not think it is a nice solution, and I will replace it soon
by the default SELinux implementation of FC6.
Kind Regards,
Remy Bohmer
