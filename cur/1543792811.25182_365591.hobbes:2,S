IMHO git-prune-packed should prune redundant pack files...

:(  bummer.  I do like the elegance of having /usr/bin/git executing 
stuff out of /usr/libexec/git.
/usr/libexec/git also makes it IMO cleaner when integrating git plugins 
from third parties (rpm -Uvh git-newfeature), because you don't have to 
worry about the /usr/bin namespace.
