Hi,
Broadcom has a patch for 2.4.22, not 23 or 24. While trying to patch a vanilla
2.4.24 using the 22 patch, I get one hunk failure. I know this isn't a kernel
issue. Could someone (more influentianl than me) encourage Broadcom to release
up-to-date patches? Or, if someone has a patch that works with 2.4.24, would
you email it to me?
Here's the output from the 2.4.22 patch:
