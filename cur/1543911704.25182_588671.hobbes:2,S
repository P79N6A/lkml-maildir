unless there are some patches in the queue, the whole area of rounding
up and aligning is still sort of messy.
kernel.h defines the following:
...
#define ALIGN(x,a)              __ALIGN_MASK(x,(typeof(x))(a)-1)
#define __ALIGN_MASK(x,mask)    (((x)+(mask))&~(mask))
...
#define DIV_ROUND_UP(n,d) (((n) + (d) - 1) / (d))
#define roundup(x, y) ((((x) + ((y) - 1)) / (y)) * (y))
...
yet there is no corresponding DIV_ROUND_DOWN() or rounddown(), just
for the sake of consistency. (maybe there's simply no need?)
would someone like to propose a single, consistent standard for those
things?  or is it not worth it?
