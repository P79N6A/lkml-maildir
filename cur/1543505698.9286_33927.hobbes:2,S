Certainly it does, but then again it also needs to know whether to
pick readl() or readl_na() and a ton of other things.

I don't disagree that little endian should be the default method for
PCI access. What I was suggesting was an alternative function one can
optionally use if you know that you can do it in the other order.

This will solve the problem just fine, my arguing was basically that
the native or no-swap versions will avoid a bunch of ifdef's in
drivers, thats all. We can easily do things by defining
bigendian_writel() if you prefer it that way I just felt the other
solution was more elegant.

The thing I was more interested in is when you have multiple types of
adapters of some type with the same chips on them but attached to
different busses. For busses that are somewhat similar it would be a
nice solution around this but I agree it would be a hack.

Oh yes thats another issue, right now nobody agrees whether the
current writel is meant to be synchronous or not.
