OK - I was thinking of the CD problem.
So only allow these operations on the whole disk device?
If you wanted to grant them this capability on a partition then my 
understanding is that through the power of these operations you've 
essentially given them the ability to overwrite to the whole device 
anway - so just give them write permission to the whole device. MNaybe 
through setgid code though.
If you need some operations to act on the partitions then you'd have to 
differentiate between users writing to a partition and users operating 
on the partition. Difficult without better acls - so then you have to 
say "operations on the whole disk device granted through write 
permission; operations on the partition devices forbidden"
The less reasons to make users use or suid root, the better.
