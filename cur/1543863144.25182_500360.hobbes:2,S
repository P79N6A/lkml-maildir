I.e. I should start believing that OOM can not be prevented, bugs can
not be fixed and things can not be changed just because it happens right
now? That is why I'm not subscribed to lkml :)

When system starts swapping only when it can not allocate new page, 
then it is broken system. I bet you get warm closing way before you 
hands are frostbitten, and you do not have a liter of alcohol in the 
packet for such emergency. And to get warm closing you still need to 
go over cold street into the shop, but you will do it before weather
becomes arctic.

Of course swapping can require additional allocation, when it happens
over network it is quite obvious.
The main problem is the fact, that if system was put into the state,
when its life depends on the last possible allocation, then it is
broken.
There is a light connected to car's fuel tank which starts blinking, 
when amount of fuel is less then predefined level. Car just does not 
stop suddenly and starts to get fuel from reserve (well eventually it 
stops, but it says about problem long before it dies).

I can not accept the situation, when problem is not fixed, but instead
recovery path is added. There must be both ways of dealing with it -
emergency force majeur recovery and preventive steps.
What we are talking about (except pointing to obvious things and sending
to school-classes), at least how I see this, is ways of dealing with
possible OOM condition. If OOM has happend, then there must be recovery
path, but OOM must be prevented, and ways to do this were described too.
