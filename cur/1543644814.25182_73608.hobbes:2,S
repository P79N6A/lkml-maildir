   Are you saying combine the tables themselves? 
   
   One of the tradeoffs would be serialization of the access, then,
   right? i.e. Much less stuff could happen in parallel? Or am I 
   completely misunderstanding your proposal?
   
In fact the exact opposite, such a suggested flow cache is about
as parallel as you can make it.
Even if the per-cpu toplevel flow cache idea were not implemented and
we used the current top-level route lookup infrastructure, it is fully
parallelized since the toplevel hash table uses per-hashchain locks.
Please see net/ipv4/route.c:ip_route_input() and friends.
I don't understand why you think using the routing tables to their
full potential would imply serialization.  If you still believe this
you have to describe why in more detail.
