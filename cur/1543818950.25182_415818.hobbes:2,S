Subject: [patch 01/22] powerpc: iSeries needs slb_initialize to be called
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
Since the powerpc 64k pages patch went in, systems that have SLBs
(like Power4 iSeries) needed to have slb_initialize called to set up
some variables for the SLB miss handler.  This was not being called
on the boot processor on iSeries, so on single cpu iSeries machines,
we would get apparent memory curruption as soon as we entered user mode.
This patch fixes that by calling slb_initialize on the boot cpu if the
processor has an SLB.
