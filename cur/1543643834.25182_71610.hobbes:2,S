Subject: Hint benchmark reaches memory size limit on 4gb box

3.75 gb ram
4 gb swap on 2 disks
quad xeon
Running the FLOAT benchmark from
ftp://ftp.scl.ameslab.gov/pub/HINT/hint.src.tar.gz
2.5.34-mm1 gave:
This run was memory limited at 31438643 subintervals -> -1894198156 bytes
The last I noticed, the process was around 2.6 GB.
The process grows over time as it needs memory.
It may have hit 3GB.
The version of hint is from the tarball's
source/serial/unix directory.
The goal is to combine several benchmarks for
a more rounded workload.  
I could run 2 copies of Hint if this is a 3gb
userspace limit issue.
parts of the combined/concurrent benchmark:
1) hint (possibly FLOAT & LONGLONG together)
2) netperf -t TCP_RR	# request/response
3) chat	# 2 rooms with semi-long lived clients
4) postmark	# 2 directories + lots of files
5) configure && make && make check GNU ed
Any suggestions?
