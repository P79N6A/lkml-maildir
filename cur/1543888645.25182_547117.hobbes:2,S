i dont worry about it the least, i only replied to this sentence of 
yours:

which combines into this statement of yours: "I audited 1600 something 
lock points in the kernel to convert the usage of C99 style initializers 
something more regular, only to find out that there wasn't much left to 
convert over?", correct? Which begs the question: why did you mention 
this then at all? I usually reply to points made by others in the 
assumption that there's some meaning behind them ;-)
