Subject: CONFIG variables:  defined but unused

  at the moment, i'm running a quick-and-dirty script that identifies
Kconfig variables that are defined in a Kconfig file somewhere but
don't appear to be used.  this will take a while to run, but here's
the first few variables printed:
>>>>> 64BIT_CONTEXT
arch/mips/Kconfig:config 64BIT_CONTEXT
>>>>> ACPI_DEBUG_FUNC_TRACE
drivers/acpi/Kconfig:config ACPI_DEBUG_FUNC_TRACE
>>>>> ADB_KEYBOARD
arch/m68k/Kconfig:config ADB_KEYBOARD
drivers/macintosh/adbhid.c:#define ADB_KEYBOARD_UNKNOWN 0
drivers/macintosh/adbhid.c:#define ADB_KEYBOARD_ANSI    0x0100
drivers/macintosh/adbhid.c:#define ADB_KEYBOARD_ISO     0x0200
drivers/macintosh/adbhid.c:#define ADB_KEYBOARD_JIS     0x0300
drivers/macintosh/adbhid.c:     case ADB_KEYBOARD:
drivers/macintosh/adbhid.c:                     input_dev->id.version = ADB_KEYBOARD_UNKNOWN;
drivers/macintosh/adbhid.c:                     input_dev->id.version = ADB_KEYBOARD_ANSI;
drivers/macintosh/adbhid.c:                     input_dev->id.version = ADB_KEYBOARD_ISO;
drivers/macintosh/adbhid.c:                     input_dev->id.version = ADB_KEYBOARD_JIS;
drivers/macintosh/adbhid.c:     if (default_id == ADB_KEYBOARD) {
drivers/macintosh/adbhid.c:     adb_register(ADB_KEYBOARD, 0, &keyboard_ids, adbhid_keyboard_input);
include/linux/adb.h:#define ADB_KEYBOARD        2
>>>>> AEDSP16_MSS
sound/oss/Kconfig:config AEDSP16_MSS
sound/oss/aedsp16.c:#if defined(CONFIG_SOUND_AEDSP16_SBPRO) && defined(CONFIG_SOUND_AEDSP16_MSS)
>>>>> AEDSP16_SBPRO
sound/oss/Kconfig:config AEDSP16_SBPRO
sound/oss/aedsp16.c:#if defined(CONFIG_SOUND_AEDSP16_SBPRO) && defined(CONFIG_SOUND_AEDSP16_MSS)
>>>>> ALPHA_EV7
arch/alpha/Kconfig:config ALPHA_EV7
... etc etc ...
  just from the above, you can see the variety of results:
* both 64BIT_CONTEXT and ACPI_DEBUG_FUNC_TRACE are defined but are
apparently never referenced anywhere
* ADB_KEYBOARD is defined but apparently ignored in favour of some
hard-coded constants
* AEDSP16_MSS and AEDSP16_SBPRO appear to be typoes, but they're part
of OSS which is going away so who cares?
* ALPHA_EV7 appears to be unused
   ... and on and on, and i'm not even out of the A's yet.  i suspect
the script will finish by this evening sometime.
