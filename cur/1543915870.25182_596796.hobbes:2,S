The "Unused swap offset entry" is almost always a sign of bad memory,
if google can be trusted. Your workload is *extremely* CPU and memory
intensive (and even hits the disk!), so this looks like bad RAM, bad
cooling, or a marginal power supply that is failing under load.
memtest86+ doesn't stress the CPU nearly as much, so it often doesn't
show all the problems.
Take your RAM down to one stick and try again (looks like you have 2G
installed?). If that still fails, try different RAM. If that still
fails, then swap out the power supply for another if you can, and try
again.
