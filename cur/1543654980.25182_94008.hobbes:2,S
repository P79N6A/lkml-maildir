Hello,
I have a uml (user mode linux) instance with a debian/testing root
running on an Intel P200MMX with 96MB RAM. The host is running
2.4.20-fairsched-skas3 and the uml is 2.4.19-34um.
On boot when it loads my firewall, I get this:
Starting Firewall... /scripts/firewall: line 26:   109 Segmentation
fault      iptables -F
iptables v1.2.7a: can't initialize iptables table `filter': Memory
allocation problem
Perhaps iptables or your kernel needs to be upgraded.
The uml then locks solid. Anyone seen this before or have any ideas?

Thanks in Advance!
Ian
