The worker threads of the XFS work queues need not run after all of the other
tasks have been frozen.  In particular, they need not run after the suspend
image has been created, so making them freeze is reasonsble anyway.
[BTW, I'm going to do the same with all of the worker threads in the system
that need not run during the suspend.]
The question remains whether it's _sufficient_ to freeze these worker threads
and my opinion is that yes, it should be sufficient.

Now please tell me how this is possible?

Everything that was in memory before the suspend image has been created
will also be there right after the resume, because the only thing that can
access memory while the image is being created is the suspend thread.
I think the only problem that _may_ happen (without the patch) is this:
suspend				xfs
-------				----
suspend image start
suspend image finishes
thaw system devices
enable IRQs
thaw devices
				xfsbufd flushes delwri metadata
 				async I/O starts to complete
save image
Now, after a successful resume xfsbufd will attempt to flush the metadata
_once_ _again_, because it doesn't know of what has happend after
creating the image.
