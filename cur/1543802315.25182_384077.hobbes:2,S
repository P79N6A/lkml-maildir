Sounds like a broken configuration to me. Of course the usual array of 
hardware specs, configuration, filesystem, free RAM, etc. all play into this, 
but no KDE application, including the originally cited Kate, takes longer 
than 1s to start on this machine (1.6GHz P-M, 2MB L2, 400MHz FSB, 1GB 
PC2700).
Hell kfm is probably a hell of a lot more bloated than Nautilus and it's 
pretty fast to start first time (1-2s), and cached it's pretty much 
instantaneous (I'd say less than 400ms). Fast enough, no?
Sounds like the kernel is plenty fast.
