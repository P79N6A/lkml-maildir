Yes, but speaking as someone who had to use a large hammer to convert his 
driver from bus_to_virt et al.,  it does seem rather hard not to have the 
equivalent for the new pci_dma paradigm.  It does present an obstacle 
persuading people to convert drivers, particularly if the hardware is going to 
present a linked list of addresses (as SCSI hardware often does).
After all, whatever device maps between the io bus and the memory bus, it must 
always map a given dma_addr_t to a known physical address.  It can't be that 
hard to provide an an API in the kernel which can compute this relationship 
(although I can see it may be expensive to walk iommu page tables).  I'm only 
really asking for a dma_addr_t to virtual address by the way.  I see that 
mapping the other way would be problematic.
