What about block devices that could usefully use multi-path to achieve network 
redundancy, like nbd? If it's in the block layer or above, they can be made to 
work with minimal effort.
My basic point is that the utility of the feature transcends SCSI, so SCSI is 
too low a layer for it.
I wouldn't be too sure even of the IDE case: IDE has a habit of copying SCSI 
features when they become more main-stream (and thus cheaper).  It wouldn't 
suprise me to see multi-path as an adjunct to the IDE serial stuff.

That's true today, but may not be true in 2.6.  Suparna's bio splitting code 
is aimed precisely at this and other software RAID cases.

You can't really get away from this.  Transfer parameters are negotiated at 
the Scsi_Device level (i.e. per device path from HBA to controller), and LLDs 
accept I/O's for Scsi_Devices.  Whatever you do, you still need an entity that 
performs most of the same functions as the Scsi_Device, so you might as well 
keep Scsi_Device itself, since it works.

I really don't expect this to be true in 2.6.

The queues tend to be in the controllers, not in the RAID devices, thus for a 
dual path RAID device you usually have two caching controllers and thus twice 
the queue depth (I know this isn't always the case, but it certainly is enough 
of the time for me to argue that you should have the flexibility to queue per 
path).

SCSI got into a lot of trouble by going down the "kernel doesn't have X 
feature I need, so I'll just code it into the SCSI mid-layer instead", I'm 
loth to accept something into SCSI that I don't think belongs there in the 
long term.
Answer me this question:
- In the forseeable future does multi-path have uses other than SCSI?
I've got to say, I can't see a "no" to that one, so it fails the high level 
bar to getting into the scsi subsystem.  However, the kernel, as has been said 
before, isn't a theoretical excercise in design, so is there a good expediency 
argument (like "it will take one year to get all the features of the block 
layer to arrive and I have a customer now").  Also, to go in under expediency, 
the code must be readily removable against the day it can be redone correctly.

Patrick Mochel has an open task to come up with a solution to this.

The "scsi is everything" approach got its wings shot off at the kernel summit, 
and subsequently confirmed its death in a protracted wrangle on lkml (I can't 
remember the reference off the top of my head, but I'm sure others can).
