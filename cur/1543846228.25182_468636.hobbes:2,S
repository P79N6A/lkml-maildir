That will work for a day then they'll just change the spelling.  But
I've seen spammers using incorrect dates (presumably to appear at the
beginning or end of a mailbox) for years.
You could also flag a very short message that contains a URL and is not
a reply to an existing thread - I can't think of a legitimate post to
LKML fitting this pattern.
I would hate to see the list closed as that would amount to surrendering
to the spammers.
