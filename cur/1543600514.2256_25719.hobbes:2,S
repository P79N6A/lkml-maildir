Morale: Don't use soft mounts: they are prone to these things. If you
insist on using them, then try playing around with the `timeo' and
`retrans' mount variables.
Soft mount timeouts are not only due to network problems, but can
equally well be due to internal congestion. The rate at which the
network can transmit requests is usually (unless you are using
Gigabit) way below the rate at which your machine can generate them.
