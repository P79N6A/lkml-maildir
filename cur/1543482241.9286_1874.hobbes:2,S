Yes.  I have a swap partition on the secondary master, and the CD-ROM
is the secondary slave.
The drive in question is as follows:
hdd: Pioneer CD-ROM ATAPI Model DR-A14S 0104, ATAPI CDROM drive

/var/log is on the primary master, but nothing was logged.  At the
time of the crash, my system had not hit swap, so the secondary master 
had not been touched either.
