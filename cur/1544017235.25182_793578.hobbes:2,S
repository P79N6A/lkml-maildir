Actually, my patch is still just a hack, since pci_bus_type.p is still
set before the pci_bus_type is really usable. So if the kernel crashes
(or, in general, no_pci_devices() is called) at some point between the
pci_bus_type.p = <something> and pci_bus_type.p = NULL (which I
inserted), we will still see the same type of fault.
So I would prefer to solve this in a different way, like a dedicated
flag which is only set after we know that pci_bus_type initialisation
succeeded. I think that was the approach of my first patch? I don't
remember. In any case, such a patch could not be split in generic/pci
parts, I think. Also, should we anticipate concurrent access to
pci_bus_type.p or such a dedicated "no_pci_devices" flag?
Here is the first patch, but I wonder if it should be turned into
atomic_t instead:
