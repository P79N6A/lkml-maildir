Here (sparc64) I get build failures due to EXTRA_CFLAGS being set in
arch/sparc64/kernel/Makefile:
  EXTRA_CFLAGS := -Werror
But if I override this setting (broken, filesistems use clear_user(),
discard the result and have comments justifiying this) on the make run like
  make EXTRA_CFLAGS= all
the build fails in security/selinux/avc.c, since security/selinux/Makefile
adds:
  EXTRA_CFLAGS += -Isecurity/selinux/include
For now, I edited arch/sparc64/Makefile. There has to be some way to
control stuff like -Werror independently of other stuff (or perhaps the
SELinux Makefile got it wrong?).
