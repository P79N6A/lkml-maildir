Any updates to add_pin_to_irq are wrong.  It works fine.  If there
is something wrong we need to fix remove_pin_to_irq.
What is the problem you see?  Sorry I'm dense at the moment.
I preserve the invariant that irq_2_pin + irq is always the first
entry in the chain.  I do this when I delete a multi chain entry
by copying the next entry over the current entry, and then freeing
(and leaking) the second entry in the chain.
Is there something wrong with that?  I came within an inch of deleting
this multiple apic, pin to irq mapping code but the comments said it
is needed for some ioapic case.  So in resurrecting this variant I may
have goofed somewhere.
