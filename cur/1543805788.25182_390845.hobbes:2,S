This it the algorithm I've been following, but...

This doesn't seem to be true. Since when tracking this problem I added
the following:
    BUG_ON((host->cur_sg->length + host->cur_sg->offset) > PAGE_SIZE);
which subsequently triggered. That was the start of my quest for how to
do highmem properly.
