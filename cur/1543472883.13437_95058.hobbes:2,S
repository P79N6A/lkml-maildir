I also have to recommend the ethernet card route. Here in Raleigh, NC
(USA), you can get a basic 10BT network card for about US$18 at Stay
Online (www.stayonline.com, I don't know if they'll mailorder them or
not). With a crossover cable, you don't even need a hub. 10Mb/s is
about all you need for most home applications. For maybe US$50 you've
got a network. At those prices, *everyone* should have a network! ;)
