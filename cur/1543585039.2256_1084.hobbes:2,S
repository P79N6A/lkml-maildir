Nice.  Any chance of similar functionality finding its' way outside the
Tulip driver, eg. to 3c509 or via-rhine?  I'd find those useful, since one
or two of my Macs appear to be capable of generating pseudo-DoS levels of
traffic under certain circumstances which totally lock a 486 (for the
duration) and heavily load a P166 - even though said Macs "only" have
10baseT Ethernet.
OTOH, proper management of the circumstances under which this flooding
occurs (it's an interaction bug which occurs when the Linux machine ends up
with a zero-sized TCP receive window) would also be rather helpful.
