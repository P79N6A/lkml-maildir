Andrea,
I am very greatful for your detailed analysis. I have yet to digest
everything you commented but will get back to you on all points you raise
very soon. Here are my thoughts so far:

Kernel

otherwise

A fair point.
On point 3):

When I announced GKHI I did state that SMP support was to follow. The
updates are trivial but I didn't wan't to release the code until I had had
a chance to test it.
On point 4)

Are you claiming that flush_icache_range has an error and should implement
the IA32 instruction flush as I did using CPUID? If this is the case has
this error been officially reported?
On point 5)

Thanks for this information. Reserving a syscall will become irrelvant when
we release Dprobes as a module using gkhi since we will use ioctl() as the
application interface.

Well, not necessarily so while lkcd is not get accepted into the standard
kernel source. But also, even when lkcd becomes accepted, using gkhi with
lkcd will allow a crash dump capability to be actived dynamically. That
gives the user more fexibility. Even enterprise customers can sometimes
hedge their bets when it comes to RAS-like features.
