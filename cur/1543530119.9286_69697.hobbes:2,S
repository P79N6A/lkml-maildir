Hi,
I seem to have a problem with the latest development kernels. When I try to
check my / partition e2fsck says it cannot read/find the superblock. It
does, however, read from that disk or else init wouldn't even start.
This started in one of the late 40ies I cannot exactly tell which one, but
I'm sure it already happend in 47. 48 and 49 didn't compile for my setting.
Michael
P.S.: Please CC me on replies.
