OK, thanks.
Could you please go into /proc/<pif_of_kswapd>/cpu and double
check that each kswapd is only racking up points on the CPUs
which it is supposed to be running on?  As a little sanity check...
(hm.  Why isn't cpus_allowed displayed from in there?)
Also, we need to double check that I'm not completely full of
unmentionables, and that kswapd really is doing useful work there.
I can check that.
I'll do an mm4 in a mo (as soon as I work out who did the dud patch
which stops it booting) and we can see what the kwapd-versus-direct-reclaim
ratio looks like.
