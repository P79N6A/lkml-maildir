powerpc 64 bits nowadays does lazy HW masking, so local_irq_disable()
will not actually switch MSR_EE off. However, xmon needs that to happen
(though we have a nicer accessor to do it, I suspect some bitrot need
fixing in there, possibly already fixed in .21)
I agree that preempt_disable() should be put before the MSR tweaking
though.
