It only makes sense in addition to the kernel version number (which in
some cases can be meaningless), plus any distro and/or local patches,
plus the kernel config.
Without all that information you don't really know what you're talking
about, because any one of the many interfaces between the driver and the
core kernel may have changed.
So in practice I find it's much simpler to just get the exact source
that they're running, rather than trying to guess based on version
numbers. But that's just me :)
