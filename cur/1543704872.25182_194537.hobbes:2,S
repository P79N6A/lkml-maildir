Sorry, I should have looked further.  info->ngroups is an "int", so
if this check is needed, a check for negativity (or unsigned cast)
would also be needed.  But it shouldn't be needed in the copy to user
cases, and in the copy from user cases gidsetsize should be checked
much earlier, in or before groups_alloc.
