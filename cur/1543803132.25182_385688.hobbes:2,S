Hi all,
Shouldn't Neil Brown's patch be included in -stable too? It lets one use
software raid on top of a Promise SX8 SATA controller:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0601.1/1634.html
To my untrained eyes the patch seems simple enough, and it fixes a real
bug.
Please forgive me if this is not proper -stable material.
	Kind regards, Sander
