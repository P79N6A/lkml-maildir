Hi folks,
I'm just previewing the 2.2.5 patch. I noticed the
#define N_HDLC 13
in <asm/termios.h>
As my PPSkit patches also use "13", and Alan Cox once said he 
reserved the number for me (after having relocated it several times), 
I'm surprised how these numbers are assigned.
I don't like the idea of having to make just another patch only 
because of the number conflict.
FYI: Todays releases PPSkit-0.3.10 (Linux 2.0.36),
     PPSkit-0.6-pre7.diff.gz
Regards,
Ulrich Windl
