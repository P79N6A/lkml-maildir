I'm pretty sure the "unlikely()" part could be dropped with little/no
downside.  The part that's relatively expensive (10 cycles when
mispredicted) is the indirect call.  GCC doesn't handle this well on
ia64 and as a result, most indirect calls are mispredicted.
An alternative solution might be to have a call_likely() macro, where
you could predict the most likely target of an indirect call.  Perhaps
that could help other platforms as well.
