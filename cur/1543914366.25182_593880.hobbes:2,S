Partially implemented - my point 1 seems to have been addressed but not
point 2.  Point 2 is rather important, otherwise you can end up with a
port in stopped mode with no way to get it transmitting.
Also, it doesn't seem to be tweaking the DTR signal at all, so how does
it tell the remote end to stop transmitting?
Essentially, the author needs to search for CRTSCTS in serial_core.c and
*carefully* consider whether they need to modify those places as well.
I stress carefully, because at the moment we start the tty whenever
we move from CRTSCTS to no CRTSCTS.  If you're moving CRTSCTS->CDTRDSR
then you only want to do this iff DSR is asserted.
