Hey Jiri!
The symptoms remain after the patch (sleep key repeats endlessly, tv
key does nothing).  I'm going to post the debug output in a while, but
before I do, it might be relevant that there were a couple of typos in
the patch which I had to fix to compile ("intpu_event" function
doesn't exist; missing "{" on second if statement).  Also, I got these
warnings:
drivers/hid/hid-input.c: In function 'hidinput_hid_event':
drivers/hid/hid-input.c:1045: warning: suggest parentheses around
comparison in operand of &
drivers/hid/hid-input.c:1046: warning: suggest parentheses around
comparison in operand of &
drivers/hid/hid-input.c:1047: warning: suggest parentheses around
comparison in operand of &
drivers/hid/hid-input.c:1056: warning: suggest parentheses around
comparison in operand of &
drivers/hid/hid-input.c:1057: warning: suggest parentheses around

Could these be throwing the patch off?
Thanks,
Adolfo
