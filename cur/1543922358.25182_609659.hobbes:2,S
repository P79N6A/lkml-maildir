umm, spose so.
There's an excellent chance that a millionth of our monkeys will come
along and wreck this diff during the next two months.  In which case
I might end up dropping bits of it, we'll see.
It would be much better if this patch was a series of patches: one to add
the new infrastructure and one-per-subsystem to introduce users of the
infrastructure.  That way I wouldn't have to go mucking around in the
internals of the patch and remembering to tell you when I tossed bits of it
out, and which bits those were.
This shouldn't come as news to an old-timer :(
