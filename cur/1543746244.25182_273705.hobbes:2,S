Agreed that .tar.gz is a complicated format, but zlib is already in
the kernel. It _should_ simplify inflate and deflate of files. And as
compared to .gz format, .tar is much simpler, I guess.

I think, finite amount of memory is the concern of worry, not the rest
... if we could rely on zlib.

Doesn't zlib in the kernel gets updated as the formats change? If not,
.tar formats would be worth trying first as proof of concept.
