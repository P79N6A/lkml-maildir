Hi,
as my "normal" PC just died and I strongly need it as a router I thought
about adding this functionality to my alpha (digital AlphaStation 500
333 Mhz).
So I got a RealTek NIC from my i386 machine and put in into my alpha
hoping that would work (it would told me this should).
After installing the NIC the boot outputs
"
SLIP: version 0.8.4-NET3.019-NEWTTY (dynamic channels, max=256).                
CSLIP: code copyright 1989 Regents of the University of California.             
loop: loaded (max 8 devices)                                                    
Linux Tulip driver version 0.9.15-pre12 (Aug 9, 2002)

and does not do anything after that.
This was from 2.4.21-rc7, I tried 2.2.25 before and there was a similar
problem:

.. and halts too doing nothing...
Any advice? Do I need some boot parameters?
