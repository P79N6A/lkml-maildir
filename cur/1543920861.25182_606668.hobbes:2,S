I replied to Andrew, but I agree, it's worth a comment, I'll add one.

Yes.

One could argue that it's the caller that should do the mb() but that
would really be asking for trouble. Since most usage scenario require
it, and it's not a hot path, I prefer having it here.
Note that some kind of read barrier or compiler barrier should be needed
regardless, or we are just not sync'ing with anything at all (we may
have loaded the value ages ago and thus operate on a totally stale
value). I prefer a full barrier to also ensure all previous stores are
pushed out.

That isn't always the case. You can have very efficient lock-less fast
path and use synchronize_irq as a kind of RCU-like way to have the slow
path do the right thing.

Well, typically, I can clear a pointer and want to make sure my IRQ
handler isn't using it anymore before freeing the memory. Or set a "HW
is off" flag. Having spinlocks all over isn't always the best approach
on things that are really hot path, it's fair enough to use lockless
approaches like that by moving the burden to the slow path that does
synchronize_irq.
In general, I tend to think that for this function to make any sense
(that is, to synchronize anything at all), it needs a barrier or you are
just making a decision based on a totally random value of desc->status
since it can have been re-ordered, speculatively loaded, pre-fetched,
whatever'ed... :-).
Want a respin with a comment ?
