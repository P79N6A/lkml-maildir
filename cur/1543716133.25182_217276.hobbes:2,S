I'm looking at some sources for kernel Execute-in-place (XIP).
I see references to CONFIG_XIP_ROM and CONFIG_XIP_KERNEL,
in different architecture branches of the same kernel
source tree.
Is this difference merely the result of inconsistent
usage, or is there a functional difference between
these two options?
I can imagine that CONFIG_XIP_ROM is intended only to
handle XIP in ROM, and that CONFIG_XIP_KERNEL possibly
handles additional cases like XIP in flash.  However,
before jumping to that conclusion I thought I would
ask if there is some intention behind the different
config names.
Thanks,
