Subject: [patch 2/2] Check if the crashkernel area is behind BSS
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/15/132

This patch checks if the crashkernel base address is after the end of BSS
on i386 and x86_64.
Having "Kernel bss" in the resource tree is not sufficient since that only
prevents "crash kernel" from appearing in the resource tree and therefore kexec
from loading the crashdump kernel since it checks /proc/iomem. However, the
crashkernel memory would still be reserved.
