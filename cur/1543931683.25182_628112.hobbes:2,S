It is true that Michael can be a little unpleasant at times.
The colloquialism that comes to mind is that he "does not suffer fools
lightly".  Hopefully he will take your counseling to heart and learn
to be a bit more moderate in his tone.  FWIW, he is still young. :-)
That said, it is also true that the b43[legacy] driver[s] do a more
than adequate job of replacing the old bcm43xx driver provided that
one (re-)installs the proper firmware.  And I know of no other driver
that goes to more trouble to tell you how to get the proper firmware
installed than this one.
The bcm43xx driver will be added to the feature removal schedule
in 2.6.25.  Proper judgment will be used in deciding the actual date
of its removal.  In the meantime hopefully every distribution will
have or obtain a working udev configuration.  If things don't work
out as planned then we will re-evaluate.
Let's stop this now please.
John
