Fortunately (in this case) Gamma hasn't worked since about 1999. The SiS
DRM driver in XFree 4.4 snapshot is also exploitable although the 4.3
one seems ok. If you feed the memory allocator random crap it oopses.
With 4.3.x (ie the code in 2.4.x) it doesn't oops but requires sis_fb.
With 4.3.99... it oopses if I dont have sisfb.

It comes out as kmalloc, but its done so it will be portable to other
systems. So on *BSD it comes out appropriately too.
Incidentally the gamme code appears to have maths overflow problems in
the kmalloc paths too.
