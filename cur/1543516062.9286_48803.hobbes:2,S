Of course - only the sparc code actually uses it.
Some people will say that providing this item is a job
for libc, and I might agree some other day, but in this
case the standard continues and tells us to produce a coredump
for it (that is, treat it like SIGQUIT and the rest),
so that the kernel code also must test for equality with SIGSYS.
(And besides, apart from coredumps, giving the definition in
libc (i) is not done today, (ii) would be a very messy affair
since the signal numbers differ for the 9 architectures.
My patch is really the easiest way to get compliance on this point.)
