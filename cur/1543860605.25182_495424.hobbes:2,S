I strongly agree. Nowadays, both powerpc and sparc use an in-memory copy
of the tree (wether you use the flattened format during the trampoline
from OF runtime to the kernel or not is a different matter, we created
that for the sake of kexec and embedded devices with no real OF, but the
end result is the same, a kernel based tree structure).
There is already powerpc's /proc/device-tree and sparc's openpromfs, I'm
all about converging that to a single implementation (a filesystem is
fine) that uses the in-memory tree.
Ben.
