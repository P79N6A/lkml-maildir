Suppose I have a kmem_cache which at different times has different
sizes (like, for example, the cache used for 'stripe_head' in
md/raid5.c.  If I 'grow' and array, I resize that kmem_cache).
Suppose that the first time I create it, it has size X, and then
someone else creates a cache with size X.  The second cache will become
an alias for the first.  So when the first is destroyed, the name
says. 
Now I try to create another cache with the same name (it is serving
the same purpose) but with a different size.  It will need to create a
new cache, but the name is still in use.  Bang!
I really think you need to return a different handle to each
kmem_cache_create call so that you know which cache is being deleted
so you can mangle names correctly.
Another option might be to name each cache actually created with a
unique name, and then create a symlink for each cache that was asked
for (whether it was created or whether a pre-existing cache was used).
Then being lazy about deletion shouldn't be a problem.
