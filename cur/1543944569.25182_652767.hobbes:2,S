So we could do:
config foo
	tristate "do you want foo?"
	depends on USB && BAR
	module
	  obj-$(CONFIG_FOO) += foo.o
	  foo-y := file1.o file2.o
	help
	  foo will allow you to explode your PC
The [module] part would go unedited into a kbuild file
located in same dir as the Kconfig file and included by kbuild.
That would solve the Makefile issue.
And we could introduce support for
source "drivers/net/Kconfig.*"
But then we would have to make the kconfig step mandatory
for each build as we would otherwise not know if there
were added any Kconfig files.
Does this fit what you had in mind?
