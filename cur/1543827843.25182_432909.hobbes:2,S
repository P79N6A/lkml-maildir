I didn't have time to try this idea. However, the number of false
positives doesn't seem to be increased (or they are only reported
temporarily) if you don't scan the stacks at all (especially if you
scan the memory at a relatively quiet time). That's why I added a
config option for this.
The problem looks a bit more complicated for kernel threads as they
always use the kernel stack.
Another idea would be to only scan the stacks of the sleeping tasks
(and you could also get the frame pointer from the call to the
schedule function).
