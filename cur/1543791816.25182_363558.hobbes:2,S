It's not the same MB, but perhaps similar, I have a ga-k8ns. The 
Ethernet port works fine.  However; things did seem a little funky until 
I added ACPI support.  It seem that interrupts weren't being delivered 
as they should have been.
Symptom: sound would stutter REALLY bad, and the Ethernet module would 
load but never work.
