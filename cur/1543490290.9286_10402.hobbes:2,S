Could someone that understands the
differences between PIII and Xeon PIII
please outline the major *pragmatic*
differences...in otherwords, for example,
if you were buying a new computer for
Linux why would you choose a PIII vs a
Xeon PIII (what kinds of apps/services
would benefit from one versus another)? 
My particular problem is to find a cost
effective platform for a service that
lives behind/within a http server...it
must be as fast as it can...but price
plays in too 'cause on deployment there
may be alot of 'em. Advice?
Thanks in advance.
Russ
