Still not completely correct, though the targeted policy has an 
unconfined domain (unconfined_t) the policy still has allow rules for 
everything unconfined can do, 2 examples of things unconfined still 
can't do (because they aren't allowed by the targeted policy) is execmem 
and a while back when there was a /proc exploit that required setattr on 
/proc/self/environ; unconfined_t wasn't able to do that either (and 
therefore the exploit didn't work on a targeted system).
That said, the differentiation between strict and targeted is going away 
soon so that one can have some users be unconfined (but still with a few 
restrictions) and others can be fully restricted.
