I thought conventional wisdom was that header files should never #include
other headers, and .c files should explicitly #include all headers they
need.
Googling on "nested header" turns up several style guides that agree:
http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/resourcepages/indian-hill.html
http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/lab/secondyear/cstyle/node5.html
and others that say it is controversial, can be done either way:

Am I just off base in relation to kernel coding style? Or would getting
rid of header file nesting be a useful objective.
