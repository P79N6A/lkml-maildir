Well, that isn't what I asked about. We have another problem too.
ARM systems can have HZ be either 100 or 64, because some hardware
does not support 100. MIPS, Alpha, and ia64 all seem to support more
than one HZ value. According to you, binaries should not depend on
what platform they were compiled for. Asking the admin to supply HZ
is silly when the kernel damn well knows what it is. So there is no
sane way to even create this "/etc/sysconf" file you propose.

Fall back to the existing hacks as needed, then drop support
for 2.2.x after 3.0.x is out.

Not every sysconf value need come from the same place. Values should
come from the kernel if and only if they are determined by the kernel.
This is easy enough, perhaps 0xa000 to 0xafff are reserved for
kernel values, with other ranges for libc and other junk.

This is a maintenance horror for millions of clueless sysadmins.
Going with binary makes the horror worse, while going with text
will help slow down every Linux executable using glibc.
