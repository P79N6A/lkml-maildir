Subject: [PATCH 1/5] Convert resource to u64 from unsigned long
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Here's my first attempt of trying to convert the struct resource
start/end to u64 per blessed by Linus =) This is to support >32bit
physical address on 32bit archs such as some of the newer ARMv6 and
XSC3 based platforms and perhaps IA32 PAE.  I left the PCI stuff alone
functionally. Supporting 64bit PCI BAR on 32bit archs is for another
day. I fixed most of the core stuff I can think of, fixed ARM and i386
hopefully and a few of the device drivers as examples. I have tested
on an IQ31244 XScale IOP (ARM) platform and a dual-xeon platform for
i386. Matt Porter has graciously sent me PPC fixes that he tested on.
