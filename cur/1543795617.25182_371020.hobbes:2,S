It's not exactly simple, as it requires some kconfig hacking.
Something relatively simply would be to change the miniconfig.sh script 
into a C program, where it would have to access to all the information to 
do the job fast and correctly.
I think it can even be done in a single pass over all the symbols, where 
boolean/tristate symbols are checked if they are already at the minimum 
value and string/hex/int values are compared with their default values.
Next step could be to add a variation of allnoconfig with better error 
checking (e.g. checking that all requested symbols have been set), the 
basic allnoconfig functionality is just a few lines of code, the fun is 
in the extras.
To further reduce the config size one could look at the dependecies, e.g.:
config FOO
	depends on BAR && BAZ1 || BAZ2
In this case FOO could also set BAR, but not BAZ1/BAZ2.
But this also requires a new frontend to read such a minimized config 
file and is quite a bit more complex.
bye, Roman
