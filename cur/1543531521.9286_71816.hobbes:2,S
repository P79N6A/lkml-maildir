Okay, this is with the disk as hda and set to NONE in the BIOS and booting off
of my hdb.  So the capacity is correct in this case.

Again, that is all with the cylinder limits jumper OFF of the drive.

Okay.. EZ-Drive and whatnot is going to report 63*255*xxx, and so would most
BIOS, and probably Windows too, and on a dual boot system, that is the way to
go (and on a 40 GB drive, do I care about an extra 2 MB of waste).  Actually,
you could alternatively use sfdisk to extend past that cylinder anyway and
Linux would take it if it new the true LBA capacity.

I *THINK* that Linux (not the HD) is generating these IO errors because it
seems to think that the drive capacity is only 32 GB.  If I specify CHS on the
command line, will it use them or will it still override with LBA capacity???
The code looks like it will still override with LBA capacity, but maybe not.
I am gonna try it though tonight anyway.  If that will work then it can be an
interim solution.  Just use hda=4982,255,63 or something (I think.. have to
look that up again)..  If that works I'll post the identity data with the
limits jumper on and Linux at least able to realize the drive is bigger than
32 GB.

Well, I did unforunately run the JUMPON because I thought I needed it (I later
found out that I am not really sure since I put the jumper on the reserved
pins instead of cylinder limitations so that's probably why the BIOS still
locked up even though I thought I had cylinder limits sent).... Is there a
"JUMPOFF" utility to go with that???
IMHO, Linux should support a drive with the cylinder limits jumper set.
I suppose I could try calling Maxtor about it, if I hassle them long enough,
I might get a tech who can tell me what I need to do to make it work.
