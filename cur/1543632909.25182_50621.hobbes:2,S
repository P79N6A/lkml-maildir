Just create the file, and then put in the text.
/etc/modules.conf is for module options and aliases.
example: My sound card is a sb16, with irq=7 io=0x220, dma1=0, dma2=5
in /etc/modules.conf (this is from memory, might not be exact)
alias  eth0   3c59x
alias  sound  sb
options  sb  irq=7, io=0x220, dma=0, dma16=5
Now, I can do "modprobe sound"[0] and it will load my sb module with those
paramaters.  I could also do "modprobe sb" and it will load my sb module
with those parameters.  I can also do "modprobe eth0" and it will load my
3c59x module.
You may also put the aliased names in /etc/modules.
example:
eth0
sound
vfat
[0] modprobe is the preferred way to load modules, instead of insmod.
modprobe will load any dependencies your module needs, and will unload all
of them if one fails to load.
