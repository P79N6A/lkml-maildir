I figure we have three options:
1. ignore huge pages completely
2. teach the ->pte_entry handler that ptes can be different sizes,
   and pass the huge ptes into there
3. let the ->pmd_entry handler (or whatever level we've stuck the huge
   page entry in) handle it
4. create new handlers for large pages, like ->huge_pte_entry.  This
   works for now, but what would we do if we have multiple/variable
   large page sizes?
Any other thoughts?
