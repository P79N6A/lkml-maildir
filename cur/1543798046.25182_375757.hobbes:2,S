I just tried two 2.6.15-rc5-mm2 kernels; the first with only the
vgacon-fix-doublescan-mode.patch backed out and the second one with
only the vgacon-workaround-for-resize-bug-in-some-chipsets.patch one
backed out. Both kernels still had the problem, so I think we can
conclude that these two atches are innocent since reverting both of
them or just one or the other does not resolve the issue.
For what it's worth, I also just build a 2.6.15-rc5-git3 kernel and
that one works perfectly, so it's clearly something still left in -mm.
