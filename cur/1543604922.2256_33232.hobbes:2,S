As far as I recall, I have pre2 and it showed this error on compiling the sony
vaio stuff. I fixed it by adding an extern int declaration for
is_sony_vaio_laptop in sonypi.c. It was declared in some nonobvious .c file
far elsewhere, uh, ... arch/i386/kernel/dmi_scan.c.
There seemed to be a need for an acl.h somewhere too, but maybe that was my
xfs patch.
