I missed that, sorry.

I agree that with the current cpu selection arrangements it has to be
always enabled. I'm talking about Adrian's patch though.
I wasn't really arguing about it based on it causing a big slowdown. I
just don't agree with your opinion (which you're very entitled to) on
the matter.
I think that messing up your config options is a user error anyway. And
obviously a big reason for config options is so you don't have to
compile everything, are we really going to try catering for people who
make the wrong choices?
Aside, I think Adrian's patch makes cpu selection simpler for users, and
if it was combined with a warning for booting a non selected cpu I can't
see it being any more of a support problem.
