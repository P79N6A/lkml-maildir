Sorry, but this is far away from the worst case for your scheme. Actually it 
is a quite good case for your compiler, because every rule is fully specified 
(meaning there are no wildcards in any rule) and there are no ranges or masks 
involved. 
Try using a mixed rule set that contains rules that only specify certain 
dimensions and have wildcards on the other dimensions. Try using rules with 
ranges and masks.
Try using overlapping rules, meaning rules that completely or partly overlap 
other rules in certain dimensions.
This will make your data structure grow!

Yes, you are right. The HiPAC project has gone through some tough times over 
the last 2 years. With MARA Systems the HiPAC Project has finally found a 
strong partner that is fully committed to the concept of Open Source 
Software. This allows me to continue the development of HiPAC under the GNU 
GPL license.

Ok, I'll do that :)
