Why are you still trying to introduce yet another access control model 
into the kernel, when SELinux is already there?
Last I recall on this issue, we asked if you could look at providing 
integrity measurement as a distinct API, and integrity control as either 
integrated with SELinux or a distinct component which SELinux could use.
