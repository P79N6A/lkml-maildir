This is patch 2 of a 2-patch series.  The diff is against the
2.6.17-rc3-git17 snapshot.  It nukes some code that is dead after the
first patch.
* * *
do_timer_overflow is no longer used now; nuke it.
(By the way, the comment "It means that a timer tick interrupt came
along while the previous one was pending, thus a tick was missed" in
do_timer_overflow was wrong.  The code was meant to handle the easier
and more common case where the PIT counter wrapped just before we read
it and the tick interrupt that that caused was still pending.)
Note: There is some other code in the kernel that was meant to support
what do_timer_overflow was doing here.  See the "Subtle..." comments
in do_timer_interrupt and check_timer.  Unfortunately I don't know how
much of that code (if any) can be cleaned out now, as I don't
understand the stuff about "NMI lines for the watchdog if run on an
82489DX-based system" or all the details of check_timer.
