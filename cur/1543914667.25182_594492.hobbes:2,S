Subject: Interpretation of sparse warning

The code sequence
        u32 macstat;
.....
        macstat = le32_to_cpu(rxhdr->mac_status);
generates the following sparse warnings
drivers/net/wireless/b43legacy/xmit.c:446:12: warning: cast to restricted type
drivers/net/wireless/b43legacy/xmit.c:446:12: warning: cast from restricted type
(#446 is the macstat = ..... line)
My version of sparse is from the git tree and was downloaded today.
I think the code sequence is correct. What, if anything, should I do to eliminate the warning?
Thanks,
Larry
