Sparc64 does not allow smp_call_function() from software interrupts
either.
Same for powerpc, mips, alpha.
IA-64 has the inconsistency you've spotted between smp_call_function()
and smp_call_function_single().
In short, it's a mess :-)
I think it's logically simpler if we disallow smp_call_function*()
from any kind of asynchronous context.  But I'm sure your driver
has a true need for this for some reason.
