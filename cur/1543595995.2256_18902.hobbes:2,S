Agree.
But IMHO, you need to be more "visible" and to already propose those 
kernel modifications - even not the final ones - in lkml in order to let 
everyone see them and change the current think (even by Alan) that XFS 
is too intrusive for 2.4.
There are other people involved in the files you need to change and the 
more your patches are visibles, the more they are "credibles".
I didn't want to critisize XFS (or JFS and ext3) but to give some points 
about their integration in 2.4.
