With tracing disabled on the C3 (which is the NFS server, don't ask),
the maximum latency during the same kernel compile is about 2ms.  So
tracing overhead probably doubled or tripled the latencies.
I'll try again with tracing enabled to determine whether these code
paths are related to the NFS server or not.  It's either going to be
that or the get_swap_page stuff.  But the client side is OK now.
