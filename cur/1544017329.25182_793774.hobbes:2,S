Hmm, you're right.
Why not testing 1024 tasks, then check need_resched and if you sleep
and the task becomes unlinked (there are few chances) so... that's not
a big deal actually, you will have better chances on the next check :-)
I think that's a bit important since you are more likely to see a
soft-lockup if you have a lot of tasks.
