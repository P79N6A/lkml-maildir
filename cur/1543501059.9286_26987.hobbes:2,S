<P><FONT SIZE=2>I am having problems with our new Linux 2.2.10 ftp server box, call it "troubled.linux-box.com".&nbsp; This machine is used as an FTP server.&nbsp; Under Linux 2.0.36, we had no problems, but I recently setup a new machine with 2.2.10 to use instead.&nbsp; I have no problems connecting from almost every system I try (within our network or outside of it). However, when one of our customers attempts to ftp to the machine, netstat -r shows the connection hanging in SYN_RECV (shown below).&nbsp; It does this for about 30 seconds on the client's side before giving up (Connection timed out).&nbsp; On the server side, the connection disappears from netstat.&nbsp; I am at wits end.&nbsp; I have tried using other TCP/IP-based daemons on the server, such as telnetd, and all attempts to connect from this site also fail, in the same way.&nbsp; So, I am assuming that ftpd is not the source of the problem.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2>The only difference between this site that cannot connect and others that can is that they are attempting to connect from behind a firewall.&nbsp; (Before you guess that their firewall is misconfigured, keep in mind that I can switch back to the 2.0.36 machine at any time, and using the same IP address for the machine, connect without any problems at all).&nbsp; Because it DOES work under 2.0.36, I have temporarily switched our server back, but would really like to get back to using the 2.2.10 box.&nbsp; Can ANYONE explain to me what might be going on?&nbsp; The client says that they show NO traffic coming back from our server.&nbsp; My only guess is that this is a kernel bug or kernel misconfiguration, but I see no configuration options that apply to this.&nbsp; I am not using any firewalling/ipchaining/or TCP IP razzle-dazzle on this machine, just plain TCP Networking selected.&nbsp; Please help</FONT></P>
