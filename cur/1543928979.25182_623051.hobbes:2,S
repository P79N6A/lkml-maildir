Subject: [PATCH] Documentation/Changes -> Documentation/Requirements
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/30/191

Change Documentation/Changes to Documentation/Requirements, and at
least begin to separate the runtime requirements from the kernel
compilation requirements.
There are definitely kernel compilation requirements that are not
listed in this file.  It would be good to get them uncovered.
This document is obviously woefully incomplete, for one thing it has
absolutely no per-architecture information, except "may depend on the
CPU in your system."  Hopefully this will encourage people to document
those per-architecture requirements.

-Intro
-=====
-
-This document is designed to provide a list of the minimum levels of
-software necessary to run the 2.6 kernels, as well as provide brief
-instructions regarding any other "Gotchas" users may encounter when
-trying life on the Bleeding Edge.  If upgrading from a pre-2.4.x
-kernel, please consult the Changes file included with 2.4.x kernels for
-additional information; most of that information will not be repeated
-here.  Basically, this document assumes that your system is already
-functional and running at least 2.4.x kernels.
-
-This document is originally based on my "Changes" file for 2.0.x kernels
-and therefore owes credit to the same people as that file (Jared Mauch,
-Axel Boldt, Alessandro Sigala, and countless other users all over the
-'net).
-
-Current Minimal Requirements
-============================
-
-Upgrade to at *least* these software revisions before thinking you've
-encountered a bug!  If you're unsure what version you're currently
-running, the suggested command should tell you.
-
-Again, keep in mind that this list assumes you are already
-functionally running a Linux 2.4 kernel.  Also, not all tools are
-necessary on all systems; obviously, if you don't have any ISDN
-hardware, for example, you probably needn't concern yourself with
-isdn4k-utils.

-
-Kernel compilation
-==================
-
-GCC
----
-
-The gcc version requirements may vary depending on the type of CPU in your
-computer.
-
-Make
-----
-
-You will need Gnu make 3.79.1 or later to build the kernel.
-
-Binutils
---------
-
-Linux on IA-32 has recently switched from using as86 to using gas for
-assembling the 16-bit boot code, removing the need for as86 to compile
-your kernel.  This change does, however, mean that you need a recent
-release of binutils.
-
-System utilities
-================
-
-Architectural changes
----------------------
-
-DevFS has been obsoleted in favour of udev
-(
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/
)
-
-32-bit UID support is now in place.  Have fun!
-
-Linux documentation for functions is transitioning to inline
-documentation via specially-formatted comments near their
-definitions in the source.  These comments can be combined with the
-SGML templates in the Documentation/DocBook directory to make DocBook
-files, which can then be converted by DocBook stylesheets to PostScript,
-HTML, PDF files, and several other formats.  In order to convert from
-DocBook format to a format of your choice, you'll need to install Jade as
-well as the desired DocBook stylesheets.
-
-Util-linux
-----------
-
-New versions of util-linux provide *fdisk support for larger disks,
-support new options to mount, recognize more supported partition
-types, have a fdformat which works with 2.4 kernels, and similar goodies.
-You'll probably want to upgrade.
-
-Ksymoops
---------
-
-If the unthinkable happens and your kernel oopses, you may need the
-ksymoops tool to decode it, but in most cases you don't.
-In the 2.6 kernel it is generally preferred to build the kernel with
-CONFIG_KALLSYMS so that it produces readable dumps that can be used as-is
-(this also produces better output than ksymoops).
-If for some reason your kernel is not build with CONFIG_KALLSYMS and
-you have no way to rebuild and reproduce the Oops with that option, then
-you can still decode that Oops with ksymoops.
-
-Module-Init-Tools
------------------
-
-A new module loader is now in the kernel that requires module-init-tools
-to use.  It is backward compatible with the 2.4.x series kernels.
-
-Mkinitrd
---------
-
-These changes to the /lib/modules file tree layout also require that
-mkinitrd be upgraded.
-
-E2fsprogs
----------
-
-The latest version of e2fsprogs fixes several bugs in fsck and
-debugfs.  Obviously, it's a good idea to upgrade.
-
-JFSutils
---------
-
-The jfsutils package contains the utilities for the file system.
-The following utilities are available:
-o fsck.jfs - initiate replay of the transaction log, and check
-  and repair a JFS formatted partition.
-o mkfs.jfs - create a JFS formatted partition.
-o other file system utilities are also available in this package.
-
-Reiserfsprogs
--------------
-
-The reiserfsprogs package should be used for reiserfs-3.6.x
-(Linux kernels 2.4.x). It is a combined package and contains working
-versions of mkreiserfs, resize_reiserfs, debugreiserfs and
-reiserfsck. These utils work on both i386 and alpha platforms.
-
-Xfsprogs
---------
-
-The latest version of xfsprogs contains mkfs.xfs, xfs_db, and the
-xfs_repair utilities, among others, for the XFS filesystem.  It is
-architecture independent and any version from 2.0.0 onward should
-work correctly with this version of the XFS kernel code (2.6.0 or
-later is recommended, due to some significant improvements).
-
-PCMCIAutils
------------
-
-PCMCIAutils replaces pcmcia-cs (see below). It properly sets up
-PCMCIA sockets at system startup and loads the appropriate modules
-for 16-bit PCMCIA devices if the kernel is modularized and the hotplug
-subsystem is used.
-
-Pcmcia-cs
----------
-
-PCMCIA (PC Card) support is now partially implemented in the main
-kernel source. The "pcmciautils" package (see above) replaces pcmcia-cs
-for newest kernels.
-
-Quota-tools
------------
-
-Support for 32 bit uid's and gid's is required if you want to use
-the newer version 2 quota format.  Quota-tools version 3.07 and
-newer has this support.  Use the recommended version or newer
-from the table above.
-
-Intel IA32 microcode
---------------------
-
-A driver has been added to allow updating of Intel IA32 microcode,
-accessible as a normal (misc) character device.  If you are not using
-udev you may need to:
-
-mkdir /dev/cpu
-mknod /dev/cpu/microcode c 10 184
-chmod 0644 /dev/cpu/microcode
-
-as root before you can use this.  You'll probably also want to
-get the user-space microcode_ctl utility to use with this.
-
-Powertweak
-----------
-
-If you are running v0.1.17 or earlier, you should upgrade to
-version v0.99.0 or higher. Running old versions may cause problems
-with programs using shared memory.
-
-udev
-----
-udev is a userspace application for populating /dev dynamically with
-only entries for devices actually present.  udev replaces the basic
-functionality of devfs, while allowing persistent device naming for
-devices.
-
-FUSE
-----
-
-Needs libfuse 2.4.0 or later.  Absolute minimum is 2.3.0 but mount
-options 'direct_io' and 'kernel_cache' won't work.
-
-Networking
-==========
-
-General changes
----------------
-
-If you have advanced network configuration needs, you should probably
-consider using the network tools from ip-route2.
-
-Packet Filter / NAT
--------------------
-The packet filtering and NAT code uses the same tools like the previous 2.4.x
-kernel series (iptables).  It still includes backwards-compatibility modules
-for 2.2.x-style ipchains and 2.0.x-style ipfwadm.
-
-PPP
----
-
-The PPP driver has been restructured to support multilink and to
-enable it to operate over diverse media layers.  If you use PPP,
-upgrade pppd to at least 2.4.0.
-
-If you are not using udev, you must have the device file /dev/ppp
-which can be made by:
-
-mknod /dev/ppp c 108 0
-
-as root.
-
-Isdn4k-utils
-------------
-
-Due to changes in the length of the phone number field, isdn4k-utils
-needs to be recompiled or (preferably) upgraded.
-
-NFS-utils
----------
-
-In 2.4 and earlier kernels, the nfs server needed to know about any
-client that expected to be able to access files via NFS.  This
-information would be given to the kernel by "mountd" when the client
-mounted the filesystem, or by "exportfs" at system startup.  exportfs
-would take information about active clients from /var/lib/nfs/rmtab.
-
-This approach is quite fragile as it depends on rmtab being correct
-which is not always easy, particularly when trying to implement
-fail-over.  Even when the system is working well, rmtab suffers from
-getting lots of old entries that never get removed.
-
-With 2.6 we have the option of having the kernel tell mountd when it
-gets a request from an unknown host, and mountd can give appropriate
-export information to the kernel.  This removes the dependency on
-rmtab and means that the kernel only needs to know about currently
-active clients.
-
-To enable this new functionality, you need to:
-
-  mount -t nfsd nfsd /proc/fs/nfsd
-
-before running exportfs or mountd.  It is recommended that all NFS
-services be protected from the internet-at-large by a firewall where
-that is possible.

+o  Perl                   5.6.0(?)                # perl -v
+
+Not all tools may be required for all kernel configurations.
+
+
+GCC/Binutils
+------------
+
+The gcc or binutils version requirements may vary depending on the
+type of CPU in your computer.  (Need to add a list here...)
+
+
+System utilities
+================
+
+Architectural changes
+---------------------
+
+DevFS has been obsoleted in favour of udev
+(
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/
)
+
+32-bit UID support is now in place.  Have fun!

+
+Util-linux
+----------
+
+New versions of util-linux provide *fdisk support for larger disks,

+---------
+
+The latest version of e2fsprogs fixes several bugs in fsck and

+
+JFSutils
+--------
+
+The jfsutils package contains the utilities for the file system.
+The following utilities are available:
+o fsck.jfs - initiate replay of the transaction log, and check
+  and repair a JFS formatted partition.
+o mkfs.jfs - create a JFS formatted partition.
+o other file system utilities are also available in this package.
+
+Reiserfsprogs
+-------------
+
+The reiserfsprogs package should be used for reiserfs-3.6.x
+(Linux kernels 2.4.x). It is a combined package and contains working
+versions of mkreiserfs, resize_reiserfs, debugreiserfs and
+reiserfsck. These utils work on both i386 and alpha platforms.
+
+Xfsprogs
+--------
+
+The latest version of xfsprogs contains mkfs.xfs, xfs_db, and the
+xfs_repair utilities, among others, for the XFS filesystem.  It is
+architecture independent and any version from 2.0.0 onward should
+work correctly with this version of the XFS kernel code (2.6.0 or
+later is recommended, due to some significant improvements).
+
+PCMCIAutils
+-----------
+
+PCMCIAutils replaces pcmcia-cs (see below). It properly sets up
+PCMCIA sockets at system startup and loads the appropriate modules
+for 16-bit PCMCIA devices if the kernel is modularized and the hotplug
+subsystem is used.
+
+Pcmcia-cs
+---------
+
+PCMCIA (PC Card) support is now partially implemented in the main
+kernel source. The "pcmciautils" package (see above) replaces pcmcia-cs
+for newest kernels.
+
+Quota-tools
+-----------
+
+Support for 32 bit uid's and gid's is required if you want to use
+the newer version 2 quota format.  Quota-tools version 3.07 and
+newer has this support.  Use the recommended version or newer
+from the table above.
+
+Intel IA32 microcode
+--------------------
+
+A driver has been added to allow updating of Intel IA32 microcode,
+accessible as a normal (misc) character device.  If you are not using
+udev you may need to:
+
+mkdir /dev/cpu
+mknod /dev/cpu/microcode c 10 184
+chmod 0644 /dev/cpu/microcode
+
+as root before you can use this.  You'll probably also want to
+get the user-space microcode_ctl utility to use with this.
+
+Powertweak
+----------
+
+If you are running v0.1.17 or earlier, you should upgrade to
+version v0.99.0 or higher. Running old versions may cause problems
+with programs using shared memory.
+
+udev
+----
+udev is a userspace application for populating /dev dynamically with
+only entries for devices actually present.  udev replaces the basic
+functionality of devfs, while allowing persistent device naming for
+devices.
+
+FUSE
+----
+
+Needs libfuse 2.4.0 or later.  Absolute minimum is 2.3.0 but mount
+options 'direct_io' and 'kernel_cache' won't work.
+
+Networking
+==========
+
+General changes
+---------------
+
+If you have advanced network configuration needs, you should probably
+consider using the network tools from ip-route2.
+
+Packet Filter / NAT
+-------------------
+The packet filtering and NAT code uses the same tools like the previous 2.4.x
+kernel series (iptables).  It still includes backwards-compatibility modules
+for 2.2.x-style ipchains and 2.0.x-style ipfwadm.
+
+PPP
+---
+
+The PPP driver has been restructured to support multilink and to
+enable it to operate over diverse media layers.  If you use PPP,
+upgrade pppd to at least 2.4.0.
+
+If you are not using udev, you must have the device file /dev/ppp
+which can be made by:
+
+mknod /dev/ppp c 108 0
+
+as root.
+
+Isdn4k-utils
+------------
+
+Due to changes in the length of the phone number field, isdn4k-utils
+needs to be recompiled or (preferably) upgraded.
+
+NFS-utils
+---------
+
+In 2.4 and earlier kernels, the nfs server needed to know about any
+client that expected to be able to access files via NFS.  This
+information would be given to the kernel by "mountd" when the client
+mounted the filesystem, or by "exportfs" at system startup.  exportfs
+would take information about active clients from /var/lib/nfs/rmtab.
+
+This approach is quite fragile as it depends on rmtab being correct
+which is not always easy, particularly when trying to implement
+fail-over.  Even when the system is working well, rmtab suffers from
+getting lots of old entries that never get removed.
+
+With 2.6 we have the option of having the kernel tell mountd when it
+gets a request from an unknown host, and mountd can give appropriate
+export information to the kernel.  This removes the dependency on
+rmtab and means that the kernel only needs to know about currently
+active clients.
+
+To enable this new functionality, you need to:
+
+  mount -t nfsd nfsd /proc/fs/nfsd
+
+before running exportfs or mountd.  It is recommended that all NFS
+services be protected from the internet-at-large by a firewall where
+that is possible.
