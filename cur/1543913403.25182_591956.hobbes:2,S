Hi,
With recent kernels (2.6.22.x), we are experiencing that random null characters
are read by  our mySQL server (i.e. the number of bytes read by the server is
larger than the number of bytes written). I'm currently investigating the
problem (that occurs every 1-35 hours on a loaded system). A current suspect is
the following code in  net/unix/af_unix.c:
  static int unix_stream_recvmsg(struct kiocb *iocb, struct socket *sock,
                                 struct msghdr *msg, size_t size,
                                 int flags)
  {
    ...
    return copied ? : err;
  }
Shouldn't this read:
    return copied ? copied : err;
Or am I missing something?
Please CC me personally.
Regards
Anders Blomdell
