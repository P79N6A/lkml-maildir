My mistake. I run cat /proc/kpageflags in the first place - so how could anything change :)
cat /proc/kpagecount on the other hand - with the change in line 710 - locks the box.
Sysrq works, changing consoles works, but there is no "BUG: soft lockup ..." message.
After a while the box becomes totaly unresponsive - even caps lock doesn't work, no
responses to ping.
