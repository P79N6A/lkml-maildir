1. using kernel 2.6.7 on my dell inspiron 3800, i've noticed that the 
clock that assigns start times to processes is running behind, and i 
suspect it could have something to do with having suspended (s4) the 
machine:
john@density:~$ date
Fri Jul 16 07:42:29 EDT 2004
john@density:~$ ps u | grep ps
john      4194  0.0  0.2  2528  848 pts/11   R+   Jul15   0:00 ps u
john      4195  0.0  0.1  1576  460 pts/11   S+   Jul15   0:00 grep ps
2. swsusp will fail to get free enough space if laptop_mode is
enabled.  disabling laptop_mode (in /proc/sys) before s4
suspending allows it to work.  i was pretty sure it should have
worked, since i only have 384M ram and i saw 600M swap free.
3. when swsusp was broken, i found that s3 actually worked for
the most part.  my script switches from my x session on vt7 to
vt12, suspends, and when it resumes, i have it chvt back to 12.
this enabled the display again nicely.  if i try to switch to a
console login (vt1-6), they're completely black.  closing the
lcd lid and reopening it turns it back on, so it's _really_
close to functioning nicely.
