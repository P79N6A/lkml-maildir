I was using Red Hat 5.2 out of the box with kernel 2.0.36 .. 
I can display ASCII (Extended?) fine, like you know, color ANSI extended
characters.. I d/l'd 2.2.1 (And I just tried 2.2.2) and it is not
displayed correctly .. All wierd and stuff. If when it displays it wierd I
run BitchX - .. When I exit, the characters are displayed fine .. I am
using the codepage 427 and iso8859-1
Can someone please help?
