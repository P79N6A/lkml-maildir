It does indeed.  The patch I posted earlier today
(
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0402.2/0770.html
) fixes it.
I've got some more updates for this patch coming shortly, BTW.  If anyone
wants a quick workaround, you can just turn on Local APIC and the problem
will disappear.

the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
