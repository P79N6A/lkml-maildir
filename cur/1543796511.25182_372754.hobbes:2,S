"doesn't make any difference" I will interpret to mean there are no 
regressions.

PIO should work fine, modulo the obvious changes for ATA_FLAG_NOINTR 
disappearance.

There is nothing 3112-specific about this new code.

That's the preferred way to handle interrupts on this hardware.  Normal 
ATA is broken due to the lack of a way to ask "did I receive an 
interrupt?" without unduly affecting state.  311x, like AHCI, sata_sil24 
and other hardware, provides a method to easily determine if a PCI 
interrupt is owned by the hardware or not.
The code should eliminate all screaming interrupt problems, yes.
As an aside, 3114 should use a single 32-bit read of the Interrupt 
Summary register, rather than the four separate 8-bit reads that this 
code does.
