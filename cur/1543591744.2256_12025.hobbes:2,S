Having too many such modes would be a horrible mess, I agree.

Of course there are such cases. The criterion is that the code does not 
compile or if it did, it could never be expected to work - like SCSI drivers
without SCSI generic, or PCI devices without CONFIG_PCI.
This is the major criterion which has defined the dependencies already in 
the config files.
You want to add a new mode which hides some of the more esoteric options. 
That's fine. So do so, and then we have two modes. It's still not an 
unmaintainable mess. 
If having even two modes is going to be too troublesome, then keep the one
we have. You can try to simplify it later by encouraging individual
maintainers to hide stuff behind CONFIG_*_ADVANCED options. But keep that
strictly separate from the CML2 discussion.
