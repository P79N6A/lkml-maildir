I'll try Option "NoPM", and XFree86 4.0.2 if I can find a conveniently
RH7 compatible RPM.
I should point out that I've been using _some_ version of XFree86 4
since before version 4.0 was released.  (XFree86 3 doesn't support this
laptop's video adapter).  Suspend/resume worked fine and reliably until
recently.
Another problem is that occasionally when X starts now, it will freeze
the system.  So I suspect a bug was introduced in XFree86 4.0.1.
