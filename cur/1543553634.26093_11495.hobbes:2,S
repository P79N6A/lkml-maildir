Let me see if I understand this correct:
	Client	Router	Server
	------------------------------------
	Linux	Linux	HPUX		Bad
	WinNT	Linux	HPUX		Good
	HPUX	Linux	HPUX		Good
With all Linux boxes version 2.2.something
Is this correct?
This is slightly different from my situation; I had a Linux client and
Linux server directly connected to the same switch (3Com Superstack
II, FWIW)
I found the client always hung in my test; this was only visible at
the end of a SPEC run. Analysing tcpdump etc showed that in fact it
died somewhere early in the test, almost always before 10 minutes
worth of run.
In the end I 'fixed' the problem by using a HPUX server :-/ ... I
observe that there _are_ some SPECweb99 submissions with Linux (the
Tux result), I'm curious to know if the people who actually did the
test run experienced any problems...
Perhaps if I get time I'll repeat the experiment with (a) the most
recent Alan pre-2.2 kernel and (b) the most recent 2.4-test kernel...
I'll re-iterate my original request, which was not "it's broke - can
you fix it" but was "okay, how do I go about tracking this one down?"
cheers,
stephen
