Subject: [PATCH] 2.6.9-rc1-mm1: kexec ppc KEXEC Kconfig misplacement
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
The following patch places KEXEC Kconfig ppc option in
a more convenient menu, like in the i386 tree.
It seems that it got again misplaced (in the current
-mm tree it appears within the IBM 40x options menu).
Patch against 2.6.9-rc1-mm1, available here:
http://www.gc-linux.org/down/isobel/kexec/2.6.9-rc1-mm1/broken-out/kexec-kexecppc-kconfig-fix.patch
Cheers,
Albert
