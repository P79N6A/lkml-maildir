This kernel still suffers from the faulty OOM killing troubles of 
vanilla 2.6.9. Could you please pick up at least one of the recent fixes 
for this problem, such as as Rik van Riel's? As it stands -ac16 is 
unusable on a machine with as "little" as 64MB RAM, and bigger machines 
will just run into the same problems later.
  For example the following happens when trying to compile UML on a 64MB 
machine, whereas the same build completes without incident on 2.6.10-rc2-mm4
   LD      init/built-in.o
   LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
collect2: ld terminated with signal 9 [Killed]
make[2]: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/chris/src/umlsim-65/kernel/linux-2.6.9'
make[1]: *** [linux-2.6.9/vmlinux] Error 2
