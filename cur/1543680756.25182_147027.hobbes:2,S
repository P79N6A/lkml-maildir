Andries,
You mentioned:
 [util-linux is waiting for this; when 2.6 comes out, or the
  first mount/losetup comes out that uses struct loop_info64,
  whichever comes first, struct loop_info64 must be considered
  frozen: a stable kernel must not change API and user space
  ABI must remain constant. This means that if cryptoloop is
  added later, some backwards compatibility is lost.]
Is a newer losetup/mount needed to test the in-kernel crypto loop driver?
The crypto-loop code is present in the bk repository, now.
Thanks.
