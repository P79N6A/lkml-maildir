For SCSI devices probably, but I get "/dev/hde: No such device" (ENODEV)
when a CF card is inserted and recognized.
    (dmesg)
    hde: SanDisk SDCFB-32, ATA DISK drive
    ide2 at 0x100-0x107,0x10e on irq 3
    ide_cs: hde: Vcc = 3.3, Vpp = 0.0
When the CF card is not inserted I get a subtly different error
"/dev/hde: No such device or address" (ENXIO).
It looks like the drive <-> driver association is only set up when the
ide-disk driver module is loaded and not when new hardware is found.
