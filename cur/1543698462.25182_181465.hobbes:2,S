Given that hundreds of people have used it for several years, I find it
hard to believe that there are hidden bugs both so subtle that they
have not been seen and so bad that they cause major problems. I find "I
don't like the coding style" far easier to believe.
As you say, that's the way the system works, guess the patch will
continue, because it's more reliable than 2.6 at the moment.
