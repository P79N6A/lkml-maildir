Still an issue, probably minor.

no, that's bs.  The patch looks OK from that POV: try_to_release_page()
will be able to clear clean buffers from a dirty page.
And in fact if it did that, it will then clean the page for us (see
test_clear_page_dirty() in try_to_free_buffers()).
But we still need the clear_page_dirty() in invalidate_complete_page2() in
case we didn't call try_to_release_page() at all.

But this would be nice.
