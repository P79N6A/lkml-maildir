   so should i hold rtnl across add/remove atm addresses on atm dev's?
   (but iw ouldnt hold rtnl across people just reading the list of
   atm addresses right?)
Correct.
   i am planning (or have done) to move all the vcc's onto a global
   list (ala many of the other protocol stacks).  this makes the code
   for proc (and others) much cleaner since you just grab a read lock
   on the global vcc sklist instead of locking and interating each atm
   device.  further, this will let atm interrupt handlers block a race
   with vcc close/removal.  is this a bad plan?
Sounds good.
