This is an ethernet adapter.  It means that interference problems
should cause CRC32 errors, and the packets will be dropped/logged at
the MAC layer, and the TCP checksum not checked.  The MAC layer CRC32
is strong enough that TCP checksum errors should be exceedingly rare,
unless the interference is very bad and a very large number of packes
are being submitted.
Perhaps the error message is not really indicating TCP checksum errors?
