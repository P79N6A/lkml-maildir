the smart tools are *VERY* useful.  I recently built a raid box and
installed 5 of the disks in one nice fan-equipped bracket.  unfortunately,
100G WD 7200 RPM's vibrate fairly seriously, and this actually caused
horrible performance, as well as a small number of bad low-level writes 
and thus remapped sectors (shown by smartctl).  simply moving some of the
disks elsewhere entirely fixed the problem (120 MB/s!)
