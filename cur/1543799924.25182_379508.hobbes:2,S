I think the problem is actually a bug in the X server that we are
triggering indirectly. It's very difficult to fix things properly
because of various bugs that depends on each other side effects in X and
the DRM. I may have to back it all off for now and add some version test
to both DRM and X so that they only try to "do the right thing" once
they detect that the other hand has been fixed too... 
Let's see if the latest patch I posted that fixes things for you also
helps others though.
Ben.
