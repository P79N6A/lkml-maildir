Subject: [PATCH 00/14] Permit filesystem local caching [try #2]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/9/290

These patches add local caching for network filesystems such as NFS and AFS.
FS-Cache now runs fully asynchronously as required by Trond Myklebust for NFS.
--
Changes:
 (*) The CacheFiles module no longer accepts directory fds in its cull and
     inuse commands from cachefilesd.  Instead it uses the current working
     directory of the calling process as the basis for looking up the object.
     Corollary to this, fget_light() no longer needs to be exported.

A tarball of the patches is available at:
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/fscache/patches/nfs
+fscache-21.tar.bz2
To use this version of CacheFiles, the cachefilesd-0.9 is also required.  It
is available as an SRPM:
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/fscache/cachefilesd-0.9-1.fc7.src.rpm
Or as individual bits:
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/fscache/cachefilesd-0.9.tar.bz2
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/fscache/cachefilesd.fc
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/fscache/cachefilesd.if
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/fscache/cachefilesd.te
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/fscache/cachefilesd.spec
The .fc, .if and .te files are for manipulating SELinux.
