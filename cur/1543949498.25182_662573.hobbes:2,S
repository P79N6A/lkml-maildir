Right, Paul?

Yes indeed.  This fact doesn't seem to be documented anywhere, but it 
is clearly a requirement of the kernel.  I would make the text a little 
more explicit, see below.

Atomicity of reads of write for pointers and integral types (other than 
long long) should be documented.

+For all properly-aligned pointer and integral types other than long
+long, the kernel requires simple reads and writes to be atomic with
+respect to each other.  That is, if one CPU reads a pointer value at
+the same time as another CPU overwrites the pointer, it is guaranteed
+that the reader will obtain either the old or the new value of the
+pointer, never some mish-mash combination of the two.  Likewise, if
+one CPU writes a long value at the same time as another CPU does, it
+is guaranteed that one or the other of the values will end up stored
+in memory, not some mish-mash combination of bits.
+
+Thus, if all you need is atomicity of reading and writing then you can
+use plain old ints, longs, or pointers; you don't need to use
+atomic_t.  (But note: This guarantee emphatically does not apply to
+long long values or unaligned values!)

 The first operations to implement for atomic_t's are the initializers and
 plain reads.
