Thanks for your fast response!

What about other filesystems? Does anybody know anwser for Reiserfs3, 
Reiser4, JFS, XFS and any other popular server filesystems? I assume that 
if log file is some block device (like partition) both O_SYNC and fsync 
will work? What about ext2? What about some strange RAID/DM/NBD 
configurations? (I do not know in advance what our customers will use so I 
need portable method.)

I already saw them. But I am asking about current implementation status on 
Linux. For example does fsync differ from fdatasync if file is block 
device? Does O_SYNC always equal "write; fsync" for all not read only 
operations? Is it faster because only one syscall is executed?
Also flushing should be slow (for example 50 flushes/s) because disk seeks 
are slow. So if I need say 200 reliable writes to log per second may I put 
4 independent disks into the server and use them as 4 independent log 
files? But fsync operation blocks. Is there any "submit flush request and 
get some info when done" command or should I use 4 threads / processes?
Thanks in advance,
