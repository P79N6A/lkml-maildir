Lots of people use loopback in 2.2.x, where it works fine.

Nothing.
The additional information is whether the disk image uses the absolute
or the relative IVs. 
The bad part of the change is to make the relative IV the default, it needs
to be an optional feature for new filter modules that know what they are
doing (or that they don't need to worry about backwards compatibility) 
The way to do that is to add new function vectors to loop_func_table.
