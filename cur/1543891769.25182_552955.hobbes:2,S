Err... in laptops, almost *always* the KDC is emulated by the embedded
controller, so I bet you're right on the money, there.  It is not "a buggy
KDC", it is a buggy EC firmware and/or buggy SMBIOS which is a lot more
common.
And DoS'ing the EC is very high on the Don't Do That list on a laptop.  If
the X60 is only losing keypresses and producing no bigger fireworks, that's
outstanding behavior (as far as I trust ThinkPad firmware, anyway).
So please throttle anything that might access the KDC way too much (as
compared to normal keyboard operation by an user).
