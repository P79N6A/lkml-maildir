Hi Simon,
thanks, I queued the LED mapping fix for upstream.
I agree with Vojtech and Marcel that it doesn't make much sense having the 
hid-debug as a header file - I will fix it, and apply your patch to it 
(after I check why the debug output seems to be broken), you don't have to 
resend it, thanks.
