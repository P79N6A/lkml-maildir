On one hand I agree with you - OTOH: why not run an older version of the
kernel? Are kernel versions 2.2 or even 2.0 really not sufficient for such
a situation?  It should be noted that newer kernels are adding a whole lot
of drivers which aren't much use with old hardware anyway and only a
little actual non-driver related stuff (sure it's an oversimplification,
but...).  Just like you don't expect to run the latest
games/X/mozilla/kde/gnome on old hardware perhaps you shouldn't run the
latest kernel... perhaps you should...
Sure I would really like to be able to compile a 2.6 for my 
firewall (486DX33+40MB-2MB badram) - but is this the way to go?
As for making the kernel smaller - perhaps a solution would be to code all 
strings as error codes and return ERROR#42345 or something instead of the 
full messages - there seem to be quite a lot of them.  I don't mean to 
suggest this solution for all compilations but perhaps a switch to remove 
strings and replace them with ints and then a seperately generated file of 
errnum->string. I'd expect that between 10-15% of the uncompressed kernel 
is currently pure text.
Perhaps int->string conversion could be done by a loadable module or a 
userspace program?
Just my 3c and some ideas.
Of course part of the problem is that by designing the kernel for high mem 
situations we're using more memory hogging algorithms.  It's a simple 
matter of features vs mem footprint.
I'm not convinced either way - and I'm just posting this 
as a voice in this discussion...
Cheers,
MaZe.
