Yes and no. For execute in place to work proper, you need an
allignment of data to page boundaries "on disk" (or on flash)
just like you have when mmap()ing to userland.
Before choosing second extended, I also looked at some
flash/rom filesystems. But I was unable to identify one that
alligns the data proper (and does not compress things or
such). The ext family with block size == PAGE_SIZE does
fullfill that requirement once the "block device" starts on page
boundary.
On the other hand I believe that a filesystem specificaly
designed for flash can provide less metadata overhead then
second extended. Would also be interresting in our use-case
on s390.
