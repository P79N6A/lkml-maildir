I've repeated the above on the dual 933 Xeon:
Still problems with interactive behavior. Running KDE, with top running 
in xterm, scrolling through the menus I get some pauses. When the pauses 
occur I see kdeinit hit the top of the list and sometimes consuming 90% 
or more of a CPU and idle usage drops to 30-40%. I do see some latency 
traces (not really high ones) in the log that were generated by kdeinit 
but I think they were generated prior to when these pauses occurred, 
most likely when logging in.
Running amlat still hard locks the system. The last time this happened I 
got this in the log:

Working on booting the 450 right now.
