Hi all,
        Can any one know how the "timer_adj" calculation is working in 
timer.c of linuxkernle2.6.12.5
If we change the HZ value to more than 1000. What hapens to the wall 
clock. is there any modification neded in wall closk.
And  i have seen different "time_adj" calculations for HZ 100 and 1000. 
How to change this calculation for new HZ value.
Thanks,
Cjag
