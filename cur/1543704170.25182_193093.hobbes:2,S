It will.  I've had to work with a few drives or drive combos over
the years that would not spin up reliably.  It was vital to keep
them spinning once they were (all) up.  Adding this would make
reboot unnecessarily unuseable in such cases.  Perhaps just
flush, pause, flush would work as well?
Or even the logical equivilent to sync;sync;sync;reboot?
