To disable ac for a single directory for a certain amount of time, see
	
http://web.inter.nl.net/users/fvm/nfs-noac/2.4.20-noac-timeout.patch
	
http://web.inter.nl.net/users/fvm/nfs-noac/readme
:
This patch implements /proc/sys/net/nfs/noac-timeout
When a nonzero value is written, suspend atribute caching for the current
working directory and one level of files inside for the specified number
of seconds. Attribute caching will automatically be enabled when the time
elapses. Writing a zero re-enables attribute caching as well. Reading
yields the number of remaining seconds attribute caching will be disabled.
Maybe an NFS specific ioctl would be cleaner. But the above patch can be
used even from simple scripts.
