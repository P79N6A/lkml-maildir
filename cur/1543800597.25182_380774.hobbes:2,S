Dear Kernel groups, 
I have special requirement of gcc-3.3.3 i.e. FC2 default gcc over the FC4.
I am getting compile time errors when trying to build the gcc-3.3.3 over the FC4 dist. 
The procedure I followed and error messages I got below:
#./configure --enable-c99
# make bootstrap
....
....
....
./read-rtl.c: warning: traditional C rejects ISO C style function definitions
./read-rtl.c: 653: error: invalid lvalue in increment
make[1]: *** [read-rtl.o] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory '/root/gcc-3.3.3/gcc'
make[1]: *** [all-gcc] Error 2
Also, I am able to compile the gcc-3.3.3 over RedHat 9 whose gcc is 3.2.2. 
I tried to rpm install the gcc but it rejected saying that what I installing is older than the default existing one.
Do I need to pass additional arguments to configure script an well as make? please help resolving this issue.. 
Its almost 24 hrs I am bearing this.
Best Regards,
Mukund Jampala
