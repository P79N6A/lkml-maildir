The linux-kernel mailing list has about 10000 people, doesn't it?
Only two people disagreed with me over the RAM, along with a third that
disagreed over some other features. I'd say there is no big problem
having old 8 MB machines require a boot floppy.
The alternative (expect only 8 MB; use a 1.44 MB image) is bad for
all modern machines. There is something _wrong_ when Linus himself
has trouble installing Linux, don't you think?
