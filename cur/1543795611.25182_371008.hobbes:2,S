This is a big-tower (Chieftec DA-01BL-D

), 
the only bigger would be a very expensive server casing.

Yes I agree, though I counted all fans in the system (1 Northbridge, 1 
Power, 1 dual-power add-on board, 1 graphics, 1 CPU, 2 for the RAID array 
[generally only 7200RPM, but still quite hot] ;), 1 more in front for 
incomming cool air, 2 additional on the back for the outgoing hot air, 1 
orthogonal case fan above the CPU, and 1 big 120mm orthogonal above CPU, 
NB, and memory placed approximatelly in the center of the case. So it's 
actually even 12 total. Unfortunatelly it turns out, that the big one in 
the center is the most important one, as it's diverting the airflow, that 
otherwise goes front to back along the casing wall, to the CPU, as 
otherwise the CPU is burried and surrounded with the RAID array and some 
cables from the front side of the case, by a rather big graphics card from 
below (where the frontal additional fan is inserting the cool air), and by 
the casing stiffner from above. So pretty much the two orthogonal fans are 
the only ones reaching the CPU.
This really is an insane configuration, I agree. However though the alarm 
is beeping sometimes during a big load. The system is perfectly stable.

This is definitelly not the case here. I have most of the fans attached to 
a regulator, and if I turn the orthogonals off, the temperature of the CPU 
begins to rise very quickly.

Hmm, that may be the case for the dual system, as if the orthogonal fan is 
blowing at one of the CPUs the hot air from it may diverted horizontally 
along the MB to the other CPU and in fact heating it up again, or 
something. It shouldn't be the case for a UP.
