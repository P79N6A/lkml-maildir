It looks like more because of the changelog format.
The old changelogs were one-liners, and didn't mention small patches at
all (ie the entries like "Remove warning in /proc inode conversions" would
not even have made it into the changelog before).
Also, I used to combine entries from the same person, so the eight patches
for reiserfs would have been one entry ("reiserfs update"), and the 20
entries from Jeff would likewise have been just one entry ("update network
drivers").
That said, this week I've basically spent _only_ on making sure I work
well with BitKeeper (so far so good), so I have spent more time than I
normally do on merging. So yes, it's actually more merging too. That will
calm down eventually.
(The happy news is that I expected to be slowed down by BK for a while,
and that hasn't really happened. Some things take more effort now, but to
offset that some other stuff is _much_ easier, so..)
