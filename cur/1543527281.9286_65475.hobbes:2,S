Try them both.  /dev/zero may be faster eventually, once kiobufs do
clever things.  For the moment they should be about the same speed apart
from syscall entry cost, so zeroing a large region would be fine with
/dev/zero, and for a small region even when kiobufs are working, you
probably don't want the overhead of messing with page tables for a small
region.
