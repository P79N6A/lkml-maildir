Interesting. If this is reproducible for you, can you try to narrow down 
(with bit-bisect) roughly when it started.

It looks like it's a page fault as a result of a *user*space* access, and 
most likely your machine would continue happily, except you have 
"panic_on_oops" set, so when the oops happens, it shuts the system down.
Now, the reason I say it looks like a user space access is that you have
	RIP: 0033:[<0000000000510eea>]
	RSP: 002b:00007fffc9a8ec10
which are all user space segments. So the register contents clearly say 
"page fault in user space".
However, what makes the kernel oops (rather than just send a SIGSEGV) is 
that the page fault "error code" is zero (that's the number that is 
printed out just after the "Oops" string). For a normal user space access, 
you should have bit #2 set in the error code.
So the kernel thinks it's a kernel page fault, because the page fault 
error code says so. But everything else seems to indicate that it's really 
user mode.. It would be very interesting to hear when this started 
happening.
Even if you cannot bisect it down all the way, since you say that you do 
almost daily kernel testing, is this really new to 2.6.23-rc6-git2, and 
2.6.23-rc6-git1 was fine? 
Andi, anything comes to mind?
