[Problem with exported symbol]
Kai G. posted this receipt the other day:
------------
Well, you can do
cd my_module
echo "obj-m := my_module.o" > Makefile
vi my_module.c
make -C <path/to/kernel/src> SUBDIRS=$PWD modules
That's not too bad (and basically works for 2.4 as well)
------------
That should catch any compiletime problems. Just stick in:
echo "export-objs := my_module.o" >> Makefile
To mark it a module with exported symbols.
And for 2.4 you need to include Rules.make:
echo "include path/to/Rules.make"
HTH,
