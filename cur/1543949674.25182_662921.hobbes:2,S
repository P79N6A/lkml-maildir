While you're at it, could you add a field to indicate whether 
begin_sleep() has been called?  It would help prevent multiple calls to 
that method when a race does occur, and it could be useful for drivers 
as well.

One possibility is to unbind those drivers at the start of a sleep
transition and reprobe them at the end.  Another possibility is to
ignore the lack of PM support and hope it doesn't cause any problems.
