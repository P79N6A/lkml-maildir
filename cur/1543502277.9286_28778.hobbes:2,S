Hello,
    Is anyone else out there getting this?
[root@localhost linux]# /sbin/depmod -a
/lib/modules/2.3.10/fs/fat.o: unresolved symbol(s)
I'm running RedHat 6, which I think is using egcs 2.91.66(atleast thats
what gcc --version returns).
I was getting this problem in 2.3.9 as well, but not in 2.3.6.
Any suggestions would be appreciated.

P.S. Got my USB mouse going last night, nice job guys =).
