Subject: I/O errors in -test7-mm1 tree on ia64

I just compiled and booted -test7-mm1 on an Altix (I needed to create an
empty include/asm-ia64/kgdb.h to get tg3.c to compile), but I'm getting
the following errors after starting init:

I don't see this when using Linus' BK tree as of a few minutes ago, and
the only changes I've made are adding the kgdb.h for ia64 and adding in
the Altix console driver.  Any ideas?  I'll try reverting some patches
and looking around a bit more.
Thanks,
Jesse
