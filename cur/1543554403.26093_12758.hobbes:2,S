I was thinking segment descriptors.

Maniacal cackle....
x86-64 doesn't load the segment registers at all before use.
This is BAD BAD BAD!!!!!!!
I can tell you don't have real hardware.  The non obviousness
of correct operation tripped you up as well.
So while you load the gdt before you set a segment register later,
which is good the more important part was still missed.
O.k. on monday I'll dig up my patch and that clears this up.
