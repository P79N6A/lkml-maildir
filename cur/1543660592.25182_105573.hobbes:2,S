I'm seeing the same problem with a D-Link NIC (8139too driver). Exact same
symptoms - a delayed echo followed by no further echos. Checking netstat
shows an output queue for the socket but it never transmits anything.
Messages echoed by the remote server also make it through the connection.
The same problem does not occur using "telnet" to connect to the remote
host.
