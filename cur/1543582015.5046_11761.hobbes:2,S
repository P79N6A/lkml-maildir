oops, I *meant* static... doesn't gcc do mind reading?  ;)  (I had
static in the declaration, but forgot it on the definition.)

Hmm... well, if we're going for _those_ optimizations, shouldn't it be:
	return !(addr[0]&1) && memcmp(addr, "\000\000\000\000\000\000", 6);
so we do the cheaper test first and thus possibly avoid needing to do
the more expensive test? :)
Tell ya what, put that in <linux/etherdevice.h> (if that's the right
place) and then everyone can use it.  ;)  (I'd rather keep the longer
function name... "ea" isn't very helpful to the newer hackers among
us...)

:)  That's encouraging.  I still feel like I'm scaling the learning
curve, and I'm feeling rather "green".
Peter pointed out that the contents of the CSR12-14 registers are
initialized from the EEPROM, so reading the EEPROM is superfluous--we
should just read the CSRs and not read the EEPROM.  I think he has a
point, so I'll make that change and submit yet another patch pair.  
Alan, do you want me to put your inline version in <linux/etherdevice.h>
while I'm at it, or what?
Comments?
