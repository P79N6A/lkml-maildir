I do not think you can easily change it.
I can agree, making nfs_readpage() call an architecture dependent service
is not an easy stuff either. :-)

kmap_atomic() is used at several places. Do you want to set
PG_arch1, everywhere kmap_atomic() is called?

You can allocate (even in user mode) an anonymous page, hand-create or
read() in some code from a file, and mprotect(...., EXEC)-it. The page has
to become I-cache coherent.
I am not sure I can really understand your proposal.
I cannot see how the compatibility to the existing code is made sure.
Thanks,
