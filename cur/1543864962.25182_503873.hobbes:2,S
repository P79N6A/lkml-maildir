My position has always been that clocksources should be registered as
early as possible .. The fs_initcall() usage is a compromise stemming
from early resistance that John, and you gave to moving the clocks up in
the initcall sequence. the clocksource_initcall() exists only to allow
the clocks easily be raised if it was needed ..
I'm glad that you, John, and myself have come to a consensus on the
issue offline ..
