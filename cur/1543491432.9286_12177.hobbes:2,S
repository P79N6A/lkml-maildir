    Well, if you instist on making the additional requirement that anyone
    using GNU tools must add GNU/ to whatever they produce (I see that nowhere
    in the GPL, BTW, where did that requirement come from?) 
When talking about a Linux-based version of the GNU operating system,
it's only fair to use GNU in the name.  It's not a legal requirement;
unlike the BSD developers, I'm not trying to force you.  I'm asking
you to do it voluntarily.
    Perhaps
    you'd have better luck talking to the people who actually -make- the
    distributions, rather than a kernel hackers list?
Some distributions acknowledge that the system is GNU.  But when I
asked the makers of some commercial distributions to do this, they
said that they chose the name based on maximizing sales rather than on
what was right and proper.  One of them reprinted my article about the
issue, and said he basically agreed with it, but he still did not
change the name of the distribution ;-(.
I can't tell them what to do, I can only ask.
    We've already had evidence posted to this list that FSF-owned tools
    constitute less than 10% of the SuSE OS distribution.
The FSF-copyrighted programs are a portion of the GNU software, and
tools are also just a portion.  So what fraction of a particular
system consists of FSF-copyrighted tools has no special significance.
