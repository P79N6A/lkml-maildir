While your wm starting if your mouse is sluggish it is probably not a big 
problem, and it is part of something I'm already working on. The codeweavers 
problem is impressive though; I don't have codeweavers and have not seen 
anything like it. To get a full picture it would be helpful if you could run 
top as root say reniced to -13 just so it doesn't miss anything, and then 
start codeweavers, watch top and tell me what is spinning away hogging the 
cpu.
