I am running 2.4.9 on a PII with 448MB RAM. After listening a couple of
hours MP3 from the /dev/cdrom and KDE started, more than 70MB went to
swap, about 300 MB in cache and KDE takes about 15-20 seconds just for
logging out and showing the greeting console.
Obviously, all apps went to disk to leave space for caching mp3 files that
are read only once. Altough logging out is not a very often process...
