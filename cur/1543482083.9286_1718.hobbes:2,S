I'm running 2.2.0-pre9, and have been experiancing intermittant lockups
of my system.  The lockups are complete and the only way out is to hard
reboot the system.  I did not notice this ever happening when I ran
2.2.0-pre7 (I did not run pre8).
Attached is a copy of the relevent parts of my syslog.  It shows two
occurances.  The first time, I was running x11amp pulling mp3's off of 2
cdroms in the changer, and d/l a large file.  The second time I was just
starting to mount the cdrom changer and I think that I was connected to
the net.
I'm running on an AMD K6-2 300 w/ 128megs, Buslogic 946C with a 1gig
scsi drive(IBM- all /usr), Exabyte 8200 8mm Tape, and a Pioneer 604X
Cd-Changer on the scsi chain.  There also is a 1.3gig ide (~200meg / and
rest is /var), and a 16X atapi cdrom.
If you need more information, let me know.  I'd really like to know why
this is happening.
Thanks,
