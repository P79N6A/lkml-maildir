Unless I am missing something, notifiers have always been racy. 
No amount of locking you do in individual modules to prevent
races will help as the notifier chain is walked inside 
notifier_call_chain() in kernel/sys.c. One would need to
add some form of locking there (*) so that users of notifier
chains need not worry about races/locking at all.
(*) converting the notifier chain to an RCU-based list guarentees
to modules using the notifier chains that their handlers will
not be called once the handler is unregistered.
