My BP6's [hpt366] had similar sustained I/O lockup issues, especially
when running a RAID stripe.  From the v1.01 BP6 manual:
...
PCI slots 4 and 5 use the same bus master control signal.
PCI slot 3 shares IRQ signals with the HPT366 IDE controller
(Ultra ATA/66).  The driver for the HPT 366 IDE controller
supports IRQ sharing with other PCI devices. But if you
install a PCI card that doesn t allow IRQ sharing with other
devices into PCI slot 3, you may encounter some problems.
Furthermore, if your Operating System doesn t allow peripheral
devices to share IRQ signals with each other--Windows NT for
example, you can t install a PCI card into PCI slot 3.
...
Of course, I didn't read this until much later.
