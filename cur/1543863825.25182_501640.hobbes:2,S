I am now trying this, which so far seem to help (I had a printk in there
earlier and managed to trigger that).

This appeared to be (essentially) the key change in 2.6.18 related to
the check of tty->receive_room.
I will now run a bunch more tests to see if it manages to keep it from
having any more character losses.
Thank you for the suggestion of where to look.
