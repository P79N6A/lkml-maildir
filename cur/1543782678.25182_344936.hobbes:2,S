Oops! my bad.  I saw that needed locking, but I didn't have the tracing
on (I was trying for internal deadlocks), so that part of the code
wasn't compiling.  If you turn off tracing it would compile :-)
Anyway, the next time I modify code that's protected by ifdefs, I'll
change my config and see at least the code compiles.
Thanks,
