Nope, Nehalem uncore counters are separate per socket. The uncore
has its own counters.
You can program them to interrupt some fixed CPU thread (but 
it's not necessarily the thread who caused the event) or all CPU threads
on the socket.
I found these semantics quite hard to fit into oprofile too because
it also has too many per cpu events assumptions.

You can't (except by forcing only a single thread to run on 
the socket). The hardware doesn't know otherwise.
perfmon3 has a concept of counters which are system wide.
While that's also not a 100% match on a multi socket system
it's better than assigning it to some random CPU.

Hmm you want to create new virtual cpus for this?
