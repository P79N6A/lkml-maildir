Hi,
I've compiled linux-2.6.0-test1 kernel with the attached "config" file. When trying to boot the kernel, it hangs on "Uncompress Linux kernel...OK". The system is:
Intel 3.06Ghz Pentium IV
Intel D865PERL motherboard
ATI Radeon 7000 VE
I've tried with SMP and UP, but the kernel hangs anyway. The attached "config" contains the minimal set of drivers I can think of that could lead to a bootable system.
Curiously, Red Hat's 9 Stock kernel does boot perfectly with SMP and enables HT successfully. However, RH kernel doesn't seem to recognize the built-in SATA controller.
Any ideas?
Thanks!
