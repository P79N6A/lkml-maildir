I think what you want might be accomplished if the serial driver was
compiled as a module. Then have your driver grab all the PCI devices
it wants, and they shouldn't be grabbed by the serial driver when it
loads. If you can't get your driver to load before the serial driver
for whatever reason, unloading the serial driver should give up the
devices it had claimed.
