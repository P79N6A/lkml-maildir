Ah, yes.  That is quite brilliant, actually.

You are, of course, completely correct.  This patch historically was after cpupri, and this change is relevant in that case only.   Since cpupri doesnt have the nice property as yours where its limited to cpus_allowed, it helps to stop the search on that special case.  In the current alg, its just redundant .text and it should be removed.

I will make those changes and submit a new patch.
Thanks for setting me straight!
