   3. Does anybody know where to file a bug report on the Sega
      Dreamcast TCP?
Eventually it should reach Microsoft, since if I remember correctly
the dreamcast uses their networking stack.
Linux should not honor the incorrect sequence number.  If the sequence
number is incorrect, the RST could legitimately be for another
connection.  It is pretty clear in the tcp RFCs what is supposed to
happen here.
