Ok, understood; I tried this:
	t = raw_timer();
	ts.tv_nsec = 5000000;
	ts.tv_sec = 0;
	nanosleep(&ts, 0);
	t = raw_timer() - t;
It is better but I still see 8ms occasional delays when listing
nfs-mounted directories onto FB. And, what is funny, also this version
makes the average delay 20ms as if it made the jiffy 20ms.

Thanks a lot for a thorough explanation. While we are at it, is it then
the only option to use threads to wait for IO and use ms-accurate
timing? Formerly I have used select with timeouts for this task but
timing requirement have not been this accurate back then, of course.
