How long do you think it will take RedHat, Debian, etc. to make an IA64
native distribution?  I know Redhat doesn't have an UltraSparc native
version, and I don't think Debian does either (I could be wrong on that,
don't use Debian).  But, 32-bit binaries run on the sparc64 kernel. 
This is a similar case.
