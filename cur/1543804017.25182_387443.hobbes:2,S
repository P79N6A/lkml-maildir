Gee, it was 2.6.0-test9.  I don't remember, but I do recall the problems
were really really nasty, and what's the point?  We're only running one
thread on one CPU at that time, so none of these things _will_ sleep.

Don't care really, as long as a) the problems don't hit -mm or mainline and
b) someone else fixes them.  Yes, it'd be nice to fix these things, and we
might even find real bugs.  Perhaps things are better now, but I suspect
it's a can of worms.

Small cost, really...
