Hey, whatever works for you.

We already have that implemented in some tree somewhere, I think one of
the commercial branches.  It's not hard at all, but it's fairly slow
because it has to go pawing through the ChangeSet file.  Yeah, we could
add a cache but it seems rather pointless.
It is simply better to have the correct information recorded in the
correct place.  Saying that you can go dig it out of the ChangeSet file is
self defeating, that sucker is 40MB and digging anything out of it hurts.
So even if we gave you this feature in revtool, which is just
	bk sccslog -r`bk r2c -r$REV $FILE` $FILE
it's going to be too slow to be useful.
I dunno what to tell you other than I'm trying to guide you towards the 
use of the SCM that will be productive for you.  This would be true in
CVS as well, except it is worse unless you are using the bk2cvs tree
which maintains the backpointer to the changeset file there.
Why people persist in storing the less used information cheaply and the
commonly used information expensively is beyond me.  But hey, it's your
source base, knock yourself out.
