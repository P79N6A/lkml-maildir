hmm, yes.  The pin has to be held across ->prepare_write.  That
tears it.

OK.  That covers reads.  But we need to do something short-term to get
these large performance benefits, and I don't know how to properly fix
the write deadlock.  The choices here are:
- live with the current __get_user thing
- make filemap_nopage aware of the problem, via a new `struct page *'
  in task_struct (this would be very messy on the reader side).
- or?
(Of course, the write deadlock is a different and longstanding
problem, and I don't _have_ to fix it here, weasel, weasel)

glibc malloc currently returns well-aligned-address + 8.  If
it were taught to return well-aligned-address+0 then presumably a
lot of applications would automatically benefit from these
zero-copy reads.
