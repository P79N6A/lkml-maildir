I can confirm pre9 (aka final) running great on UDB (-> arch=alpha).  After
applying the SPARC patches and a on-line patch by DaveM it also works on SS10
(-> arch=sparc).
Linus, please consider including the necessary SPARC patches into the official
2.2.0.  Without the SPARC patches 2.2.0 is a no-go on SPARC (maybe SPARC64 as
well, but i am not sure about this).
Yours,
