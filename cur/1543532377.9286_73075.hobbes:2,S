While that could work, you'd need a pretty sophisticated mechanism for
determining the number of signal handler threads to use for the
job. It would also potentially conflict with someone at the user-level
deciding to block the signal. Finally, it would definitely be less
efficient, as you'd be first returning from sigwait() and then invoke
pthread_create(). The SIGEV_THREAD option allows the kernel to trap
the signal, create the thread, and then start executing the function
in question before transitioning out of kernel space. In theory at
least this can be quite fast. I'll see if I can find actual examples
with metrics.
Yes, this is pushing behavior into the kernel on one hand, but if
you're a thread fan, you could argue this is actually just the right
way to do signal handling in the first place.
One could minimize this overhead by using the "signal handler thread"
to execute the handler itself, but this would not give you the same
behavior (if I get 3 signals all at once, I expect to have 3 threads
running in parallel handling each of them).
