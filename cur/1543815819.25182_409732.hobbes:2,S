Agree that.  It should be done prior to kernel booting, invisible to the 
kernel itself.  I'm working on it, but there is still a lot to do.

Strongly disagree.  Without an ABI, you don't have binary 
compatibility.  Without binary compatibility, you have no way to inline 
any hypervisor code into the kernel.  And this is key for performance.  
The ROM code is being phased out.
Is it the strictness of the ABI that is the problem?  I don't like 
constraining the native register values any much either, but it was the 
expedient thing to do.  The ABI can be relaxed quite a bit, but it has 
to be there.
The idea of in-tree ROM code doesn't make sense.  The entire point of 
this layer of code is that it is modular, and specific to the 
hypervisor, not the kernel.  Once you lift the shroud and combine the 
two layers, you have lost all of the benefit that it was supposed to 
provide.
