It's a generel problem, you may get the queue run at any time regardless
of what the io scheduler is doing. CFQ does run the queue manully
sometimes, but SCSI may do the very same thing for you as well. Given
that SCSI also shortly reenables interrupts in the ->request_fn()
handling, it's quite possible for the request to be completed.
So, as we don't hold a reference to the request, I'd say your patch
looks correct and should be applied right away.

Yes certainly.
