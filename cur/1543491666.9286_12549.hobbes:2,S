To the best of my knowledge this doesn't exist.
And as some BIOS manufacturers are very prohibitive about their
technology, it's unlikely that a generic tool will ever happen.
You /may/ convince some vendors to port to Linux, but I can't see
that happening.
It'll be interesting to see how the OpenBIOS people get around this
problem.
