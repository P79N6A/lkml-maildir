Hi Nick,
Thank you very much for your comments. This is the first time of my
kernel hacking. I will reduce the lines of changes as much as
possible. As regard to the statistics, there are just count, ie, the
total number of priority-recalculations vs. the number of priority
changed from the former recalculation.
Thanks again,
-chen
