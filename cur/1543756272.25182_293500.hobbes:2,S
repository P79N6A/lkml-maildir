One of the arguments that I have heard is fairly old and debatable as
well.  This was the subject of a panel discussion at LWE in 2000 or
2001, chaired by journalist Nicholas Petreley.  The panel was composed
of vendors from (mostly) audio devices IIRC, but I'm not sure.
The bottom line summary was agreement that open-source drivers usually
expose how generation A of a device works, while the company is off
building generation B, and designing generation C.  So if another
company wants to clone generation A and be left in the dust when
their product is ready, let them.  They will usually lose.
