Subject: [PATCH] Fill more device IDS in the structure of m25p80 driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi all,
the structure:
struct flash_info __devinitdata m25p_data [] = {
/* REVISIT: fill in JEDEC ids, for parts that have them */
...
};
has a bunch of missing fields (like the JEDEC ids indicated) ... this
causes problems when actually trying to use some ST parts as it gets
detected incorrectly
The following is the patch.
