Hi,
Yesterday evening I put lots of debugging code in partition check and in
sd in hope to fix this bug but, sadly, when I rebooted this new 2.3.24
kernel - it just worked (and it was not my debug code that fixed it :)
So, the problem was - if you take out a ZIP disk from the SCSI ZIP drive
and boot you panic on partition check. Not any more.
Thanks,
