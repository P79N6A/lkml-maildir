yes it his right. he cares about the 'goodness' of the kernel. The
commercial and support issues he doesn't care about - that's the
domain of redhat/suse/compaq/etc../etc... and timpanogas (if you so
choose).
if you need debugger -> add it to your local tree/ship with a
debugger to your customers.

linux kernel hackers do the worrying about 'goodness'
but there is *nothing* that stops commerce adding tweaks to help with
support issues! (RedHat/SuSE/etc kernels are heavily patched and
tweaked!)
