One comment: iounmap() on result of ioremap(ISA address) is a no-op.
The problem in this case is that we are too early in setup sequence
and that confuses iounmap() into not recognizing that fact.  So we
end up trying to find VMA created by ioremap() and (surprise, surprise)
find none.  Which gives the warning in question.  We *still* do nothing,
so everything actually works fine, but we do get confused "WTF is going
on?" in the logs.
