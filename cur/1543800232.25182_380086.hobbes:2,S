OK, but precisely, we don't have any bug free version of gcc anyway. The
kernel has a long history of workaround for gcc bugs. So probably there
will be less work with a -possibly buggy- old gcc version than with a
constantly changing one. For instance, if we stick to 3.4 for 2 years,
we will of course encounter a lot of bugs. But they will be worked around
just like gcc-2.95 bugs have been, and we will be able to keep the same
compiler very long at virtually zero maintenance work.
A few years ago, I had to work on a mainframe system with gcc 1.37.
Yes, 1.37 !!! It was very limited, but I could adapt my code to it
without thinking about what would happen when they update it precisely
because it was not meant to evolve at all. It had been shipped like
this with the OS for 5 years and that was OK. With stable tools like
this, any bug becomes a feature because you don't risk someone fixing
it and breaking your workaround.
While it would be a real problem for user-space tools, I think it
is compatible with kernel needs. The kernel already has strict
requirements to be built and does not need the same level of
portability as pdksh or openssh for instance.
