Thta is the policy. Unless device claims to support certain events
they will not be passed through so there is no "surprises". This way
userspace applications can query device capabilities, classify them
and adjust behavior accordingly.

You probably want to use serio_raw module for that that provides raw
access to a PS/2 port (2.4-style) and possibly uinput driver to nject
parsed event stream back into kernel for standard delivery to
userspace apps.
