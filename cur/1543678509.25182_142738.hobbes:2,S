Ok guys,
Here's another set of PCMCIA patches to keep people occupied for a while.
Tested sa11xx and yenta here.  Please report successes/failures.
Note: if you are using modules, you will only be able to remove the
socket driver when the cards are ejected (by either physically removing
the card or via cardctl eject.)  Some init scripts may get upset with
this on shutdown; this will eventually be noted in davej's 2.6 changes
document.  The script needs to run cardctl eject before rmmoding the
pcmcia modules.

http://patches.arm.linux.org.uk/pcmcia/pcmcia-event-20030623-1.diff
	Move ->owner field from socket operations to pcmcia_socket.
	(This change is mainly for the SA11xx drivers, which use
	a core driver for the chip, and a separate module for all
	the machine specific bits.)
http://patches.arm.linux.org.uk/pcmcia/pcmcia-event-20030623-2.diff
	Get/Put module when we insert and remove a card.  This avoids
	a potential deadlock when socket drivers are unloaded, and we
	have a cardbus card known to the system.
http://patches.arm.linux.org.uk/pcmcia/pcmcia-event-20030623-3.diff
	Remove original module use accounting in register_callback.
http://patches.arm.linux.org.uk/pcmcia/pcmcia-event-20030623-4.diff
	Add work-around for i82365-based socket drivers to the core
	PCMCIA code.  Since insert processing is not a time critical
	event, we can afford to delay (by sleeping) these for everyone.
http://patches.arm.linux.org.uk/pcmcia/pcmcia-event-20030623-5.diff
	Remove register_callback methods; allow socket drivers to call
	pcmcia_parse_events() directly.
http://patches.arm.linux.org.uk/pcmcia/pcmcia-event-20030623-6.diff
	Remove now obsolete work queues, spinlocks, and code from
	socket drivers.
