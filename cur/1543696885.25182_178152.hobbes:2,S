Just wondering: the emails sent to the bk-commits mailing lists are just all
changesets in a `neutral' format that contains all meta information, right?
So if all individual mails were archived somewhere with correct sequence
numbers, they could be used to recreate the whole repository in whatever format
you want. I guess it's just a matter of importing them like patches into arch.

P.S. I did use the CVS gateway before to have a base tree to verify that the
     patches I send to Linus and Marcelo still apply cleanly. But these days
     full releases are so frequent that I can use these as base trees. And I
     monitor the bk-commits lists so I know what's happening in between.

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
