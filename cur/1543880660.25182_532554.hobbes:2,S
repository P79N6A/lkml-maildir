Just look at their code and their own description of AppArmor.  It does
not provide that level of control, and by your own metric, it is thus
not a halfway decent jail.  Which begs the question - if that is the
kind of approach you want, why not use a real jail/containers mechanism
for it?

I think he means the dependencies on which AppArmor relies, not just its
policy, e.g. since it is name-based, it presumes the filesystem
namespace has been set up by a trusted agent and is correct.
