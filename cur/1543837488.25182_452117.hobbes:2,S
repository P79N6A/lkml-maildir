Subject: [PATCH](memory hotplug) Repost remove useless message at boot time from 2.6.18-rc4.

Hello.
I would like to repost this patch to remove noisy useless message at boot
time from 2.6.18-rc4.
(I said "-mm doesn't shows this message in previous post", but it was wrong.
 This messages are shown by -mm too.)
-------------------------
This is to remove noisy useless message at boot time from 2.6.18-rc4.
The message is a ton of
"ACPI Exception (acpi_memory-0492): AE_ERROR, handle is no memory device"
In my emulation, number of memory devices are not so many (only 6),
but, this messages are displayed 114 times.
It is showed by acpi_memory_register_notify_handler() which
is called by acpi_walk_namespace().
acpi_walk_namespace() parses all of ACPI's namespace and 
execute acpi_memory_register_notify_handler(). So, it is called for
all of the device which is defined in namespace. If
the parsing device is not memory, acpi_memhotplug ignores it
due to "no match" and will parse next device.
This is normal route.
But this message says it is exception. It is meaningless.
I tested this patch for 2.6.18-rc4 on my box with hot-add emulation.
Please apply.
