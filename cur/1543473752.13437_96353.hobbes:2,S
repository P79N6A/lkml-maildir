Hi All,
Linux 2.2.0pre1 work well no problems found after 14 hours on a 
S1662D Dual PPro SMP System (BIOS TitanPro V3.03),
128Mb, BusLogic SCSI's disks, Comtrol
Rocket 16 Port comms, etc. No problems with 2.1.132 also.
Problem with 2.2.0pre2 patched, compiled and installs fine.
On booting get:
"Uncompressing Linux.....
Out of memory
-- System halted"
Clear cut enought I would guess.
Tried usual lilo append mem=127M etc, but problem still exists.
Rebooting 2.2.0pre1 (same config) everything is OK.
Cheers Grahame.
