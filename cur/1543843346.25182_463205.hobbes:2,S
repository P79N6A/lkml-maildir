Hi Dimitri,
I just took a quick look at your patch, and at least on the surface it
looks pretty nice to me.
One minor nit, why choose short for the affinity field in struct
timer_list, it seems a strange size to pick for something which is
either 0 or 1. Wouldn't int or char be better?  I don't know if all
CPUs have 16 bit stores, but they should have 8 and 32 bit.
The name 'aff' for affinity might not be good either, since we tend to
refer to affinity as a mask specifying where it's locked to, maybe
'locked' would be better?
All in the nit-picking department though.
Cheers,
Jes
