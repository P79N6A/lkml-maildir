I you have time, I would like you to try current BK with this patch:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/axboe/patches/v2.6/2.6.11-rc1/cfq-time-slices-20.gz
You should enable CONFIG_IOPRIO_WRITE, it is in the io scheduler config
section, if you do a make oldconfig it should pop up for you. Boot with
elevator=cfq to select cfq.
A simple profile of the bad period would also be nice, along with
vmstat 1 info from that period. If you boot with profile=2, do:
# readprofile -r
# run bad workload
# readprofile | sort -nr +2 > result_file
And send that along with the logged vmstat 1 from that same period.
Oh, and lastly, remember to CC people on lkml when you respond, thanks.
