they'll have to change anyway; delaying it one release doesn't actually
change that. And you can bet on most modules ignoring the warning anyway
and wait until the thing really is gone... making the value that this
extra delay has basically zero. While the cost is that more false users
will sneak into the kernel ;(
Maybe Fedora can ship with an #error here early on; an #error at least
can provide a helpful message on how to fix it.
