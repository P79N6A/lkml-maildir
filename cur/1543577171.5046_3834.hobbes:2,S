The file system metadata is, but it has no idea if the application's data is 
consistent or not.
Also when you listen to tytso's tales of certain cheap IDE disks writing crap 
when they and the system are powered off during a write you should probably
better not turn off the system running when not absolutely needed.
If the system was designed for situation (2) you would probably only
use applications that do their own log (or some other disk consistency
technique). That does not seem to be the case currently.
Also when unclean shutdown was very common you also be probably better 
of with a complete log structured fs that does not need to replay 
on mount.
