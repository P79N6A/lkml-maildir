vm_area_struct not having an ops member? There's no real need for ops on
uClinux since almost all of the ops are irrelevant. The only one that could be
relevant is vmops->close(). I suppose it might make sense to have this. It
would indicate to a chardev for instance that the last mapping upon it has
been gone, but then fops->release() is probably more appropriate still.
vmops can be added back in for the !MMU case if it's deemed appropriate.
