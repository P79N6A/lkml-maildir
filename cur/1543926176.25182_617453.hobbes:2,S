Mmm.. that's possible.  The NEC drive I have here works with either.
I wonder if an update to sr_select_speed() (inside the SCSI code) is needed?
It currently uses GPCMD_SET_SPEED, with no fallback to GPCMD_SET_STREAMING.
Or I suppose this is best left to userspace.
I may change hdparm to try both opcodes.
