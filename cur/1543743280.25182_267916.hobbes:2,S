The X server is not the parent.  The desktop manager (or whatever
those beasts are called) is more likely to be.

The X server manages a set of windows, arranged in a logical tree
structure, with all windows ultimately descending from the root
windows.  The parent-child relationships between windows should under
no circumstance be confused, or compared, with that between processes.
Any process, on any machine on the network, can, given enough
privileges, create subwindows of any window on the X server.  Windows
and process belong to different worlds, the only connection between
which is that processes create windows, simply since anything that
happens in the computer is done by a process (or interrupt handler).
