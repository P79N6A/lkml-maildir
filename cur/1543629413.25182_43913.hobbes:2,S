phase1 gathers timestamps to use for _all_ kbuild processing, not just
generating the global makefile.  NFS timestamp skew between edit and
build systems can make timestamps go backwards.  Edit a file, decide
you made a mistake, restore from a backup or a repository and the
timestamp goes backwards.
make does not detect timestamps going backwards, it is a common source
of build error, especially over NFS.  kbuild 2.5 detects _all_
timestamp changes, forwards and backwards, using the data gathered in
phase1.  phase1 must always run, you cannot optimize it away.

It is the database processing, see scripts/pp_makefile1.c.  Besides
gathering timestamps, there are 6 passes over the kbuild database in
phase1 to get the data ready for the rest of kbuild.
The comments on each phase are only summaries.  Every phase does more
than you think, please look at the code before assuming that you know
everything about the kbuild processing.

make NO_MAKEFILE_GEN=1.  Bypass everything and go straight to the
build.  No integrity checks of course.

I have not done any tuning on mdbm.  The source came from Larry McVoy
and I do not want to change it.

Code can always be improved.  At the moment kbuild 2.5 is stable and
ready to go into the kernel.  This is not the time to redo the
pre-processing programs or to try tuning the database code.  I am only
tracking kernel changes and doing bug fixes to kbuild 2.5 until it has
been accepted into the kernel.  Once it is in the kernel I have a list
of enhancements to be done, one change at a time.
