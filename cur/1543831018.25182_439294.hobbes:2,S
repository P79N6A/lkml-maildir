Looks sensible.
Please check that none of this is racy wrt memory hotplug
(process_zones->vm_stat_setup).

OK.  But let's not rush - it's only fine-tuning.  I'm thinking we should
get what we have in -mm4 into -rc1 - I think it's stable enough, and we
don't want to be carrying all those changes splatered across the VM for the
next two months.  Let's aim to get the well-measured fine-tuning in place
for -rc2, OK?
Are you aware of any to-do items remaining in the -mm4 patches?  The NFS
changes need a review from Trond - hopefully he'll be able to find 5-10
minutes to do that sometime?
