I haven't got a clue why and when that code got added. It is
absolutely positively wasted and is not required for kernel system
calls nor interrupts since they all must operate in kernel mode
and, therefore, use the kernel stack.

It's the kernel, of course. The scheduler runs in the kernel under
the kernel stack, with the kernel data. It has nothing to do with
the original user once the user sleeps. The user's context was
saved, the kernel was set up, and the kernel will schedule other
tasks until the sleep time or the sleep_on even is complete.
At that time, (or thereafter), the kernel will schedule
the previously sleeping task, its context will be restored, and
it continues execution.
The context of a task (see entry.S) is completely defined by
its registers, including the hidden part of the segments
(selectors) that define priviledge.

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
