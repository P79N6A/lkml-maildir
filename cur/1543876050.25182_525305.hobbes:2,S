Sorry, should have included it, I assumed a known issue:
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
ld: section .vsyscall_1 [0000000000533400 -> 000000000053342e] overlaps section .jiffies [0000000000533400 -> 0000000000533407]
ld: .tmp_vmlinux1: section .vsyscall_1 lma 0x533400 overlaps previous sections
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
Cheers,
Rusty.
