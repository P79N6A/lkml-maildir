It's not leaked... the new inode's mapping is saved in the buftarg:
 	btp->bt_mapping = mapping;
and then eventually the inode is put/freed in xfs_free_buftarg():
        iput(btp->bt_mapping->host);
The inode's mapping itself is used in several places:
  File                    Function              Line
0 xfs/linux-2.6/xfs_buf.h <global>                84 struct address_space *bt_mapping;
1 xfs/linux-2.6/xfs_buf.c _xfs_buf_lookup_pages  345 struct address_space *mapping = bp->b_target->bt_mapping;
