The Latest tar.gz in isdn4k-utils.src.rpm will not build.  I went to 
ftp.isdn4linux.de and found the latest they have posted and the following 
errors are reported from the build.
Against 2.4.0-10(11)     isdn4k-utils-v3.1pre1.tar.gz
ISDN_MODEM_ANZREG is undeclared in usr/src/linux/include/
Against 2.2.18-22        same
same problem
