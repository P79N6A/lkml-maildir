I wasn't actually suggesting we use the asciidoc tools--that's a
separate question.  We could ignore them, or wait till they solve
whatever problems they may have.
I was just suggesting that if we took your suggestion of standardizing
on plain text plus some conventions for formatting lists and headers and
such, one easy way to do that might just be to adopt the asciidoc format
(or some subset thereof).  Is there any part of the asciidoc *syntax*
that you object to?
