Well I guess it would fix the apicid_2_node build error but I can't
think of a single good reason to be in a config where you would need any
of the summit code in UP.  Perhaps a kconfig or makefile change in the
right spot would be better. 
Can you send along your config file so I can better understand?  I seem
to be able to build i386 UP just fine.  
Thanks,
