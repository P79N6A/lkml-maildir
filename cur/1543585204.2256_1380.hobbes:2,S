    Agreed. That would be a trivially easy bug in the firmware, limiting to
    255 sectors seems safer.

Yes, possibly.
I checked old standards, and see that "0 means 256 as a sector count"
is already in ATA-1.
Is there any evidence that other people have been hit by this?
Unfortunately, the
 "status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }"
is reported frequently these days, and has many causes.
In old reports it is rare. (E.g. none in lk for 1997.)
Paul: is there only one disk that you can make fail this way?
