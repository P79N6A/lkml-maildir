Indeed it will. However, Solaris' /usr/ccs/bin/make doesn't understand
the "-include" form:
make: Fatal error in reader: Makefile, line 5: Unexpected end of line seen
include without leading "-" is fine. BSD make doesn't understand either
form.
Jörg, how about Sam's suggestion? It seems compatible with smake.
