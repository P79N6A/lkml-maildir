Done, thanks.
Also, I tried to follow the code path from the userspace splice() call and
the kernel code. While splicing from socket to a pipe seems obvious till
tcp_splice_read(), I have a hard time finding the correct way from the pipe
to the socket.
It *seems* to me that we proceed like this, I'd like someone to confirm :
sys_splice()
  do_splice()
    do_splice_from()
      generic_splice_sendpage()      [ I assumed this from socket_file_ops ]
        splice_from_pipe(,,pipe_to_sendpage)
          __splice_from_pipe(,,pipe_to_sendpage)
            pipe_to_sendpage()
              tcp_sendpage()         [ I assumed this from inet_stream_ops ]
                do_tcp_sendpages()   (if NETIF_F_SG) or sock_no_sendpage()
I hope that I guessed it right because it does not appear obvious to me. It
will help me try to understand better the corruption problem.
Now for the read part, am I wrong tcp_splice_read() will return -EAGAIN
if the pipe is full ? It seems to me that this will be brought up by
splice_to_pipe(), via __tcp_splice_read, tcp_read_sock, tcp_splice_data_recv
and skb_splice_bits.
If so, this can cause serious trouble because if there is data available in
a socket, poll() will return POLLIN. Then we call splice(sock, pipe) but the
pipe is full, so we get -EAGAIN, which in turn makes the application think
that we need to poll again, and since no data has moved, we'll immediately
call splice() again. In my early experiments, I'm pretty sure I already came
across such a situation. Shouldn't we return -EBUSY or -ENOSPC in this case ?
I can work on patches if there is a consensus around those issues, and this
will also help me understand better the splice internals. I just don't want
to work in the wrong direction for nothing.
Thanks,
Willy
