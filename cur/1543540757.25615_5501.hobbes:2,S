I hate to reply to my own post, but I just got a chance to test this against
a stock 2.2.16 kernel, without the UIDE patches, and DMA works fine.  I get
good performance (10-11 megabytes/sec) and no timeouts of any sort.
So:
  * Old EIDE driver -- Works Fine
  * New EIDE driver (2.2.x+hedrick patch or 2.4.0testx) -- Fails with the
    above errors
Best,
