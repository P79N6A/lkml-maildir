I am not against the function of waiting for an initial scan, what I oppose is
using side effects to achieve that function. I do not want to take
responsibility for something that easily breaks because we use a kernel
subsystem for something it wasn't meant for.
That said, if there is a precedent for achieving this function a certain way, I
might be convinced to let it in. I'll have a look at that scsi example.

Yes and no. It depends on if it was an official function, or just an effect of
how things currently were implemented. As far as I can see, it's the latter. The
MMC layer goes through several steps that could very well get delayed or happen
in parallel. So the fact that it happened to work the way you wanted it to was
sheer luck.
