I've looked at different ways to do this and haven't seen a clean way
to do this. I made an initial stab at having tcp_recvmsg check
kthread_stop and break out of the loop if it sees it. Herbert Xu stated
that he didn't think that was right -- after all, why should
tcp_recvmsg care about khthreads?
As I see it we're left with using signals, or setting up some other
signal-type infrastructure that's just available in the kernel. That
seems redundant to me, and I'm not clear as to why use of signals by
kthreads is a bad thing.
So, here's a second attempt at this. This changes cifsd to ignore all
signals and changes the cifs mount/umount code to use force_sig()
instead of send_sig(). I don't think this is any worse than what we're
doing today and it insulates cifsd from signals sent from userspace.
This should apply to the current cifs-2.6 git tree.
Seem reasonable?
