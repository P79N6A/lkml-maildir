I happen to take a look at one of your docs and it was pretty good indeed.
You're underestimating the value of the documentation, that many
developers do not love to do. A university professor of mine once told me
that developers do not want to do documentation, not because they're lazy,
but because they do not want to show that what they did, at the very end,
is not that cool ;)
