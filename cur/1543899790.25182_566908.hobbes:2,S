Subject: [PATCH 000 of 20] knfsd: Support 'secinfo' exports with related cleanups
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

With this patchset it becomes possible to list a number of different
security flavours that maybe used to access an exported filesystem,
and to attach different export options (e.g. readonly, rootsquash) to
different flavours.
Also, NFSv4 can report which flavours are available on a particular export.
They are suitable for 2.6.23.
