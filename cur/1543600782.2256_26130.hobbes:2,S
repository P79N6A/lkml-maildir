The one Duron I have access to which doesn't like the athlon optimsed 
kernels did crash some seconds after starting a little test program which
does use the kernel copy code in user space.
Note that neither burnK7 nor burnMMX use the kernel copy code, but 
Robert Redelmeier (author of these two programs) has a burnMMX3 program
which uses kernel-equivalent code.
