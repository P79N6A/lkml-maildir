What's people tend to care about is average power usage over a period, not 
instantaneous power usage. In fact, throttling obviously doesn't decrease 
instantaneous power usage while the machine is doing anything (since it 
runs full speed and full power when running, and does nothing and uses 
some but not as much power when halted). Throttling decreases the average 
power usage over the period of the throttling, but increases the average 
power usage in general over longer periods.
If we throttle a car's velocity by only driving 100km/h for 5 minutes out 
of every 10 instead of all of the time, it doesn't meaningfully have less 
velocity. And it's a particularly meaningless measure if the arrangement 
as a whole is that it will leave point A at some time, drive to point B, 
and sit there until some other time; in this case its average velocity is 
the distance from point A to point B divided by the duration between the 
two times, regardless of how you drive. But the distance travelled is 
longer if you have to pull over and park every 10 minutes, and so the 
average velocity must be higher for the TDMA throttling case.
