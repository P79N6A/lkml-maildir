Your jffs2 question was already answered.
But this one wasn't answered:
> What about cramfs?
You can in fact use cramfs "on a ramdisk", e.g.:
cat image.cramfs > /dev/ram1
mkdir /mnt/cramfs
mount -oro /dev/ram1 /mnt/cramfs
mount | grep ram1
/dev/ram1 on /mnt/cramfs type cramfs (ro)
Of course cramfs also works on other block devices as well, e.g. mtdblock.
