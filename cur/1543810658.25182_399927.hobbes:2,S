Up until recently, this NIC was reported to work. I booted our
2.6.5-based SLES9 kernel on it. This is the kernel the machine has been
running for a while with the NIC working, and when I booted it, I got
the same DMA failure messages as with 2.6.16-rc4.
I suspect that the hardware has just recently failed, and I figured it
was a hardware problem when I saw the NMI/DMA messages, but since I
don't have physical access to the hardware, immediate removal wasn't an
option.
