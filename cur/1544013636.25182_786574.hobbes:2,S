Surely the thread should die again boot up? On module load
synchronisity is usually not a problem.
Personally I think it would be better to make this more generic.
Various subsystems have thread pool implementations now, and this
is just another variant that except for the sequence stuff
isn't all that much different. So it would be better to have 
a generic worker thread manager that just supports these
barriers too.
