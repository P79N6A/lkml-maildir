Hi,
I the 2.3.39 through pre-41 kernels have broken PCMCIA
support for my cardbus bridge (TI 1131).  I know Linus
has been working on the Yenta driver lately, but I've
not gotten any feedback on the problem in the last week.
Is anyone else working on this?  If so, is there any 
additional help I can provide with testing?
I am guessing that the Transmeta product announcement
may be impacting Linus world right now.
Many thanks!
	Miles
