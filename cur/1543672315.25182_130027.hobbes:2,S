It's OK as long as nobody uses the feature!  Once it starts to be commonly
used (say, in driver ->open() methods) then we'll get into the same problems
as with vmalloc exhaustion, vmalloc fragmentation, large physically-contig
allocations, etc.
Ho-hum.  Can the magical constant become a __setup thing?
