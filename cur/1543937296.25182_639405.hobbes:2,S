Subject: [patch 0/3] Remaining bits of WARN_ON series

Arjan posted a series of WARN_ON enhancements, parts of those were from
two previous patches from me.
Ingo picked up 3 of the 5 patches. Here are the rest-reposted again,
plus another patch bringing the generic report_bug() code up to the same
format as the x86-specific one.
These have to be applied on top of x86.git, since they depend on changes
in there. Ingo didn't want to take them directly since they touch code
in other architectures.
