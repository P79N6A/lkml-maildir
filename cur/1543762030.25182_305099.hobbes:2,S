Only super-user can bind netlink socket to multicast group.

I still do not see why it is needed.
Super-user can run ip command and turn network interface off
not waiting while apache or named exits or unbind.
In theory I can create some kind of userspace registration mechanism,
when userspace application reports it's pid to the connector, 
and then it sends data to the specified pids, but does not 
allow controlling from userspace.
But I really do not think it is a good idea to permit
non-priviledged userspace processes to know about deep
kernel internals through connector's messages.
