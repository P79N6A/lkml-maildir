Well this is the first real life example that explains why having
the pte marked readonly might actually make a difference in practice
(debugging a segfault when overwriting .rodata makes sense), so I like
it a lot better and infact I now for the first time can see why it can
help.
.text is not going to change on-disk, so the coherency loss for the
pagecache is not significant but losing the readonly protection would
prevent the segfault to trigger and so it makes debugging more fancy.
It certainly wasn't related to any PROT_NONE.
Thanks.
