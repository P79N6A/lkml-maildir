Here are 2 files, scsi-idle-225.patch.gz  --- and --- 
                  scsi-idle-2.1.62.tgz
The first patch file is against 2.2.5, and (in essence)
adds extra ioctls for scsi disk drive motor control.
I suspect that either 
a. kernel bloat, or,
b. disk drive start-stop stress
might be why it doesn't appear in mainstream kernels.
The second gzip tarball is the original archive from
metalab.unc.edu.  It contains the author's original LSM.
I think I tried to alter the daemons to get them to
compile under glibc-2.1.  I had some trouble there.
The original archive of patch kit and daemon were for
2.1.62 (remember wayyyy back then ;-)  and came from
metalab.
There is one caveat: the quantum Vikings I have in this
166 pentium are rated for only 30,000 start-stop cycles.
It would be well to keep that in mind when you use
this patch.  
I attempted to contact the author with a 2.2.5 update;
I haven't been able to contact him.
Anyway, it's been in use here for some time and
It Works For Me (TM)...  No regression or stress
tests.  If it breaks something, you own all the
pieces  ;-)
