I agree.  Take the case of Directcolor. At 16-bpp, it needs
linux_logo_vga16, not linux_logo_clut224. Also, monochrome at 8bpp needs
linux_logo_mono, certainly not linux_logo_clut224.  There are obviously
other similar cases.
I think the original logo code in both logo.c and fbmem.c, though a bit
more confusing, provides better ways of choosing the correct logo.
