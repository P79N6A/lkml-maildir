if that decreases code size then i guess we could do that.

yeah, i was just commenting on the general concept of 'naked' 
local_bh_disable(). And just to make it clear: with that i'm not 
implying anything about the quality of the networking code - networking 
is one of the cleanest [if not the cleanest] subsystems in the kernel. 
It's just that it's long term more useful for us if our "global scope" 
APIs have direct, programmatic relationship to the data structures / 
data flow they control. So i'd love to have the same flow/performance, 
just coded a bit more explicitly. [preempt_disable() for example has 
similar issues.]
