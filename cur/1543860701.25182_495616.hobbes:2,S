There is no deadlock on tty->buf.lock,
which is always acquired with spin_lock_irqsave()
and is only used by the tty buffering code.
The only deadlock I know of with the current tty buffering code
is calling tty_flip_buffer_push() with low_latency
set and from the ISR of a driver that has a problem
with the line discipline calling back into the driver.
The standard serial core has (or at least had the last time
I looked) this problem with the N_TTY ldisc:
driver gets internal spinlock in ISR
driver calls tty_flip_buffer_push with low_latency = 1
flush_to_ldisc() immediately passes data to line discipline
line discipline calls back into driver
driver tries again to get internal spinlock
With low_latency == 1, flush_to_ldisc() is deferred
until the ISR is complete and the internal spinlock is released.
I forget the exact driver callback that caused this.
