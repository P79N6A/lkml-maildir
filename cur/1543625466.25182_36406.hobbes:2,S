www.kdebug.com.  They are still setting up the website and docs.  I 
completed the debugger a few weeks ago.  I have been working on 
it for several months now.  If you want a copy to play 
with, I can send after I ask permission.  I do not own it and was
hired to write it as a work for hire, so it's not open source, it's
a commercial product for Linux.
