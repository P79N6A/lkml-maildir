aah! nice, those also fix the apt-get freeze I've been having from some
mm kernels ago.
I also managed to get the trace of apt-get freezing by means of Sysrq+P
but I stupidly forgot the fs was readonly so I didn't dump dmesg :P
I can easily reproduce it if anyone is interested.

don't know, I'd try the -2 patches also, they seem a different version
of the same fix/cleanup.
