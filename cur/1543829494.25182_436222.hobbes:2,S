This won't solve anything. What Martin probably meant is something like a poor
man's stop_machine_run() implemented by using smp_call_function(). This way
you synchronize all cpus and when all cpus are in a known state, you change
the instruction in question and make sure that serialization happens before
cpus leave the handler again... Except for the cpu that called
smp_call_function() you get the serialization for free, since the last
instruction of the handler is always an lpsw/lpswe instruction.
Otherwise there is still the possibility that a different cpu is fetching the
instruction concurrently while you change it. This doesn't sound very good,
especially if you take this paragraph of the Principles of Operation into
account (p.5-89 of SA22-7832-04):
"It is possible, if another CPU or a channel program concurrently modifies
the instruction, for one CPU to recognize the changes to some but not all bit
positions of an instruction."
