It turns out this is still not enough to fix the problem for me,
because ll_new_hw_segment is still allowing nr_phys_segments to become
too large. Is the following patch the correct way to deal with this
problem, or is that case supposed to be prevented by some other means?
At least, this patch prevents the kernel panic during my stress test.
