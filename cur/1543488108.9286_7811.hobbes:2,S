I had a EE professor years ago who noticed something sad about his students
when they were asked to determine the current in some circuit; they spent
roughly half the time coming up with the answer (some number of milliamps),
and then the remaining half of the time chasing down complex second-order
effects which at best changed the answer by a few microamps.  The professor
decided upon a new philosophy to help put things in perspective - greatly
needed by a student body taught what to think rather than how to think:
"Eight is roughly equal to ten for large values of eight."
We can apply this philosophy here, I think.  With some suitably (numerically)
large value of MAGIC, bumping any real offset left or right of MAGIC to avoid
MAGIC is trivial, if not somewhat ugly.
/* Caveat: I'm not a C programmer; I only play one on TV */
/* Replace this with whatever tickles your fancy. */
#define MAGIC    (1 << 30)
adjtime_wrapper(struct timeval *delta, struct timeval *olddelta) {
  if (delta.tv_usec == MAGIC) return_adjustment();
  else set_adjustment(delta, olddelta);              /* Or whatever */
}
userspace_read_adjtime() {
  struct timeval foo, bar;
  foo.tv_usec=MAGIC;
  adjtime_wrapper(&foo, &bar);
}
userspace_set_adjtime(unsigned long how_many_usecs) {
  struct timeval foo, bar;
  if (how_many_usecs == MAGIC) ++how_many_usecs;
  foo.tv_usec=how_many_usecs;
  adjtime_wrapper(&foo, &bar);
}
/* Blah Blah */
