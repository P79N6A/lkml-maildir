I have the same laptop, and it also crashes for me on resume when 
radeonfb is loaded.  However, it also crashes on a resume when radeonfb 
*isn't* loaded, so I hardly considered that a regression.  :)

...but it used to work?  Now that's interesting; this is the first 
report I've heard of a suspend-to-RAM (and subsequent resumes) working 
on that machine.

Can you send the *full* bootup log, including the command lines you 
used?
I noticed that you have the 'radeon' drm module loading too; that may be 
causing problems.  Are you running X when you try to suspend/resume?
Also, since you're using a Ferarri 4000, are you using the stock 3A23 
BIOS/DSDT, or are you using the patched DSDT from 
http://acpi.sf.net
?
