Hmmm, don't seem to have any other reiserfs mail from you.  Sorry I missed

We've had a half dozen or so reports so far of this, almost every time it
has been resolved as a compiler issue, usually an unpatched gcc 2.96.  One
user was using 2.95.3, but did not report back if switching to 2.95.2 or
egcs fixed the oops.
Anyway, which compiler did you use to compile the kernel?
