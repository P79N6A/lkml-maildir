Thanks - I wasn't aware it was always defined to be the gregorian calendar
in ISO9660. The orthodox calendar differs in computation (its more accurate)
and the two actually diverge in 2800. (Pan Orthodox congress 1923 if anyone
actually cares)

Unix file time is clean of those problems

Not a bad idea if there are enough file systems doing it.
