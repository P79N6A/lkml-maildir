Release 1.1.4 of JFS was made available today.
Drop 67 on October 30, 2003 includes fixes to the file system and
utilities.
Utilities changes
- Work around gcc 2.95 bug
- Handle log full without crashing
- Message format fix
File System changes
- Make sure journal buffer gets flushed to disk
- Improved error handling
- Remove racy, redundant call to block_flushpage
- Fix race between link() and unlink()
Note: The 2.4.23 and 2.6 kernel.org development kernels are kept up to 
date with the latest JFS code.  The file system updates available on 
the web site are only needed for maintaining earlier 2.4 kernels.
