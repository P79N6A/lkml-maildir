Hmm, perhaps you could clarify...
For boxes that rarely ever use swap with 2.2, will they now need more
swap space on 2.4 to perform well, or just boxes which don't have enough
RAM to handle everything nicely?
I've always been tending to make swap partitions smaller lately, as it
helps in the case where we have to wait for a runaway process to eat up
all of the swap space before it gets killed.  Making the swap size
smaller speeds up the time it takes for this to happen, albeit something
which isn't supposed to happen anyway.
