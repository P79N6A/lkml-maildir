Thanks for your kind response :-)
I've checked the regexp's in the TABOO list visually and couldn't 
find any obvious violation, certainly not on part of my URL's.
Maybe there's some other word in my text.
Is there an easy way for me to scan a sample message (as a local flat 
file on my system) using that reference TABOO list, in an automated 
way? Such as feed the TABOO list to a scripted instance of 
sed/awk/perl? I'm only moderately familiar with perl-compatible 
regexp syntax, some of the lines seem odd to me...
I'm reluctant to download Majordomo and look for some references in 
its documentation / source code, to look for the actual place where 
this TABOO list gets applied, to recover a stand-alone usage 
example...
Any ideas are welcome :-)
