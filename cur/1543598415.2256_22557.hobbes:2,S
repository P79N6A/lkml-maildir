Well, duh.  Let me explain.
>From mm/vmscan.c::kswapd() a short comment I wrote while
implementing part of the current VM:
                /*
                 * We go to sleep if either the free page shortage
                 * or the inactive page shortage is gone. We do this
                 * because:
                 * 1) we need no more free pages   or
                 * 2) the inactive pages need to be flushed to disk,
                 *    it wouldn't help to eat CPU time now ...
                 *
                 * We go to sleep for one second, but if it's needed
                 * we'll be woken up earlier...
                 */
                if (!free_shortage() || !inactive_shortage()) {
                        interruptible_sleep_on_timeout(&kswapd_wait, HZ);
I wonder when Linus lost his ability to read comments ;)
