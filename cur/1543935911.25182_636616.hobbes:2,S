sparse wouldn't have helped it in the current state.  The thing is, it
doesn't understand printf-style formats.  We probably ought to implement
that - would have a benefit of being able to get rid of gcc stupidity
in that area and actually define conversion specifiers of our own for
things like u64, dma_addr_t, etc. without having gcc scream at us...
