you are really using the wrong technology for this.
look at the latency tracing patch i posted today: it includes a feature 
that prints the worst-case stack footprint _as it happens_, and thus 
allows the mapping of such effects in a very efficient and very 
practical way. As it works on a live system, and profiles live function 
traces, it goes through function pointers and irq entry nesting effects 
too. We could perhaps put that into Fedora for a while and get the 
worst-case footprints mapped.
in fact i've been running this feature in the -rt kernel for quite some 
time, and it enabled the fixing of a couple of bad stack abusers, and it 
also told us what our current worst-case stack footprint is [when 4K 
stacks are enabled]: it's execve of an ELF binary.
