Every 1394 device is required to have a Config ROM directory. The
directory has to be _atleast_ 4 quads for basic information to be
extracted and allow the subsystem to use the device. Without even 1 quad
it cannot even verify the magic '1', '3', '9', '4' quad at the start of
it.
If one cdrom works in the enclosure and another doesn't, then I suspect
something is weird with the enclosure's detection of the device you
placed in it. Are you sure that the master/slave jumpers are set
correctly for the enclosure? Anything else it needs?
