And that's already bad enough.  Most of the "files" in proc should
be fifos!  And using proc as an excuse to introduce another set of
magic dirs?  No, thanks.

IMHO it would be better to fix proc instead of adding more magic.  At
the moment you have to exclude /proc.  You want to add /dev.  And next?
Exclude all $HOME/dev (in case process name spaces get added)?  Or make
fifos magic too and add all of them to the exclude list?  But there's
no central place for fifos.  So lets add more magic :-(

As already said: depending on O_DIRECTORY breaks POSIX compliance
and that alone should kill this idea...
Over and out, ET.
