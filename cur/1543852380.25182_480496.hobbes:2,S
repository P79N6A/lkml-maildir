'distance' is associated with a link, and is meant to represent the number 
of intervening locks. So a distance of 1 b/w say lock a and b is to say 
there is no intervening lock, whereas 2 would mean there is 1 
intervening lock etc.
The reason i added this was that in my algorithm to order locks, say i 
come to lock a, which has lock b and lock c in its 'after' list. I don't 
know at that point if lock b needs to come before c, or maybe that c has 
to come before b.
You are right though, i think that the data in the locks after lists is 
sufficient to re-create the entire graph, since its acyclic, but by simply 
printing out nodes of distance '1', the algorithm is greatly simplified. 
Otherwise, i'd have to first reconstruct the graph...
Also, i was only looking for a link to be label as distance 1, or not...so 
we only need to associate 1 bit of information with each link, if you are 
concerned about struture bloat.
