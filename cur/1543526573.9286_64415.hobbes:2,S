I love devfs but have no stomach for typing
	/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part5
when instead I could type
	/dev/hda5
Also, I switch back into 2.2 all the time, so updating /etc/fstab for
devfs is a PITA.
Thus... devfsd.  Put it really early in your boot process (I put it in
rc.sysinit), and it will take care of all those old data files which
haven't been converted over to devfs yet.
So, my install process was
	* install 2.3.x kernel
	* install devfsd & devfsd.conf
	* reboot
a couple 'make' commands, a couple 'cp' commands, and you're there...
