The problem is that if you start to decouple the chipset driver from the 
code which knows how to access the chip, you end up with lots of horrible 
indirect function calls in the inner loops. This isn't really going to help 
improve performance - and the serial driver has one of the biggest problems 
w.r.t latency already.
I figure I can get away with it for the MTD code (see the interaction 
between the CFI chipset code and the 'map' modules) because flash is 
generally slow as hell anyway, but for serial it's just not that feasible.
We have the same problem when readb() becomes something other than a 
#define or inline function.
One possibility for serial might be to reuse the generic chipset code in
source form rather than object form - i.e. define serial_readb() et al.
functions for your particular board/bus/mapping and then 
#include <generic_16550.c>. That's quite ugly though.
