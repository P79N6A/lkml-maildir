Subject: PROBLEM: networking - port 80 not accessible on eth0
To: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
I have a "VIA Technologies, VIA Technologies, Inc. VT6102 [Rhine-II]"
NIC connected to an ECI B-FOCuS 270PR ADSL model. I used fedora since
version 5. On FC5 (using kernel 2.6.15) the modem functioned as a
router, and it worked fine.
When I upgraded to FC6 (which was published with kernel 2.6.18) I
couldn't access any websites. I found out that I can access https, ftp
etc. but not http. I figured out that for some reason, port 80 was
blocked. When using VMWare with Windows, I could access websites.
I configured the modem to be a bridge, and I'm connecting through
pppoe. This way it works. Anyway, although I can access websites on
ppp0, I cannot access the modem itself (for configuration), which is
on eth0 port 80.
I attached a tcpdump when trying to connect to the modem (the same
applies for websites, when the modem is configured as a gateway):
After trying some different distributions (fedora up to 9, ubuntu 8.04
and 8.10), the problem remains. That's what leads me to the conclusion
that the problem is in the kernel.
ipv6 is disabled in modprobe.conf, so it is not the problem.
thanks ahead for your help.
