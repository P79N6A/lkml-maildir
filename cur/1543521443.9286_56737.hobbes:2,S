Better to break things once then to build kludge over kludge.

Of course the onlywayis to break current code :-) This way there are exist
chance that code will be fixed eventually. As far as existing code works
it'll NOT be fixed.

And will be fixed. It was done quite a few times. How many code was broken
in time of libc5 -> glibc switch ? It's fixed now or just thrown out.

The only way is to deliberately break all already broken code. Otherwise
it'll not be fixed till 2038...

This is Microsoft thinking :-) The sooner already broken code will be broken
the better (now there are great chances to find someone who knows how to fix
code; 30 years later such peoples will be out of business).
P.S. IMO such change belond to something like glibc 2.3/4 anyway. When kernel
will be changed is not so important: most programs will not use kernel
directly anyway.
