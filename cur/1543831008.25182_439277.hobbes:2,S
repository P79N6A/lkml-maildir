Didn't quite understand...could you please elaborate ?
Today we have a slab cache from which the taskstats structure gets 
allocated at the beginning
of the exit() path.
The upper limit to which you refer is the amount of slab memory the user 
is willing to be used
to store the bursty traffic ?

Yes it does. Thanks for the tips.
Will code up something and send out so this can become more concrete.
