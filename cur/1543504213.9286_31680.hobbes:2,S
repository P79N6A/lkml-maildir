Excuse me if I'm like putting my foot in my mouth, but can't you like jack
up the HZ to like 1000, update the time every interrupt.
Then every 10th time do the usual stuff.
Then user could loop gettimeofday() and get a good precision delay.
I mean many apps du like that on other platforms (or am I wrong here?).
And the rest of the kernel would be in the same state as before.
It's just an idea, i'm no kernel hacker. Please don't flame my box now.
