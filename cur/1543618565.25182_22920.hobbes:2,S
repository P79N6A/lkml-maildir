Have you tested with another NIC? I've witnessed a problem similar to 
yours recently (specific machines could login to a Samba server and i 
could ssh out to/from the server but file copies from Samba failed after 
copying 20-30 files. Please test with another NIC (another Tulip maybe?) 
so that we can determine wether its a hardware/kernel issue.
Also consider that Duron SMP is not a supported configuration, and 
therefore CPU/PIC based issues like APIC problems aren't going to get you 
far with some of the kernel hackers. Incidentally, what are the cpuids of 
your Durons?
