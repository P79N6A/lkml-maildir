Hi,
We have a problem on a 2.2.17: sometimes it crashs
without any reason (no high load), there is no kernel panic,
the screan is black. We setup watchdog software and
we realized watchdog can not reboot this box whe it crashs
(on the others servers it works fine).
my question is:
what kind of problem can have this serveur:
hardware or software ?
Thanks for help
Octave
