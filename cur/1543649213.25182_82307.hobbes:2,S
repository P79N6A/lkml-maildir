> The tridentfb driver isnt working very good
I did not get this to work, but I atleast managed to
get vesa-fb running. Vesa did not work on this machine
without UNIVBE, so I now use loadlin from a floppy to
load the kernel after Ive loaded UNIVBE, and then I use
vesafb, which seems to be working nicely, X using it
also. This should be pretty slow though. UNIVBE said
the chip had support for nearly nothing, and only
banked modes. Thats probably why the vesa-fb driver
didint work.
