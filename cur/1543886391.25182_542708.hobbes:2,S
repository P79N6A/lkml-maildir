You haven't given an example of where this might actually happen.
The driver is where the DMA mappings almost always occur because
that is the layer that knows the bus technology and therefore
the correct DMA interfaces to call.
What kind of driver do you have and what is this upper layer
doing the mappings for you but not giving you a pointer to
the kernel buffer as well?
