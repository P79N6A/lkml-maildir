Pat,
I have a set of patches that cleanly applies against the
http://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.5
 bitkeeper tree using quilt.  They are
not available for the rest of the world yet.  Could you move them from
~holt/ioif to the project's ftp directory on oss.sgi.com?
Thanks,
Robin
PS:  I found a few small problems with the bte code and will soon have
another patch that fixes that up.  Specifically, there were changes
made to bte_error.c and pda.h that are undone by your patch.
