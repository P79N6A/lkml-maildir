Something to consider down the track would be how to possibly allow this 
with SELinux, which only knows about normal mounts.
We might need a user_mount hook which is called once the core kernel code 
determines that it is a a valid unprivileged mount (although the sb_mount 
hook will already have been called, IIUC).
