Subject: [PATCH] initrd fails again in 2.5.18
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The initial ramdisk fails to work with a slew of errors like:
generic_make_request: Trying to access nonexistent block-device 01:00 (2)
The problem was caused by change
kdev_t -> bdev cleanups [2/2]
which took out the ability of bdev_get_queue() to create a queue if one didn't 
already exist for the device.  The functionality was moved to 
block_dev.c:do_open() where it exists within the if(!bdev->bd_openers) which 
the ramdisk never gets to.
The (tested) fix, I think, is to set bd_queue as part of ramdisk 
initialisation, which is what the attached patch does.
