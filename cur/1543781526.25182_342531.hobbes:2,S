I read the document, fixed the rules, and it works again. I've sent additional 
emails to the correct list this time outlining some other problems. I suspect 
they, too, are hotplug related.
(In future I'll read the documentation available in its entirety before 
pestering people. However, the way udev works is constantly changing and the 
problem I was seeing was seemingly inconsistent with an otherwise working 
udev, which made me think the problem was more deep seated..)
