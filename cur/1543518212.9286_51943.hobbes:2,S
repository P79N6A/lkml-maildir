In a few cases, yes.

No. Some architectures use an ioctl (different ioctls on different archs)
but on i386 the program kbdrate just writes /dev/port.
Probably 100ms would suffice. It seems that the key up event comes much earlier.
Note that scancode repeat is not good enough: many keys produce an e0 xx pair
and repeat that; more complicated things also occur.
So, you could consider intercepting repetition at the keycode instead of the
scancode level.
[I also find that aesthetically more satisfying: the scancode level really shows
the raw keyboard with all its quirks.]
