I have been looking at the emu10k1 driver and I had a few questions
about general idioms used there.
In a line like this,
[main.c, line 175]
	for (count = 0; count < sizeof(card->digmix) / sizeof(card->digmix[0]); count++) {
Isn't there some sort of `ALEN' macro available, or is this
considered to muddy things by using a macro?
[main.c, line 223]
	if ((card->mpuout = kmalloc(sizeof(struct emu10k1_mpuout), GFP_KERNEL))
Why is the struct type referenced for the allocation size?  Why not,
	if ((card->mpuout = kmalloc(sizeof(card->mpuout), GFP_KERNEL))
This seems to get the size for the actual object being allocated.
[cardmi.c, line 42]
static struct {
	int (*Fn) (struct emu10k1_mpuin *, u8);
} midistatefn[] = {
...
Why aren't all the gobs of constant data in this driver declared as
constant?  Do it give a performance advantage by having the data in a
different MMU section and better cache effects or something?
Thanks for any helpful pointers.  I did read the FAQ.  I am just
wonder if I would get screamed at for changing things like this and
why... so I will probably get yelled at for suggesting them anyway,
but at least I won't have went through the effort.  Now that I have
pointed that out, the will probably irk people even more...
regards,
Bill Pringlemeir.
