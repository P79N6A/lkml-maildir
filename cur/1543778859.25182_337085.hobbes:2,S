Still one nitpick:

I think you can just do:
	if (count > 0)
		while (isspace(*x))
			x++;
If the passed-in string was fully whitespace then the trailing-whitespace
stripping would already reduce it to count==0.  So as long as you check
for that case you can be sure that the while() will stop before x falls off
the end of the string.
Other than that it looks fine to me now.
