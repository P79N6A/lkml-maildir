Hi all!
I'm seeing my system freeze on heavy IO. Only the reset button brings it
back to life again (ALT-SysRq-b also worked once). I'm running SuSE's
2.4.18-30 on a Pentium III (Coppermine) with 256 MB RAM (yes, I should
try vanilla 2.4.18, I will ...)
No SCSI, all IDE. LVM and ext3.
I don't get any oopses, no entries in /var/log/messages, nothing. I
mounted the ext3 partitions with the debug option but still no messages.
What options can I turn on to search for the problem? Any kernel boot
options? LVM/ext3 options?
Many thanks, Richard
