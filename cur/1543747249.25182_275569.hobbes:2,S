That was already discussed earlier in the thread.

Ah, I see now -- the sun_path[0]=='\0' code.  I'll have to take a look
at that; probably just need to add a check to prevent jailed processes
from using those sockets (since they're supposed to be in a "null"
namespace)  Will investigate later this week.
It looks like this is also a weakness in code that currently uses
chroot("/var/empty")  It's not the end of the world since it still
requires a cooperating unjailed process on the same host as the jailed
one to pass in a fd which is quite an obstacle in most scenarios.  Still,
it's something that should be protected against.
