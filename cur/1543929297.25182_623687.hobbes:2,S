Intel's newest dual 10GbE NIC can easily (?) throw ~14M packets per
second. (theoretical peak at 1514bytes/frame)
Granted, installing such a device on a single CPU/single core machine is
absurd - but even on an 8 core machine (2 x Xeon 53xx/54xx / AMD
Barcelona) it can still generate ~1M packets/s per core.
Now assuming you're doing low-level (passive) filtering of some sort
(frame/packet routing, traffic interception and/or packet analysis)
using hardware assistance (TSO, complete TCP offloading, etc) is off the
table and each and every cycle within netif_receive_skb (and friends)
-counts-.
I don't suggest that the kernel should be (re)designed for such (niche)
applications but on other hand, if it works...
