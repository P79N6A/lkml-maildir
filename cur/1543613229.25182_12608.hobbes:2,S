We're down to just 32 missing Configure.help entries, thanks to excellent
cooperation from the ARM developers and a siege of rooting through kernel 
sources by yours truly.  That's a big improvement from 96 last week.
If you can supply a Configure.help entry for any of these

It will be of little avail to the people, that the laws are made by
men of their own choice, if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot
be read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood; if they be
repealed or revised before they are promulgated, or undergo such
incessant changes that no man, who knows what the law is to-day, can
guess what it will be to-morrow. Law is defined to be a rule of
action; but how can that be a rule, which is little known, and less
fixed?
