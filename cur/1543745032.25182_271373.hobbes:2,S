i just found a potential problem that could cause a near-lockup during
module removal. This code in __module_put_and_exit() could loop for
quite long time:
        while (current->lock_depth != -1)
                unlock_kernel();
since for specifically ALSA's no-BKL purpose i've introduced the notion
of ->lock_depth going below -1. So if we happen to put the module while
->lock_depth is -2, it could take quite some time for it to go down to
zero again ... (and it could cause other problems as well)
i fixed this in the -V0.7.27-2 release, freshly uploaded to the usual
place:

do you still see lockups with this patch?
