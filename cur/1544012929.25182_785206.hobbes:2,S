AFAICS the commit ca109491f612aab5c8152207631c0444f63da97f
"hrtimer: removing all ur callback modes" with "Impact: cleanup, move 
all hrtimer processing into hardirq context"
did not find it's way into linux-2.6.git - is there any reason for this?
I reworked some of my code in net/can/bcm.c so that it uses tasklets in 
the cases i needed the soft-irq context and therefore it can cope with 
the hrtimers running always in hard-irq context now.
I'll send a patch to Dave the next days after some more testing on your 
latest sched-devel -tip tree. It works fine so far. From my side you can 
go ahead with the hrtimer reduction to hard-irq context (for 2.6.29).
Regards,
Oliver
