I'll be integrating fixes directly into my usual net-2.6 tree at:
	kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net-2.6.git
so folks should submit fixes against that.

I've cut a tree with this 2.6.25 network device driver stuff
that people can submit against at:
	kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/netdev-2.6.git
Thanks.
