There must be another reason, I'm running a 80486/4Mb (Compaq Contura)
with 2.4.20 just fine. Even networking is present. You need lots of
swap, though.

The very minimum? 4Mb + lots of swap. To make it closer to usable, I'd
say 8Mb. Altough, I had this setup on my Contura: Contura connects to
the main box via plip, another laptop (old Thinkpad) connects to Contura
via ppp, and Contura NATs it through the main box. Meanwhile, I could
run mutt, reading e-mail, and zile, editing some documentation. Both
from screen. And I've been logged into the machine via ssh.
It was a bit slow, but worked. So 4Mb _is_ enough, even for running
Debian sid.
