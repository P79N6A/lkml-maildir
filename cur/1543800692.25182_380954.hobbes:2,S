Konqueror manages to "wrap" plugins quite happily.. complain to whoever makes

This argument is basically watered down with devfs, udev, sysfs, etc. which 
all have exactly the same issues. Should a crippled OSS API be the way 
forward for Linux? I think not.

Okay, I agree it's not ideal. But if you want software mixing, and it's a 
genuinely useful feature, you either have to go down the road of running some 
crappy daemon like arts or esound, or just link against libasound and get it 
for free. I know I'd rather not have mixing routines in my kernel, thanks.
