With __in_dev_get() it's the caller's responsibility to ensure
that RCU works correctly.  Therefore if any rcu_dereference is
needed it should be done by the caller.
Some callers of __in_dev_get() don't need rcu_dereference at all
because they're protected by the rtnl.
BTW, could you please move the rcu_dereference in in_dev_get()
into the if clause? The barrier is not needed when ip_ptr is
NULL.
Thanks,
