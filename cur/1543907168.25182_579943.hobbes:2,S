I think there's really no other choice here.
Your patch is changing the API in a very unsafe way, since there will
be no error or warning on an unconverted fs.  And that could lead to
security holes.
If we would rename the setattr method to setattr_new as well as
changing it's behavior, that would be fine.  But I guess we do not
want to do that.
