But not on the same CPU, which is the only thing done in the given
implementation.

Fine, a ratio of 2 or even probably 4 is ok.  If it was a ratio of 10:1
or 20:1, that might be an issue if we had no between-CPU ratio  
adjustment,
but otherwise it's just guesstimation, so it's not that important to be
accurate.

The time periods under consideration are so small (and due to the way
it's used, especially WRT the running average, if the CPU changes
frequencies in mid-calculation, we don't really care about same-CPU
changes, as long as we can usually guess about between-CPU ratios.

Not exactly that short.  There will usually be several hundred  
instructions
in between, at _least_, otherwise you'd just use a normal spinlock to
minimize overhead.

This is a best-guess as to whether the CPU should put the process to  
sleep
and go do something else if it can or just poll.  If we're wrong either
way it doesn't matter much, we'll effectively default back to the old
dumb behavior.

Ick!  Is there any other kind of fast cycle counter on a P4?
