Yes, it depends on the selected governor.
In the case of "userspace" governor you (or a program) can set the speed
writing to "/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_setspeed".
Usually a deamon monitor the CPU usage and increase the frequency when
you need it.

"ps -A" and look for something like "cpufreqd"
There are different deamon for this: cpufreqd, cpudyn...
Anyway it is started by an init script, so you should find it looking
at "ls /etc/init.d/".
