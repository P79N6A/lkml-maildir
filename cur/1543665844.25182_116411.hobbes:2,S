I'm still not quite following that. But as long as we're both pointing
at the same code and grunting in agreement I think I'll just let it
slide ;)

Actually, what is the difference between the call you're trying to
implement and monotonic_clock() (outside of the timespec return)?  Could
you point me to the specific code you are describing? It sounds like
we're working on basically the same solution from two different angles.

Well, if the generic interfaces aren't providing what you need, then a
new interface needs to be considered. This is precisely what the
hangcheck-timer code ran into, and is why we're working on this
monotonic_clock() code (which is intended be arch independent in the
future).
