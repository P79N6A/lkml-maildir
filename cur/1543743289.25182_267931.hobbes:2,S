It took around 2 minutes for the logout of X to get back to a VC.
So obviously something slowed it down as thats a 4 second operation 
here normally.  And it didn't surprise me when the "reboot" shutdown 
hung on "stopping alsasound" and I had to use the reset button.

This from my viewpoint, is wrong.  The kernel, and only the kernel 
should be ultimately responsible for handing out resources, and 
reclaiming at its convienience.

Thats the fault of the design IMO.

It did have quite a few authors involved in it over the years 
including me, I did many of its utilities, and converted the rbf.mn 
from 6809 code to 6309 code, roughly doubleing its speed without 
fiddling with the clock speed, which is married to the video on that 
machine.  I also did a couple of its clock modules, which are the 
heart of the multitasking it does.  And yes, it could kill, 
absolutely cleanly, any process you named on the command line at any 
time.  Any drivers involved got their scratch space from the callers 
loading of a set of pointers, so if a driver was being accessed by 2 
or more processes, each instance had its own stack/process space.  
When the process disappeared, the recovery included that space in 
memory.  The driver proper had no long term history of that processes 
actions, even if a disk seek microsleep or similar was in progress 
when the caller disappeared.

As I said earlier, lets let this horse be buried, "its dead Jim", and 
my beating on it is only wasting bandwitdh.
