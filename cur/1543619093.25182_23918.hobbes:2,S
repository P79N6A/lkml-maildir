No no no.
That is a really stupid idea, even though every single OS developer has at
some time thought that it was the great idea (and it shows up in a lot of
OS's).
The reason it is a stupid idea is that if you do it, you can no longer
share page tables between CPU's (unless all CPU's you support have TLB
fill in software).
