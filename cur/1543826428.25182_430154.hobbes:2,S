Did you write all (most) of it? If not, you'd have to ask the original
author(s).
BTW, thinking it over in the shower today, if/when this is translated into
asciidoc(1) (or whatever), a "source code" license (like GPLv2) would be
appropiate IMHO. Besides, using the same license as what it describes is
sensible.

The license text spells it out ;-)
I would add language to that effect to the README file, and bundle the
standard COPYING file with the package
