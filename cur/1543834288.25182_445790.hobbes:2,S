I think I found it...
I upgraded to a new MB, amd64 X2 4200 and a new Gfx card. The problem got much 
much worse. Then it started to hang on boot in the BIOS checks for HD's... 
Turns out it was the cable... Unplugging the drive from the MB fixed it, 
plugging it back in worked for a bit & died again.
I changed the cable and haven't had a problem for a week now.
TIA
