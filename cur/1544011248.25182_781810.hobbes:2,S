I just pulled from Linus and the Kernel I booted gave me this:

It looks like userspace starts here. A bisect leads to

|    powerpc/fsl-booke: Fix problem with _tlbil_va being interrupted
| 
|    An example calling sequence which we did see:
| 
|    copy_user_highpage -> kmap_atomic -> flush_tlb_page -> _tlbil_va
| 
|    We got interrupted after setting up the MAS registers before the
|    tlbwe and the interrupt handler that caused the interrupt also did
|    a kmap_atomic (ide code) and thus on returning from the interrupt
|    the MAS registers no longer contained the proper values.
| 
|    Since we dont save/restore MAS registers for normal interrupts we
|    need to disable interrupts in _tlbil_va to ensure atomicity.
