I'd also be interested to know the answer here. Jens?
Some Gentoo users have reported that commands such as ED/EB/E9/F5 are being 
rejected. When inspecting the cdrecord source code, it seems that these are 
specific to plextor drives. These drives are MMC but have a few 
vendor-specific extensions. How should we go about permitting cases like this 
in the command filter?
Thanks,
Daniel
