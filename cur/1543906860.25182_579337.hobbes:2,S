Think about the user for a moment instead. 
Do things right. The job of the kernel is not to "correct" for
distribution policy decisions. The distributions need to change policy.
You do that by showing the distributions the numbers. 
With a Red Hat on if we can move from /dev/hda to /dev/sda in FC7 then we
can move from atime to noatime by default on FC8 with appropriate release
note warnings and having a couple of betas to find out what other than
mutt goes boom.
