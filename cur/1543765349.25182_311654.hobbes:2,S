Not much migration would be needed other than deleting from the
current kernel.  As long as the lagacy filesystem exists in a kernel
that has UML support it should just work.

Yes, this is the very heart of the conflict between my and your
(Christoph's, etc) view.
I argue for more flexibilty, i.e. less policy in kernel, which is a
good thing generally.  
As long as it's secure, what is the problem with it?  If users are
confused, then they will chose the strict mode.  If somebody would
like to see more information in the filesystem, they use the relaxed
mode.
The key here is security IMO.  So if you find a security problem with
the relaxed mode (together with "hiding") then I bow my head.
Otherwise who cares if it confuses applications (haven't met any) or
users.  It doensn't matter.  If it confuses anything or anyone, the
filesystem writer can fix it.

Ssh into UML is awkward, because you don't necessary have all the
tools installed, have networking, etc.  And in UML the uid/gid won't
make any more sense either.

Well you can use "ls -n".  It's up to the tools to present the
information you want in the way you want it.  If a tool can't do that,
tough, but you are not worse off than if the information is not
available _at_all_.
Thanks,
