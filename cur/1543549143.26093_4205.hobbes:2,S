I have been doing some testing just to see how well the new VM stuff
works.  I think I have found a bug in both test9-pre1 and test9-pre2.
If I boot my machine (400MHz AMD-K6 3D+, 128M Ram, IDE disks, 512M swap)
with mem=48M added to the LILO command line and try and build mozilla, the
machine will eventually die.  I can still ping it, but I cant connect to
the http or sshd servers, I cant get anything to show up on the monitor,
and the disk does not make any noise.  After I reboot (and fsck :-<),
the logs do not contain any information about what happened.
If I run test8 instead of one of the test9 kernels then everything
seems to work.  If I dont limit the memory to 48M then the test9 kernels
work fine.
I am attaching the script that I use to build mozilla just in case anyone
wants to try and reproduce this.
Thanks,
Jim
