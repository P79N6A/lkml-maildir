The root partition was originally ext3.  fstab now contains
/dev/sda1               /                       ext2    defaults        1 1
Booting 2.4.20-rc1 (ext3 as a module, not loaded yet) with a dirty / gets
EXT2-fs: sd(8,1): couldn't mount because of unsupported optional features (4).
Drop back to 2.4.18 and it works, automatically running fsck.ext2 -a /dev/sda1.
