umm, no, the ## is removed and you are left with:
undefined reference to `unsafe_min_or_max_at_line___LINE__'
The best I can think of would be something like:
asm(".unsafe_use_of_min_or_max_in_" __FUNCTION__)
which would not give you the line number, as the line number is only avalable in
integer form, I doubt you will be able to get that very well. The assembler will
give a line in relation to the asm, rather than the C, which is not what you
want...

Those are in relation to the assembler, not the C code..
