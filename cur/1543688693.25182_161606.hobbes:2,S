Agreed.

Yes, but I'm fairly sure they were racy.  Which is enough for me to
dislike it.
Rehashing when the ->mapping changes is simple and clear.  It's fairly
easy to push it up to the callers, and then I'll figure out which ones
are adding new pages, and which ones are moving pages from one
->mapping to another (these ones we care about).  But it has to be
under the same locks (ie. rehashing and changing the mapping an atomic
operation) otherwise someone has to prove that noone can do a futex
lookup on the page with the new mapping before it's been updated in
the hash.
The other possibility is to use some lock we already have, rather than
the futex_lock, to protect that PG_futexed bit.
I'll keep working on it.  I'm learning more about the VM, at least.
Thanks,
Rusty.
