i2c is used to directly talk to motherboard hardware such as temperature
sensors. I've seen cases of certain chipset bugs leading to cacheline
corruption when stuff talked to the slow i2c bus and did other stuff in
parallel. 
microcode changes the microcode of the cpu (a part of your cpu is
actually written in "software" that can be updated); however updating
this behind the back of the bios might not always be a good idea. (but I
have no hard proof of any failures due to this)
As for how to disable these.. you could just rename the respective .ko
files to .notko or something....
