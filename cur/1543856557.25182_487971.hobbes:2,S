The point you're missing is that an "inactive" page is a free page  
that happens to have known clean data on it corresponding to  
something on disk.  If you need to use the inactive page for  
something all you have to do is either zero it or fill it with data  
from elsewhere.  There is _no_ practical reason for the kernel to  
turn an "inactive" page into a "free" page.  On my Linux systems  
after heavy local-disk and network intensive read-only load I have no  
more than 2% "free" memory, most of the rest is "inactive" (in one  
case some 2GB of it).  There's nothing _wrong_ with that much  
"inactive" memory, it just means that you were using it for data at  
one point, then didn't need it anymore and haven't reused it since.

Nope; the pages will continue to contain valid data until you  
overwrite them with new data somehow.  Now, if they were "dirty"  
pages, containing unwritten data, then you would be correct.

In this case you're telling the kernel to go beyond its normal  
housekeeping and delete perfectly good data from memory.  The only  
reason to do that is usually to make benchmarks mildly more  
repeatable and doing it on a regular basis tends to kill performance.
