Well, since I moved the rsync to 5pm, and then back to 9pm, I haven't
seen this problem - everything is again working as expected (touch wood)
with 2.2.15pre13 and 2.4.0.
This is odd, since it wasn't a one-off problem, but something that happened
each and every day of a particular week.  Anyway, if it starts happening
again, I'll get a tcpdump of the session.
