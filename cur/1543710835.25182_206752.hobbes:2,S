Dear all,
Am having problems using my mouse wheel on 2.6.3, when it worked fine in
2.4.24.
Technically it's not a mouse, but a trackball. And technically not a wheel,
but a couple of buttons. But this shouldn't make any difference, should it?
When I click the scroll buttons they are both treated as middle-click (button
2) when they should be treated as scrolling (buttons 4 and 5) -- this is
according to xev.
The mouse is plugged into the PS/2 port, but I also have the USB mouse stuff
compiled as a module just in case I change my mind.
I think I've tried most of the suggestions I could find in the archive and
on Google.
Using hexdump on /dev/input/mice, the signals sent for up and down scroll
buttons seem identical to each other.
Here is some (possibly relevent) information:
[tai@ophelia (pts/1) ~]$ cat /boot/config | grep -i mouse ; echo ''
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV=y
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV_PSAUX=y
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV_SCREEN_X=1024
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSEDEV_SCREEN_Y=768
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSE=y
CONFIG_MOUSE_PS2=y
# CONFIG_MOUSE_SERIAL is not set
# CONFIG_MOUSE_INPORT is not set
# CONFIG_MOUSE_LOGIBM is not set
# CONFIG_MOUSE_PC110PAD is not set
CONFIG_USB_MOUSE=m
[tai@ophelia (pts/1) ~]$ dmesg | grep -i mouse ; echo ''
mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
input: PS/2 Logitech Mouse on isa0060/serio1
[tai@ophelia (pts/1) input]$ cat /proc/bus/input/devices|tac|tail -n 8|tac
I: Bus=0011 Vendor=0002 Product=0001 Version=006d

H: Handlers=mouse0 
B: EV=7

And here's some stuff from XF86Config-4:
Section "InputDevice"
    Identifier  "Mouse1"
    Driver      "mouse"
    Option      "SendCoreEvents"        "true"
    Option      "Device"                "/dev/input/mice"
    Option      "Protocol"              "ExplorerPS/2"
    Option      "Buttons"               "5"
    Option      "Emulate3Buttons"
    Option      "Emulate3Timeout"       "50"
    Option      "ZAxisMapping"          "4 5"
EndSection
# [...]
Section "ServerLayout"
    Identifier "layout1"
    InputDevice "Keyboard1" "CoreKeyboard"
    InputDevice "Mouse1" "CorePointer"
    Screen "screen1"
    InputDevice "Mouse1" "SendCoreEvents"
EndSection
                                     
                                     
Any suggesitons?
Thanks in advance for any light than can be shed.
