Actually, I think it turns out that knowing the sequence of "random"
values that were written can make reading the overwritten data easier.
If this is indeed the case, you want something mildly more secure...
Here's an idea for what I think will be a relatively secure PRNG (but
I'm not a cryptographer):  Take 2 values generated in a secure manner,
storing one of them in memory.  Perform a cryptographic hash over these
two values; use the results as your first random value.  When you need
another random value, perform another cryptographic hash over the first
value, which you saved, and the last generated value.
Properties I see here:
* Because you're using cryptographic hashes, you cannot easily recover
  a previous value in the sequence given a later value.
* Because you're performing the hashes with an unknown value in
  addition to previous values of the sequence, it is difficult to
  predict later values in the sequence.
Of course, this relies on the security of the hash you choose, and the
source of your initial random values also needs to be very secure;
knowledge of the seed would still give away the whole sequence.
