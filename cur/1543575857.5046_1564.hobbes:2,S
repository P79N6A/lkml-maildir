Just to add my 2 bits, I have an AlphaServer 1000A that has a pci-pci
bridge.  I put an adaptec 2940UW on the primary pci bus.  After attempts to
mke2fs on a raid0 set (using 2.2.17 /w and w/o raid patches), it would just
lock and I'd have to reboot the machine.  I was able (IIRC) to remount r/o
the other disk that I had.
