At first I didn't want to do this because it would have needed to recurse
down to other users of skb. But I've just checked and noticed that indeed,
only skb_copy_bits() uses the skb, and this one already expects a const. So
you're right, and I should have checked further. My bad.
Marcelo, could you please use this simpler patch instead ?
Thanks,
