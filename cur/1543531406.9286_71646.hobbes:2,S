Not really.  If *they* need linux for something then *they* adapt it
and contribute any patches.  I don't plan on a minimal linux, quite the
opposite,
I was pointing out that some embedded devices might actually need the
advanced 
features.  Instead of a minimal os that don't do much.

Simple embedded device need that mini-os.  Complicated embedded devices
can use more - such as a linux kernel with all core features.

Maybe someone holds that opinion, certainly not me.
