Is this a plead for dropping all rz1000, cmd640, "soundblaster cdromdrive"
and other "useless" drivers from the kernel source ?
How many people will actually use ham radio ?
If you look at it this way you can strip over 80 % of all options from

I bet you have a windows 95 CD with just the DLLs on it you personally use
