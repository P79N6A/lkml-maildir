Subject: [BUG] cpu_khz isn't reliable at boot time

In mobile system, BIOS usually sets CPU to low speed. In modern CPU, TSC
is constant speed regardless of CPU speed. Linux uses TSC to calculate
cpu_khz, which is the full speed frequence of CPU instead of low speed
in some systems. This might invoke some potential issues. One is NMI
watchdog, which runs less frequently in cpu low speed mode.
Below workaround from Len addressed the NMI issue, any idea?
