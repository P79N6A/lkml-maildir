Subject: [PATCH] Makefile -- nuke System.map 'w' symbols

GNU nm 2.9.5 produces 'w' symbols in the System.map file on the Alpha,
corresponding to the different Alpha system types.  They have no addresses
and cause errors in programs that read System.map.  This patch to the top
level Makefile gets rid of them.
