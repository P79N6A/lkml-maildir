Man stopped working after upgrade from test5-pre6 to test6-pre9. x86 UP.
man: can't set effective uid: Operation not permitted
Other setuid programs seem to work well (tested only some, they didn't
appear to trigger it because of different usage patterns).
strace on man:
...
getuid()                                = 557
execve("/usr/lib/man-db/man", ["man", "man"], [/* 16 vars */]) = 0
...
getuid()                                = 557
geteuid()                               = 6
geteuid()                               = 6
setuid(557)                             = 0
...
geteuid()                               = 557
setuid(6)                               = 0
...
geteuid()                               = 6
setuid(557)                             = -1 EPERM (Operation not permitted)
