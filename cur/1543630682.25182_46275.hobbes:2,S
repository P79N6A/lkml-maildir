Of course that's one and a half.  initrd.txt changed in 2.4.0-test12
to be exact.
However, we shouldn't break the old initrd method in 2.4 - that's
what 2.5 is for, but ext3 is a new feature introduced after in 2.4.9.
So, the question becomes - is it reasonable to expect new features
introduced in a stable kernel series to work with obsolete methods
that have already been replaced with far better solutions.
