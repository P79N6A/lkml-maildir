Simple. Between 0x10480 and 0x10800 there are 0x380 bytes available.
That makes 895 characters for the commandline. Completly obvious, how
could you miss it ? ;-)
The reason is our initial address space layout for the very first kernel
images. Now it is hard to changed because the different ipl tools rely
on the layout. We choose to add a few more bytes than 256 because on
s390 we potentially have many devices. The dasd= parameter can really be
big.
