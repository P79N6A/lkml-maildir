don't want to disturbe ... maybe i didn't get the right mailing list, but general sounds good ....
today i tried to compile a newer kernel version ... i thought i made anything right so far ... but things aren't always as easy as they seem to be, especially for a newbie ... 
configured kernel, created bzImage, modules ... installed them in  the correct paths ... configured lilo.conf and executed lilo ...
as result first "anything" works fine, while reboot, until lilo tries to load the new kernel:
Loading kernelxyz .... -> black screen: but the laptop ( gericom webshocks,with mini - pci - bussytem ) still seems to work in the background ...
still i would be glad if anybody, who knows what went wrong, could take some time and give me a hind about troubleshooting
THX  DK :)
