Precisely.  This applies against Linus' kernel:
Name: Fix overzealous use of online cpu iterators
Status: Trivial
The IA64 hotplug CPU merge seems to have included some core changes: in
particular the recalc_bh_state() needs to sum for all (including
offline) cpus, since we don't empty the counters on CPU down.  I don't
know that anyone cares about the accuracy of the /proc/stat when CPUs go
down, but certainly the totals printed (the first loop) should include
offline cpus.
