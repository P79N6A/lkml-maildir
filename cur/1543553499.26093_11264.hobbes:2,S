I seem to recall when reading about sigaction in APUE, that while sigaction 
solves many of the races that can come up with various "signal" 
implementations, there were still some cases where there was no way to do 
what was desired without races.  Is there ANY way (in theory, at least) to 
create a race-free signalling system?
