Yes, just this morning I decided to tidy away some of the old
tarballs into a newly created "old" directory.

Well, there never really was.  To date, most old tarballs have
had only a limited life on kernel.org.

As noted above old versions never were "always available" on
kernel.org...

How about a link in /pub/linux/docs/manpages/ of the form 
"LATEST-IS-m.xy"?  Rob Landley was wanting something like this,
and I guess it would be easy for LFS to build a simple
script that looks for that link and deduces "man-pages-m.xy" 
from it.  (I've just now created such a link in the directory,
as an example.)
Cheers,
Michael
