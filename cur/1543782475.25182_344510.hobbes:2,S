The application is a database system called Caché.  We allocate a large 
shared memory segment for database cache, which in a large production 
environment may realistically be 1+GB on 32-bit platforms and much 
larger on 64-bit.  At these sizes fork() is taking hundreds of 
miliseconds, which can become a noticeable bottleneck for us.  This 
performance characteristic seems to be unique to Linux vs other Unix 
implementations.
