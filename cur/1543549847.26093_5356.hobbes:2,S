Sorry to bother all ya important ones.
I'm about to disect 2.4, however the little bugger won't boot.
I suspect the milo. Which is built for 2.2.13. 
I assume I need a new one, however I have falied to find one
for 2.4, do I need a special version/compiler etc.
I have a ruffian board.(arc bios)
Thanks for all the effort you guys/gals put in.
