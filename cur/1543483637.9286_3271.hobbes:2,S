A similar problem (Sony DDS2 tape, AHA1542CF) happened to me too,
reported on this mailing list a few months ago. It happened when
I tried to read an old tape that was written with an unknown
MAC backup software (I think it was on a HP drive... I'm talking
6 or 7 years back). I did not have a problem with over-writing
these tapes and then reading back. I kept one of them just for
the case that it might be useful for debugging. I'm guessing that
there is some valid data on the tape and I would expect Linux to
be able to read the raw data (if not decode it!). I can test
patches on request (please send me the patch itself or a URL).
(Linux 2.2.x, single processor, AHA1542CF or AHA2940UW, Sony SDT7000).
