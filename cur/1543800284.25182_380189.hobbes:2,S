Some new info, i just noticed this in the logs:
Dec 30 22:21:24 localhost kernel: bttv0: OCERR @ 1fde0000,bits: HSYNC
OFLOW FBUS OCERR*
Dec 30 22:21:24 localhost last message repeated 5 times
Dec 30 22:21:24 localhost kernel: bttv0: timeout: drop=0
irq=41296/41296, risc=1fde001c, bits: HSYNC OFLOW
Dec 30 22:21:24 localhost kernel: bttv0: reset, reinitialize
Dec 30 22:21:24 localhost kernel: bttv0: PLL: 28636363 => 35468950 . ok
But vmware is not active at this moment, i'll not use vmware and see if
a freeze occurs, i'll test up to 24 hours.
I can swear it might have to do with the tvcard with tv on and vmware at
the same time also active. Or maybe just 1 of them. I'm even considering
to buy tomorrow a new tvcard and see if it makes any difference.
