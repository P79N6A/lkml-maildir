Anyway,

Ok, I cannot see this one, I have no APM enabled on my boxes. Sorry.

This is interesting.                                                  
I have not set up a guest linux yet, but I experienced a problem with 
Win98 guest which may sound related:                                  
I start the guest win98 and try to open a dos-window. The window opens
but no output is presented (no prompt, no nothing) and guest system   
somehow "hangs". Sometimes (rarely) I can make it work again by       
hitting keys on the keyboard. The effect started off as window coming 
up with prompt, I tried to ping the host system, and the first packet 
was somehow slow, but then everything was ok. On the next guest boot, 
some output appeared at the dosbox, but the prompt was delayed. Now I 
get no prompt no matter what I try.                                   
Host system is 2.4.18-pre7.                                           
Vmware was installed from scratch, win98 guest was installed from     
scratch with no additions whatsoever.                                 
ping from host to guest works flawlessly.

As I never saw this with vmware 2 (even not on 2.4.18-pre7) I would   
say version 3 has a real problem somewhere.
