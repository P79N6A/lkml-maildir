It doesn't, but the Alpha is a *much* more recent ABI... the x86 ABI
really dates back to the 16-bit 8086-series CPUs.

We tried once; at that point the register-based ABI support in gcc was
too buggy to be useful.  We might try again in 2.5 since we now have
increased the minimum gcc version for kernel compiles.  Binutils needs no
change.
