Yes, I agree.
I would like to know:
- local or remote exploitable
- if a DoS: hang, only service failure, major slowdown 
- privilege escalation possiible and how far (valid user, root, kernel-level)
- required privileges (root or user)
That would help risk management a lot :-)
If you have a lot of time: Affected software components, but these can
be taken from the patches/commit info or CVE.
Thanks & Regards
