Subject: loading version nonsensitive module into version sensitive kernel?

Hi!
We have a driver which (unfortunately) is not open source.
We deliver this driver in binary format (as an rpm) to customers.
Customers sometimes add patches or use newer kernels than what
we compiled with. With versioning (which is default on and *mostly* a
good thing in my opinion) symbol names change and our driver module does
not load. We do not wish to tell our customers to disable versioning.
Is there any way of getting around this?
Our only option at this time seems to be demangling the ksyms
and our module symbols, match them and replace the module symbol
references with the new ones in ksyms (using libbfd or some such).
Not an ideal solution...
What is the "correct" way of doing it? Even with open source kernel
external modules one would like to be able to avoid recompiling them
after doing a minor change in the kernel configuration??
Enlighten me, but please be gentle ;-)
Sincerely
