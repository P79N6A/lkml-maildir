This would be the first time I sent it to them.

Ok I'll use CONFIG_PNP instead.  Thanks for pointing this out.

I'm not quite sure what you mean here.

Actually pnp_register_driver is implemented in this way.  The reason it
has #ifdef around it is becuase of the previous #ifdef statement
(where parport_pc_pnp_driver is defined).
Also I had a hotplug related question?  Is it possible for pnp drivers
to use this and if so what do I need to do?
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(pnp, pnp_dev_table);
These comments have been very helpful.
Thanks,
Adam
