Sure. Got it, compiled, but got the error:
   .../usr/include/scsi/sg.h /usr/include/scsi/scsi.h
   /usr/include/stdint.h   sg_lib.h sg_cmds.h llseek.h
   gcc: cannot specify -o with -c or -S and multiple compilations
   make: *** [sgp_dd.o] Error 1
I could only find  -o  and  -c  in the makefiles around line 95.
Slack 9.1 / 2.6.10 from sources.
It's 4am, I'm off to bed, sorry :p
