OK, thanks!

Backwards compatibility.  The code has to keep working under older
kernel versions too in order to pass the regression tests, and the
simplest thing is to put the front while loop in an ifdef while I work
on it.  At some stage soon I'll do as you want. Things have stopped
oopsing on write now, and I've sent it for testing.
That's also why I have the io_lock around the whole code instead of
only the last part. I have to put it around something that at least
existed in 2.2 and even 2.0. I've stepped the version number and will
be revising the code while its being tested. But thanks for the
concern :-). I appreciate it!
