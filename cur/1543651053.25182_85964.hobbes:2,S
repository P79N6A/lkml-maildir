While discussing various topics related to Linux and the BSDs, this
thread was mentioned.

The following paper
Performance Analysis of TLS Web Servers.

  In Proceedings of NDSS '02, 2002.

analyzes the performance benefits from off-loading various crypto
operations to cryptographic hardware accelerators in comparison to
software crypto.  This is in the context of web servers and TLS.
The paper concludes that hardware accelerators are useful for speeding
up public key cryptography, whereas symmetric encryption (RC4) does not
benefit from hardware acceleration very much.
For public-key cryptography, the used bus bandwidth is not significant
because data transfers are usually small.
On the other hand, there are some Ethernet cards that support inline
encryption so that not additional bus bandwidth is required to do both
public and symmetric key cryptography.
Things are slightly different for expensive symmetric encryption
algorithms like 3DES.  See

Angelos Keromytis has designed an API for cryptographic services in
the kernel.  The implementation provides a good abstraction.
Anyway, now you have some numbers.
