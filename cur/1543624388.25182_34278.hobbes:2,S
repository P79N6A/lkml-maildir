Hi !
I guess u need to read user space from kernel sapce.
You can use the sys_call_table functions for this.
For example, u can use the following code in your file to open a user space 
file from kernel space.
#define BEGIN_KMEM {mm_segment_t old_fs=get_fs();set_fs(get_ds());
#define END_KMEM set_fs(old_fs);}
int (*sample_open)(char *, int);
sample_open = sys_call_table[SYS_open];
BEGIN_KMEM
sample_open("/home/samplefile.txt",O_RDWR);
/* the same way close , read , write etc. can be  written */
END_KMEM
