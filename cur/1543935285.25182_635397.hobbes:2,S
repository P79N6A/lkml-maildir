The PIT usage for calibrating the delay loop can be moderated, if need 
by, by using the PC BIOS which by definition uses the PIT correctly it 
its int 15 function 83 call..   Just do it before coming up in a state 
where the PC BIOS int 15h calls no longer work.  I gave code to do this 
in a much earlier message.
This is the MOST reliable way to use the PIT early in boot, on a PC 
compatible.  God knows how one should do it on a Macintosh running a 
386/20  :-).   But the ONLY old bat-PIT machines are, thank god, PC 
compatible, maybe.
