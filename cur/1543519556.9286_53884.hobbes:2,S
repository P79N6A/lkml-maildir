This isn't a particularly good motivation, though (if anything it
indicates the /dev names have been made too verbose, and so noone will
use them -- the Solaris trap)  What *is* important, however, is to
have umount(8) accept what is given to mount(8), even when the "user"
option is enabled etc.
There is also a race condition in mount/umount when using the "user"
option.  The most sensible way of fixing it seems to be to have
fmount/fumount.
