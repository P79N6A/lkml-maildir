We're pretty much stuck with the API, until we look at merging ALSA in
2.5.x.  Broken API or not, OSS is a mature API, and there are
spec-correct apps that depend on this behavior.
(FWIW, ALSA nicely marginalizes its OSS support into a single module, so
that ALSA drivers aren't affected by OSS' ugliness)
