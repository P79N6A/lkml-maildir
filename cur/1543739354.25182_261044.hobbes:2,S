Hi,
I have a Dell Inspiron 1100 which has a Broadcom b44 built-in ethernet
card. It appears that the subsystem_vendor and subsystem_device fields are
being returned to userspace in the wrong order. Dell's PCI ID is 0x0128.
The output below is with 2.6.9-rc4.
$ lspci -v
[...]
0000:00:1f.5 Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corp. 82801DB/DBL/DBM (ICH4/ICH4-L/ICH4-M) AC'97 Audio Controller (rev 02)
        Subsystem: Dell: Unknown device 0149
[...]
0000:02:01.0 Ethernet controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4401 100Base-T (rev 01)
        Subsystem: Unknown device 4401:1028

$ # audio controller
$ cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:00\:1f.5/subsystem_vendor 
0x1028
$ cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:00\:1f.5/subsystem_device
0x0149
$ # network controller
$ cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:02\:01.0/subsystem_vendor
0x4401
$ cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:02\:01.0/subsystem_device
0x1028
I had a quick look at b44.c and b44.h and couldn't see anything obvious
and from emailing a few people it was suggested I email here. 
Thanks,
Anand
