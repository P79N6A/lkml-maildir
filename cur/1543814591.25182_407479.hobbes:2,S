That has nothing to do with linux at all.
"Now flow control in udp" is a udp design issue.  And it is not
a flaw either - the rule is simple:
If you need flow control - use tcp.
If you don't need flow control, and don't want the
overhead of flow control - use udp.
Udp is for those cases where flow control is consideres a waste of time.
Now, the original decision to base early NFS on udp, that was
a design mistake.  Again, not a linux problem but a nfs problem.
Fortunately, today a solution for this exists and is implemented
in linux - and it is nfs over tcp.

Hard to say.  I guess someone thought they could get better
performance with udp - it has less overhead.,
Then didn't bother testing this idea with a somewhat congested network?
