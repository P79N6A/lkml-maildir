You don't.  Normal users aren't allowed to chown each
other's files, nor are they allowed to "give away" one
of their files to somebody else.
On unlock the quota gets deducted from the user who
created the hugetlbfs file.
This means there shouldn't be security issues with this
approach.  Let me know if I've overlooked one.
