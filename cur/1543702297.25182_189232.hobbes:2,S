What is your problem?
I'll use a very common and simple case that I do myself: use any USB media 
reader to read a camera card. It will be a FAT filesystem on the first 
partition, so your fstab might look like this:
	/dev/sda1               /mnt/smartmedia         vfat    noauto,user,ro  0 0
and then you just do "mount /mnt/smartmedia", and you're done.
This works. I do it all the time. You just stick in your card, and mount 
it, and off it foes. No "fdisk" or "parted" _anywhere_.
