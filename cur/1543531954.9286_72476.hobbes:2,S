Silly:
	pids - allocate one page to the pid table - tell kernel there
		are an infinite number of pids, but only allocate one page -
		why allocate more, they don't all get used....
	files - don't allocate a file table, do just like above with pids...
BTW, pids are overcommited. Originally they were equivalent to "slot". The
above discription for pids also applies to slots.

To the user porcess it is memory. They are pages of real storage locations.
NOT the same as "names".

It  isn't being treated differently. A sparce file is still limited by
the users disk quota (which measures what is actually used...) When the
user exceeds quota the user is aborted. Just because one user reached quota
limit, is no reason to abort all users of the disk, or even to abort a
random user....
If there are no quotas on disk then the last process that attempts a write
will get aborted - the random process... This is the same as for memory without
quotas.
Disk quotas serve the same purpose that memory quotas do. They provide
for equitibly sharing access while providing security to the space assigned
can be used by the user/process that it was assigned to.
