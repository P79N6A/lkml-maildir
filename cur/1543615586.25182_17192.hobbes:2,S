Hi Andrew,
I tested 2.4.17 bare  and got TLWOH  (total Lockup Within One Hour)
So it is clear (for me at least) that the spinlock protection is _really_
needed.
I applied the 'Patch_for_ted' to 2.4.17 (without difficulty), build a new
kernel and I'm running it now. On 2.4.4 with the patch applied I got
uptime of 108 days when a power outage stopped the box.
regards
Kees
