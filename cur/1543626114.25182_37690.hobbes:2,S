I think we are back in action.  We put all the ssh stuff back.  As well as
the download statistics, take a peek at www.bkbits.net, your stuff should
be there.
Let me know if your project is missing anything, I know about the ppc tree,
we have that data, that's next.  But other than that, everything should be
back, let me know if that is not true.
