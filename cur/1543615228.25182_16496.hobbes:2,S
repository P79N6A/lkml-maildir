In particular, it would probably make sense for the kernel to use 
-ffreestanding (which implies -fno-builtin) throughout then selectively 
enable the built-in functions that are wanted with macros such as
#define strcpy(d, s) __builtin_strcpy((d), (s))
in an appropriate header, then #undef these macros in the files that
shouldn't use the built-in functions.
