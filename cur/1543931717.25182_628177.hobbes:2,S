Some news:
* man-pages now has an (irregularly updated) blog:
      
http://linux-man-pages.blogspot.com/
Repeating some old news:
* man-pages now has a website:
      
http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages
  The site includes HTML versions of the current set of man-pages.
* The list linux-man@vger.kernel.org has been created for
  the purpose of discussing Linux man page bugs, patches,
  and maintenance.  To subscribe, send a message to
  majordomo@vger.kernel.org, with the body:
        subscribe linux-man
Back to the news as usual...
I've released man-pages-2.73.
This release is now available for download at:
    
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/man-pages
    or 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/man-pages
Changes in this release can be seen at
http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/changelog.html#release_2.73
The changes in this release are mainly formatting fixes.  Aside from that,
some work has been done to improve the HTML used for the online pages
(

 ).
Cheers,
Michael
