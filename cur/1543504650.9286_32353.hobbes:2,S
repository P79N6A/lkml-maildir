I have a patch:
    
ftp://ftp.shout.net/pub/users/mec/kbuild/mkdep-2.3.12.patch
This was a genuine bug in mkdep which affected about 10 different .depend
files in the kernel.  Thanks to Keith for isolating a killer example.
Please try this out and let me know if it works, so I can send it
Linuswards.
