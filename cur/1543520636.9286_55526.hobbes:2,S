Hi
I use a raid0 array of two partitions on two SCSI disks, both connected
to a AHA-294X. Since 2.3.32 (I tested up to 2.3.35-6) I get
	Got md request, not good...
when trying to e2fsck the md device, after this the e2fsck process hangs
and is unkillable (or at least ctrl-C nor ctrl-Z does anything), I am
able to reboot cleanly tho!
Is anyone else seeing this or does anyone know what the problem could
be?
SMP, Dual PII, 3 SCSI disks...
At boot time I do
/sbin/mdadd /dev/md0 /dev/sdb3 /dev/sdc3
/sbin/mdrun -p0 /dev/md0
