The most valuable tool of all swsusp developers and testers was and is the
serial console. If there are errors that haven't been found yet by anyone
(and a lot already have been found and fixed!), it's time to dig out the
console cable, record it and report it. That's what happend all the time
in the last year or so.
In all cases, I never could do much with the text on the screen. Apart 
from being hard to paste into emails, it also scrolled away in most cases 
(or worse: everything was just hanging and I had to increase debug level 
which produced even more output that wouldn't fit on screen). By the way - 
higher debug levels disable nice output automatically (AFAIR).

Did I say redirect to serial console or what? ;-)
