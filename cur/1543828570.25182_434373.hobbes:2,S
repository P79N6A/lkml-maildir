Hrm...  That's actually one thing git might do - how hard would it be
to teach git-upload-pack to generate the diffstat and shortlog instead
of a pack?  It has all information needed for that, after all...
I mean, _you_ can ask that sort of summary, but when somebody else
wants to take a look at the summary of some branch in remote repository
mentioned on l-k, well...
If that's too much work server-side, could the result of git-fetch-pack -k
be easily postprocessed client-side to get the same result?  That's
easy to undo - just a single rm would do that...
