Hello,
tried patch on P965 chipset containing 8086:29a0 memory controller.
I got in dmesg:
agpgart: Detected an Intel 965G Chipset.
agpgart: AGP aperture is 256M @ 0x0
is this supposed to be correct?
This warning can be related (0000:01:00.0 is Nvidia NX7600GS graphic).
PCI: Failed to allocate mem resource #6:20000@30000000 for 0000:01:00.0
