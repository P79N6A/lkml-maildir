So far a very good idea and I very much welcome this - it's been long overdue.

Now this is quite bad - we avoid ifdefs where we can.  People will notice
their module won't link if they don't get the dependencies right.
Note that in the case of linux/blktrace_api.h it's really bad as that
header contains a userspace ABI.

This is very nice, but please submit it as a separate patch, before the
actual CONFIG_BLOCK introduction.
Also I'm not sure the try_to_release_page variant is actually right as
we still have that horrible default of try_to_free_buffers() if there's
no releasepage method.

makes sense I think - but this also belongs into the above preparation
patch.

ACK, tiny patch of it's own.

tiny fix on it's own - it's actually a separate buf

Nice, but please make this a separate patch.

separate patch, please.

dito.

separate patch

please do this without all the ifdefs in .c files.

if we already have a duplicate copy of it we should use it all the time.
Maybe there's even a way to avoid this.  please submit it as a broken
out patch so smart people like akpm can help solving this problem without
steeping through this huge patch :)

please split that code out into a do_mounts_block.c like the other special
case root mount code.

please use cond_syscall for them.

I though we agreed to kill the seclvl crap?  We should kill those broken
LSM callouts aswell then.
