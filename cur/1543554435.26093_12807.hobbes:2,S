memory.c:83: bad pmd 0000000000000001
Alpha DP264 UP
2.4.0-test10 (not pre)
I never got a bad pmd before.  I booted test10 on Nov 6, and I've gotten
bad pmd's about once a day (5 so far) since then.  I don't think it's
hardware.  I was running test10preX (circa Oct 24) for a while, and never
got it (and various test1-9 before that), so it has to be something in one
of the later test10pre versions.
It's coming from mm/memory.c:free_one_pmd().
Compiled with gcc 2.95.2 19991024 (release).
