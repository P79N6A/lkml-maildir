I assume you mean "theoretical" that an application would care, not
that it would happen.  (Unless I misunderstand, it is nearly
guaranteed to happen every time an inode is evicted after a
[mac]time update.)
I fear that there are applications that will be harmed by any
spurious change in [mac]time, even if it's not backwards.  Apps that
trigger on any change in mtime may trigger twice for every change.
Eg, I suspect there is some scenario in which an rsync-like
application that supports nanoseconds could suffer (just in
performance, but still).

This would mean that even "legacy" programs that only use second
resolution would be affected, which seems worse.  At least programs
that recognize the nanosecond field are more likely to know about
the issue.
