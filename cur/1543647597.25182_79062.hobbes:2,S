Depends on how fast Linus takes my patches. In the end vty_init will
initialize display drivers that need a other resource that are avaliable
latter (i.e pci handling, irqs) and the other drivers will be called by
vt_console_init. vt_console_init can be called much earlier than now. In
fact I will soon remove the need to call bootmem. I plan to removal all
the console related stuff from the arch directories!!! It can be done with
some work. I done it for the ix86 platform. The need for a dummy console
will also go away.
