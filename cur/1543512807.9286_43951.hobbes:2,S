I think I see where you're going with this.
In some designed systems like ATM, one can subscribe to (or "reserve") re-
sources ($N percent, or $M instructions/sec of CPU time) and it's the job 
of the system to provide (at least) that to you.  
I've never used or studied RT Linux, but if it doesn't provide this guanan-
teed ``quality of service'' (not bandwith, computrons!), it might be a neat 
addition.  Clean implementation might be icky[tm].
