fput(server->sock_file), where sock_file is NULL ... ?

This complaint is about 'server' or 'server->sock_file' being NULL,
probably the sock_file.
I think what happens is that at umount it enters this code:
	if (server->sock_file) {
		smb_proc_disconnect(server);
		smb_dont_catch_keepalive(server);
		fput(server->sock_file);
	}
The problem here is that smb_proc_disconnect may run into trouble if the
connection is gone. And by the messages smbfs is having connection
problems. That will cause smbfs to close the socket and request a new from
smbmount.
A fix would be to simply do the disconnect first, and then test sock_file
again. Or simply make smb_proc_disconnect not do anything if the
connection is bad.
I wonder why this doesn't always crash when the connection is bad.
Can you repeat the oops?

Once it has crashed here, it holds locks preventing anyone from accessing
it.
