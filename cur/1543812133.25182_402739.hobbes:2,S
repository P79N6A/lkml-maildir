There are two cases as far as I can see:
- We have in-driver pending stuff, so we can just retry the operation
  later when some of that completes.
- We are unlucky enough that someone else holds all the resources, we
  have nothing to wait for.
The first case is easy, just punt and retry when some of your io
completes. The last case requires a way to wait on the iommu as you
describe, which the driver needs to do somewhere safe.
