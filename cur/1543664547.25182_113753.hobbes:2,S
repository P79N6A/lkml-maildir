Hmm, psuedo didn't get caught.  Is psuedo code particularly smooth?
Anyway, looking beyond comments only may catch real bugs.
I found this a few days ago whilst looking for commonly
misspelled words, a much weaker technique than your spellchecker.
[steven@spc5 linus-2.5]$ bk export -tplain ../linux
[steven@spc5 linus-2.5]$ cd ../linux
[steven@spc5 linux]$ find . -type f | xargs grep psuedo
./arch/ppc64/kernel/iSeries_IoMmTable.h:/*   allocated the psuedo I/O Address.                                  */
./drivers/base/platform.c: * platform.c - platform 'psuedo' bus for legacy devices
./drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx.seq: * use byte 27 of the SCB as a psuedo-next pointer and to thread a list
./drivers/scsi/g_NCR5380.c: *   Perform a psuedo DMA mode read from an NCR53C400 or equivalent
./drivers/scsi/g_NCR5380.c: *   Perform a psuedo DMA mode read from an NCR53C400 or equivalent
./drivers/video/skeletonfb.c: * no color palettes are supported. Here a psuedo palette is created
./drivers/video/anakinfb.c:     fb_info.psuedo_palette = colreg;
----------------------------------------^^^^^^
This shouldn't even compile.
[steven@spc5 linux]$ find . -name "*.h" | xargs grep pseudo_palette
./drivers/video/i810/i810.h:    u32 pseudo_palette[17];
./include/linux/fb.h:   void *pseudo_palette;                /* Fake palette of 16 colors and
Yep, a mistake all right.  Adding the listed author to the cc list.
