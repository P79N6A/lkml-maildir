Heh, yeah Ingo pointed this style out.  This is a wrapper where the
facility will be supplied by the caller (I assume).  The thought there
was that only complain on printks which had a string literal as their
first arguement.  That gets us very high accuracy and eliminates these
falsies.

I think I tend to agree that the MAKEMASK ones are separate.  Good to
see someone using their common sense in the face of whinging by the tool.
You will be pleased to know that the latest version of the tool is
throwing a new batch of errors on your patch :)  Included at the end of
the email.
