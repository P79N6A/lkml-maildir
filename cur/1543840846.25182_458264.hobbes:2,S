I still haven't had much time to look at the implementation, but this
design seems cleanest I've considered, IMO.
Of course I would really hope we don't need any special casing in the
SMP balancing (which may be the tricky part). However hopefully if
things don't work well in that department, they can be made to by
improving the core code to be more general rather than special casing.
Do you have a better (/another) idea for the design?
