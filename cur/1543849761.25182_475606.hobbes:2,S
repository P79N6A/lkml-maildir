The mount point has permissions that you can set to allow read/write
access to users/groups. You can do that as a mount option or later
with chmod.
spu_create has an argument to specify the permissions for a new
object and follows the regular umask rules.
I also chose to allow users to set permissions on each file in order
to do cross-user IPC, but so far, nobody has used this to my knowledge.
