As Bill said that would block things like "-" and "_" which are fine.
Bill also mentioned something about "breaking configs going back to
2.4.x" which is bogus because nothing broke when we started blocking
"/" and "." and ".." in networking device names during the addition of
sysfs support for net devices.
Nobody in their right mind puts a space in their network device name.
All you "name purists", go rename the block device name that is used
for your root partition to something with a space in it, and watch how
many startup scripts and command line invocations just explode.
There is absolutely no valid argument for allowing spaces in network
device names.
