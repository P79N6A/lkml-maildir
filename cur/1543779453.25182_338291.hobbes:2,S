Yes.  Sorry to leave you so long pondering over my words!

Yes.  The problem case is the one where "maybe_mkwrite" finds !VM_WRITE
and so doesn't set writable (but as Linus has observed, dirty is set).
I'm no expert on that case, was just guessing its use, I think Robin
determined that Roland is the expert on it; but what's very clear is
that it's intentional, allowing strace to write where the user cannot
currently write.

Either you or I.  You'll have to spell that out to me in more detail,
I don't see it that way.
What I do see and am slightly disturbed by, is that do_wp_page on a
shared maywrite but not currently writable area, will go the break
cow route in mainline, and has done so forever; whereas my page_mkwrite
fixes in -mm inadvertently change that to go the the reuse route.
I think my inadvertent change is correct, and the current behaviour
(putting anonymous pages into a shared vma) is surprising, and may
have bad consequences (would at least get the overcommit accounting
wrong).
