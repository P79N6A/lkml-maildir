I'll need to find a system with the required setup; unfortunately I
don't have one myself.
What's required is an Opteron motherboard with both an AMD 8131 PCI-X
bridge and a PCI Express slot (typically Nvidia Nforce4), and an
MSI-capable device (such as a Mellanox HCA) on the PCIe bus.  I know
that eg Tyan makes such a motherboard.  Does anyone reading this have
a setup like that?
