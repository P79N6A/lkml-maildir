Limiting set(re)uid seems like a nice extension, but I think the proposed
mechanism is wrong.
I had an idea, a while back, to change the setuid / setgid semantics a bit
when using ACLs (which are themselves still a future idea...); my idea is
to move the two bits indicating setuid and setgid to *each* entry in the
ACL.  This way, I can set- for each program- not just *who* can use it,
but *what permissions* they'll get when they do.  (In a similar vein, if
we ever add support for forced capability sets to the filesystem, we can
use a similar idea and give varying capabilities to each user).
This also solves the server situation- simply set the set[ug]id bits only
in ACLs, and only for users / groups that aren't restricted.  Then the
more `restricted' users won't see the programs as setuid at all.
