Yes, I compiled from source explicitly for this purpose.
I made a second attempt at getting dir_index to work, with make clean in linux 
and e2fsprogs.
1) I ran 'tune2fs -O dir_index /dev/hda2". So good so far.
2) Upon rebooting in to single user mode, I ran 'man fsck' to figure out how 
to get those nifty progressbars ;)
3) While starting man(1), EXT3 began spewing messages in the form:
"EXT3-fs error (device (ide0(3,2)): ext3_readdir: directory #4243459 contains 
a hole at offset xxxxxx"
The directory number stayed constant, but the offset was variable. fsck -fD 
had -not- been run at this point.
4) On reboot, fsck reported:
"Directory inode has unallocated block #xx"
multiple times. fsck seemed to fully recover the filesystem. I rebooted again 
for good measure.
5) Not set back, I tried 'man fsck' again. It worked as expected this time.
6) Next, I executed 'e2fsck -CfD /dev/hda2". When it completed, I rebooted.
7) While KDE was trying to start, EXT3 dumped the following to the console:
"EXT3-fs error (device ide(3,2)) in start_transaction: Journal has aborted"
8) I rebooted, and fsck said:
"Directory inode 131073,block3,offset 528: Directory corrupted"
I wasn't so lucky this time, and a good portion of my home directory got 
eaten.
9) I tried to start KDE again, and the filesystem went read-only halfway 
through composing an email. I didn't catch the error on the console that 
time.
10) fsck reported more 'Directory corrupted' errors, and more of my home 
directory ended up in /lost+found
11) I ran 'tune2fs -O ^dir_index', rebooted, and fsck cleaned up all the index 
blocks
It seems to be running stable now. Linux 2.4.19, UP Athlon, GCC 3.2.
