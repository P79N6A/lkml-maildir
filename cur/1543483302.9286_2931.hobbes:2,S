Hi,
I am using Linux as a gateway/router for my network via SLIP. But for
some sites, I can only access them if I start my netscape on the
router. If I access them from my network, which goes through my
Linux gateway, my netscape just waits there forever. It seems that
netscape sends some bytes to the remote site and wait for response
from the remote site. For some reason, the response never comes.
Is that possible for the Linux gateway doesn't forward those bytes
sent to the remote site under certain conditions? What should I
look for?
Thanks.
