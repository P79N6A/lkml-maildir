Killing a process in linux with "kill -9 oid" also release all resources, 
such as memory and file descriptors.  The resource consumption of a 
"zombie" is measured in bytes, not kilobytes.

Did you try logging out from the graphical user interface,
and then logging in again?
GUI programs are usually children of the window manager (or some
app launcher, all of these quit when you log out.  A plain
zombie started from the GUI will disappear after that.  
Only something stuck in a device driver will need the reboot,
but that tends to be a bug in the driver.
You can try unloading the driver module, but linux has a
nasty tendency to answer that with an OOPS or worse.  When
something goes wrong - it does so properly and thourougly. :-)

Yes it does - the problem is that not all resources are managed
by processes.  Some allocations are managed by drivers, so a driver
bug can get the device into a unuseable state _and_ tie up the
process(es) that were using the driver at the moment.

Interesting, but you might need a path from "kill" into
every device driver. :-/  And of course it wtill won't work 
if there is a bug in the driver.

Can os9 do this if the process is busy calling into a buggy
device driver that simply doesn't return or perhaps believes
that some dma operation into process memory is taking forever?
Or perhaps os9 doesn't have lots and lots of drivers written by
different people with varying competence? 
Often, the real solution is to fix the driver to deal with
"unexpected" conditions.
