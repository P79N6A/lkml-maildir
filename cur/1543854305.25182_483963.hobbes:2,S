Well, the idea behind the level/edge flow is not exactly that afaik.
It's more like having tailored handlers for level/edge on PICs that are
not intelligent to auto-mask with a priority mecanism (ie. dumb PICs
which are very common in the embedded field, and for example, on ARM
where genirq takes its roots).

In general, PICs that are intelligent enough to mask off, wether using
something as you describe or using priorities. I don't feel the need of
going through hoops to allow lower or same priority interrupts in.
First, if you really need an interrupt to be serviced quick, then you
can just give it a higher priority. In the general case however, I do
-not- want to allow interrupts to stack up. Imagine a big IBM machine
with hundreds interrupt lines, what happens to the kernel stack if we
let them interrupt each other ?

I don't think there is a real need to let lower priority interrupts in
on a CPU that is currently handling a higher priority one.
In the case of RT, though, with delayed delivery, then, the option to
mask and EOI right away is always possible.
