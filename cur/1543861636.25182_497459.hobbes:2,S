I'd second that request. Mirroring out distros isn't the primary
objective of kernel.org, and we should focus on giving the kernel
developers what they need to do their job. Distro mirroring is best
handled by other sites around the world, and by bittorrent. I doubt
anyone out there will notice if kernel.org stops mirroring these
distros, while kernel developpers hopefully will.
