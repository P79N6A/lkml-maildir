Look.  Please.  If you have the time, let's just put it out of its misery.
I had two concerns with smalldevfs:
- It's dropping a semaphore (i_sem?) during its synchronous userspace
  callout.  That was for deadlock avoidance and may have introduced a race.
- The new userspace doesn't support the compatibility names.  Just some
  config file, or a tarball or a dang shell script full of `ln -s'
  calls would fix that up, I think.
