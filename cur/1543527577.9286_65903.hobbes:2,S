I assume that when you say you are loading the tlan module you're in fact
doing: ifconfig eth0 xx.yy.zz.aa, right? or Mandrake is doing this for you.
Ok, could you try this:
Load the tlan module withe speed=100 or speed=10 to force either 10Mps or 
100Mps speed settings. 
If that doesn't help please try out 2.2.15p10 as it has some timer fixes
Are you completely sure syslog hasn't recorded anything?
