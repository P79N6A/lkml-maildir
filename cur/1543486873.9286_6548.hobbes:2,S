Okay, step by step.
1) In order to use 2.2.x, I have to update a plethora of system
utilities.
2) Among them, the ones included in util-linux (including login, passwd
and others).
3) The util-linux README (newest version) says it doesn't support shadow
paswords! (Using /etc/passwd is not acceptable for me.)
4) I could install, over util-linux, the Shadow Password Suite found at
ftp://i17linuxb.ists.pwr.wroc.pl/pub/linux/shadow
but is it safe? There's a July 98 version deemed stable, and a December
98 version deemed "development". None of them ever mentions kernel 2.2
or the newest version of util-linux.
What do I do?
And what's the reasoning behind not supporting shadow passwords in
util-linux?
Thanx 4 listening,
