If this is true, and the driver source is in C, then you've basically
done the job - tweaking it to run under Linux instead of DOS is most
probably the easiest part of the procedure.

   4. Do so FAST so as to keep the data rate up.

| There is something frustrating about the quality and speed of Linux  |
| development, ie., the quality is too high and the speed is too high, |
| in other words, I can implement this XXXX feature, but I bet someone |
| else has already done so and is just about to release their patch.   |
