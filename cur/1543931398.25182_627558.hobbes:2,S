As a matter of fact, since it's "unlikely()" in net_rx_action() anyway,
I wonder what is the main reason or gain of leaving such a tricky
exception, instead of letting drivers to always decide which is the
best moment for napi_complete()? (Or maybe even, in such a case, they
should call some function with this list_move_tail() if it's so
useful?)
