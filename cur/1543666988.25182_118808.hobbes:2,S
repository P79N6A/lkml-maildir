The story behind this machine is that I was building it as cheaply as
possible for my parents, (just to browse the web, and write E-Mail).
I never use pre-assembled hardware, prefering to build my boxes from
scratch, but I broke that rule to save money, and recommended that
they bought a pre-assembled case, motherboard, ram and cpu.
To cut a long story short, the board was jumpered for 100 instead of
133, and when re-jumpered at 133, it crashes during init.
It's being returned tomorrow, and from now on, I build systems from
scratch.  Always.
