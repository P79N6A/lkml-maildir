Subject: PATCH: fix typo in capi driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/9/30/64

I didn't have ISDN builds on in my tree for some reason hence missing these
two from the tidy ups at the end. Marcel Holtmann also came up with the
same fixes although I didnt find that email until I did these.
