i saw heavy scheduling during dbench runs (even if just running 6 threads
on an 8 CPU box), and checked out the source of the scheduling storm -
most of it was due to llseek()'s down().
i also wrote a dbench-alike load simulator for pagecache scalability,
there i saw this in an even more prominent way, 200k/sec reschedules in a
situation when there should be none.
i'd suggest 64-bit update instructions on x86 as well, they do exist.
spinlock only for the truly hopeless cases like SMP boxes composed of
i486's. We really want llseek() to scale ...
