For the last patch yes. Their are to many brain dead programs out their
using the way current fbdev works.

You should not be able to go from pool one to pool 2.

This was just being discussed on linuxconsole. I was told by the standards
you are REQUIRED to have keymaps per VC.

Right.

Thats a matter of patching fbcon.c to make sure.

One I added modedb support. Two the default var and fix are __initdata so
thats deallocted after boot time :)

Because most low end video hardware can't save the current hardware state
in hardware :( Also if you don't save the state of the VT your switching
from you don't know what your state is when you switch back.

If you mean using the console ioctl calls. Well their are prpoblem with
it. In fact a patch will be posted very shortly here to fix many of the VT
emulation bugs. For 2.5.X the console system will be far more complanent
with VT standards.

I don't have source in front of me. If this is the case then the console
system is broken. Console mode stuff should be done via VT ioctl calls. If
you want to find tune your console sthen fine open fbdev and change a few
things. This will change any VTs linked to this vidoe card. Every VT
benifiets.
> > NO MORE ARUGING!!! I think I have made my point.
> Well. 
I reached the point where I don't care. Leave the system as it is. Its to
late to fix it anyways. But this time I learned my leason and I'm going to
start working on 2.5.X the minute 2.4.X is out. By the time 2.5.0 comes
out the code we will develope will be able to be dropped in and it will
be very stable. I was hoping to change fbdev enough so the latering of the
console code wouldn't effect every fbdev driver or every input driver.
Well this is not going to be the case. This means the CVS tree we have
will be big. Oh wells. But as I said I will be ready for 2.5.0 :)
