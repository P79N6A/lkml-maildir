LDT allocated for cloned task!
I'm seeing this message come up fairly often while running vanilla
2.4.2-pre3 on my dual Celeron system.  I don't think I saw it before
while running 2.4.1, but I may have just missed it.
My system has been up around two days and has 11 of these messages in the
ring buffer.
Actually, I just remembered that I'm using the mga DRI driver module
from the DRI CVS tree rather than the built-in module, so that's not part
of the official kernel...maybe that is causing the messages.
