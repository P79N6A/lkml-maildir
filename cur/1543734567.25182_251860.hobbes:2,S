Subject: [PATCH] close race condition in shared memory mapping/unmapping
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hey all-
	Found this the other day poking through the ipc code.  There appears to 
be a race condition in the counter that records how many processes are 
accessing a given shared memory segment.  In most places the shm_nattch 
variable is protected by the shm_ids.sem semaphore, but there are a few 
openings which appear to be able to allow a corruption of this variable 
when run on SMP systems.  I've attached a patch to 2.6.9-rc2 for review. 
  The locking may be a little over-aggressive (I was following examples 
from other points in this file), but I figure better safe than sorry :).
Anywho, here it is.
Thanks
Neil
