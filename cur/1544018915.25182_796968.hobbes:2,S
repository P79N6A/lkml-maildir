Right. There are multiple subsystems that all have the same requirements.

Isnt it possible to defer that (queuing them (sigh)). A bitmap could be
used to avoid queuing and may even allow fully concurrent allocations
without locks. Use a counter to check watermarks once in a while.
Struct page error checking could only be enabled for debugging purposes.

I played around with some bitmap concepts having basically a bit vector
per MAX_ORDER page (plus giving a preferred order to each MAX_ORDER
chunk in order to avoid fragmenation) but I had to abandon that at the
time due to time constraints.
The bitmap / counter approach could get a way with testing/incrementing a
percpu counter and flipping a bit. One of the reasons that I am quite
pushy on the per cpu atomic ops vs. interrupts is that these would allow
a page allocator fastpath w/o disabling interrupts.

Well if the page stays with a refcount of one then we do not need to check
the refcount at all but just push it in an out of some queue / bitmap or
something.
