Subject: RST from NT SP5 when telnetting to linux 2.2.6

The NT machine with SP5 can telnet to some linux machines in our net and not
other ones. I  have at  least two  linux machines it  can't connect  to, and
they're running plain 2.2.6 and 2.2.7 + VA patches.
Here's the plain 2.2.6:
18:15:35.595678 nthell.su.varesearch.com.1111 > rabies.su.varesearch.com.telnet: S 18491720:18491720(0) win 8192 <mss 1460> (DF)
18:15:35.595891 rabies.su.varesearch.com.telnet > nthell.su.varesearch.com.1111: S 2280349338:2280349338(0) ack 18491721 win 32120 <mss 1460> (DF)
18:15:35.597157 nthell.su.varesearch.com.1111 > rabies.su.varesearch.com.telnet: R 18491721:18491721(0) win 0
(it resets here, and starts over, forever)
Here's a successful connection to a 2.2.7+VA patches machine
15:19:04.966956 nthell.su.varesearch.com.1115 > magic.su.varesearch.com.telnet: S 18788504:18788504(0) win 8192 <mss 1460> (DF)
15:19:04.967190 magic.su.varesearch.com.telnet > nthell.su.varesearch.com.1115: S 3961345252:3961345252(0) ack 18788505 win 32120 <mss 1460> (DF)
15:19:04.967342 nthell.su.varesearch.com.1115 > magic.su.varesearch.com.telnet: . ack 1 win 8760 (DF)
15:19:05.004933 magic.su.varesearch.com.telnet > nthell.su.varesearch.com.1115: P 1:13(12) ack 1 win 32120 (DF)
15:19:05.005251 nthell.su.varesearch.com.1115 > magic.su.varesearch.com.telnet: P 1:4(3) ack 13 win 8748 (DF)
Who is to blame here? (well, I'm obviously biased, but I don't know TCP RFCs
well enough to say  if NT has a reason to reset the  connection in the first
trace)
Thanks,
Marc
(Damnit, why did  they have to discontinue the Merced  simulator that ran on
linux, I wouldn't have to bother with those stupid NT machines otherwise :-( )
