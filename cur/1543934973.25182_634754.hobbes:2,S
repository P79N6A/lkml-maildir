Hi Ingo,
I posted a new version of that patch:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/4/197
It's in your inbox with subject:
[PATCH] profile: further Codying Style fixes, take 2
The patch you applied was changing the funtionality in case of
non-SMP build.
This was reported by Sam Ravnborg , see:
http://linux.derkeiler.com/Mailing-Lists/Kernel/2008-01/msg01383.html
Can you please apply the new patch?
