[1.] One line summary of the problem:
 Logitech (and generic) ps/2 mouse not detected
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
 The ps/2 mouse is not detected and does not work with 2.2.12
 kernels. It also doesn't work with 2.2.6. OTOH, it works flawlessly on
 2.0.36.
 The port is on a Abit BX6 II motherboard.
 Nowhere at boot or in the logs is there the "Detected PS/2 Mouse
 Port". This message does appear on 2.0.36.

 mouse, psaux
