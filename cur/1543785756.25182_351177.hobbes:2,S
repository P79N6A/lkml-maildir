And yet thousands and thousands of people, businesses, etc, say that  
the Linux kernel code is miles above all the commercial software out  
there. Please leave the worthless rhetoric out of a technical  
discussion.  The issue stands that in many ways the Reiser4 code does  
not exactly follow Documentation/CodingStyle and does not match most  
of the rest of the kernel, making it hard to read for other kernel  
developers.  If you were just doing this forever as an external  
kernel patch, nobody would give a damn.  On the other hand, you're  
trying to get it included in the upstream kernel, which means that  
those same "other kernel developers" for whom it is hard to read may  
be expected to maintain it until the end of time.  Given this, it  
seems perfectly reasonable to ask that it be cleaned up.

How does XFS have _anything_ to do with Reiser4?  A technical  
discussion is no place for political pissing contest.

That's not his responsibility, it's _yours_.  If you want your stuff  
included in the the kernel, you need to make sure it is sufficiently  
acceptable.  Besides, this is just one complaint of the many he  
made.  This may not be particularly solvable, but there are a number  
of other points he made that you guys need to try to resolve.

See above.  Rhetoric has little or no place here.  Such comments are  
why Reiser4 typically triggers massive flamewars when it is mentioned  
on the LKML.

had the best answer:
"Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems? They do  
it because life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't.  
That's why I draw cartoons. It's my life."
