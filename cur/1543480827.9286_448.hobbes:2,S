Apparently, they CAN be used under Linux in SOME circumstances, but
not in many others - Alan Cox described the situation as "we support
them badly". However, I'd love to know more about this...

That I can understand...
Can I check whether my understanding of the current situation is
correct:
 1. Most (if not all) multi-changers are SCSI? I'm not aware
    of any IDE ones.
 2. If I put a non-multichanger IDE CD drive on /dev/hdd, would
    the normal /dev/hdd1 etc scheme work?
Best wishes from Riley.
