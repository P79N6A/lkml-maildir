one of the reasons 2.5 works better is that it has more than one bdflush
thread (aka pdflush), so it can submit in parallel to all your storages
and you don't risk to hang on writes on the very slow device, despite
your main harddisk could be completely idle. This isn't easily fixable
in 2.4, it's one of the things 2.5 is there for ;)
