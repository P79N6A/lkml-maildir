Hi Pekka,
you know, I'm absolutely agree with you. Hey, kernel hackers don't blame
me ;). But lets just take an example from a real life: I'm asking for
someone to give me 50 cents he would probably give me this. But if I'm
asking someone to give me 0 cents - he''ll give me nothing!!! Nobody
giving me a spec. papper on which "zero cents" is written. :)
So the code
	p = kmalloc(0);
	if (!p) {
		return -ENOMEM;
	}
is absolutely right - we physically have _no_ zero-sized memory. And as result
we have no reason to keep spec. slab to track zero-sized allocs.
Please, don't get me wrong, I'm not a kernel specialist...
And sorry for meddling into coversation.
		Cyrill
