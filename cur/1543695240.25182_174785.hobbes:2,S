Some modules cause problems. If I suspend with the intel-agp driver
loaded, for example, the computer reboots when copying the original
kernel back, because the hardware state doesn't match. I can suspend and
resume my i830 based laptop just fine without it. Once the right changes
are made to the driver, the module will work, but not yet.
Pavel, excuse me for jumping in here.
Regards,
Nigel
