They also, usually, don't need to build customized kernels.  In fact,
I would argue that for *those* people, anything that gets in the way
of dynamic autodetection (plop a new card in your machine, or connect
a new thing to your USB/PCMCIA/FireWire/ADB/SCSI bus, and the machine
should work on the next boot *without* having to go though a
recompilation process) is a major mistake.
