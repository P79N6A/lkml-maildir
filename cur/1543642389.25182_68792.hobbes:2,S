Perhaps this explains my nfs problem. (2.5.32/33 UP, preempt, no
highmem)
Soemtimes, when editing a file on nfs, the file disappears
from the server.  The client believes it is there 
until an umount+mount sequence.  It doesn't happen
for all files, but it is 100% reproducible for those affected.
Editing changes the directory when the editor makes a backup
copy, the old directory is kept around wrongly, and so the
save into the existing file silently fails because
wrong directory information from cache is used?
