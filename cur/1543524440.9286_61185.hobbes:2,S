Ignore the block number: it is only used by the upper layers to find
blocks in the buffer cache.  The rsector is what you want.  If you have
a remapping layer like raid0 or LVM present, the blocknr will refer to
the block on the logical device, but the rsector will always give you an
index onto the real physical device you are going to do IO on (the LVM
remapping will be included in the calculation of rsector).
