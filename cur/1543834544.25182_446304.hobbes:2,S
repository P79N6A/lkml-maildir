Yeh.... this patch is somewhat different to the others, yet similar...
I didn't bother changing ext2_get_inode at all, but just defined a
get_dentry export_op so that bad inode numbers never get to
ext2_get_inode via nfsd.
So in this case I had to test for the upper bound as well as the lower
bound.
Putting it another way,
 ext3_get_dentry reject certain inums that are known to be a problem.
 ext2_get_dentry allows only those inums that could possibly be ok.
So if you (anyone) prefer one approach over the other, making the
change so they both fs take the same approach would be trivial.
Compile tested only

------------------------------------
Have ext2 reject file handles with bad inode numbers early.
This prevents bad inode numbers from triggering errors in
ext2_get_inode.
