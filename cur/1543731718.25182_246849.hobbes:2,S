PROC_MAXPIDS is the size of the buffer used to temporarily store the
pid's while doing user copies, so that potentially blocking operations
may be done to transmit the pid's to userspace.
Introducing another whole-tasklist scan, even if feasible, is probably
not a good idea.

Using a larger, dynamically-allocated buffer may be better. e.g.
allocating a page to buffer pid's with.
A solution to the problem of the quadratic algorithm I wrote long ago
restructured the tasklist as an rbtree so that the position in the
tasklist could be recovered in O(lg(n)) time. Unfortunately, this
increases the write hold time of tasklist_lock.
