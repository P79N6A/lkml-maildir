There are first a couple of older and not so old (Centaur) chips that 
generally stop the TSC in C1.
And also some boxes who shouldn't have anything deeper than C2 have
trouble with the TSC. For example I got a Opteron machine (which
definitely shouldn't have any C2 since it's two socket) where the
TSC appears to stop or at least slow down a lot in C1.
And thirdly it's just unclean to add all kinds of custom hooks
there. It was already ugly in NOHZ, please don't continue that.
