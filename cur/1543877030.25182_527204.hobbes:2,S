Authorship information is very useful in the binary, especially when you
have to get lawyers involved in explaining things to people. Company
business and management people understand
"load it into a binary editor, search for Alan Cox, now call your lawyer"
trying to prove a given source is a given binary is much much harder.

Not if I have anything to do with it. Putting maintainer in is not a bad
idea but that assumes it gets maintained, the beauty of _AUTHOR is that
it's generally right and stays that way or approximately so.
