Glad to be of help.  I hope the /proc/mtrr stuff works out, it is
nice to use _all_ the memory?.  How much is it?
Don't forget the complaint to the vendor.  The only way to get 
permanently rid of this sort of problem is when the vendors get
enough reactions to sloppy bioses.  Don't be silent just because
you found a solution, you shouldn't really have to in this case.
Also check if there is a newer BIOS around. :-)
