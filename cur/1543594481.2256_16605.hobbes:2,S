Your disk has 2116800 sectors of size 512, that is, 1083801600 bytes
(slightly over 1 GB).

Nothing wrong here.

2116800 sectors of size 512 is the same as 1058400 blocks of size 1024.
Nothing is wrong with block 1006290 being mentioned.
Note that hdc1 is a partition on hdc, not all of hdc.

At first sight this is just a rotten disk.
But since this is very close to the end of the disk, you might
investigate some details. (Some ZIP disks can be used as big floppy
and as removable disk, that is, without or with partition table,
and differ a little in size depending on what you do.
Don't know whether something similar could apply in your case.)
Of interest:
(i) the output of dmesg | grep hdc
(ii) the first sector that fails (is it this 2116604?)
