Shouldn't it be all right to schedule the change at the moment of
that call and have it happen later? Resisting a temptation to abuse
keventd and schedule_work and using a tasklet may help with latency
enough to make this tolerable.
I'm sure that a generic mechanism to drive asynchronous usb_control_msg
is going to be required as well for this project. The pl2303 is just
lucky to avoid it.
