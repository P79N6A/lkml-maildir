Hello.
Thank you for pointing out.

Excuse me, but I didn't understand why (4) and (5) are needed.
append_function() {
  down(semaphore_for_write_protect);
  ...
  ptr = head;
  while (ptr->next) ptr = ptr->next;
  ptr->next = new_entry;
  ...
  up(semaphore_for_write_protect);
}
read_function() {
  for (ptr = head; ptr; ptr = ptr->next) {
    ...
  }
}
Are (4) and (5) needed even when (3) is exclusively protected by down() and up() ?
Regards.
