Hmm, in theory you could handle a 64bit signal frame from 32bit code
(just may need an assembly stub if you want the arguments). But it 
would be quite ugly agreed.
Perhaps it should force __USER_CS yes in this case, agreed.
There is a small risk of breaking someone, but it's very small.
I can do that change if you want.
BTW the long term plan is to get rid of the special cases to make
it easierto use the 32bit kernel ABI from a 64bit program.
This means signal handling will likely just check the code segment
at some  point to decide if it should set up 32bit or 64bit frames
and we'll probably do similar things with the other cases 
(except exec which needs to stay this way) 
If you're interested in this I guess that could be done sooner
with some patch submissions (hint hint ;)
