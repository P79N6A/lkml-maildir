This is the controversial part in all it's glory:
	if (!(fc->flags & FUSE_ALLOW_OTHER) && current->fsuid != fc->user_id)
		return -EACCES;
Leaving it out would gain us what exactly?
I'm not trying to say that this is somehow better than the
pam+shared-subtrees solution discuseed.  That certainly has advantages
over this (e.g. suid programs get permission to fuse mounted
filesystems).
But leaving it out makes no sense.  Zero, zilch, none.
Maybe I'm totally dumb, but I just don't get Christoph's argument.
Thanks,
Miklos
