autoconf 2.55's NEWS said:
,----
| - shell functions
| 
|   Shell functions will gradually be introduced, probably starting with
|   Autotest.  If you know machines which are in use that you suspect
|   *not* to support shell functions, please run the test suite of
|   Autoconf 2.55 on it, and report the results to
|   bug-autoconf@gnu.org.
`----
but actually I'm not sure if this was ever done. That's not actually `a
POSIX shell' I suppose, but it's also not going to work on prehistoric
shells like Solaris's 1980-vintage /bin/sh.
