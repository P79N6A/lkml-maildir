Subject: [patch] big IRQ lock removal, 2.5.27-F8
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

the latest irqlock patch, against 2.5.27-BK-current can be found at:
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/remove-irqlock-patches/remove-irqlock-2.5.27-F8
the big change since -F3 is the introduction of a separate preemption,
hardirq and softirq bitrange within preempt_count:
 * PREEMPT_MASK: 0x000000ff
 * HARDIRQ_MASK: 0x0000ff00
 * SOFTIRQ_MASK: 0x00ff0000
 * IRQ_MASK:     0x00ffff00
with this it was possible to have a functional in_irq() again, so the
skbuff.c hack could be reverted.
The definition of the bitrange depends on the following base defines:
 #define NR_PREEMPT      256
 #define NR_HARDIRQ      256
 #define NR_SOFTIRQ      256
NOTE: other, non-x86 architectures might want to define a tighter
bitrange, to make the preempt-only check cheaper. On x86 the above
bitrange is the most optimal.
compiles, boots, works just fine.
Changes in -F8:
 - preempt/hardirq/softirq count separation, cleanups.
 - skbuff.c fix.
 - use irq_count() in scheduler_tick()
Changes in -F3:
 - the entry.S cleanups/speedups by Oleg Nesterov.
 - a rather critical synchronize_irq() bugfix: if a driver frees an 
   interrupt that is still being probed then synchronize_irq() locks up.
   This bug has caused a spurious boot-lockup on one of my testsystems,
   ifconfig would lock up trying to close eth0.
 - remove duplicate definitions from asm-i386/system.h, this fixes 
   compiler warnings.
