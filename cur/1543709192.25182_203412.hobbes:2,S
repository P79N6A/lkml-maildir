Normally, a bigger shm segment = higher performance. Throwing the TLB
away means lower performance. Depending on the workload, the tradeoff
could work out either way ... the only thing I've seen so far from
someone who has measured it was hints that 4/4 was faster in some 
situations ... we're trying to do some more runs to confirm / deny that.
Hopefully others will do the same ;-)
