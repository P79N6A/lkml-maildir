Ok. so you think /proc/mounts can be extended easily without breaking
any userspace commands?
well lets see..
1. to disambiguate bind mounts, we have to add a field that displays the
	 path to the mount's root dentry from the filesystem's root
	 dentry. Agree?
2. For filesystems that do not have a backing store, it becomes hard
	to disambiguate bind mounts in (1). So we need to add a
	filesystem-id field.
3. if we need to add the propagation status of the mount we need a
	 propagation flag added in the output.
4. To be able to construct the propagation tree, we need a way to refer
	to the other mounts, since some mounts are peers and some other
	mounts are master. Which means we need a mount-id field.
	Agree?
If you agree to the above 4 new fields, it becomes challenging to
extend /proc/mounts to incorporate these new fields without
breaking any existing applications.

With the addition of the above 4 mentioned fields, I think one should be
easily able to decipher which mnt-id is mounted on which mnt-id. no?
maybe not. Well we will have to extend the mountpoint field to indicate
the mnt-id in which the mountpoint resides.
