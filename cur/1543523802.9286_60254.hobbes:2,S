hi all,
since weeks I'm unable to create a bootable boot/root-floppy - the latest
versions (also pre-patch-4) are resulting in an "Oops" just before loading the
root-image.
My question is:
has anybody on this mailing-list created a bootable boot/root-floppy or
is this just impossible with this kernel-version?
(booting from hd works fine)
regards
ralf
