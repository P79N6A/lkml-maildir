No sweat, I'm not. - BTW, anyone know since when it is again/when it
will be "safe" (as in not corrupting the fs) to use dump on a mounted
but idle fs? - I could use lvm snapshots as well, last I heard there
was some "bug" in the buffer cache corrupting data when dump was used
even on an ro, but mounted, fs.
So long,
