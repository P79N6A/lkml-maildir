This 'sort' of thing would be a good idea for 2.5 IMHO (pref. asap), mainly 
to get it out of the way! It would probably be a good idea to do this on a 
tree just before it matures too (eg: when 2.5 migrates to 2.6/3.0/whatever).
The savings to other trees are probably not worth the effort involved for 
what we gain back (at the moment anyway).
You'll probably find that there are other things about that might save a 
few bytes here and there too (and at the same time might clean the code up 
a bit and make it more readable).
