What is problem? CONFIG_M386 + CONFIG_MATH_EMULATION still runs
everywhere (but maybe only on single CPU). CONFIG_M386 +
CONFIG_MATH_EMULATION + CONFIG_SMP should be able to run anywhere in
reasonabl efficient way, but I may be overlooking something obvious. I
never ran SMP.
[Fortunately, _all_ users know how many processors they have and 486
SMP machines are really rare and non-Intel SMP machines are not
available, so CONFIG_SMP + CONFIG_M586 should do the trick if you can
rely on people telling you how many processors they have.]
