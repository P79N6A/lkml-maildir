Actually there are widely used 3.3 variants that support unit-at-a-time
(e.g. 3.3-hammer which was shipped by several distributions for some time)
There are still a lot of systems around which use gcc 3.3 (less so with
3.4). Unless there's a major bug that is hard to work around I would
prefer to keep it supported.
Bogus warnings should be relatively harmless.

The unit-at-a-time output order is not defined, so even if it works
with the current compiler a compiler change might still trigger
that problem. So it would be better to fix those anyways.
