seems like I was running late with my patch to handle the LCD properly
after blanking the screen.
We definitely need the patch below to get the LCD's backlight to a sane
state after unblanking. Otherwise, it is disabled unconditionally,
because the LCD is turned of literally in the registers during blank.
Reading those again on unblank will simply not reactivate the LCD, yet
DPMS was handled properly, leading me to wrong conclusions.
This adds a new variable to struct neo_par for storing a boolean whether
to read the register values next time we (un)blank. For some reason it
was not sufficient to check against !blank_mode while reading registers
in the beginning of neofb_blank().
Reworked patch against neofb.c having
neofb-avoid-resetting-display-config-on-unblank.patch applied.
