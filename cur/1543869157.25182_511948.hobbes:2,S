Ah, and you have fb_splash too.  That's why the tracing was not what I
expected it to be.
Try using video=vesafb:noblank to disable hardware blanking and find out
if you can still reproduce the oops.

After grepping for change_console, all callers of change_console and
complete_change_console are acquiring the console semaphore, so I really
don't know what's going on here...
Since you are using a non-vanilla kernel, can you just do
a grep change_console of the kernel source and see if you can find a
caller that missed doing an acquire_console_sem().
