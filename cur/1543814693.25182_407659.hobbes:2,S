I did something like that before, by changing acpi_evaluate_integer()
to return 3000 if it is asked for _TMP.

The alternative, obvious change in thermal.c (diff below) turns out
not to be a minimal change.  If acpi_thermal_get_temperature() returns
with a failure, then most of the later methods in THM0 aren't
executed, so one is actually commenting out much more than _TMP.
Which is why I think the minimal change is the diff above to utils.c.
With that change the system never hung.
Or should I do a compromise modification, where calls from thermal.c
to _TMP use the hacked acpi_evaluate_integer()
[e.g. acpi_evaluate_integer_called_from_thermal()], but other calls to
_TMP get the unhacked version?
Here is the diff for commenting out _TMP directly in thermal.c, which
I think I've tried already but I'll try it again.  I'm sure it'll
work, though.
