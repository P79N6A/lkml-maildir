But if there aren't any consistency constraints on the memory, why not
get it with kmalloc().  There are two approaches to handling DMA on a
not-fully-consistent machine:
	1) Allocate the memory specially so that it is consistent
	2) Use any old memory, and make sure we have explicit cache
frobbing.
We have to have both: some hardware requires approach (1), and the
structure of the kernel often requires (2) to avoid lots of copying
(e.g. a network device doesn't allocate its own skbs to transmit, so
it can't assume the memory has any special consistency properties).
Since in case (2), we can't make assumptions about where the memory
came from, it might as well come from kmalloc() (or a slab, or
get_free_pages() or whatever).
