I'd in fact expect quite a few people to have a FreeBSD partition around. 
And MINIX if they are in university and in an operating systems course...
But "they should take whatever precautions they want themselves" is a valid 
argument.

I'll for now stop updating the partbackup thingy as posted. Given that Linux 
  only follows the first extended in the list of extendeds (which sort of 
destroys the nice recursion anyway) it might want to be iterative instead of 
recursive if the thing has a future -- not very important though.

Oh come on, that's going overboard a bit, it's not all _that_ bad! Finding 
say "sda" will be possible without breaking too many times. Admittedly, the 
kernel's partittion scanning order is also not likely to change as it would 
certainly break userspace, but code duplication, with the possiblity of bugs 
slipping in at least userspace-ways (considering the kernel the reference no 
matter what it does) is a concern. Somewhat. A little.

Not to mention my Grand Visions of a totally new Linux native partitioning 
scheme probably modelled after BSD slices (as also mentioned in a previous 
message just now). Or perhaps LVM already fills that role comfortably. It's 
certainly what I hear everyone talking about these days.
