I am not sure if it's a good idea to push items on the stack.
Remember we are moving to 4K stacks.

This is a cause of concern, we cannot afford to have incorrect data
collected. Incorrect/unreliable data which is worthless.

Yes, thats true right now, but I am not sure if we should go optimize
that so early. We could end up adding other accounting/extending the
framework, we'll need to add the flags back then.

BTW, you should be clearing the flag here.
Overall, the lock removal is not acceptable. I don't like the bit
hacking for flags and moving counters to the stack either.
