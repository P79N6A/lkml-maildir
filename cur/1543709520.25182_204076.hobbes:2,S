Disconnect the hardware device.  Oh, you don't have a PCI hotplug
system, well get one :)
Seriously, sure, try to unload the module.  But please refer to all of
the different threads on lkml during the 2.5 development cycle about
module unloading.  Also note the way that module unloading might be done
in 2.7 (by keeping the old memory around, and never freeing it...)
Also realize that it's better to fix the driver in a situation like you
mention.  Unloading the driver is often times not a viable solution for
a lot of people (like if your scsi driver is also the one holding your
root disk...)
thanks,
