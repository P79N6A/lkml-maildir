Yes, that's what I meant.  Would you test it on your disks and, if it
works, repost to LSML with your Signed-off-by line?
(See linux/Documentation/SubmittingPatches.)
Or write it as
 	if (start)
 		cmd[4] |= 1;	/* START */
+
+	if (sdp->type == TYPE_RBC)
+		cmd[4] |= start ? 1 << 4 : 3 << 4;	/* POWER CONDITION */
Alas the test for TYPE_RBC is not ideal.  As I wrote in my other mail,
there are some SBP-2 disks which pose as TYPE_DISK.  It's not a big
problem though because almost all of them also work with POWER
CONDITION = 0.  The only exception is DViCO Momobay CX-1 which goes
belly-up POWER CONDITION = 0 and START = 0.  Maybe I should simply
overwrite the CX-1's sdp->type by TYPE_RBC.  I suspect that this is what
it implements anyway.  The firmwares of the later Momobay models FX-3A
and IIRC CX-2 do so.
