Exactness and neatness in moderation is a virtue, but carried to extremes narrows the mind.

The greatest braggarts are usually the biggest cowards.There is nothing a man of good sense dreads in a wife so much as her having more sense than himself.
A short absence is the safest.When a true genius appears in this world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.
True courage is not the brutal force of vulgar heroes. Rather the firm resolve of virtue and reason.The illegal we do immediately. The unconstitutional takes a little longer.
