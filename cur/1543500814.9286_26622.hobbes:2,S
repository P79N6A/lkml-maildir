I would be skeptical this could work because such a motherboard would
probably not have a BIOS that would be compatible the K7 that could boot
anything.
I'd bet the console program in ROM on any Alpha motherboards would be tied
very closely to the Alpha architecture.
The linux kernel still needs a BIOS to boot.
Of course if the booting problem could be overcome, then maybe things
could work.
