Speaking of cxgb3, could you explain what the hell is
static int do_term(struct t3cdev *dev, struct sk_buff *skb)
{
        unsigned int hwtid = ntohl(skb->priority) >> 8 & 0xfffff;
doing?  AFAIK, skb->priority is not net-endian...
Another odd place is
int t3_seeprom_write(struct adapter *adapter, u32 addr, u32 data)
{   
        u16 val;
        int attempts = EEPROM_MAX_POLL;
        unsigned int base = adapter->params.pci.vpd_cap_addr;
        if ((addr >= EEPROMSIZE && addr != EEPROM_STAT_ADDR) || (addr & 3))   
                return -EINVAL;
        pci_write_config_dword(adapter->pdev, base + PCI_VPD_DATA,
                               cpu_to_le32(data));
with callers like
int t3_seeprom_wp(struct adapter *adapter, int enable)
{
        return t3_seeprom_write(adapter, EEPROM_STAT_ADDR, enable ? 0xc : 0);
IOW, you really get little-endian values passed to pci_write_config_dword()
and it expects a host-endian as the last argument...
