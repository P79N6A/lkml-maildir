Subject: poor system response after "nice'ing" a compute-bound process to 19

hi-
 I've got a compute-bound process (ok, its setiathome..) running on a
350mhz K6 under 2.2.14.  In an attempt to recover some use of the
machine i've reniced the process to 19.  System response,
mouse-movement, window-redraws are still very, very sluggish.  
 Is this just the way it is?  Even though a process has been niced to
19, does it still run its entire timeslice even though higher priority
processes are eligible to run?
 A buddy nextdoor with an old (slower) HP unix machine gets much better
system response with his setiathome niced to 19.
 just curious if this is the way its supposed to be-
Thanks
ron
