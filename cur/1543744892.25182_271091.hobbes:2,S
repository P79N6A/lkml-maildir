I think shared queues are actually quite fundamentally broken at the
moment (as pointed out to me by Al). It stems from the refcounting /
conceptual relationship between a gendisk and a queue (I think - been
a while since I looked at the code).
I had something which just about fixed it up except that I couldn't
work out an appropriate place and name for the "queue" in the sysfs
hierarcy (IIRC I just had it as a sequentially increasing number, in
/sys/block/).
It is a relationship that I don't think sysfs can capture very well:
queues are shared between multiple other objects, but they have no
meaning outside the context of one of these objects.
