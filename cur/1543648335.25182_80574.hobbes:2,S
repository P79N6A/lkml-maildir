Hello all
I'm working with a new Dell Poweredge 4600 Server with Dual CPUs.  However,
Linux reports that it sees 4 CPUs...  I have opened the thing to see if Dell
gave me 2 extras for free, but no luck:  Attached is /proc/cpuinfo.
I've tried the RedHat 8.0 stock kernel, as well as a freshly compiled 2.4.19
but both exhibit the same behavior.
The specifics on the machine:
Dual Xeon 2.2 GHz CPUs (512 k L2 cache)
2 Gigs DDR RAM
The chipset is a ServerWorks CMIC-HE (see attached lspci for complete
listing).
Has anyone else seen this behavior?  The only other SMP machine I have is an
older Dell server with Dual 1 GHz coppermines, and it reports 2 CPUs...
Any information or advice is greatly appreciated...
Thanks in Advance,
Mark
