Hi All,
After including some of the versioning header files and some macros like
MODVERSIONS, I am still unable to load the module into the kernel.
Now the printk(), kmalloc() problems are solved, now only left out 
is unresolved symbol is register_chrdev_Rsmp_904e3677 but ksyms has 
register_chrdev_Rsmp_e337b494
Please let me know where I am making mistake...
Thanks in Adv
Vishwanath
