WHY it SHOULD change mening ? Even with multihead you STILL have ONLY one
"current" virtual console for every program.

There are NO things like /dev/ttyX in devfs. If there are more then one device
there are directory for that devices (/dev/tts/* for serial ports,
/dev/printer/* for line printer ports, etc). You can not use /dev/tty/* and
/dev/tty at the same time. So what yoy proposing as /dev/ttyX will be
in some subdirectory and there are will be "0" for "current" head as well.
What's wrong here ?
