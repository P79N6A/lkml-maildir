I forgot to mention that I used attention button to test hot-plug.  As 
mentioned in an earlier thread, I found problem in using CLI to do
powering-up and getting status when using acpiphp in my system.
I think the problem with getting the slot status and setting led status 
is that these information is hardware specific and there is no standard
ACPI method that the driver can call to do so. That may be the reason 
there is a acpiphp_ibm extension.
Does anyone use CLI successfully in their systems with acpiphp?
Thanks,
Dely
