A couple of very low risk items dropped in my mailbox today so seeing as
you've not replied about 2.2.12pre7 as a 2.2.12 final I've done an update.
(2.2.12pre8). It fixes some documentation items for the ESS Solo sound
card, updates the megaraid driver to the one AMI now ship and fixes a small
table leak in the masquerade as well as a compile failure for a weird
ipvs option combination
If you read this after you release 2.2.12 final no big deal.
