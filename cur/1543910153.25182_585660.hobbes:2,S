Well, the rtc-ds1742 platform driver uses a string "ds1742" for its
platform_driver definition.
static struct platform_driver ds1742_rtc_driver = {
	.probe		= ds1742_rtc_probe,
	.remove		= __devexit_p(ds1742_rtc_remove),
	.driver		= {
		.name	= "ds1742",
		.owner	= THIS_MODULE,
	},
};
We can change the name string and all definitions of "ds1742" platform
device instead of adding MODULE_ALIAS.  It is easy since there are
only a few users in kernel.  If that was preferred, I can rewrite this
patch.
