kiril, 
I am guessing that you want to avoid a custom kernel
in order that your programs shall be portable.
So, I am having a hard time understanding why putting
the command line args into a file instead of on the
command line, in a way similar to grep and many other
programs:
"fgrep -F patternfile"
would not answer the case.
Is there any absolute need to have so many args passed
to exec from the command line?
