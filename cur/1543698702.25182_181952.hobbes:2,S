I'm not so sure about that. If Linus and a few core developers decide to 
explicitly state that you can't use the Linux kernel with binary only 
modules than you can't.  They have the right under copyright to restrict 
the usage of their contributions - if this means that they say "you can't 
use our contributions to the kernel with any binary only ring 0 code" - 
then you can't.  And it is totally irrelevant whether your work is derived 
or not.  They can't force you to release your work as GPL - but they can 
forbid you to utilise the linux kernel with non-GPL'ed work - which in the 
end is quite close.
Or am I totally wrong here?
Cheers,
MaZe.
