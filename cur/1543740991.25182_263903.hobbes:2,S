Yes, it does.
Moreover, 2.6.10-rc1 has this problem too, but here the network adapter 
stopped working along with the USB (as you can see above, it shares an IRQ 
with the USB too).  Also, this time I was able to reload the ohci-hcd module 
(it didn't help) and I got these messages:

The "control timeout on ep0out" and "Unlink after no-IRQ?" messages are 
puzzling, but the last one is just ridiculous as the box has _nothing_ to do 
with Intel.
