The assumption is the page is already up to date and we are writing
the whole page unless EOF lands inside the page. AFAICT, we can't
get called with a page that is not uptodate and so page filling is
not something we should be doing (or want to be doing) here. All we
want to do is to be able to change the mapping from a read to a
write mapping (e.g. a read mapping of a hole needs to be changed on
write) and do the relevant space reservation/allocation and buffer
mapping needed for this change.

We already have them - ioctl(XFS_IOC_UNRESVSP) and
madvise(MADV_REMOVE) - and another - fallocate(FA_DEALLOCATE) - is
on it's way. Racing with truncates should already be handled by the
truncate code (i.e. partial page truncation does the zero filling).
/me makes note to implement ->truncate_range() in XFS for MADV_REMOVE.
Cheers,
Dave.
