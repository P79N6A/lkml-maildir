The usual solution for 2 modules that share an archive would be to create
*three* modules driver-a, driver-b, and driver-core - and then have the
appropriate depmod magic so a 'modprobe driver-a' does an insmode driver-core,
as does a 'modprobe driver-b'.
Otherwise, you're just loading the entire library into memory twice,
once for each driver...
