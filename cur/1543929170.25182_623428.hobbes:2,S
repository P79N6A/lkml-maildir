They can be used safely. You just have to pick one and stay with
it. (And no, no-clobber hack does not help here. Or do you have
specific application where no-clobber hack helps?)
Anyway, with wildcarded dates, no-clobber is a problem -- because you
need to kill the alarm after you waken up, or it will repeat.
