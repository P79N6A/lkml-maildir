   Thanks for that snippet; it's much more complete than the last one I found.  
I especially like the handling of const- and volatile-taking callback fns.  
My version is uglier, pasted below.
   There are three problems I see here.  First, the lack of warning for "void 
intfn(int); DECLARE_TIMER(t, intfn, 0);", but that's relatively minor.  
Second, the change of all the users is just churn, with cast_if_type() it can 
be done over the next couple of years, if ever.
   Worst, I can't see a way to apply your technique in general, for 
non-void-returning functions (eg. interrupt handlers).
Here's the typesafe_cb () helper function from ccan (there are also 
typesafe_cb_preargs and postargs for callbacks with extra args):
/* Doesn't handle const volatile, but can be added. */
#define typesafe_cb(rettype, fn, arg)					\
	cast_if_type(cast_if_type(cast_if_type((fn),			\
					       rettype (*)(const typeof(arg)), \
					       rettype (*)(void *)),	\
				  rettype (*)(volatile typeof(arg)),	\
				  rettype (*)(void *)),			\
		     rettype (*)(typeof(arg)),				\
		     rettype (*)(void *))

That's fine, happens to all of us.  I was a little disappointed to return from 
holiday to discover that either your work or mine hadn't been merged tho :)
Cheers,
Rusty.
