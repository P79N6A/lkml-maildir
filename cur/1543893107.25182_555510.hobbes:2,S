How about racy with respect to normal open or fork+exec from another  
thread?  Specifically there are cases where libc or other libraries  
want to create a backend thread dealing with file descriptors in  
response to the program's straightforward calls into that library  
(Examples include using syslets or event-based polling threads).
SCENARIO 1:
Program Thread:   Library Thread:
                   fd = socket(AF_*, SOCK_*, 0);
fork();
                   int x = FD_CLOEXEC;
                   fcntl(fd, F_SETFD, &x);
New Process:
setgroups(...);
seteuid(...);
exec(....);
Whoops!!! Suddenly the user process executed by the (theoretically)  
single-threaded program got a handle to a netlink socket affecting  
some system resource!!!
SCENARIO 2:
Program Thread:     Async libc getpwent()-cache syslet
close(0);
                     fd = open("/etc/shadow");
open("/dev/null");
code_which_insecurely_reads_from_stdin();
Here we were trying to safely call into code which reads from stdin  
and shouldn't be given privileged data, but the syslet makes the  
common paradigm 'close(0); open("/dev/null");' horribly insecure.
If you extend all the FD syscalls to all take a "flags" parameter and  
add the appropriate flags, then you can pass O_CLOEXEC|O_RANDFD to  
whatever syscall you are using and both problems vanish.
Cheers,
