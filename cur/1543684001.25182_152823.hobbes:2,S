To borrow from the medical community: "First, do no harm."
There is harm in having blanking enabled during the boot
sequence as well as later.  There is very little harm in no
screen blanking at all.  There is no harm in deferring the
entablement of screen blanking until some time in the RC
scripts where it can be prevented by those who know better.
There is no need for auto-blanking to be a boot parameter if
it defaults to off.  Boot parameters are the least optimal
treatment of this issue.
The common case of which you speak is the least optimised
environment you're likely to find.
