Hello,
I was running standard Redhat 5.2 (linux kernel v2.0.36).
I could run mutt with no problems (/var/spool/mail is nfs mounted).
I tried running the 2.2.1 kernel, and mutt gave
me the following error:
fcntl: No locks available (errno = 37)
I included nfs in the kernel...
I beleive mutt uses fcntl to lock files.
Could someone please explain to me what I might be doing
wrong, or even better, has nfs changed between 2.0.36 and 2.2.1?
Another question:
Is there something else that I need to do to run a 2.2.1 kernel
on a Redhat 5.2 install?
Thanks,
Jeff Mangewala
