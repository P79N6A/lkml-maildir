Just some food for thought:
If you split it into a enable/disable (0/1) attribute, and a level attribute
(some sort of integer scale, or "min", "medium", "max" if you must use
strings.  You could use four levels to mimic the PCI device power state, for
example), it might make its usage more generic, and easier from userspace,
as it decouples the need to turn it on/off from the need to know which level
the user wants it set to when you turn it on.
