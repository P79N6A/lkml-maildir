Hmm. Pavel Machek could hardly be described as a newbie at hacking
stuff, and yet he says, "I hunted bug for few hours, thinking that
kernel does not get the event at all."
The printks are certainly clearer than cat'ing some binary garbage to

recompile kernel and reboot just to discover that the damn thing
doesn't work.
