I'm sure you are protecting access to the queues appropriately?

Irk... You are effectively killing plugging of the floppy driver with
this approach. You do realise that when your replacement request_fn is
called, there are probably more than one request on the queue?

If it's quick, then it's _probably_ there. The problem is, you'll
basically have to iterate all buffers in the request and do get_bh on
them prior to submitting to the original floppy request_fn, then
afterwards wait on completion (out of your own request_fn context). You
should probably off load that to a dedicated thread. And then do
processing on a make_request_fn basis instead so you only have to deal
with single buffer_heads at the time, ie replace floppy blk_dev
make_request_fn with your own that does the encryption on write and
stacks a new buffer head on top of the other for READ, defining your own
b_end_io function for that to decrypt on READ end I/O.
Any particular reason your not using the loop device and just writing
your own crypt plugin??

You are probably walking right into the queue head and using that as a
request, boom.
