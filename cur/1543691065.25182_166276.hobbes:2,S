/proc/cpuinfo says:
model name:   Celeron (Coppermine)
So my configuration for the first 5 main menu items that are enabled in 
makeconfig are:
* Prompt for developer and/or incomplete code/drivers
  * Select only drivers expected to compile cleanly
  * Select only drivers that don't need compile-time external firmware
* Support for paging of anonymous memory
   * System V IPC
   * BSD Process Accounting
   * Sysctl support
* Subarchitecture Type (PC-compatible)
* Processor family (Pentium-II/Celeron(pre-Coppermine))
* Preemptible Kernel
* Machine Check Exception
* /dev/cpu/microcode
* /dev/cpu/*/msr
* /dev/cpu/*/cpuid
* BIOS Enhanced Disk Drive calls determine boot disk
* Power Management support
   *Full ACPI Support (minus the ASUS Laptop Extras and Toshiba Laptop 
Extras)
Do you see anything in that list which I should look into ditching first?
Thanks
