Well, the depmod(8), lsmod(8), insmod(8), modprobe(8), modules.dep(5),
depmod.old(8) and modprobe.conf(5) man pages all have various bits of
info.
There's also some info in chapter 2 of "Linux Device Drivers, Third
Edition" - 
http://lwn.net/images/pdf/LDD3/ch02.pdf
Then there's The Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide -
http://www.tldp.org/LDP/lkmpg/2.6/html/
As well as the Linux Loadable Kernel Module HOWTO -
http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Module-HOWTO/
Also take a look at the file Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt in your
kernel source dir.
That's just a little bit of reading material for you :)
