A fix for that is available from my patches page. I haven't
managed to break the patch on my own machine, but I don't
know for sure if it will work good on all other machines.
Please grab the patch from my page and try to break it. If
nobody manages to really break it in bad ways Alan can
include the fix in 2.2.15pre8...
