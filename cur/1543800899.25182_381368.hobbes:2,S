sorry, I thought the other way around: it would be annoying
to get each mail twice...
I just found a mailing list "discuss@x86-64.org". Would it be
better to turn over there, instead of polluting linux.kernel
by this?

I'm about to understand whats going on. So should I use the
dma patch INSTEAD of "swiotlb=force"? I'll try that tonight.

I may test it again, but all seemed to work without any patch or
swiotlb settings when running without the SKGE network driver.
So, how does this work, if my PCI bridge generally fails above 4G?
Problems arise not until I enable/use the network driver.
Does the dma-patch disable DMA for all PCI devices or only
for those which cause problems (like my SKGE)?
Dieter.
