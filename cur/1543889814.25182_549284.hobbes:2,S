Note: I'm actually much more interested in applying the scheduler changes 
than the paravirt-ops changes. It looks like CFS is getting stable, I'd 
much rather have Ingo working on making a nice CFS patch on top of 2.6.22 
(and the current -git tree should obviously approximate that, I don't 
expect any real changes to scheduler stuff), and merge that immediately 
after 2.6.22 is out. 
Ingo: to make things easier, the _best_ split-up would be not "this is the 
historical series of patches leading up to CFS v15" or something like 
that, but it would be nice to get that final CFS version as a series of 
patches that do some specific things rather than as one final one. Is 
there any possibility that could happen?
