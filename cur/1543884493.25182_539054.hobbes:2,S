Jeremy,
	FYI, we are currently closing on a new system call so that
glibc's fallocate() will be able to call into the appropriate
per-filesystem routines in a portable way, since ext4 will have
persistent preallocation support.
	I think we mostly have consensus on a calling convention which
all of the architectures (s390, power, arm, ia64, etc.); of course
then we will need to get glibc to support the new system call.
