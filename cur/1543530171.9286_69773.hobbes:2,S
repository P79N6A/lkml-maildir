Alan,
Did they never send you a USB drive to test with?
Would you try contacting them again?
Andre, 
Would it help if I loaned you my ORB drive?
Any pointers on getting USB storage set up would be
greatly appreciated.  Currently, I really don't know
where to start.  I have looked at the 
linux/Documentation/usb files, but I don't see anything 
about USB-connected disks and fstab entries.
