One of the features of the Debian / Ubuntu initramfs infrastructure,
which sounds remarkably like your design (or vice-versa), is that it
drops all the "standard" drivers into the initramfs.
This is, to me, worth several minutes of additional boot time, in terms
of flexibility: being able to modify the hardware and be confident that
the appropriate drivers are in place already makes life much, much
easier.
(In practice I doubt this adds more than a second or five to boot time;
 certainly, it takes no longer to get to rootfs mounted than the RHEL 4
 systems that have nothing but what is essential in the initrd...)
So, it would certainly be my hope — with my systems administration hat
on — that your proposed system would support that similar operation as
an option, at least.
Personally, I think it makes the right default: better correct than
fast, but obviously tastes vary there.
