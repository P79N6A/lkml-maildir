That's why I use a `proposed' directory that only contains patches that can be
applied to your tree, in this case it was:
	
ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/proposed/v2.2/2.2.18pre2/VM-global-2.2.18pre2-6.bz2
(note: the above is outdated so it's not anymore suggested for inclusion of
course)
I sumbitted most of the not-feature-oriented stuff at pre2 time and I plan to
re-submit after 2.2.18 is released.
