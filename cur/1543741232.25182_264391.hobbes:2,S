Hi,
I'm experiencing problems with a Maxtor USB HD drives that hope someone 
on this list can shed some light on. When I try to copy a file to or 
from the HD that is > 100MB the whole system hangs. I can't ping it from 
another systems, nothing shows up in any logs so I don't know why it 
hangs. I'm using 2.6.8-k7-smp from Debian unstable. The USB card is a 
2.0 version with a Nec chipset.
Regards,
Johan
