   Not having swap or RAM for every page of mmap()ed data means that you
are overcommitting memory. If you're mmap()ing a file, then that file can
count as swap too. Files with "holes" in them may be a problem.

   Yes, really. Maybe I should have said "additional lost work" instead of
just "lost work". Without overcommit, program crashes will only happen due
software bugs or hardware problems. Lost work will only happen due to user
errors, software bugs or hardware problems. If you overcommit memory, you
can lose the file you were editing in emacs simply because someone sent you
an email and the MTA needed a bit of memory to deliver it to you. Some
people, myself included, just don't find that acceptable at all.
