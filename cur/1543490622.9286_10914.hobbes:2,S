Not new bh, but new irq. When this function is called irq is already
acked, unmasked and cpu is ready to accept new one. The only protection
is __cli() made by handle_IRQ_event() before exit. __sti() before
run_bottom_halves() breaks it, but we are protected by {soft|hard}irq_locks,
so that only one level of nesting is allowed: it is not good too,
but still acceptable. This function cannot leave interrupts
enabled after it releases irq locks, otherwise recursion will be infinite.
Actually, __cli() is misplaced a bit, better place is immediately
before hardirq_unlock().
> A __cli() in schedule() will be for sure a nono.
It is not very essential, because spin_lock_irq(&runqueue_lock)
will disable them in any case. Probably, __sti() would be useful
before spin_lock(&scheduler_lock). But outside of do_bottom_half.

When it occurs, then box just reboots instantly or in the worst case,
bottom of task struct corrupted, and kernel decays randomly, but fastly.
I saw task->sig and task->mm corruption. task->files is the next candidate.
