A crash occurs. 
You just have to be careful, kernel programming is something very different
from user mode programming. If your algorithms are too complex
consider moving them into user space.

Because the kernel stack is per process/thread, and the unuswappable
overhead per process must be minimized. 2.0 has only 4k on i386.
Note that you can't use the full 4k/7k, because you have to leave 
some room for interrupts and bottom halves.
