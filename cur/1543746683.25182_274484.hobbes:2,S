It is a proprietary driver developed for access to passive and active 
modules inside a vme-rack. Active modules can communicate with each 
other over an IP layer created by the driver on top of the VME 
architecture (dual port ram, Tundra Universe II PCI-VME Bridge) and on 
the other hand a device for communication between active and passive 
modules. I don't know if I may make the source code public, 'cos it is 
property of my employer. I have to communicate this. I know there is 
something called GPL and I also know what it means, but I fear my 
oppinion won't be heard by my employer. Well... it's worth a try.
