I have now compiled vanilla 2.4.21 with the same configuration (but 
without the netfilter patch-o-matic patches, which shouldn't matter) - 
it works. But now I'm again stuck without the CLE266 module. Attached is 
the script that does the actual root fs switch (it is called from init 
after the daemons have been stopped, i.e. during runlevel change). I 
hope I haven't done anything too stupid in this script, embarassing 
myself with this post to LKML... ;)
If you want, I could send you a diff of the two trees (between my 
patched 2.4.21 and 2.4.21-ac4 trees). But it will mostly be just your 
own -ac4 patch, with preempt and patch-o-matic stuff applied.
Would it help if I tried it with 2.4.22pre7 ?
