What do you think of something like the following patch?  If we do
this, I don't think we'd need to force pnpacpi=off or change the
way PNP reserves resources.
I'll be on vacation until about January 2, so I won't be able to
do much with this until then.
[patch] it87: request only Environment Controller ports
The IT8705F and related parts are Super I/O controllers that contain
many separate devices.
Some BIOSes describe IT8705F I/O port usage under a motherboard device
(PNP0C02) with overlapping regions, e.g., 0x290-0x29f and 0x290-0x294.
The it87 driver supports only the Environment Controller, which requires
only two ISA ports, but it used to request an eight-port range.  If that
range exceeds a range reported by the BIOS, as 0x290-0x297 would, the
request fails, and the it87 driver cannot claim the device.
This patch makes the it87 driver request only the two ports used for the
Environment Controller device.
Systems where this problem has been reported:
    Gigabyte GA-K8N Ultra 9
    Gigabyte M56S-S3
    Gigabyte GA-965G-DS3

    The patch above increases the number of PNP port resources we support.
    Prior to this patch, we ignored some port resources, which masked the
    it87 problem.
