Noone knows how many thousand bug reports have never reached lkml 
since majordomo silently dropped them.
This is the price for having lkml relatively spam-free.

What exactly is the problem with attaching files?
What is "it didn't even get through the first time" exactly?

If you already lack patience at this point, would you be willing to

Send _one_ email to lkml and you'll get forever spam to this address.
With one email addresses of mine exactly that happened.

If the bug ends at Other/Other that's not a problem - this usually gets
