Linux/m68k 2.4.x runs on some platforms. Also note that Linux/m68k is not 100%
merged with Linus/Alan yet. The mac-specific patches in the m68k tree that
weren't merged are on hold until all issues are sorted out[*], cfr. the
linux-m68k list.
Note to Wakko: feel free to join the project! As usual, we can use the
manpower!!

[*] This includes, but is not limited to:
      - reports that they work
      - reports that they work after applying patch foo
      - drivers shared with the PPC folks must be sorted out with them first

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
