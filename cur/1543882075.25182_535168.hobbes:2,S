They are all known points that have been discussed to death.

But what do you mean with it? A block is no longer a contiguous section of 
memory. So you have redefined the term.

This is not sgi specific sorry.

And you dont care about Mel's work on that level?

No this has been tried before and does not work. Why should we loose the 
capability to work with 4k pages just because there is some data that 
has to be thrown around in quantity? I'd like to have flexibility here.
The fragmentation problem is solvable and we already have a solution in 
mm. So I do not really see a problem there?
