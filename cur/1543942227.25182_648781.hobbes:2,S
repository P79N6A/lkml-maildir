I don't believe there is any way to do that.  Not 100% sure though.
We actually have an I2C M41T81 with battery backed ram to be our main
watchdog so that we can identify when a watchdog trigger occoured on the
system.  Most watchdogs do not provide any state information to the
system after a reset unfortunately.
