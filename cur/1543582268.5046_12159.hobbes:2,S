Yes I was running reiserfs before 2.2.1 and I switched to 2.2.1 a couple 
months ago.  Since then I've been dealing with issues.  I've had to 
recompile half a dozen things similar to sendmail, apache etc.  They 
segfaulted.  It wasn't as purely backward compatible as expected.
I typically compile everything on one machine and distribute it.  Thus 
far everything has been ok save a few issues I haven't been able to pin 
down.  One of these issues is the inability to compile mozilla.  Also 
related, I can't recompile gcc 2.95.2.
All of these things I was able to do just fine before the changeover.  
To note, I used to cvs up mozilla and recompile it every few days.  I 
suppose I'll build an ext2 system and try things out.
Oh btw, I don't run That distribution either.
