I'm paying close attention, but that's kind of the problem people have, 
memory pressure gets high and the processes don't run. I thought of 
"swap out two to swap in one" as a way to dribble the rss down, but I 
doubt it's a magic solution. Swap kills, so does not swap and no memory. 
Obvious solution is to make the rss limit hard and keep it small, I 
don't think that's the answer.
