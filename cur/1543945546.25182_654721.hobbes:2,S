In the longer term, we should look into keeping commands enqueued in
fw-sbp2 during the reconnect phase.
Plus we need full parallelism of sbp2_reconnect and sbp2_login between
all attached targets.  The current single-threaded scheme does not work
too well for more than one target attached to the same bus.  The old
stack handles that case in a single thread too but is better tuned to
sbp2's needs.  The old stack blocks the Scsi_Hosts earlier, guaranteedly
performs all reconnects and re-logins before any new login, and has a
small delay between self-ID-complete and reconnect.  I looked into
changing fw-sbp2's own workqueue delays and into adding a counter to
fw-sbp2 to track outstanding reconnects in order to defer new logins,
but it is too messy.
