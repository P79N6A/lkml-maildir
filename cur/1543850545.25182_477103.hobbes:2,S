Intel systems (except for some large highend systems) have synchronized TSCs. 
Only exception so far seems to be a few systems that are 
overclocked/overvolted and running outside their specification. 
When you do that you'e on your own and we're not interested in a bug
report.
There was also one BIOS found that had this problem, but it was old and rare
and got fixed with a upgrade.
