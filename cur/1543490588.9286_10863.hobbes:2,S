The serial board I was using is probably a special case.  I doubt too many
other people are going to see the same problem.

In my experience "college educated" doesn't in any way imply "computer
literate" *grin*
If it's distribution related, then I'm not going to be much help. I'm not
a redhat user (Debian "potato").
Looking a little closer at the logs:
"Receive serial link is not 8-bit clean
 Problem: all had bit 7 set to 0"
You could try looking at the recieved packets during negotiation ("kdebug
2" in the pppd options) to see what's being sent back and forth once chat
quits and pppd starts.  Your isp might not be ready (although I don't know
why going to an older kernel would fix that).

Like I said, I expect the problem I had to be rare.  The UART detection
that I was talking about is done by the kernel, well before setserial
(rc.serial) comes in.  The file I was talking about was a kernel source
file, not a script, but if dmesg shows correct detection, then it won't
help anyway.
Emir: what was the line you changed?  Maybe Karl's problem is related.
Anyway, this is drifting off topic.  Followups to private email.
Later,
Ray
