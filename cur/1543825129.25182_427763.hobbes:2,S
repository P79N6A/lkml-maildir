Could you please also try if the problems persist if you boot with
init=/bin/bash?
Besides, it would be helpful if you were able to get a serial console log
from the failing system.

There are lots of patches between 2.6.16-rc* and 2.6.17-rc1, most of them
having stayed in -mm for some time.  If you found the first failing -mm kernel,
it would be easier to catch the offending patch.
BTW, have you tried any kernel _after_ 2.6.17-rc1?  If not, I'd start from
these.
