Maybe everyone would be more happy if this "completely different API"  
would live at lower priviledge level, e.g. ring 1, so it could not  
screw up kernel internals? Is this technically possible? Maybe it's  
the same thing, but another way could be to run NDIS stuff inside a  
xen-like virtual environment... Has anyone tried yet?
