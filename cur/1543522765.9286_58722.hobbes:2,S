Subject: static int's for proc_change_penalty and tlb_flush_penalty

I was thinking about making the penalties in goodness() for processor
change and TLB flushes into static int's and putting them into /proc
for ppl to be able to "tune" their SMP scheduler (and to find out with
some user feedback if there are more appropriate defaults for them,
or whether it should really be settable per-system) but realized that
even as a pair of static int's, the misses of that cache line may be
adverse enough to ruin any chance of this being a worth-while change,
so I wanted to get your opinion on this.
Since these are just scheduling policy changes, atomicity WRT the int's
shouldn't matter (although the /proc change function should keep some
reasonable bounds)
Thoughts?
