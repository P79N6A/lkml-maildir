How about preventing the rest of threads from doing mmap()/munmap()/etc.
while the dump is taken? How about thread A coredumping, half of the image
being already written and thread B (nowhere near the kernel mode, mind
you) changing the data both in the area that is already dumped and area
the still isn't? After that you can look at the dump and notice absolutely
corrupted data structures - very effective in misdirecting your attempts
to figure out what went wrong.
