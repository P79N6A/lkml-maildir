Hi,
Looks like, since [1] was merged, a blanked console
(due to inactivity for example) doesn't get unblanked
anymore when new output is written to it.
This hunk of the already metioned patch, which
modifies vt_console_print() in drivers/char/vt.c, is
possibly the cause:

 	set_cursor(vc);
 
-	if (!oops_in_progress)
-		poke_blanked_console();
-
 quit:
 	clear_bit(0, &printing);
 }
Is that new behaviour intentional?
The old behaviour looks more interesting to me,
allowing one to see console messages immediately even
if the console was blanked after some idle time.
Cheers,
Albert
