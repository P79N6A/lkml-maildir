OK :) Here is a graph I made a while ago. It is on a 32 way ppc64 box
running dbench.
http://samba.org/~anton/linux/dcache/summary.png
rat - radix-tree pagecache patch
dcache - RCU dcache patch
ext2 - rusty's BKL removal from ext2 patch
Not surprisingly the RCU dcache patch gave a large improvement in
dbench. While dbench may not be the greatest of benchmarks I am also
seeing a lot of dcache_lock contention on large zero copy workloads (eg 8
way specweb).

I thought tridge put it into cvs somewhere, I'll find out the details
from him.
