True but if the GPL allows, nobody could prevent their fork becoming
the heart of a DRM-locked product, either.
I wonder whether the FSF shouldn't fork the GPLv3 into two versions,
according to what philosophy GPLv2 users would like to adopt for their
own projects :)  (In principle, only the FSF is able to alter the
license of a many-authored GPL'd project like Linux.  It would be
unfortunate if they used that special status to promote an agenda
which a large number existing GPL users disliked).
