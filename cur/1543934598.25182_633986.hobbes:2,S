Subject: [PATCH] [0/8] GB pages (PDP1GB) support for the kernel direct mapping
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patchkit implement GB pages support for AMD Fam10h CPUs. This patchkit only
implements it for the kernel direct mapping for now; support for hugetlbfs is upcomming.
This allows to map the kernel direct mapping using 1GB TLBs instead of 2MB 
TLBs and get hopefully less TLB misses for the kernel.
The GB pages are only implemented for 64bit (because the CPU only implements
them for long mode) and also only for data pages (because Fam10h doesn't have GB ITLBs
and AMD recommends against running code in them) 
There is an option to turn them off (direct_gbpages=off), although I hope that
won't be needed.
Also includes one generic bug fix for clear_page_kernel.
