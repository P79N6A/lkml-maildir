You don't need hardware contexts. You also dont need hardware clipping
if you are running X11 in an 'ok you can scribble on the screen if you
are a dork' mode. Thats no change. I could open the root window anyway
and XSecurity won't be allowing direct video access.

Garbage. Almost all modern video cards don't have magic oh look Im
root features. And I dont care _what_ you do with an ET4000, it'll
