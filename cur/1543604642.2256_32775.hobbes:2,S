we're balancing memory synchronously because we need to recycle some
memory for ourself in order to succeed the allocation. Now if we succeed
in freeing some page we keep this page for ourself while we free the
next pages. So we work for ourself and not for somebody else. With the
"goto rebalance" this isn't required anymore to avoid failing
allocations, but still it should be good to provide better fariness, to
avoid somebody stuck freeing memory hard, and all other tasks eating the
free ram that such innocent task is producing in a starved loop.
