Exactly.  That's what dual-licensing is.

This is no different from the fact that we have some drivers that are
GPLv2/BSD licensed. Within the kernel, they are GPLv2. But on their own, 
you can choose to use them under the BSD license, make your changes to
them, and release them commercially.
And correct - I cannot (and neither can anybody else) then accept those
*non*GPLv2 changes back.

That's from Linus and quite recently.
FWIW, it's damn hard to codify "... and changes to this code should not
change the situation".  It's certainly a very good policy and in this
case it's the only sane policy.

Actually, normally I *do* have such a trust. It's why I have no problem
with drivers that are dual-GPL/BSD, and in fact, I've told people that I
don't want them to turn them into GPL-only, because that is simply not   
polite.

Same posting from Linus.  And that's much more relevant to shooting the patch
in question down (and IMO it ought to be shot down) than references to
legality.
