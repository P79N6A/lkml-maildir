For me it's SMART related.
smartctl -data -o on /dev/sda reliably gets a similar message.
Justin - does this smartctl command trigger a message for you?
I've been mailing on and off since January-ish.
(http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-ide&w=2&r=7&s=libpata&q=b)
Back in March I was running 2.6.16 (with a different version of Mark's
opcode patch) and I sent an email with the following info:
dmesg:
ata1: translated op=0x28 cmd=0x25 ATA stat/err 0x51/04 to SCSI
SK/ASC/ASCQ 0xb/00/00
ata1: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
ata1: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
Does that help with the diagnosis?
Also see my emails: SMART on SATA reporting errors?

I did reply but got no response so I assumed I was just so far off base
that I was being ignored  :)
