that's the very old exploit that touches 1 page per pmd.

if you can't use a sane design it's not a kernel issue.  this is bad
userspace code seeking like crazy on disk too, working around it with a
kernel feature sounds worthless. If algorithms have no locality at all,
and they spread 1 page per pmd that's their problem.
the easiest way to waste ram with bad code is to add this in the first
line of the main of a program:
	p = malloc(1G)
	bzero(p, 1G)
you don't need 1 page per pmd to waste ram. Should we also write a
kernel feature that checks if the page is zero and drops it so the above
won't swap etc..?
If you can come up with a real life example where the 1 page per pmd
scattered over 1T of address space (we're talking about the file here of
course, the on disk representation of the data) is the very best design
possible ever (without any concept of locality at all) and it speeds up
things of orders of magnitude not to have any locality at all,
especially for the huge seeking it will generate no matter what the
pagetable side is, you will then change my mind about it.
