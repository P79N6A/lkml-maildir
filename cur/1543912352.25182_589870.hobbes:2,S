glibc does nothing but call the code in the vdso.  We have a function
pointer variable which either has the old vsyscall value or the address
of the function in the vdso.  Everything else is identical.  Unless the
interface of the vdso function is different (which it shouldn't) I don't
think you can blame glibc.
