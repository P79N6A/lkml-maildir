Hi,
   I am trying to profile the linux kernel. I booted the kernel with
"profile=2" command line option and I am reading the /proc/profile using
the readprofile command. The result I couldn't quite understand the
result I got. The result shows that the kernel is spending a lot of time
the machine_retstart function. One would normally think that the machine
restart function is only invoked once.
The kernel version I am using is 2.4.9-21 on an i386 platform.
Any help in understanding the issue is appreciated.
Thanks,
Venkata.
