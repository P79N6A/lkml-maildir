In this case I gave a very hasty definition of the term, though it does fit 
very well.

Agreed. But those *aren't* "Sheeple".

I never accused any specific person of either. I was making an observation 
about the general nature of humanity as I've observed it. A better definition 
of "Sheeple" would be "Someone who continually parrots some "trusted" figures 
opinion even when presented with proof that that opinion is in error. They 
also, generally, do not "think deeply" on any topic."
And while I won't apologize to anyone that may have felt the "Sheeple" remark 
was directed at them, I will apologize for not taking more time to choose a 
better definition for the term originally.

Dialup is like pissing through a pipette. Slow and excruciatingly painful.
