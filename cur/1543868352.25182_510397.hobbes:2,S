My understanding is that, in the device driver model, devices _declare_
resources, and it's up to the drivers to actually request the ones they
wish to use. Looking at /proc/ioports, this hierarchy is quite visible.
And while not all platform drivers actually request their device's
resource, quite a few do (I counted 95 out of 228), so I'm definitely
not the only one thinking it is the right thing to do.
If the intent was that devices request the resources and the drivers
don't have to care, then a driver requesting a device's resource should
be returned an error. Instead, it works fine, which make me confident
that I got the idea right.

You mean that you wouldn't trust the rest of the platform driver core,
which lives in the same source file, to do the right thing? That's
being too defensive IMHO, and I don't think we usually do that. Greg?
