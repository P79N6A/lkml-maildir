I think this is probably my best bet, however I noticed this in the arp
manpage:
              NOTE: As of kernel 2.2.0 it is no  longer  possible
              to set an ARP entry for an entire subnet.
and as far as I can tell, that means i *do* have to put in ~250 entries :/
Hopefully this removed for a good reason as it looks to cause a big
headache.
