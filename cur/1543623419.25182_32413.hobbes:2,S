SGI's CpuMemSets is supposed to do that as well. We are now able to bind a
process to a set of memories, and soon we will be able to specify how
strict the allocation can be. Right now, if a process is allowed to
allocate memory from node 0, 2, and 3, it won't look outside of this set.
The memory set granularity is smaller though, because it depends on the
process, and the cpu (and thus the node) this process is running on.
The CpuMemSets have been tested and are available on the Linux Scalability
Effort sourceforge page, if you want to give it a try...
