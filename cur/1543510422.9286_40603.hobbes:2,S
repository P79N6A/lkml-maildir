Running "setterm -blank 0" on any VC (or in the bootscripts) to disable
the console screen-blanker can also be very useful to catch any kernel
messages (like eg. "Out of kernel memory" or similar) that were output 
before the machine freezes.  I've had several such freezes where the
kernel was in such a state the screensaver wouldn't unblank, so it looks
like the machine crashed with a blank screen. Disabling the screensaver
enabled me to see what the kernel output before it died, and helped me
submit a bug report.
