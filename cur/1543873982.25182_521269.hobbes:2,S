One day I might understand what pgrp, sessions, and all that stuff is.

I think it follows naturally.
Note that more than the scheduler needs to be taught about this.  The 
page cache and swapper should prevent a user from swapping out too many 
of another user's pages when there is contention for memory; there 
should be per-user quotas for network and disk bandwidth, etc.  Until 
then people who want true multiuser with untrusted users will be forced 
to use ugly hacks like virtualization.  Fortunately it seems the 
container people are addressing at least a part of this.
