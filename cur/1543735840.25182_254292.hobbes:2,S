Hello,
I intend to implement /proc interface for a SCSI HBA.
The proc_info() entry-point in Scsi_Host_Template 
structure automatically takes care of creating a 
proc-dir for each host [HBA] as in :
/proc/scsi/<mydriver>/<HBAnumber>.
I have been able to implement the above stage. Now, I 
am interested in having separate proc-folders for each
SCSI target detected as in :
/proc/scsi/<mydriver>/<HBAnumber1>/<target1>
/proc/scsi/<mydriver>/<HBAnumber1>/<target2>
/proc/scsi/<mydriver>/<HBAnumber1>/<target3> ....
Under each of the target-folders, I would like to
print
relevant information specific to each target.
How do I go about achieving the above objective ? Some
clarifications/insights would be gratifying.
- Thank you
- Shobhit
