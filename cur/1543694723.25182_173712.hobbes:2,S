You know, I remember the days of arj, zoo, arc, lha, lzw, the big switchover
from pkzip 1.x to pkzip 2.x, and about 8 zillion others...  And I must say
that the depth of my lack of caring truly cannot be expressed in words.
As soon as I have to start seeing a lot of blah.tar.upx files on ftp sites,
and the tools for dealing with them come with my Linux distribution, then
maybe I'll start caring.  Until then, no.  I'm interested in bzip because
A) it reliably compresses smaller than gzip by margin big enough to care
about, B) it's in widespread use.
You're talking about something that compresses _less_ well than bzip, but
does it faster.  We have one, it's called gzip.
Ville Herva sent me this table yesterday:

So you're talking about something that compresses LESS well than gzip.  Why?
(I'm told the UPX numbers include a self-extraction decompressor, and the
gzip numbers don't.  The self-extractor would have to be 33k for this to
bring it _even_ with gzip.  And no, gzip -9 does not add anything to
decompression time, only compression time.  I ported info-zip to java 1.0
just before java 1.1 came out with deflate as part of the standard API, I
know how deflate/inflate works pretty well.  I could make deflate work in
place pretty easily.  I can make bunzip work in-place if you'd like (the
symbols occur sequentially, just stick the compressed data at the end of
a buffer the size of the decompressed data, and by the time you're
overwriting any given symbol you must already have read it).  Although bzip
would still need 2-4 megabytes of scratch space to undo the burrows-wheeler
transform, and gzip only needs something like a 64k dictionary.  And doing
either in-place assumes you know the size of the decoded data ahead of
time, but storing the size in 4k pages means 2 bytes gets you a 256
megabyte capacity, which is plenty for the kernel.  (No, I'm not bothering
to overwrite the decompressor.  You can execute that out of flash, why copy
it to dram at all?)
So why should anyone care about UPX?  (Is there really a situation where
gzip isn't fast enough anymore?)  I'm curious why more than one person has
brought it up.  Am I missing something...?

(P.S.  I don't remember info-zip having as much cruft in its deflate
implementation as bzip did, but I intend to do a cleaning pass over
busybox's gzip/gunzip when I get around to it, and I'd be happy to
port the improvements (if any) to the linux kernel afterwards.)
