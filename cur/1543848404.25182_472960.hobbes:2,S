I encountered a similar problem (to a far lower scale) when putting
gitweb on my poor parisc server behind my ADSL line. The machine used
to OOM several times a week. So I've set up an haproxy instance in
front of it with a limit on the number of concurrent connections per
backend. All excess connections are queued and served as soon as one
slot frees up. The machine has never crashed since. Would you be
interested in some help in trying to set it up ? Assuming that epoll
is available, I have absolutely no worries about the load. As an added
benefit, it could also provide HA and LB but I understand it's not the
main concern right now.
