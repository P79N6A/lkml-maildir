Ok, so if you read the standard carefully you get a bogus result. 
Question: Was it meant this way, or did someone just make a mistake
(which happened to slip through and get approved into the standard)? 
I happen to think the second. 
- Is it desirable to have a write-open of a device on a read-only 
fail? I don't think so. You can't open the initial console etc etc. 
- Is it desirable to have access (W_OK) and "open-for-write" return
different results? I don't think so. 
- Are there other systems that adhere to the standard as written?
