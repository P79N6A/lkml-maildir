Hmm...Good idea!  I was going to suggest something like this after seeing
that streaming out large amounts of data to a file ended up toasting all
toastable memory pages on the system.
I'm confused as to how this actually works, though...
Above, in buffer.c:
	int too_many = (nr_buffers * bdf_prm.b_un.nfract/100);
Meaning that too_many is set to the percentage of all buffers currently
allocated (defaults to 40%, correct?).
Your proposed change:
>	if (nr_buffers_type[BUF_DIRTY] > 3 * too_many)
Would check to see if the dirty buffer list has more buffers than three
times the number of too_many, which is already 40% of the total (?).  
Isn't this going to be an impossible case, as the condition in the default
case would be checking for there being over 120% of the buffers dirty?
I'm pretty sure I'm missing something, but I can't see anything obvious.
