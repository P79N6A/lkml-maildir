Heikki,
Those are the same problems I had with my Abit BP-6 SMP-board. There are a
couple of patched which seem to make the problem disappear. The jury is still
not out on whether they really solve the problem or merely hide it, but I
haven't had a crash ever since I patched my box. The most recent patch is the
one from Maciej, you can find it on the list, or in the archives (like this
one: 
http://boudicca.tux.org/hypermail/linux-kernel/this-week/0469.html
 - this
link is only valid 'till sunday!)
Unfortunately, the archives often mangle patches, so it is better to get them
directly from the list (or mail Maciej for it...)
Cheers//Frank
