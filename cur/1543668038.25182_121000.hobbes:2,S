It would really help, if you would explain how a larger dev_t will work 
during 2.6.
Let's take an example, the first user is likely the scsi layer, so how 
can I manage thousands of disks under 2.6?
How are these disks registered and how will the dev_t number look like?
How will the user know about these numbers?
Who creates these device entries (user or daemon)?
How have user space utilities to be changed, which know about dev_t (e.g. 
ls or fdisk)?
How is backward compatibility done, so that I can still boot a 2.4 kernel?
bye, Roman
