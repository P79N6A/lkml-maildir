VM_IO is the way to mark mmapped I/O devices. 
	vma->vm_flags |= VM_IO;
should be sufficient here.
hm, I'm trying to decrypt how the driver accesses the hardware.  It's
taking copies of kernel virtual addresses based off hpet_virt_address, but
there are no readl's or writel's in there.  Is the actual device access
done over in time_hpet.c?
