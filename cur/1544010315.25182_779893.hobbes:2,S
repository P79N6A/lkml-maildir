I'm not sure just warning would be enough. If this happens, its a severe
bug in kmemleak and the tool is no longer useful (it could even leak
memory or free already freed blocks). I could change it to a
memleak_panic call but if the object use_count isn't reliable, the
memleak_disable call wouldn't work properly either.

Yes, indeed. That omission was caused by s/panic/memleak_panic/

Yes, I'll unify these via the memleak_panic() macro.

Yes.

See my comment above, these are genuine kmemleak bugs and it shouldn't
just warn. Hopefully they will never happen unless a get/put_object is
missing.
Thanks.
