Hi
I understand using these macros cleans up codes as I used them in my previous
version.
In the previous version, I used SetPagePrivate()/ClearPagePrivate()/PagePrivate().
But these are "atomic" operation and looks very slow.
This is why I doesn't used these macros in this version.
My previous version, which used set_bit/test_bit/clear_bit, shows very bad performance
on my test, and I replaced it.
If I made a mistake on measuring the performance and set_bit/test_bit/clear_bit
is faster than what I think, I'd like to replace them.
