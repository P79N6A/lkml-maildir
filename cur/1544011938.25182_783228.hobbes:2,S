Yes, I'm fine with it. Two things though:
- Could you please resend the non-mfd parts (patch 4,5,6 and 7) to me ?
- I see from the lkml archives that patches 5 and 6 didnt get Acked yet. I'll
queue them, but I'd really like to get Anton and Dmitry approval before
sending them upstream.
Cheers,
Samuel.
