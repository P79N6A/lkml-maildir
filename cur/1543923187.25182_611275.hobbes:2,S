I agree. The problem is that Dell's DMI tables are not defined in the 
SMBIOS standard. Thus getting the parameters required for the backlight
control (io port, io code, location) needs to be dealt with specifically.
Plus DMI is not as comprehensively supported as ACPI is under Linux.
I think reading Dell's tables to find out backlight parameters in
kernelspace is possible. Unfortunately it would require a significant
amount of brand new code to be written. And i'm not sure it is worth
the effort. Libsmbios is big and complex because it is written in
proficient C++ with lots of OO abstraction. It is also portable. But
the task accomplished is simple in principle.
