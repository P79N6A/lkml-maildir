No. Remember that DMA works differently under SCSI than it does under 
IDE. SCSI DMA is a host controller feature, whereas under IDE it is 
enabled/disabled at the drive level and the drives have special 
knowledge of DMA. Since generic_scsi_suspend() is the device level 
suspend routine, it is called before the host controller's suspend 
routine, (due to depth first traversal of device tree), which is 
responsible for disabling the PCI slot. Only after the host controller 
is suspended will there be no DMA, but if your real question is "can I 
generically control a SCSI disk with PIO for software suspend" then the 
answer is NO. For purposes of not suspending the drivers, I haven't 
looked into how swsusp would see which host adapter owns which drive, 
but some of the required information seems to be present in sysfs.
Now, I don't know how disabling DMA is supposed to behave under SATA. 
There may be something extra we have to do that isn't really standard 
SCSI... SATA is a weird beast and if somebody is using libata it seems 
it might not be possible to use PIO, since enhanced mode might have to 
be enabled at the BIOS. But I don't know this stuff, ask jgarzik.

Does it depend on IDE PIO for some reason? Perhaps related to writing 
out a consistent memory image? I'm not sure if I'm motivated to do 
anything about that ;)
