Hi
One of problems that may be affecting us is the method used to burn. 
Is the fact that some CD-writers don't know how to to Disk at Once, and can 
only do Track at once. What I noticed, is that some versions of kernel or 
possibly hardware (such as mine Phillips CD-writer) seem to work correctly if 
you do tasks in a certain order such don't request atip info and then attempt 
to write the data as Disk at once that fails, and then write it track at 
once. but if I do Track at once the first it fails, note i have not really 
done the extensive testing of this. Just my observations, do it in the wrong 
order, the cd-writer locks up and only responds to power down. Which is verry 
fustrating, and also possibly creates a nice shiny coaster. 
I have read that Disk at Once mode works for writers that understand that 
mode of writing, but the track at once is the one that is currently broken, 
that explains why some us are complaining and others say that all is fine.
