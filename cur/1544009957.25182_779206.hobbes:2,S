I see.  So we can't just set the pci devices to D0 to cut power to the USB
ports and USB controller while in STR?  Must be the EC stuff I just noticed
in the ACPI AML, then.

Thanks for the update.

Hmm, probably it is just suspend, then (outside of STR.  On STR, it *is*
somehow powering down the ports when no wake devices are there, but that
might be done using extra stuff, and not just the PCI functions of the Intel
ICH6 EHCI/UHCI controllers).
I guess our userspace is not doing the suspend on "safely remove" then?
Because at least here, it is not behaving as Windows does when I tell KDE to
"safely eject" (which probably ends up being a HAL request of some sort).
