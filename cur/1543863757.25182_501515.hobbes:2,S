I don't understand, where does the symlink currently point to?  It looks
correct to me on my machines:
$ tree /sys/class/sound/
/sys/class/sound/
|-- card0 -> ../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1b.0/card0
|-- controlC0 -> ../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1b.0/card0/controlC0
|-- pcmC0D0c -> ../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1b.0/card0/pcmC0D0c
|-- pcmC0D0p -> ../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1b.0/card0/pcmC0D0p
|-- pcmC0D2c -> ../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1b.0/card0/pcmC0D2c
|-- pcmC0D6c -> ../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1b.0/card0/pcmC0D6c
|-- pcmC0D6p -> ../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1b.0/card0/pcmC0D6p
`-- timer -> ../../devices/virtual/sound/timer
What do the symlinks look on your machine?
thanks,
