But regular users don't tend to pull down new scsi or ata drivers in the same 
way that they do graphics drivers.  Hence the concern of many drm developers 
to avoid introducing new failure modes in this process.
People who'd never dream of upgrading their kernel have acquired the habit of 
pulling down up-to-date video drivers on a weekly or monthly basis.  So, for 
sanity's sake, the DRI/DRM has been in the business of minimizing exposed 
interfaces, and for my money, should continue to be in that business.
