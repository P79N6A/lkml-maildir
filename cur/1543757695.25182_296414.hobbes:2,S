I found out some interesting things tonight.  I removed my /var and
/home snapshots, and all the corruption, with the exception of files I
had changed while /var and /home were in their corrupted state, had
disappeared!
I overwrote several files on /var that were corrupt with clean copies
from my backups, and verified that they were OK.  I then created a new
/var snapshot, mounted it, only to find out that the files on that
snapshot were still corrupt, but the files under the real /var were
still in good shape.  I umounted, lvremoved, lvcreated, and mounted
the /var snapshot, and saw the same results.  Even after removing the
snapshot, rebooting, and recreating the snapshot I saw the same thing
(real /var had correct file, snapshot /var had corrupt file).
Do you think my volume group has simply become corrupt and will need
to be recreated, or do you guys think this is a bug in dm-snapshot? 
If so, please let me know what I can do to help you guys debug this.
Thanks,
Alex
