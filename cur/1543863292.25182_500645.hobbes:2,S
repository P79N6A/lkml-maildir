The error was reported to me second hand.  I'm expecting a reproducer (although
to date, I'm still waiting for it, so I may have jumped the gun here).  In fact,
I see what your saying now, down in the assembly glue for our arches (x86 in
this case) we jump to do_notify_resume since we have a pending signal, and
inside do_signal from there we fix up ERESTARTNOHAND to be something sane for
userspace.  Ok, I withdraw this patch.  I'll repost when/if I get my hands on
the reproducer and see that something is actually slipping through.
