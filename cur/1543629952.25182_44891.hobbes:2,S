Timeouts may be a bad idea: imagine large (LARGE) database
which you don't want to repair due to lost data over NFS.
Better let it hang in NFS i/o even for hours while you are
repairing your network.
OTOH, interruptible NFS mounts are ok: processes can be killed but
with explicit admin action only, just what I need.
Anybody uses _uninterruptible_ NFS mounts? Enlighten me why.
