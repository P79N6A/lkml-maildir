Subject: PROBLEM: Bug in __pollwait() can cause select() and poll() to hang in  2.4.22-pre2 -- second try
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

[1.] One line summary of the problem:
      In low memory situations, a process that issues a call to select()
or poll() can sleep forever in the kernel.
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
      select() and poll() call a common routine: __pollwait().  On the
first call to __pollwait(), it calls __get_free_page(GFP_KERNEL) to
allocate a table to hold wait queues.  In the natural course of things,
this calls into __alloc_pages().  In low memory situations, the process
can then end up in the rebalance code at the bottom of __alloc_pages()
where there is a call to yield().  If the process makes this call, this
is a bad thing [tm], since the process state at that point is
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE.  There is no wait queue yet for the process (that is
done later in __pollwait()) and no schedule timeout event has yet been
created (that is done later in select()) so the process will never
return from the call to yield().
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
      Kernel
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
      This bug appears to be present in every 2.4 kernel from (at least)
2.4.13 thru 2.4.22-pre2.  It is not present in 2.5.70, since a different
method of waiting for memory to free up is used there (in
__alloc_pages()).
[5.] Output of Oops.. message (if applicable) with symbolic information
      resolved (see Documentation/oops-tracing.txt)
      N/A.
[6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the
      problem (if possible)
      We ecountered this whilst running batch queue tests that are too
complex to include here.
[7.] Environment
[7.1.] Software (add the output of the ver_linux script here)
[7.2.] Processor information (from /proc/cpuinfo):
       We encountered this on ia64, however, this is in machine
independent code and we believe the bug is present on all 2.4.21
platforms.
[7.3.] Module information (from /proc/modules):
[7.4.] Loaded driver and hardware information (/proc/ioports,
/proc/iomem)
[7.5.] PCI information ('lspci -vvv' as root)
[7.6.] SCSI information (from /proc/scsi/scsi)
[7.7.] Other information that might be relevant to the problem
        (please look in /proc and include all information that you
        think to be relevant):
[X.] Other notes, patches, fixes, workarounds:
      The simplest fix (as suggested by Manfred Spraul) is to set
current=>state to TASK_RUNNING just before the call to yield() in
__alloc_pages().  I have tested this sufficiently that I believe
this does not change the user level semantics of select() (my
concern was that if state got set to TASK_RUNNING that the syscall
could return before any fd's are ready or the select() timeout has
expired, but this does not appear to be the case).
Here is a trivial patch against 2.4.22-pre2:
