Don't use UTF-8. Neither the kernel nor userspace is fully ready.
Also, it seems wrong to put such comples thing as a complete UNICODE upper/lower 
case mapping into the kernel, especially since this mapping is different for 
Turkish and non-Turkish cases (see 
http://www.i18nguy.com/unicode/turkish-i18n.html
). So someone should convert all 
filesystems that use character conversion and case mapping to FUSE, so that they 
can use glibc to do all of this dirty/complex work.
