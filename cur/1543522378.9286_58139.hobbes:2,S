Then tell us how ORBS can scan those hosts to determine
they're allright? Remember that above.net has blocked
ORBS...
As long as above.net doesn't give ORBS (and others?) a
way to make sure their hosts don't relay, I'm more than
happy to block their whole network (as an ORBS user).
So valinux and linux.com can't send email to vger, funet
and dozens of other sites and kernel developers?
When it starts to inconvenience them they should chose
a different ISP, I know I'll continue using ORBS...

Rik
