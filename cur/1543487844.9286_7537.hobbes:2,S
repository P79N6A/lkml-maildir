Well, I downloaded and compiled ESounD without much of a hitch.  For the 
person wondering if it will work with ALSA, it will work.  You either 
have to manually specify it in the Makefile or it auto-detects it in the 
configure script (I'm not sure which).
However, the documentation that I've found is rather weak.  Does anybody 
know how to use it?  All I've been able to gather is that the server, 
esd, sets up a port at addr:5001, where addr is the IP address you want, 
usually that of your own machine.  I was able to use esdplay to play a 
wav file, but that's about it.  Does anybody know how to automatically 
route accesses to /dev/dsp to the ESounD server (and while at it improve 
the sound quality)?
