BINGO
There may be a way to get more detailed stats out of the driver with
netstat or something, Jeff would know.

Probably something to do with packet arrival time and the ability of the
system to think it is idle.  What topology does it fail with?

Does
cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/power
show any C3 usage?
This could be either an ACPI issue -- we may enter C3 when there really
isn't enough time to enter and exit C3 w/o thrashing the system; AND/OR
a NIC problem where the driver/device is prone to over-run errors
when the latency to memory is high.
I think we're having a similar problem with the ipw2100.  it would
be interesting if you plugged an e100 into the failing config if
it fails the same way.
