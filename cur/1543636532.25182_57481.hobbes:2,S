VERY nice info, thanx. ;)
I'll have to save this info for myself; I've always been planning 
to get a dual Athlon setup sooner or later.

Yes, VIA sucks.  I've been lucky so far (all my VIA chipsets can 
be shoe-horned to stability), but it hasn't always been easy.

Is this motherboard using the Phoenix, AMI, or Award BIOS?  Award 
is nice and simple and solid; AMI is ok, but often goes too much 
for pretty looks; Phoenix SUCKS in every way possible.
What other issues have you encountered with this board (and other 
760MP/MPX boards)?  So far I've heard of an issue with 3com 
Gigabit cards on some specific model of Tyan 760MP/MPX board, 
but no definite details.  I've also heard of lm_sensors people 
having a fair amount of trouble with it.
