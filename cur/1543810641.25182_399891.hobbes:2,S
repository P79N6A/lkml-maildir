It boots and doesn't oops. I have played with libata a bit (booted off 
ext3 on LVM2 on via pata, played some CD audio tracks, and a DVD intro - 
btw this also counts as snd-fm801 test). It is still slow because of 
improper MWDMA2 setting (libata still doesn't know that master and slave 
can use different DMA speeds on via pata).
ppracer works, so this counts as r200 DRM test.
I also hit the already-known psmouse resync issue:
psmouse.c: resync failed, issuing reconnect request
input: ImExPS/2 Logitech Wheel Mouse as /class/input/input2
And, because you can read this, the 8250 serial driver and the PPP 
protocol work.
Of course the above doesn't form good testing, so I will just use this 
kernel and report if I find more.
