CONFIG_ACPI_DOCK=m
CONFIG_ATA_ACPI=y
don't work together.
particularly this:
drivers/ata/libata-acpi.c
...
#if defined(CONFIG_ACPI_DOCK) || defined(CONFIG_ACPI_DOCK_MODULE)
                        /* we might be on a docking station */
                        register_hotplug_dock_device(ap->acpi_handle,
                                                     ata_acpi_ap_notify, ap);
#endif
does not link with an EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL in dock.c when that is a module.
you can change them both to be =y (or either to be =n) to work around it.
however, this is a 2.6.25 regression, since 2.6.24 could make ATA=y
and make dock=m
