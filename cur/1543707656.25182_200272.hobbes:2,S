In 2.5.61 hpa changed
-      /* 0x28000*16 = 2.5 MB, conservative estimate for the current maximum */
-      if (sys_size > (is_big_kernel ? 0x28000 : DEF_SYSSIZE))
+      /* 0x40000*16 = 4.0 MB, reasonable estimate for the current maximum */
+      if (sys_size > (is_big_kernel ? 0x40000 : DEF_SYSSIZE))
              die("System is too big. ...");
(with comment "bootsect removal").
Today I find for a 2.6.3 machine that it boots with 2994 kB and
crashes at boot time with 3005 kB.
Thus, it looks like this "reasonable estimate" is too optimistic.
If I understand correctly, the real requirement is that
_end must stay below 8MB (unless the initial page tables
in head.S are made larger). A crash occurs with _end = c07fcf8c.
Maybe these "conservative" or "reasonable" estimates should be
replaced by a text on _end?
