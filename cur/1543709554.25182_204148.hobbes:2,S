Hi all...
I am trying to lock a file from about 40 boxes, mark a line and unlock it
(kinda job dispatcher ;) ). Via NFS.
Just 8 boxes can get the lock. After that
(even when the 8 boxes got their jobs and are working, so unlocked the file),
the rest of boxes fail on fcntl() with 'no locks available'. 
Server and clients are RH9.0, with kernel  2.4.20 (various RH versions).
Any idea ? Kernel problem ? NFS problem ? Tunable ?
TIA
