Subject: Symbol problems with 2.4.0-test[456]

Greetings - 
I'm getting undefined symbols with net modules in test[456] (haven't
tried earlier ones).  The problem goes away if I turn off
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS, which makes me suspect something strange is
happening with the EXPORT_SYMBOL macro.  Looking at the code, though, I
can't spot anything that is obviously wrong.  Suggestions (or RTFMs, as
appropriate ;-) would be much appreciated.  
Here is the output from "insmod eepro100"
/lib/modules/2.4.0-test6/kernel/drivers/net/eepro100.o: unresolved
symbol __io_virt_debug
/lib/modules/2.4.0-test6/kernel/drivers/net/eepro100.o: unresolved
symbol pci_free_consistent
/lib/modules/2.4.0-test6/kernel/drivers/net/eepro100.o: unresolved
symbol iounmap
/lib/modules/2.4.0-test6/kernel/drivers/net/eepro100.o: unresolved
symbol pci_alloc_consistent
/lib/modules/2.4.0-test6/kernel/drivers/net/eepro100.o: unresolved
symbol __ioremap
/lib/modules/2.4.0-test6/kernel/drivers/net/eepro100.o: unresolved
symbol __const_udelay
Using /lib/modules/2.4.0-test6/kernel/drivers/net/eepro100.o
Grepping through /proc/ksyms for these symbols, it appears that they are
all defined somewhat strangely:
c01c2f70 __io_virt_debug_R__ver___io_virt_debug
c010d550 pci_free_consistent_R__ver_pci_free_consistent
c010f6a0 iounmap_R__ver_iounmap
c010d4e0 pci_alloc_consistent_R__ver_pci_alloc_consistent
c010f5c8 __ioremap_R__ver___ioremap
c01c2cf8 __const_udelay_R__ver___const_udelay

P.S.  I've included my .config below, in case that contains any
