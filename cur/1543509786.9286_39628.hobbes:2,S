The same error occured to me when I recompiled the e2fsprogs-1.10, from 
RedHat 5.1 CD#2. when I tried to e2fsck partitions bigger than 2GB, it
gave me the above response. I tracked it down to the llseek function call 
which tries to read the inode table after the 2GB barrier.
In general, what shall one do if he/she wants to recompile e2fsprogs
tarball? 
I use RedHat5.1 (everything as installed by RedHat:kernel 2.0.34, 
glibc-2, etc.)  
Hardware: a Pentium 200MHz, 
	    Asus-SP97V motherboard, 
	    64MB of RAM, 
	    2MB dedicated to onboard VGA controller. 
	    10G,12G Quantum IDE disks.
all of hardware components work correctly ( and e2fsck, as I run it from
default location which is compiled in RedHat, but home-compiled e2fsck
fails).
Any ideas?
