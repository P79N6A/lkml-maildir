Subject: Question about scheduler changes from 2.2 to 2.4

In the 2.2 scheduler there was a section that checked if the previous process
was still runnable and set it as the default next running process.  It looked
like this:
	if (prev->state == TASK_RUNNING)
	   goto still_running;
still_running_back:
With another chunk of code under still_running that set "c" and "next".
In 2.4 this seems to have been removed.  Can someone explain why?  I'm porting
some custom scheduler changes and want to make sure that I understand what's
going on in 2.4.
Thanks,
Chris
