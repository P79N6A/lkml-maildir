I have compiled the linux 2.4.19 kernel for my x86 system (PC). I am
using the tigon3 NIC card in the system which uses the Broadcom BCM5700
MAC chip. When I try to load the driver written by David S. Miller and
Jeff Garzik for this card (tg3.o), I get the following error:
"Problem fetching invariants of chip"
Can someone figure out what the problem could be?
