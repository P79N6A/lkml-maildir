Me like. Assuming this means what I think it does ;-)
The kernel sets a default quiet volume level (at first setup) to make some 
sort of  noise when used I first set up the machine so users don't get 
confused ... save & restore volume levels on every boot from userspace. 
If people want silent by default, they can change that in the 
modules.conf / command line.
Is that what you meant?
