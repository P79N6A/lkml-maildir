The fallback should only be triggering on a DMA CRC error. Turning DMA
off or using ide-scsi works (as generally does using the -ac kernel
tree) because that handles partial completions correctly while readahead
caused errors break the base ide-cd driver badly.
I would suggest avoiding the ide-cd driver in the base kernel for most
purposes, at least until that bug and the "rmmod cache flush" bug are
fixed.
