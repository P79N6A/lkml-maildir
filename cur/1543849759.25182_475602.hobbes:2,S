Jeff,
Can you reproduce with 2.6.18.1?  ES4 contains a custom 3ware driver.
Also, you have included no error output with this email whatsoever.  Can
you go to a virtual console during your ES4 install, run 'dmesg', and see if
the errors are in there, or if they are a part of the ES4 anaconda installer?
/dev/sdb, etc. having delayed appearances sounds like it is udev related.
Are you running the latest firmware?  Do your controllers older than 60 days
have different firmware?
I will try to reproduce this.
