Is the SSID from the probe response really used here? Your patch did not
look like that.. The SSID from the last scan request command may not be
the one that triggered the last scan (e.g., one could request a new scan
without specifying an SSID).

I don't see how the proposed patch would be using the correct SSID value
in all cases. Especially cases where there are multiple APs using hidden
SSIDs, but with different real SSID values and cases where multiple scan
requests are being processed would be likely to leave windows open for
reporting incorrect SSID.
