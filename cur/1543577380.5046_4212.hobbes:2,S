Make sure you have compiled into your kernel (not modules) IDE,
ext2, and ELF.  If you're using SCSI, substitute it with IDE
above.

Want to run Microsoft Windows software in Linux?  You can!  VMware allows 
you to install and run other operating systems inside a window in X windows.
You can install Windows 95/98/NT/2000, FreeBSD, Solaris, and many more.
3D Games do not work yet, but virtually all office and productivity software
runs excellent.
