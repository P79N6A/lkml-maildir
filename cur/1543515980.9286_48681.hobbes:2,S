You've lost:
Computer: K6-200, 128 MB Ram, Symbios 810 scsi controller, Fujitsu
Magneto-Optical drive, 620 MB [I have no empty scsi disc left :(],
620,000,000 bytes test file, fat filesystem, the same disk is used for
NT and Linux.
command: "./pagein fill 150000 #" where fill is the filename, 150000
means 150000 pages are trashed, and # is the number of threads.
Linux:
#	pages/sec
1	13
4	14
64	14
256	? [computer unresponsive]
NT:
#	pages/sec
1	18
4	20
64	28
256	31
512	33
Linux is slower, and it cannot use multiple threads to reorder the
sector reads;
NT gets faster if I add further threads.
