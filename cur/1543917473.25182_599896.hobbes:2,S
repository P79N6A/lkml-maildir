There have been a lot of spats about how functionality has been
partitioned between the driver and the firmware, issues with how the
driver tries to do things that either ought to be in mac80211 or not
done at all, and some random complaints about ugliness like '#include
"../../../net/mac80211/blah.h"', etc.  There is still plenty of work
to be done on this driver, but as you point out we are better-off
with it in the kernel than with it out.
Thanks,
John
