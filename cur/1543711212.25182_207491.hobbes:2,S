the filebacked stuff is already separated, what can be separated further
is the preparation for the page->as.mapping support.

I know of big iron critical workloads where mine will work better,
though I agree for a desktop not runing kde the anonm is cheaper in
terms of memory utilization (saves .

the anonmm would take 12*2085+6613*12 = 104k less in my 1G desktop loaded with
my usual stuff (not really, the difference is less than 100k since anonmm takes
quite some bytes, which is significant too if we count the kbytes like I'm
doing), I believe those 100k may be worth it for the super high end workload
swapping 8G on a 16G box with hundred of tasks each task with its own anonymous
direct memory big chunk of memory, anon_vma will avoid checking all hundred MM
for each anon page we swap, plus it gets mremap efficiently which sounds safer
for the short term.
