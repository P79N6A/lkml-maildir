Not that it really matters that much --- but I'm curious to know why
Intel made this decision?
It seems really dumb to make such differences when Intel is already
sorely lagging behind their competitor here, I would think given the
circumstances Intel would try to be as compatible as possible on all
fronts.
I'd almost be nervous about getting an IA-32e CPU right now given that
the AMD64 chips work just fine, have had lots of testing and there is
plenty of code out there which is *known* to work reliably.
