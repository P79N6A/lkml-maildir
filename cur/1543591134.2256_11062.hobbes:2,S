Yes. I like to give this fbdevfs a try. Once tested I have no problem
placing it into my kernel tree I have. I planned on reworking the fbdev
layer anyways for 2.5.X. As Linus pointed out is the backwards
compatiabilty. Maybe name it to something else. Since I like to see fbdev
and drm merge we need a new name anyways. Later I can migrate DRI
functionality into this filesystem. It would be a nice demo. It would be
really cool if I could stream the framebuffer image over a network :-)
