:-))) You will never think it works like this. And you is the first one fro 
whom I hear this.

For read/write. Although it is incorrect to compare as thttpd is serving more 
than one connect.

Logic with alarms will not work in multithreaded case.

I assume that using SO_RCVTIME/SO_SNDTIME would be better in terms of 
performance. Maybe it worse of it to upgrade to 2.4.x, and rewrite network 
layer to use sync IP... I will think about it. How many times better it would 
be (approximately)? if we assume that I have lots of connects which transfers 
small amount of data in each (1-2K).
