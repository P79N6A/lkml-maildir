Subject: [PATCH 0/17] various irq handler cleanups
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This series continues the work of running through irq handlers that use
their 'irq' argument -- almost always for trivial (or even wrong)
reasons.
In many cases, this work eliminates some pointless code in the fastpath,
and/or otherwise makes interrupt handling [ever so] slightly more
efficient and clean.
As usual, this work is being committed to the 'irq-cleanups' branch of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/misc-2.6.git
which encompasses the following changes (includes some previously
posted, and not re-posted in this series):
older cleanups:
      [PARPORT] Consolidate code copies into a single generic irq handler
      [PARPORT] Kill useful 'irq' arg from parport_{generic_irq,ieee1284_interru
      [PARPORT] Remove unused 'irq' argument from parport irq functions
      [BLUETOOTH] Eliminate checks for impossible conditions in irq handler
      Eliminate pointless casts from void* in a few driver irq handlers.
      [SPARC, XEN, NET/CXGB3] use irq_handler_t where appropriate
      [NETDRVR] lib82596, netxen: delete pointless tests from irq handler
      [SCSI] aha152x: delete pointless test in irq handler
      [ATM, CHAR, TOUCHSCREEN] remove needless use of irq handler first arg
new cleanups:
      [IRQ ARG CLEANUP] more driver cleanups
      drivers/char/ip2: split out irq core logic into separate function
      drivers/char/ip2: separate polling and irq-driven work entry points
