indeed... :( anyway, setup.ld has the definition of __bss_stop too
though in this case __bss_stop is not equal to _end BUT
[__bss_start;__bss_stop] do cover *bss section anyway.
According to Sam's last post it will not be a problem anymore
'cause of memset further usage.
Thanks for comments, Peter.
