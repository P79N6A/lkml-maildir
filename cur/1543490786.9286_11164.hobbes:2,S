Why _should_ us.kernel.org be the first to get the new kernel?

I've often thought that, but OTOH it probably isn't really practical. The only
thing that really bugs me is trying to grab the pre-patches: by the time
they've arrived at a local mirror or I've managed to actually get onto
ftp.kernel.org, they tend to have been superceded, often by the final patch.
Which kind of defeats the point of making the pre-patches available so people
can test for problems before the final release.
