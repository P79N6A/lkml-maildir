actually a single client doing nasty (non RT) stuff in its process()
callback can "starve" jackd. AFAIK jackd waits until the last client has
finished its process callback. So, if some client's process callback
decides to use (for example) some blocking system call (big no no) and
consequently falls asleep for a relatively long time, then it can cause
jackd to miss its deadline. I'm not sure though wether this triggers an
xrun in jackd or just a delay exceeded message.
