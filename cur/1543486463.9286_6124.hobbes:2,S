I have recently built a new computer, and when I tried to install linux
on it, with the net.i and bare.i bootdisks, I got the error: "keyboard
timed out."  This occured after the boot parameters line but before the
rootdisk insertion.  After this error, I am unable to use my keyboard in
Linux.  I have tried many things, downloading bootdisks, reformatting
and rerawriting the disk, different keyboards both of which work under
Linux on this machine.  Windows 95 works fine on it, as does DOS.  It
loads DOS bootdisks fine.  Both bootdisk images were from at least
Slackware 3.4.  If anyone can help me out or give me some insight,
please do so! :)
