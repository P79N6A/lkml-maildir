For MAX_NUMNODES > BITS_PER_LONG, thats just what these are.  There are
just built-in optimizations for the single bit (UP for cpumask, non-NUMA
for nodemask) case and the single unsigned long case.  For the case of a
single unsigned long, the bitmap operations aren't as efficient as just
doing a 
	res = (mask1 & mask2);
vs. 
	bitmask_and(&res, &mask1, &mask2);
Maybe I'm overly concerned about the speed of these ops at the expense
of code size.  If that's the consensus, I'll gladly look at a simpler
implementation.  As I said, my only real goal is to stop people open
coding these types of operations.
