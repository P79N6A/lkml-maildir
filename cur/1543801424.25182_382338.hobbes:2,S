Works for me, thanks.
Perhaps it is time to get 1/4 and 3/4 into -mm? You get my signed-off
on them...
2/4 needs to allocate official major/minor. 1/13 would be nice :-).
4/4... I'm not sure. It would be nice to make swsusp.c disappear. It
is really wrong name. That means we need to only delete from it for a
while...
