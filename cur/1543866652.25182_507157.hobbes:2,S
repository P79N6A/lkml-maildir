Subject: [PATCH -mm] libata: warn if speed limited due to 40-wire cable
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/9/452

Print an explicit warning when a device's UDMA mode is limited due to
a 40-wire cable being detected, so that users have some idea why their
device isn't running as fast as it should.
This moves the application of the drive's mode masks before the cable
rule, so that can tell whether the rate is being limited by the cable
and not the drive or controller.
I haven't tested whether the message actually shows up, as my system
isn't horked in this manner..
