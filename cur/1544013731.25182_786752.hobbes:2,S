To clarify: the MT_TOUCH_MAJOR is to track a touchpoint over time, and the
BLOB_ID to compile a arbitrarily shaped touchpoint within the same event?
Would it make sense to allow specification of a blob as bit/bytemask? There
are a few devices that can do detection of multi-color non-rectangular
touchpoints, especially camera-based systems. Limiting these to a sequence of
rectangles means dropping information that may be useful for certain tasks
(e.g. fingerprint detection).
OTOH, a rectangle as bounding box with an accompanying (optional) bytemask can
pass this data on to prospective clients.
