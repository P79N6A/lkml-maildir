Interesting. Wish the mainstream AMD K8 CPUs had one too :)

If it's faster than the i386 assembly version I think you
should add it.

Declarations don't need ifdefs.

This should use readl

The bracket should be on an own line. Further occurrences.

This should be unsigned long

This should be ioremap_nocache()
