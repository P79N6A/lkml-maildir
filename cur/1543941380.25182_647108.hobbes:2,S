Hi Erez,
Aside from the occasional "unionfs: new lower inode mtime" messages
on directories (which I've got into the habit of ignoring now), the
only problem I'm still suffering with unionfs over tmpfs (not tested
any other fs's below it recently) is oops in unionfs_copy_attr_times.
I believe I'm working with your latest: 2.6.24-rc8-mm1 plus the four
patches you posted to lkml on 26 Jan.  But this problem has been around
for a while before that: I'd been hoping to debug it myself, but taken
too long to make too little progress, so now handing over to you.
The oops occurs while doing repeated "make -j20" kernel builds in a
unionfs mount of a tmpfs (though I doubt tmpfs is relevant): most of
my testing was while swapping, but today I find that's irrelevant,
and it should happen much quicker without.  SMP kernels (4 cpus),
I haven't tried UP; happens with or without PREEMPT, may just be
coincidence that it happens quicker on the machines with PREEMPT.
Most commonly it's unionfs_copy_attr_times called from unionfs_create,
but that's probably just the most common route in this workload:
I've seen it also when called from unionfs_rename or unionfs_open or
unionfs_unlink.  It looks like there's a locking or refcounting bug,
hence a race: the unionfs_inode_info which unionfs_copy_attr_times
is working on gets changed underneath it, so it oopses on NULL
lower_inodes.  It took me far too long to realize that ibstart
(and ibend) are -1 when it oopses, yet the function returns
immediately if ibstart is negative on entry.  I've not a clue
what it is that's changing it.
What I did make progress with yesterday was a workaround patch, which
additionally makes the problem more manifest: by WARNing in much more
common cases which were invisible (didn't go so far as to oops) before.
The oops had typically taken 12 hours to happen, but I'm getting like
one warning per hour (varies from machine to machine) with the patch
while swapping, and now much more frequently giving it more memory.
I've two patches.  The first isn't interesting, so I just attached
it.  It moves unionfs_copy_attr_times (and unionfs_copy_attr_all)
from inline in fanout.h to out-of-line in copyup.c: the function's
too big and too widely used to be suitable for inlining, this reduces
kernel text by about 6k.  But since making that patch, I've seen that
copyup.c is really about copying up the data, and you may well prefer
to move the functions to subr.c or elsewhere.
The patch to go on top of that is appended below: makes unionfs_copy
_attr_times more paranoid about the fields it's accessing; but this
can only be a temporary workaround - so long as there's such a race,
it could be accessing freed/reused memory with unpredictable results.
Most of the warnings I see with this patch are the first, on bend < 0:
the old "bindex <= ibend(upper)" condition would often have terminated
the loop in that case, without noticing the discrepancy that ibend
had gone negative.  Occasionally I'm seeing the second warning, on
lower_inodes, which would correspond to the oops: here's a trace
(cutting out the ? lines, just stale addresses left on the stack):
