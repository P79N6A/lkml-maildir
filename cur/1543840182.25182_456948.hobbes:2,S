Why identify a format with a UUID rather than via a nice human-readable name?

Is pfm_smpl_fmt_lock really needed?  The module API _should_ be unracy wrt
lookup and removal.  If the name of the module was equal to the name of the
format (sensible) then perhaps the module system's
refcounting/atomicity/lookup mechanisms are sufficient?

Please check for and handle all sysfs-related errors.  All errors, indeed.
Yes, a lot of the kernel blithely assumes that sysfs operations never fail.
We need to fix that badness rather than copy it.
