I assume the problem arises from the fact that depmod are only capable of
reading elf files for the host it is compiled for.
OK, took a look at depmod.
It handles both 32 and 64 bit but assumes same endian.
Rusty: Would it make sense to extend module-init-tools to support
endian as specified in elf file?
