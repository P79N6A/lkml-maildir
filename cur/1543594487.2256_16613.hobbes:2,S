I had already two crashes with ac15. The system was still ping-able, but
login over the network didn't work anymore.
The first crash happened after I started xosview and noticed that the
system almost used up the swap (for no apparent reason). The second
crash happened shortly after I started fsck on a crypto-loop device.
This does not happen with ac14, even under heavy load.
I noticed a second problem: Sometimes the system hangs completely for
approximately ten seconds, but continues just fine after that. I have
seen this with ac14 and ac15, but not with ac12.
This is a mixed IDE/SCSI (Adaptec) system, 128MB RAM/256MB swap on a
Gigabyte 440LX mainboard with a Pentium II.
