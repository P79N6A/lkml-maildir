 I would like to second that request. Those 7902 pop up in a lot of new
motherboards recently and not having them in mailine is a PITA.
 The driver itself seems to be OK, but there seems to be a higher
sensitivity to cabling and drive quality that with U160. I am just now
fighting with some FUJITSU MAP3735NC on a SuperMicro P4DP8-G2
motherboard that only work OK when running at 160 MB/s.
