Myself and Jakob Oestergaard have seen the same race, and the tentative 
fix from Trond was similar to yours. I haven't been able to reproduce 
the problem after applying that fix.
Perhaps it's time to propagate the patch upstream? Most recent 2.4.x 
kernels are affected...

Yup, that's the race all right.
