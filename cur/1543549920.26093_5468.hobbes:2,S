Exactly the same here. I've seen the same crash three times today (not
having suffered from mysterious crashes here):
- I do something (typically starting a program; the one I've just seen
started this behaviour just as icecast started its extra threads)
- The hard disk starts grinding (as if I were going deeply into swap), and
my X session freezes
- Hitting alt-sysrq-u might work if I'm lucky, but normally only alt-sysrq-b
is available
However, I'm probably not a useful datapoint, as I'm running 2.4.0-test8 +
reiserfs-3.9.16 + 2.4.0-t8-sched + 2.4.0-t8-vmpatch4. The machine's a K6-2
450MHz with 160Mb of RAM, a few IDE disks and an NE2000 card, running
XFree86 v4.0.1.
Previous 2.4.0-test kernels have been rock solid for me, which is probably a
good sign.
