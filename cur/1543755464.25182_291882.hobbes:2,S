By default, Windows "multimedia" timers have 10ms resolution (this
depends on the exact version of Windows used...).  You can call the
timeBeginPeriod() function to lower the resolution to 1ms.
This resolution seem related to the task scheduler timeslice.  After you
call this function, the Sleep() call has also a resolution of 1ms
instead of 10ms.
I remember reading that the multimedia timers are implemented as a high
priority thread.
You can found more details on this site :
