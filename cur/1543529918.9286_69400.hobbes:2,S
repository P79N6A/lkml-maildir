I don't know enough about SMB to be certain.
The important thing is that there needs to be a way to map between a
"filehandle" of limited size (32 bytes for NFSv2) and a file.  With
ext2fs and similar, the inode number is used.  I don't know if SMB
supports a similar sort of handle.
The UNFSD does it by using a hash of the path name and keeping a
cache.  It works 98% of the time.
