Nope, the cpu_online map should catch this. NR_CPUS is always 32
in SMP mode.
in get_cpuinfo ....
                if (!(cpu_online_map & (1<<n)))
                        continue;
I didn't notice that this would only work in SMP mode. 
It's a horrible hack, but it's less horrible than corrupting memory randomly ;-)
