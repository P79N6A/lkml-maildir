>Perhaps we shouldnt boot in case the user takes the CPU out while running ?
	MULTICS eventually supported hot-swapped CPUs, right?  Why
shouldn't we?
Mar 31 13:01:04 rockhopper kernel: CPU1: Intel Pentium 75 - 200 stepping 01
unmount /dev/cpu1
Mar 31 13:00:00 rockhopper kernel: CPU1: offline
mount /dev/cpu1
Mar 31 13:01:04 rockhopper kernel: CPU1: Intel Pentium 500 stepping 01
	Even more advanced systems might support:
eject /dev/cpu0
	Now, if the user removes the CPU without unmounting it
first, well, that's a user error...
