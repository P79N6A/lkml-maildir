That doesn't say _anything_ about the source of contention.

Sigh...  OK, here's an exercise:
You have a spinlock and two functions - hog() and light().  Both grab that
spinlock.  light() releases it and returns fast.  hog() spends quite a
while in critical area and then releases the lock.
a) show that if lock gets contended then most of the time it will be
held by hog()
b) show that time spent spinning in light() depends mostly on the amount
of time spent in hog()
c) replace light() with light1(), ..., lightN().  Compare the effect
of removing lock from one of them with that of removing it from hog().
d) characterize the dependence of light()/light() contention upon the
amount of time spent in hog().  (hint: attempts to call light()
while hog() is running will lead to accumulation of contenders and when
hog() is done they _will_ figth each other).
General rules:
	* go for hogs first, don't try to pick the light ones.
	* one spinning most is not necessary the cause of contention.
	* even when you see real light/light contention - check the
history immediately before; you may find the hog that had had held them
back.
