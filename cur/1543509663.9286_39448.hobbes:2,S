Tonight my system crashed again and I had to reboot it. During the
reboot phase I have set the BIOS clock correctly by hand. xntpd is now
disabled. The binaries clock and hwclock are working now. However
one entry in /proc/rtc remains to be out of order:
rtc_time        : 08:59:56
rtc_date        : 1999-09-17
rtc_epoch       : 1900
alarm           : **:**:57
DST_enable      : no
BCD             : yes
24hr            : yes
square_wave     : no
alarm_IRQ       : no
update_IRQ      : no
periodic_IRQ    : no
periodic_freq   : 1024
batt_status     : okay
So my question is now: Which process sets the alarm flag and under what
circumstances can the above
entry be displayed?
I should also mention that per default "hwclock -s"  and "hwclock -a"
have been called during boot up
(SuSE 6.0 and START_XNTPD=no in /etc/rc.local).
