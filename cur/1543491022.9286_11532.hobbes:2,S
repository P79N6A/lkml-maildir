                  It's time for a dose of indisputable logic:
Linux is a kernel. Saying 'I use Linux' amounts to saying 'I use a car engine',
when what people really are refering to is the entire vehicle.
There are quite a few operating systems out there using Linux as their kernel.
Debian, Redhat, and Suse to name a few. These OS's all have their differences.
But one thing that is common among the majority (AFAIK all) of them is the core
of the system is based on FSF tools, aka the base GNU utilities. It is this
base that gives these operating systems a common feel, and direct compatibility
among scripts, et al, not to mention the usage license.
If an operating system was based purely on BSD tools (and I'm sure one is
around or in the works), or proprietary tools, it would have a distinctly
different feel, differences in operation, and command incompatibilities.
Thus, referring to the spectrum of FSF tools and Linux kernel based operating
systems as GNU/Linux is not a matter of respect, but a matter of accuracy!
Put Linux in a ROM that addresses a single program. You're using Linux, but is
that something comparable to Redhat??? Say IBM transplants the Linux kernel
into AIX. You're using Linux but is it ANYTHING like what you REALLY mean by
the term?
Finally, and of course, without the FSF, the GPL, and gcc, GNU/Linux operating
systems would in no way exist in the way they do today, if at all. It is
therefor nice to give the PEOPLE of the FSF their do. I see a lot of names on
these core GNU programs. 'GNU' means a lot more then just the hard work of
one man named Rich Stallman.
I have said my peace. So let it be written, so let it be done.
