Linus, please, don't do this.
It is sometimes usefull to have update suspended. If you have a
notebook, and your drives are spinned down, it is bad idea to run
update. 
Up till now, everything was ok, because kernel accessed disk anyway
when it needed. Up till now killing update was safe. I depend on this
behaviour and would like if it stayed safe.
This is not the same as killing init. (Killing init did not use to
work before.)
