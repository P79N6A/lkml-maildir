I got larted on the grounds that i write lame changelogs so here we go 
again :}
parse_interface allocates the incorrect storage size for additional 
altsettings (new buffer) leading to a BUG being triggered in 
mm/slab.c:1453 when we do the memcpy from the old buffer to the new 
buffer (writing beyond new buffer).
