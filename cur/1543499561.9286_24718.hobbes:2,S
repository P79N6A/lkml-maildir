Yes, it is:
expanse: ~  17:40:41  # mkdir ~ookhoi/down
expanse: ~  17:41:25  # ls -ald ~ookhoi/down/
drwxr-xr-x   2 root     root         1024 Jun 18 17:41
/home/ookhoi/down//
ookhoi $ ls -ald down/
drwxr-xr-x   2 root     root         1024 Jun 18 17:41 down//
ookhoi $ rm -rf down/
ookhoi $ ls -ald down/
ls: down/: No such file or directory
This is because you have write-access in your homedir.
		Groetjes, Ookhoi
