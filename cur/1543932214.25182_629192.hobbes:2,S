No, init_cache_objs() will call the constructor, if the cache has one when 
DEBUG is not set so the struct idr_layer can never be undefined. However, 
struct idr_layer can contain non-zero elements if someone does a 
kmem_cache_free() on an object that hasn't been zeroed. If that matters 
here, idr_pre_get should call kmem_cache_zalloc() and drop the 
constructor.
