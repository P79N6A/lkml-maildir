Subject: 2.5.70 / 2.5.71 - Problem at Uncompressing Linux... OK

I am just beginning to experiment with 2.5, my appologies if I have
missed something. If there are other resources that could have answered
this question, I eagerly await suggestions.
With both 2.5.70 and 2.5.71, when the machine boots, it gets to
"Uncompressing Linux... OK", and then it stops there. Disk activity is
clearly still going on. After a short time, I can ping it, or other
network activity. If I try to ssh into it, I am asked my password. After
hitting enter, nothing happens. I can try this repeatedly to no avail.
Am I missing something fundamental here?
Thank you for your time.
