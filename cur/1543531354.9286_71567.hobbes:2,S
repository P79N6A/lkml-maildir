I've just put four hypersparc processors in my sparc 10 8^)

As such, the old superSparc processor that was in there is going
begging.  In the interests of further linux sparc SMP development,
I've decided to donate this beast to any kernel hacker who wants it.
I also have a spare sparc 10 boot prom for the old processor and one
for the Hypersparcs as well.
Please respond in private.
Sean
P.S.  In the event of a dead heat, preference will be given to someone 
who can explain to me why compiling packages such as "sudo" and "ssh"
on my sparc (redhat 6.1) is failing so dismally
