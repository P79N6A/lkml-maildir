Almost agreed, it papers over the lack of locking, however most forms of
locking may need this to avoid a deadlock anyhow.  (I don't know the
semantics of kill_fasync, and thus I don't know if attempting to take a
lock in the close that is held here would deadlock, or if execution
would move back to here, but I have a nasty feeling that it's the
former.)
That said, at the moment, we have a 100% guaranteed oops on rmmod usbhid
if something has the device open, which is bad.
