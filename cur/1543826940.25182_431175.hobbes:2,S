"Pentium-4/Celeron(P4-based)/Pentium-4 M/Xeon" are all family 15, not family 6.
I have a Pentium M, it's family 6 model 13. Also, AFAIK the Intel Core
is based on the Pentium M (which in turn is based on Pentium III). So,
my personal best guess would be to choose "Pentium M".
Unfortunately, I don't have one of these (Intel Core) at this point,
so I can't test it myself...
