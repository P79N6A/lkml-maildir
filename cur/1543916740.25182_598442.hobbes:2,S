Probably not.

After you ran "make oldconfig" ?
I don't know much about ARM configs.  You should probably be asking
about this on some linux-arm mailing list.
However, I did
  make ARCH=arm s3c2410_defconfig
and that particular board config enables ISA.  Then if I enabled
NET_PCI, I can also enable CS89x0.
The default ARM config (if there is one) doesn't seem to enable ISA.
