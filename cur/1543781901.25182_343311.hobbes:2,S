That fixed it, thanks.

I wonder if hald knows something about this and is polling.. however that 
message above about "Device  not ready" occurs when the kernel is booting, 
before any userspace stuff has started up.  Maybe hald is just being a bit 
aggressive in re-probing the drive after userspace launches.  B all accounts 
after a week of uptime the drive certainly ought to be ready, it seems to work 
ok ;-)
Note the extra space after 'Device' and 'not' which implies possibly some text 
is missing (which would have made it more clear which device is not exactly 
ready).  The case sensitive strings "Device" and "not ready" appears together 
in scsi_lib.c and very few other places.

The CD can be read, and the error messages go away.  They stay away even after 
the CD has been ejected.

Machine was booting up ok, and things were being written to syslog.  Rebooted 
into -rc5-mm1 to investigate, and of course could boot into rc6-mm1 in single 
user mode, test and bring services up one by one from there.  Having two boxes 
helped too.

Not sure if this is needed anymore, as I found that the problem goes away when 
I compile in kernel auditing.  This not required for -rc5-mm1.  Is that change 
intended?
