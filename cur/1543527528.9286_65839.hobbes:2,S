There are filesystems around (FAT comes to mind) that have nothing
inode-like on which you could pin capabilities. It is certainly possible to
overwrite a file now, and the result has the same inode as before. So the
above will have to be supplemented with extra mechanisms, which will be
security-critical. Dunno if that is feasible.
