The previous version of my multiqueue patches I sent for consideration
had feedback from Patrick McHardy asking that the user be able to
configure the PRIO qdisc to run with multiqueue support or not.  That is
why TC needed a modification, since I agreed with Patrick that this
would be a useful option.
All the versions of multiqueue network device support I've sent for
consideration had PRIO modified to support multiqueue devices, since it
lends itself well for the model of multiple, independent flows.

Since this change affects how tc interacts with the qdisc layer, I cced
lkml.

As long as someone is looking at them, I'll be happy.  :-)
