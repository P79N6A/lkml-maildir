There is no obsession. This just happens to be a real life issue.
Basically, the nondeterministic behavior of these things is NMI oopsing
my machines and those of users (who often just cut the power instead of
running the NMI oopser). get_pid() is actually not the primary offender,
but is known to be problematic along with the rest of them. I don't
really care whose pet algorithm is used so long as it doesn't explode
when breathed on. And Ingo's algorithm looks excellent to me.
This is furthermore blocking VM testing and development for many tasks
scenarios meant to emulate and optimize usage typical of machines in
the field.
