We should not do _anything_ in __find_page_nolock().
It's positively wrong to touch any aging information there - if you do,
you are guaranteed to not get read-ahead right (ie a page that gets
read-ahead first will behave differently than a page that got read
directly, which just cannot be right).
The aging has to be done at a higher level (ie when you actually _use_
it, not when you search the hash queues).
