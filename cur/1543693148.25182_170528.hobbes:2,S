I remember Linus ranting about swap at one point, but it's been a while.
What is the current state of the need for swap on a linux kernel, 2.4.20 in 
specific. Does it need *any*, given some reasonable amount of RAM? What 
constitutes a reasonable of RAM?
My recent experience suggest none is needed.
