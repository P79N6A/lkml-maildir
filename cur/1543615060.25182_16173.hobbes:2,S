Hm, I think I saw something the like. The configuration was basically SuSE 7.3
(with 2.4.10-whatever kernel) and two Realtek cards in a not-trusted cheap box.
I saw a good amount of collisions on the network, too. I replaced the Realteks
with DLink and the kernel with 2.4.16 and it did not happen again, although the
network collisions stayed the same. I tend to think it is the old kernel, but I
don't like Realtek cards anyway, so I threw them out in one go.
Tell us if it happens again with 2.4.17, or if you are sure it does not,
declare it as solved.
Regards,
Stephan
