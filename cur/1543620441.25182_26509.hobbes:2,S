This is very strange in fact.
What do you do to get these messages?

It means that when we are trying to insert a new block in list of file's blocks
(to fill a hole or something) we encountering that somebody have inserted
the block while we were doing other things.
This was the case with truncating file past its end and then mmap-writing there.
But this particular place was fixed by introducing "expanding truncate" patch.
And please CC reiserfs specific bugreports to reiserfs-list@namesys.com
Thank you.
Bye,
