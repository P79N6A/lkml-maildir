No, line 199 is safe. But you risk deadlocking at line 210 because you
call the page allocator with GFP_KERNEL at that point (which includes
__GFP_IO and __GFP_FS).

Doesn't matter, since you are already deadlocked on the ->alloc call. If
you have IO set in the gfp_mask, you could reenter your own driver,
which will call ->alloc, which will reenter... And then you hang.

No, you need to use GFP_NOIO. You can block on the mempool itself,
because the objects you allocate from there have a finite life time.
They will be freed once some io completes. But you cannot block on other
IO, because that might be up to you do to.
So the safe mask simply __GFP_WAIT - it allows blocking waiting for your
mempool to refill, nothing more.
