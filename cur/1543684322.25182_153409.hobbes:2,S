Subject: Kernel 2.4 and 2.6 disagree about NFSEXP_CROSSMNT - upward incompatibility, please fix

According to Steve Dickson:

This looks like an actual kernel incompatibility 2.4 <-> 2.6, as
the 2.4 and 2.6 trees disagree about the value of NFSEXP_CROSSMNT.

And 2.6's include/linux/nfsd/export.h needs the same fix.  This needs
to go in before the 2.6.0 release or nfs-utils is in deep kimchi.
