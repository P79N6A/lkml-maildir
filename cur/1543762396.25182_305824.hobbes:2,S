That's definitely the case.  See my earlier post on this topic:
  
http://www.gelato.unsw.edu.au/linux-ia64/0409/11012.html
Unfortunately, nobody reported any results for larger machines and/or
more interesting workloads, so the patch is in limbo at this time.
Clearly, if the CPU that's clearing the page is likely to use that
same page soon after, it'd be useful to use temporal stores.
