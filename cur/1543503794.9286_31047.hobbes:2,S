Subject: compile error in re. SKnet MCA support

On a brand new 2.2.10 from scratch with unrelated minor tweaks
to init/main.c the compile failed with something about
"sk_something called with too few arguments." 
Sorry, that's all I have. This is with SKnet MCA support, which I duly 
turned off, which is why the report is vague. Emailme if you want the
.config.
