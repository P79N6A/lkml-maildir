It is a double requeue. The SCSI path looks really messy (and buggy
there). What happens is that the host queuecommand sets DID_ERROR and
calls scsi_done() on the command, which may decide the commands need
retrying and thus requeue it. Upon return from queuecommand, the SCSI
layer initiates a requeue of the request because queuecommand returned
1. Double requeue, request list is now screwed.
James, it looks like the queuecommand returns need an overhaul so it's
clear who does what and when.
You can work around the issue with this patch (I hope, not tested), I'll
see if I can scrub the paths a little.
