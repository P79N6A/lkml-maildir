You can't do much about unused variables because, as you suggested, they
may be present with a different config.  For example, the unused
attach_it label in super.c is used if NFS is defined.
As for the typecast error, we should fix that...the attached patch uses
the typed min system macro.  Linus, the attached is against
2.4.14-pre3.  Please, apply.
