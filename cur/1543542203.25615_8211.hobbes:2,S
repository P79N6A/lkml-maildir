Hmm, I haven't tried your patch yet (my 2.4 machine is at home, I'll
try this evening), but I thing there is a better solution. I believe
the point is that
  if (!MERGE_NEW_REQ(rq))
      ADD_NEW(rq);
is not atomic then the queue is full because it needs to release the
lock while waiting.
Perhaps we can workaroung the problem by allocating a new request
first and then we lock, see if our rq is still here, and scan the
list to look for an old rq to coalesce with. If we find one, we can
free the rq, otherwise we simply leave the rq on the list. Finally
we unlock the list.

:)) Murphy's law.
