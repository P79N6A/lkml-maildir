No. BOTH of the above are buggy.
The C language definition doesn't allow signed integers to wrap (ie it's 
undefined behaviour), so "a-b < 0" can be rewritten by the compiler as a 
simple signed "a < b".
And the unsigned (or signed) "a < b" is just broken wrt any kind of 
wrap-around (whether wrapping around zero or the sign bit).
So the _only_ valid way to handle timers is to
 - either not allow wrapping at all (in which case "unsigned" is better, 
   since it is bigger)
 - or use wrapping explicitly, and use unsigned arithmetic (which is 
   well-defined in C) and do something like "(long)(a-b) > 0".
Notice? The signed variant is basically _never_ correct.
