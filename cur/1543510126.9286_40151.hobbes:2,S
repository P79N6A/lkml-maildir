That works for ACLs, but isn't very satisfactory in general. There
aren't seperate VFS entries for mode bits, uid, and group after all.
If you're going to extend the VFS interface do so to support pairs
of attribute names and data. This way you can support ACLs, Capability
sets, and/or whatever else you can cram into your underlying file
system. Makes optional features easier, too.
