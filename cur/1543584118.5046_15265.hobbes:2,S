Since the linux kernel is not preemptive, the problem is a little
bit more complicated; A low priority kernel thread won't lose the 
CPU while holding a lock except if it wants to. That simplifies the
locking problem you mention but the idea of background low priority 
threads that run when the machine is really idle is also not this
simple.
