note that CFS's "granularity" value is not directly comparable to 
"timeslice length":

also, i just checked SD: 0.46 defaults to 8 msecs rr_interval (on 1 CPU 
systems), which is lower than the 10 msecs effective timeslice length 
CVS-v5 achieves on two CPU-bound tasks.
(in -v6 i'll scale the granularity up a bit with the number of CPUs, 
like SD does. That should get the right result on larger SMP boxes too.)
while i agree it's a tad too finegrained still, I agree with Con's 
choice: rather err on the side of being too finegrained and lose some 
small amount of throughput on cache-intense workloads like compile jobs, 
than err on the side of being visibly too choppy for users on the 
desktop.
