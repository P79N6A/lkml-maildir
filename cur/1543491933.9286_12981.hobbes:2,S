I got the same problem with matrox mystique 170 (the older one, using
xsvga-server). I think the difference between yours and mine problem is, that
the "mysterious" does not happen to me every time I switch from X to the
console.
I noticed this very often by switching from X to console while kdm/xdm is coming
up.
Greetings, Dietmar
