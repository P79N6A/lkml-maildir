The usual caveat is how we all wait for this to go into 2.6.

That part looked ok. Such computers are semi-popular. Our QA department
has Thinkpads with similarly broken BIOS. I'm glad you did not decide
to call panic() in such case :-)

I think it's an unfortunate naming. When I was reading the patch, I got
the meaning exactly backwards. I think that we should not be afraid
of using something like "do handoff" or "do NOT do a handoff" in the
documentation and flag names, for extra clarity.
