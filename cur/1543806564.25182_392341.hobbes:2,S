nobody is arguing to have this hack included. Hacks are to be introduced 
into the scheduler only over my cold dead body ;-) Steve only sent this 
as an RFC thing, to raise the issue.

just to give you an idea of what we have achieved with the -rt kernel so 
far: my regular -rt stress-test setup has a "hackbench 50" in its 
"deadly mix of SCHED_OTHER workloads", in addition to 40 parallel runs 
of LTP runalltests.sh, with flood pinging and other networking and IO 
stresstests, combined with a task that allocates and dirties a 1.5GB 
buffer in an infinite loop while there's only 1GB of RAM - and still 
during many hours of running this stress-test (which produces a load 
average of 200-500) the -rt kernel runs SCHED_FIFO tasks in 20 usecs, 
worst-case.
