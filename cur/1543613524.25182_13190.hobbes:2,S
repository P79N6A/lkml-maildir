I had the exact same problem with this chipset (Adaptec 2904), but I 
increased the "Initial bus reset delay" from 150 ms to 250 and solved it.
By the way, do you have cdrom's attached to your scsi card? Beware, 
since 2.5.1-pre8 (at least) the PC will hang solid if I try to mount a 
data cd. Up to 2.5.1-pre11 the problem remains. Can you verify this 
(without mounting any disk, of course)?
