yes, but it's a bit trickier than remotely telling a script to basically
do chdir("/proc/1/cwd").

OK, but that's not a reason for breaking trivial protection against
trivial escape methods.
Also, people sometimes compose build environments using chroot, which
at least protect them from accidental escape and corruption of the root
FS. It is a bit scary to know that a poorly designed install script
could break out of the chroot by abusing /proc or simply doing dirty
things such as "find / -follow" for any valid purpose under such an
environment.
Chroot is a useful tool for build and test environments, it's dangerous
to break it that way.
I'd clearly prefer that tasks outside the chroot show broken links
for cwd, root and exe under /proc.
