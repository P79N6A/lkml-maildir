Quite a few.  Significant ones.  pagemap_lru_lock and lru_list_lock
come to mind.

I dunno.  The spin-a-bit-then-sleep lock has always struck me as
i_dont_know_what_the_fuck_im_doing_lock().  Martin's approach puts
the decision in the hands of the programmer, rather than saying
"Oh gee I goofed" at runtime.
I need to think about all of this some more...

hmmm.
Let's back off a bit.  What are we trying to achieve here?  What
problem are we trying to solve?  Is it to allow preemptability
inside the infamous long-held locks?   If so then I'd favour
a piecemeal approach to handling each one, rather than magic
bullets.  Now it may be that certain of the locks are best handled
via a new primitive, but that's not obviously true at this time, to me.
