as a friend of mine put it on IRC:
  "Your little brains are not able to grasp the complicated issue of
  sign in comparisons."
If the problem is compiler-related, shouldn't it be forwared to the
gcc-group?
e.g.:
    : void foo() {
    : unsigned int i;
    : signed int j;
    : 
    : 	i=j;
    : }
does not generated a warning even with "-Wall". I think it should print
out something like "warning: sign will be lost in signed to unsigned
assignment".
The rules for signed/unsigned comparison should be:
 o the sign is always "sticky" (i.e. signed/unsigned -> signed)
 o data size is expanded to the size of the larger var.
 o (1) if the larger var is unsigned, data size is expanded
       even further.
   (2) if that's not possible, use carry flag.
However, I noticed that this "value-preserving arithmetic conversion"
is not always performed.
code follows:
    : #include        <stdio.h>
    : 
    : int main() {
    : 
    : unsigned char ca;
    : signed char cb;
    : 
    : unsigned short sa;
    : signed short sb;
    : 
    : unsigned int ia;
    : signed int ib;
    : 
    :         ca=0xff;
    :         cb=0xff;
    :         printf("ca=%u cb=%d\n",ca,cb);
    :         if (ca<cb) printf("ca<cb\n");
    :         else if (ca>cb) printf("ca>cb\n");
    :         else printf("ca==cb\n");
    : 
    :         sa=0xffff;
    :         sb=0xffff;
    :         printf("sa=%u sb=%hd\n",sa,sb);
    :         if (sa<sb) printf("sa<sb\n");
    :         else if (sa>sb) printf("sa>sb\n");
    :         else printf("sa==sb\n");
    : 
    :         ia=0xffffffff;
    :         ib=0xffffffff;
    :         printf("ia=%u ib=%d\n",ia,ib);
    :         if (ia<ib) printf("ia<ib\n");
    :         else if (ia>ib) printf("ia>ib\n");
    :         else printf("ia==ib\n");
    : 
    :         return 0;
    : }
will result to:
    : bash-2.03# cc -Wsign-compare -o cm cm.c
    : cm.c: In function `main':
    : cm.c:32: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
    : cm.c:33: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned
    : bash-2.03# ./cm
    : ca=255 cb=-1
    : ca>cb
    : sa=65535 sb=-1
    : sa>sb
    : ia=4294967295 ib=-1
    : ia==ib
so, in the "int" case, the result of the comparison is wrong. (shouldnt
it be expanded to long long, or at least use the carry-flag?)
If the min/max macros explicitly cast a signed data-type to an
unsigned one, the meaning of the sign-bit will be lost in any
way, not only in the int-case.
