Ah, I see.

This is a "struct device" instance without a subsystem (bus/class),
right? It will not send an uevent to userspace. Is that intended? Why
don't you add them all to the dst bus?

Yeah, a loop would look pretty ugly. How about just adding kref_set(),
if you need it.

Yeah, but if you would need to recover from an error when the creation
of a file fails, a group would do the proper "rollback".

If all devices of a subsystem (bus/class) are of the same type, you can
set a default array of attributes in the "struct bus/class" to be
created at every device. If you have multiple types of devices in the
same subsytem (bus/class) you can to assign a the "device_type", which
has the default attribute group.
That way the core will create the files before the event is sent out to
userspace, and the files can be access from the event itself. Not sure
if that is needed for dst.
