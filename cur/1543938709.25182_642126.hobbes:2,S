But you have the wrong target: it is not proprietary modules that have
this risk but those built out-of-tree without checksums.  Maybe
oopsing in this case is not so bad; or the check could just limit itself to
FORCED_MODULE.

Another way of looking at this though is that by allowing/encouraging
proprietary module writers to include markers, we and their users get
new diagnostic capabilities.  It constitutes a little bit of opening
up, which IMO we should reward rather than punish.
