The EVMS team is announcing the next stable release of the Enterprise Volume 
Management System, which will eventually become EVMS 2.0. Package 1.2.0 is 
now available for download at the project web site:
http://www.sf.net/projects/evms
EVMS 1.2.0 has full support for the 2.4 kernel, and includes patches for most
kernels up to 2.4.19. It also has nearly full support for the 2.5 kernel 
(only the OS/2 and S/390 plugins have not been ported yet), and includes a 
patch for kernels 2.5.38 and 2.5.39.
Please send any questions, problem reports or bugs to the EVMS mailing list: 
evms-devel@lists.sf.net.
