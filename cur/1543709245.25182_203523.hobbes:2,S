Clarification to the BSF/BSR behavior when source is 0.
IA-32e inherits the existing behavior, which is "if the contents source
operand are 0, the contents of the destination operand is undefined."
One needs to check the ZF to detect such a condition. The defined
behavior for 64-bit mode is consistent with the one for 32-bit mode,
i.e. if the operand size is 64-bit, the whole destination is undefined
if the contents source operand are 0.

So in this case, the lower 32 bits of the destination are undefined as
well, thus, the whole destination is undefined.
The advice is: Always check the ZF. You can use BSF/BSR with the 32-bit
operand size as long as you check the ZF.
