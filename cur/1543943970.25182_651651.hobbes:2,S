Sorry, that doesn't fix it. 
But I'm pretty sure it is related to that commit. Bisecting went
straight forward to it and reverting it fixes the bug. 
@Ray
I'm not sure you have the same problem. After waking up from s2ram, only
my fan runs at highest speed and keeps on, at least for half an hour.
All other acpi-related stuff works as usual. No sign of a stuck
ACPI-system.
Thanks,
Mirco
