Subject: Strange syslogd behavior under 2.2.10 and 2.2.11

Experiencing a strange thing with syslogd under 2.2.10 and 2.2.11 (at least
this is the first I have noticed it).  At apparently random times, the disk
starts grinding and syslogd sucks up 100% of all cpu cycles.  After about a
minute everything settles down again and the cpu usage drops down to normal
for syslogd.  But, after a short time (maybe an hour), this same thing
happens again.  Any ideas?
Thanks,
Greg
