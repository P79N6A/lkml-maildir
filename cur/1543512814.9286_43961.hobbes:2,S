There is a number of drives (dunno if Sony's are among them) which allow
setting of the compression by jumpers or dip switches to:
 - always off, software cannot change compression setting.
 - software selectable, default off after powerup.
 - software selectable, default on after powerup.
 - always on, software cannot change compression setting.
