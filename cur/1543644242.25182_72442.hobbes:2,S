People with fault injection hardware are also extremely helpful 
(assuming they do something useful with it). That's not something most 
of the community would have access to, but the CG-type people probably 
do. A couple of people who spent their full time kicking the hell out
of Sequent's fibrechannel system made a massive difference to it's
quality and reliabilty. 
That's definitely something this project could help by doing ... 
whatever people feel about the some of more theoretical aspects to 
their work being discussed, I think few would object to some real-world 
help from people tracking down and fixing existing bugs, especially in
the error handling.
