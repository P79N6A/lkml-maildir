Boy you guys make a mess of a nice email trail :(

This is not the first time we've hit this problem and presumably it won't
be the last time.
Could we do something like
#if (BITS_PER_LONG > 32) || defined(CONFIG_LBD)
#define sector_upper_32(sector) ((sector) >> 32)
#else
#define sector_upper_32(sector) (0)
#endif
and then cciss can do
-	c->Request.CDB[2]= start_blk >> 56;
+	c->Request.CDB[2]= sector_upper_32(start_blk) >> 24;
which will do the right thing.
- I think it's safer as a macro - if we make it an inline then the
  compiler might still try to evaluate the argument and will still warn
- we could do something like
  static inline sector_t sector_shifted_right_by(sector_t s, int distance)
  {
	<fancy code goes here>
  }
  But I think that won't be as generally useful as the very basic
  sector_upper_32().
- sector_upper_32() isn't a vey nice name, but it has clarity-of-purpose..
