I'd rather see them resynchronised ... in a way that makes it obvious
that they should be desynced again:
I don't know whether BIO_RW_BARRIER is __REQ_SOFTBARRIER or
__REQ_HARDBARRIER, so I didn't include that in this patch.  There also
doesn't seem to be a __REQ equivalent to BIO_RW_AHEAD, but we can do
the other four bits (and leave gaps for those two).
