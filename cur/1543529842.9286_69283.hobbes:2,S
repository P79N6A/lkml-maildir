Who said "leak memory"? named(8) uses _huge_ amounts of memory quite
legitimately, for one. Besides, "I run this as root, so I'm sure it doesn't
leak" doesn't cut it for many cluebie sysadmins (nor for quite a few
clueful ones, for that matter).

So? The non-root processes use up their allowance, the root processes eat
up the rest. What's the difference?

How do you know it is root, and not Joe Random Luser who is logging in? How
do you know root is aware of the problem, and is not just connecting in
order to fix a configuration file with emacs?
There are no easy solutions, the best you can do is to choose the victim
with some care -- but not too much, OOM is after all a extraordinary
situation, sort of "cut off your leg and you might live, or die". You don't
want to affect the normal running of the system for handling this far-out
case. Just as you don't have marks on your legs indicating where to cut ;-)
