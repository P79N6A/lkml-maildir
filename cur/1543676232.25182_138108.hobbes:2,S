Hello.
I have built a system basing on a 2.4.20 kernel.
I have two AdLink PCI7300A digital I/O boards, but AdLink only provides it 
with pre-compiled 2.4.18 modules.
I can't downgrade to 2.4.18 because my hardware (eth cards etc.) is not 
supported by this kernel.
So, does anyone know if I can get the sources for 7300A drivers? AdLink 
support keeps silence for my e-mails, so I'm a bit hopeless.
I know that there is ftp.systemy.it with some volunteers' drivers but I can't 
reach this server - maybe it doesn't wok these days at all.
Please help me if you can.
Thanks!
Artemio.
