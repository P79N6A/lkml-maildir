	Mikael's one line fix, applied to 2.3.11-pre6 has allowed me to
boot without oops successfully.  No problems after a half-hour of moderate
use.
	Patch attached below for reference.  Thanks, Mikael!
	Cheers,

Subject: fix for 2.3.11-pre6 swap_out() oops
2.3.11-pre6 locked up completely on me, shortly after boot.
A task's mm may now be NULL (but only for kernel threads I guess),
but swap_out() didn't know this --> boom! With the patch below,
my 2.3.11-pre6 is rock solid (touch wood).
