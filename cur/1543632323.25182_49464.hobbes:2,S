ok. so 0 or (NULL) is not an option, and also unnneccessary once someone
know how the error retun is used. - wouldn't it be much more cleaner
to convert this _ugly_ unsigned long vals into void * wherever these vals
are carrying an address? (well at least for do_mmap*) and use ERR_PTR
for returning, and IS_ERR for checking for an error?
btw, is err should (according to alans explaination be):
	return (unsigned long)ptr > (unsigned long)-1024UL;
	tm

in some way i do, and in some way i don't.
