OK, what do you recommend? :-)

Yes, you have right!
I try it allready, but i cannot step back enough, because my sata card works
only on 2.6.16+
Before i use the promise sata cards, and the sata 300G hdds, i use 2.6.15
kernel, and all my 4 nodes was really stable.
But this is not enough to exactly find the problem. :-(
Anyway, Hetbert Xu helps me a lot to track down the problem, but we only can
close out some thing.
If i have right, the problem is about libata, promise driver,
sata-error-handling or similar, but not so sure.
If there is no way to software debug, i will swap all the 12 hdd between 2
disk nodes, and this can show i have right, or not.
Cheers,
Janos
