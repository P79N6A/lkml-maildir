Hi,
My NEC ATAPI-PD/CD drive is working fine on kernel 2.2.3
with SCSI-emulation and "CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN".
This patch enable 'NEC ATAPI-PD user' to disable
"CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN".

Would anybody like to merge this patch with kernel source?
Or, tell me more suitable mailing list for this kind of patch.
