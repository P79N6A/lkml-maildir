Clutter, yes.  A tree-like structure can help things, and menuconfig
allows that.
That said, I don't object to hiding it in a header file, but I can
easily imagine a situation where someone would want small keys -- a very
small filesystem (flash ROM) with lots of metadata stored in a rather
deep tree without much fanout (am I using these terms properly?).  I
doubt much speed is gained by having large keys in such a situation, but
for storage space, every byte counts.
Now, the reiser4 code seems quite large compared to the space saved, but
suppose the user had chosen it already for other reasons (metadata,
space saved with cryptocompress plugin).  If reiser4 was going to be
used for any storage at all in such a situation, the user would much
rather use it for all storage than write a storage layer on top of it.
The inclusion of a (even stripped down) libdb might be the proverbial
straw that broke the camel's back.
It's possible that we will never see such a situation, but embedded
Linux is quite popular these days.
