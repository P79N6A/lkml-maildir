i believe so. We do want to manage BUG()s though, and cut down their
number once any of them becomes inactive. But a fair percentage of them
proved to be extremely useful through 2.3. This means that any assert
should live the life of a 'BUG()' line: get added with new code, and get
removed after some time.

i dont think we want to make a difference between the two. We want to
remove all BUGs over time as well (new BUG()s will be added of course).
Lets not complicate things unnecesserily.
