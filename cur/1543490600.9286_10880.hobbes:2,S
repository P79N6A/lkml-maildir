Hola Maestro's.....
Modules are wierd here. Not a single successful insmod.
#
# Loadable module support
#
CONFIG_MODULES=y
# CONFIG_MODVERSIONS is not set
# CONFIG_KMOD is not set
2.2.3 plain, 2.2.3 modules, fairly clean build, 2.1.121 modutils,
HUGE "install"-style kernel, many filesystems and HD drivers, 887k x86
bzImage, about 4 meg of .o files in /lib/modules, there _is_ a
/proc/modules,,,
$$$insmod whatever
kernel_version needed, but can't be found
No doc anywhere on what the above means, where the version is from, or why
it wants what I thought I configged it to not want. 
If modinfo puts out info at all it loops like "yes".
insmod is about the basic operator here, yes? There's no layer below that,
right? 
This is a lot of wierdness. Even for me.
