I guess what he means is that when your write to the file -- from your
editor -- it can't be considered a commit. During an editing session
you might write a dozen times, only to commit it once you are happy
(that it compiles, passes tests, etc).

If you want a dumb-ish client CVS-style, you can try git-cvsserver.
But the git model is definitely superior -- "replicating the tree on
the client" is not a workaround but a central strategy.
Have you used git and other DSCMs much? From your writing, it sounds
like you may have misunderstood how some of the principles of git work
out in practice.
