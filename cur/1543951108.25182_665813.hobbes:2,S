Yeah, the most fundamental problem is that the whole page is RO, so even 
if Xen trapped and emulated, it still makes a very bad neighbour.  I was 
also going to say that there's no reason why you couldn't pack multiple 
pgds into one page, but I think we can only specify the cr3 at page 
resolution anyway.

Hm, given that Xen doesn't make any topology guarantees about vcpus, I 
don't think it would make much difference.  I think it would only be 
observable if you actually pinned the vcpus to physical siblings.  
Besides we could easily maintain sibling info and look to see if we're 
about to reload cr3 to match the other thread(s), then just use the same 
pgd copy.
