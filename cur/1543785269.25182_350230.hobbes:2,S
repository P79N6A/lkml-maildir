Almost certainly due to bug 4851. You _really_ do not want to be using 2.6.12+ 
smp kernels on your hardware until this is sorted out. Stick to 2.6.11.12
I think this bug is going to bite a _lot_ of amd64 smp and dual core people as 
they/distros start upgrading to these newer kernels.
Andrew/Linus: you might consider including a warning in kernel release 
messages until this problem gets resolved, since it affects userland in such 
an unpredictable way and we have a good handle on which systems it affects 
(smp AMD64)
