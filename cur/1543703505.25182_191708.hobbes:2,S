It's still weird. Where is the problem to compile all controllers as
module? At runtime you still have the possibility that only one of them
can be loaded and the next one would fail to load.

To fix the menu layout it's probably the easiest to put most of it within
a "if USB_GADGET" ... "endif".

The comment confuses me, I don't see how it tests that it's "only one" of
something.

It really works fine here, are you sure you don't have any additional
changes under scripts/kconfig? Did you try this on a different machine?
