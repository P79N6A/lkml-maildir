Subject: kmalloc() with size zero

Hello,
I ran into an issue with perfmon where I ended up calling
kmalloc() with a size of zero. To my surprise, this did
not return NULL but a valid data address.
I am wondering if this is a property of kmalloc() or simply
a bug. It is the case that the __kmalloc() code does not
check for zero size.
Thanks,
