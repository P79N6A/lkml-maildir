No, what happened was on 2.6.2 all was well.  When 2.6.3 came out I got these 
timeout errors on the NIC's - but using the 2.6.2 8139too.c file in 2.6.3 
worked.  Mr Hirofumi then took up the challenge and sent me patches.  Slowly 
he resolved the issue, but the conclusion was it wasn't the code causing it.
It was an option in my BIOS PCI level/edge settings as I posted.  People on 
laptops get this error, like you, but there is no BIOS option as such... :-/
