Hmm. People _have_ given a damn, and I think you were even cc'd.
Did you take a look at the 5-patch (or was it 6?) series by Gautham R 
Shenoy <ego@in.ibm.com>? I'm cc'ing him, in case you weren't on the 
original list, and he should talk to you ;)
Right now, for 2.6.19, I'd prefer to not touch that mess unless there are 
known conditions that actually cause more problems than just stupid 
warnings..
