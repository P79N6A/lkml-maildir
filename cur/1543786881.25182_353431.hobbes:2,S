For i386, I simply let bootup code create them, and create "backup
copy" that is not damaged by any page splits... Result is in
mm/init.c:
#ifdef CONFIG_SOFTWARE_SUSPEND
/*
 * Swap suspend & friends need this for resume because things like the
intel-agp
 * driver might have split up a kernel 4MB mapping.
 */
char __nosavedata swsusp_pg_dir[PAGE_SIZE]
        __attribute__ ((aligned (PAGE_SIZE)));
static inline void save_pg_dir(void)
{
        memcpy(swsusp_pg_dir, swapper_pg_dir, PAGE_SIZE);
}
#else
static inline void save_pg_dir(void)
{
}
#endif
It is probably not as simple for x86-64 case, but some bootup code
reusal still should be neccessary...
