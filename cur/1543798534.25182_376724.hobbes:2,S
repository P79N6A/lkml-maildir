Here is a series of patches which introduce in total 11 new system calls
which take a file descriptor/filename pair instead of a single file name.
These functions, openat etc, have been discussed on numerous occasions.
They are needed to implement race-free filesystem traversal, they are
necessary to implement a virtual per-thread current working directory
(think multi-threaded backup software), etc.
We have in glibc today implementations of the interfaces which use the
/proc/self/fd magic.  But this code is rather expensive.  Here are some
results (similar to what Jim Meyering posted before):
The test creates a deep directory hierarchy on a tmpfs filesystem.
Then rm -fr is used to remove all directories.  Without syscall support
I get this:
real    0m31.921s
user    0m0.688s
sys     0m31.234s
With syscall support the results are much better:
real    0m20.699s
user    0m0.536s
sys     0m20.149s
The implemenation is really small:

I've split the patch in three parts.  The first part is the actual
code change.  It mostly consists of passing down an additional parameter
with a file descriptor and add wrapper functions which pass down the
default parameter AT_FDCWD.  Three new constants are defined in
<linux/fcntl.h> which must correspond to the values already in use
in glibc.  In a few cases I've modified some code which would not
necesarily need changing but the change makes it a bit more efficient
in presence of the wrapper functions.
The real change needed is the additional else-clause in what is now
do_path_lookup.  That's it.
The other two patches contain the syscall definitions for x86 and x86-64.
I've tested the code on x86-64, including the ia32 compat code.  Because
there is no architecture specific change all should work well on other
archs once the syscalls are added.
