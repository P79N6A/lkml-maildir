No, you right, thanks, work should be done with baseblk+i, not with i.
(It is imposible to catch on my test enviroment: size of page 4096
and baseblk always point to begin of data block which size of 
>=4096 and power of 2).
Here is patch for patch, it also contains typo fixing in previous
patch which lead to compilation failure if ufs debug turn on.
May be it is possible to integrate this patch into previous one,
or resend new version of last patch?
