The subject Cyrix chip has the "coma" bug, and attempting to boot the
2.3.10 kernel with the vesafb code enabled (vga = 791 in lilo.conf)
results in a frozen system immediately after the mode switch.  That is,
the video mode switches, but the screen goes blank and the boot process
goes no further.  I don't know that the system freeze is dependent on
the vesafb code being enabled: I simply note that the video mode switch
is the last thing seen before the freeze.
A known good workaround is to back out the 2.3.10 patch section that
removes check_cyrix_coma() from linux/include/asm-i386/bugs.h.
To the faction that believes the coma workaround should be a user space
thing, I submit that the fix is needed well before any userland process
can get a crack at the CPU :-).
