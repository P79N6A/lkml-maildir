	Both .70 and .71, with the new ACPI rev, stop booting after spitting
out the following lines (transcribed by hand):
ACPI: Subsystem revision 20030522
    ACPI-0183: *** Error: Looking up [\_SB_.PCI0.LPC_.ECP0] in namespace, AE_NOT_FOUND
    ACPI-1121: *** Error: , AE_NOT_FOUND
	dmesg from 2.5.69, lspci and .config available at:
	
http://acm.cs.nyu.edu/~tugrul/acpi/
	Otherwise, 2.5.69 is a fine release on my Compaq W8000.
