This may do PIT;)

Not long ago one could build a running kernel for Alpha w/o RTC support.
For me, RTC is not important at all *except* to configure the hwclock by
hwclock 'cause it faily badly w/o RTC module loaded;(
Well, the actual changes for the Alpha platform show me the some new way:
compile RTC _in_ or don't compile it at all. Is that right? Of course I can
do so, but since "older" kernel were fine with RTC being only a module I
really wonder about that (a bit...) (because I like modules very much;).
