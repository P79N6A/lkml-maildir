Yeah, but CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB is _really_ expensive. 
We do have a lot of very basic debug checks (unconditionally) in the 
kernel to verify various "must be true" kinds of things. It might slow 
things down a bit, but in general, I think anything that helps catch 
problems early tends to pay itself back very quickly. So I'm more than 
happy with a simple BUG_ON() in even a hot path, if it just ends up being 
compiled into a "test and branch to unlikely" and doesn't need any costly 
locking etc around it.
Fedora had DEBUG_SLAB enabled in their development kernel, and that 
actually helped a lot. But I suspect they may _not_ have it in their 
non-development ones, and those have a much bigger test-base, so it might 
well be worth it to have a good base-line that catches serious problems, 
and have DEBUG_SLAB enable the expensive tests.
It's not like trying to free a non-kmalloc'ed pointer is a really strange 
event. malloc/free bugs are some of the most common serious problems in 
user space, and I suspect they are _less_ common in the kernel, but 
still..
