Well, aren't you?  :-)

Yeah, the thought did occur to me that this is bash specific, and would
not be "portable".  But I did think that this is very Linux specific, and
I'll go with the 99% of most Linux boxes use bash.  But you are right to
complain because, like Linux, I like to be compatible with even the most
obscure setups.
When I get some more time, I'll play with some other methods, like what
Matt suggested.  But this is the quick fix for those that do use bash as
the system shell, and want it to work for their system.  Since currently,
it doesn't work for 2.6.14 from scratch.
