lib/iomap_copy.c: In function '__iowrite32_copy':
lib/iomap_copy.c:40: error: implicit declaration of function '__raw_writel'
We compile with -Werror-implicit-function-declaration, and s390 does not
have a __raw_writel.
Should it just define __raw_writel to writel, like uml does a few
commits later?
