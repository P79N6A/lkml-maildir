Am I parsing this correctly, that we actually agree on something? :-) 
I.e. that the idea of moving all the security logic to a module has merit.
Naturally, I disagree that we should remove the current LSM. The current 
version was designed to be what Linus asked for. Many LSM people like 
the idea of moving all the security logic out to a module, as it makes 
the interface much cleaner. But it is also waaay beyond the scope of 
what Linus asked for. It involves re-factoring so much code that we did 
not think it could be done correctly on the first try, never mind trying 
to get many code maintainers to accept much larger patches.
