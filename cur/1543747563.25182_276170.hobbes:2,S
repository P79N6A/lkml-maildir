Random side thoughts..
a) is there a simple way to search for symbols in a running kernel's 
memory area that
b) can differentiate between module and static, and if so
c) is there an interest in a tiny tool that scripts  could use to 
determine existing support?
I want to be able to request information about a whooplesnoople without 
it triggering a module load request, to determine if it's compiled in 
statically.  I want to be able to distinguish static a static 
whooplesnoople from a modularly loaded whooplesnoople.
i.e.
Scott ~$ kernfunctionexists "iptables"
builtin
Other possible values:
module
not found
The tool would do the work of doing a lookup on "iptables" to match it 
with a certain name.  I.e "irda" would be resolved to a known proper 
irda_function_name() value.
The purpose of this is not to be able to research any given function 
name in the kernel, but to look for major support functions such as 
iptables.
