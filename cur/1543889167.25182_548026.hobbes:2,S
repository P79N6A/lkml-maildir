I guess we have different views on "simple" :)
I had a look at the usb code, which is why I think the current method is
a bit indirect. Right now I instead copied the function that adds the
device attributes given in the bus_type structure. Couldn't that be used
in a more general manner to get device attribute groups?

I take it I can supply an array of groups somewhere?
