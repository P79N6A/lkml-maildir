yes.

No, I experience both freeze during nfs-only action and freeze during
tar-to-scsi-tape.
My feelings are that the freeze does (at least in the nfs case) not happen
during high load but rather when load seems relatively light. Handwaving one
could say it looks rather like an I/O sched starvation issue than breakdown
during high load. Similar to the last issue.

Well, I really tried hard to produce something, but failed so far, if I had
more time I would try a serial console hoping that it survives long enough to
show at least _something_.
The only thing I ever could see was the BUG in page-alloc thing from the
beginning of this thread.
