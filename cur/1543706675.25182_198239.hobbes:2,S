Oh, I wasn't thinking of fixing *every* application out there, but making
the kernel api's convert between the user locale and the file system locale,
thus restricting the problems to places that can be fixed.
An alternative would be glibc since it's used by most apps, but then there
could be funny and inefficient interactions with filesystems that already
do the job. The "future" common case would be utf-utf conversion for all
native file systems, i.e. no work.

Some applications break if I put any non-ascii characters, but they few
enough that I can afford the loss. Most shell scripts break if I even have
a space in a filename.  This shouldn't be any worse than that. The space
issue is really serious (but I don't think that can be fixed other than teaching
people to program properly, and possibly improving bash's knowledge of the 
difference between a space and argument separator).
