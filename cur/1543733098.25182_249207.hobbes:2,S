SGI doesn't so assume ;).

I agree.  That's what my cpumask sizing loop does.
Well ... did.
Now it reads /sys/devices/system/node/node0/cpumap and computes the
size of the cpumask as an arithmetic function of the number of bytes
read (the ascii format uses 9 chars for each 32 bits of mask).
Either way works ...
My nodemask sizing code loops on get_mempolicy() calls of increasing
size, until they stop failing -EINVAL.

I'm not sure what history you're looking at here, Linus.
Last weeks sys_sched_setaffinity didn't seem to require matching size,
only that user size is >= kernel size.  The kernel ignored the extra
user bits.
For nodemask_t, well let me just say the mbind/mempolicy calls are different.
If we want to go in the direction of requiring sizes to match in the
'set' calls, then instead of this weeks changes to sys_sched_setaffinity
allowing user size < kernel size, shouldn't we be going the other way,
and tightening the check in kernel/sched.c:sys_sched_setaffinity(), from
what it was a week ago:
        if (len < sizeof(new_mask))
                return -EINVAL;
to:
        if (len != sizeof(new_mask))
                return -EINVAL;
Or at least reverting this last weeks changes back to the '<' check?

How about:
	$ cd /proc/sys/kernel
	$ head sizeof*
	==> sizeof_cpumask <==
	64
	==> sizeof_nodemask <==
	32
