It races against things like a third party haungup of the controlling
tty session if the lock is not held.

You would still want memory barriers and to audit the time things took
effect as there is a fairly defined ordering involved here. Fully
refcounting ttys would not be a bad thing but would require some driver
work because the driver level objects hung off a tty are often not
dynamically allocated and are not themselves refcounted so would get
corrupted if the tty object was freed and a new one allocated and opened
in the meantime.
