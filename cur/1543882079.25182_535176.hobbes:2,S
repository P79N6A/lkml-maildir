Well maybe you could explain what you want. Preferably without redefining 
the established terms?

I have not heard of any alternatives in this discussion here. Just the old 
line of lets tune the VM here and there and hope it lasts a while longer.

Because 4k is a good page size that is bound to the binary format? Frankly 
there is no point in having my text files in large page sizes. However, 
when I read a dvd then I may want to transfer 64k chunks or when use my 
flash drive I may want to transfer 128k chunks. And yes if a scientific 
application needs to do data dump then it should be able to use very high 
page sizes (megabytes, gigabytes) to be able to continue its work while 
the huge dumps runs at full I/O speed ...
