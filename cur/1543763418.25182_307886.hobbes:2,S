Subject: [PATCH] the MPU/noMMU support for ARM Linux 2.6.11.6 (-hsc0)

Greetings,
I'm glad to announce the MPU and noMMU support patch for ARM against
2.6.11.6 at:
http://opensrc.sec.samsung.com/download/linux-2.6.11.6-hsc0.patch.gz
Actually the patch was "armnommu" architecture patch by 2.6.9, but it is
just merged into "arm" architecture, and provides selection option, "MMU"
for linux and "MPU", "NONE" for uclinux. It means that you can choose "MMU"
or even "NONE" for your MMU based arm platform with a few modification (i.e.
virtual addr --> physical addr), if you want to use "singular address space"
which is proven to have performance improvement. (I'd like to provide some
benchmark result on same h/w platform for both cases.)
some addtional MPU support API is pending to support new features like
memory protection for uclinux, but I need more suggestions on that.
You can reach the project at : 
http://opensrc.sec.samsung.com/
currently officially supported platforms are : s3c24a0, s5c7375, atmel,
espd_s3c510b, P2001, s3c3410, s3cb0x.
Best Regards,
Hyok
