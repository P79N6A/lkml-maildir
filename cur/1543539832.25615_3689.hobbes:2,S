	That depends, are you talking about just filtering the known 'bad'
things, or filtering down to where only valid commands (with valid data
mind you, which is a cute thing to try and determine in kernel space) work?
	Not that it really matter much, both lead to the dark side and loads
of cruft that will never be cleaned out, even once the hardware is fixed and
such filtering of 'invalid' commands with 'invalid' data, or valid commands
with 'invalid' data is useless.
