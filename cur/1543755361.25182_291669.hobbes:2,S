Hi,
I compiled kernel 2.4.21 with intel compiler .
While booting it hangs-up . further i found that it
hangsup due to call to "calibrate_delay" routine in
"init/main.c". Also found that loop in the
callibrate_delay" routine goes infinite.When i comment
out the call to "callibrate_delay" routine, it works
fine.Even compiling "init/main.c" with "-O0" works
fine. I am using IA-64 (Intel Itanium 2 ) with EL3.0.
Any pointers will be great help.
Thanks,
-Baswaraj
