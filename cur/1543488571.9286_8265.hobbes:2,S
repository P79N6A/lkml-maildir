  Hi, all. Version 93 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This is against 2.2.2. Highlights of this release:
- Modified <sd_name> in drivers/scsi/sd.c to cope with devices that
  don't exist (which happens with new RAID autostart code printk()s)
				Regards,
					Richard....
