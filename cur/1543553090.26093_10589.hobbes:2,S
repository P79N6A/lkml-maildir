It does.  Read the patch.  LINK_FIRST *itself* is not sorted.

Indeed, the right solution is
  LINK_FIRST := a.o z.o f.o p.o
which is self-documenting, as Keith has said: by looking at that line,
the intended behavior is obvious.  You should still accompany this with
a comment explaining *why* the ordering is needed, but even if you
don't, you are giving us much more information than the status quo
(which is "this link order works, any other order is quite possibly
sane but who knows for sure").
