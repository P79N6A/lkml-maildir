DVD drives functions as normal CD-ROM drives, so it works with the
standard drivers too.

Yes, that shouldn't be a problem.

There will be, I am working on it. I think you have things a little
confused, though, so I'll try and explain it a bit.
A DVD drive is works as a normal CD-ROM drive, in that it understands
the same commands. In addition to those, DVD drives support a number
of new commands. However, those are only needed for special DVD software.

Yes, the same rules apply to CD-RW devices.

Shouldn't matter all that much. To keep it simple, set the bootable
drive as master on the primary channel. The other devices don't have
to be in any order.
