Following up on myself, here are some numbers:
Freshly booted 2.4.4 with X and Mozilla running, 'free' outputs this:
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:         62716      61280       1436          0       1820      28704
-/+ buffers/cache:      30756      31960
Swap:       160608          0     160608
Freshly booted 2.4.5-ac2 with X and Mozilla running, 'free' outputs this:
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:         62784      61784       1000        380       1824      35748
-/+ buffers/cache:      24212      38572
Swap:       160608       7128     153480
After running 2.4.5-ac2 (and other kernels after vanilla 2.4.4) for a while
the swap usage grows a lot, to around 60 MB. Older kernels didn't swap out
this aggressively in my experience.
This is on a 233 Mhz box with 64 megs of RAM.
