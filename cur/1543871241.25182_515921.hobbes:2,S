 Sounds like a distro problem.  In particular, distros add patches
and use different configs.  My ibook G4 has been running 2.6.20-rc4
since about January 8th without any issues, but I can remember that
it took me a very long time to come up with a .config which worked
for me after the move to arch/powerpc.  If your graphics card is a
radeon, I can send you my .config off-list if you think that will
help.
