The sane solution seems to be to enable SYSFS_DEPRECATED unconditionally 
for all users, and schedule it's removal for mid-2008 (or later).
12 months after the first _release_ of a HAL that can live without seems 
to be the first time when we can consider getting rid of it, since all 
distributions with at least one release a year should ship it by then.
Currently, SYSFS_DEPRECATED is only a trap for users.
Suggested patch below.

unconditionally enable SYSFS_DEPRECATED
This patch unconditionally enables SYSFS_DEPRECATED and schedules it's
removal for July 2008.
Currently, SYSFS_DEPRECATED is only a trap for users accidentally
disabling it.
In July 2008, all distributions with at least one release a year should
be able to run without SYSFS_DEPRECATED.
