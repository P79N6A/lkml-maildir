Yes, I need to clean this up.  There are a couple other places where I 
took liberties and just did things that way because this was how our 
VMware ROM was implemented.  Just be sure, if you are going to implement 
a ROM, it has to be GPL'd now, otherwise the VMI code won't accept it.

It passes test level 1, which is good enough to make it into my patchset.
