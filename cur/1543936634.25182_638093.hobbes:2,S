The gpiolib isn't merged yet and it's purpose it to let use any gpio in the
system independently of how they are connected (directly, or through spi, ...).
So I don't use it!

Okay, so what do you do with this single pin?

Sure. Another solution is to make add a .type in the gpio_wdt struct to choose
which function to use for keepalive -> support for more chips in the driver
itself.

I just had a look at it. It has additionnal restrictions like 'It should not
be triggered more often than 1.6 seconds', ..., and works with a timer, it
is really very differrent of what I'm doing...
Can you please tell me what is connected to this gpio?

Me too :)
