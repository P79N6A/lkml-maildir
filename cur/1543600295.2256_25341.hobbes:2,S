Yes I agree that's not easy and certainly not the goal to avoid this kind
of thing.
Btw I was thinking about a real case: I use in my laptop the lucent driver
for their winmodem chipset. This driver is closed source but we use it
relinked with proper opensource code. This avoid the use of 'insmod -f' and
most of the bug (caused by missing symbols) but you can not trust the
resulting module.
