Yeah, my patch was 100% harmless.

That layer can not be built properly:
  Normal systems dump core on 11 signals.
  Linux dumps core on only 6 signals.
This can not be fixed really. Maybe just change 5 random signals?
Nobody can know which ones may be changed. The kernel source contains
no hint beyond the existing signals. I do not ever expect glibc to
define the signals, since the potential for conflict is great.
-----
I've seen plenty of people wonder if they should bother hacking, since
they are afraid that thier patches will be rejected. This is bad.
I have a feeling that a UNIX v6 filesystem would be rejected, so why
would I bother to write it?
In many parts of the world, conflict is not tolerated well. There people
are totally excluded. It is as if patch submission required violence.
The shy are not welcome here. They may be great hackers, but hey,
they suck dude! Right? Nobody likes them anyway.
I'm sick of seeing behavior on linux-kernel that looks like Slashdot
behavior. (
http://slashdot.org
) Such behavior is harmful.

The distinction is arbitrary. There is a risk-cost tradeoff to be made
for everything. We might not like to admit it, but even when human life
could be lost... there are finite financial resources.
