Stephen, here is what is going to happen if we apply your patch.
The default window scale will be 2, which is under the value which
starts to cause the problems which is 3.
So things will silently work, and most people will not notice the
problem.
I'd much rather bugs scream out saying "I'm a bug fix me!" than to
just silently linger around mostly unnoticed.
