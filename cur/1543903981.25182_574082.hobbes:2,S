Subject: [PATCH 0/3] More ISDN hotplug/probe conversions (kill pci_find_device)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The following three patches continue the development work found on the
'isdn-pci' branch of
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jgarzik/misc-2.6.git
which currently contains the following changes:
      [ISDN] HiSax: modularize card setup
      [ISDN] Ready HiSax driver for modularization
      [ISDN] HiSax bkm_a4t: convert to PCI hotplug API
      [ISDN] HiSax enternow: convert to PCI hotplug API
      [ISDN] HiSax hfc_pci, w6692: convert to PCI hotplug API
      [ISDN] HiSax nj_s, nj_u: convert to PCI hotplug API
      [ISDN] HiSax telespci: convert to PCI hotplug API
P     [ISDN] HiSax: additional export to make things proper
1 --> [ISDN] HiSax avm_pci: split setup into three smaller functions
2 --> [ISDN] HiSax avm_pci: convert to modern probing
2 --> [ISDN] HiSax acm_pci: fix module unload
3 --> [ISDN] HiSax gazel: convert to ISA/PCI new probing
The three patches' contents are the final four changesets listed.
These new patches begin to convert drivers that are not exclusively
PCI-only, complicating things a bit.
