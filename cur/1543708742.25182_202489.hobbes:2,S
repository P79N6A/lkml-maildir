Not sure what was failing on Arief# laptop, here it works perfectly
fine. Hardware: Compaq EVO N800v, kernel 2.6.3 , frambuffer and 
UseFBDev "true" just fine. 
Without UseFBDev console had almost the same effects Arief has reported.
After "clear screen" ^L in console with X running in background, I see a
lot of artifacts ... UseFBDev made it go away.
