I use standard kernel. Modules usually loaded while I run kde are: soundcore, sound, sb, sb_lib, opl3, uart401, isa-pnp, apm
tdfx, 
Perhaps usbcore && usb-ohci were loaded, too.
Chipset is SIS 5571, ide chipset SIS 5513. I've some problems with
latest updates about SIS Ide driver update: When I sleep the drive with
hdparm -Y /dev/hda
then the drive sleeps. But it doesn't 'awake'. I can do 'Login: XXX \n Password: XXX' or write a command
in the shell. But when the unit has to read/write, it just does nothing.
Latest kernels without this patch (2.4.18-preX....) did something different:
I could sleep drive normally. But when the system had to read/write something:
Feb 15 18:13:08 localhost kernel: hda: timeout waiting for DMA
Feb 15 18:13:08 localhost kernel: ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_timeout func only: 14
Feb 15 18:13:08 localhost kernel: hda: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
Feb 15 18:13:08 localhost kernel: hda: drive not ready for command
Feb 15 18:13:08 localhost kernel: ide0: reset: success
The system just stopped a few seconds, and then it started as always.
Drive was tuned with hdparm with the following options:
/sbin/hdparm -c3 -A1 -a8 -d1 -m16 -p4 -u1 -W1 -X34 /dev/hda
I'll copy all this about SIS IDE driver in a new post, so all people interested will be able to read about it.
