The trivial pci_set_power_state issue aside, resume is currently
defective with the new firewire-ohci driver:
  - The version in Linus' tree doesn't restore a certain detail of
    IEEE 1394 state during resume, hence some protocols like SBP-2 don't
    work after resume unless you unload and reload the drivers.
  - The version in -mm restores everything but panics soon after resume
    on an APM notebook in combination with some SBP-2 targets.  I have
    yet to try netconsole or so to gather more information.
