Only a single thread, single flow setup. Very primitive but simple.

Already doing the single file, single process. However, i do run by time
which means i could read the file from the begining(offset 0) to the end
then re-do it for as many times as 15secs would allow. Does this affect
it? I tried one 1.5 GB file, it was oopsing and given my setup right now i
cant trace it. So i am using about 170M which is read about 8 times in
the 15 secs
cheers,
