*high* ? he never goes far beyond 1000/s !

quite possibly, but I'd rather think it's more precisely related
to the ping-pong in the scheduler between grep, cut and ssh. I
had the same symptom with 'ls' in xterm with lots of files. It
took tens of seconds to list 2000 files while 'ls |cat' gave
the same result instantly.
I also have another example (2.6.15-rc5, dual athlon, logged in
via SSH) :
  willy@pcw:willy$ time ls -l
  real    0m0.150s
  user    0m0.016s
  sys     0m0.024s
Now if I start 4 processes in background :
  willy@pcw:willy$ time ls -l
  real    0m4.432s
  user    0m0.028s
  sys     0m0.008s
With 8 processes in background :
  willy@pcw:willy$ time ls -l
  real    0m49.817s
  user    0m0.020s
  sys     0m0.008s
  willy@pcw:willy$ time ls -l | wc -l
     1259
  real    0m18.917s
  user    0m0.016s
  sys     0m0.012s
I think my case with 4 processes on a dual CPU ressembles Grant's case
with 2 processes on single CPU. The background processes are only ones
which eat CPU half of their time, which might sometimes match an I/O
bound process such as grep from a disk.

I don't think so.
