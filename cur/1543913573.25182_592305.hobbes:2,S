smp_rmb() should not need to do anything because loads are done
in order anyway. Both AMD and Intel have committed to this now.
The important point is that they *appear* to be done in order. AFAIK,
the CPUs can still do speculative and out of order loads, but throw
out the results if they could be wrong.
