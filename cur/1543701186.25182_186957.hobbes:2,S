First of all, thanks for the help, my problem is now solved, and it's good to
see the patch you sent so used just have to pass psmouse_proto=... to the
kernel whenever they compiled it as a module or built-in in the kernel.
However the question is still there... I mean: I now know the sollution because
I asked here on lkml, and now I understand what's really happening, but if the
target is to get the work easy for those upgrading from 2.4, then you're
failing... I mean, for those who are in the same sittuation than me they will
just stop having the mouse tap feature with the kernel update, so why don't
just make the psmouse_proto={bare|imps|exps} argument selectable in the kernel
configuration?
Once again, maybe there's something more that I can't see here, but makes
pretty much more sense to me people have to do the choice while compiling the
kernel than having no choice and then having to pass an argument to the
kernel...
Please take that into consideration,
My best regards and keep the good work,
