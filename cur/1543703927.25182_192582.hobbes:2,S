CPU context ? I don't think swsusp needs anything different than
suspend-to-RAM in this regard (at least the pmac version of suspend-to
-RAM that wakes up on a CPU reset). The CPU setup will be saved as part
of the kernel data and will be restored after the pages are back in
place the same way it is restored when waking up from RAM. The code
is already there (and actually, that ppc port of swsusp borrowed it).
