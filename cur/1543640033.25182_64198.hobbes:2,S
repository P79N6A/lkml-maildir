I think it's worth the effort.  Especially if IBM wants to keep the 32 (31)bit
port alife long-term.  Having two codebases that are mostly the same doesn't
sound like a good idea for fix propagation to me.

How much documentation outside the kernel tree knows about it?

I think it's a good idea but don't understand the compiler depency.  Why
do you need asm-s390 and asm-s390x to be the same to have an compiler that
works for 32bit and 64bit mode?  Today e.g. the sparc and x86 compilers
can support both modes with very different kernel headers.
I don't see how you want to make the s390x port refer to include/asm-s390
easily when ARCH is still s390x..
