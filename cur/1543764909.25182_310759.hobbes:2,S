    Troy> Do we even need the mlock in userspace then?
Yes, because the kernel may go through and unmap pages from userspace
while trying to swap.  Since we have the page locked in the kernel,
the physical page won't go anywhere, but userspace might end up with a
different page mapped at the same virtual address.
