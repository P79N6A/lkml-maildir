Hi,
on a dual Pentium-mmx 233Mhz box (I got for free ...) I get many APIC
errors, like:
APIC error on CPU1: 08(00)
APIC error on CPU0: 02(00)
... ...
I also sometimes got 04(00).
Those errors only seem to happen during high disk-io (SCSI or IDE).
What specific meaning do those errors have? Are they dangerous?
Each CPU survives hours in memtest86 ... And with maxcpus=1 it also
does not seem to happen ... The BIOS is latest.
Sincerely,
  René Rebe
