will mlock() automatically cause all pages to be read from the file ?
(I don't think)
But since I already do an mlockall() at the beginnig, there is no need of
additional mlock()s
I had an additional idea: mmap()ing the data directly into the circular-buffer
and dirty the pages through writing one word for each page, it might be a
bit faster, because you avoid a memcpy() , but
the problem is that since the audio thread acesses this buffer, I have to
implement some communication to signal the disk thread to unmap the region,
or alternatively keep track of previously mapped regions in the disk thread,
which makes things more complicated.
I'm dealing with a data rate of about 5MB/sec (from disk), therefore the main
bottleneck is the disk not the memcpy() performance.
But I will try to mmap()/munmap() tracking and mmap() directly into the
circular-buffer, let's see if I can lower the CPU load of an additional 1-2%.
:-)
BTW, does anyone know the best method to measure the real % of CPU idle time,
since top is pretty unreliabe.

This will be nice, similar to O_DIRECT performance,
I will use whatever comes first.
