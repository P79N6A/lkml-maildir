Of course it can. See below.

Sure. Same for irqs.

Sure you can.
I was talking about running on the _cpus_ that belong to the "sets A and B but 
not C" and not that a task must belong to more than one cpuset. Unless I 
misinterpreted your example you were talking about exact same thing. In other 
words that an irq needs to assigned to the _cpus_ in the sets A and B but not C.
Makes sense ?
