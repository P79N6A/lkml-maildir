Heh. What a polite way of saying that you think I'm full of sh*t ;)

No.
What it means, though, is that we did finish what we set out to do.
Nothing more.

Well, refill-inactive really relies on the assumption that _some_ progress
was made, which was certainly true. "swap_out()" returning 1 has not
actually meant that a page has been free'd for a _long_ long time: it's
meant that _something_ changed (ie "we added one page to the swap cache"
or similar).
I agree that the return value of swap_out() is fairly meaningless. It's
been fairly meaningless for a long time now, and it's entirely possible
that the "while (swap_out())" loop should be just something like
	/* Scan the VM space, try to clean up the page tables a bit */
	for (i = 0 ; i <= nr_threads >> priority; i++)
		swap_out(gfp_mask);
which just tries to move pages out of the page tables, so that the _real_
page freeing logic (ie page_launder() and friends) have more to work with.
This is especially true these days as swap_out() really doesn't do any IO
at all (and has thus finally become completely misnamed: it's not so much
swapping stuff out, as just aging the page tables).
As it is, I think that the above is fairly close to what the code
effectively ends up actually _doing_. Even if it's not really written that
way.
