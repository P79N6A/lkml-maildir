In theory.  In practice, from having dealt with enough PXE stacks, I
would say that it is more likely you're going to have problems getting
the UNDI drivers to work in a Linux environment than you will find
that a fully equipped kernel lacks the drivers you need, especially
since you can update the kernel on the server as needed.  There has
been a shakeout in the NIC world, and aren't anywhere near as many in
use now as there was a few years ago -- and anything before then isn't
going to have PXE.
