The ICH8 south-bridge I have is the mobile variant and does come
equipped with native parallel IDE - see page 447:
http://download.intel.com/design/chipsets/datashts/31305603.pdf
 . I do
see 35MB/s with DMA enabled from my CF on the 1 in 15 times the
libata-kernel does work.
I can dump off and decode the configuration registers for the timing
and bus master registers in the working and non-working libata cases,
and the legacy ATA working case and see what's different.
