make it _ALOT_ more clear that mere mortals should not touch this 
option! Also, you do not mention the userspace-VM fragmentation issues.  
Plus, if a user uses a 2G/2G split with more than 2G of RAM, the kernel 
should print a warning that it's running with a non-default split. Do 
the same if the user uses a non-default split with less than 960MB of 
RAM.

it's not 'will' but 'may', and even then, tons of .config things can 
break bin-only modules, so just skip this paragraph.
looks good to me otherwise, with the text fixes it's:
