Throwing in my $.02.  /etc/rc.d/* seems to have 100 levels (00 through 
99) and it (so far) appears to be pretty sane, from my perspective. 
 While 100 levels are perhaps too many, would it be more reasonable to 
have, say _early_initcall, _initcall, and _late_initcall for each of the 
categories (arch, fs, device, etc.)?  This would allow more granularity 
within levels so things needn't ever be improperly promoted out of their 
rightly-named level.  Prolly not, just thought I'd ask.
