  I tried pre15 this morning before I left the house and it was hanging
when it was scanning my SCSI CD-ROM (YAMAHA CRW4416S), even though it got
the two hard-drives correctly.  pre14 doesn't do that.  Rebooted twice
with the same results.  Same compile options, although I haven't looked
into it in a huge amount of details yet.
  Adaptec AIC-7890 Ultra2 SCSI host adapter, no extra patches.
