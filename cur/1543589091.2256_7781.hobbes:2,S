Hi!
Has anybody used binfmt_misc on 2.4.3-ac14? It fails for me:
echo ':py:E::py::/opt/bin/python:' > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register
bash: /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register: No such file or directory
The directory /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/ exists, but nothing in it.
2.4.3 kernel built with exactly the same settings works flawlessly.
Btw: it's RH 7.0, but I've compiled on kgcc (announcing itself as
egcs-2.91.66)
Thanks and best regards
