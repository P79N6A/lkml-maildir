No strong preference here but I think that it should be drivers/ata/ since it
is updated more frequently (NCQ etc).  Either way there needs to be a BIG FAT
comment at the top of the file explaining that the file is used by both IDE
and SCSI/libata subsystems.
For the new file (i.e. ata-quirks) to be a shared library it needs to be
similar to libraries from lib/ (ie. lib/crc16c).  After some thought I'm
convinced that it is an optimal solution.  It allows the real code sharing
and at the same time it is the simplest when it comes to the build rules.
Of course I can be missing something really obvious which would prevent
this scheme from working...  :)

Lets assume that the new config entry will be CONFIG_ATA_QUIRKS
and that it shouldn't be visible during kernel configuration.
* drivers/ata/Kconfig:
menuconfig ATA should select ATA_QUIRKS
...
config ATA_QUIRKS
	tristate
	depends on ATA || BLK_DEV_IDE
* drivers/ide/Kconfig:
config BLK_DEV_IDEDMA should select ATA_QUIRKS
Or something similar... now to the Makefile modifications...
* drivers/ata/Makefile:
Add rule for obj-$(CONFIG_ATA_QUIRKS) at the top of the file.
* drivers/Makefile:
Replace obj-$(CONFIG_ATA) with obj-y (so ata-quirks library
gets compiled even if it is selected only by IDE subsystem).
Since ata-quirks is a stand-alone module the kernel build
system should take care of the rest.

Not a real issue, I'm not aware of any out of tree IDE drivers.

Add ATA_HORKAGE_DMA_OK and add drive_whitelist[] entries back to
ata_device_blacklist[]?  Unless somebody has a better idea...

Thanks, all three patches were applied.
