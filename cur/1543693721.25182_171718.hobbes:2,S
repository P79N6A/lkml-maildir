Hi,
good news. Broadcom/Linksys finally decided to provide all sources. I
haven't checked everything but it looks like everything is there. Don't know
if they did it by accident but they even donated more ... including the
bootloader, ethernet driver and lots of other non-gpl'ed stuff. Interesting
change of attitude. I'm sure one day i'll ask them for the source of the
(modified) toolchain which they distribute binary only inside this
package... but for now i'm happy :-)
Thanks for all the people that supported us. Thanks Broadcom/Linksys for
finally come to the conclusion that working together with the community is
much more effective than working against us. Thanks!
Regards,
   Florian
