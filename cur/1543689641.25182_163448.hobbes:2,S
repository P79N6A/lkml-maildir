The problem is that unit-at-a-time sees all functions used and finds
some static functions/variables that are not called anywhere and
therefore drops them, making a smaller binary.  Since GCC does not
look into inline assembler, anything referenced from inline assembler
only, will be treated as not used and therefore removed.
You have to options:
- use attribute ((used)) (implemented since GCC 3.2) to tell GCC that
  a function/variable should never be removed
- use -fno-unit-at-a-time.
Since unit-at-a-time has better inlining heuristics the better way is
to add the used attribute - but that takes some time.  The short-term
solution would be to add the compiler flag,
Andreas
