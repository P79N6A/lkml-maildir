I got this error without starting any tv application:
saa7134[0]/irq[10,4251666]: r=0x20 s=0x00 PE
saa7134[0]/irq: looping -- clearing PE (parity error!) enable bit
I don't know when it exactly occurs, it was there in dmesg after a few hours 
the machine was running. (btw, no cable was connected to the card).
card related info:
$ dmesg | grep saa
