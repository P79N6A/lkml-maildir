I had a look in var/log/dmesg of a good boot, and that stops logging
when all the partitions are up.  The command "dmesg" goes a little
further and includes the agpgart and drm along with eth0 etc., but
I can't run _that_ on the failed pre4 'cause it reboots instantly.
The last line of /var/log/messages before "restart" for the failed
boot would normally be followed by messages on the start of agpgart
followed by drm.
There is a little in the ksymoops, "start modprobe agpgart safemode=0"
followed by the first line of the next boot.
I forgot to mention before, I'm running ext3, and the Matrox drivers
from 28 Feb 02 (current) on essentially a RedHat 7.3, but with gcc 3.2
Any other logging I could set up?
