btw, this is not only x86 behaviour but is also true on all other
architectures. I.e. Linux defines "shared memory" as a "integer constant
with value 0". So, to say "zero" is just a shorter form of saying "Linux
concept of shared memory". However, remember that if you are interested in
shared _pages_, that information is available and is not identically 0.
See the show_mem() function in arch/i386/mm/init.c.

No, PAGE_SIZE is known at compile time and cannot ever change (especially
it cannot change ig you stay within i386 architecture). It is available to
programs by including <asm/page.h> header.
