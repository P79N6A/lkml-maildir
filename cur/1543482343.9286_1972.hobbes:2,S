I did make some reports.  The first 2.2.0pre that I tried, failed
just after "Loading devel...." before the "Uncompressing"
message.  Other pre's went half way through the kernel startup,
the last couple pre's made it to the "can't load init" stage.  I
wrote at least 1 or two messages about it.
I don't know if it was a kernel fault, or my fault.  It is
perfectly possible that I did something wrong myself.

Hmm.  Strange.  The /dev/hdb6 is the one that I wanted, so you
are correct that there is a typo there, but my /dev/hda6 is also
a linux root fs that is bootable too.  I can boot RedHat 5.2 off
/dev/hda6 with 2.0.36, and I can boot RedHat 5.1 off /dev/hdb6
with 2.0.36.  2.2.0 wouldn't boot on either, but I'll try
changing the typo and see what happens.  I just checked my RH 5.2
lilo.conf and it does not have a typo strangely enough.

Thanks for your help.  I will fix my lilo.conf, and try to boot
once again.  If it fails, I'll post back another report.
