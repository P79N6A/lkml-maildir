the main reason for that i explained in the portion of the email you

of course it's easy to have static markup that is usable for both types 
of tracers - but that is of little use. Static tracers also need the 
guarantee of a _full set_ of static markups. It is that _guarantee_ of a 
full set that i'm arguing against primarily. Without that guarantee it's 
useless to have markups that can be used by static tracers as well: you 
wont get a full set of tracepoints and the end-user will complain. 
(partial static markups are of course still very useful to dynamic 
tracers)
( furthermore, there are other reasons as well: i explained my position 
  in some of those replies that you did not want to "further dvelve 
  into". I'm happy to give you Message-IDs if you'd like to follow up on 
  them, there's no need to repeat them here. )
