Hello Seokmann,
I would like to tell you that your patch is wrong, at least for
 MegaRAID SATA 150-4 RAID Controller
06:02.0 RAID bus controller: LSI Logic / Symbios Logic MegaRAID (rev 01)

As far as I see the 64-bit magic is set, pci(0xA4) == 0x0299 and driver tries to
enable 64-bit DMA. However the controller is not supported 64-bit DMA, and I
still have the same error messages.
Could you please check this issue and update your patch properly.
Thank you,
