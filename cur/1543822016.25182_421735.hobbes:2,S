Most Intel chipset do not really have the hardware RNG - PCI ID
matches, but the check for INTEL_RNG_PRESENT bit in intel_init()
fails.  (In fact, I have not ever seen a board which had that RNG.)

All that logic in hwrng_register() and hwrng_unregister() looks overly
complex.  Maybe we should just register the miscdevice
unconditionally, and make it return -ENODEV from open() if no RNG is
registered?
