Subject: [PATCH] more NLS for ncpfs & vfat
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi,
I have implemented utf8 translation, escape sequences and Unicode based
case conversion in the NLS part of ncpfs file system.
I have also updated my patch for vfat file system for using escape
sequences like ncpfs. This solves a problem for comparing file names
including old vfat escape squences and fixes the 'invalid argument' bug in
addition. It's tested with Gordon Chaffee's test-suite.
All patches are to find under
http://www.bsz.shk.th.schule.de/download/linux/.
Comments are welcome.
Best regards,
Wolfram
