Subject: [PATCH] unless signed chg cannot become less than 0
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/18/65

region_chg returns long, so let vma_needs_reservation() forward this to
alloc_huge_page(). and do not store it in an unsigned, since a negative
will go unnoticed. Store it as long as well. all callers treat it as
long anyway.
