The level. see linux/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt
Also worth looking at is

I presume you don't want to actually measure traffic throughput
as there are obviously other ways to do this.

yes that's the idea.

Also note CONFIG_NET_PROFILE=Y which writes more network specific
profile data to /proc/net/profile, which you'll have to figure
out how to parse.
Also I think it was reported that there were some problems
with profiling (missing symbols) around 2.5.8? I don't know
whether it's been fixed.
Also I don't think you can profile modules, but there was a patch...
