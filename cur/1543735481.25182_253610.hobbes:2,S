Not just incomplete and confusing, but actively wrong.  spin_lock/
spin_unlock should imply ordering of readb().  What you're describing
there is __readb().  See Documentation/DocBook/deviceiobook.tmpl.  Also,
rmb() should ensure ordering of io reads; there should be no need to
touch the device.

the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
