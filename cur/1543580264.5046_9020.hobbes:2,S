Well, my GigE card does that too. Not with TCP, though :)

What I get is 102MB/s with 4% CPU use on a dual pIII/500 32/66 box sending to
a dual pII/450 32/33 box (about 10M/s less the other way around, so 
I'm assuming I'd get somewhat more with real 64/66 PCI buses on both 
machines)

Or you can buy an Alteon-based Netgear 620 for under $300. It all 
depends on your budget and needs :)
