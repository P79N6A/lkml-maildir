Hello Davide,
thanks for fast reply and effort.
I have tested your patch with patched and unpatched 2.6.28.2 kernel.
The outputs are attached. The patched kernel passes all your tests.
But I have bad news. My library code does not fall into busy loop
after your patching but my FIFO tests do not work even in
single level epoll scenario. The strace output is attached as well.
I try to do more testing tomorrow. I have returned from weekend trip
at the evening today and I have not much time for deeper analysis.
But it looks like write level sensitive events are not triggering
for epoll at all. The pipe is not fill by any character and specified
timeout is triggered with next message as fail results.
  @ pipe #X evptrig wr timeout
  @ pipe #X evptrig rd timeout
If you want to test the code on your box, download library
http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~pisa/ulan/ul_evpoll-090123.tar.gz
The simple "make" in the top directory should work.
Then you can test correct behavior with sysvpoll default events
monitoring. Run program "_compiled/bin-utils/ul_evpchk".
If you pres "p" once or multiple times and then Enter, you
should see, that FD 0 receives your characters
<5>@ fd #0 evptrig 1 count 1
'p'
Then there should be 10x burs series of 50 pipe writes and reads.
Each series is separated by short timed delay.
The print of last few reads and writes looks like this
<5>@ pipe #3 rd evptrig 1 count wr 499 rd 498
<5>@ pipe #4 wr evptrig 2 count wr 500 rd 499
<5>***** ul_evpoll_dispatch returned 1 *****
<5>***** ul_evpoll_dispatch called *****
<5>@ pipe #3 rd evptrig 1 count wr 500 rd 499
<5>@ pipe #3 rd final count reached
<4>@ pipe rd #3 wr #4 destroyed
<3>@ pipe active count reached 0 in 20131
The important is the last line, which confirms, that all FIFOs
has reached final count and that there is 0 active pipes now.
The last number informs about time in ms spent before
all pipes has finished. There are some distracting prints
about timers 1,2,3 to test timers support in parallel.
If you like to get rid of these, you can comment out 
or disable timer lines in
ulevloop/ul_evpchk.c
-  if(1) {
+  if(0) {
     add_my_timer(2000, 0);
     add_my_timer(3000, 20);
     add_my_timer(1400, 10);
   }
You can check the code with epoll event monitoring mechanism
then
_compiled/bin-utils/ul_evpchk lnxepoll
It works same way (correctly) without patch.
You can try to glib support as well - surprisingly by parameter "glib".
You can start with "lnxepoll" again and then pres "C"+Enter
to cascade epoll in glib main loop. Again worked correctly in past.
If you cascade by "E"+Enter, then cascading of epoll into epoll
is requested and it failed in default setup. If the output
has been redirected, then it worked correctly in some situations.
The other tests can be invoked by another letters
  "t" .. run 1000 active FDs in parallel
  "T" .. run 10000 active FDs in parallel
  "l"  .. create 1000 inactive FDs as load to epoll
   "L" .. created 8000 inactive FDs
The all these has been working with all mechanisms before patching,
even with cascading except epoll at epoll cascade.
These huge tests switch low debug level so only errors
and final reports are seen after test letter.
The glib based tests for 10000 FDs is horribly long, so I have
not found patience to run it at full.
There are some tests results for different tests and mechanisms.
Each test is invoked by initial command line. The first number is number
of active FDs (500 events scheduled for each), the second number
of inactive FDs, the third is mechanism (cascade means epoll cascaded
on glib), the last number is time in ms. 
All test has been run on Core 2 Duo T7300  @ 2.00GHz

1000 0 sysvpoll 1369
1000 0 epoll    1570

Thanks again for testing and if you have some time and interrest,
you can try my kernel torture on your boxes,
