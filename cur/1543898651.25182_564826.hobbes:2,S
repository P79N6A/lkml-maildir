Hi all,
Thanks to HP, ISC and Umeå Universitet, kernel.org now has official
servers in Europe.  Specifically, we have www1.eu.kernel.org hosted at
ISC Amsterdam, and www2.eu.kernel.org at UMU (Umeå, Sweden.)  They are
collectively accessible as www.eu.kernel.org.
This is a full service of kernel.org and not a mirror.  In the future,
we hope to add some sort of smart DNS to automatically redirect traffic,
as well as additional services in Europe.
