I think you misunderstood.  The right interface to call, that should
work everywhere, should be the simple, obvious one.  ioremap().  That
effectively is what everyone gets anyway (since they test on x86).
So change the *definition* of ioremap() to be uncached.  Then we can add
ioremap_wc() and ioremap_cached() for these special purpose mappings.

I know there's similar issues with Itanium.  IIRC, the EFI memory map
helps here by saying how various different types of memory should be
mapped.
