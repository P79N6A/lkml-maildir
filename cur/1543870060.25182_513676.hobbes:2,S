OK. Recopiled the kernel with CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO=y
This gives: 
(gdb) l *evdev_disconnect+0xb1
No symbol "evdev_disconnect" in current context.
I guess you meant gdb drivers/input/evdev.ko
This gives:
(gdb) l *evdev_disconnect+0xb1
0xa81 is in evdev_disconnect (include/asm/processor.h:716).
711        However we don't do prefetches for pre XP Athlons currently
712        That should be fixed. */
713     #define ARCH_HAS_PREFETCH
714     static inline void prefetch(const void *x)
715     {
716             alternative_input(ASM_NOP4,
717                               "prefetchnta (%1)",
718                               X86_FEATURE_XMM,
719                               "r" (x));
