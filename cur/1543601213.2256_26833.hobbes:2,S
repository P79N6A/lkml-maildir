That is the right way a block based FS non journaled should act in a Unix
system. Basically fsck can see inode numbers, not file names.
That is also the way UFS acts, and belive me, older UFS versions were
mutch more prone to corruptions and crashes (Solaris 8 UFS seems t make
journaling of part of meta-data, but I am not sure). In front of UFS ext2
is more than rock solid. Unattached i-nodes are just something that can
happen for this kind of filesystems.
If you want a different behaviour, like for sure many others suggested, go
to a journaled filesystem. It seems to me that you would need a filesystem
that would make journaling of both meta-data and data like ext3 or jfs,
(actually reiserFS journals just metadata)
