What applications other than the very specialised case of filesystem
servers do you expect will ever want to use it?
The difference between inotify and leases is, as I said, that leases
notify the lease holder synchronously. This allows the notified process
to flush all the cached information _before_ the operation that
triggered the lease notification is executed.
