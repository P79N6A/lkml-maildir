 C integer type will fail.  Something like the following should
 suffice:

+	Historically, counter has been declared as a volatile int.  This
+is now discouraged in favor of explicitly casting it as volatile where
+volatile behavior is required.  Most architectures will only require such
+a cast in atomic_read() and atomic_set(), as well as their 64-bit versions
+if applicable, since the more complex atomic operations directly or
+indirectly use assembly that results in volatile behavior.
 
 	The first operations to implement for atomic_t's are the
 initializers and plain reads.

-	#define atomic_set(v, i)	((v)->counter = (i))
+	#define atomic_set(v, i)	(*(volatile int *)&(v)->counter = (i))
 
 The first macro is used in definitions, such as:

 Next, we have:

+	#define atomic_read(v)	(*(volatile int *)&(v)->counter)
 
 which simply reads the current value of the counter.
