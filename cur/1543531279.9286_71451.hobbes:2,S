This "ideal" solution will have to cope with *all* processes requesting
at the same time their signal handlers + garbages collectors (which
are not part of their working-sets) being paged-in to be executed.
This will increase pressure on the mm subsystem a lot. A lot of RAM should be
freed to allow this sudden change in the working set of all processes.
Garbage collectors on "big" processes are likely to touch most of their
data pages in search of "victims" to be garbaged.
Much like when you're short of CPU cycles to ask every process to
*recompute* its CPU needs.
