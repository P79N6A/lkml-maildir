Accurate timing is one thing.  Short mix->output latency is another.
Accurate timing is easy if you buffer enough data.  To 1/44000th of a
second, no problem.
I don't believe 0.01s output latency is necessary.  The video isn't even
that fast.  We humans are used to seeing things before hearing them, so
a short 0.05s delay is fine.  Seemed fine for the last game I worked on
anyway...
