I'm fine with it; I'd rather someone else (who has more interest
in the machines) picked it up.
The basic idea is to rip out the arm26 code from arch/arm and
include/asm-arm, thereby allowing include/asm-arm/proc-armv to
be collapsed into include/asm-arm, removing some clutter.
Separating it out should also allow arm26 to shrink down to
something smaller, which is fairly critical for these machines.
