I just checked tip/master, and I do still get the messages:
[   66.895807] X:5022 map pfn expected mapping type write-back for d0000000-d0101000, got write-combining
[   66.895873] X:5022 freeing invalid memtype d0000000-d0101000
As for 3D performance issues, glxgears without any other applications running gives:
    457 frames in 5.0 seconds = 91.312 FPS
    475 frames in 5.0 seconds = 94.887 FPS
    478 frames in 5.0 seconds = 95.411 FPS
I can't say for sure, but I expect those numbers should be much higher for a 3D accelerated radeon card (even if it is a little old):
    01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc M9+ 5C61 [Radeon Mobility 9200 (AGP)] (rev 01)
glxinfo gives:
    direct rendering: Yes
Anything else I can try?
