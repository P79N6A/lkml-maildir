I am having difficulties with memory allocation in  teh 2.4.17 kernel.
Memory is being agressively given as cache but not retrieved to be used
as 'normal' ran.  Consequently, I will have a machine that has 5M
'normal' RAM, 800M 'cache' RAM and the reset coming out of swap space.
I need this 'cache' RAM placed back into the available RAM pool to be
used by applications.  Is there a patch/kernel configuration that I can
change this behavior?
