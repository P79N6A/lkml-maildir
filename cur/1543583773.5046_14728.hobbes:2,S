For devices, the support is already there.  See Documentation/pci.txt. 
Look for 'probe', 'id_table', etc.
I don't think there is support in the current tree for a controller that
supports physical hotplugging of PCI adapters, yet.  Compaq has a driver
outside the tree to do such a thing (needing only very minor kernel
patches), see
