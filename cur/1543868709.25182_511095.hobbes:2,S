Subject: [PATCH 0/2] use symbolic constants in generic lseek code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The generic lseek code in fs/read_write.c uses hardcoded values for
SEEK_{SET,CUR,END}.
Patch 1 fixes the case statements to use the symbolic constants in
include/linux/fs.h, and should not be at all controversial.
Patch 2 adds a SEEK_MAX and uses it to validate user arguments.  This makes
the code a little cleaner and also enables future extensions (such as
SEEK_DATA and SEEK_HOLE).  If anyone has a problem with this, please speak up.
