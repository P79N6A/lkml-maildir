That's because userspace still has that port open.

Yup, glad it's all working properly for you.

Nice.

Nope.  Why would you want to do such a thing?

It's been discussed that the tty_hangup() should be done for the port
when this happens.  I haven't messed with it to test it out, as no one
has complained in the 5+ years of usb-serial drivers being in the kernel
:)
Also, you could use something like udev to make the name always show up
the same for the device node no matter if it was called ttyUSB0 or
ttyUSB1, which might solve some of your problems (but not others it
sounds like.)
thanks,
