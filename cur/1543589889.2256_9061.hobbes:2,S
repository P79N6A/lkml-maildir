I would disagree
There are five cases I am seeing
1.	Serverworks total APIC hose ups.
	Fix: remove OSB4 or use -ac tree
2.	440BX and similar boards losing interrupts on some drivers
	Fix: use -ac
3.	APIC errors notably checksum errors. 
	Fix: buy properly manufactured hardware
4.	Hangs on boot with the CUV4XD and a couple of other boards.
	Still a mystery
5.	Incorrect PCI IRQ routing
	Fix: Mostly get a board with a correct BIOS. There are a couple of 
	cases people are looking at - some are fixed in 2.4.4 and -ac
	where magic IRQ lines are not visible directly in PCI space
