which makes it a (name)space, no?

as it is currently done for vfs, uts, ipc and soon
pid and network l2/l3, yes?

an alternative for that is to keep the resource
stuff as part of a 'context' structure, and keep
a reference from the task to that (one less
indirection, as we had for vfs before)

sounds very 'cache intensive' to me ...
(especially compared to the one indirection be use atm)

which is very probably not what you want, as it
 - will definitely hurt interactivity
 - give strange 'jerky' behaviour
 - ignore established priorities

please provide real world numbers from testing ...
at least for me, that is not really obvious in
four way indirection  :)
