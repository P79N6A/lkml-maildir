Don't underastand this. If you mean the atomicity, CRC may help here. 
And no problems. Or may be you missed the the fact that we have 
eraseblock size = writeblock size?

It erases individual page, then writes there. To put it differently, in

P.S. I actually missed the mailing list, this should have gone to the
