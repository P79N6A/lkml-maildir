Would it not be a lot better to just mask off PREEMPT_ACTIVE() instead of 
checking for it explicitly.
The in_interrupt() etc stuff already effectively do this by masking off
the HARDIRQ_MASK etc. I would prefer a patch to hardirq.h that just adds a
#define to make preempt_count() not contain PREEMPT_ACTIVE - and make the
PREEMPT_ACTIVE checks be a totally separate check (logic: it's not a
count, so it shouldn't show up in preempt_count())

I certainly wouldn't mind the DEBUG/WARNING/FATAL infrastructure discussed 
earlier..
