Then fsck should exit RC=1.   At least the Fedora Core 2 initscripts think
that's OK and specifically check for that case (a few lines later it remounts /
r/w, which *should* refresh all the important in-core blocks that might have
gotten changed out from under it - I think. If that's not true, somebody squawk
so we can fix that assumption in the initscrips. ;)

NO.
Consider - if you *do* scrog your filesystem, you'll get hung in a loop
of fsck/reboot/fsck/reboot/fsck/reboot.  You really *do* want the system
to yell for help from a human at that point....
