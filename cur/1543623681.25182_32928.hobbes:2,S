Versus fully allocating the backing store, which would neither hang nor 
cause segfaults.  This is the behaviour that one expects by default, and 
should be the first line of defense before going to the overcommit model.  
Get that aspect of reliability in place, then add the overcommit support.  
What is better: having uml fail before attempting to boot with an unable 
to allocate backing store message, or a random oops during early kernel 
init?  As I see it, supporting the safe mode of operation first makes more 
sense before adding yet another arch hook.
