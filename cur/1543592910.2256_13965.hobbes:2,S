I've been working with these boards for a couple months and thought they
were great.  However, now it turns out that they won't fit into our
systems too well (a little too long).  Does anyone have knowledge of
another brand that has a (slightly) smaller form factor?  I did some
checking on Pricewatch but wasn't able to find anything that fit our
needs.
TIA,
