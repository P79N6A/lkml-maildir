Hi Adam,
The question is really in Keith Owen's domain so you need to check
with him.  I am just saying that I went down that road once and I
didn't stumble over any gotchas.
Also Linus is freezing 2.4 and I don't see any kbuild work on the
2.4 TODO list so he might say "hold it until 2.5".
Michael
