It is isn't it? :-) I'll think of something else to protect my code :-)
I'd say fundamentally fucked.
I only thought of it as a way to protect my code from being
misused by companys protecting thier hardware registers and specs.
Hmmm... Im going to have another chat with my solicitors :-)
I won't however put £67,000 in rn'd down the pan by people 
exploiting me :-)
Perhaps i'll do a direct X type thing and make the v.92 
library/codec/stack proprietary with LGPL -> GPL --> kernel
linking, free of course :)
My solicitors say at least three companies would abuse
the GPL code ive done.
I have to get the code ready for a site, possibly SF but
probably not.
