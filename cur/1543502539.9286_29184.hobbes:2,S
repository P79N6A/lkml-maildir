Help!
I am trying to use Linux as an NFS server for a VMS box that runs our
configuration management software.  For a while it appeared to work, but
after a couple of compilations on the VMS system all nfsd's on Linux lock
up.   I've noticed that the logfile contains a lot of errors of the form -
Jul 13 10:24:39 axlnfs01 kernel: EXT2-fs warning (device sd(8,17)):
ext2_free_in
ode: bit already cleared for inode 81924
Jul 13 10:24:39 axlnfs01 kernel: lookup_by_inode: ino 81924 not found in
john
Jul 13 10:24:39 axlnfs01 kernel: find_fh_dentry: 08:11/81924 dir/81921 not
found
!
Jul 13 10:24:39 axlnfs01 kernel: EXT2-fs warning (device sd(8,17)):

ocks: bit already cleared for block 327995

Performing any operation on an existing file, including deleting it produces
a list of errors.  Creating new files doesn't appear to cause problems.
When nfsd hangs, the VMS compiler is inserting a new object into a library.
I am running Redhat 6.0, kernel 2.2.5-15.  I originally had knfsd 1.2.2-4
and I have upgraded to knfsd 1.4-2 but it hasn't helped.  On the VMS box I
am running TCPWARE.
Thanks
Alex
