Just an FYI: I believe the x440 breaks this assumption. 
There are 2 chunks on the first CEC. The current discontig patch for it
has to drop the second chunk (anything over 3.5G on the first CEC) in
order to work w/ the existing code. However, that will probably need to
be addressed at some point, so be aware that this might affect you as
well. 
thanks
