There's a mixture of GC algorithms in HotSpot including generational and I
believe a traditional mark/sweep. GC isn't my expertise per se.
Think, you have a compiled code block and you suspend/interrupt threads when
you either start hitting the stack yellow guard or by a periodic GC thread...
That can happen anytime, so you can't just expect things to drop onto a
regular boundary in the compiled code block. It's for that reason that
you have to some kind of OS level threading support to get the ucontext.
