Maybe. I believe it's possible to configure the Sierra kit to present an
NDIS interface. Not at all sure how that works. I'd have thought it
would be another layer on top of ppp, but who knows?
But I'm not sure I know how to do that anyway, without hardware to test
with.
For example, look at the info Roland sent me for his Kyocera:
I:  If#= 0 Alt= 0 #EPs= 3 Cls=ff(vend.) Sub=ff Prot=ff Driver=airprime
E:  Ad=81(I) Atr=03(Int.) MxPS=  16 Ivl=128ms
E:  Ad=82(I) Atr=02(Bulk) MxPS=  64 Ivl=0ms
E:  Ad=02(O) Atr=02(Bulk) MxPS=  64 Ivl=0ms
I:  If#= 1 Alt= 0 #EPs= 2 Cls=ff(vend.) Sub=ff Prot=ff Driver=airprime
E:  Ad=84(I) Atr=02(Bulk) MxPS=  64 Ivl=0ms
E:  Ad=04(O) Atr=02(Bulk) MxPS=  64 Ivl=0ms
Which is somewhat different from the MC5720 results you and I get.
Notice it appears to show 2 interfaces, with 1 pair of in/out bulk EPs
on each. We see 1 interface with 3 pairs. I don't know if/how that
difference needs to be addressed in the driver.
I wonder if that's why Ken got 6 EPs. Perhaps his 580 card presents 2
interfaces, with 3 EPs each.
Also, I know how to drive the 2nd EP on the MC5720. So I can test that
it actually works. But I have to rely on information I can't disclose to
do that (pesky NDAs). I don't know anything about the 3rd EP. And if
there really are 6 EPs on the 580, how the heck do we test that...
Seems the deeper I dig here, the murkier this all gets. I'm inclined to
keep it simple for now, at least... Really, how many users need those
extra EPs?
