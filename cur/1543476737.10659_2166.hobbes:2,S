Subject: 2.2.0-pre.. ignores SCSI CD-ROM on AIC7890

As the subject says - since 2.2.0-pre (tried 5 and 6) the kernel won't
recognize my UltraPlex SCSI CD-ROM on Adaptec AIC-7890 controller
(didn't test it on others).
The machine is a SMP dual PII (Asus P2B-DS with on-board SCSI).
Everything was OK until 2.1.132 (including), so I was a bit surprised
that 2.2.0 somehow "lost" the CD-ROM.
Any ideas ? What additional info should I provide ? [while booting the
kernel driver identifies all other devices - narrow and wide - only the
Plex is missing, but native SCSI BIOS (and even Linux 1.2.132) finds
it.]
Also just a little thing:
Framebuffer support with my ATI Xpert@Work may be (?) a little bit
buggy: the poor Penguin is just rubbish in the upper right corner -
looks like two pictures side-by-side with incorrect colors, but text is
OK (hey, even back-scrolling works ! good work!). But I didn't bother
with the settings much, so consider it just as a question.
