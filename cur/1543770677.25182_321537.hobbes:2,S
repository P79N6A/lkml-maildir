It means that the logical device is disabled and it most cases it means that this chip is not used for hw. monitoring.
Please can you tell us your motherboard brand and model?
Also please run sensors-detect script include whole output in your next email.
Tell us what version of kernel and lm_sensors you use.
We can try to forcibly enable in future.
Thanks
Regards
Rudolf
