I think it's quite complex to make a reliable inference of maintainership 
information from git. Given a set of historical modifiers of a file, 
would you take the most common commiter(s), or the most common 
_recent_ commiter(s), or what? It's a bit fuzzy.
Moreover, it is slow in comparison and assumes the availability of 
local .git db, which wouldn't be the case for some porition of patch 
submitters.

Hopefully it gets ignored if it is quite low in priority. In that
case the CC is a NOP but might still be good for archiving purposes.

BTS was discussed to death already, let's not delve into that...
