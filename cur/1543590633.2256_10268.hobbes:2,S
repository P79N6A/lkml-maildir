That's not true, at least not in my case. Data is temporarily
inaccessible, and in extreme cases, the Kernel might panic, but I never
suffered from permanent damage. There might be other reasons, old
kernel, old patch, old user-space utilities, hardware flaws. I'm not a
good friend of ReiserFS on Linux 2.2 in production, but let's please
keep honest, regardless of how big the anger may have grown.

True, catches EACCES.

Also true, because they're not broken.

It's probably not. vs-13048 can usually be rectified (ugly, slow but
usually works on machines even with 256 MB RAM and 1/2 GB swap) by ls
-laR / or treescan -stat /.

Well, it would be really a good idea to consider if the patch might be
merged into ReiserFS 3.5.33, but AFAICS, the ReiserFS team have focused
on getting 3.6 solid. Hans, does ReiserFS 3.6 suffer from vs-13048 or
similar problems with NFS in plain Linux 2.4.4 or does ist still need
patches as 3.5.x does?
