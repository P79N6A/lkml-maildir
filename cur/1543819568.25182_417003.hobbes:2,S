Subject: [patch 0/6] Notify page fault call chain

Hi Andrew,
Currently in the do_page_fault() code path, we call notify_die(DIE_PAGE_FAULT, ...)
to notify the page fault. The only interested components for this page fault
notifications are Kprobes and/or kdb. Since notify_die() is highly overloaded,
this page fault notification is currently being sent to other components
registered with register_die_notification() which uses the same die_chain to loop
for all the registered components.
In order to optimize the do_page_fault() code path, this critical page fault notification
is now moved to different call chain and the test results showed great improvements.
Patches for i386, x86_64, ia64, powerpc and sparc64 follows this mail.
Please apply.
Thanks,
Anil Keshavamurthy
