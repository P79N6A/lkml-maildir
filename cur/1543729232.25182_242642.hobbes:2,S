In order to be at the top of a result list with a search engine, you need to qualify with them.
Our company does the qualifing for Google, Yahoo!, MSN, and several other companies.
If you'd like to see if your website qualifies for a better position, reply with your contact info
and web address. Usual response will come in a couple days after review.
