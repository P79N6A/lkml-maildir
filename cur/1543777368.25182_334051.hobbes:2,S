Interesting. I have observed the following (2.6.13-rc1 and a little 
earlier):
    mplayer bla.avi -vo cvidix
After the blanking time, all chars turn black[1] but are still "visible" 
thanks the movie in the background - a vga palette manipulation to the entries 
0-15 as it seems. This is quite different to writing 80x25 the space character.
