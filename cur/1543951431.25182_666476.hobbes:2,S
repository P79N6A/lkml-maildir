I expect you got those numbers with 2.6.25-rc4?  Towards the end of -rc5
there's a patch from Nick to make SLUB's treatment of HWCACHE_ALIGN the
same as SLAB's, so I expect you'd be back to a similar poor density with
SLUB too.  (But I'm replying without actually testing it out myself.)
I think you'd need a strong reason to choose HWCACHE_ALIGN for these.
Consider: the (normal configuration) x86_64 struct page size was 56
bytes for a long time (and still is without MEM_RES_CTLR), but we've
never inserted padding to make that a round 64 bytes (and they would
benefit additionally from some simpler arithmetic, not the case with
page_cgroups).  Though it's good to avoid unnecessary sharing and
multiple cacheline accesses, it's not so good as to justify almost
doubling the size of a very very common structure.  I think.
