If yes, why? it's not exactly a big function:
static inline dma_addr_t
dma_map_single(struct device *hwdev, void *ptr, size_t size,
	       int direction)
{
	BUG_ON(!valid_dma_direction(direction));
	return dma_ops->map_single(hwdev, ptr, size, direction);
}
I'd rather we not make it out-of-line without a compelling (numerical)
reason.
Cheers,
Muli
