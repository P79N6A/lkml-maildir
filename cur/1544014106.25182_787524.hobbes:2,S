Thats pretty accurate IIUC.  The concept and original patches were
written by myself, Peter Morreale and Sven Dietrich (cc'd).  However,
Steve cleaned up our patch before accepting it into -rt (we had extra
provisions for things like handling conditional compilation and run-time
disablement which he did not care for), but its otherwise the precise
core concept we introduced.  I think Steven gave a nice attribution to
that fact in the prologue, however.  And I also ACKed his cleanup, so I
think all is well from my perspective.
As a historical note: It should be mentioned that Steven also introduced
a really brilliant optimization to use RCU for the owner tracking that
the original patch as submitted by my team did not have.  However, it
turned out to inadvertently regress performance due to the way
preempt-rcu's rcu_read_lock() works so it had to be reverted a few weeks
later to the original logic that we submitted (even though on paper his
ideas in that area were superior to ours).  So whats in -rt now really
is more or less our patch sans the conditional crap, etc. 
Hope that helps!
