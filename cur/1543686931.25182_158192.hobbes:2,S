My question for today: does anyone know what kswapd actually does?
This morning, my workstation (linux ia64 2.6.0-test3) was fairly lightly 
loaded:
08:28:50 up 2 days,  1:49,  4 users,  load average: 1.77, 1.79, 1.20
Mem:   2062032k total,  1916368k used,   145664k free,   119952k buffers
Swap:  2016112k total,     1984k used,  2014128k free,   697920k cached
As you can see, there was gobs of RAM I wasn't using.
Anyway, as I was enjoying my tasty breakfast cereal, I noticed kswapd 
decided to wake up and say hello:

	It seems I can make kswapd use fairly nontrivial amounts of CPU time by 
running a perfectly innocent userland program. lsh is a raytracer I'm 
starting to work on. It's a standard C program, which uses MPI (I'm 
using LAM 7.0). The parallelism is trivial - each process renders a 
section of the image (divided vertically), line-at-a-time. The imbalance 
in CPU time between the processes is due to some sections of the scene 
being less interesting than others and finishing more quickly.
	Does anyone have _any_ idea what kswapd might actually be doing? I 
checked: not a single page was swapped in our out througout the duration 
of this test. Is there a chance that spinning on some lock (I have no 
idea how LAM does its synchronization), or perhaps even just idling, 
might be counted as kswapd0?
	Curious,
	Duraid

my program, the black is idle time.
