Quite possibly. Are you still using the eepro100 NAPI driver? I doubt
that it's gotten wide testing.
The patch at 
http://gtf.org/lunz/linux/net/
 comes from here:
ftp://robur.slu.se/pub/Linux/net-development/NAPI/eepro100/eepro100-napi-020619.tar.gz
The NAPI conversion was done by fxzhang@ict.ac.cn (see the README); you
may want to ask him about problems you're having.
