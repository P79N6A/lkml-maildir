Hello,
I'm doing some research on suspending/resuming a single task in Linux 2.6.x.
At this point I've succeded dumping the whole task state (CPU context, regs,
memory, fds, etc.) to an external file and reading it back to a pre-defined
structure (I know that reading/writing files directly to/from kernel is a bad
thing - I'm working *only* on a p.o.c. and currently there's no other
purpose), but I'm stuck in getting restored task to get running again.
Are there any ways to re-register restored task as a running one in some
"easy" way or should I perform some manual modyfications to the kerenel
structures?
Can anyone suggest me some solution to this problem?
Regards,
Wojciech
