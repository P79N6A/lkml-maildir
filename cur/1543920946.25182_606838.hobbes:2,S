Subject: [2.6 patch] USB iowarrior.c: fix check-after-use
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/18/138

The Coverity checker spotted that we have already oops'ed if "dev"
was NULL.
Since "dev" being NULL doesn't seem to be possible here this patch 
removes the NULL check.
