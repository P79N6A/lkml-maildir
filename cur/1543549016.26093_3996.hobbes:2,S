I tried to compile the sr_mod without the __init & __exit but this did (as
expected) to cure the problem.
The problem seems to reside in the ide-scsi driver; if the cdrom (sr_mod) is
not loaded, I get during initialisation of the ide-scsi module a lockup
after printing the information about the 1st host (dies after the 'Type:
CDROM' line). Probing the 2nd host seems to fail.
Frank.
