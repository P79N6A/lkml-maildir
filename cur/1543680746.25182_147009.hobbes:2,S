Ok,
Here's a valid use for subnet router anycase that isn't working.
Somebody asked me how to set up 6to4, so I did a little testing.
Doesn't work:
hades:~# ip route add ::/0 via 2002:c058:6301::
RTNETLINK answers: Invalid argument
Works:
hades:~# ip route add ::/0 via 2002:c058:6301::1
Unfortunately the first form is what I need:
hades:~# host -t AAAA 6to4.ipv6.funet.fi
6to4.ipv6.funet.fi has AAAA address 2001:708:0:1::624
6to4.ipv6.funet.fi has AAAA address 2002:c058:6301::
So apparently there really is an inappropriate subnet router anycast
sanity check. Please fix this!
