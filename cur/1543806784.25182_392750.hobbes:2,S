I had a look in the spec[1] and things didn't exactly get any clearer. 
All it says is that the encoding 01 (binary) means "Multiple Block", no 
a single word on its semantics or an example of when it should be used. 
So I still advocate the simpler approach (code complexity-wise) until we 
have a test case that says it's insufficient.
