Can you test whether it's the "and 0xfe" or the "or $2" that does it for
you?
Right now we know that the Olivetti M4 has problems with the "or $2". I'd
like to know if this is the same bit #1, or whether it's #0.
[ And I agree with Peter - if somebody knows BIOS programming and how to
  use "int 15" to enter protected mode, then that migth well be the
  easiest solution. The only real reason the linux setup code does it by
  hand is that the original code was written that way - and it was written
  that way because I had never used the BIOS in my life before, _and_ I
  wanted to learn the i386. Both of which were valid reasons back in 1991.
  Neither of which is probably a very good reason ten years later ;]
