The fix for 3ware oops in 2.2.17pre14 is this:
Change the function call:
tw_setfeature(tw_dev, 2, 1, &c);
to be:
tw_setfeature(tw_dev2, 2, 1, &c);

I compiled 2.2.17pre14 with MTRR support turned off.  The kernel
oopsed in the same spot.
I then copied the 2.2.17pre9 drivers/scsi/3w-xxxx.* stuff into
the 2.2.17pre14 directory and recompiled.
I.E. I've compiled 2.2.17pre14 with the 3ware driver from 2.2.17pre9.
2.2.17pre14 (with 2.2.17pre9 3ware driver) boots fine.

I take it I can't try RAID10 till I get the 3ware driver up to the
2.2.17pre14 version?
