i went down this road before a few months back, checking on how many
source files were unnecessarily including moduleparam.h, and the
result was literally *hundreds*.  i took a shot at cleaning that up,
and even factoring the non-parameter-related content out of that file,
but the change would have been hugely disruptive.
as it is now, since module.h includes moduleparam.h, there is (as you
can see) no reason whatever for *anyone* to include moduleparam.h.
at least right now.
but if anyone ever aspires to tidy up this chaos, then all you'd end
up doing is putting all those includes back in.  so unless there's a
long-term goal here, it would seem safest to just leave things the way
they are.  but that's someone else's decision, not mine.  i'm just
reporting on how quickly things got unpleasant when *i* tried to do
something with this once upon a time.
