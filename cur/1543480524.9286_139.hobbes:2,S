This is my first posting to this list.  I hope this is not an FAQ or a 
topic that has already been addressed;  I tried searching the archives 
and didn't find any mention of this topic.
I am running 2.2.0-pre7, compiled with gcc-2.7.2.3 and using libc
5.4.46 on a single-processor Pentium system.  It has been running
smoothly for almost a week now; performance seems quite good.
I've noticed something unusual when debugging using GDB - of user
processes, not the kernel - in particular I've been running the Python 
interpreter inside a debugger with a few breakpoints, and although it
seems to be working fine, /var/log/syslog is getting filled up with 
tons of kernel messages - stuff that looks like this:
Jan 14 15:39:30 sirius kernel: Process: python (stack=c08ffef0, task=c08fe000)
Jan 14 15:39:30 sirius kernel: [<c01077bb>] [<c01183d7>] [<c010d935>] [<c010db95>] [<c0108642>] [<c0107bad>] [<c0107ac4>]

Any ideas what might be causing this?
I'm using gdb version 4.17.
