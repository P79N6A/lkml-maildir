I have problems with iptables and openmosix system. The kernel is halted 
  when I write DENY by default in INPUT keys. This machine boot from net 
and have root in other coputer..
What is the solution ? ( and problem:( )
My kernel 2.4.20 - with openmosix patch
(same problem if don't work with openmosix patch)
Can this kernel work with DENY politic boot first from net ?
thanks

I build an automatic system. This read mails from any folder of my 
client, update a list with bad ip's (spamers) and update firewall with 
new ips. Now the attack to my system is very small. I have more of 1000 
senders checked ;)
Thanks to all !
