You guessed right.  Your non-technical note was applicable.
Andrew - why doesn't your "The perfect patch" mention this?
    
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/tpp.txt
Linus - would you like a patch to Documentation/SubmittingPatches
    that mentions this?
Hmmm ... I don't even see the "Acked-by" in these patch guides either.
Probably I should include that in SubmittingPatches as well.
Too bad that first line doesn't start "Author:" instead of "From:".
Oh well - I see Andrew already suggested that, and you declined.
(You should'a listened to him ;).
