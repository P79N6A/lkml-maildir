Again... sorry, I don't try to be picky, just want to know if its worth or
not...
Would not be better something like:
	if (idle == NOT_IDLE || rq->nr_running > 1) {
		if (rq->nr_running)
			source_load = (source_load*rq->prio_bias) / rq->nr_running;
	}
  
wrt the integer math ? Think of
100*( 5/5) vs  500/5
100*( 6/5) vs  600/5
100*( 7/5) vs  700/5
100*( 8/5) vs  800/5
100*( 9/5) vs  900/5
100*(10/5) vs 1000/5
