Hi,
sorry for my late answer.
The hardware which Oopses due to the third (PATA) channel is:
02:0b.0 Mass storage controller: Promise Technology, Inc.
PDC20575 (SATAII150 TX2plus) (rev 02)
I know it's the PATA chan which fails because i commented the
part discovering the third channel out, giving me a working
system :)
Thanks for that suggestion / idea :)
kind regards
prx
