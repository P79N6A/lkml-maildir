==> Regarding Process "pickling"; "Curtis M. Brune" <curtis_brune@workspot.com> adds:

curtis_brune> Has this been a discussed before?  Is it even possible?
curtis_brune> Seems very useful.
     If you mean checkpoint/restart and/or process migration, then yes.
     There are patches you can obtain to do this.  See bproc:
           
http://beowulf.gsfc.nasa.gov/software/bproc.html
     There is a less portable set of patches named epckpt found here:
           
http://www.cs.rochester.edu/~edpin/epckpt/
     Currently I am working on a project to perform transparent process
     migration.  It was originally based on epckpt, but then we moved to
     bproc.  There is no useful code as of now.  If you would like to track
     our progress, see:
