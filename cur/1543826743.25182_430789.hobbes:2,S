Ok, this shouldn't be that issue as the sparsemem checks won't tickle
that puppy, not enough swap devices in use.  That said, I've just run a
full sweep of sparsemem and its GOOD across the board on swap patch and
2222 deadlock.  Sadly this failure is on a machine which has just bitten
the dust and I'm waiting for it to be mended.  Not sure how long that
will take.
