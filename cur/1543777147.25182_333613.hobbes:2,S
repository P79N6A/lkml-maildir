Just brought the SIS based Xeon box up on -51-28 with CONFIG_IOAPIC_FAST
and without the noapic option, and all is well.  On -50-43, noapic was 
needed to avoid the spurious interrupt and APIC error on CPU0 messages.
Are there any non-SIS chipsets out there that need the sis_apic_bug 
checks?  What about IOAPIC_POSTFLUSH?
