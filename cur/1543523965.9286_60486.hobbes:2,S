Subject: [PATCH] 2.3.41 - small Configure.help fixup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

While scanning for the few places where a kernel config option doesn't
start with CONFIG_ I found that CONFIG_PPP_SYNC_TTY didn't have a leading
descriptor line like the 1054 other options.  Although I can't find a
place that really enforces a syntax for Documentation/Configure.help,
this seems pretty obvious and acceptable.  FWIW, the options were:
Good-Bad DMA Model-Firmware (EXPERIMENTAL),IDEDMA_NEW_DRIVE_LISTINGS
HPT366 Fast Interrupt support (EXPERIMENTAL) (WIP),HPT366_FAST_IRQ_PREDICTION
HPT366 mode three unsupported (EXPERIMENTAL) (WIP),HPT366_MODE3
Special UDMA Feature,PDC202XX_FORCE_BURST_BIT
Special Mode Feature (EXPERIMENTAL),PDC202XX_FORCE_MASTER_MODE
