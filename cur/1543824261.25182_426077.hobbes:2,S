Yes, the bzip2 author I have been told was originally planning to do that, but then 
thought it would be harder to deploy that way (because gzip is a core utility, and people 
are nervous about making it larger.)
You'd have to ask him for the details, though.
It *is* true that there is a fair bit of code out there which sees a gzip magic number and 
expects to call deflate functions on it, without ever checking the compression type field. 
  However, even if there is a need for a new magic number, this can be done within the 
gzip code, or by forking gzip.
