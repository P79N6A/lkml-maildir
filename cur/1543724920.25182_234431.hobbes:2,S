The instructions are always executed from RAM even if the executable
file is on a physical disk. The file is memory-mapped. Execute
`man mmap`. One of the parameters is MAP_FILE. The whole file
is mapped, however, only that which is necessary at a particular
time is actually read from the disk, one page at a time.
