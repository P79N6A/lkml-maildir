I can't seem to get the kernel to detect the IDE CDROM and Hard-disk  
at all on the latest (5,8) PowerBook revision - no IDE controller is  
reported in the dmesg. I have tried 2.6.8 from debian as well as  
2.6.12x from Ubuntu and Gentoo.
Both  the HDD and CDROM drives look fairly routine stuff to me  
although I am not sure what kind of IDE controller is inside..
Is there any point in trying newer kernels?
