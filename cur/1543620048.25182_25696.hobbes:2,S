Subject: gprof / profiling support ?

I'm trying to profile an application
using the 'gprof' utility, and in particular
get timing information from the profile.
For some reason, the output from gprof
displays 
"no time accumulated"
and I see no cumulative/self seconds
at all.  However, all of the call counts
appear to be correct.
I suspect that the sampling rate using
by gprof/linux is simply two slow, given
the particular application I'm running.
Can anybody help me obtain timing information
from gprof and/or point me to a better
source for application profiling in general?
Thankyou for your support.
