This is a problem some people seem to have with 2.2.12, but I'm still
having it in 2.2.14:
2.2.12:
After 20 days uptime a network interface just stops, routing, ifconfig
etc. seems fine, just no network traffic coming in or going out.
No messages in logs.
Seems to happen on a 2.2.12 machine with multiple NIC's and multiple
IP's on NIC's.
The one describing the problem on one of the mailing lists rebooted the
machines every week -I've not been able to reach him-.
2.2.14:
Got a machine with multiple NIC's, (3), multiple IP's on them, ipchains,
one of the interfaces is configured with ipx+ip.
After 20 days and 7 hours, the interface with ipx+ip stops, ifconfig,
routing etc. still seem to be completely happy.
doing an "ifdown eth0; ifup eth0" makes things work again.
Summary:
A problem of 2.2.12 seems to be fixed in 2.2.14, exept for an interface
using ipx+ip (ehh, just a guess).
Anyone having similar problems/had similar problems, the "20 days 7
hours" seems to have something to do with it.
Be well,
Jeroen.
