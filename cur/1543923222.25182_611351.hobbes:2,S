I only read the mail from Adrian, because I was 100% sure that my
device is such a Maxtor Onetouch, because it's a external HDD and has
buttons. (I even compiled this driver into my kernel when it was
added...)
But after finding these two git commits and starting to write my
initial mail I looked for the exact name of my device and found that
this is not a Maxtor at all but a Western Digital.
So I'm rather unsure if this driver will work for me...
Anyway here is my /proc/bus/input/devices:

The button part of the device is visible in sysfs under bus/usb, but
not under class/input:
(There is also a cardreader, a hub and the hdd visible under
/sys/bus/usb/devices/1-5 )
