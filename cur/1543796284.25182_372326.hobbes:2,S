Sure, but there is no extra indirection with the fastpath routines like
read_pda, write_pda and friends with the current patch.  
Places where cpu_pda[] is accessed by the array name are not really
important -- except for the static per_cpu_offset of another cpu.  But
still it might be worth it (considering that people use 
per_cpu(var, smp_processor_id()), instead of __get_cpu_var in many places).  
I will incorporate this.
