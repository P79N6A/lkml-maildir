Flash cards are -slow-. Also jffs2 is mostly synchronous so it writes
the long bit by bit. The flash wear is on erase not write. You could
certainly teach jffs2 a bit more about batching writes. The other issue
with jffs2 is startup because it is a log you have to read the entire
log to know what state you are in
