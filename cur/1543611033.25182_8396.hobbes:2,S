The latest version is always available at 
http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/cml2/
Release 1.9.1: Tue Nov 27 13:29:50 EST 2001
	* Rulebase and help sync with 2.4.16/2.5.1-pre1 (except for SH port).
	* APIC rulebase correction by Damian M Gryski <dgryski@uwaterloo.ca>.
	* It is now possible to selectively suppress the emission of derived
	  symbols to the configuration file with an unless...suppress.
	* Improvements to compiler's well-formedness checking.
This folds in a couple of recent feature requests.
Keith Owens has reported a looping bug I can't reproduce -- the bug
log suggests that his CML2 rulebase is mis-installed somehow.  The bug
list is otherwise empty.  The to-do list is empty.

The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered as
the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since it offers a strong moral
check against usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers; and will generally,
even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist
and triumph over them."
        -- Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story of the John Marshall Court
