this is most likely because the getty's spawned by init can't find the tty
devices. You need to get devfsd, and configure it to make old compatibility
devices. Then adjust inittab.
Also, a question of my own, devfs (or devfsd) seems to assume glibc2.1
because even with compatibility enabled in devfsd things are broken. Eg,
telnetd can't find a pty, i had to mknod one before i could telnet in. Also
things like who/w show ?? as the login console. (except for telnet where i
created /dev/pty1)
