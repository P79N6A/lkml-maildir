Well, it's a little better, but it still died.  Just took longer.
However, this time, my kern.log got corrupted.  I saw 2 scheduling while
atomic errors in dmesg(before it locked up), but only one in kern.log, and a
bunch of random data(using ext3 data=writeback).  Symptoms this time around
were laggy keyboard handling, zombie processes(this may have been caused by
the scheduling while atomic problem), and ctrl-c not working.
I'll try again tomorrow, and hopefully get more data.
