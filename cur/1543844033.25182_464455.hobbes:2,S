Sort of.  The real trigger is that the PM core tries to suspend the 
upper-level PCI device but the lower-level root-hub device has not been 
suspended.  You saw this occurring because during the previous resume, the 
root-hub device's power.power_state.event was not updated, causing the PM 
core to think the root hub was still suspended when in fact it wasn't.

Believe it or not, these two paragraphs are closely connected.  The reason 
uhci-hcd doesn't use hcd->state at all is because there is no locking to 
protect it!
My feeling has long been that hcd->state deserves to disappear.  It tries 
to serve too many functions.  Please don't add any code in a futile 
attempt to preserve it.
