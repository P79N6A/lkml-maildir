I don't understand your comment.  Are you saying it's possible for two 
CPUs to observe the same two writes and see them occurring in opposite 
orders?

Again I don't follow.  If one CPU sees 1,2 and another sees 1,3 then there
are two possible global orderings: 1,2,3 and 1,3,2.  Both are consistent
with what each CPU sees.  If a third CPU sees 2,3 then the only consistent 
ordering is 1,2,3.
But in the example I gave there are no global orderings consistent with
all the observations.  Nevertheless, my example is isn't ruled out by what
Paul wrote.  So could my example arise on a real system?
