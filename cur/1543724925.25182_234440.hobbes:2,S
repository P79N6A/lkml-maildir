Speaking of which, can someone from SuSe somment on whether they use a
modified ReiserFS?  The tests I have been running (see my recent posts
to linux-kernel) showed some latency problems with reiserfs that I did
not see with ext3.  There was a latency-related thread on LKML in March
where Takashi mentioned a few changes to reiserfs that would give
excellent latency.
It seems very likely that with these changes, reiserfs is just as good
as ext3.  I have not heard much from the reiserfs advocates on this
issue.
