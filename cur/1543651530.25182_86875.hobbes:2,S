Oops, I forgot to fix the pnpbios proc interface for this problem.  I have
to look into it some more.  None the less this is not a big problem.  If
it boots you're in good shape.
Could you, however send me the output of lspnp for /proc/bus/pnp/boot/13.
This will not fault.  Also could you try lspnp on /proc/bus/pnp/14.  If
all is well this one should not fault.
by the way
/proc/bus/pnp/*.* = current
/proc/bus/pnp/boot/*.* = boot
current config has the problem but boot does not.  I'll work on a patch to
fix this.
Thanks,
Adam
