Previous stable kernel releases have seen a press release drafted on this
list.  I've not seen any such effort this time around, and I've actually
*read* most of the flood that has poured through here recently.  
The mainstream media has already made it clear that they're interested in
covering this kernel release.  Having a reasonably written press release
for them to read would likely improve the quality of that reporting
considerably.  Is anybody working on such a thing?
Of course, having raised the issue, I should now step forward to try to
address it :-).  I am actually willing to give it a shot, but there's no
way I can make a start on it until next week.  Depending on how quickly
Linus wants to move, that could be pushing the timing pretty hard.
Thoughts?
