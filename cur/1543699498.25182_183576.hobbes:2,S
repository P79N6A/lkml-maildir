Where does one get a copy of the SVR4 spec these days?  The link I could track 
down went to 
http://www.sco.com/developer/devspecs/
 which just ain't there no 
more.
And no, not because of a "DDOS".  There isn't one.  SCO's website IP moved 
from 216.250.128.13 to 216.250.128.20, and it's up at the new IP right now.  
They didn't get the new DNS record propogated on time.  Rookie mistake...
But looking at http.://216.250.128.20/developer/devspecs redirects you to the 
/developer page.  The devspecs page went away...
Is this mirrored somewhere?
