Hi Oliver, I agree, except that there are several layers of locking: dev->serialize
but also the bus rwsem.  So does "physical" mean no subsys.rwsem or no
dev->serialize or both?
Ciao, Duncan.
int usb_reset_device(struct usb_device *udev)
{
        struct device *gdev = &udev->dev;
        int r;
        down_read(&gdev->bus->subsys.rwsem);
        r = usb_physical_reset_device(udev);
        up_read(&gdev->bus->subsys.rwsem);
        return r;
}
