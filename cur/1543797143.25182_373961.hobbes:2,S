I'm unclear whether you rebooted after the "general protection fault"
and "NMI Watchdog" messages (if you had to, I'm sure you did, but I
don't know whether the machine appeared to work on after those).
If you didn't reboot, then discount these "Hangcheck" messages as a
consequence of the earlier errors, and reboot as soon as convenient.
It's interesting for me to see the Bad page state, Bad page state,
BUG in mm.h, BUG in rmap.c; but after those you ought to reboot.
If you did reboot, well, maybe related, but it doesn't tell us much.
