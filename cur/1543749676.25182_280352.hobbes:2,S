I wouldn't worry about the pid=0 issue -- I think it's most likely
due to the PAGG patches (
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/pagg
) causing
some sort of problem at process teardown (all the pid=0 processes are
in the process of exiting).
I'm more concerned about the (0 == pid & 0xffff) bug, which is present
in the unpatched mainline 2.4.x kernel.  It seems that the easiest fix
is marking such pids as in-use at pidmap allocation, so that they are
never assigned to real tasks.  I've got the code almost done, but need
to port it to top-of-tree before submitting a patch.
