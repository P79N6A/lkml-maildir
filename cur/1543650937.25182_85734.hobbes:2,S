When you have a correctable ECC error on a page you need to rewrite the
memory to remove the error.  This prevents the correctable error from becoming
an uncorrectable error if another bit goes bad.  Also if you have a
working software memory scrub routine you can be certain multiple
errors from the same address are actually distinct.  As opposed to
multiple reports of the same error.
