I see your point and I disagree.  The notes in a kernel generated 
core dump do not vary in size.  Find me some implementation evidence that
anyone ever added the extra 4 bytes of alignment to the description and the
padding fields and I will be ready to consider this.  Currently this
just appears to be reading a draft spec that doesn't match reality.
