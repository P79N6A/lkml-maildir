Nope.
I do not want to maintain two interfaces. If we make user space the way to
do these things, then we will do pretty much most of the driver setup etc
in user space. We'd have to: we'd enter user space before drivers have had
a chance to initialize, exactly because "features like these" can change
the device mappings etc.
And I don't want to have two completely different bootup paths.

You would never even know the difference. You'd do a "make bzImage", and
the default filesystem would just be embedded into the image. By default
it probably doesn't need to do much - although things like the BIOS DPMI
scan etc would surely be good to get rid of.
Why complain about that?
