?? x86_64 is Opteron cpu, amd64, Intel cpu?
Are the kernels running in 32bit or 64bit mode. I'm guessing
SMP Opterons running in 32bit mode.
Anyway one thing I want to do is actually drop the apic shutdown
code altogether in this code path.  I threw it in there to
ease the transition from the old code base to the new, but
if that code is causing issues....  So this is probably a good time
to start testing that.

My best hunch is that your UP kernel is not getting interrupts.
Any chance on getting a serial console boot log?  
I suspect it can be made to work if you compile your UP
kernel with IOAPIC support.  I do know the table parsers
no longer complain about the configuration.
