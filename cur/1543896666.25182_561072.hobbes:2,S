I agree. I would go on to suggest that all trivially-triggered oopsen /
panics from userspace (even if they require privileges, such as the
cat /dev/snapshot == oops issue posted last week) in fact ought to
be CVE's, and the corresponding fixes for such issues be considered
as candidates for -stable, if applicable to the current stable kernel.
