Hi there.
On looking through the configuration files, I came across a case where
it appears to be currently possible to select two mutually exclusive
options, namely the AppleTalk<=>IP recapsulation facility.
At the moment, the relevant part of the configuration file reads as
follows:
 Q> dep_tristate 'Appletalk-IP driver support' CONFIG_IPDDP $CONFIG_ATALK
 Q> if [ "$CONFIG_IPDDP" != "n" ]; then
 Q>    bool 'IP to Appletalk-IP Encapsulation support' CONFIG_IPDDP_ENCAP
 Q>    bool 'Appletalk-IP to IP Decapsulation support' CONFIG_IPDDP_DECAP
 Q> fi
The enclosed patch, as well as amending Configure.help accordingly,
changes this to read as follows, which I believe to be more rational:
 Q> dep_tristate 'Appletalk to IP driver support' CONFIG_IPDDP $CONFIG_ATALK
 Q> if [ "$CONFIG_IPDDP" != "n" ]; then
 Q>    choice '  Recapsulation support direction' \
 Q>          "Decapsulate   CONFIG_IPDDP_DECAP    \
 Q>           Encapsulate   CONFIG_IPDDP_ENCAP"   Decapsulate
 Q>  fi
Comments, anybody?
Best wishes from Riley.
