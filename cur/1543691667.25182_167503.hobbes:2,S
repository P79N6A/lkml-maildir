Hi all,
    I´m wrinting only to report that the new releases that start with 
patch-2.4.23-pre1 broken pcmcia support from pcmcia_cs packages. The 
error of not compile  pcmcia_cs is easy to correct only and #define 
CONFIG_NR_CPUS  in include/pcmcia/autoconf.h  (  pcmcia 2.3.5 ) or 
include/pcmcia/config.h ( in pcmcia_cs 2.3.4 ). But the problem is that 
result modules cant find devices.
     If I repeat exact the same process with 2.4.22 all work fine!  The 
motherboard that I tested was a A7S333. The device is a SWL-2100 ( 
Samsung 802.11b - Wireless board ). I was using with hostap driver. The 
pcmcia can find device and even locate right module and try load the 
module but cant bind. Below a except from /var/log/daemond.log:

Sep 21 12:36:04 eregon cardmgr[201]: executing: 'modprobe hostap_cs'
Sep 21 12:36:04 eregon cardmgr[201]: bind 'hostap_cs' to socket 0 
failed: Operation not permitted
      If I change ds.c in pcmcia package to ignore bind error i get :
Sep 21 20:46:16 eregon cardmgr[208]: get dev info on socket 0 failed: No 
such device
   My distribution is debian woody. I´m using now 2.4.22 with some 
patchs borrowed from 2.4.23-pre5, like  sch_htb.c  fix. Any way I would 
like report this problem.
Regards Rodrigo.
