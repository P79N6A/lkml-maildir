(please CC me when replying)
I just got a motherboard with the dual nic marvell chipset onboard.
Splendid board save for the driver issue I'm having :)  I'm currently
using 2.6.19-gentoo-r4 which doesn't have any forcedeth patch applied, a
vanilla kernel seems to give the same results.  This board is advertised
with the dual nics being capable of failover and teaming and other fancy
stuff.  I've disabled this gadgetry in BIOS setup however.
Every now and then  (and the period seems random) the NIC or driver
simply stops passing traffic [all the way] to userland or can't pass
packets from certain IPs.  I see both problems.  Sometimes the nic zones
out within a minute and sometimes it takes hours.
On eth1, the first nic, sits my cable modem.  It periodically loses all
connectivity and tcpdump only shows the outgoing ARP for the gateway.
Restarting dhcpcd on the interface fixes it perfectly.  ip link set eth1
down && then up does the same thing.  Traffic is immediately seen with
no reconfiguration.
On eth2, the second nic, I have a desktop switch.  The problem I see
there is that certain IPs can't be communicated with.  I.e. eth2 is
10.0.0.1/24 and my printer is 10.0.0.15/24.  It's been 10.0.0.15 for
years.  If I try to ping it, ping never sees an ICMP answer however
tcpdump shows both the echo and echo_reply.  Changing the IP to
10.0.0.12 and it is immediately pingable.  Restarting the interface has
no effect.  It doesn't matter what device I put 10.0.0.15 on, it's not
reachable.
No iptable rules on eth2 and only outbound SNAT to the interface's IP on
eth1.  That is about the extent of firewalling.  No fancy options in
/proc and no IP mgt daemons other than standard dhcpcd.
There is nothing in dmesg to indicate anything is amiss.  There is
nothing in dhcp log, syslog, etc, to indicate anything has changed.  For
the moment I have a 60 second loop to restart eth1 but it's a bit of a
bother to have everything stall frequently.
Any "me toos" out there, any suggestions?
