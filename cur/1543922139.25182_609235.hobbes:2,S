I don't.  Strings should never be as long as 2GB.  To put this in
perspective, the *entire* Encyclopaedia Britannica (all 32 volumes)
is estimated at being 1GB of text.
While it would be a fair criticism that I haven't put a check for
overrunning 2GB in the code, the implementation relies on a single
continuous buffer from kmalloc, and that's currently limited to 33554432
bytes (32MB).  I don't foresee kmalloc's maximum size going up by 7
orders of magnitude -- and if it did, fragmentation would prevent you
from ever getting it.
So, I might consider a change to set -E2BIG instead of -ENOMEM if we
pass KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE, but I do think this criticism is rather straining
at gnats.
Also, 'alloc' can be an errno, and that is signalled by a negative number.
Yes, we could do something like if (sb->alloc > (unsigned)-4095) like
the mmap code does, but given the points above, it's just not worth doing.
