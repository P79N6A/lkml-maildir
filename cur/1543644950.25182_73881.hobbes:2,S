Subject: cramfs: wrong magic when loading ramdisk from floppy

I'm trying to load a cramfs filesystem as a ramdisk from a floppy.  After I am 
prompted to insert the floppy with the ramdisk image, and the kernel 
acknowledges that it found a compressed image, I get the message:
cramfs: wrong magic
and then the kernel panics.
What I am trying to do is to use a regular PC to estimate the amount of RAM and 
flash ROM an embedded project will require, so I'm loading a cramfs image from 
floppy that will be similar to the cramfs image that will be loaded into flash. 
  I'm also booting a kernel with only enough options selected to boot and use 
the console, ramdisk, cramfs and floppy disk.  It's otherwise a stock 2.4.19 kernel.
I added a line to fs/cramfs/inode.c to print out the magic that it's seeing, and 
it is 0xf6f6f6f6, which is not correct.
I'm using syslinux on a FAT floppy for my bootloader.  The contents of 
syslinux.cfg are:
DEFAULT linux root=/dev/fd0 init=/bin/sh load_ramdisk=1 prompt_ramdisk=1
Thanks for any help you can give me.
Mike
