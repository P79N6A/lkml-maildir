Subject: [PATCH 0/6] checkpatch checks for trailing semicolons on conditionals

A couple of people suggested adding checks to checkpatch for trailing
semicolons on conditionals, where the conditional block may not be
actually conditional:
	if (err);
		return err;
While regression testing the changes, I ran these checks across the
whole of 2.6.23-rc3 and there appear to be 5 places where this is
occurs (above and beyond the IPv6 one which triggered this effort)
and a benign use which could be confused later which it seems safest
to fix.
Following this email are 6 patches for these issues, relevant
maintainers cc'd.  All against 2.6.23-rc3
