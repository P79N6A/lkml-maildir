Alan,
Somewhere between -ac14 and -ac16, the following appeared:
--- linux/include/asm-s390/pgtable.h~	Fri Sep 28 20:54:54 2001

 /* Needs to be defined here and not in linux/mm.h, as it is arch dependent */
 #define kern_addr_valid(addr)   (1)
 
-/*

-#define pgtable_cache_init()	do { } while (0)
-
 #endif /* _S390_PAGE_H */
 
So, I decided to check for pgtable_cache_init in arch/s390 and
include/asm-s390 but couldn't find it - I guess this is a mismerge
or something the S390 people missed.
pgtable_cache_init() must be implemented in all architectures.  Any
that don't implement it must make the call a no-op as per the original
pgtable.h.
