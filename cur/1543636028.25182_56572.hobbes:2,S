I never said this.
I would like to see a integrated aproach where the mid level prevents something
like ide-cd to access ATAPI drives. In this case, there is a unique address 
space and generic SCSI transport systems like libscg will be able to work
in a way that is easy to understand by outsiders and does not force me to add
one workaround after the other.
