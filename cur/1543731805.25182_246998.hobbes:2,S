I just wanted to call your attention to the kallsyms speedup patch that 
is now on the -mm tree.
It should improve wchan speed. My benchmarks for kallsyms_lookup (the 
function that was responsible for the wchan time) went from 1340us to 0.5us.
So maybe this is enough not to make wchan a special case anymore...
