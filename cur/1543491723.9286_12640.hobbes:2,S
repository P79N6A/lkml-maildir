If the kernel doesn't perform the #3 check then your system will not
function correctly without a setuid binary.
Look at it this way:
You already have a setuid-root binary.
This hack lets you reduce it to be merely a capability-enhanced binary.
If you boot an old kernel, you are back to the original condition.
With the other system, you simply must not ever use an old kernel.
You would have filesystem trouble (files you can't safely remove)
and general app failure (inability to use privs). At least my solution
lets you boot an old low-security kernel if you need to.

Yes, but that doesn't excuse privileged executables that are needlessly
difficult to detect.

No kidding. You don't just let anybody make setuid-root executables.
Don't think "acquire these privs", since a setuid-root executable
already has _more_ privs with Linux 2.2.5. It would lose some of them.

The kernel already checks for this. (you can't make a setuid-root bin)

The kernel already has a process flag to handle this.

Yes, we _could_ extend ext2. Then we need to extend everything else,
from NFS to tar. That includes non-Linux NFS servers.

Any process can write to a setuid-root executable? You have a serious
security problem that you should fix.
BTW, the header could be quite powerful:
euid =   (left as the user)
ruid =   (left as the user)
suid = sybase
fsuid = mail
extragroups = foo, bar, baz
P_priv = CAP_FOO, CAP_BAR, CAP_BAZ
E_priv = CAP_FOO, CAP_WHATEVER, CAP_XYZ
I_priv = CAP_FOO, CAP_USEFUL_THING, CAP_STUFF
