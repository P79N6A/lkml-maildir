Yup. I always try to avoid nesting if's tho, which is why I wrote it
that way :) But yes, it should be fixed.

Yah, yah, I know :) will fix. I'm not sure there is point signaling the
error to the PCI layer. It won't do anything good with it.

Hehe, yes, but I don't like it :)
Thanks. I spotted a few other issues (I was quite tired yesterday when I
finished this code). I'll do another pass on it today. One thing is: I
don't have x86 hardware, or at least, nothing where I can have 2 VGA
cards in (I may have access to an old laptop). So I'll need help &
testers at one point.
Ben.
