It's also not a bad idea to sometimes say "Linux cannot do that".  Trying
to make the system do _everything_ will result in it doing many things very
poorly.

} ... the worst-case-behaviour is basically impossible to trigger with any 
} real load. 
} 
} The worst case does not happen for "100k threads" like you've made it 
} sound like.
} 
} The worst case happens for "100k threads consecutive in the pid space".
} 
} Which means that not only do you have to roll over, you have to roll over 
} with a humungous number of threads _still_ occupying their old consecutive 
} positions when you roll over.
} 
} I repeat: you're making up schenarios that simply have no relevance to 
} real life.
