Then I guess I had the same problem then Andreas Dietrich, where windows
thinks he had formatted a partition, but never did, and was actually
writing to an other.
It was hda4 for me, which was about 9 GB, and was unable to mount it. I
made a extended partition of hda4 instead (inside win 98, didn't like
linux extended partition), and put a 2 GB logical on it. I formatted it,
and had to come to the conculusion that it formatted hda1 (my linux root).
I just made hda4 an ext2 now.
