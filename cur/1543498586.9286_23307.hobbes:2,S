OK.  Then to review, here is the output I get during a boot.  (Most of this scrolls by
too fast to read, but I captured it with my video camera:

Now this is where it freezes the computer, so even the power button locks up.  Fortunately
someone on this list pointed out the feature if I hold down on the button for 4 seconds
the machine will turn off anyway.
In comparison, this is what I get when I boot with 2.0.36 as recorded in /var/adm/boot.msg:

If the 2.0 and 2.2 kernels initialize in the same order, the next thing I expected to see
from the 2.2 kernel would be the equivalent of:
<4>hda: WDC AC22100H, 2014MB w/128kB Cache, CHS=1022/64/63, DMA
<4>hdb: Maxtor 91360D8, 12970MB w/256kB Cache, CHS=1653/255/63, UDMA
<4>hdc: TOSHIBA DVD-ROM SD-M1202, ATAPI CDROM drive
So, I expect it is freezing in the code that detects the hard drive geometry...
I have tried a variety of configuration options when compiling my kernel, but a quick
calculations shows, if I try all possable combinations of the IDE/PCI bus options, I'll
have 128 kernels to compile and try booting.
Versions of the kernel I have tried, to boot that have this problem:
	2.1.115
	2.1.122
	2.2.5.SuSE
	2.2.7.SuSE
	2.2.0-pre7
	Most of the precompiled SuSE 2.2.X kernels from SuSE 6.0 and 6.1.
	(several other versions, I didn't bother to save a record of my attempt.)

The SCSI bus only contains a scanner.  So, if you thing that might be a source of problems
I can easily eliminate it from my selected compile options.

I'm not blaiming SuSE.  I'm certain I'd have the same problem with ANY linux distribution
that uses the 2.2 kernel, or even if I wasn't using a distribution at all.
