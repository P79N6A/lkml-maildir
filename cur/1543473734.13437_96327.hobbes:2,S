Subject: 2.2.0-pre2: "smp_found_config undeclared" compile error

Compiling Linus' 2.2.0-pre2 with CONFIG_M686 in uni-processor mode
gives:
/usr/src/linux-2.2/include/asm/bugs.h: In function `check_config':
In file included from init/main.c:27:
/usr/src/linux-2.2/include/asm/bugs.h:354: `smp_found_config' undeclared (first use this function)
I guess the check is only interesting in an SMP configuration, 
so perhaps this patch will work ? Or should CONFIG_GOOD_APIC
be set only when CONFIG_SMP is set ?
