Subject: [patch] touch_buffer in getblk
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Currently we do touch_buffer in brelse instead of in getblk. It make sense
to mark the page referenced in getblk so we'll less probably enter the
try_to_free_buffers path. Also it's possible to cleanup the fast-path of
getblk.
This patch against 2.3.17 will do that:
