No relation to this here: BSS is file scope and local static variables,
what you are saying applies to automatic variables. There probably are a
lot of "static flag = 0;"s around, mostly for documentation purposes.
In any case, I'd recommend checking what the compiler does in such a case
(it places initialized data into the DATA segment here, regardless of
value), then ask the GCC folks nicely to place data items that are
explicitly initialized with 0 into BSS.
