Subject: 2.6.20-rc3 regression: suspend to RAM broken on Mac mini Core Duo

Hi folks,
I tried 2.6.20-rc3 and suspend to RAM is now broken. The screen stays
dark after resume, the same with the network link. It worked with
2.6.18 (I skipped 2.6.19 because of a regression in the sky2 driver).
I enabled pm_trace and did a echo mem > /sys/power/state in single user
mode.
After the reboot, all I got from pm_trace is this:
ACPI: (supports S0 S3 S4 S5)
  Magic number: 0:798:636
  hash matches drivers/base/power/resume.c:46
Freeing unused kernel memory: 228k freed
This is line 46 in resume.c:
	TRACE_RESUME(error);
No information about the device/driver that refuses to resume.
I think that this is a regression, as it worked with 2.6.18 and the
kernel config is the same. The hardare is a Mac mini Core Duo.
Regards,
Tino
