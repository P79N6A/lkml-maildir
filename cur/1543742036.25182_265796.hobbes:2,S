Since you haven't paid for the product, copyright law applies and
that's quite different than contract law.  You get a certain set
of rights, which vary worldwide, when you buy something.  Copyright
is far more restrictive.
"Fair use" != "reverse engineering" in any venue so far as I know.
As always, IANAL, so contact yours for clarification.
