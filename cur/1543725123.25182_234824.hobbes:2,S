I had the same on Digital Celebris 5133. One debian Woody boot floppy I
tried (don't remember which flavour) gave exactly this. Debian Sarge
boot floppies worked fine.
Additionally, lilo didn't work, just hung.
Grub does work but something (BIOS?) garbles some of the kernel command
line. I used the following kernel command line as a workaround:
abrakadabra my_real_options...
and this became
PAMSkadabra my_real_options...
Other than that it worked fine - Pentium 133, 64M RAM, onboard Adaptec
SCSI, onboard Matrox video.
