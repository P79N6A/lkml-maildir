It's no longer preferred style in ALSA.
xxx_t had been used for the magic type-cast checks.  But this check
was removed, and there is no reason to stick with its style. 
I'm using struct foo in the recent drivers like hd-audio, too.
Tons of *_t are still there just because of laziness :)
Seriously, if you guys want to clean up them, I wouldn't reject at
all.  But this clean up is at the very tail of my TODO list ;)

But still you have to set a 32bit (bus) address to the buffer
descriptor of this chip.  If you get higher than that, it won't work
anyway.

Well, it's not ALSA style, too.  We prefer often like
	foo_write(chip, reg, val)
expanded to
	outl(val, (chip)->port + (reg))
but don't assume local variables.
