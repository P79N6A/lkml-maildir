it disalllows
int fd = sys_kevent_ctl(<random>, KEVENT_CTL_INIT, <random>, <random>);
in favour of only
int fd = open("/dev/kevent", O_SOMETHING);
which doesn't seem like a problem, especially as I really badly hope
no one will use the syscalls but some library instead.
In addition to that I'm researching whether there's a better way to
implement the other functionality instead of the two syscalls.  But I'd
rather let code speak, so wait for some patches from me on that.
