Are you suggesting that whatever's calling sys_vm86 has disabled
interrupts beforehand? I don't see why that's necessary at all. The
vm86 fault handler is called via do_general_protection in any case and
as such is in_interrupt() by definition. And a vm86 general protection
fault can be caused by any of cli, sti, pushf, popf, intx, or iret. In
fact, typical usage of vm86 mode is to setup a call to a 16-bit
software interrupt handler and return via fault on the iret.
I'm increasingly convinced it's actually broken.
