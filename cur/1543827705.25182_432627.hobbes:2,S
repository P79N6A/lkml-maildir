Further to this, the current behaviour is badly unpredictable.
A machine could be working perfectly, not (noticeably) affected
by this bug.  And then the user adds another stick of RAM to it.
Poof.. many sites from the internet stop responding.
Obviously the RAM upgrade broke things.. must be bad RAM, right?
Err.. no, the networking stack simply decided to become incompatible
with certain sites, as a result of the user adding more RAM to their machine.
