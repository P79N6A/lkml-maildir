I've got a hash table of packet manipulation information
I need to use inside of a module in my kernel. The problem
is that this hash table is around 2MB. I'm trying to figure
out ways to shrink this table, but I'm coming up short on
ideas. What would be a good way to be able to allocate enough
memory to store all of this information?
