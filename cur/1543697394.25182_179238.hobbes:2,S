When running 2.4.0-test9 on my Thinkpad T20 the HDD LED usually stays on all
the time.  It seems random, some boots the LED will operate normally, but
most boots the LED will go on continually.
The system otherwise operates normally (all the data is correctly read and
written on the hard disk).
I have an IDE hard disk using DMA.  I have attached the kernel config I am 
using (no patches were applied to the kernel source).
2.4.x kernels work perfectly on the same machine.
