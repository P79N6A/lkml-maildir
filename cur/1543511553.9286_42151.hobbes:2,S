Hi Wakko,
This would be caused by libcurses installations on the systems in
question.  It sounds like a funky mismatch between your curses.h or
ncurses.h and the curses libraries.
You might want to mess around with linking scripts/lxdialog/lxdialog
with "-static" on a working machine and copying that lxdialog over
to your broken machine.
