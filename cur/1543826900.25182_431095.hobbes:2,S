You give the impression that you would just disappear from the face of
the planet should your work actually be integrated into the kernel
tree.
So I can only assume that you are posting this for people to play
around with, and not for serious consideration of inclusion into the
kernel tree.
We're trying to avoid this serious problem we have where a group or
individual submits on a piece of code, works just hard enough to get
it integrated into the tree, then disappears and does not stick around
to support the inevitable ensuing bugs and problem reports.  Such
behavior is totally irresponsible, yet it happens quite a bit.
So if you can't be bothered to cook up IPV6 support, chances are you
won't stick around to support your code if it went into the tree
either.
