yes. And eventually to make sure regions don't overlap.

Current PARISC servers do not allocate MMIO/IO resources for all PCI devices.
Only boot devices are configured. Fortunately, default MMIO/IO address
space assigned to Host bridges seems to work - at least I've not heard
anyone complain (yet). But no one has tried PCI expansion chassis or
cards with massive (> 64MB) MMIO BARs.
Because of PCI hotplug, rumor is ia64 firmware folks want to do
the same thing in the near future.

That's reasonable.
pci arch code also has hooks to fixup host bridge resources.
