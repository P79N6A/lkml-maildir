It will if we're booting out of bzImage; the bss won't be clear in that
case.

The problem is not the reloads themselves, but what you're reloading
them with.  If we come up under Xen, then it will provide a default GDT
and pre-load the segments with flat 4G(-ish) selectors - but the
selectors won't be the normal Linux ones.
So if we reload using a constant selector, then that will break under
Xen. But if we do a:
    mov %cs, %eax
    mov %eax, %ds
    // etc
sequence then it should be fine.  This will work even for loading %ss,
since the %cs CPL will equal the RPL needed for %ss.
