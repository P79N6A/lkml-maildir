Hello Matt,
> Which server please?
PE 2600 manufactured in June with latest PC BIOS and SCSI (PERC4/DI)
BIOS/Firmware. We also tried downgrading to the previous release (as we have
another PE2600 which runs fine with them) but it didn't do.
Add-ons are :
- Adaptec SCSI controller
- Total 3 Intel Pro 1000 Ethernet cards
About the other PE2600, it has the same hardware configuration, but not
exactly the same usage : more memory allocated to processes and far less I/O
loads. Although I'm not always satisfied with its performances, we didn't
notice something special on it so far.
Regards,
Sylvain.
