Subject: [PATCH] Make Documentation/kobject.txt a little more coherent.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

While reading Documentation/kobject.txt:

  what names are valid so the provide must provide their own sanity checking
  and serialization.
I expect better: You never see me hard with time word making sentence
coherent stuff.  Ever.
