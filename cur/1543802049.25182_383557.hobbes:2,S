Subject: [PATCH/RFC] POLLHUP tinkering ...
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Some time ago there was a discussion about adding a simple flag to the 
Linux poll subsystem, to signal half-closed links during read operations and 
epoll:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2003/7/12/116
The problem for users of EPOLLET is that they rely on a shorter-than-buffersize
read to detect the end of the currant payload, and go back to wait for events 
again. What they do is basically (in a very simplified way), once EPOLLIN is 
received:
 	do {
 		n = read(fd, buf, bufsiz);
 		...
 	} while (n == bufsiz);
But if and hangup happened with some data (data + FIN), they won't receive any 
more events for the Linux poll subsystem (and epoll, when using the event 
triggered interface), so they are forced to issue an extra read() after the 
loop to detect the EOF condition. Besides from the extra read() overhead, 
the code does not come exactly pretty. During the last few months I 
received quite a few messages from dudes asking me why, after a 
substantial agreement, that kind of patch has never been implemented. 
After looking at the code yesterday, I realized that there is not need of 
extra flags, and a correct POLLHUP reporting from f_op->poll() can do it.
Linux almost everywhere reports the POLLHUP in a way that is useful for 
EPOLLET users, with only few exceptions. In those few places the full 
SHUTDOWN_MASK is expected in order to report POLLHUP, whereas the simple 
RCV_SHUTDOWN would be sufficent to detect a shutdown peer. When 
RCV_SHUTDOWN is set, the outbound data channel is definitely shutdown, so 
POLLHUP is deserved in such condition. Returning POLLHUP upon RCV_SHUTDOWN 
would automatically solve the above problem, and won't conflict with the 
SUS definition of POLLHUP:
[POLLHUP]
The device has been disconnected. This event and POLLOUT are mutually 
exclusive; a stream can never be writable if a hangup has occurred. 
However, this event and POLLIN, POLLRDNORM, POLLRDBAND or POLLPRI are not 
mutually exclusive. This flag is only valid in the revents bitmask; it is 
ignored in the events member.
With that in place, EPOLLET users can simply check for the EPOLLHUP flag 
returned, and yank the session w/out extra cumbersome code.
The attached patch is against 2.6.15-git4. Comments?
