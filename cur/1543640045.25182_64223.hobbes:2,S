Hello!
> Comments welcome.
I do not know what forced you to use BKL.
But I daresay this is deadlock:
+       lock_kernel();
+       error = f_setown(filp, current->pid);
+       unlock_kernel();
        if (error) {
                write_unlock(&dn_lock);
                return error;
Use of BKL when another spin lock is grabbed... It will deadlock
each time when some dcahe op is made under BKL.
