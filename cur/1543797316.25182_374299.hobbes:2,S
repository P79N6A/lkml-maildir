Well, if the USB developers are already keeping a list of "known
good/known bad" devices, and the IEEE 1394 people are maintaining such
a list, and the ALSA people are maintaining a list, wouldn't it make
sense to just have some sort of agregation method to present a
centralized front end to the information? A distributed hardware
matrix as it were?
Seems wise, in order to avoid the problem that Arjan mentioned, to
have developers closest to the drivers to be the primary maintainers
of the info. Users are obviously going to be an important source of
information, but having random users editing a wiki page with "works
great for me," "doesn't work at all for me"-style comments appears
less helpful than a matrix maintained w/ input from users (where input
from users is primarily though the bug reporting process or something
else a little more disciplined than unqualified affirmative or
negative blurbs).
