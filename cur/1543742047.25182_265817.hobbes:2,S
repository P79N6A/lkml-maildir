  I got a very nice mail from Jesse Brandeburg saying pretty much the
  same thing...  so, I've pushed kernels for around 75 boxen over to
  e100 today, from eepro100.  I'm not _quite_ sure when I'll have the
  chance to boot them all, but when they do, and if they have
  problems, I'll report back.
