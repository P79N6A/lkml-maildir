Don't get me started on nt - saying it "just works" is a sign of
genuine naivete - You could say nt "usually works, except for
when it's down".  Your sendmail issue with Linux was merely a
tunable parameter, while the nt problems go much deeper, and
nt often requires regular reboots in order to carry on.
