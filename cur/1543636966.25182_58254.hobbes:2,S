it does precisely what it says:
    irq_off()           => turn local IRQs off
    irq_on()            => turn local IRQs on
    irq_save(flags)     => save the current IRQ state into flags. The 
                           state can be on or off. (on some 
                           architectures there's even more bits in it.)
    irq_save_off(flags) => save the current IRQ state into flags and 
                           disable interrupts.
    irq_restore(flags)  => restore the IRQ state from flags.
while it's true that 'normally' we save irq-enabled state, it's not at all
sure, eg. when nested irq_save() is done then the first flags will carry
an irqs-on bit, the other nested flags will carry an irqs-off flag - and
the nested irq_restore() will restore to irqs-off state.
this is how it has worked in the past 10 years or so.
but i've added this description to the cli-sti guide :-) Check out the -D7
