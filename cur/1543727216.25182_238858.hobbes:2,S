Subject: [PATCH] ppc32: Fix 'mktree' on 64bit hosts
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
The following patch changes some 'unsigned long's into 'uint32_t's in
mktree (a program that runs on the host to frob the kernel image for
some firmwares).  Without it, the program is not correct when run
on/compiled on a 64bit host.
