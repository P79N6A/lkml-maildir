Maintaining a long-term reference on a page is a problem. The GRU does not
currently maintain tables to track the pages for which dropins have been done.
The GRU has a large internal TLB and is designed to reference up to 8PB of
memory. The size of the tables to track this many referenced pages would be
a problem (at best).
