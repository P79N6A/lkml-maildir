Actually my problem with big writes was the bk kernel I downloaded was
a rev too early (2.6.7-bk7 ?).
I tested the sata_sil.c version from June 25 (via bk checkout)
extensively and had no problem... posted my results then, hdparm
reported ~42 - 51 MB/sec, and never a write block.
Today I try putting 2.6.8.1 on the box and I'm getting ~14 MB/sec, the
drive has been added to the sil_blacklist. Why? What did I miss?
I've taken my drive out of the black list, abused it with 5 continuous
writes and "top id 0" no problem after 58Gb. I'm doing it again this
time simultaneously with a massive rm -rf of backup directories. I
really don't anticipate a problem.
So what's up with 
         /*{ "ST3160023AS",      SIL_QUIRK_MOD15WRITE },*/
before it got in there, it was said the black list "would not grow"
(for unexplained reasons).
