In my opinion, moving all the asm-stuff greatly improved readability
of the source code.  Especially for folks who are not intimately
familiar with GCC asm syntax (which is hairy _and_ platform-specific).

I think the jury is out on this one.  Clearly it's a huge benefit if
you can make do without inline asm.  GCC has to make lots of
worst-case assumptions whenever it encounters an asm statement and,
due to macros and inlining, the asm statements are not just hidden in
a few leaf routines.  In my opinion, this experiment is at least worth
a try.  If it succeeds, great, if it fails (e.g., the Intel compiler
folks fail to keep up with the kernel), all we have to do is
rm intel_intrin.h.
