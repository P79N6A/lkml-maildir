Subject: [ANNOUNCE] 2003-05-01 release of hotplug scripts
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I've just packaged up the latest Linux hotplug scripts into a release,
which can be found at:
 	
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17679
Or from your favorite kernel.org mirror at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/hotplug-2003_05_01.tar.gz
or for those who like bz2 packages:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/hotplug-2003_05_01.tar.bz2
I've also packaged up some pre-built (and signed) Red Hat 7.3 based rpms:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/hotplug-2003_05_01-1.noarch.rpm
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/hotplug-base-2003_05_01-1.noarch.rpm
The source rpm is available if you want to rebuild it for other distros
or versions of Red Hat at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/hotplug-2003_05_01-1.src.rpm
The main web site for the linux-hotplug project can be found at:
	
http://linux-hotplug.sf.net/
which contains lots of documentation on the whole linux-hotplug
process.
There are lots of changes in this release from the last one (which was
almost 8 months ago), most of them make things work better for systems
running 2.5, but some of them fix problems that 2.4 users will see.
Some of the major changes in this release are:
	- fix for the lack of a drivers file in usbfs in 2.5.
	- initial scsi.agent for 2.5, modprobes sd_mod or sr_mod
	- call devlabel if it's present
	- made /sbin/hotplug a tiny multiplexer program, moving the original
	  /sbin/hotplug program to /etc/hotplug.d/default/default.hotplug
The full ChangeLog extract since the last release is included below for
those who want to know everything that's been changed, and who to blame
for them :)
thanks,

	- 2003_05_01 release
	- made /sbin/hotplug a tiny multiplexer program, moving the original
	  /sbin/hotplug program to /etc/hotplug.d/default/default.hotplug
	- split the rpms generated into two: hotplug and hotplug-base.
	  hotplug-base contains /sbin/hotplug and /etc/hotplug.d/ only
	  hotplug contains everything else
	  hotplug depends on hotplug-base to be present to be able to be
	  loaded.

	- from Dan Dennedy <dan@dennedy.org>, firewire agent now loads
	  multiple modules.  video control and data can be separate.
Fri Jan 17 2003 dbrownell
	- call devlabel if it's present; <Gary_Lerhaupt@Dell.com>
Thu Dec 12 2002 dbrownell
	- handle some sysfs timing and sequencing quirks
	- if it's there, sysfs can provide some missing usb data
Mon Dec  2 2002 dbrownell
	- update README
	- updates from suse's patches
	- DEBUG messages should be off by default!
	- clean up "make install"
	- LSB says init scripts in /etc/init.d, and handle 'force-reload'
Fri Nov 29 2002 dbrownell
	- initial scsi.agent for 2.5, modprobes sd_mod or sr_mod
Wed Nov 21 2002 dbrownell
    more updates for 2.5 kernels:
	- handle additional "device mode" usb hotplug, ignoring it for now
	  unless /sys/$DEVPATH/bNumConfigurations says we have choice of
	  configurations (the first one might not be best).
	- handle the improved "interface mode" usb hotplug in 2.5: don't
	  use 'usbmodules', each interface gets its own event report.
	- don't slow down usb hotplug, all hcds now do control queueing.
	- flag usb and pci 'coldplug' cleanups, needed now that we can
	  finally eliminate usbmodules (pcimodules too?)
    other fixes:
	- patch from <Reinhold.May@gmx.de> to address fact that usbmodules
	  can fail where the script parsing works
	- /sbin/hotplug can now save events to a logfile for later use,
	  suitable for debugging, collecting as test data, sending to a
	  daemon, and so on.
	- better fix for 'always run setup scripts', handling cases where
	  modprobe fails until the setup script renumerates to new usb ids.
	- usb.rc, comment the usbdevfs versioning issue (counting files in
	  /proc/bus/usb became fragile recently) and handle some similar
	  config-dependent startup issues
Tue Oct 1 2002 kroah
	- fix for the lack of a drivers file in usbfs in 2.5.  Patch is from
	  Duncan Sands <duncan.sands@wanadoo.fr>
