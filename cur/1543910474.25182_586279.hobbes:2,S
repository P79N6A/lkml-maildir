No. You started out by saying you have this great idea
that you want somebody else to develop. This met with
strong resistance of course, because linux-kernel
developers don't work for you.
If you were to create some new "thinking out-of-the-box"
file system, you could include it into Linux just as all
the other file-systems have been included (it started
with minix). If it was truly useful, it might even get
included into the main-line distributions if you
maintained it.
People are not openly hostile to new ideas. They are openly
hostile to being abused.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
