 One way to find new features is to use "make oldconfig".
 Say you are comparing kernels 2.6.14 and 2.6.15, trying to see what
is new.  Just do this:
 1.  Copy a .config file into your 2.6.14 directory.
 2.  Run "make oldconfig" there.  It doesn't really matter what
     answers you give so long as it runs to completion.
 3.  Copy that .config file to your 2.6.15 directory.
 4.  When you run "make oldconfig" all of the new features, drivers
     etc. will cause a prompt.
 5.  There will be some false positives if options have been renamed
     or moved around, but it's generally accurate.
