But is this not exactly what Dag Arne Osvik was trying to do ?? 
uint_fast32_t means that we want at least 32 bits but it's OK with more
if that happens to be faster on this particular architecture.  The
problem was that the C99 standard types are not defined anywhere in the
kernel headers so they can not be used.
Perhaps they should be added to asm/types.h ?
