I think this is an excellent idea. To help with this I'll
gather all non-bug VM patches and combine them into a
special big patch periodically.
Once we are sure 2.4 is stable for just about anybody I
will submit some of the really trivial enhancements for
inclusion; all non-trivial patches I will maintain in a
VM bigpatch, which will be submitted for inclusion around
2.5.0 and should provide one easy patch for those distribution
vendors who think 2.4 VM performance isn't good enough for
them ;)
regards,
Rik
