That was close.

So it seems I'm afraid: With the version of this patch that just went
in, Jan Beulich <jbeulich@novell.com> found a bug when building
vmlinux.lds on i386. He triggered it by by putting poisoned version.h and
autoconf.h files in /usr/src/linux.
With the additional changes (rediff against linux-2.6.13-git6
below), things work as expected. There may be a slightly
more minimalistic solution that also works --- I didn't want to risk
strange failures.
(To not confuse people, let me add that this all doesn't matter if the
source tree is distclean.)
Cheers,
Andreas.
