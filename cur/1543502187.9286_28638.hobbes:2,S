I honestly can't believe that this is going on for so long.  I don't
think applications are already too slow.  What applications?  I don't
see any problems with the current way of doing things.
parsing conf files is slow?  Where'd anybody get that idea from.  How
often do you parse conf files?
I'm just failing to see what the fuss is about.  If anyone can
enlighten me I'd appreciate it...
