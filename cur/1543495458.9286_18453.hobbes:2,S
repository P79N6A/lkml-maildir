Subject: [2.2.8] undefined reference __skb_push in ethertap.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

The patch from 2.2.7 to 2.2.8 in the file drivers/net/ethertap.c
in function ethertap_start_xmit replaces a call to skb_push with a
call to __skb_push.
make zImage returns an undefined reference error for __skb_push in the
link phase. 
grepping the complete kernel source tree, I can find no other
reference of __skb_push.
