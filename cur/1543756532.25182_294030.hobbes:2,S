If that's the requirement, then it's broken as is, because there is
nothing accumulating.  len is re-determined each pass, and charge is
reset each pass.  But I think that it's ok, as we only care about the
last pass.  If dup_mmap() fails part way through, the cleanup path should
call unaccount for the (potentially) accounted by not fully setup vma then
call exit_mmap() and clear all the vmas that got accounted for already.
Either way, Mark's patch is not needed, and I don't think anything needs
patching in this area.  Hugh, do you agree?
thanks,
