Does not work here on a Dell R400VT with a TI PCI1225 controller. The
controller is detected twice and network connectivty with the Xircom
Combi-Card is not there. (As a matter of fact i can not log into the
system when it is up, because the keyboard/mouse will not react. This
is different fron pre5, but might be caused by the fact that i had
USB configured...) 
I'll try to recompile with minimum configuration next...
BTW: The cardbus changes(?) break the alpha, because pci_assign_resource()
is non-existant there, removing the EXPORTed symbol for this function results
in a working kernel so (on NONAME w/o PCMCIA support)...
Yours,
  Dominik Kubla
