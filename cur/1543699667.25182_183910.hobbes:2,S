Possibly. But it restricts your load balancing to a specific case, it
eliminates any possibility of CPU affinity: 4 running threads on 1 HT
CPU for example, they'll ping pong from one cpu to the other happily.
I could get domains to do the same thing, but at the moment a CPU only looks
at its sibling's runqueue if they are unbalanced or is about to become idle.
I'm pretty sure domains can do anything shared runqueues can. I don't know
if you're disputing this or not?

(Plus two threads / siblings per CPU, right?)
I agree with you here. You know, we could rename struct sched_domain, add
a few fields to it and it becomes what you want. Its a _heirachical set_
of _sets of cpus sharing a certian property_ (underlining to aid grouping.
Uniform access to certian memory ranges could easily be one of these
properties. There is already some info about the amount of cache shared,
that also could be expanded on.
(Perhaps some exotic architecture  would like scheduling and memory a bit
more decoupled, but designing for *that* before hitting it would be over
engineering).
I'm not going to that because 2.6 doesn't need a generalised topology
because nothing makes use of it. Perhaps if something really good came up
in 2.7, there would be a case for backporting it. 2.6 does need improvements
to the scheduler though.

But if sched domains are accepted, there is no need for shared runqueues,
because as I said they can do anything sched domains can, so the code would
just be a redundant specialisation - unless you specifically wanted to share
locks & data with siblings.
I must admit I didn't look at your implementation. I look forward to it.
I'm not against shared runqueues. If my stuff doesn't get taken then of
course I'd rather shrq gets in than nothing at all, as I told Ingo. I
obviously just like sched domains better ;)
