These patches are very similar to what I posted at

In my patches, the thread group leader owns the mm_struct and all
threads belong to the same container. I did not have a per container
LRU, walking the global list for reclaim was a bit slow, but otherwise
my patches did not add anything to struct page
I used rmap information to get to the VMA and then the mm_struct.
Kirill, it is possible to determine all the containers that map the
page. Please see the page_in_container() function of
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/26/7.
I was also thinking of using the page table(s) to identify all pages
belonging to a container, by obtaining all the mm_structs of tasks
belonging to a container. But this approach would not work well for
the page cache controller, when we add that to our memory controller.
