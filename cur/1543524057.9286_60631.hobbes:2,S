FWIW, I have been having very similar problems with this CardBus NIC in
some Compaq Armada laptops we recently started using at work. I'm using
IRQ 7 for the cards - it seemed to be the only one that would work at
all - and whenever there is some load of the network, I get a driver
message that the transmission timed out, and it purges the transmit
queue. Then it usually works again for a bit.
I am using kernel 2.2.14 and pcmcia-cs 3.1.8 or 3.1.9 (cannot remember
for sure - will check, if needed).
If I can be of any help in debugging the problem, let me know. We've
got a bunch of these systems and it would be nice to have them working.
