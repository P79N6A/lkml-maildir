Just a clarification (for the next version ;): itŽs not really a
congestion notification. It is just a `receiver' busy condition.
LAPB is not designed for congestable links and cannot really report
that congestion occured. It can only delay acknowledgement (and
communicate rx_busy state to the peer). The retransmission was really
only designed for occasionally recovering from transmission error
caused by line noise. Once a packet has been lost, all packets (even
those already arrived after the lost one) must be retransmitted. There is
nothing like selcetive acknolegment. Thus, although LAPB can recover from
packet loss caused by congestion, it will not react in a manner adapted
to the congestion state. For minimizing possible confusion about the
different X.25 layers, IŽd suggest to eplicitly call it `LAPB
datalink layer of X.25Ž in future versions of the document.

Nice. I think such a kind of fair input queueing would be an important
features because that allows to offer a highly reliable netif() to
slow links which are slow, but inefficient to handle congestion
(like X.25 LAPB datalink protocol). Network interfaces could trade
reliablilty for speed.
Another issue: Some protocols designed for congestable links support
forward and/or backward congestion notification (e.g. frame relay, I thing
DECnet and IPV6 also can do so). Thus, it would be nice if those protocols
could easily access the congestion state such that congestion notification
bits can be set efficiently.

Seems there are lots of interesting problems to investigate and
to solve. Anyhow, no matter how the details will be in future,
WhatŽs basically needed is a return value for netif_rx(). This is also
`nice` for symmetry reasons (in 2.4.x, dev_queue_xmit() returns an
int, too).
Would it possibe to make the return sematics of the varios
layer-boundary-crossing methods conssitent ore are they just to
different? There is currently no agreement among the different
protocol implementations. Many of them use a boolean return value for
reporting whether delivering to upper/lower layer was sucessful.
But there is unfortunatly no unique convention whether 1 means success
or failure.
IŽll be leaving for Linux-Kongress. Thus, I wonŽt be able to
further contribute to this thread for this week.
Cheers,
Henner
