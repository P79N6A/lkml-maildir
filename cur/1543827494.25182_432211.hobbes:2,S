I'll take positive config options over negative ones any day.  I find it
easier to read things that say what they *are* rather than what they are
*not*.
In any case, STATIC is really there as an override for architectures to
say, "I know what I am doing, I use gcc 3.4 and above, or, I don't want
to use bootmem".  Extreme is really there to say, "I want two-level
lookups because my memory is extremely sparse."
Make sense?
