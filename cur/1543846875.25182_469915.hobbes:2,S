I wasn't clear about the structure. I meant a ring-buffer with 3 areas. So 
it's basically the same model as Eric Dumazet described, only with 3 indexes; 
2 in the user-writeable page and 1 in kernel.
When the kernel has alloced an entry it should store it in a way that makes it 
invalid after user consumsion, which is simply an increment of an index. 
Sliding-window like schemes should solve this.
