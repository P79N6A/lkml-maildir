This all looks very good, nice job.  I only had one minor comment on the
patches, which I'll reply to directly.
But I did have a few questions:
	- This series relys on Mathew's rewrite of the acpiphp driver.
	  Is that acceptable?  Is that patch necessary for your work?
	  And if so, can you include it in the whole series?
	- Does this break the i386 acpiphp functionality?
	- Have you tested other pci hotplug systems with this patch
	  series?  Like pci express hotplug, standard pci hotplug,
	  cardbus, etc?
	- Are you wanting the acpi specific patches to go into the tree
	  through the acpi developers?  How about the ia64 specific
	  patches?
	- Have the acpi developers agreed with your acpi patches?
thanks,
greg k-h
