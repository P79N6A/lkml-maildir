Hi,

For the prism card, they should use hostap driver, but there no way to
check that (we can't log in on it). At least [2] list hostap in their
drivers.

According to [1] it is downloaded from the company server. But as we
can't log in the freebox, there no way to check it. Also sniffing adsl
is a bit harder...

If you look at [2], their drivers are in the kernel tree. Don't they fall
to GPL ?
