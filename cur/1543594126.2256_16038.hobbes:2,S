Actually, it already does the lazy write earlier.
The page reclaim code scans up to 1/4th of the inactive_dirty
pages on the first loop, where it does NOT write things to
disk.
On the second loop, we start asynchronous writeout of data
to disk and and scan up to 1/2 of the inactive_dirty pages,
trying to find clean pages to free.
Only when there simply are no clean pages we resort to
synchronous IO and the system will wait for pages to be
cleaned.
After the initial burst, the system should stabilise,
starting the writeout of pages before we run low on
memory. How to handle the initial burst is something
I haven't figured out yet ... ;)

This is due to this smarter handling of the flushing of
dirty pages and due to a more subtle bug where the system
ended up doing synchronous IO on too many pages, whereas
now it only does synchronous IO on _1_ page per scan ;)
