Actually, the later isn't broken, something may well call into the
higher level USB drivers while resuming, but indeed, those shouldn't
send any URB down the stack when the bus is suspended, and the EHCI
driver should drop incoming URBs as well until fully resumed.
I think the lock here is only needed to protect the HCD state
transitions David, no ? All we need is make sure that we don't let
things get queued (or call into EHCI code path that will end up
touch the HW) while suspended.
