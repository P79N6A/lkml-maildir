Subject: [patch] fixed lock_super() deadlock (process in D state)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

With the help of David Mansfield I am been able to remotely debug the
process in D state problem of 2.2.2 (and previous).
The problem is that the same process does lock_super() two times.
This patch I developed some hours ago against 2.2.2 fix the deadlock
perfectly:

I don't know _why_ this patch is needed and if it's 100% safe. Right now I
am trying with David's help to understand where the kernel is recursively
calling lock_super().
I want also to point out that the new semaphores of 2.2.2 had nothing to
do with these deadlock (so be quiet and go ahead porting them to all archs ;).
