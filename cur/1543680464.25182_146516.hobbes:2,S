Hi. I just went to my 2.5 kernel source tree and i did
#time grep foo * -r
in both 2.4 & 2.5
doing this in 2.4 takes:
real    0m50.614s
user    0m1.150s
sys     0m2.560s
2.5.74-mm3 AS:
real    0m46.207s
user    0m1.156s
sys     0m3.161s
2.5.74-mm3 deadline:
real    0m57.418s
user    0m1.160s
sys     0m3.107s
I repeated the tests and they show very similar numbers. One time 2.4 was faster
than 2.5 with AS.
Hardware is p3 2x800 UDMA 100 7200 rpm 2 MB ide disk, filesystem ext3 (default
mount options). DMA was activated in both 2.4 and 2.5.
Should 2.5 be faster here, or it's the expected behaviour? I'd
have expected a bit more of AS, but perhaps AS it isn't good for
this benchmark?
