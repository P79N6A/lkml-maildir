Bzzzzt. See Greg Hennessy's post.

Bzzzzzt.
Linux is getting deployed in lots of small businesses running
mailservers/firewalls etc on old P90's and the likes. Not because
they're run by geeks, but because they're running on a low budget.

It fails on newer hardware too. The Vaio I quoted is less than a year old.
The CyrixIII BIOS is less than 6 months old.

Go down the DMI path, and get it right _sometimes_, or take a zero.
Getting it right sometimes is likely to do more harm than good.

Crap. I'm implying that there should be a learning curve to everything
no matter how small it may be. You're trying to remove the curve
altogether.

*shakes head*, ok I'm all done trying to argue this one.

And write a book perchance ? SCNR  8-)
