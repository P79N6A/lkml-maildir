I'm having a different problem (also with 2.4.0-test4). I get a message
when I boot up that says:
kernel: parport0: PC-style at 0x378, irq 7 [PCSPP]
kernel: lp: driver loaded but no devices found       
If I attempt to print, I get "cannot open '/dev/lp0' - 'Device not 
configured'". Anybody know how to fix this?
