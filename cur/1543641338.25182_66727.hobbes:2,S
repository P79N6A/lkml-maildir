it is a bit ugly right now, in asm-m68/ide.h we have to include io.h
and redefine some of the defs. Even more fun with some net drivers (eg 8390)
which on m68k can accessed over ISA bus, Zorro bus, or Zorro bus +
ISA bridge and maybe a few other methods. Byteswaps are the smallest
problem here, we have also to translate adresses and deal with sparsely
mapped io regions.
A decent solution should use a per device "busops" struct that would
define in/out and other access methods for the underlying bus.
