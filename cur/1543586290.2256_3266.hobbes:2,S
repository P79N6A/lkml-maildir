No less than three patches were posted to linux-kernel fixing my
drivers/net/Makefile screwup... after I posted my own patch.  I never
assume people read lkml at all before posting a problem report.
Oh well, at least they are posting problem reports at all!  :)

Documentation/SubmittingPatches?  #3, #6, and especially #9 probably
apply here, I'm guessing.
