Had to try it out of curiosity, five ssh logins at the time, 
but I hit Ctrl-S on the terminal running forkbomb, then other 
terminals responsive and I could recover, do 'killall forkbomb'.
Even 'top' segfaulted.  Machine didn't die though.  
slackware-current running 2.4.29-hf5
Just checked logs, messages: --> kernel: VFS: file-max limit 52427 reached
nothing in syslog or debug
Cheers,
Grant.
