Neat, thanks for posting the link.
IMO, it would be nice to send results to linux-kernel,
but with a few restrictions:
* just a small email, with only key bits of info.
  URLs would point to more detailed information.
* a constant URL, which describes what the heck the email is all about
  (such as your above URL)
* for now, only bother with "ia32 Default"
* never email more than once a day... even if the bot gets stuck in a
  spamming loop, you need to have something in place to throttle emails.
* only email when state changes:  i.e. PASS->FAIL or FAIL->PASS,
  never PASS->PASS or FAIL->FAIL. [debateable... some may disagree with
  me on this one]
Comments?

P.S. The column headers in your report are broken, for example "ia32
Default" goes to bad link
