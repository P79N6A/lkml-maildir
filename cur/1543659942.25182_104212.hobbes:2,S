Nope, I found the problem. The topo cleanups are broken - we end up 
taking all mem accesses, etc to node 0.
Use the second half of the patch (the splitup I already posted), 
and fix the obvious compile error. Works fine now ;-)
Matt, you know the topo stuff better than anyone. Can you take a look
at the cleanup Ingo did, and see if it's easily fixable?
M.
PS. Ingo - I love the restructuring of the scheduler bits. 
I think we need > 2 multipler though ... I set it to 10 for now.
