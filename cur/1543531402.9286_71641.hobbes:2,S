[Cc'd to linux-net - suggest any follow-ups go there?]
Our servers get a lot of hits from academic sites and I think I've seen one
or two over the last 12 months. You're right, it's probably not significant
for companies. For institutions like say, government departments, I'd expect
them to make the effort, however.

Eww! Is writing HTML that gracefully degrades so difficult? If your HTML
can't viewed on a 5 year old browser, what's going to happen when it's viewed
with, say, a screen reader?
