You can also fix that by a remote login, chvt, or by just not piping X
output into interactive programs. tail -f is a viable workaround -- and
all this is off-topic on linux-kernel, it's your own dumbness that makes
you do these things. Better run kdm, gdm or xdm or something and you're
not having this problem.
