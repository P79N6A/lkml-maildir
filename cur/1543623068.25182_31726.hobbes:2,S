Good to know, thanks.  My point still stands, though :)  See below...

Well, conclusions like that slow down packet processing on the chip,
quite often...

It does, but not directly.  The infrastructure for VLAN and changing MTU
share common elements, so both should be merged at the same time.
This is ESPECIALLY key with 3c59x, because we are turning on support for
large frames, not specifically VLAN.  That is obviously the same
operation as changing MTU to a larger, non-standard one, and so should
not be treated as something vlan-specific.
Thanks much for the patch, whoever the author(s) were though... it
provides the necessary reference information to modify 3c59x for these
things I describe, and also provide the framework for 
Early next week, I will likely make a bombing run through several
drivers, fixing up the large frame and MTU issues.  That should be
enough for software VLAN.
