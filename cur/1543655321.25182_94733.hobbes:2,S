Subject: [PATCH][2.5][Trivial] VIA Rhine Kconfig entry
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Fix and update VIA Rhine description at least for 2.5 (I'll do 2.4, too, if
there's interest). Removed "experimental" flag for Rhine MMIO while I was
at it. Just barely resisted the temptation to make VIA Rhine conflict with
IO-APIC -- that seems to emerge as a fatal combo.
Please apply.
