I'll be annoying and take you up on this again.
It is possible that my FADV_WRITE_SYNC will do an extra write of a page
if it has since become dirty again, however that would seem to be rare
for such a thing to happen (ie. because the app has asked for some previous
copy of data to be on disk).
I'm not saying it would never happen, your sub-page sized example is one
probably valid case - however in that case Andrew's wait-for-write doesn't
always do the right thing either.
But I will grant that start-writeout + wait-for-write must be at least as
expressive as write-and-wait.
*however*, it still isn't perfect and it still does things worse than my
proposal. For example, if the kernel itself actually decides to start writeout
before you call fadvise(FADV_START_WRITEOUT) then it is now going to block
and wait for the io to finish.
Anyway if we agree they are both much of a muchness, then I hope we can
go for FADV_WRITE_ASYNC, FADV_WRITE_SYNC because it is consistent with the
rest of the userspace API we expose.
