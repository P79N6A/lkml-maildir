Mind if i push this debate slightly forward? If we were to move the 
dispatch of pending interrupts elsewhere, where would that be? In 
particular, for a device which won't issue any more interrupts until it's 
previous interrupt is serviced. Perhaps injection at arbitrary points 
during runtime when interrupts are enabled?
