What about microkernels? They do tcp in userspace. So did winsock, iirc. As
long as a trusted process keeps data such as free ports, what's the problem?
Perhaps a process could even simply hand off proto:port handles and let a
library do the rest, but i know little about exokernels. (There's probably
some catches.)
