Is this a case of the "read_ahead" array is redundant and read ahead is
done at a different level (not using this array), or is it a case of
read ahead not being done at all?  If it is not being done at all, then
removing the unused array is the wrong thing to do - we should fix
read ahead, and start using the array.
Cheers, Andreas
