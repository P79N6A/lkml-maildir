One issue with that is how to notify drivers that they need to make this call.  
In may cases, DMA completion will be signalled by an interrupt, but if the 
DMA failed, that interrupt may never happen, which means the call to 
pci_unmap or the above function from the interrupt handler may never occur.
Some I/O errors are by nature asynchronous and unpredictable, so I think we 
need a separate thread and callback interface to deal with errors where the 
beginning of the transaction and the end of the transaction occur in 
different contexts, in addition to the PIO transaction interface already 
proposed.
