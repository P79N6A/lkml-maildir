Allowing for the playing of DRM protected content is accepted.  While
it is sad to see big business rule the day, it is still copyrighted
works we are talking about.  GPL v3 says that the use of DRM in or
around the GPLv3 software would be a direct violation and therfore
illegal under the GPL liscense.  Respecting the limits setup by the
DRM or ACS would be a proactive step in making linux more corporate
friendly.  Should the individuals producing, directing and starring in
movies and music be penalized for the abuses of the recording
industry.  Piracy does exist and supporting the real creative works of
others is important.
According to the Managed Copy Protection in upcoming HD-DVD and
Blu-Ray discs, if the channel between digital display devices is not
authenticated as direct to display, the resolution would be cut to
prevent electronic copies from being easily made.
I seruiosly doubt that anyone commited to the Open Source community
would condone piracy, just as I am sure that Protection schemes always
break down in the end.  It is sometimes irresponsible to circumvent
methods designed to protect peoples copyright.  The viral liscensing
in the GPL v 2 allows for the best integration with 3rd party
applications.
The GPLv3 would not allow any copyrighted materials under DRM to be
viewed, one could even argue that protected PDF files might constitute
DRM and not be allowed under the new GPL.  I think that subverting the
efforts of companies and artists to protect their works is
unnaceptable.  Public crap about hacking iTunes to get unprotected
files is detrimental to the Open Source Community.  It should be noted
that DRM is not inherently bad, implementations are currently pretty
crappy, but surely an open source DRM could be presented, and a step
to make that happen would be to keep the Kernel under GPLv2.
