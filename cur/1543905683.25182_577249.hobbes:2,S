the tty layer has relatively short BKL latencies, but reiser3 has long 
ones, so those got transposed over to the tty layer, making it all quite 
noticeable to the user.
BKL contention is not a big issue on the desktop _unless_ there's at 
least one workload that creates really long BKL latencies. That 
multiplexes it out to all the other BKL-using subsystems too.
the DRI/DRM BKL use was a problem some time ago, but i think it's now 
using unlocked_ioctl(), correct? All the other ioctls are rare enough to 
not really matter.
with PREEMPT_BKL there's also some sort of random effect of priority 
inversion that makes the actual latencies depend on the scheduler - but 
we dont understand that effect exactly, yet. (hopefully Kasper can help 
us out with that. Peter got rid of his reiser3 partition the moment the 
latencies were traced back to it.)

oh, wonderful! Alan, you are a true wizard :-) The tty layer is one of 
the very few pieces of kernel code that scares the hell out of me :-)
