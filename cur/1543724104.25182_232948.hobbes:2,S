Whee. Five seconds after writing the above and sending it off, what do I 
see on CNN but:
	Another 'Police Academy' in works
	New film would be eighth in series
	LOS ANGELES, California (Hollywood Reporter) -- "Police Academy"
	is back.  After a decade's absence from the big screen, the cop
	comedy franchise is gearing up for an eighth installment.
I rest my case.
