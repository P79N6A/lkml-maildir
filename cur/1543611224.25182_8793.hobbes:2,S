I've sent an email to the general linux man pages maintainer (Andries
Brouwer) at LDP regarding the state of the kernel manpages (section 8?).
Is there an interest in having the kernel functions/device drivers
documented? I'm thinking more in the style of Free/NetBSD. Obviously not
all API can be covered since some of it is for internal use only.
Comments?
