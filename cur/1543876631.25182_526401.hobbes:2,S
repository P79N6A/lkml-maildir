Why not?  We use it above for sparse_index_alloc() and if it is doing
something wrong, I'd love to fix it.  Can you elaborate?

Ok, then let's make it take pages of some kind or its argument.

Can you extend it to work on ppc? ;)
You haven't posted V2, right?

OK, that makes sense.  However, it would still be nice to hide that
#ifdef somewhere that people are a bit less likely to run into it.  It's
just one #ifdef, so if you can kill it, great.  Otherwise, they pile up
over time and _do_ cause real readability problems.
