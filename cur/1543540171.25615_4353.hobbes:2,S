and who is saying that current is the X server? current is insmod if the
function is called from init_module() and is mount(8) if the function is
called from read_super() and is process XYZ if the function is called in
the context of the process XYZ. Nobody said anything about X server. The
current is the process in whose context the print_string() is called and
which has a controlling terminal.
