hmm... yes...
RAMFS uses dcache_readdir which keeps a cursor in the list of entries
such that delete/insert doesn't change the effective location of the
cursor.
Doing that in NFS would require the server keeping an open file on
behalf of the client.  That wouldn't be too hard for NFSv4, except
that you would still need some way to deal with server reboots.
But then RAMFS wouldn't survive a server reboot anyway.

That is like the filesystem Bob Copeland described.
And if the chains are not sorted, then I think the only way you could
reliably implement getdents is to use a cursor, and that doesn't map
over NFS very well.
Even if the chains were sorted, they could conceivably be sorted by
position-in-file in which case my 'cookie or filename' would not be
enough.  You need 'cookie and filename'.
So my new position is that:
  A READDIR (aka getdents2) should take a directory handle, a cookie,
  and a filename, and should return filenames and cookies.  The
  cookies may all be identical or may not.  The filename might be used
  by the filesystem, or it might not.
  Filesystems that require a cursor in the 'struct file' to support
  (local) getdents cannot be used with NFS.
While it doesn't make it possible to support all conceivable
filesystems, it should make it easier for some filesystems to support
the demands of NFS.
Thanks,
