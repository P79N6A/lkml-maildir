I don't agree that that is true.
Do you have _any_ reasonable implementation taht would do that_

So we have memcpy() semantics for read()/write(), big deal. 
The same way you aren't supposed to use memcpy() for overlapping areas, 
you're not supposed to read/write into such areas, for all the same 
reasons.

No. That wouldn't work anyway, because the addresses are totally different 
kinds.

The way we do now, which is the CORRECT way.
Stop this idiocy. 
The current interface is quite well-defined, and has good semantics. Every 
single argument against it has been totally bogus, with no redeeming 
values.
