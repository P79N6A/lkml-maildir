 Unfortunately this needs not be the reason.  Another possibility is a
crappy driver -- if a device generates a level-triggered interrupt which
does not deassert immediately after getting acked (perhaps because the IRQ
line is firmware-driven) and the handler in the driver doesn't ack it soon
enough, it's possible for the interrupt line to be still asserted after
exiting the handler.  The processor may have enough time to accept the
interrupt again and with the right timing, the line may go inactive right
in a middle of the processor's interrupt acknowledge sequence.  The 8259A
PIC will signal a spurious interrupt in this case.
