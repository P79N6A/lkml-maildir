I doubt that, the BK->patch "gateway" is a necessary part of
kernel development.  Without it, bitkeeper would stop being
useful.
I could be wrong, but I'm under the impression that Larry
doesn't want others to just copy bitkeeper to come up with a
free tool almost as good as bitkeeper.  There is no vendor
lock-in or anything else going on, afaics.
People who want to make something better than bitkeeper can
simply rsync the BK/SCCS repository from nl.linux.org and
use some SCCS clone to import the kernel data and commit
comments into their own repository ... they just can't use
bitkeeper to help them with their work.
regards,
Rik
