   The data is all in a shared file system, nice and coherent, the
   apps don't actually know there is another OS banging on the data,
   it all just works.
Larry1: "One way to get the ccCluster scalability is by un-globalizing
         the filesystem"
Larry2: "Let me tell you about this great application of ccClusters,
	 it involves using a shared file system.  It all just works."
Either you're going to replicate everyone's content or you're going to
use a shared filesystem.  In one case you'll go fast but have the same
locking problems as a traditional SMP, in the other case you'll go
slow because you'll be replicating all the time.
Which is it :-)
What I suppose is coming up is some example application that really
doesn't need a shared filesystem, which I bet will be a quite obscure
one or at least obscure enough that it can't justify ccCluster all on
it's own.
