So? And what does it more? They are equivalent, just that skb_queue_len is faster
(does not jump). But remember that 2.2 is critical bug fixes only, a unnecessary
jump is not a critical bug (actually once egcs will use CMOV again there will be
no jump anymore on x86, but skb_queue_len will be still faster)

The basic idea behind header prediction is that you only turn it on if everything
is normal. If anything unnormal happens you turn header prediction off (pred_flags = 0)
and let it handle in the slow path. So for me it definitely does not look like the
right place for such a check. 
Other than that I think doing these costly hack just to cope with too small receive
buffers is a bad idea. Just make sure the receive buffer is big enough
<tongue in cheek>
if the user makes it too small it is his fault ("It hurts when I do that. Then don't do that.")
Also as Alexey noted a way to make the TCP stack drop all new incoming packets is sometimes
useful.</>
ok, I know that 2.2 is not the right place for such experiments, best fix to me looks like to
always force a reasonable minimum buffer size.

I do not consider it a problem that needs fixing in 2.2. For common setups
(Ethernet, FDDI, ...) a minimum value of 4096 or 8192 should work reasonably,
for extreme setups with big MTUs (HIPPI, IP over ATM) this could be tuned - perhaps
by a sysctl.
