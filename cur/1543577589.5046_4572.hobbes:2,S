My best reasons are...
Development: You don't have to recompile the kernel a billion times
while working on a driver, you just recompile the module.  Also, you
can debug, unload, fix, recompile, reload a module to add or fix
pieces of it all (hopefully) without rebooting.
Practical usage: When I take my laptop on the road I use ppp, so I
load it then.  Most of the time I don't need it, so I don't load it.
