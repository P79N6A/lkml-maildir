Yeah, it's really great when it's possible to get debug info out of
people e.g. they're willing to boot into a kernel instrumented with
the appropriate printk's/etc. Most of the time it's all guesswork.
People who post to lkml are much better about all this on average.
I never truly understood the point of kprobes/jprobes/dprobes (or
whatever the probing letter is), crash dumps, and so on until I ran
into this, not that I use personally them (though I may yet start).
Most of the time I just read the code instead and smoke out what
could be going on by something like the process of devising
counterexamples. For instance, I told that colouroff patch guy about
the possibility of getting the wrong page for the start of the buffer
from virt_to_page() on a cache colored buffer pointer (clearly
cache->gfporder >= 4 in such a case). Deriving the head page without
__GFP_COMP might be considered to be ugly-looking, though.
