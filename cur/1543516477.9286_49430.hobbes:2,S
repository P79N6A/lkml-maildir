I have looked in the Linux devicedrivers book, done searches
in news groups using dejanews, and read the Kernel hackers guide
among others, and can not find a definite answer to this question.
Others have asked the same question, but I have never seen the answers.
I need to read  and write regular files from with in a kernel module.
Is this possible?
I suspect it isn't, but just want conformation.
thanks.
