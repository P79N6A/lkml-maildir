Great Peter,
Is it planned to be included in the kernel at some point ?
For me it is the most important not to get things working on some
particular test systems, but to allow customers, which run generic or
vendor provided kernels to use the functionality.
Does your patch only computes statistics on per process basics or per
thread as well ?
