Subject: 1gb RAM + 1gb SWAP + make -j bzImage = OOM

On 2.4.17, I can't make -j bzImage without OOM kicking in.  Relatively
light .config here - bzImage compiles to less than 1mb.
Seems with 1 gb of RAM and swap, the box should be able to handle this
(box is dual P3 600 btw).  
Is this unreasonable?  How much RAM should it take to accomplish this???
