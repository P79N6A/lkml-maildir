fair enough (the new initrd API allows that, but it's very ugly that it
is not dynamic from a kernel param like rootfstype would be, but it
instead has to be written on disk within the initrd), however as said
that's all due the brokeness of the rootfs params, they should apply
only to the fianl real root dev, never to the initrd.
