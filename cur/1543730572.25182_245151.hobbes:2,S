I knew he was using a debian kernel from the moment I saw
the string "tg3_request_firmware()" in the very first email
of this thread.
I pity the poor fool who wishes to netboot his system using
a tg3 card and use an nfsroot with Debian.  Kind of hard to
get the card firmware from the filesystem in that case.
I guess these debian kernel folks replace the BIOS on their
system with one they have the sources for as well.
The tg3 firmware is just a bunch of MIPS instructions.
I guess if I ran objdump --disassemble on the image and
used the output of that in the tg3 driver and "compiled
that source" they'd be happy.  And this makes the situation
even more ludicrious.
