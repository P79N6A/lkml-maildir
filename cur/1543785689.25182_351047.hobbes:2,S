Greetings All.
Is there anything you think I should know about setrlimit that is not
mentioned in setrlimit(2) manual that makes the malloc(3) succeed 
in the code below? It fails when r.rlim_cur is less than 137840.
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <sys/resource.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main(int ac, char* av[]) {
        struct rlimit r;
        r.rlim_cur = 137840;
        r.rlim_max = RLIM_INFINITY;
        setrlimit(RLIMIT_DATA, &r);
        char* a=malloc(6000000);
        perror("malloc");
        return 0;
}
What is more interesting is that dnscache from djbdnspackage succeeds to start
up with rlim_cur to be 0.
