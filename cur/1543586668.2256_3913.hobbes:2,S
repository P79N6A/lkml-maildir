indeed. The current scheduler handles UP and SMP systems, up to 32
(perhaps 64) CPUs efficiently. Agressively NUMA systems need a different
approach anyway in many other subsystems too, Kanoj is doing some
scheduler work in that area.
but the original claim was that the scheduling of thousands of runnable
processes (which is not equal to having thousands of sleeping processes)
must perform well - which is a completely different issue.
