Hi.
I have an ASUS A7N8X Deluxe board and had those annoying hangups when 
the system had high disk activity.
I tried to reduce the UDMA level or even remove the amd74xx driver from 
my kernel and run the system with PIO, but the system still crashed from 
time to time.
Last weekend I disabled the use of the APIC (the system now uses XT-PIC) 
and this seems to fix the problem. The system ran stable with UDMA100 
enabled for the last 4 days.
HTH,
Jens
