yeah. I'll investigate - it's quite likely that sk_receive_queue.lock 
will have to get per-address family locking rules - right?
Maybe it's enough to introduce a separate key for AF_UNIX alone (and 
still having all other protocols share the locking rules for 
sk_receive_queue.lock) , by reinitializing its spinlock after 
sock_init_data()?
