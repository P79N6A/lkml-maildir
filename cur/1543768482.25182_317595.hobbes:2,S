This patch causes the ppc64 G5 to lock up fairly early in boot.  It's
pretty much a default config:
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/config-pmac
No serial port, no debug environment, but no useful-looking error messages
either.  See 
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/dsc02516.jpg
Also, the patch came through with all the "^ $" lines converted to
completely empty lines - probably your email client is trying to be clever.
Please send yourself a patch, check that it applies?
Finally, I do intend to merge up the various slab patches which are in -mm,
so if you could base further work on top of those it would simplify life,
thanks.
