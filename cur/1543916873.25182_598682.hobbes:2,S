Subject: [PATCH 3/3] Fix other possible sources of latency issues
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/25/266

There is a possibility that because of task of a group moving from one
cpu to another, it may gain more cpu time that desired. See 
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=119073197730334
 for details.
This is an attempt to fix that problem. Basically it simulates dequeue
of higher level entities as if they are going to sleep. Similarly it
simulate wakeup of higher level entities as if they are waking up from
sleep.
