Huh?
(1) Feel free to write whatever hacks you want for the kernel.  Anyone can do that.
(1a) Convincing others that what you've done is worthwhile is more about
their freedoms than yours, however.
(2) The OpenGL API is not proprietary.  The label is.  [Mesa, for example, hasn't
yet been certified as an official implementation of OpenGL, but it uses the API.]
What I meant was: have I missed some important technical concept?
