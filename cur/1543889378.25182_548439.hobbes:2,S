Considering that the chipsets still have support for features that 
*really* aren't used (and haven't been used in over a decade), I doubt the 
conf1 thing is going away any time soon.
Things like: A20 gate, 15-16MB holes, i387 FP exception on irq 13 are 
totally pointless in this day and age. Things like the DMA controller are 
getting there, along with PS/2 keyboard support.
So there's a lot of things that are likely to be removed before conf1 
accesses would. Removing CONF1 accesses would break every single current 
OS, they'll do that ten years from now at the earliest.
