If it's IOAPIC related IRQ routing, then yes.  If it's a PCI quirk on that
motherboard that we aren't working around then no.  Both of these are IRQ
routing bits of code BTW, which is why I didn't answer your question as
yes/no.  The IOAPIC code will rewrite the PCI IRQ entries based upon an SMP MP
table, and absent that the PCI code attempts to verify the IRQ routing of the
cards as well (although I don't think it actually modifies anything).  In the
absence of an MP table and SMP, the likely culprit is a bad entry in the PCI
config space from the BIOS.  It's possible then that going into the MB BIOS
and triggering the reset configuration space stuff *might* make a difference
on how IRQs are assigned by the BIOS and what gets placed into the PCI config
space of the card by the BIOS and might make linux work.
Windows probably works on this machine because it has a special case handler
for whatever is going on (or else we have a genuine PCI bug here that we need
to fix and it's only triggered on certain rare MBs like this one).
