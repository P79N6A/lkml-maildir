What's wrong with the stuff I did in mdps? a misc character device that 
acts like /dev/rtc. Why does it have to be input device oriented?

I also looked at what you did in the patches as well as the modified 
hdapsd. I'm doing the raw input device right now in the mdps, but I have 
a suggestion.
It seems to me that right now there are at least 3 drivers that provide 
the same functionality - hdaps, ams and mdps. Why not create the input 
device
that exports raw accelerometer data with a name that is generic - 
something like accel/input or something along those lines. This way 
hdapsd could work
with any driver that provides the functionality without being hdaps 
specific.
