Ahem.  No.  There are dozens of incremental code releases all publicly available on
the maintainer's site.

His 'buggy' code resulted in -more- operational cards than the convoluted v86 that
stayed in the kernel for an unbearable time.  I got so tired of copying Donald's
tulip.c into the tree everytime I put a new kernel up that I made a script.  Even
after much deliberation on l-k.  The l-k copy of tulip.c was never updated from
Donald's site because "the patch was too big" until there was such a gnashing of
teeth that Alan allowed it.
A great many of us had to use the 'buggy' version from Donald because his worked,
the kernel version didn't.

Tulip development is such a huge issue that it has it's own list and discussion of
the drivers is encouraged there.  Same goes for cards like the eepro.  There has
been a -lot- of public discussion regarding a -lot- of the changes.

And the open source world has more than one place for work to get done.  Note the
USB crew does the majority of their work -and- discussion elsewhere.  Combining the
traffic for all the lists of all the developers onto l-k would make keeping up with
l-k very unbearable.

What's the point of a compatibility layer when Linus said get rid of 2.2 support?

We've gone over this again and again.  We simply aren't going to culminate all the
development efforts onto one list and one source tree.  Right now we have dozens of
different trees for the linux kernel.  CVS, Alan's, Ingo's...etc.  It makes more
sense when you're trying to eliminate bugs to constrain change to a well known set.
It's all nice and fine that you're trying to make a good thing with the tulip
driver.  But alienating the guy who probably knows the most about the chipsets by
far isn't a good thing for you or us.  I appreciate your effort and I don't fault
your effort.  I do dislike the attitude wrt Donald and that's the extent of my
angst.  Unfortunately, all tulip stuff I have fails all over the place with the
listed faults.  I can't now use the tulip code in the kernel, nor can I easily
patch Donald's code in due to the variance.  I'm forced to pull all my tulips out
and put other cards in.
