Well... you can keep the whitelist where you prefer it -- it may make
sense for support of desktops...

Unfortunately, your decision means few things:
1) we can't debug it easily: I can no longer tell Andrew to boot into
init=/bin/bash , and run s2ram. For debugging, trying with minimal
system is very important.
2) you use bunch of shellscripts. If your SATA does not wake up, you
get no video, and probably no chance to pull debug info out of that
box. s2ram is pagelocked for that reason.
...plus, you could easily keep your whitelist in HAL and just call
s2ram, unless user is running it manually.
