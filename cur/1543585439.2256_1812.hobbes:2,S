You'll have fun with your root shell, then  ;)
The current OOM code takes things like uptime, used cpu, size
and a bunch of other things into account.
If it turns out that the code is not attaching a proper weight
to some of these factors, you should be sending patches, not
flames.
(the code is full of comments, so it should be easy enough to
find your way around the code and tweak it until it does the
right thing in a number of test cases)
regards,
Rik
