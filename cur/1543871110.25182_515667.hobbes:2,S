Thanks for adding me to the thread.

I don' t know yet.  I was notified of the problem through bugzilla:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8128
The problem appears that a non-uptodate page has been marked dirty.  I
haven't found much in the way of changes between 2.6.20 and the current
git tree to explain this.  There's this one:
http://git.kernel.org/gitweb.cgi?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=22c8ca78f20724676b6006232bf06cc3e9299539
I'm looking for for a caller to ->prepare_write() which marks the page
dirty without calling ->commit_write().
Will, could you try reverting that patch?  If that fails, narrowing the
problem down with git-bisect would be helpful, if you have the time.
Thanks,
Shaggy
