Hmm, nice to know that. When I do bigmm test, I see it kswapd call to
writepage. You are telling me at that point, bigmm is dead already?
I did not know enough about the vm system. If program did not map
this memory any more. It is ok to drop then. VMware do not care about
what is left on the ram file at all.
Thanks for you long explain.
