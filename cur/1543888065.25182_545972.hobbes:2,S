We are just reading IOAPIC RTE's. So not sure why this can lead to lock
up's. This patch is not reading any new HW registers. It just
checks for certain bit values from the register that the code reads
anyhow.
Remote IRR should work reliably otherwise we will see lot more issues,
I guess.

Under some stress conditions, EOI can get retried because of which
it is getting delayed.

yes.

Wanted to minimize the code duplicacy and hence overloaded existing
macros.

Just wanted to make sure that we give some time for the EOI to actually
reach the IO-APIC.

Because the EOI to IOAPIC gets generated as a side effect of processor
EOI.
