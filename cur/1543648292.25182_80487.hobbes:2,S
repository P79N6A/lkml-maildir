 looking at that i realise that DAC960 code in 2.5.43
is not supposed to be tested:
======
#error I am a non-portable driver, please convert me to use the Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt interfaces
======
 am i right?
the following weirdo appears in both gcc-3.1 and 3.2 (also in 2.5.42)
======
drivers/block/DAC960.c: In function `DAC960_DetectControllers':
drivers/block/DAC960.c:2465: `Controller' undeclared (first use in this function)
drivers/block/DAC960.c:2465: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
drivers/block/DAC960.c:2465: for each function it appears in.)

cheers,
