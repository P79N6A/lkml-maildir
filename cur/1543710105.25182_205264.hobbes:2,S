Randy,
I did try 'modprobe dummy numdummies=3' and I didn't work. I got an 
error and the following showed up in /var/log/messages...
Mar  9 14:42:33 l43w2k021 modprobe: FATAL: Error inserting dummy 
(/lib/modules/2.6.3/kernel/drivers/net/dummy.ko): Unknown symbol in 
module, or unknown parameter (see dmesg)
Now it works and I get no error message. I tried numdummies= on another 
similarly configured machine and it worked first time. So maybe the 
error message above was caused by a typo when I tried it the first time
Anyway, numdummies= does work as you said.
Thanks,
Rick Knight
