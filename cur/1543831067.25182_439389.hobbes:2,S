It's still more than there was before. Also __get_cpu_var 
is quite a lot of instructions.
I would suggest you borrow some bits in one of the process
or thread info flags and then do a single test
if (unlikely(thr->flags & (DEBUG|PERFMON)) != 0) { 
        if (flags & DEBUG)
                ... do debug ...
        if (flags & PERFMON)
                ... do perfmon ...
}
[which you're at it you can probably add ioports in there too -
improving existing code is always a good thing]
Ideally flags is in some cache line that is already 
touched during context switch. If not you might need
to change the layout.
It's ok to put the do_perfmon stuff into a separate noinline
function because that will disturb the register allocation
in the caller less.
I would suggest doing this in separate preparing patches that
first just do it for existing facilities.

P.S.: My comments probably apply to the i386 versions too
although I haven't read them.
