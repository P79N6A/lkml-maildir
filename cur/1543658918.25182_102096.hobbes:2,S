hmm...i don't see why i want wchan. tell me.
but you're right, for some reason linus merged it. so i think (if it's
kept) we should restrict it a bit and make the kallsyms_lookup a bit
faster. not a super fast complex algorithm, but at least not that
braindead as it currently is...
btw. does my ugly early-in-the-moring-hack work right?
