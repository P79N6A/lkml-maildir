It looks as if there's a very suitable fix in kernel/ptrace.c .
In access_one_page we have 
	if (write) {
		maddr = kmap(page);
		memcpy(maddr + (addr & ~PAGE_MASK), buf, len);
		flush_page_to_ram(page);
		flush_icache_page(vma, page);
		kunmap(page);
	}
which looks ideal to me...
That still leaves 2.2 broken, though :-(
