I have a question on sys_readahead and would appreciate 
some hint or a pointer.
- When was this call added?
- As far as i understand the code it reads the data into 
  the page cache. The data is ready sync and there is no
  way to do this async and have a notification unless using
  a separate thread.
A typical use i could see is preloading some data in the
page cache from a separate thread (eg. for a media player).
BTW: AFAICS the code is off by one if offset/count is not in 
PAGE_SIZE chunks? 
  unsigned long start = offset >> PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT;
  unsigned long len = (count + ((long)offset & ~PAGE_CACHE_MASK)) >> PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT;
Thanks
Michael
