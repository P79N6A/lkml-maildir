How exactly does such a solution work with hot-plugable devices?
Some daemon that gets informed of devices appearing and disappearing?
I don't think I'm being unreasonable in thinking that when a device 
is added to the system it should instantly be usable.  That's kind of
the point of dynamic busses, no?
