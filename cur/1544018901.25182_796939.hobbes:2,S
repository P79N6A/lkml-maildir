I am thoroughly surprised by this email exchange.
From where I sit, there is almost no such thing as posting patches too
early. Really. Transparency and early review/feedaback is by far
more important than ignoring a few more patches in an area you
don't careabout.
Your second paragraph makes me wonder if your email is more political
than technical in nature. But either way, you should feel encouraged
to release early, release often.
