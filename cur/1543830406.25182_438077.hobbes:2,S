proper spinlocks ;)
cli/sti assumed to disable interrupts on all processors, and so when an
old driver uses cli/sti it's sort of a lock against any interrupt
handler (yes this is locking code not data!). In general you need to
find out what data the author wanted to protect, and just create proper
locking for that data.  
yes this is not a mechanical transformation.. if it was it would have
been done already :)
