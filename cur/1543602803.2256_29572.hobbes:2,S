This will break your for loop immedeately, because the loop criteria
is already violated by the initialization !
But I tried another solution:
  for (gp = gendisk_head; gp && (gp->next != gendisk_head); gp = gp->next) {
with no success - the cat /proc/partition only printed the heading line.
This proofed to me, that the pointered list is created the wrong way,
in other words, gendisk_head->next is a pointer to itself.
It looks to me, that the "next" field in 
/*static*/ struct gendisk *gendisk_head;
is not initialized (by the compiler ?) correctly to NULL.
