Hi,
I am passing a packet consisting of a fixed length header and a
variable length data block to a user mode application. The user mode
application passes the pointer of its buffer with an ioctl call
(buff_ptr). When the driver receives buff_ptr, it makes two calls to
pass the packet to user mode:
copy_to_user(buff_ptr, header, header_size);
copy_to_user(buff_ptr + header_size, data, data_size);
Is this a valid usage? Or can I only use buff_ptr here?
