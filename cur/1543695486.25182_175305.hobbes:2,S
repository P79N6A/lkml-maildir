The logs look like a SCSI timeout - a 30 second gap, followed by abort,
test unit ready, and a resend of the timed out write. That does not help
much. It could certainly be a lost interrupt.
I did not see any timeout/aborts happening (immediately) after the acpi
messages.

I don't know ACPI, but I thought interrupt problems it might cause
happened more consistently.
