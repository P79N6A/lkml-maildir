Arg... I already downloaded this and made the module from it as i did
not want to compile the pre8 kernel yet.  (I only had to run the i8kmon
using 'wish i8kmon' as it complained about 'Tk'; this is latest Rawhide)

Great, Just add "--mute "aumix -v 0" to mute, but I do prefer the gmix
way that restores original volume level when the mutebutton is pressed
again but that probaly only works as gmix is running all the time...
