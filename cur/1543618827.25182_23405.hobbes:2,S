Is there any hope, that this gets (re-)changed again in the 2.4
tree sooner or later?
I'm still using 2.4.13 because of this :)
I tried everything up to 2.4.17 but it was ever the same since 2.4.14 :)
Maybe one could make it a configure-able 'feature'?
I would happily pre-check a suggested patch, if this would help :)

Well, I've checked the /proc/acpi/gpe for serval different BIOS
settings - it contains ever the same:
GPE0: 0f 00
regardless if I enable or disable Kbd-Pwr-ON or WOL in BIOS.

Well, add me, but I know, it does stop working between .13 and .14 :)
