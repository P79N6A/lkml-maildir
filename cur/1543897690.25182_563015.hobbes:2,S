Hello,
thanks ;), you might help me to decide if somebody abuses a list already
for free advertising or is still contributing.

Sorry, my question is, where one can look up if the pinning of a newer
chip we support is also only under NDA available. Previously often at
least that was public. (examples now saa7131e, tda10046a, tda8275ac1)
If I don't find anything on the web, whom I have to ask that question,
the NDA holder, the manufacturer or do we have a list, because everybody
knows that this can be helpful to identify hardware differences and this
question is always asked already?
Thanks,
Hermann
