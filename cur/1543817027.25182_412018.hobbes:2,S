Ok, I'll call those three VPSes fast, faster and fastest.
"fast"    : fill rate 1, interval 3
"faster"  : fill rate 2, interval 3
"fastest" : fill rate 3, interval 3
That all adds up to a fill rate of 6 with an interval of 3, but that is
right because with two processors you have 2 tokens to allocate per
jiffie.  Also set the bucket size to something of the order of HZ.
You can watch the processes within each vserver's priority jump up and
down with `vtop' during testing.  Also you should be able to watch the
vserver's bucket fill and empty in /proc/virtual/XXX/sched (IIRC)

I mentioned this earlier, but for the sake of the archives I'll repeat -
if you are running with any of the buckets on empty, the scheduler is
imbalanced and therefore not going to provide the exact distribution you
asked for.
However with a single busy loop in each vserver I'd expect the above to
yield roughly 100% for fastest, 66% for faster and 33% for fast, within
5 seconds or so of starting those processes (assuming you set a bucket
size of HZ).
Sam.
