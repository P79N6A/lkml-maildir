Huh?  explain...  If I have multiple programs running and one cores, 
would I not want to have the core file name be based on the program that
cored?  Linux had the PID option (kernel.core_uses_pid) specifically so
that you could have multiple process core files.
Plus, I need to be able to redirect core files to a sane location in the
cluster (which is a whole other kettle of fish).
