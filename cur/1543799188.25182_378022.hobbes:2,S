Took a quick break from repeatedly shooting myself in the foot with
RCU read-side priority boosting (still have a few toes left) to take
a quick look at this.  The TASK_TRACED and TASK_STOPPED cases seem
non-trivial, and I am concerned about races with exit.
Any thoughts on whether the latency is due to contention on the
tasklist lock vs. the "goto repeat" in do_wait()?
						Thanx, Paul
