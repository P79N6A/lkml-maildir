# [PNP] PnPBIOS resource setting fix
# 
# If a device is disabled when initially read, its blank resource data will not
# be cleared and the pnp layer will assume incorrectly that the device has
# already been configured.  This patch resolves the issue by initializing the
# resource table if the device is found to be disabled.
