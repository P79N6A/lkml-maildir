After playing w/ these tunables it occurred to me that they are really only 
deadline limits, w/ a direct relation to cpu/mem/ctxt perf.
i.e timeslice=1 on i386sx means something other than timeslice=1 on amd64
It follows that w/o autotuning, the static default values have to be selected 
to allow for a large underlying perf range w/ a preference for the high 
range.  This is also the reason why 2.6 feels really crummy on low perf 
ranges.
Autotuning the default values would allow to tighten this range specific to 
the hw used, thus allowing for a smoother desktop experience.
Thanks!
