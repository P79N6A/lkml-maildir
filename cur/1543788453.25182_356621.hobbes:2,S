Andi, Those headers are for phys_pkg_id(). And its meaning is same on both 
x86 and x86_64(though its API is different. We can make it consistent across 
x86 and x86_64. But that will not solve the above pointed out ifdef hunk)
Unfortunately x86 mach specific vector implementation is not as simple as 
x86_64, resulting in the above ifdefs mess...
I can fix the API mess. Is there anything else you want me to do?
thanks,
suresh
