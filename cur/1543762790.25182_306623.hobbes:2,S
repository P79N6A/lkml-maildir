Because we are putting the starting address, end address and 
the memory type against each entry (just like in 
/proc/iomem). Of course, we can figure out the ending 
address knowing the starting address and the section size.

In addition to this, I also needed to pull-in the 
J-zone_resize_sem.patch to get it to compile.
Would it be possible to make this a separate patch-set so 
that it does not depend on memory hotplug.

I tested this on my PIII 256M machine. 
/sys/devices/system/memory showed 4 memory sections each of 
size 64MB. There are a couple of issues that we noticed. We 
will not be able to spot those physical memory areas which 
the OS does not use (such as the region between 640k and 
1MB). Also, when I booted the system with the mem=100M 
option, two entries (memory0 and memory1) turned up. With 
block_size_bytes being 64M, this turns out equivalent to a 
system with 128M memory.
If block_size_bytes was per-directory, it would be easier in 
such situations.
