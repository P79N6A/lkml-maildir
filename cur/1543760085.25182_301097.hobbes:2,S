that's bad. since all those details might help us to avoid problems and
save time in the future daemon design. I will really appreciate you will
point me to other potential problems once you recall.

over time it will be linked against klibc as dm-multipath do. It will
also help to implement iSCSI boot, when control plane daemon will be
part of initramfs image.

sure. the idea was to always keep second reserved/redundant TCP
connection per session opened. (please note, TCP connection, not iSCSI
connection). This way during recovery cycle in case of sane target,
initiator will switch into redundant TCP connection and send Login
request over. This could be implemented as a feature and might be
disabled via configuration utility if needed.
