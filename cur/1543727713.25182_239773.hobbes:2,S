I compiled mouse support statically instead of a module and it worked. But I 
will try this also.
However, I still have problems, especially with the mouse. I used my computer 
for a while and suddenly the mouse got wild so to say.
It jumped back and forth, starting applications, kinda funny to see actually.
I looked at dmesg, and it gave messages like:
Lost sync of mouse, throwing away 1 (and also 2 / 3) bytes.
I couldn't find the IRQ thread which is used by the mouse, but after disabling 
all of them it worked as normal, making IRQ threaded again made the mouse go 
north/south/west/east again.
I was only getting xruns, using 0.3 ms latency with my sound application when 
using the mouse, otherwise ALSA remained silent (not long tested due mouse 
problems)
Thanks,
Remon
