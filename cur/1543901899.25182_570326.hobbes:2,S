Again speaking only from the Indian context, we're somewhat unique when
compared to China and Japan ;-). It's extremely unlikely that a non-english
speaking user will become a developer. As I mentioned in my previous mail
technical education is almost completely in English. 
Most Indian IT work places communicate almost exclusively in English,
including verbal communication because of employees from all over India with
different native languages.  English is not a language barrier for
developers or even technical users from India.
