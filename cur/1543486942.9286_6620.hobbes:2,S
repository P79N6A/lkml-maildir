Well, I hate to say this but I think the new inode code IS causing
problems with applications.
Case in point: Bash with tab autocomplete.  It works on ext2 file
systems still but has stopped working on any form of msdos partitions
that I have (vfat and fat32).
I am afraid I cannot be more specific.  I believe this is caused by the
change to 'random' inode numbering for fat as it started showing up with
either 2.2.0 or 2.2.1
