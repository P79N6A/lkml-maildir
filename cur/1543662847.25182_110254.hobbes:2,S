If Linus pulls my BK tree, then Linus will also have the code.
If you also look at the backtraces I provided, you will also notice
that the functions concerned *are* the generic ones in kernel/signal.c
This /is/ using the generic get_signal_to_deliver() from kernel/signal.c
in Linus' released 2.5.61 kernel tree.
If you don't believe me, please try to reproduce it in an x86 2.5.61
box and report the results.
