NO! Doing such a test sets you up for a failure. If a vendor
of the card provides an on-chip TCP, it is entirely in the
vendor's interest to penalize regular TCP (for example, by
failing to provide checksum offload or sane S/G segments).
I only consider fair a test of on-chip TCP compared to
the best of the normal NICs.
