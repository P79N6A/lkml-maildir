Aside from the obvious, consider a server that needs to do a little bit of
work on each of 1,000 clients on a single CPU system. With a
thread-per-client approach, 1,000 context switches will be needed. With an
epoll thread pool approach, none are needed and five or six are typical.
Both get you the major advantages of threading. You can take full advantage
of multiple CPUs. You can write code that blocks occasionally without
bringing the whole server down. A page fault doesn't stall your whole
server.
