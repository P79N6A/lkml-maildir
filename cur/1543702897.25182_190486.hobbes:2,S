I didn't think these patches would make it into a kernel tree, except experimental ones.  For one, I don't think we know what's wrong with the nforce2's apic timer.  And second, I don't need the disconnect patch, because I have verfied a BIOS update has fixed C1 disconnect completely for my board. (works on and off)
If anyone needs stability, they should try the C1 disconnect off patch, use athcool, or set it off in the bios (whatever works).  As for me, I'd rather have it not default off because my board now works with it on and keeps my system cooler.
