Yes, but the question is whether anyone will do the hard part.  And
whether it is worth doing.  And whether you make the system unsafe along
the way, particularly given the permissive nature of capabilities.

Except that people actually want them to be inheritable (under certain
conditions), just in a way that avoids the problems encountered in the
past.  If you start on the path of making capabilities useful, you'll
have to tackle that as well.

Actually, ptrace already performs a capability comparison (cap_ptrace).
Wrt signals, it wasn't the communication channel that concerned me but
the ability to interfere with the operation of a process running in the
same uid but different capabilities, like stopping it at a critical
point.  Likewise with many other task hooks - you wouldn't want to be
able to depress the priority of a process running with greater
capabilities.
One other point to consider is Solaris seems to have diverged from their
own past approaches for privileges/capabilities,
http://blogs.sun.com/casper/20040722
http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/security/library/howto/privbracket/
Doesn't sound like they are even using file capabilities at all.
Also, think about the real benefits of capabilities, at least as defined
in Linux.  The coarse granularity and the lack of any per-object support
is a fairly significant deficiency there that is much better handled via
TE.  At least some of the Linux capabilities lend themselves to easy
privilege escalation to gaining other capabilities or effectively
bypassing them.
