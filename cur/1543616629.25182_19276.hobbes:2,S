As Chris already pointed out, there was a problem with old gcc 2.96.
Also such corruptions might be a fault of a disk, somebody carelessly writing data to reiserfsdisk and so on.
Right now it is way too easy to get reiserfs to panic by mounting specially crafted abd disk image, and this is
bad, I believe, so one of the tasks I am performing is to minimalize such cases. (look at ext2 as an example goal I want to achieve
some time in the future)
Bye,
