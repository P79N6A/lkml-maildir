You are correct.  However, as soon as you abort the problem command (assuming 
the device recovers from this), it will go on its merry way processing the 
remaining commands in the queue.  Assuming one of these is the barrier, you've 
no way now of re-queueing the aborted command so that it comes before the 
ordered tag barrier.  You can try using a head of queue tag, but it's still a 
nasty race.

I agree, but the most likely scenario is that now you're trying to abort 
almost every tag for that device in the system.  Isn't reset a simpler 
alternative to this?

I agree.  I certainly could do it.  I'm just a lazy so-and-so.  However, think 
what it does.  Apart from me having to do more work, the code becomes longer 
and the error recovery path more convoluted and difficult to follow.  The 
benefit?  well, error recovery might be faster in certain circumstances.  I 
just don't see that it's a cost effective change.  If you're hitting error 
recovery so often that whether it recovers in  half a second or several 
seconds makes a difference, I'd say there's something else wrong.
