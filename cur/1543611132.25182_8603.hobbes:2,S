Some people suggested I should get the Oops information from
/var/log/messages. I should have mentioned that the Oops turns up nowhere in
the logfiles. 
I did find a couple of (XFS-related?) Oopses that I hadn't noticed before
though. See the thread "XFS Oopses with 2.4.5 and 2.4.14?".  I am starting
to wonder whether it is a good idea to run XFS. Thanks.
