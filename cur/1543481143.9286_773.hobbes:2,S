I realy would like to know if both work individually.
The idea was to determine if changing the INITIAL_MULT_COUNT value to ONE
as a default option would fix the error without the need of the actual
patch.  Since I am looking beyond the current state of distrutions,
no one () will like to have to do double builds of bootdisks.
Much less the average JOE, newbie or enduser, will not want to have to
guess which to use.
I do not want this to look like a MicroSoft Win98 install that took
two-hours to press the enter key from rolling and laughing on the floor.
"Should your computer halt, please reset and continue with the install"
Mind you that anybody who did not roar aloud must not understand /dev/null.

I really need to know if this is resolve if we change the value of
INITIAL_MULT_COUNT with the option off works.

The UGLY zip fix would work, regardless of the strstr() error.
