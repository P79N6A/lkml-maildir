Hello everybody,
Since I have Linux on my system, I never succeeded to make my Wangdat work.
I hope I will find ppl who already had this kind of prb in the past and resolved
it.
few month ago, I installed the RH5.0 on my system and my wangdat 3100 was well
detected but I had I/O errors and there was no way to tar or have a status on
the drive. I spent so many time on the newsgroup that I dropped this issue for a
while.
Since this time, I upgraded my system to RH5.2 (kernel 2.0.36) and I also added
an  IDE TRAXDATA 2260 CD-R recognized as a SCSI device WORM instead of WANGDAT
I thought that was an issue with an ID conflict, so I changed the Wangdat ID as
well as the Plextor ID but nothing changed.
My system is a P166 MMX with an ASUS TX97-LE motherboard
Here is what I have on the SCSI chain:
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 04 Lun: 00
Vendor: WangDAT Model: Model 3100 Rev: 1.5a
Type: Sequential-Access ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 06 Lun: 00
Vendor: PLEXTOR Model: CD-ROM PX-6XCS Rev: 1.03
Type: CD-ROM ANSI SCSI revision: 02
This is what was detected under RH5.0
I can send logs if required
I really need your help on this one
Thanks in advance
