Yes.  dbench on 4-way was showing d_lookup hurting us, but replacing
dcache_lock with a rw_lock (Anton Blanchard provided an atomic_dec_and_wlock)
and a separate lock for the unused list DIDN'T HELP ONE BIT.
Why?  Because there's no contention on the lock!  The problem is almost
entirely moving the cacheline around (which is the same for a rw lock).
I'd love to say that I can solve this with RCU, but it's vastly non-trivial
and I haven't got code, so I'm not going to say that. 8)
