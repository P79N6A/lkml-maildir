I seem to be unfortunate enough to be the owner of a motherboard with an 
SiS 5591/5592 AGP chipset.  It seems to be a common-enough chipset that 
there would be a driver for it by now (checked 2.4.23-pre and 2.6.0-test7) 
-- bad vendor?
Am I SoL here?  Time to get another motherboard?  I'd be happy to lend my 
hardware to testing.
Thanks,
  John
