Yes, it is a sequence.  It it derived from real dependencies though,
where nondependent stuff have the same number.

Correct.

Now that is a really good idea.  Init could simply run "make -j init2" to
enter runlevel 2.  A suitable makefile would list all dependencies, and
of course the targets needed for "init2", "init3" and so on.
It might not be that much work either.  Parallel make exists already, 
and the
first attempt at a makefile could simply implement the current sequence that
is known to work. Then the tweaking comes. :-)
