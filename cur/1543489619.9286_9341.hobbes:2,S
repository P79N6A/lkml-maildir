No.

You probably did one or more from following:
 * forget to select IPX
 * compiled IPX as module without doing modules_install
 * you have `alias net-pf-4 off' in /etc/conf.modules
 * you compiled kernel with MODVERSIONS
 * you switched SMP on/off without doing
    mv .config ..config; make mrproper; mv ..config .config
You should look into your syslog or do `insmod ipx' manually and see, what
happens.
                                            Best regards,
                                                    Petr Vandrovec
