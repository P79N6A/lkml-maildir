Can't be, it wouldn't be all of anything-init if there are calls back into
it.

For hotplugs you'd just call (and load) foo-init again, if it's a module.
It can be a module even though foo-driver is part of the kernel, why not?
It's just that I don't see this as very relevant. My kernels weigh in at
something like 1Mb uncompressed, and unload just 36K of init stuff, i.e.,
some 3-4%. If you invest a few pages in the kernel to manage all this, you
loose overall.
