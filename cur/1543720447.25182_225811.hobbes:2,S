Okay, then its easy. Find offending driver; removing its
suspend/resume routine should work it around for you.
Solving this properly will be slightly harder; it involves finding
what the driver did wrong. You might want to call the driver's
suspend/resume routine repeatedly without really suspending to see if
it breaks something.
