nb. is their a way to get fair 'equal time / proc percentage per user' 
queueing of the CPU(s).
i.e. not limiting the number of processes/user but limiting the total CPU 
'power' in use by a given user, something like the CBQ network 
schedulers... perhaps with some classes (like root) more priveledged 
etc... or is this something for 2.7?
Cheers,
MaZe.
