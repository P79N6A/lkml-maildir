Hi,
The problem first appeared in 2.5.68-mm3 and is not in mainline 2.5.69.
It is present in all -mm releases since.
I have an IDE LG CDRW burner that has always worked fine both with
ide-scsi in 2.4 and without in 2.5. As can be seen in the inquiry out
put below the cdr device is not detected correctly by the -mm kernels.
It seems likely to be a kernel bug but I can't be certain.
Here is the inquiry output from cdrecord 2.0 from 2.5.69-mm3 which is
not working and 2.5.68-mm2 which is. I have straces of this too if that
would be useful. Same config was used for all kernels.
