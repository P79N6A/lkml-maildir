Hi!
I noticed that since the pm_* interface change, I think it was 2.3.43 (?),
the APM suspend function is not working anymore.
The effect I see is, APM enabled and no ACPI support, when I issue "apm -s"
the machine starts the suspend cycle but freezes solid after about two
seconds.
Any ideas or even fixes?
