The 'offset' argument is defined to be page aligned
when passed to mmap().

Yes, if the token goes in as the offset parameter to mmap() then
whatever ->mmap() code we write can call arch specific code to
transform it as necessary.

Let's make sys use 64-bit, yes.

It's been around for ages, and it used in the X server on PPC
and Sparc.  It mostly allows handling of multi-domain stuff.
Unfortunately, the $DOMAIN:xxx directory naming change we made
in 2.6.x for /proc/pci stuff broke the X server at least on
sparc64 :-/

I hate to say this, but the largest consumer of this stuff is the
X server, so we really need to force ourselves to work in parallel
on clean X server support.  Whether that's via some libpci.a
abstraction or whatever, I personally don't care, but without the
X support in some form all of this is API masterbation :-)

On many platforms some kind of "side effect" bit in the PTE
determine if store buffer compression can happen in the processor.
We'd want to not set such a bit for things like frame-buffers and
the like.
