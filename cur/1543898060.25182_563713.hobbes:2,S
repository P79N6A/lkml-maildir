Hork...
Identify the generic ioctls that are relevant to a FUSE file system and
have real meaning *and* are useful. Teach fuse to turn those to and from
messages properly and if you must add any others (ie if there is good
reason to want them then add a single FUSEFS ioctl something like
	struct fusefs_ioctl {
		u32 opcode;
		void *data_in;
		void *data_out;
		u16 size_in;
		u16 size_out;
	}
so that anything totally weird can be passed through without
horrible /proc/... hacks and without putting tons of cases into FUSE
