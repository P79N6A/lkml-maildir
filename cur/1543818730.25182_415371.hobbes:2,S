IANAL But I don't think that makes any difference at all.
The INTERACTION between syscalls and userspace is not a topic for
discussion really. Otherwise we'd have to put the boundary at
"syscalls that the Linux Gurus added" vs "syscalls someone else added
cause they thought they were neat".
NONE of the ones in the "neat" category are ever to be used ever by
ANY non-GPL program.
That is what it boils down to. I add a syscall to the kernel, you don't
like it? Tough, it's GPL so I can distribute it, etc etc.
A program emerges that uses that syscall? You don't like that ?
Equally tough. It doesn't matter if I wrote both parts or just one,
we're not looking at INTENT here. Either programs can be non-GPL
or they can't.
Btw, no I'm not jumping at anyone here, I am just trying to show
a point.
