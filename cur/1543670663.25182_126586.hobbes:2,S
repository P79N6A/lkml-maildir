I am kind of deluded, that's for sure. And sore too, but that's another one.
I tend to agree with you; however, it can be done. You would need to adapt
a circular buffer to work with kue. Not a big deal though - just an space 
allocator (that would recall the oldest messages if in need of space) and
the 
'destructor' would just clear the space.
If I get to modify the code to make the destructor thing work (any of these
days), then it will be possible to do it without modifying kue at all.
Now that I think about it, it would work - but I don't think it'd be
really worth it (the per-message overhead would be big for printk,
I'd say). For the record, I really think relayfs could be a better
answer [with the limited reading that so far I had about it].
