Well, there is nothing to do in this function, because that's what the
whole driver does: nothing. It just presents a range of IO ports to be
probed to the main EISA code, and nothing else.
If the driver is removed from the kernel (which can't happen at the
moment, since it is not modular), it doesn't matter... Once it has
registered as an EISA bus root, it doesn't get called anymore, the
core code does it all by itself.
So no, I truly don't think there's anything to do in this release
function.
Regards,
	M.
