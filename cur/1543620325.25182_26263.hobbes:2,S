He suggested letting shrink_caches find it.  But since we already know the 
page is free there's no sense scanning for it, so on balance I think your
approach is better.  An atomic_put_page, used from any context that could end 
up in an interrupt, would be better yet, just because it imposes the extra 
check only on users that require it.  Otoh, I did note davem's objection 
above.
