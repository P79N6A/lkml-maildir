Hmm, interesting, so in fact the scheduler does not always run the
highest priority runnable process?  Do you have a test case where
userspace would experience priority inversion due to this?
Maybe it has not been a problem as all the PI cases would involve two RT
processes that make system calls which end up blocking on a semaphore in
the kernel, which is bad RT design anyway - normally you would separate
the RT parts of the app which carefully avoid possibly blocking system
calls from the non RT parts and communicate via lock free ringbuffers or
a similar mechanism.
