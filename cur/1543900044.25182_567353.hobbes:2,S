Those were fixed and all has been well since as far as I know.

As far as I can tell the antifrag patches are stable and are significantly 
enhancing various aspects of the VM and also make it more reliable. SLUB 
can use it to increase scalability. MM has been using order 3 allocs via 
SLUB for months now without a problem. Without the antifrag patches order 
1 allocs could cause OOMs.
It opens the door for functionality that we wanted for a long time such a 
memory unplug etc.
