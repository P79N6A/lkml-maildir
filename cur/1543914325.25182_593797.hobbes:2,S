Subject: [RFC PATCH] Add a 'minimal tree install' target
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This is a somewhat rough first-pass at making a 'minimal tree'
installation target.  This installs a partial source-tree which you
can use to build external modules against.  It feels pretty unclean
but I'm not aware of a much better way to do some of this.
This patch works for me, even when using O=<buildtree>.  It probably
needs further cleanups.
Comments?
-----
Add a 'mintree-install' makefile target.
Red Hat and other distributions typically have some logic in their
kernel package build system to create/install 'minimalist source tree'
which contains enough state to build external modules against but is
much smaller than the entire build-tree.
This introduces similar logic, the guts of this was taken from a
Fedora Core spec file and mutilated to make it work for O=<...>
builds.

+# FIXME:cw Some parts of this are still icky, it's not clear how best
+# to clean some of this up.  Error handling is more or less
+# non-existent.  You could argue that this entire process should be
+# done differently (ie. using kbuild knowledge instead of a whole lot
+# of hard-coded magic here).
+
+# FIXME:cw If any of srctree, objtree or INSTALL_MINTREE_PATH have
+# spaces in them some parts of this will fail as-is, it shouldn't be
+# that hard to fix (it's not clear if the rest of t kbuild is clean in
+# that respect though)

+# This relies on the following environment variables being sane and
+# passed in from the Makefiles:

+#    INSTALL_MINTREE_PATH
+#    KERNELVERSION

+tgtdir="${INSTALL_MINTREE_PATH}"/${KERNELVERSION}/
