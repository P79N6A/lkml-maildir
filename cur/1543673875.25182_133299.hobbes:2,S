#include <linux/mempool.h>
and look at the functions, which implement this.
linux/mm/mempool.c is the actual implementation.
This is not exactly, what you want (you CAN allocate more than
your 10% from this pool and the amount over your minimum number
of pages to be reserved is free for the kernel to use), but
should be what you really need.
