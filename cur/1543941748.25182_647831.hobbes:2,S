Subject: [PATCH 7/9] firewire: fw-sbp2: logout and login after failed reconnect
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/3/204

If fw-sbp2 was too late with requesting the reconnect, the target would
reject this.  In this case, log out before attempting the reconnect.
Else several firmwares will deny the re-login because they somehow
didn't invalidate the old login.
Also, don't retry reconnects in this situation.  The retries won't
succeed either.
These changes improve chances for successful re-login and shorten the
period during which the logical unit is inaccessible.
