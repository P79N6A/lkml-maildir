It's important for internal profiling and logging, too.  INN, which
constantly profiles itself automatically as it runs, calls gettimeofday()
around 800 times a second on my main transit news server.  Hm.  That could
stand to be looked at, as that's rather high, but on the other hand to get
the profiling data that we want there aren't that many good alternatives.
Solaris also implements gettimeofday() as a special hand-coded system call
with considerably lighter setup.
