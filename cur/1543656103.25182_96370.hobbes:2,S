Boot with nmi_watchdog=1 (smp) or nmi_watchdog=2 (smp or up), cat
/proc/interrupts to verify that NMI is being used.  If the problem is a
disabled spinloop then the watchdog will trip after 5 seconds and give
you a trace which can be run through ksymoops.  If that trace does not
give enough data to debug the problem, apply the kdb patch[*], read
Documentation/kdb and start digging, bt first and debug from there.
