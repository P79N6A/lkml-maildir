It does seem odd, but indeed, a confirmation from someone with authority
would be nice before digging in to a cleanup-process like this. Try e-mailing
the maintainer of the code directly, since it doesn't seem like anyone
feels like wasting any time on this :)
Nice job on the discovery though, if this is true, these things really should
be removed.
