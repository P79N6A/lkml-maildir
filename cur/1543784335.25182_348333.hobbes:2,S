Hello Andrew,
I found a problem regarding to multi device support (Linux software Raid).
The problem first appears now in 2.6.13-mm2, that the kernel didn't initialize the md devices.
2.6.13-mm1 works very well, and everything is okay.
Also one strange thing I found was that my SATA devices were initialized a-sync/disordered e.g
SATA1 with one hdd then something like USB and IPv4 and such and at least SATA3: with 2nd hdd.
That I've never seen this order init order before. Seems to be mixed all around.
I tried irqpoll,pci=routeirq with no success.
I can't provide some logs, because I can't grep the dmesg since it doesn't boot.
There are changes in libata driver for sata_nv? Or md driver changes that cause that?
Thanks
Best regards
