Well, really I don't see how apps would want to use it in any way that was
correct.  You can't use it as the size of an array.  If it WERE defined as
INT_MAX...  :)
On the other hand, some obsessive-compulsive part of me says that a constant
like that SHOULD be exposed.  Which is why I asked about doing either a
sys_sysconf() call to expose those, or adding something to
sysfs/procfs/somethingfs to gather all the sysconf-mandated constants and
maybe other kernel constants.

64k makes our users happy.  It was a concession that had to be made.  Now
that the infrastructure for allocating, sorting, and searching is in place,
any user can change NGROUPS_MAX to 128k or 256k or INT_MAX and recompile -
no other work needed.  That's far better than where we were.
Of course, if we DON'T expose things like NGROUPS_MAX, then userspace won't
know if the user changes it to 256k.  But then again, what would they be
using it for that would not be wrong?  I'm not sure it is for the kernel to
say "you don't need to know this".
