I don't think you can realistically expect all open source licenses like
the BSD one to be accomodated. Otherwise people would ship binary apps
linked with a BSD licensed libpatent.o/c that was useless to anyone. The
GPL restrictions happen to work very nicely in terms of making a patent
available for free software (or one definition thereof), the BSD license
alas doesn't.
