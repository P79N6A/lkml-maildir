This comes up a lot with regards to USB devices too.  One of the
usb-serial drivers (the edgeport driver) did something like this by
looking at the topology of the USB bus and where a specific device was
(it was also helped by unique serial numbers) and allowed the devices to
be assigned device nodes based on the topology and a small user space
program.  I'm going to try to do this for all usb-serial devices in 2.5
I can see a scheme like this being very useful for all USB, FireWire,
scsi, etc type of devices.
And no, I don't think that having some type of device naming "database"
is overkill and will eventually make it into parts of the kernel (the
"database" living outside of the kernel of course...)
