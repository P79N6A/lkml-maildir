Er, I did not make the point clear enough, drat.
mknod /dev/ide-service c 10 ???
mknod /dev/scsi-service c 10 ???
These would be char devices that would allow one to pass a struct to an
ioctl to do device or host services that normally have to attempted by
opening the device desired.  This fails if you are trying to unload the
driver (with KMOD enabled) so that you could switch devices or change
driver types.  Yes this is the migration to a hotswap^H^H^H^H^H^H^H
general host/device services calls.
