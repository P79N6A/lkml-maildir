   I think he meant something like this:
( 0,  0)
( 1,  0)
( 0,  1)
(-1,  0)
( 0, -1)
( 2,  0)
( 1,  1)
( 0,  2)
(-1,  1)
(-2,  0)
(-1, -1)
etc.
   Rationals are countable since they're the product of the integers
(numerator) and the natural numbers without zero (denominator). You
can count them in a similar way to the above "spiral", making sure
that you don't count 1/2 and 2/4 as two different numbers. :)
   Hugo.
