kallsyms_lookup_size_offset() ?
Granted it is a little bigger, but it tells exactly what it does and 
there are not that many users that we have to write this name all that 
often.

You tell me, since you're proposing the change ;)

Maybe change the name to kallsyms_is_kernel_addr, because this function 
does more things than what the generic name implies.

<minor nitpick>
Why not just:
 > if (is_kernel_addr(addr))
 >	return !!get_symbol_pos(addr, symbolsize, offset);
 >
 > return !!module_address_lookup(addr, symbolsize, offset, NULL);
and just get rid of "rv" completely?

I agree with Arjan here. If kallsyms_lookup wasn't exported, I don't see 
a reason to export this either.
Everything else seems fine.
