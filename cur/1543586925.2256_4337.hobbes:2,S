That's not a sufficient way to upgrade.  The tar files are there for
people who are porting the driver to other platforms.  You should always
use the patches to upgrade as they often touch other portions of the
Linux kernel that need fixes in order to work correctly with the
aic7xxx driver.

To be expected as you didn't apply the patch to scsi_lib.c that makes
scsi_unblock_host() actually run the device queues to start the system
back up again.
I'm working on an html page for my site that should explain all of
the upgrade proceedures.
