I can't imagine how this would interest them. The mainstream press
might be mildly interested in the whole free software idea.
Version 2.2 of the Linux kernel would be hard to sell to them.
As I was writing, I kept thinking about InfoWorld. Hopefully I wasn't
too far off from that target. The magazines read by senior MIS people
seem most important to me, whatever they may be.

Not my department at all. (and damn they sound silly!)

Actually, I most wanted to drag out ideas and hopefully find several
people better than myself.
