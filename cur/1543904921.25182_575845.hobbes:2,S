Hi.
During the Linux kernel compilation, I need to compile some modules
which are necessary for the system boot.
I localized these modules analyzing the modules which are
automatically loaded at the startup of my Debian system whith the
standard Debian kernel, through the output of the "lsmod" command.
I tried to search for these modules in the "menuconfig" kernel
configuration program, but I cannot find some of them, not even
searching in the .config file.
How I can find what items in "menuconfig" I need to activate (marking
it with "m") to compile the modules I need for the system startup?
Thank you very much for your help!
Bye.
