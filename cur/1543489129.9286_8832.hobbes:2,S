- When the distributed nodes are seperated by a slow network and one
  wants to push aspects of computation closer to the source of the 
  data (i.e. preprocess at the origin and send postprocessed data
  over the link).
- When only some of the distributed nodes have access to resources
  which one wants to make part of the computation.
All just instances of: when certain aspects of the computation are
cheaper/"more feasible"/"only possible" at a certain subset of nodes.

Not necesarilly. The above scenarios are typically heterogenous, and
those not easily tractible by DSM.
