As far as the VFS is concerned non-directory mounts are perfectly fine.
There's a lot of use cases for non-directory bind-mounts and at least
some for regular filesystems with a non-directory root.  E.g. the streams
folks are using something like that.    Solaris even ships with non-directory
root filesystems mounted by default these days.
