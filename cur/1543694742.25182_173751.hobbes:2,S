Good grief.  It worked.
echo -n disk > /sys/power/state
No special preparations, no funky scripts, I didn't even have to unload any 
modules or feed strange command line options to grub.  It just... worked.  
(Even the network connection came back up. :)
Congratulations.
Rob
P.S.  (I am breathlessly waiting for my newly resumed system to panic on me, 
but so far... :)
