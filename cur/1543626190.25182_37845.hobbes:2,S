To be fair, I've had far less trouble with
nvidia drivers than with some of the
open source dri ones -
But it's best if you can reproduce the bug
without the nvidia driver loaded, to remove
all doubt.
If 3D graphics support is needed on that
box, perhaps a  cheap voodoo3 would
get you going in the meantime.  :-)
Hopefully some nvidia folks lurk on the list,
in case it is somehow related...
