I was trying to make the names more readable for the rest of us ;).
In the short term, there is seldom a reason to change names,
as it impacts the current experts more than it helps others.
Over a sufficiently long term, everyone is an 'other'.  Most
of the people who will have reason to want to understand this
code over the next five years are not experts in it now.
