That still means you could use the same infrastructure and now forward
these events to inotify-ish clients, right?

still means it could be a client to the same core event processing code
and filesystem hooks, right?

Nor should the auditing code.  There's no way to find a good name for an
inode _at all_, and only the last pathname component for a dentry.  If you
try anything else your code is broken and will not get anywhere the mainline
kernel.

Or build inotify ontop of your system.  It's not like inotify is perfect
as-is (it's not, the userland interface is extremly horrible)
