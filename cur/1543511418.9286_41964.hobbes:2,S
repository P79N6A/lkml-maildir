>> I am building ide.2.2.12.19991001.patch now.
Andre, Tom, (and all the rest),
I had a problem with the HPT366 on an ABit BP6 sharing an IRQ with a tulip
ethernet card. I had already tried to swap some PCI cards around, but
since their are only 4 interrupts for 2 ethernets, AGP, sound (PCI), bttv,
usb and hpt, there will always be some cards sharing interrupts. The setup
were the hpt and the tulip shared an interrupt was the only functional
combination, except that it crashed after a while.
I had already given up on using the hpt on the bp6, but yesterday I tried
the ide.2.2.13pre14.19991001 patch on a 2.2.13pre14. I checked the
spinlock and the 0x43 -> 0x44, but they both seemed to be fixed already.
I am now running the resulting kernel. I've already had a hdparm -tT and a
tcpblast through the tulip running for some time, and it worked great. The
performance was what I expected.

Indeed, I have seen the same oops. But my system was idle, except for an
xmms (MP3 player).
I have one other small problem: hde (on the hpt) sometimes turns off dma.
This could be the result of a bad cable. The cable I am using is rather
long. But that brings up another problem: how can you connect all the
disks in a tower, when you can only use cables of 18 inch or 46cm?
Anyway, many thanks,
Raf.
