No! This is not the same thing at all.
You are asking the coder to provide a policy judgement as to whether or
not the users might care.
As far as I'm concerned, other users' MP3 player, X processes, and
keyboard response times can rot in hell whenever I'm busy writing out
data at full blast. I don't give a rats arse about user interactivity,
because my priority is to see the batch jobs complete.
However on another machine, the local administrator may have a different
opinion. That sort of difference in opinion is precisely why we do not
put this sort of policy in the filesystem code but leave it all in the
scheduler code where all the bits and pieces can (hopefully) be treated
consistently as a single policy, and where the user can be given tools
in order to tweak the policy.
TASK_NONINTERACTIVE is basically a piss-poor interface because it moves
the policy into the lower level code where the user has less control.

That is exactly the same rotten idea, just implemented differently. You
are still asking coders to guess as to what the scheduling policy should
be instead of letting the user decide.
