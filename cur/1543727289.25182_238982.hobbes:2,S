[...] Perhaps it would be better to resolve this using kallsyms. 
This way you could support the user passing a list of functions
they want to be traced. and you wouldn't need to add all these 
EXPORT_SYMBOLS.

Nit - it doesn't filter anything.

This looks a bit fragile. I don't think skb->data == iphdr is guaranteed
everywhere (I'm surprised it works for your dupack hook for example, Does it
really?). Better is to use skb->nh.iph, but that is also not true
everywhere. Better would be probably to let this be passed
by the individual hook function.
Also a Lindent run on the file couldn't hurt.
