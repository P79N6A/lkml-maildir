Hi list,
Just built a new machine with a Pioneer SATA DVD drive and linux
distro install CDs are not recognising it. The drive is connected to
the ICH9R southbridge of an Intel P35 chipset motherboard.
I can boot from the CD/DVD so the drive itself is working, but the
kernel reports the following:
scsi4: ahci
ata5: SATA link up at 1.5 Gbps (SStatus 113 SControl 300)
ata5.00: ATAPI, max UDMA/66
ata5.00: qc timeout (cmd 0xef)
ata5.00: failed to set xfermode (err_mask=0x104)
ata5.00: limiting speed to UDMA/44
ata5: failed to recover some devices, retrying in 5 secs
ata5: port is slow to respond, please be patient (Status 0x80)
ata5: port failed to respond (30 secs, status 0x80)

This is 2.6.19 (probably with a few distribution patches) on an
install CD. I also tried setting the SATA controller to a 'compatible
IDE' mode and the hard drives and DVD drive are detected and work
properly.
Any ideas what to try to get it working under AHCI?
