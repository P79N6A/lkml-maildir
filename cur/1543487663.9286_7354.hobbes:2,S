	If I recall correctly, the MCC dist had a packaged utility
called 'lockvc' or 'vclock' or somesuch that would lock not just the
specific VT involved, but prevent you from changing them as well.
	I'm not sure how that worked, or if it would be workable with
modern kernels (last time I used it was probably about 0.99pl1?).
Might be worth a look.
