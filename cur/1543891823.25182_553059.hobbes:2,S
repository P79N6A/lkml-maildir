No.
The CPU hog is running in the host. A single instance of lguest using
busybox is started in another shell. When it reaches a shell prompt,
-that- shell is occassionally unresponsive for long stretches.
For the purposes of CFS, of course, the shell running inside lguest is
invisible.
Also, for comparison, running the same kernel and disk image inside
qemu doesn't show any lag, despite being substantially slower (no
kernel/VT acceleration).
