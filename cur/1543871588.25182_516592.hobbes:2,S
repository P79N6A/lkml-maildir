It's awkward to layer a largely do-nothing patch like this on top of a
significant functional change.  Makes it harder to isolate the source of
regressions, harder to revert the do-something patch.

Does Ingo agree?

Did benh agree with that?
The patch unchangeloggedly adds a basic new structure to core mm
(fault_data).  Would be nice to document its fields, especially `flags'.
Please add less pointless blank lines.
How well has this been tested?  The ocfs2 changes?  gfs2?  We should at
least give those guys a heads-up.
Does anybody really pass a NULL `type' arg into filemap_nopage()?
This patch seems to churn things around an awful lot for minimal benefit.
