If chrooted user had gained root - he can do much more damage than that.
If your libraries are world-writable - you had asked for that, hadn't
you?

<shrug> 2.5 stuff. Requires extra argument on getattr/setattr/permission -
prototype change on 3 methods for something that is a feature and not a
fix for any specific bug...
If you want root-proof analog of chroot - fine, but that will require
at least taking away the ability to mount/umount anything. Otherwise
attacker will simply be able to remount everything he want r/w once he
had gained root. That can be done (e.g. by adding "can modify" flag
to namespace and doing something along the lines
	pid = clone(CLONE_NAMESPACE, NULL);
	if (!pid) {
		/* do all needed mount/umount work */
		pid = clone(CLONE_FREEZE_NAMESPACE, NULL);
		if (!pid) {
			/* we are set */
		}
		exit(0);
	}
which would give grandchild a namespace we want it to see and prohibit
any changes in said namespace, root or not)
