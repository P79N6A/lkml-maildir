As I read the gas info text, .subsection changes the current entry on
top of stack, it does not stack a new section/subsection pair.
.previous swaps the top of stack with the previous top of stack.  I
suspect that you would get different results if there was more than one
section on the stack.  In any case, .subsection 0 is "obviously correct".
