No, no. Constant gravity (like having the laptop sitting on the desk) 
"feels like" constant acceleration.
Dropping it out of the window should measure 0 m/sec^2, because the 
accelerometer is not working on an inertial referential (I hope this is 
the correct term in english...). For the accelerometer, this is just 
like the feeling of free falling inside an elevator: no gravity :)
