These days, it's mostly libstdc++ which is still developing; the
compiler side (name mangling, layout of virt tables, ...) is quite
stable these days; it's these occasional bugs which are found from 
time to time in the most obscure scenarios, which are often overstated.

Except that we have deeps stacks of libraries these days and things 
break apart if you need different versions of one library at the same
time ... 
D needs libs C and B, but C needs A and B needs A'.
In reality, the picture is many more levels deep.
Thus breaking libs all the time brings nice challenges for integrators
and ISVs as well. Fortunately, most libs don't do that.
