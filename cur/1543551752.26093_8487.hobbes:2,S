I agree. The main reason, imho, being the fact that we need <stdarg.h> and
that is found in one of those "private" locations so -nostdinc will hide
it unnecessarily and although the trivial hello.c would compile, a
slightly less trivial one (including mm.h/sched.h) won't. But your
commandline should compile anything and pick up <stdarg.h> correctly.
