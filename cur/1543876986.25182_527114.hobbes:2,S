So, it's a lot sooner than before. (BTW, isn't there anything
in debug log?) I see both CPUs did interrupt handling again.
Maybe it's a real locking problem. Here are some more
suggestions for testing (if you don't find anything better):
- try without SMP, so: 'acpi=off lapic nosmp'
- lock debugging turned on as much as possible
plus maybe for curiosity:
- different CONFIG_HZ
- 8139TOO_PIO = y
