In theory, yes. It makes the track longer, so it could in theory make 
something large not fit. In practice, there really are some readers 
which skip on audio when they see the blanks. As Joerg which ones, but 
other people have agreed that it does happen.
I have noted that even with it off my recent burners don't mind running 
out of data, so in most cases it won't hurt. Burning off NFS I see 7-10 
underruns typically.
