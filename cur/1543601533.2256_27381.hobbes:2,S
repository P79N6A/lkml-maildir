Don't worry about this one, fix is included in patch I posted last
Saturday, and will be rebasing, breaking up and submitting to Linus
in a couple(?) of days.  Basically, Zach Brown's patch to use
nr_swap_pages and total_swap_pages, but in rare case of concurrent
swapoff, does need to scan that swap_map (with appropriate locking)
to give sensible numbers without strange negatives at that time.
