First of all, you should let the compiler decide which way is the
fastest/best.
Second, a | is not a sequence point, while || is. The expression can
depend on that. It could be that if (a == b), that you should not use c.
It will also do all three, while one can be more then enough.
And last, there is such a thing as branch prediction, and I have no idea
which would be "better" for it :)
I also did some little test here comparing both, and the one with | seems
to be slower when using no optimization because it needs to do more
instructions. They got the same result using -O2, if only the third is
true. But then again, what do those stupid tests show.
