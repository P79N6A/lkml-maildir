What if you are allocating the buffer for another task. For instance,
a tool is attaching
to a running process and wants to use PEBS. The tool allocates and
initializes the
PEBS buffer and then attaches it to the task to monitor (which is
stopped). When the
task is scheduled again, it picks up the PEBS buffer, and DS_AREA is written to.

enable PEBS consists in writing a PMU MSR. Perfmon takes care of that.

The PEBS buffer (and thus DS_AREA) are remapped read-only.
There is another reason why the DS_AREA is exposed. This is the only way for
tools to see the current position in the PEBS buffer. They may want to poll on
that position index. The PEBS buffer is not necessarily full. What if
the session
terminates with a partial buffer. There must be a way for the tool to figure out
where the last sample is. By exposing DS read-only the index is always available
and always guaranteed current. Without this, the kernel would have to
extract the
index (pebs_get_index) and store it somewhere so the user can see it. This copy
could be tirggered by a PEBS buffer overflow or a stop of monitoring. Sampling
buffers formats currently do not have a stop callback but this can be
added easily.
