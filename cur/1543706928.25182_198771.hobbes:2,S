And as I just figured out, loadkeys has to be invoked again, also.
I can go to utf-8 with:
	setfont lat0-16
	kbd_mode -u
	loadkeys de-latin1-nodeadkeys
and return to latin-1 with:
	setfont lat1-16
	kbd_mode -a
	loadkeys de-latin1-nodeadkeys
Without the loadkeys after returning to latin-1 mode, I can no longer
input umlauts and other special characters correctly.
