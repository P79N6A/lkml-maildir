Indeed, I suspect you'll want to either fix this or remove
the code before submitting the patch.  Including dead code
right from the start seems kind of pointless.
Note that if you have the ndirty thing functional, the
nfract_stop_bdflush tunable isn't doing anything, since
kswapd would stop after ndirty pages ...

To make ndirty functional, you could either make the sleep
unconditional, or change the if condition to the following:
if (bdf_prm.b_un.ndirty > 0 || bdflush_stop())
	interruptible_sleep_on(&bdflush_wait);
