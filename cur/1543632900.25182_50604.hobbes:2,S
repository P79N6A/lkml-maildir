Hmm..
How about just making the interrupt code (ie do_IRQ()) or in the flags 
into the "parent" flags.
All of the flags should be "sticky one-bits", so just oring them should do 
the right thing.
That way we don't have to add nasty BUG checks to the code, and since 
we're already dirtying both cache-lines the extra overhead should 
literally be just the cost of doing one locked "orl".
