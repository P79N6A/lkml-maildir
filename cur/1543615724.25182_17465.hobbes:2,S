Looks sane - thanks. I see no harm in sending it to Linus. Could you run 
the blkmtd.c changes past spse@secret.org.uk first, though?

Not in my tree - strange. Oh well, I'll deal with it when 2.5 stabilises 
and I stop ignoring it.

Currently, it's only compiled in the iPAQ kernel tree, where it works - I'm
waiting for the iPAQ people and Russell to stop arguing about how it should
be done, so the result will work in the proper ARM tree (and hence Linus'
tree) too.
Btw, where did you get the address 'mtd@infradead.org' from? The list moved 
a while ago, and I was going to remove the forwarding some time soon.
