Providing integrity using only a synchronous IO semantic is so costly for
performances that I donnot even want to think for a second to such an
approach.  With 'full control' I meant 'full control on actual IO ordering
requirements to maintain integrity and consistency. I want to think of an
IO sub-system that allows to ask for 'ordering' requirements of the
reality of IOs.  For example, I think of logical IO services that allows
to provide order attibutes that look like those available in SCSI physical
IO management.  e.g. : SIMPLE, ORDERED and HEAD of QUEUE. This would allow
the logical IO layers in the O/S and the device to implement optimizations
_and_ also to provide the ordering required by the application.

An IO that has been completed by a device may still be in some device
buffer. If you want to be guarantee that the data are really written to
the device, then you also need to allow the application to have control
via the logical IO layer on the buffering of the physical datas that
are involved in the logical operations the application has asked for.

Raw IO, O_SYNC and 'but fsync() ;-)' is what is common at the moment or
most UNIX systems in order to guarantee consistency of data systems.  I
understand that one may want to implement boring commercial applications
using that semantic and that it may work enough for most applications.
Current database managers, for example, want kernels to just be wrappers
to physical IO services and memory management, because they want to have
portable code in user land and they have poorly optimized their software
using the commonly available SYNC/RAW IO services. If their portability
issues, probably motivated by some market domination strategy, lead to
such abominations, then I am not interested in their stuff.
Obviously, I think that any O/S should provide some direct IO services,
since there are applications that really need these services in order 
to work correctly, or will make a good use of this feature.
But I disagree strongly with the assertion of Raw IO or sync IO to be 
some panacea for dealing with data consistency. It is just what some 
dinausors, old-minded or $$-interested people want us to believe, in my
opinion.
