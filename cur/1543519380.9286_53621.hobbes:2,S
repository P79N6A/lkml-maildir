Ok, you mean the one that doesn't send RST to the last ACK of the three
way handshake if it has an ack_sequence number below the SYN-ACK sequence
number? (so by checking the IP-ID field and counting how many packets are
been sent on the wire by the server it's possible to guess the SYN-ACK
sequence number and complete the three way handshake with a spoofed
address) If I remeber well it's a brainer one liner fix. It should (I
hope) just be in solar's patches. I completly agree to address this as
it's violating rfc793.

Ok.

Hmm "evil packet" is a bit too much generic in order to fix this ;)).
I only care about these three issues. For all other points users should
upgrade to 2.2.x IMHO.
