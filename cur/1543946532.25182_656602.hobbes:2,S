Ok I added that. This is what I have now:
config CGROUPS
        bool "Control Group support"
        help
	  Control Groups enables processes to be tracked and grouped
	  into "cgroups". This enables you, for example, to associate
	  cgroups with certain CPU sets using "cpusets".
	  When enabled, a new filesystem type "cgroup" is available
	  and can be mounted to control cpusets and other
	  resource/behaviour controllers.
	  See <file:Documentation/cgroups.txt> for more information.
	  If unsure, say N.
I don't think that description is as clear as it could be. From
the non-kernel-developer point of view, that is. I'll read
Documentation/cgroups.txt more thoroughly and see if I can come
up with a better description.
Re "other resource/behaviour controllers", what in particular?
I take it that our current controllers are cpusets, scheduler,
CPU accounting and Resource counters?
