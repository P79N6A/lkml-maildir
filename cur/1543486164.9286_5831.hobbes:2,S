It's very more fun than that. The point is that we must have it not
running _while_ del_timer() is running. It doesn't care if it's not
running _after_ del_timer is been run.
In my last email I just specified well what I care in line
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, I quote myself:
>>we won't have the shaper->timer pending or _running_ anymore.

Your proposal doesn't assure the pending condition.
