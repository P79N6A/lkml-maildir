When something weird happens, it might be better to kill
init and have the machine reset itself after the panic
(echo 30 > /proc/sys/kernel/panic).
Killing all other things and leaving just init intact
makes for a machine which is as good as dead, without a
chance for recovery-by-reboot...
OTOH, I haven't heard of the OOM killer ever chosing init,
not even of people who tried creating these special kinds
of situations to trigger it on purpose.

Rik
