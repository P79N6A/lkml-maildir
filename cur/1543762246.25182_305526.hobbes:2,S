but, this cannot happen, because call_rcu() is used by RCU-write code.
so the important property seems to be that any active RCU-read section 
should keep at least one CPU's active_readers count elevated 
permanently, for the duration of the RCU-read section. It doesnt matter 
that the reader migrates between CPUs - because the RCU code itself 
guarantees that no callbacks will be executed until _all_ CPUs have been 
in quiescent state. I.e. all CPUs have to go through a zero 
active_readers value before the callback is done.
