this has not been true in the past (assuming that it's true today)
ok, if you look at a micro-enough level this may be true, but completely 
ignoring things like download times, the optimizations almost always boil 
down to trying to avoid jumps, loops, and decision logic at the expense of 
space.
however recent cpu's are significantly better as handling jumps and loops, 
and the cost of cache misses is significantly worse.
is the list of what's included in -O2 vs -Os different for different 
CPU's? what about within a single family of processors? (even in the x86 
family the costs of jumps, loops, and cache misses varies drasticly)
my understanding was that the optimizations for O2 were pretty fixed.

ignore things like download time for the moment. it's not significant to 
most people as they don't download things that often, and when they do 
they are almost always downloading lots of stuff they don't need (drivers 
for example)
users are trying to get better performance 90+% of the time when they 
select -Os. That's why it got moved out of CONFIG_EMBEDDED.
