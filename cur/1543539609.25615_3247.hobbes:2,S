It's policy. Policy does not belond to kernel. Period.

No. You :
  1. need access to hardware (if you have CAP_SYS_RAW) and then you'll have FULL
access to hardware
 or
  2. do not need access to hardware at all and removed CAP_SYS_RAW from system
If you need filtering - feel free to implement it in libata.so ...

This is bold accusation and if we'll get such accisating then we'll have to
point out that:
  1. DOS is non-ATA-ATAPI compliant
  2. Windows9X is non-ATA-ATAPI compilant
  3. WindowsNT/Windows2000 pro is non-ATA-ATAPI compilant
  4. Probably any other OS for PC out there are non-ATA-ATAPI compliat as well
All of above is right when you are superuser in system (Administator in
WindowsNT/Windows2000 case) in default configuration - just like Linux case.
For 1., 2. and 3. I know peoples who will be able to do working .VxD and .SYS
files to make ubuse of IDE/ATAPI drivers possible (I can try to find peoples
who will be able to do the same for FreeBSD, Mac OS, BeOS, etc if needed).
Then we'll have simple fact: if you are used your IDE/ATAPI drive in PC with
[almost] any PC OS you used it with non-ATA-ATAPI compilant and thus lost
warranty. I think on this stage general public can be notified and then
manufacturers will have BIG pressure to change specification.

And any such decision made at compile time can be changed in run-time via
clever poking in memory. I know how to do this with Windows9X/NT/2000pro
and Linux (at least).
