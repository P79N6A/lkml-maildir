Well, passing a single node to set_mempolicy() for MPOL_INTERLEAVE doesn't 
make a whole lot of sense in the first place.  I prefer your solution of 
allowing set_mempolicy(MPOL_INTERLEAVE, NODE_MASK_ALL) to mean "interleave 
me over everything I'm allowed to access."  NODE_MASK_ALL would be stored 
in the struct mempolicy and used later on mpol_rebind_policy().
