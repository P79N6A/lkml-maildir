Hi,
I read about 3.5G-per_process (or 3.5G/0.5G user/kernel space) in this
mailing list, but I don't find the details of how to do it. I have installed
Redhat7.2 (kernel 2.4.10enterprise) on a dual CPU 4G memory PC. I wrote a
simple program to use malloc to allocate memory, and it can never exceeds
3G. libhoard didn't help either. My question is:
[1] What need to be done for the kernel to support 3.5G or more user address
space per process?
[2] What need to be done at compilation time? Any option for
compiler/linker?
Thanks,
--Wenyong
