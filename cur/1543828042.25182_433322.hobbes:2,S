that is odd.
first of all this should use a mutex not a semaphore.
Second, if this isn't used in irq context, then just dropping the
"_irqsave" from the spinlocks should be enough to actually get rid of
the missed interrupts.... and if it is used there then I highly question
your use of semaphores etc...
