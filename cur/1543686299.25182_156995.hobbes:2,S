Salability means many things. I'm not sure which aspect you are talking
about, but a good thing with MSI is that it does not depend on I/O
APICs. A typical I/O APIC has 24 RTEs, and we need about 10 I/O APICs to
consume the vectors. 
You can make this scale on SMP systems. The vector-based approach would
be easier to extend it per-CPU because vectors are inherently per-CPU,
compared with IRQ-based. Today we have IRQ balancing as you know, and
the key part is to bind IRQ to a particular CPU (BTW, with our patch it
happens automatically because the balancer does not care if they are IRQ
or vector). 
Thanks,
Jun
