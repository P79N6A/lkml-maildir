Firstly, nice idea to actually comment the code ;-)
Re: __alloc_pages

Zonelist is not a zone, it's a list of zones suitable for the given 
zonemask on that pg_data_t in order of preference. Maybe I'm
just misreading your syntax.

I don't see how there could be "more that one zone in ZONE_NORMAL"?
There can only be one ZONE_NORMAL per pgdata_t. 
Look at build_zonelists to see how the fallback lists (zonelist) are built
up. 
There's one zonelist for each possible zonemask. Depending on the mask
we add one of:
1) ZONE_HIGHMEM, ZONE_NORMAL and ZONE_DMA
2) ZONE_NORMAL and ZONE_DMA
3) ZONE_DMA.
So there's no way there could be two ZONE_NORMAL's in a list, 
or that ZONE_NORMAL for that pgdat could be added twice.
