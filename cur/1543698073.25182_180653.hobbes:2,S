Hmm. That does reflect exactly what happened in my situation. I turned on
the tape drive, inserted a tape, and while it was busy rewinding, I inserted
the aic7xxx module.
I just tried inserting the module again, this time with no tape in the drive
as I turned it on and it initializes just fine and loads the st module. It
works fine doing everything else AFAIK.
But it still complains when I unload the modules..
