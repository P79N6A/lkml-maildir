the 2.5 series of kernels (since early ide changes) fails on my machine when
configuring the harddisks.
machine is a dual P-II 300 MHz, Intel BX chipset
two Promise UltraTx2 boards, PDC20268, with an IBM disk connected to every channel.
kernel 2.4.18 is still running ok for me. When running a 2.5.x kernel on
this same box, the cards seem te be assigned different interrupts (weird,
since the cards remain in the same slots etc.)
2.4.18: (works fine)
ide2 at 0xa800-0xa807,0xac02 on irq 17
ide3 at 0xb000-0xb007,0xb402 on irq 17
ide4 at 0xbc00-0xbc07,0xc002 on irq 18
ide5 at 0xc400-0xc407,0xc802 on irq 18
2.5.52: (lost interrupts)
ide2 at 0xa800-0xa807,0xac02 on irq 16
ide3 at 0xb000-0xb007,0xb402 on irq 16
ide4 at 0xbc00-0xbc07,0xc002 on irq 16
ide5 at 0xc400-0xc407,0xc802 on irq 16
Regards,
Frank.
