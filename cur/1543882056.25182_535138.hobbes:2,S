Right and we need to create series of other approaches that we then label 
"non-hack" to replace it.

There have been numbers of people that have argued the same point. Just

The code paths can stay the same. You can switch CONFIG_LARGE pages off
if you do not want it and it is as it was.
If you would have a look the patches: The code is significantly cleanup 
and easier to read.
