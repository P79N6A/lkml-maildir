(somewhat OT..)
Perhaps it's just me, but i think it'd be nice that a new kernel version is
released every time a security issue is found.
Yes, vendors update their kernels themselves, but there's a *lot* of people
in linux who run kernel.org kernels, and it's hopefully to keep working
that way.
Those people  can also update themselves their kernel, also true. But the
security issues found in linux are not announced anywhere but mailing list
and sites like slashdot. Many people who run kernels from kernel.org don't
read slashdot or mailing lists and don't that there's a need of updating their
kernels. A new kernel version every time a security issue is found would help
for those people, or at least a "security updates" section in kernel.org's
webpage. Right now there's no "official" way of announcing those updates, and
I think it's a serious lack for a OS which is so widely used.
