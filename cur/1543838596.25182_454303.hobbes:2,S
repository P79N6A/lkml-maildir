In my experience, the way to avoid overruns on a serial port was to use
a buffered serial port UART (such as a 16550A for example).  I remember
my 486 wasn't reliable about 19200 or 38400 (depending on how busy the
cpu was) when using an 8250.  Using a 16550A based card and I could do
115200 without any issues since the UART had a 16 byte buffer to help
out the system.  Unless your 386 has an add in card for the serial port,
it almost certainly has a very crappy UART and it would be very hard to
make it work reliably at higher speeds.
