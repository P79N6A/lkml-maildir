I'm not sure how useful this feature would be.  Also,
there are a bunch of corner cases in which you cannot
limit the number of processes mapping a page, think
about eg. mlock, nonlinear vmas and anonymous memory.
All in all I suspect that the cost of such a feature
might be higher than any benefits.
cheers,
Rik
