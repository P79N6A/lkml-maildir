If you spend the effort to do _that_, you might as well clone your BK 
tree and prune it back to a state which conceivably has only the 
changes which you depend on.
Another problem with that approach, however, is that if everybody 
does it then the kernel's version tree, as evident in "bk revtool", 
gets totally unreadable. It is already an order of magnitude too 
complicated.  :-(
