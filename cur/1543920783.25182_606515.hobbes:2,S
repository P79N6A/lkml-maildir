They pretty much *all* do, as far as I can tell.
For example, to look at the very first one:
	#define for_each_sg(sglist, sg, nr, __i)        \
		for (__i = 0, sg = (sglist); __i < (nr); __i++, sg = sg_next(sg))
let's say that "nr" is 1 (and that's also the allocation size), and look 
at what that causes.
Right. It causes us to do "sg = sg_next(sg)" once. Which will do what? It 
will increment sg (so that it now points past the single-entry array!) and 
then it will dereference that invalid entry to see if it's a chain entry!
And no, "1" is not the special case. The special case is *any* time when 
you iterate over as many sg entries as you allocated. You *always* have to 
leave the last one unused in order to avoid this "access past the end" 
problem.
The alternative is to rewrite the loop, but it's going to be ugly as hell, 
and you need to do that for *every*single*user* of sg_next(). You can 
re-write the above loop as something like
	define for_each_sg(sglist, sg, nr, __i)
		for (__i = 0, sg = NULL ;
			__i < (nr) && sg = (sg ? sglist : sg_next(sg) ;
			__i++))
but the important part here is that you must do that "sg_next()" *after* 
you have broken out of the loop, and you must basically do it one less 
time than you go through the loop.
IOW, any loop that leaves "sg" pointing to past the array is inevitably 
buggy, because it will have accessed that last past-tne-end entry as part 
of tryign to decide whether it should perhaps follow a link.

See above. I think the exact sequence may be:
    ata_qc_issue()
	(implicitly inlined) ata_sg_setup()
		(explicitly inlined) dma_map_sg()
			(macro) for_each_sg()
but I didn't see if there are other possible chains that get you to one of 
those invalid sg loops.
And no, it's *not* just for_each_sg(). Pretty much any "natural" loop over 
the SG list will cause it, because that's how you write loops in C: you 
almost always end up pointing to one past the last entry after the loop.
