Yes it works, it's the problem i had all along =)
As to how to make it happen thats a bit harder...
To me it seems like it's a combination of several connections and
somewhat high bandwidth but you have to send data for it to happen...
To me it usually happens when seeding files via Bittorrent, but it seems
like it has to be somewhat special circumstances to actually trigger it.
I use jumbo frames, my lan is gigabit, to my firewall. From the firewall
it's common 1500 mtu 100mbit and i doubt that this has anything to do
with it (if it's not a 'number of frames that can be stored' problem and
thus the mtu limits it to a really small value making it easier to
trigger)
Well, thats my thoughts atleast but then i just got up after having
slept 5 hours, so =)
