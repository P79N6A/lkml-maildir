Any chance you'll have a tree tagged with older releases?
Is someone with access to BK working on that?
I do a lot of patch merges where someone sends me a 2.6.10 patch. 
Presuming the fix is still valid, I'll clone to 2.6.10, merge the patch, 
pull 2.6.latest into the 2.6.10-based repo, then push the whole she-bang 
into one of my for-upstream repos.
