In a perfect world we could do both.  :)  S3 for example tries to pack a
lot of logic into their BIOS, but there have been some bad bugs in it,
in the past, too.

Not the really important stuff...   Most video cards you can reprogram
the modes, but memory timings are often up to the board not chip maker. 
The only place the board maker can store their funky logic is in the
BIOS.  Sometimes you can simply read the BIOS data and act upon it,
sometimes not [without the BIOS source code anyway].
