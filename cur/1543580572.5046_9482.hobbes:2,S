Yes, I've noticed this too. 
I concluded that to the kernel there is something magic about
"init=/bin/someprogram":  The program doesn't get PID 1 anymore. 
I used to have a script there fire up X and then exec init inside an
Xterm. I gave up on this after that junk started happening.
Oh, and Init refuses to be useful if it doesn't end up with PID 1.
