Subject: drivers/media/video/saa7115.c misreports max. value of contrast and saturation

For changes to V4L2_CID_CONTRAST and V4L2_CID_SATURATION, the value is
checked by "if (ctrl->value < 0 || ctrl->value > 127)" yet the maximum
value in v4l2_queryctrl is set to 255 for both of these items.  This
means that programs (like MythTV) which set the contrast and saturation
to the midvalue (127) get *full* contrast and saturation.  (It's not
pretty.)
Setting the maximum values to 127 solves this problem.
Please copy me on responses.
Thank you.
