Two additional data points:
* Aside from the fillmem segfault and the leaky results from
/proc/meminfo, there was no other obvious sign of a problem.  I was able
to switch over to Netscape (presumeably swapping some pages in, after 3
fillmem runs) and type my bug report just fine.
* During shutdown, I got four "VM: undead swap entry" messages.  I guess
this was at 'swapoff -a' time.
