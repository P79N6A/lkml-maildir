Subject: [PULL request] md update for 2.6.29 (includes change to fs/block.c)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi Linus,
 here is my drivers/md pull request for the 2.6.29 merge window.
 The most interesting change is
      md: make devices disappear when they are no longer needed.
 which is functionality I have tried to add in the past and always got
 wrong.  I think it is right this time :-)
 It involves a change to fs/block_dev.c.
 The reason for this change is the there is a period between ->probe
 being called on a device, and ->open being call, where the gendisk is
 not reference counted but must not go away.
 This interacts badly which md's (questionable but historic) approach
 of devices being created by ->probe.
 The fs/block_dev.c change allows the open to fail in a new way
 (ERESTARTSYS) so that we loop back and call ->probe, so if the
 gendisk does get removed in that window, we handle the situation
 gracefully.   The changelog (and code) give more details.
 This was discussed on linux-kernel with Al Viro and Tejun Heo without
 a clear resolution.  There was a feeling that some sort of cleanup in
 the block layer could make this unnecessary and would fix other
 issues, but no clear direction on the cleanup was found, nor were
 any clear problems with my approach identified.
 Also of some note is 
         md: Allow md devices to be created by name.
 which provides a new way of creating md devices and allows us to
 provide the name for kernel-internal use, so it isn't always 
 md0 or md27, but can be md_bitbucket or md_scratch.
 Finally
       md: fix bitmap-on-external-file bug.
 fixes a bug that I let in to 2.6.28 fairly late due to insufficient
 testing.  It is flagged for -stable.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
