Andrew, what is your position on merging this into your 2.6.25 queue 
please? David has fixed all the issues that came up during review, so it 
seems to be that it's time for the driver to be merged during the upcoming 
merge window.
If you take it, I am perfectly fine with you dropping the 
ipwireless_cs git tree from -mm lineup.
Thanks,
