That seems pretty reasonable to me.  The fallback order that's
implemented in move_task_off_dead_cpu() seems very similar to what needs
to be done for memory.  However, those operations might have to occur a
bit earlier in the process for memory.
Consider a case where a zone is shrinking, and memory is being moved out
of a section inside of it.  We should try to allocate the memory to move
pages from the shrinking area in the same zone, the same node, then in
other ever-less-optimal NUMA nodes.
But, this has to occur in any removal case, even before the node is
completely gone.  So, for now, I think that we probably need to go about
the normal removal process, and make sure to update mems_allowed if a
process's page is migrated to a place that wasn't in its mems_allowed.
Is it easy to tell if a given page was influenced by a cpusets
allocation?  How would the memory removal code know which task[s] to go
and update?

My only other idea is just to leave it alone for now.  We're still a
good bit of time away from removing NUMA nodes and I'll probably have a
much better idea about what we need when that occurs.  
Somebody correct me if you disagree, but I don't see merging memory
removal as something that's going to happen in the next couple of
months.  The work that I'm doing on it now is more so that I can
robustly test addition over, and over, and over again and get
_additiion_ in a mergable state.
I hate to have you or anyone else do a bunch of work for something that
isn't in-tree or planned to be in-tree for a while.  We'll fix it when
we get there :)
