Is it actually _expected_ that we'll encounter a NULL EIP during the unwind?
Because if it is not, then this is a good indication that the unwind
attempt hasn't worked, so we should fall back to some other approach if we
encounter a NULL at _any_ point in the backtrace, not the start.
Creating too much information is waaaaaaaaaaay better than creating too
little.  (This is a case in point - we're trying to fix a bug here and the
unwinder is preventing that).
In fact, if there's any means at all by which we can detect that something
has gone wrong with the unwind we should fall back.

- Make the code robust and able to detect "unexpected" states at all
  points through the process.  If at the end of the process we see that we
  have encountered an unexpected state,
  - emit a diagnostic so Jan can work out if there's a way to improve
    the unwinder in this situation
  - do a traditional backtrace as well.
