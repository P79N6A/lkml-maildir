You are ranting about SUSE (and the incompetentness of other Linux people)
on _this_ mailing list, so bring the facts _here_ (or at least the pointers
to them). Waving hands and blaming people without mentioning what exactly
did they do wrong is (1) impolite, (2) wasting bandwidth.
				Have a nice fortnight
