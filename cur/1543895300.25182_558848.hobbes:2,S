The obvious question of course is whether actually reverting this
changeset fixes your problem? I would be very surprised if it did.
If it does make a difference, please provide the values for
CONFIG_HOTPLUG, CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG and CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU from your
.config.
I would wager that you only have CONFIG_HOTPLUG=y, in which case, the
only difference over previous kernels will be that zone_batchlist() is no
longer flagged as __init, and so it won't be freed -- this was the reason
for the "special section" comment in the changeset, as currently it's
left hanging around for folks that aren't doing cpu/memory hotplug, since
__devinit was the closest that both cpu and memory hotplug had in common.
I can't imagine that this would impact you at all, though.
