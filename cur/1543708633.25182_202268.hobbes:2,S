Interrupt priorities are supported and have been supported
since the first cascaded interrupt controllers and, now
with the APIC. The interrupt priorities are enforced by
hardware. There are no "software interrupt priorities"
because we have more than one interrupt, already prioritized
by the hardware. The basic PC/AT has IRQ0 through IRQ15 interrupt
sources. The IO-APIC code emulates this. The priorites go like this:
Highest priority
  |
IRQ0	PIT channel 0
IRQ1	Keyboard
IRQ2	Cascade to second controller
IRQ8
IRQ9
IRQ10
IRQ11
IRQ12
IRQ13
IRQ14
IRQ15
IRQ3	Serial 1, Serial 3
IRQ4	Serial 0, Serial 2
IRQ5	Floppy disk
IRQ6
IRQ7	Printer

Lowest priority
You can't do software interrupt priorities with hardware interrupt
controllers unless you funnel everything into one master ISR that
ACKs the hardware, then sorts through some priority lists. The
result is an abortion that wastes CPU cycles and throws away
the hardware advantage that you already have.
If you have an architecture that has only one hardware interrupt,
then you have no choice but to impliment some sort of software
priority scheme. This is not what we have on the ix86.
