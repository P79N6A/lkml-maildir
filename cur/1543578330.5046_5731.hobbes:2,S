	So? copy_to_user() and put_user() will refuse to scramble the
kernel memory. IOW, dirent can be out of the userspace. Hell, user could
call getdents() and pass it a kernel pointer. Try it and you'll see what
happens.
	BTW, in that particular line we are actually even protected from
getting too large dirent, since if the sum was out of the user space we
would die several lines above upon copy_to_user().
