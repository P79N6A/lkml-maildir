GNUtar's --listed-incremental mode working on a filesystem with unix
semantics covers all the problems including changing owners or permissions
and  picking up old files that appear in a new location as a result of
renaming a directory above.  If you are doing backups of a live filesystem
you have to live with changes that happen in the current second anyway.
