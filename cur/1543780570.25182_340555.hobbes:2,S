How so? In NFS the only case that can be tricky is O_EXCL, and that
simply _cannot_ be done inside nfs_lookup without confusing the VFS. 
Instead, we always create a negative dentry, and then do the actual
atomic exclusive create inside vfs_create().
We can do the ordinary atomic open(O_CREAT) inside nfs_lookup though. If
that fails, then we simply return the error as an ERR_PTR in the dentry
(i.e. the lookup won't succeed).
The only case which we have that can be iffy is the case of open() on an
existing dentry. If that fails, then we drop the dentry and force an
uncached lookup in order to get it all right.

There is quite a bit of code out there that assumes it is free to stuff
things into nd->mnt and nd->dentry. Some of it is Al Viro's code, some
of it is from other people.
For instance, the ESTALE handling will just save nd->mnt/nd->dentry
before calling __link_path_walk(), then restore + retry if the ESTALE
error comes up.

The only user of that code is NFSv4, and we will never even try to
allocate a file if the OPEN call returned an ESTALE.

That is a bug that needs to be fixed in the intent.open.flags. We don't
ever want to be opening the file for writing at the filesystem level
when the user specified open for read.
