From Linux Weekly News:
'In the meantime, however, the best advice is to find a job at Red Hat or
marry someone there. The "friends and family" allocation of the IPO is
about the only way that the average investor will get shares of this hot
little number.'
Are there any female geeks at RedHat I can marry? =8)
Cheers,
Alex
