Ah.  Yeah, you found the real bug.  I exchanged info with Solar Designer;
he also tracked it down and came up with a fix, that is a bit more
conservative.  
I had done tests after patching my machine with my fix, but as I had found
the problem on a loaded system and tested later on an unloaded system
(where things worked fine) it turns out I hadn't fixed the problem at all.
