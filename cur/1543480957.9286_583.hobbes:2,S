    There should be a copy of Disk Manager that you can download from Quantum's
    web site.  Get it install it and that should work around the 8GB limit in
    your BIOS.
Uh, what a terrible answer!
There is no mention of any strange operating systems in the question.
I hope you do not think that Linux needs a Disk Manager (or could use one,
for that matter).
