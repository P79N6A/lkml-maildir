Which version of hwclock?  That does seem like a bug in that
particular version.  If it's in util-linux-ng or busybox,
please send in a patch.  I don't think anyone should be
deploying *new* systems using *old/unmaintained* util-linux.
I'll suspect this is on some util-linux version, since I'm
quite sure that I've had busybox based systems that don't
show this misbehavior.  Haven't had occasion to use non-PC
RTCs with a util-linux-ng version; I wouldn't call a bug in
such combinations a kernel regression, either...
I think the preferred solution never returns invalid times as
valid.  Some RTC drivers do this themselves:
        int my_rtc_read_time(struct device *dev, struct rtc_time *time)
	{
		... read the hardware into *time ...
		return rtc_valid_tm(time);
	}
Or rtc_valid_tm() might be checked in the RTC framework glue,
to provide more uniform behavior at the framework level.
Either way, it's not unknown that an un-initialized RTC have
undefined state, and thus return invalid times until they've
been set (using wall clock, NTP, or whatever).
