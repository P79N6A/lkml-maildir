I'm not sure I understand the message, either. I can confirm that SiS's
LPC-to-ISA bridges can change their device ID based on writes to the PCI
config space -- 0x08 and 0x18 are both valid ids for that hardware.
Eric, if you'll send me an lspci -xxx on the ISA bridge run under both
kernels, that may be interesting. Then the fun part will be finding what
changed in the kernel to cause that.
In any event, I think it would be valid to have sis900 check for both
ids.
