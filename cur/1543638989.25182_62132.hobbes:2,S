The embarrasing thing is, I can't boot back to a working kernel. Having completed a marathon compilation I discover that it doesn't work even where it used to. Almost as if something physical has been blown to smithereens.
I'm not (overly) crazy. It _did_ work in 2.4.19-pre10-ac1+preempt. RealOne Player was bound through the environment variable AUDIO=/dev/dsp3 and gqmpeg had been configured to use /dev/dsp2.
Btw, what I called 'a cry from the wilderness' is heavily distorted audio, at a volume about twice as high as the working channels are set to (which practically means maximum...)
You won't hear from me again unless a miracle happens...
Sorry to have wasted peoples time/bandwidth,
