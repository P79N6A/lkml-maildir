Hello,
Thank you for the replys.
I try to phrase differently.
I made a simple kernel module that do 'hello world'. The module will be
called when I do 'modprobe' or 'insmod' to load it into the memory.
When is the function, init_module(), in the module called in the case 
the module is compiled as a built-in one? (Not M but Y in .config)
Can I specify the exact time of calling the function, init_module() in
the module?
