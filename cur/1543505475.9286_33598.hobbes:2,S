Various implementations of writel() do stuff to stall the pipeline a bit
anyway.  It's really a convenience/speed tradeoff.  IMHO writel() should
continue to "do the right thing" as it currently does, regardless of its
bus, while allowing saavy driver writers to employ BUS_writel() if they
so desire.
My main motivation is keeping the codebase the same across multiple
buses.  The 'if' has to occur somewhere, if your driver supports
multiple buses.  I would rather have the ifs in a common place,
writel(), to avoid
	void vga_mm_wcrt (caddr_t vga_base, unsigned char reg, unsigned char
val)
	{
		if (zorro_bus) {
			zorro_writeb
			zorro_writeb
		} else if (pci_bus) {
			...use pci_writeb to duplicate above logic...
		} else if (sbus) {
			...use sbus_writeb to duplicate above logic...
		}
	}
