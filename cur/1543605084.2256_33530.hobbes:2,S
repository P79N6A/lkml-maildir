May have a look in this one, it took me some time to figure out, how
to mount root at v3 (",v3" appended to --rootdir option of mknbi-linux)
Since then, I see far less problems here.
FYI: I'm using 2.4.5 + trond's patches on a wide range (AMD K6/200, P2/350, 
P3/600, AMD K7/1200, 128-768 MB, all asus + 3c90* + mga*) of diskless WSs 
here. I'm writing this on a 1.2g with pristine 2.4.12 and it feels fine, too 
(2d, 3:51 up). A couple of .9/.10-ac? releases gave some sluggish vm 
behaviour, though. OTOH, I'm using reiserfs on the server (2.4.7) with some 
patches, not xfs. But will give xfs a try on a server test config by the end 
of this week on a dual K7 XP1700+ ;-) 
To my experience, it's important to put enough ram into the boxes, since
I couldn't get them to swap via nbd. They usually run a full featured KDE2 
environment, StarOffice 5.2, vmware, IOW: all this heavy stuff with heavy 
regaled users ;-)
