Subject: [GIT PULL] FireWire updates

Linus, please pull from the for-linus branch at
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ieee1394/linux1394-2.6.git for-linus
to receive the following updates for the firewire subsystem and one
regression fix for the ieee1394 subsystem.  They fix
  - I/O errors with firewire-sbp2 if the PCI bus became slightly busy,
  - I/O errors with some LSIL (ex Symbios) based targets (2.6.25-rc1
    regression in case of sbp2),
  - asynchronous reception on systems with memory outside cache-
    coherent range,
  - machine check exception when resuming or reloading firewire-ohci
    on PowerMacs, PowerBooks, iBooks,
  - split transactions with big endian CPUs.
There are also a small documentation update and sparse annotations in
there.
I consider this batch OK in this late -rc phase because the most
intrusive change was easy to test on a range of machines, and the other
changes are very local and were therefore also rather easy to verify and
test. The PPC PMac parts are already known to work from ohci1394.
I will follow up with a combined full log and diff.  Diffstat and
shortlog:
