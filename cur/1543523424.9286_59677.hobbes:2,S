Funny quip of the moment just happens to be....
Linux is like a tent:

I've been noticing this in 2.2.14 -- I thought it was just that the 
computer was a slow piece of junk (486/DX2-66) but it may not be.  I can 
try other kernels and see if the problem seems to reproduce itself.  I'm 
hesitant to do so though because it takes about a half day to compile a 
new kernel (only 16MB RAM) and during which time the thing is worthless 
for it's normal functions (aside from routing IP packets, which seem to 
get through come rain, shine, or CRC errors....).
So if anyone has a specific kernel version speak now or forever hold 
your peace :)  The machine is a semi-production machine so I'd rather 
not 2.3 it but if it's necessary no problem and can do.

Same thing here -- Doesn't necessarily happen while swapping AFAICT but 
then again it could be just before, I do have a slow IDE subsystem that 
has been known to give me some grief (I run hdparm -u 1 /dev/hd? for 
this reason...)
