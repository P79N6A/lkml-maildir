I will not reply on this by now, becouse I need some time to think it over.

No not quite. I think once again that in fact the only missunderstanding between
us is on the e-mail communication level. Please just have a close enough
look at the patch itself. I have put some comments in here and there
which should explain things a bit more. Thereafter I think you will see
that mainly the only difference in our gals in whatever we call it 
typedef struct __kdev_t  kdev_t;
or directly typedef struct blk_dev_struct;
In esp. At some point in time the blk_dev array will be changed to an entierly
dynamic array of handler struct for devices not just major numbers.
Once again i think the only difference between my approach and yours is that
I'm aimin at the whole issure from the bottom (read device handling part)
instead of starting by the top (kdev_t type and passing semantics).
This is becouse I think that the lower level stuff is just a prerequsite
for the second. Surely at the finish line I see too that kdev_t (or whatever
name we end up....) will be vanishing.
> Marcin, it seems you do not understand me at all.
Belevme I'm better at understanding english then writing it myself.
However alternatively my german is native grade and since you are from
the NL chances are good that we could settle on it better in priv OK?
Glaub mir bitte, mein passives english ist deutlich besser als das was ich
selbst schreibe, so dass unsere verstaendigungsprobleme wohl groesstenteils
darauf zurueck zu fuehren sein duerften. So ist zumindest mein eindruck.
(OK ein legastheniker bin ich in jeder sprache so oder so ;-).

Yeep I hope it will clarify some bits. (Since code doesn't bear all the
problems of interhuman communication semantics ;-).
