Another angle worth taking into account is that for any data that
is purely cached, (that is not currently pinned by a user), it is
possible to compact the data.  With rmap is property even applies to
pinned page cache pages.
For cases where internal fragmentation is likely it may be worth
taking advantage of this property.
