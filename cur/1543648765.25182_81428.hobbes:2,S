Actually, this is not an accurate description of LSM.  As you may know,
the LSM hooks do not have a noticeable performance impact (with the
exception of 1Gb networking, where I believe there is a 1-2% slowdown).
This has been pointed out several times before, and the LSM folks have
posted a pointer to the measurements.
