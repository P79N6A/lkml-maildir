Yes. Compare with PROT_GROWSDOWN and such.

I tested this patch. I didnt test all thinkable configurations of
flags though - what do you mean by "newflags shift and mask"?

We already have VM_DONTCOPY. Why would we need VM_MAYDONTCOPY and what
would it do?

Well, mmap would be much better off if VM_DONTCOPY is set atomically, since
a process may fork after mmap is called but before madvise.

I'm not opposed to this, on principle. But see below.

What about a new system call?
Or a flag for mprotect that effectively turns it into a new system call?
Something like PROT_EXTENDED?

Please note that the problem this attempts to solve is not limited
to pages locked by get_user_pages: in an infiniband userspace initiator,
a hardware page is mapped into process memory and must not be inherited
by a child processes, otherwise hardware protection breaks.

They dont hit it if they keep the mm semaphore, or if they only lock
pages for read.

The difficulty with changing get_user_pages, as I see it, is that
you wont be able to get away with a single DONTCOPY bit - you'll need
a full reference count for each page, no less.

Well, madvise currently cant break/merge VMAs, which is required
for VM_DONTCOPY. And it seems like making madvise do this opens
a whole cans of worms.
Hugh, so the patch is likely to be bigger in the madvise approach.
Considering this, and the fact that a full solution has to add
a flag to mmap, anyway, do you still think madvise is really the best way
to do it?
Regarding solving the problem automagically by get_user_pages:
What about a new VM_COPYONFORK flag, to trigger the old unix
behaviour of copying the vma on fork and a flag for get_user_pages that sets it?
Only users that dont keep the mm semaphore around
the get_user_pages/put_page operation would use this flag, others
would be unaffected. The flag will stay on until the VMA is destroyed.
