I assume there are drawbacks to such an option, since whatever method is used 
to "force" the control may make a mistake if similarly named controls are 
renamed.
Personally, I think the correct approach would be to have more sensible 
default values. Having the External Amplifier default off when it cripples 
analogue output on emu10k1, and has no effect on digital output, seems rather 
weird. Also, I never really understood the rationale for the "all zeros" 
mixer default. Why not 50%?
