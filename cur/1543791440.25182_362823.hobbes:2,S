I don't know when it's meant to reinit itself, but F8 does exit here,
and an immediate exit to boot up. The manual describes some RAID configs
need initialization in BIOS, but some (allegedly) initialize as the
OS loads. Then it contradicts itself and says RAID-5 is ready for
use w/o initialization. Whatever, it does nothing on boot, until a
mkfs, and then the world grinds very slowly.
