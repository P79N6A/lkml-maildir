I like that. How about the following. It will keep the buffer clean from
random chars, cause the kevent does not have the vector and relies on
the '\0' to separate the strings from each other.
I've tested it. The netlink-hotplug message looks like this:
recv(3, "remove@/class/input/mouse2\0ACTION=remove\0DEVPATH=/class/input/mouse2\0SUBSYSTEM=input\0SEQNUM=961                 \0", 1024, 0) = 113
