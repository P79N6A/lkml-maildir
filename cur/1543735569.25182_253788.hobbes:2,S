This is not (as far as I can tell) a raid1 bug.
   bio too big device md0
means that someone sent a request to md0 that was too large. (124K
instead of the max 100K).
raid1 never does that.  It send requests to the underlying devices.
So if you make your raid1 from hde and sda, then a message like
   bio to big device sda
might indicate a problem with raid1.
Are you sure you quoted the error message correctly?
If you, how was the array being used? What filesystem?
