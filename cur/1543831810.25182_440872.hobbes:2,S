Some people do, should they suffer? :-)

Not _all_, only nr_to_write of them:
			if (pages_written >= write_chunk)
				break;		/* We've done our duty */

Then why introduce more of them?
In current design each thread is responsible for write-out. This means
that write-out concurrency level scales together with the number of
writers. You propose to limit write-out concurrency by
MAX_PDFLUSH_THREADS. Obviously this is an artificial limit that will be
sub-optimal sometimes.
