errr ... belay that one.
a) I said I didn't get it in 2.4.3-ac3, which was only about 30% correct.
(I've gotten it 7 out of 9 times, since then).
and
b) it occured on a 2.4.2-ac28 tree without the aic7xxx driver update
(which shouldn'tve mattered anyway, in theory)
and
c) It happened right after webmin (don't ask!) started, and just for
giggles, I shut off webmin, rebooted, and -- no more problem.
*shrug*
