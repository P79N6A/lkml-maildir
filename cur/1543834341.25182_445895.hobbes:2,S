I just did it again, and the machine is >90% idle (PII/300), with 
mplayer doing:
ioctl(5, 0x806c4120, 0xbffeffd0)        = -1 ENODEV (No such device)
write(2, "alsa-lib: pcm_hw.c:406:(snd_pcm_"..., 89) = 89
write(2, "alsa-space: cannot get pcm statu"..., 50) = 50
nanosleep({0, 10000000}, NULL)          = 0
ioctl(5, 0x806c4120, 0xbffeffd0)        = -1 ENODEV (No such device)
about 70 times a second.
Of course, with other software, it may be different.
