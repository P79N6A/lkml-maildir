	I could not disagree with you more. If there really are life-safety issues,
the code *should* break badly (and should be designed to break badly) when
its dependency code is changed. And it should require someone familiar with
the life-safety issues to go in and fix it before it compiles again.
	Why would you prefer that someone with no familiarity with your life-safety
issues change the macros that your code uses -- causing code you wrote to
behave differently in ways the you did not intend and perhaps are not aware
of?
	You have two choices. You could stick with one kernel version, understand
it inside out, and be assured that it will continue to do what it has always
done. Or you can change kernel versions, but each time, you *WILL* have to
make sure that anything critical still works the way you think it worked.
	It is no easier to evaluate that an unchanged piece of code still works as
intended in a changed environment with changed header files than it is to
change a piece of code slightly to work as intended in a changed
environment.
