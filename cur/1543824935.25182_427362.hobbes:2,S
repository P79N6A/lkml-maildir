The only difference between AM2 and Socket 939/940 processors is DDR2
memory support.  So initializing the memory controller is a bit different,
but the BIOS does that before even looking for a boot loader, so Linux
shouldn't even notice the change.
The only place compatibility issues could show up is if you use the new
nForce5 chipset.  The built-in devices might work differently, or might
not be recognized, but I doubt nvidia did anything too severe; they
probably want generic Microsoft operating systems to work.
