The change doesn't affect the suspend. What it deals with is the resume
side. When the C600 resumes it doesn't always restore the keyboard/mouse
state.
The actual code it runs is pckbd_pm_resume() (pc_keyb.c) so you might want
to see if that is actually triggering and where it hangs during the resume
Its possible it broke across the merge due to other keyb changes
