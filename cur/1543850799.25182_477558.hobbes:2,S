Hum, interesting. But what happens if...
1. For example, the userspace app maps the fb (nopage is called, dirty
flag set, timer created), and then the app doesn't use the fb. The
timer will refresh the LCD, without anything new to refresh, so we are
wasting CPU time. After refreshing, the driver clears the dirty flag
and unmap the buffer.
2. After some seconds, the userspace app decides to write the buffer.
As it is not mmaped anymore, it will simply get a segmentation fault,
right? AFAIK nopage() is not called again because we have destroyed
the mmapping information, and Linux can't know what are the nopage()
ops to call to.
3. We mmap the device, timer is created, we start writing to the
buffer, the timer calls our refreshing function but we didn't finish
filling the buffer with our information: The LCD will have only some
of the screen.
And so on, am I right?
Thanks,
