Does the explain the NTFS problems I was looking into? I'd noticed that
try_to_free_pages didn't do anything with the icache and in my innocence^W
ignorance, assumed that shrink_dcache_memory did something about it (maybe
I thought inodes weren't cached without a dentry or something).

Out of curiosity, what was the reason behind not using the slab allocator?
I (think) I've noticed an interesting problem -- the slab allocator uses
page blocks of order > 0 for some caches, but get_free_pages only tries to
free single pages. As I can't think of a sane way to 'create' multi-page
blocks in gfp/try_to_free_page, maybe the slab allocator should reduce
the page block size it wants in low memory / fragmented memory situations.
Cheers,
Steve
