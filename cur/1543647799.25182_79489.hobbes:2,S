Hm, IMVHO I think this should be done correctly, as a subarch, instead
of just patches (although your patches are split up very nicely, good
job, that couldn't have been very easy.)  I don't know if "Time" is a
good excuse to put things like this in the tree, in the format that it
shouldn't be.
But as I'm not the i386 maintainer, I'll let Linus decide that one :)
