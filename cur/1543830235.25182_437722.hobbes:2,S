Close, but not quite, as you soon discover:

The first number is just the number of the USB bus.  That bus number is
simply incremented based on a new USB bus being created.  So, if you
load the USB controller drivers into the kernel in a different order,
you get different bus numbering.
I suggest going one step further up the device chain to the PCI device
itself.  Use the pci device number, as that is bit of a more stable
number (but be aware that it can change across reboots, and bios
upgrades have a tendancy to reorder things, and then there's the mess of
pci hotplug systems...)
Ideally, to solve this problem the best, you would just look at the
unique serial number in your usb-serial device, but unfortunatly, a lot
of them are not unique.  Is this the case for yours?
