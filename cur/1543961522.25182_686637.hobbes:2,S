2.6.25-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us
know.

From: Alan Stern <stern@rowland.harvard.edu>
commit: 0d22f65515307c878ddd20b1305cce925ca9516c
This patch (as1063) fixes a bug in the way ohci-hcd resumes its
controllers.  It leaves the Master Interrupt Enable bit turned off.
If the root hub is resumed immediately this won't matter.  But if the
root hub is suspended (say because no devices are plugged in), it won't
ever wake up by itself.
