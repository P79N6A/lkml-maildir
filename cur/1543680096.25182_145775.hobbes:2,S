Hi there,
Is there any chance of getting the CPUFreq patch rebased against
2.4.22-pre3 ?
I have been using the two patches linux-2.4.20-cpufreq.patch and
cpufreq-centrino.patch against 2.4.21-rc7-ac1 since June 12th without
any problems. From what I can tell, it is working very well indeed, so
if it could be included in -pre4 it'd be great.
Regards,
