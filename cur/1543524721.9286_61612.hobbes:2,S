Sort of. PPP Multilink can do multiple modem links if the ISP supports it.
If you want to work with a non helpful ISP then you can do limited load
balancing by simply routing some address ranges down each modem so that
requests tend to share. You won't get a single big ftp that way across both
however.
It might be simpler and cheaper just to move
