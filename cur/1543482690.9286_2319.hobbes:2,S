Thanks for the reply. I thought the buffering was done at the block level 
and that the ramdisk code worked by basically setting the BH_Protected 
flag of the provided buffer on a write request (to prevent it ever get 
freed up) and if it should get a read request simply return zeroes, 
because there is no real block device to read. So even if files get 
deleted, that still involves writes to the block device and surely 
freeing the buffer might me you lose vital data from the filesystem 
structure.
My simplistic understanding of this would lead me to believe that buffer 
management code might check the BH_Protected flag, but never clear it.
Regarding the swap issue, I am sure I tried this on a machine with a hard 
disk, but no swap. It was OK.
Any other comments from you or anyone else would be appreciated, I would 
much rather fix the problem than work around it.
