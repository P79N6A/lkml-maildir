  Actually I mean its reliance on files being deleted if the problem or
SIGTERM happened in the middle of build ing them.

  Don't adjust the system clock in the middle of the build. Adjusting
clock backward for more than a second is much more rare operation than a
shutdown.

  I have already said that programs don't use syscalls as the only atomic
operations on files -- yes, it may be a good idea to add transactions API
on the top of this (and it will have a lot of uses), but then it should be
made in a way that its use will be easy to add to existing applications.

  Any application that writes multiple times over the same files and has
any data consistency requirements beyond the piece of data in the chunk
sent in one write().
