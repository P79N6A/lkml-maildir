It seems to me that the driver does not re-enable interrupts or the
transmit and receive engines after it resets the adapter because of
the PCI bus error.
So, I would like to provide you with a patch which will log the state
of these registers after the adapter reset and during the transmit
timeout events to dmesg.  If you do not have the kernel source
available, I can try and compile the module for you (it will just take
a bit longer, as I will have to find the SuSE 9.2 source).
Thanks,
Jon
