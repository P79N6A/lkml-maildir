I'm confused.  The 2.2.19 time.c is already doing ">":
    /* VIA686a test code... reset the latch if count > max */
    if (count > LATCH-1) {
        [adjust count and whine]
The 2.2.20-pre2 patch doesn't change time.c, and I don't see
this code in 2.4.4 or 2.4.5pre.
Are you saying the code should be doing the equivalent of
"(count > LATCH)", or is 2.2.19 correct and the whines I'm
seeing mean there really is a problem with the Serverworks
chipset?
Thanks,
jcastle
