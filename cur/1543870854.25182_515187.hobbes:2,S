updatedb is the notorious one.
Alas, one can envisage sane workloads which really really really really
want to cache millions of dentries and inodes.  Workloads which get run
more often than once-per-day-at-4AM.  So if we "fix" updatedb, those
people with kernel-indistinguishable workloads get real unhappy.  We have
to pass instructions to the kernel to resolve this.
A sys_reclaim_dentry() would also need a sys_is_dentry_there() so updatedb
could restore the previous state.
Probably it'd be better to fix the well-known internal fragmentation problem
we have with the VFS caches.  That's fairly hard.

That'd be pretty simple, but a) would reclaim the pagecache for the
directory and not the dentry object itself and b) will only be easy to do
for ext2 and minixfs, which maintain a separate pagecache per directory.
Yes we could do a "nuke all the dentries in this directory thing", but
that's equivalent to sys_reclaim_dentry() in a loop.

yes, that's a disappointment.

Maybe the syscall auditing code can be persuaded to spit out records which
can be used for this.

That's a problem.  Nobody and everybody.
