   There are three common methods that bioses use for detecting
   memory:   0x88, which gives you 0->64mb (or 0->16mb, if you're
   a Compaq); 0xe801, which gives you 0->4gb, and 0xe820, which
   gives you a 64-bit wide address map.  Most every bios out there
   supports the first (but it's useless), lots of bioses from 4-5
   years ago supported the second, but a lot of modern bioses use
   the third (which is the method Microsoft prefers) and stub off
   the second.
   I'd be surprised if many bioses didn't support one of these
   three calls, and I'd be really surprised if many modern bioses
   didn't support e801 or e820.
