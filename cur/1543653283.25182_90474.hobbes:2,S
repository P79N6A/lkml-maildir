At the driver level, there should not be appreciable differences between 
the two chips.  8139C+ is the super-cool tulip-like chip from RealTek 
with all the speed and features.  8139D is just a small incremental 
revision of the chip.  It does add a few features, but none that would 
affect performance or stability (positively or negatively).
RealTek's 8139C+, and it's GigE cousin 8169 are really nice.  I hope 
RealTek finds a lot of customers for these chips, because so far they 
are both solid, fast, and feature-full.
