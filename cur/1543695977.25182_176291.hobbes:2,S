Subject: interrupts across  PCI bridge(s) not handled

I have a pci backplane extender, with 4 cards 
(named piraq) in it. The cards are detected by 
the PCI system, and irqs 92-95 are assigned, 
as shown in /var/log/messages:
kernel: PCI->APIC IRQ transform: (B6,I4,P0) -> 93 
kernel: PCI->APIC IRQ transform: (B6,I6,P0) -> 95 
kernel: PCI->APIC IRQ transform: (B6,I7,P0) -> 92
kernel: PCI->APIC IRQ transform: (B6,I9,P0) -> 94
My driver loads happily, with succesful registering 
of these interrupts. However, the interrupts don't 
get handled properly, and /proc/interrupts shows that 
they have not been correctly setup:

If I boot with "noapic", the interrupts do get 
assigned to XT-PIC, and will trigger correctly.
Same results are seen in 2.4.22 and 2.6.0-test9.
Thanks,
Charlie
N.B. System is Dell 650 w/ dual Xeons.
Backplane extender is a Magma. This scheme uses
a PCI interconnect card in both the Dell and 
the Magma, with a connecting cable.
