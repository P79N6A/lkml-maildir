This is a good point, but in the case where the real parent is tracing, won't
p->p_pptr == p->p_opptr anyway?
If the new field is going to be called 'Tracer', it should probably always
give a pid if the child is being traced.  So, the above line would turn into
something like
+	p->pid, p->p_opptr->pid, 
+       p->p_pptr != p->p_opptr && p->flags & (PF_PTRACED|PF_TRACESYS) ? p->p_pptr->pid : 0,
Alternatively, the new field would just be 'OriginalPPID' and always spit out
p->p_opptr->pid.  This would be a little less useful, though.
