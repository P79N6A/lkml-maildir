Generally it just complains that you pulled out the device prematurely, 
I've never seen one give a STOP error from that but I guess a bad driver 
or USB controller could cause anything.
When you insert a device like a USB stick Windows puts a little icon 
next to the clock in the system tray that you're supposed to use to stop 
the device before pulling it, effectively it unmounts and stops (or 
atleast releases the device from) the driver so the device can be 
'safely' removed. I also believe Windows mounts any removable device 
synchronously so that if you do pull it out prematurely the damage done 
is limited.
Jim.
