That's one bug I'd like to get fixed)

I had a shot at scripting this, but for me, everything works OK.
#!/bin/sh
dd if=/dev/zero of=file1 bs=1M count=32
dd if=/dev/zero of=file2 bs=1M count=32
yes | mkfs -t ext2 file1
yes | mkfs -t ext2 file2
mkdir -p mountpoint
mount -o loop file1 mountpoint
mkdir mountpoint/dir
umount mountpoint
mount -o loop,ro file1 mountpoint
mount -o loop file2 mountpoint/dir
mkdir -p $(/bin/pwd)/mountpoint/dir/subdir
are you able to modify the above so that it demonstrates the failure?
Thanks.
