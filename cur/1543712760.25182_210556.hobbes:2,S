2.6.4 and earlier are unpatchable, because they differ to much from 2.6.5.
Someone with a better connection than a tiny ISDN line should check the
ppc32-changes between 2.6.2-rc2 and 2.6.4, because 2.6.2-rc2 was the last
kernel I tried before 2.6.4 and 2.6.2-rc2 did at least boot.
2.6.5-rc2 and -rc3 don't behave any better after patching than before.
