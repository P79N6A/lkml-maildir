Hi.
	How can I prevent my Linux box to not flush out cached data?
My Linux box has a 512MB of memory. When I read a couple of large files
(small too) after some time not reading it anymore (3-6 hours) all cached
data are flushed out (no memory needed at this time).
How can I avoid it? It's really annoying 'coz when data are cached my data
base program works so fast, but when there're not, it's slow.
