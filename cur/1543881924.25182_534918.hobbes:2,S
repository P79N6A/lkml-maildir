This looks like Andi's sched_clock stuff hitting: it returns an
inherently per-cpu result, so using it for printk timestamps isn't very
useful.

This is a bit mysterious, in that it seems to be triggered by my
softlockup watchdog patch, which doesn't seem to have anything to do
with the locking tests at all.  Filed under "Ingo's mystery".

This also seems to be the sched_clock change; the WARN_ON is asserting
that it got initialized early enough, but it isn't.
