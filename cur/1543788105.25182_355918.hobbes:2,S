Anybody who tries to do this without at least understanding the design choices
made by AIX's SMIT tool deserves to re-invent it, poorly.

Amen to that - although the whole hotplug/udev/sysfs aggregation has at least
made a semi-sane way to find out from userspace what the kernel thinks is going on...
Are there any drivers out there that don't play nice with sysfs? If so, should

 ?
