Subject: [PATCH 1/2] fdtable: Bound minimum allocation size.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch modifies the fdtable minimum allocation unit, setting it to a fixed
size of 1024 bytes instead of basing it on the architecture page size. This
leaves the algorithm heuristics unchanged for the common 4K page size, but
does rebalance the "memory wasted versus number of reallocations" tradeoff for
architectures with larger page sizes (like 64K).
