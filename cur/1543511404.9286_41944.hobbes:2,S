I may give this a shot sometime this coming week, possibly modified as

Hrm; I do, however, have all scsi drives.  Where's that backup tape ...
Although I really like my Flashpoint, I do need to use this new mobo/cpu;
are there any other Mylex models you would recommend that don't have this
problem (no raid req.)?  Or any other brands?  *sigh*
