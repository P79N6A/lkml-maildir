Well, again, I took a very compilcated sequence of events and
minimized them to where they could be readily observed. The actual
problem in the production machine involves two absolutely independent
tasks that end up using the same shared 'C' runtime library. There
should be no interaction between them, none whatsover. However, when
they both execute rand(), they interact in bad ways. This interraction
occurs on random days at monthly intervals. To find this bug, I
had to compress that time. So, I allowed rand() to be "interrupted"
just as it would be in a context-switch. I simply used a signal
handler, knowing quite well that the "interrupt" could occur at
any time. Now, I didn't give a damn about the value returned in
either function invovation. What I brought to light was a SIGSEGV
that can occur when the shared-library rand() function is
"interrupted".  This is likely caused by the failure to use "-s"
in the compilation of a shared library function, fixed in subsequent
releases.
So don't pick on the code. It was designed to emphasize the
problem. It is not supposed to show how to write a signal
handler.
Cheers,
