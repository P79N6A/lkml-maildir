Subject: Annoying 2.4 -> 2.6 keycode change

I'd like to point out 
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1637
 (and my
earlier #1140 which got closed as "DOCUMENTED", but I have no idea what
documentation this refers to), which describes a behaviour
change from 2.4 to 2.6 on some European USB keyboards, where the key next to
enter (' and * on a finnish layout, \| on US) gets mapped to 84 by
hid-input.c, which is defined as Last_Console or SAK by just about all of
the keymaps in the kbd package. 
XFree86 was fine until 2.6.1-rc1 (with "2.4 compatibility fixes") after
which it started to handle the key as "Print Screen"
So, either the hid-input (and usbkbd?) mapping or most of the keyboard layouts of kbd and
XFree86 need to be fixed.
