This patch allows a the linux kernel to be debugged with gdb over a
serial line. There are other patches that allow similar functionality. The
advantage of this patch is that it allows gdb to begin communicating
with the kernel during the boot process. In this version, the kernel waits
for a connection from gdb over the serial port as soon as the IRQs have
been initialized. In the future I will try to make this connection point
even earlier in the boot process.
