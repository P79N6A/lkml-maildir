Hi Dave,
One of the main reasons for changing the core iops of the ata/ide driver
results from newer HBA's either supporting dual transports modes or in
some case exclusive MMIO, similar to current IOMIO x86 HBA's today.
Additionally, I suspect the current dual path for execution may end up
going N-ways.  As there are a few PATA hosts and in the future all SATA
hosts will convert to the FP-DMA (First Party DMA) messaging service
protocol.
This will then make (3) different execution transports.  The bad news is
during transition period (just now starting) it will become more painful
if we do not make the drive independent of iops regardless of arch/bus
issues.
One of the key ideas hottly debated between Ben, Jeff, and myself were the
impacts resulting from this change in direction.  Obviously Ben lives in a
world of MMIO and has suffered with a driver which was designed around
IOMIO.  Thus all the bastardized macros we all hate resulted from
x86-centric lameness (industry driven for the most part, yeah me included).
Now if we expand the issue into Jeff's world of the net-stack drivers, he
banged me over the head with the issue of "pci-posting delays".  Ben got
his shots in also about the issue, too.  Thus the resulting io_barrier
additions by Ben to the original ATA-driver transformation, can be extened
to the Net-Drivers.  Oh and the slope is increasing fast now.
So if it works for ATA and NET, could it not migrate to all hardware?
If it makes it to all hardware, should it not be coupled to the BUS?
If it is coupled to the BUS, are there going to be problems with
exceptions?
Well once I leave ATA (storage in general), I am not really able to
discuss those issues from a position of first hand experience.  So here is
my nickel spent.
Cheers,
