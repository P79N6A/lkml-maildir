you also might be sure you are doing a "make clean".  Once you compile
a non-smp kernel, and then switch to SMP, the "make" might not recompile
every source file.  ie do:
make oldconfig; make dep; make clean; make install
and see if you get errors.  If you do, reinstall the source as something
has gone wrong...
