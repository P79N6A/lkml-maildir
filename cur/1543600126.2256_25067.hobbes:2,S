             Ashes on my head guys...
    Gotta wrong results in my previous perftest... (slightly different 
  environments), so these are to be sure that on low VM load there isnt
  any significant difference...
  Here are new and revisited. Actually i maked sure that the environments
differs only in kernels...
  Bonus: two bugs! :)
   1. Quintela`s (shmtest of memtest) and pmap{2,3} == 100% instant deadlock
      plain ac12 demonstrates ignorance.
   2. Swapoff oops 100% - only in pmap3! (okay, swapoff of reiserfs 
      to be strict, but i think that doesnt actually matters)
      swapoff oops will be in next mail.
  Revisited results:
time find / -xdev - done 5 times

* fillmem == (fillmem of memtest)
* dont count on differences - they are quite flaky, one is only known:
  there are no much difference anyways...
time fillmem - done 7 times, still giving strange results sometimes...
