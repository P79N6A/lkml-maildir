Hi,
    I just wanted to make sure that I can add more than 8 swap
partitions under 2.2.8 by only changing the MAX_SWAPFILES #define in
include/linux/swap.h.  I have a configuration here that would benefit
greatly from being able to use all 18 swap partitions it has available.
Let's just say that I'm doing some high-end benchmarking before you say
that I should just grow my swap partitions.  What is the maximum limit?
I only see this used for allocating an array, so I think it's doable,
but I don't really want to find out the hard way and having to fsck 30
or so disks...  Thanks!
 - Pete
