The problem being: you have no way to tell when method returns. IOW,
there's nothing for revoke() to sleep on.
#2 is essentially the same as #1, but with an additional twist: call of
old method may happen after the new value of ->f_op is written to memory.
Some exclusion is obviously needed here. In principle, rw-semaphore with
all methods callers holding it for read and revoke() holding it for write
would be enough, but I suspect that overhead will be nasty. Something like
rw-semaphore with extremely light-weight readers and potentially slow
writer might be OK, but AFAICS there is nothing of that sort in the
tree. We have such spinlocks, but I don't see how to apply that idea to
semaphores. Besides, it ought to be small - every struct file will have to
contain such beast.
