Can't you just build a restart preloader which intercepts system calls
and translates pids?  Wouldn't this keep the kernel simpler and only
affect those applications that are being restarted?  Christoph, I
added you since you seem to tirelessly promote using preloaders to
work around this type of issue.  Is it possible?
Thanks,
