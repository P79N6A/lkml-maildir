ideally you merge the patch into your queue and send it (via gregkh) on
its way to the final kernel.org merge.
This queue isn't meant to be "this is all going direct to linus
bypassing everyone"; we're trying to get as much as possible sent via
the maintainers. So if you as maintainer want to pick up a patch, we're
very happy about that!
