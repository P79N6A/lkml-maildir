Hello,
I tried the ide-tape driver for several weeks now. And after some time during
writing or reading tar stops because of errors.
Error messages are:
Nov 30 15:32:20  kernel: ide-tape: ht0: I/O error, pc =  8, key =  0,
asc =  0, ascq =  2 Nov 30 15:32:25 eckhard last message repeated 1000 times
Nov 30 15:32:25  kernel: ide-tape: ht0: unrecovered read error on logical block number 461706, skipping
Nov 30 15:32:25  kernel: ide-tape: ht0: I/O error, pc =  8, key =  0, asc =  0, ascq =  2
Nov 30 15:32:31  last message repeated 1000 times
Nov 30 15:32:31  kernel: ide-tape: ht0: unrecovered read error on logical block number 461707, skipping
Nov 30 15:32:31  kernel: ide-tape: ht0: I/O error, pc =  8, key =  0, asc =  0, ascq =  2 
I tried to switch of pipelining by setting the parameters in ide-tape.c to 0
but it didn't help too much ( the error seems to raise later :-(
This happens with 2.2.14, 2.2.17 and 2.4.test11 on SuSE-Linux6.4.
I would really like to help finding the reason for this despite it takes a lot
of time to fill a complete tape with tar. 
Please - what's going on there?
