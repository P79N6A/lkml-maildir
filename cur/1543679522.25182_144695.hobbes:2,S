Correct.

You will hit priority inversion... not with spinlocks but with
semaphores (and possibly more subtle issues).
The only safe way to do this safely is to boost the task's priority out
of the "idle" class when the task is inside the kernel.
It is nontrivial to juggle user vs. kernel returns such as that. Google
for Ingo Molnar's SCHED_BATCH addition to the O(1) scheduler.
