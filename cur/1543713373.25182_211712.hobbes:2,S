uname -a reports "2.4.22-1-386", although I suppose it's been patched
by the debian-installer team.  After hardware detection has run and
worked (as in, no hangs), sis5513 does indeed appear in lsmod, and
"dmesg | grep -i dma" tells me hda and hdc do use DMA.

  I couldn't find out how to do that.  I tried booting with a long
"linux nodma hda=nodma hdc=nodma ide=nodma idebus=nodma" command-line,
but that didn't seem to change much.  I also tried disabling
everything that looked like DMA in the BIOS setup, to no avail.  dmesg
still tells me the kernel uses DMA (or maybe I don't understand what
dmesg tells me, which is of course entirely possible).
