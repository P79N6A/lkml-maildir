Not so sure I agree ... recompiled the kernel with debugging output in
module.c and when I try to insert mii.o without above patch it complains
"Module has no name!" and returns -ENOEXEC from the syscall. I think
naming mii.o would be a good idea. This may not be the best way to do
it, but it works. (Granted, I'm not terribly familiar with all the
modules code changes yet, but ... ) Having anonymous output in lsmod
would be somewhat confusing :) ("Well, whatever it is, 8139too needs
it, don't touch it!")
Just noticed above patch is -p0. Whoops.
