I presume it was getting the 'fuser ...' crash,
since Eric was using the same command I was using.
I need to run Eric's fix with my SGI inhouse
application that I first saw this on, to be sure
it's happy too.
I'm optimistic that will work too.  Hopefully
I can get to this sometime this evening.
The gregkh/sysfs/... boot failure is a separate
bug, as I trust you are aware from your responses
on that failure.
