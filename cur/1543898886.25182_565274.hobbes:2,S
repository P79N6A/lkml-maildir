AFAIR it is plain luck that serial console sometimes works.
I repeat: "no bugreport" is not the same as "it works for everyone" wrt.
suspend. It seems (i unfortunately have no numbers, since my machines always
worked without suspending the consoles) as if suspending consoles generally
helped reliability of suspend.

So should we remove sysrq-C?
This is a debugging option. Only root can set it. Its purpose is to make
"machine hangs during suspend" (even before it goes to sleep) debuggable.
It will only be set if the machine crashes anyways.
(We can taint the kernel if this control is set, if that helps you).
