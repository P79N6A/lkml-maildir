Could it be related to the video on the sc1200 being emulated by SMI (at
least as far as I understand things)?  Perhaps the acceleration simply
makes the BIOS/SMI stuff go do all the work, while with no acceleration,
the kernel writes all the bits directly, which is more efficient than
the BIOS/SMI emulation?  I think that is how the VSA stuff works on
those systems at least.  I have VGA disabled on the boards I use here,
so all I know is that the video is very slow on these systems when I
tried it once, and since I don't have a use for it, I disabled it.
