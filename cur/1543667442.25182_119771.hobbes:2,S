Yeah, I think it happens on the whole, despite the conflict of interest;
but frustratingly slowly. There's two sides to that equation though.

Right. I just think mainline should provide that facilitation role. 
If it doesn't, then if someone can gather the patches together, it'd
help a lot. Applying the patches less of a problem than finding out what
to apply ... following LKML isn't feasible for most people.

yeah, but it's more like "should we have someone list the service defects
together on a website where you can find them easily", or leave them in 
a darkened basment where the lights are out with "beware of the leapord"
stuck on the door ;-) Or should I have to service my car at the dealer?
Some people may chose the dealer ... I'd prefer the website to the 
basement ;-)

Not a lot ;-)
