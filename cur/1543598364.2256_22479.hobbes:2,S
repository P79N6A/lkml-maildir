This is *not* the same problem.  The original poster can't get his 
system booted at all (and that includes the fact that it won't even find 
all the drives and read partition tables or anything like that).  Your 
system is getting much further along.  Absolutely 0 progress is *vastly* 
different from progress mixed with some errors.
