The number of cylinders is meaningless.  What matters is the number of 
sectors.  What does "fdisk -l /dev/sdX" (substitute the appropriate 
letter for X) display for the pendrive on each of the machines?
What messages show up in the dmesg log when you plug in the pendrive?
What version of the Linux kernel are you using?
