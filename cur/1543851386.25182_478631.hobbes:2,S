You're right. In my defense, that stuff arrived the day I went
on vacation for two weeks, and I subsequently forgot all about it.
Looking back over that thread though, a few people seemed to pick a
number of holes in the patches, and there are some real gems in that
thread like.

Which is just great, as afair, the cpufreq locks were there _before_
someone liberally sprinkled lock_cpu_hotplug() everywhere.

From what I can tell from looking at that thread back in August,
it went on for a while with a number of people picking holes in the
proposed patches, but there wasn't any reposted after that, and
certainly nothing that ended up in -mm.
_something_ needs to be done. If someone wants to fix it, great, but
until we see something mergable, we're left in this half-assed state
which is freaking people out.
