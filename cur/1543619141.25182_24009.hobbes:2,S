oh .. .there are some differences between the registers in the chipsets
... the kt 133 and the kt133 are very simmilar, the kx133 also ... the
kt266 and 266a are a bit different from the kt/kx ....
i uped the pcr files for the kt133 and kx133 also
so the urls for the three files:
http://cip.uni-trier.de/nofftz/linux/kt266_pcr.txt
				     kt133_pcr.txt
				     kx133_pcr.txt
this are all i have at the moment ...
