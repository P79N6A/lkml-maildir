	Hi,
	I tried 2.5.64-bk9, and it doesn't work !
	You simply forgot to apply the patch I sent you at the
very beggining of this discussion :
----------------------------------------------------
diff -u -p linux/drivers/base/platform.c.original linux/drivers/base/platform.c
--- linux/drivers/base/platform.c.original      Fri Mar 14 17:47:16 2003
+++ linux/drivers/base/platform.c       Fri Mar 14 17:47:40 2003
@@ -75,5 +75,6 @@ int __init platform_bus_init(void)
        return bus_register(&platform_bus_type);
 }
 
+EXPORT_SYMBOL(platform_bus_type);
 EXPORT_SYMBOL(platform_device_register);
 EXPORT_SYMBOL(platform_device_unregister);
----------------------------------------------------
	On the other hand, with the above patch, now everything is
working properly and my Pcmcia card work wonderfully.
	Thanks a lot for the great work, and have fun...
	Jean
