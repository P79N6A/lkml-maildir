No, you were right it was definitely a NON trivial error.

As a long time user of Kalman filters I tend to think of them as the 
same thing.  I use the term running average when talking about the idea 
behind a scheduler because I think that more people will understand what 
the general idea is.  When it comes to implementation I always replace 
the idea of "running average" with a roughly equivalent Kalman filter.

Yes.  I think that we can fiddle fairly freely with these (subject to 
the fact that they currently cache part of the load balancer's average 
load calculation's need to multiply by SCHED_LOAD_SCALE in their value). 
  From the POV of the smpnice of the load balancer it just wants the 
values to reflect the system's interpretation of nice.  This used to be 
done by tying the values to the time slice allocations associated with 
nice but that is now history so we're free to redesign it.  As you say, 
having the ability to easily try different mappings would make it easier 
to experiment and find the best mapping.

I agree with that approach.  There's no sense spending too much effort 
being extremely precise when the input you use is probably invalid by 
the time you apply the output.

Unfortunately not.  Things like sleep and wait time need to be real time 
and only "on CPU" time needs to be "equivalent full speed on CPU time" 
in metrics. With a conversion back the other way when used to work out 
expected "on CPU" time.

I think the one shot timer is dangerous as it can possibly lead to 
infinite pre-emption loops if several tasks end up with the same "on 
CPU" and the periodic interrupt is therefore better.  Like you I feel 
sad about this as I hoped that scheduler_tick() would disappear.

Arguably the latest one should go first as its estimate is more likely 
to be correct being based on more recent info i.e. the other's estimates 
would be based on less runnable tasks and be optimistic. This would 
involve pushing them down the queue and pushing items already on the 
queue downwards is likely to be expensive.  Which is why I prefer the 
less elegant solution of the periodical interrupt.
Of course, one solution might be to just add the adjustment to the key 
time on all tasks on the queue?
