Main strain on Michael's box comes from the thing *using* AF_UNIX. I've
looked through the oops list he had sent to me - almost everything came
from the stomped vma, two were caused by bogus kfree() (from sk_clone()),
one from find_buffer(). Something stomps on core - all those places are
doing scanning long lists and break at the first sign of memory corruption
(of any sort - software and hardware ones are equivalent here).
