Most modern hardware doesn't have APM support any more. Tracking these
bugs down is important, otherwise we'll never be able to support
anything that people can actually buy.
For what it's worth, ACPI suspend/resume seems to work on most machines
as of 2.6.9 - the major sticking point is restoring video state, and the
small number of pieces of hardware that still have basic suspend/resume
issues (a lot of VIA-based hardware, at least one HP device). Based on
my tests so far, around 70% of machines ought to have a semi-reasonable
chance of working ACPI S3 nowadays.
