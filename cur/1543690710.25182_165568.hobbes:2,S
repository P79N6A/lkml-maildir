I stopped writing about this question a lot of time ago.
However, here we are.
If you modify the page tables as in my example (and then if you do so only
for B's pagetable)
you can be sure the things you're modifying were not present in Firmware
TLBs, not yet.
Because those pagetable entries refer to a logical address interval
you've just allocated in B address space.
Bye,
