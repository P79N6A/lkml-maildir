I think you're way too stuck on the 32MB number.  Other limitations 
already limit that further.
If and when the upper layers pass down such requests, my driver can 
handle that.  For today, various external limitations and factors -- 
such as what you describe above -- mean the driver won't be getting 
anywhere near 32MB requests.  And my driver can handle that just fine too.
