I remain concerned that it hasn't been demonstrated that the infrastructure
which this patch provides will be adequate for all future applications -
especially memory hot-remove.
So I'll queue this up for -mm, but I think we need to see an entire
hot-remove implementation based on this, and have all the interested
parties signed up to it before we can start moving the infrastructure into
mainline.
Do you think the features which these patches add should be Kconfigurable?
