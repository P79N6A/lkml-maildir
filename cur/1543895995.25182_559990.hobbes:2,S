Cattle excreta.  The kernel remains as it presently is.  No less useful that it is
now.

Userspace has just as much info as the kernel has and there is no latency
concern here.

Because userspace can implement more sophisticated algorithms and is more
easily configured.
For example, userspace can take a hotplug event for the just-added
usb-storage device then go look up its IO characteristics in a database
and then apply that to the confgured policy.  If the device was not found,
userspace can perform a test run to empirically measure that device's IO
characteristics and then record them in the database.  I don't think we'll
be doing this in-kernel any time soon.
(And to preempt lkml-games: this is just an _example_.  There are
others)

So libtune is the only possible way of implementing any of this?
If choosing the optimum settings cannot be done in userspace then it sure
as heck cannot be done in-kernel.
Anyway, this is all arse-about.  What is the design?  What algorithms
do we need to implement to do this successfully?  Answer me that, then
we can decide upon these implementation details.
