My apologies.  What should be blamed was the bad partial dump
implementation and not the partial dump itself.
But I don't think data pages of user processes are almost always
useless, as Ted comments.

I agree.
When a system crashed, a user may want to _avoid_ the cause of
crash and continue operation, until bugs are fixed and well
tested.
Then we try to find the way to avoid the specific situation that
has caused the crash.  Sometimes it can be done by changing
resource limits, timeouts, or some fancy features in XXX.conf of
user programs.
To investigate the behavior of user processes, having data pages
of user processes in a dump is mandatory.
