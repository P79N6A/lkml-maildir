I've met Victor several times including having discussions over open
source philosophy patents and the like. I think he is a good guy. The
patent grant says it can be used for GPL software. As a free software
author I have no problems at all with Victor's patent. If I want to do
proprietary software well shucks, I'm going to have to play by the
proprietary rules. I don't see that anti free software. It might be anti
how convenient I can mix the two and flog it for lots of money, but
thats not free software anyway.

He told them that if they were not sure they should ask a lawyer. That
sounds to me rather correct advice. What kind of answer do you expect.
There are really only two that might be expected in such a situation,
they I suspect go
	"We think you need a license if you use proprietary software 
	 with this" and "Ask a lawyer"
Given the first answer RTAI from their whining on this list would take
the second answer anyway.
