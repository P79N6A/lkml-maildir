Hi,
I'm trying ALSA on linux 2.5.70, it works fine but... when I try to unload
module "snd" the kernel freeze without any message.
Interrupts are enabled (I try this with the keyboard's leds :-), then I can't 
do anything but press the reset button.
I'm using module-init-tools 0.9.12 and my config is:
#
# Loadable module support
#
CONFIG_MODULES=y
CONFIG_MODULE_UNLOAD=y
CONFIG_MODULE_FORCE_UNLOAD=y
