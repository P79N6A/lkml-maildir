Are you able to reproduce the same behavior with kernel 2.4.24 and
lm-sensors 2.8.2?

Could you provide a few outputs of "i2cdump 0 0x2d"? I wonder if this
will show read errors (as "XX") or simply changing values.
Does your BIOS provide a feature such as "Circle Of Protection" or
anything that sounds like "active" hardware monitoring? Is it enabled?
If you have any other chips (eeproms for example) on the bus, do you
observe similar behavior with these?

Which motherboard is it?
Did you have to enable any particular option in MBM?

Bad brakes?
Just kidding... ;)
