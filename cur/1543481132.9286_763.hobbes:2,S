I was asked by Alan Cox to reverse to the original code prior to 2.1.122.
I thought that auto-setting was the correct method based on some code
loaned to me from a vender.  This patch will allow for a config option.
Since some drives are fussy about having this value set either to ZERO or
MAX and most are DGD (Don't Give a Darn), this will allow folks to pick
and choose.
