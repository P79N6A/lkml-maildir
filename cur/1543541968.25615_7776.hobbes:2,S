I'd wager most people on this list do not have broadband access to the
internet.  Downloading large attachments takes time and in some cases
(especially for people outside the US) money.  The normal traffic on
this list is large enough already without large attachments.  If someone
is interested enough in a patch they will download it from a URL.
