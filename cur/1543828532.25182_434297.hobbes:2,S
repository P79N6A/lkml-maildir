Subject: [1/4] ACPI C-States: accounting of sleep states
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/19/359

Track the actual time spent in C-States (C2 upwards, we can't
determine this for C1), not only the number of invocations. This is
especially useful for dynamic ticks / "tickless systems", but is also
of interest on normal systems, as any interrupt activity leads to
C-States being exited, not only the timer interrupt.
The time is being measured in PM timer ticks, so an increase by one equals
279 nanoseconds.
