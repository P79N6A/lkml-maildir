Hello,
When I try to load module ttime.o - "insmod ttime.o" - I get the
following message: "ttime.o: init_module: Device or resource busy".
"lsmod" shows that ttime.o was effectively not loaded. I am using RH7
with kernel 2.2.16-22. Does anyone have a guess on a possible reason for
this and how to fix it, so the module can be normally loaded ?
Thanks,
Marcus.
