True. You could just wrap it up in inline functions and hide it in a header
file as I suggested in the email I've just sent.

Alternately, you could just have do_page_fault() do:
	while (!down_read_trylock(&current->mm->mmap_sem))
		continue;
However, note that this can suffer from starvation due to a never ending flow
of mixed write-locks and read-locks on other CPUs. Unlikely, true, but not
impossible.
There is yet another way, now that I think about it... Another rwsem could be
added to mm_struct, one that you have to get immediately before mmap_sem and
release immediately after; one that page fault doesn't ever touch... but that
isn't very pleasant either:-/
A yet further way would be to make a second kind of rwsem; one that's
unfair. But if you do that, a few threads that're swapping a lot, combined
with a few tops could starve out another thread that's trying to do an mmap...
Actually, there's an added benefit to your suggested method... It doesn't
involve changing what's in task_struct or mm_struct and doesn't involve
changing the semantics of the mmap_sem lock.

rwsems themselves? No, not really. It'd either mean keeing track of which task
holds what sort of lock on every rwsem (which'd be nice for debugging,
granted; but not something you really want in a normal system), or it'd mean
making rwsems unfair - something I think will be a really bad idea.
