Hi,
I have a Tyan Thunder K7x Pro (S2469) and the amd-k7-agp module does not
seem to be probing my AGP device.  I have even tried putting debugging
code into the amd-k7-agp module, and sure enough I can see it being
loaded, but the probe function is never called.  This is with kernel 2.6.19.
Here is my lspci -vvv for the relevent devices:

As you can see, the first device is indeed showing up as AGP capable and
such, its just never probed (at least the probe function in amd-k7-agp
is never called once the module is loaded).
To simplefy things, here is a pcitweak -l of the top two devices above:
PCI: 00:00:0: chip 1022,700c card 0000,0000 rev 20 class 06,00,00 hdr 00
PCI: 00:01:0: chip 1022,700d card 0000,0000 rev 00 class 06,04,00 hdr 01
In the amd-k7-agp code, this is in the device list:
    {
    .class      = (PCI_CLASS_BRIDGE_HOST << 8),
    .class_mask = ~0,
    .vendor     = PCI_VENDOR_ID_AMD,
    .device     = PCI_DEVICE_ID_AMD_FE_GATE_700C,
    .subvendor  = PCI_ANY_ID,
    .subdevice  = PCI_ANY_ID,
    },
Which matches the first device.  So I'm completely unsure as to why this
device is never probed or how to fix it.
Any help appreciated,
PreZ :)
PS - please CC me specifically on replies.  I will check the list myself
manually, but just in case I miss something .. :)
