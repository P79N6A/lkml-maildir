Try it a bunch of times and it will vary by more than that percentage.
Let us assume that all is identical.........bad assumption....
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  3.03 seconds =42.24 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in 11.16 seconds = 5.73 MB/sec
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  3.08 seconds =41.56 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  4.55 seconds =14.07 MB/sec
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  3.00 seconds =42.67 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  4.61 seconds =13.88 MB/sec
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  3.01 seconds =42.52 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  5.38 seconds =11.90 MB/sec
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  3.48 seconds =36.78 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  4.35 seconds =14.71 MB/sec
/dev/hda:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  3.48 seconds =36.78 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  4.33 seconds =14.78 MB/sec
As you can see that it rides a wave based on activity of stuff running.

36.78/42.24 varies by 1/7th of max buffer-cache reads.
Oh well............
