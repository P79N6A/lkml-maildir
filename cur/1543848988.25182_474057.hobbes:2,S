Perhaps.
The somewhat related problems, in my book, are:
 1) I don't know how to tell what sched domains/groups a system has, nor
    how to tell my customers how to see what sched domains they have, and
 2) I suspect that Mr. Cpusets doesn't understand sched domains and that
    Mr. Sched Domain doesn't understand cpusets, and that we've ended
    up with some inscrutable and likely unsuitable interactions between
    the two as a result, which in particular don't result in cpusets
    driving the sched domain configuration in the desired ways for some
    of the less trivial configs.
    Well ... at least the first suspcicion above is a near certainty ;).
