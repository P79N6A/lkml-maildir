Duh, I missed the call to try_module_get,  probably because it's right
below the 'if (mod && mod->state == MODULE_STATE_COMING) return 0;' :-)
in strong_try_module_get (2.6.13-rc1)
mod->state is MODULE_STATE_COMING until after mod->init returns and since
you are calling __symbol_get indirectly from the modules init routine,
bammo.

I think any symbol_get is problematic given the above. I was thinking
you could wrap mod_reg_security but it would still need to be called from
within the modules init fn.
I'm going to have to give it some thought, but a new rmmod hook does seem
a good solution off the top of my head.
