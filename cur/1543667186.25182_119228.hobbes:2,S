Are you still considering smalldevfs for 2.6 inclusion? If not, then I'd like to 
discuss with you (and Greg KH) the possibility of just eliminating devfs 
entirely, and moving to a userspace version that is driven entirely by 
/sbin/hotplug.
There are already adequate hotplug events generated in 2.5.65+ to create and 
remove all necessary /dev entries, other than /dev/console (and that gets 
created by the initramfs being unpacked). If the devfs concept of "devfs_only" 
(no major/minor access to device drivers) is truly gone (as it appears to be), 
then the userspace variant of devfs would be quite simple: process the hotplug 
event and read the appropriate information out of sysfs to get the dev_t for the 
device, then follow user-specified policies to create /dev entries.
Unless I'm missing something obvious, "devfs" could be just a synonym for a 
specific tmpfs instance, with no built-in behavior at all. At initramfs unpack 
time it would be mounted on /dev, /dev/console would be created, and then 
/sbin/hotplug would create/remove entries as the drivers to their thing.
When the real root filesystem gets mounted, devfs could then be mounted again on 
the new /dev (just like devfs now) and everything's running smoothly.
