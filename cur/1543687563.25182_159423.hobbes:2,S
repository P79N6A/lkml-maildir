Well I made it so that if full timeslice is used, and then the same task is 
next==prev, let next candidate for scheduling get up to TIMESLICE_GRANULARITY 
timeslice; not a full task timeslice. Even this was palpable as losing the X 
waving around smoothness with anything else burning (kernel compile, bunzip or 
whatever). Basically X is somewhere between a frequent sleeper with short 
periods of cpu time, or a burst of full timeslices when used heavily. When it's 
full timeslices, it suffers under the same things that throttle spinners.

I was letting it run out the full timeslice unabated, and only preventing it 
from getting immediately rescheduled.

Ok I think blender (we say blenndah in .au) is waking up, polling for X, then 
going back to sleep only to do it all over again. I don't think it's wasting a 
full timeslice at all. There seem to be two variants of this spin on wait; one 
is the task that uses a full timeslice spinning (wine games), and the other is 
waking up, rescheduling and going back to sleep only to do it all over again.

But how did this mutt perform?

+ another 2'6"" doesn't quite get us tall enough. Maybe we need another 
munchkin.
