Does the "if" clause exist? If not, then by distributing the original 
software, the distributor is agreeing to abide by the GPL terms for anything 
linking with it. If the linking code is not GPL-compatible, the distributor 
cannot legally distribute the GPL'd component.

They might have a legal loophole if dynamic linking doesn't constitute a 
derivative work *and* nVidia doesn't distribute Linux (thus does not need to 
agree to GPL terms).
