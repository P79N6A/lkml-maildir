Hmm, don't we already have all that __setup() stuff laying around?  Ok,
it might not be built into the .o for modules, but it could be.  Could
we not do something along the lines of:
1. User passes parameters on the kernel command line.
2. modprobe reads the kernel command line and sorts out those that
   correspond to the __setup() stuff in the module being loaded.
3. modprobe combines in any extra settings from /etc/modules.conf
IIRC, this would satisfy the original posters intentions, presumably
without too much hastle?
