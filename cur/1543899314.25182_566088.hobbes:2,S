Do you have some specific bug numbers? Other than this one:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8421
That one is hotplug-related, and it would seem only affects specific 
boards as it works fine for me. Likely NVIDIA input would be needed on 
that one to get much farther.
I didn't find any other sata_nv ADMA-related bugs in the kernel.org or 
RH Bugzillas.
Most of the reports I've gotten recently have been in one of these 
categories:
-broken NCQ implementation on the drive (usually shows up as commands 
timing out with CPB resp_flags of 2)
-cabling or power problems (often showing errors in the SError register)
There have been a few reports yet of problems with commands getting 
issued and seeing to go nowhere. These can be difficult to diagnose. 
However, in some cases there's evidence leaning toward this being a 
drive issue as well, ex: this thread:
http://groups.google.ca/group/linux.kernel/browse_frm/thread/2ebf329e3f6470eb/0d26dff9a30d29e9?lnk=gst
Here there's a report of this drive model doing this on multiple 
controllers.
Keep in mind, in the case where a broken NCQ implementation on the drive 
is the cause, disabling ADMA (and hence NCQ) will appear to "fix" the 
problem when the proper course of action would be to blacklist NCQ on 
that drive globally.
Given the relative scarcity of problem reports (at least those I've 
seen), and the fact that this is not obscure hardware (they must have 
made millions of these nForce4 boards, and I think some may even still 
be in production), I'm reluctant to say we should be switching ADMA off 
by default.

Yes, they're independent.
