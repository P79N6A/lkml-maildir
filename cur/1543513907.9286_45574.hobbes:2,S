  Hello.
  So I've ported fixes from 2.2 to 2.3. As nobody seems to be complaining I think
I haven't made any fatal mistake. Linus please apply this stuff.

Major fixes:
Fixed a lot of races in dquot_transfer(), dqget(), sync_dquots().
invalidate_dquots() walks through inodes, not filps (functions moved to inode.c;
we also do scan cleverer than in 2.2 - build list of dquots whose dqput() will block
and than free them in the end).
Serialized quota_on() and quota_off().
Fixed deadlock in write_dquot().
Patch is available at
