I have some experimental IDE based code which can detect the PCI bus
speed by doing some IDE transfers and measuring the time it takes. It
isn't 100% reliable, though. I haven't found any other way to detect PCI
clock reliably, unfortunately it cannot be safely guessed from the CPU
clock or FSB clock or anything.
