I believe sorting AND merging were turned off.  BTW, this was 2.4 only,
our primary focus is getting product into people's hands this year.  We
are hoping to play with the 2.5 IO scheduler, possibly in a few months.

A lot more interrupts on the RAID device, indicating a lot more
IOs, probably a direct result of disabling merging.  Overall IO throughput
dropped pretty dramatically, reducing database throughput.
A good indication to gen a patch with just sorting turned off and
see where that gets us...
