Subject: [Patch 6/8] 2.4: Fix jbd assert failure on IO error.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The buffer_uptodate flag gets cleared on IO failure, and this can panic
jbd when it tries to write such a buffer.  Relax the panic to be just a
warning.
