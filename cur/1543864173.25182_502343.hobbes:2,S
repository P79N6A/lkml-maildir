I'm not sure that does what you think it does, the sync runs first, and 
data is still in the cache. Replace sync with "/bin/echo RAN" if you 
doubt me.
What you want is this:
   sync;
   time bash -c "dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/1GB bs=1M count=1024; sync"
which will actually time the write with the time command.
