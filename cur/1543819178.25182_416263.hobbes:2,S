It's not bad, but it seems to allow cpu-hogs to steal left-over timeslices, 
which increases unfairness as the proc load increases.  Conditionalizing 
prio-boosting based on hogginess maybe one way to compensate for this.  This 
would involve resisting any prio-change unless hogged, which should be 
scaled by hogginess, something like SleepAVG but much simpler and less 
fluctuating.
Really, the key to a successful scheduler would be to build it step by step 
by way of abstraction, modularization, and extension.  Starting w/ a 
noop/RR-scheduler, each step would need to be analyzed for stability and 
efficiency, before moving to the next step, thus exposing problems as you 
move from step to step.
Thanks!
