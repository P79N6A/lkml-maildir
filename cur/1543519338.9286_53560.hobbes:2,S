Oh yes, of course.  Take a look at
<URL:
http://www.cyberelk.demon.co.uk/parport/deviceid-0.1.tar.gz>.
  It
uses the new ppdev stuff, so you need to make the relevant character
special devices (major 99).
Although deviceid just hooks into the kernel, it's still possible that it
will pick up the device ID where the kernel failed.  Anyhow, it will be
easier to debug where it's failing.
