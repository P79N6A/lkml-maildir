No, it doesn't complain, that's the point. According to nm(1):
       For each symbol, nm shows:
          The symbol value, in the  radix  selected  by  options
           (see below), or hexadecimal by default.
          The  symbol  type.   At  least the following types are
           used; others are, as well,  depending  on  the  object
           file  format.   If  lowercase, the symbol is local; if
           uppercase, the symbol is global (external).
Symbols in a source file that are static are tagged with a 't' as well.
Read System.map for more proof of this.
The patch is fine, especially since I think it's based on something I've
posted in the past. :) The one thing I'd always done differently, though,
was to prefix the labels with '.', since I thought that was what kept it
local. But, after I RTFM'd, I find that's not even necessary.
