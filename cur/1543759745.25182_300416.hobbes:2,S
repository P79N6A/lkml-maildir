Hi there.
I noticed that the ALPS driver was added to 2.6.11, a thing that alot of 
people probably like, but since my touchpad (Acer Aspire 1300XV) worked 
perfectly before (like, 2.6.10) and now the ALPS driver disables 
'hardware tapping', wich makes it hard to tap. I commented out the 
disable-tapping bits in alps.c and now it's working like a charm again.
Maybe the hardware tapping-thing should be configurable via some boot or 
config option?
