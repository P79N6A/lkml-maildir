The effect is the exact same as mine (if there is a mismatch
then generic HDLC support for synclink is silently disabled),
and your patch is against a patch that has already been dropped.
The only difference is the granularity of enabling
the HDLC option for individual synclink adapter types,
which is not really an issue (as this is not in <= 2.6.16 anyways).
I'd prefer to stick with my patch as it is simpler,
and maintains compatibility with the way thing are done
in <= 2.6.16 (customer documentation does not need updating).
Thanks,
Paul
