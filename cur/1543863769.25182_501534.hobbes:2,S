Yes, VM page aging and page replacement algorithm should decide on the
relevance of anon or mmap page.  However we may still need to limit
total pages in memory for a given set of process.

That is why my suggestion would be not to touch mmapped pagecache
pages in the current pagecache limit code.  The limit should concern
only unmapped pagecache pages.
When the application unmaps the pages, then instantly we would go over
limit and 'now' unmapped pages can be reclaimed.  This behavior has
been verified with my fix on top of Christoph's patch.
