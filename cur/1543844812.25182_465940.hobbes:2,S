It really depends on the distribution, and even more of the specific
product. I know for a fact that Suse has no interest in supporting
additional hardware in the saa7134 driver for SLES10, for example. I
suspect that distributions only backport hardware support when a
customer asks for it, and they have some in-house knowledge to do it
safely.
My original understanding was that 2.6.16.y was meant to be a common
tree between different distributions and products, containing only the
unquestionable fixes - i.e. security, data corruption and other oopses,
in the -stable spirit - and then different distributions would add their
own patches on top of it as they see fit.
