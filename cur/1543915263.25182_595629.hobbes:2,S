BDI should be back in -mm, for the other its in shambles atm, I'll tell
you where to find it when I've put it back together.
I should get myself some time to read on how to push relative git
trees, as I did get myself a kernel.org account.

NBD has some serious block layer issues, I once talked with Jens about
it and he explained what needed to be done to get NBD back in
shape again, but I could not be bothered to spend time on it.
[ and have since forgotten most of the details :-/ ]
For me NBD is dead and broken beyond repair, it needs a wholesale
rewrite.
