Hi, Team
I am useing a dynamic address to access the cable modem. But I cann't establishe the eth0 interface. It looks I didn't receive a address. The ethernet card is connected to a cable modem.
The second question is I recompiled the kernal which included Crystal sound card. And it passed when system boot. But I cann't get any voice service.
Would anybody kindly help me?
Sincerely Yours,
Yunqu Liu
