Doh.  It should be ET_DYN.  I had relocatable much to much on the brain,
and so I stuffed in the wrong type.

Sorry about that.  
ET_DYN without a PT_DYNAMIC segment, without a PT_INTERP segment,
and with a valid entry point is exactly that.  Loaders never perform
relocation processing on a ET_DYN executable but they are allowed to
shift all of the addresses by a single delta so long as all of the
alignment restrictions are honored.
Relocation processing when it happens comes from the dynamic linker,
which is set in PT_INTERP and the dynamic linker looks a PT_DYNAMIC
to figure out what relocations are available for processing.
The basic issue is that ld don't really comprehend what we are doing
since we are building a position independent executable in a way
that the normal tools don't allow, so we have to poke the header.
If we had compiled with -fPIC we could have specified -pie or
--pic-executable to ld and it would have done the right thing.
But as it is our executable only changes physical addresses and
not virtual addresses something completely foreign to ld.
