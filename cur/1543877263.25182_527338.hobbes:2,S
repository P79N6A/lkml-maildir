This is because there is a CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN option.
If this option is not selected, max_scsi_luns will be set to 1 and
the RAID arrays with lun>0 will disappear(because they are not
scanned). That is unacceptable from a user's view point.  I have
also explained this in the code comment:
	/*
	 * firmware uses id/lun pair for a logical drive, but lun would be
	 * always 0 if CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN not configured, so we use
	 * channel to map lun here
	 */
If it is not allowed to map channel to lun, then maybe I have to
report 128 targets and do the mapping in queuecommand...
After all there must be a mapping somewhere so I don't see
much difference here...
I paste the patch again, is the format ok?
The internal id/lun mapping of st_vsc and st_vsc1 controllers is different
from st_shasta. The original driver code can only  map first 16 'entities'
for st_vsc and st_vsc1 while there are actually 128 available.
The correct mapping should be:
channel:0~7, id:0~15 (st_shasta, console is channel:0, id:16, lun:0)
channel:0~127, id:0 (st_yosemite, console is channel:0, id:1, lun:0)
channel:0, id:0~127 (st_vsc and st_vsc1, console is channel:0, id:128, lun:0)
