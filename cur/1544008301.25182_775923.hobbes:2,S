Hmm, unless I am missing something, sys_rt_sigqueuinfo() does this:
        if (info.si_code >= 0)
                return -EPERM;
This does not prevent user from setting si_code to SI_ASYNCIO, which,
from include/asm-generic/siginfo.h is:
#define SI_ASYNCIO      -4              /* sent by AIO completion */
Also,
#define SI_FROMUSER(siptr)      ((siptr)->si_code <= 0)
SI_ASYNCIO qualifies as SI_FROMUSER() even when it originates from
kernel (usb/core/devio.c async_completed())...

... so what I meant is that in send_signal(), it will be harder to
determine in the SI_ASYNCIO case whether the signal is from driver or
rt_sigqueueinfo().
If we know that it came from rt_sigqueueinfo(), we can safely check
the namespace. If it came from driver we should skip the ns check.

Ah, I see the problem now. The 't' refers to the task parameter - how
about changing comment to:
	/* If receiver can't see us, we are from parent ns */
