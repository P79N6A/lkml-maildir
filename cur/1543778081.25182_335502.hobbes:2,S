I imagine you, like me, are currently sitting in the Xen talk,
and I don't believe they are or will do anything so dumb as to throw away
or lose information.  yes, in principle, the logic will need to be 
somewhere, and I'm suggesting that the virtualization logic should
be in VMM-only code so it has literally zero effect on host-native 
processes.  *or* the host-native fast-path.

but to really do CKRM, you are going to want quite extensive interaction with
the scheduler, VM page replacement policies, etc.  all incredibly
performance-sensitive areas.
actually, let me also say that CKRM is on a continuum that includes 
current (global) /proc tuning for various subsystems, ulimits, and 
at the other end, Xen/VMM's.  it's conceivable that CKRM could wind up
being useful and fast enough to subsume the current global and per-proc
tunables.  after all, there are MANY places where the kernel tries to 
maintain some sort of context to allow it to tune/throttle/readahead
based on some process-linked context.  "embracing and extending"
those could make CKRM attractive to people outside the mainframe market.

CKRM may have its place in an externally-maintained patch ;)
