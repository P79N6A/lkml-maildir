And you got me!  In the heat of the moment I overlooked the fact that you and 
Greg haven't agreed to the merge yet ;-)
Clearly, I ought to have asked why dlmfs can't be done by configfs.  It is the 
same paradigm: drive the kernel logic from user-initiated vfs methods.  You 
already have nearly all the right methods in nearly all the right places.
