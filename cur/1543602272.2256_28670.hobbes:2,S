Add a
MODULE_LICENSE("(c) copyright foo, readers will be mangled with the DMCA")
or appropriate tag to it.
That tag is read by modutils (and ignored by older ones) and tells it the
code is non free. 
Nvidia asked about the MODULE_LICENSE tag code being GPL so to make them 
happy I also released it as below to avoid any confusion
