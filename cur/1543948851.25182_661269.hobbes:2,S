Move the watchdog/0 thread to a cpuset that doesn't have access to cpu 0.

Same situation occurs for a task bound to a cpuset that issues a 
sched_setaffinity() call to restrict its cpumask further.  There's nothing 
new there.

I'd hesitate to do that unless you can guarantee that restricting 
kthreads mems_allowed via the cpuset interface won't cause any problems 
either.  Is there a benefit to reducing the size of a kthread's 
mems_allowed that doesn't have an adverse effect on the kernel?  What 
about kswapd?

You can move them, but you cannot reduce the size of the thread's 
cpus_allowed since it was bound to a specific cpu via kthread_bind().  The 
change to set_cpus_allowed() simply prevents this from happening in the 
kernel as opposed to just stopping the possibility through cpusets.

Sure.
