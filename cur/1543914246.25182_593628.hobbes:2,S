This is the first I've heard of a problem like this.
Since you boot with acpi=off and sysrq stops working,
I really have to suspect a mainboard interrupt problem.

Unless the mainboard in question is known to be a totally
lost cause for ACPI, the first step should be to get ACPI
working.
If it's an older mainboard it might not need ACPI,
but then you should build and boot an ACPI-free kernel.
(I wouldn't trust acpi=off to be equivalent to CONFIG_ACPI=n.)
If the mainboard has an I/O-APIC then you should make sure
that the kernel can find and use it.
