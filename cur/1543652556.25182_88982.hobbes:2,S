They should work, obviously with some caveats. Having 2 hosts both
trying to reconstruct the same md RAID1 may cause some troubles.

Could be a stack related problem with the qlogic driver. The additional
stack pressure of the md layer perhaps ?? The 20-60 lines of logs in
would probably give some ideas.
I have a couple of shared storage clusters that were using qla2300
driver, ext3 and LVM1 and they would periodically ooops. Removed LVM
and the systems are now rock solid.
