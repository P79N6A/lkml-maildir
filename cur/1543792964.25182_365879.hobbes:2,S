The size of the remote cache depends on many factors. The application can 
influence that by setting memory policies.

Yes it can be quite large. On some of my tests with applications these are 
100%. This is typical if the application sets the policy in such a way 
that all allocations are off node or if the kernel has to allocate memory 
on a certain node for a device.

Small scale NUMA machines may benefit from swap prefetch but on larger 
machines people usually try to avoid swap altogether.
