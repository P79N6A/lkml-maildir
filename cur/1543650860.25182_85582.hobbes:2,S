It is much much more important that ACPI be *correct* than fast or small. To
that end, it is better to not fork ACPI-Linux from ACPI-everyone else. Linux
benefits from core bugs found by other OSes (FBSD is not the only one - for
some reason I'm not allowed to mention who else is using ACPI CA but they
*do* send bug reports) and vice versa.

I'm used to ACPI ranting from all quarters, you know that ;-) but let me
just say this:
- ACPI is not performance-critical
- ACPI will never be simple and elegant, even if you made it Linux-specific
- Portability enhances correctness and maximizes developer productivity
- Read my lips, no new taxes!
(dunno where that last one came from ;-)
