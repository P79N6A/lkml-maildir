Both of these seem a pretty good idea.  Should be in version 0.03 which
I'll try and get to Andrew over the weekend.  Example reports from files
in 2.6.22-rc2-mm1 below.
-apw
spinlock_t definition without comment
FILE: lib/statistic.c:243:
+       spinlock_t lock;
struct mutex definition without comment
FILE: include/linux/kernelcapi.h:67:
+       struct mutex recv_mtx;
memory barrier without comment
FILE: fs/ext2/balloc.c:1250:
+       smp_rmb();
