That's a little bit more than just the higher order pagecache patch.
But I don't know if that would be impossible to do with the "attempt
to allocate contiguous pagecache" approach either. Or if it would be
worthwhile to support.

I guess any page size bloats the pagecache relative to something
smaller :) But 4K doesn't seem to be proving too much problem for
x86 and I'm not talking about an actual implementation coming up,
but just a size that would make sense in future (and probably last
for a long time).
