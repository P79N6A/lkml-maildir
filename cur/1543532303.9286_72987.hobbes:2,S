    In the case where your network arrangement is to bring up the
    network when the device is initialized, then everything gets left
    alone until you take the device away, it doesn't break things, but
    just adds unsightly messages (at least with the Mastodon rc.network
    code all I get is one or two complaints when route runs) to your
    /dev/console output.
    I simply hold my nose and grumble when I see the duplicate routes.

    david parsons \bi/ In the menu of broken interfaces, automagic routes
                   \/  are a pretty minor annoyance.  ``use ip instead of
		       route'', on the other hand, is simply bad manners.
