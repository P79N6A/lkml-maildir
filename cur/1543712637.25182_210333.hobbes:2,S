Subject: [PATCH] ppc64: Add a sync in context switch on SMP

Hi !
For the same reason as ppc32, we need to ensure that all stores
done on a CPU has reached the coherency domain and are visible
to loads done by another CPU when context switching as the same
thread may be rescheduled almost right away there.
Ben.
