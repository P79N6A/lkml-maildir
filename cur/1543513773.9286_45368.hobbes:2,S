Hello Ilpo,
I cc this message to all other ISDN developers, I 'm more responsible for
the hardware driver part.

This is independ from ISDN hardware.

Interesting, because this function is called only in out direction (the
space in headroom is need for the syncppp header).
Maybe be some of the part which send a ACK for tcp don't alloc enougth
headroom.
The question is, is it possible to change this behaviour.
Again, no headroom isn't a error, only a bad thing, which cost a extra
copy of the frame to have enought place for the header.
If it is not possible that these parts know about our need of headroom, we
should remove the message.
What I don't understand is, that most frames seems to have enought headroom
and only some make trouble here.

OK. deleting the message is save and should only recompile this file, if you
don't did a make clean.
