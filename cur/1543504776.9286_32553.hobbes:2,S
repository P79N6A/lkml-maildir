Me too.  X is invariably running (not necessarily with a screensaver) when
it happens.  There are oopsen, but they show up on the VT, not much good
if you can't switch out of X.  I've gotten some of them by switching out
of X and waiting for them to occur.  I've written some of them down and it
looks like mad recursion through these functions:
stext_lock
do_page_fault
stext_lock
error_code
del_timer
do_exit
die_if_no_fixup
do_generic_file_read
stext_lock
error_code
del_timer
die
die_if_no_fixup
do_generic_file_read
stext_lock ....(back to top at do_page_fault)
Code: 89 02 85 c0 74 03 89 50 04 b8 01 00 00 00 eb 03 90 31 c0 c7
I've also noticed that this tends to happens when the loadavg is high
(i.e. 04:00 when the daily crontabs run).  It kills the interrupt handler,
attempts to kill the idle task, and doesn't sync (according to the OOPS).
Unfortunately the OOPS scrolls up, up, and away with no way to go back and
see the registers, et al.  The kernel is 2.2.7 patched with devfs.  I can
reproduce the problem if anyone needs more info.

Yes there is an oops, when you leave the machine, switch it to a VT and
you'll have your oops when you come back instead of a frozen X display.  
If you're interrupt handler's being killed too, then the tight hang is to
be expected.  Nothing is enabled when the kernel is in granite mode :)
