Subject: [QUESTION] Can't make 2.5.46 due to errors with llc_sap_open, etc

I have the 2.5.46 make working up to the errors below.  I am doing this so I
can test with the new epoll features.  To get this far, all I had to do was
apply a patch I found in the 2.5.45-ac1 tree (to address some errors in
net/ipv4/ipmr.c).  Do I need to disable LLC?  Or enable something so LLC
gets included in the make?  Is there a more stable release that includes the
epoll support?  I am running RedHat 7.3.  Any help is greatly appreciated.
