have a look at:

basically you have to find a way to set some specific PCI registers of the
northbridge. 
check out the write handler of this is /proc/bus/pci/00/00.0
it's at linux/drivers/pci/proc.c:proc_bus_pci_write
basically it looks like you have to seek to the "register" via lseek and
then write the control value.
shouldn't be that hard.
in worst case you could write a 20-line linux kernel module to set the
few required pci registers.
