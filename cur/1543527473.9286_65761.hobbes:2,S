I know the feeling...

I use it on two of my systems, as follows:
 1. I have all my systems NFS mount the /usr/doc directory from one
    of them, on which it's a separate partition with the various
    documents all e2comp'd
 2. My development machine has a large partition mounted as /usr/src
    with everything in it e2comp'd and this works fine.
I'm also now joint developer of e2comp with the aim of getting it in
the kernel as standard ASAP.
Best wishes from Riley.
