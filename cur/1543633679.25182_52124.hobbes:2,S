ho hum.  we're straying from the topic here, but you've missed the point.
yes, a typical HTTP cache has a hit-rate around 30-35%.
any "margin of error" is on the basis of TCP retransmissions, IP+TCP header 
overhead, ...
that wouldn't negate a hit-rate.  rather, its 10-25% margin-of-error on the 
30-35% hit-rate.  ie. (0.1 x 0.35) or: 3.5% of the hit-rate may be in error.
but seeing as a HTTP cache is in essence glueing two TCP connections 
togethers, whats to say that the client wouldn't have had the TCP 
retransmissions in the first place?  all i'm talking about is ensuring that 
application "accounting" information is accurate.
right now, there is no method of doing that since the OS doesn't provide 
that data.

i know a thing or two about netflow and other accounting mechanisms that 
cisco has.  (i am a cisco employee even if this particular topic isn't 
related to the work i do for them).
netflow counts statistics at layer2/3/4.
unfortunately, its rather hard to use netflow when a single stream goes to 
two places.
e.g. an idle HTTP/1.1 persistent connection can be reused for a different 
HTTP client.  netflow will only show a single flow, but there may be 
multiple HTTP requests from multiple (downstream) clients on that.
how about Pipelined Persistent connections?
what about streaming-media where a live stream is split to multiple clients?

since you obviously know lots about this topic, what "superior solutions" 
do you have?
cheers,
lincoln.
PS. personally i don't care if squid has this or not - its been many many 
years since i contributed any code to squid - but i do have a personal 
interest in helping make linux a better OS.
