We can't.  We've had various things (most notably MODVERSIONS prior to
2.6) which are unhappy with that, and in the end, the problem ends up
being fixed elsewhere.  In fact, this should be able to as well.  Using
your time.c example:
(gdb) break arch/i386/kernel/time.c:set_rtc_mmss
Breakpoint 3 at 0xc010ee90: file arch/i386/kernel/time.c, line 174.
(gdb) break kernel/time.c:sys_time 
Breakpoint 4 at 0xc011f0cc: file time.h, line 301.
So shouldn't it be a matter of somehow just not having a time.c
reference as well in the debug data?
