Hi Ted !
Hopefully, somebody is gathering those patches. I intend to merge them
all at one point, though I can't promise it will happen before 2.6.12.
It would be good to "ping" me regulary though ;)
I've sort-of been waiting for ATI to tell me how to retreive the proper
memory register setting from the BIOS, since the code in there currently
is quite powerbook specific, and might not write the exact correct value
on all models. I suppose it works fine on yours so far, but I'd rather
have a way to know the right value ... unfortunately, they didn't reply
on this request.
Ben.
