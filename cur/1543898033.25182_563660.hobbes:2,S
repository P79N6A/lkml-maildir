Hm, yes. But what? Is it reasonable for people to include <linux/in.h>
and <netinet/in.h> at the same time? 
It's suboptimal that they have to include <linux/in.h> for certain
definitions, but that file also provides conflicting definitions of
stuff which exists elsewhere.
Should we split <linux/in.h> into two parts?
