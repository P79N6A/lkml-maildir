It is much more complicated than than you describe. Go look at the ROM
code already checked in. Laptop video ROMs are not simple PCI devices
that can be mapped around. They are stored in compressed form inside
the system ROM and expanded at boot. If you lose the shadow copy in
RAM there is no API for getting it back. These compressed ROMs are the
source of a lot of laptop user's problems with suspend/resume on
Linux.
VGA support for multiple cards is a very complicated problem. It
really needs to be comprehenisvely designed (but not necessarily
implemented all at once). What we have now is twenty years worth of
hacks that work 95% of the time. But there are many, many holes in the
current scheme.
