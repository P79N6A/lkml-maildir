	There is no solution that is general and inexpensive.  STONITH
is as close as it gets, and we don't have support for that.  On other
platforms where the shared disk is on FC, the device driver supports
fencing nodes from the switch.
	That said, this module isn't exclusively useful to a
cluster+shared disk environment.  If it were, I couldn't see generic
inclusion.  This code is useful in many other situations.
