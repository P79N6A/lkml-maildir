I have done some archeology, and our ancient CVS logs show this check 
was introduced in early 2005 into our 2.6.x. codebase. However, it 
existed way before, and was copied from our prehistorical ext2 split 
named xip2 back in the old days of 2.4.x where we did not really have 
a block device behind because that one was scamped into the file 
system in a very queer way.
After all, I don't see any risk in removing the check. The only driver 
we have that does direct_access is drivers/s390/block/dcssblk.c, and 
that one only supports block_size == PAGE_SIZE. I think the patch 
should go into mainline.
