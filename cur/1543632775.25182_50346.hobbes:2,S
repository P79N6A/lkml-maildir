All the authoritative literature says that
RAID-10 is striped mirrors (survive ~1/n 2 disk failures.)
RAID-0+1 is mirrored stripes (survive ~1/2 2 disk failures.)
What he is describing would be RAID-5+1, mirrored RAID-5s.
RAID-15 would be a RAID-5 of mirrors.
Both of these could survive any 3 disk failures.
