IA-64 already has some arch. specific code to allocate a sparse
virtual memory map ... having generic code to do so would be
nice, but I foresee some chicken&egg problems in getting enough
of the vmalloc/vmap framework up & running before mem_map[] has
been allocated.
That and the hotplug memory folks don't like the virtual mem_map
code and have spurned it in favour of SPARSE.
