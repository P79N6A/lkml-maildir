The first thing to do when looking at assembly language files
is to find what symbols are global (.globl or .global). Unlike
'C' the stuff doesn't default to being visible from other
files. Given that, you will see that code executes from
startup_32, the only way "in" since it's the only global
symbol. The second instruction is 'cli', which will disable
interrupts on the current processor.
Now, later on in the code is the sequence:
 		pushl	$0
 		popfl
... which will further clear any flags so the interrupt-enable
flag is truly disabled there, also. Later on, there are redundant
'cld' instructions as well as an additional 'cli' instruction.
These probably occurred because the code was assembled from
various pieces and nobody bothered to review it for such
redundancy.
Getting rid of the extra instructions will save 3 or 4 bytes
of code. Since this code executes only once, it's certainly
not in the "fast-path" so nobody has bothered to clean it.
If you would like to clean up the code and submit a patch
it probably would be accepted.
I will test any patch you may want to produce.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
