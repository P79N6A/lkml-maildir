Hmm, you're looking at an older kernel there I guess - that routine
doesn't exist anymore.  Look at -mm, its the most recent version.

There is no IRIX/Linux compatibility layer, you're misunderstanding
the code (which is understandable, its erm a bit crufty in places).
There's a fair bit of history there too - *shrug* - its on the improve
but its a complex body of code and takes time to mutate.  We've tended
to focus on real problems and needed features in the past, moreso than
cosmetics, but thats getting attention nowadays too.

Yep, agreed.
cheers.
