I have found a way to create the file-system problem!  Just build
the kernel and, from another terminal execute `sync`. The build will
fail with multiple errors caused by corrupted files. The files
are not actually corrupted, though. Just restart the build and it
will complete.
So there is something that `sync` triggers that results in apparent
file system corruption. Once files are re-read, they are fine.
This does not explain the permanent file-system corruption that
sometimes occurs --that may occur during the `umount`.
I don't use IDE. I use BusLogic SCSI, 250 Mb RAM, Pentium-III(2), SMP.
Linux 2.4.1 (no postfix).
