Hrm... I see, but I still for some reason don't like it that much.. I'd
rather have misc_register() do the initialisation unconditionally before
it can fail, don't you think ?
We would theorically have a similar problem with any driver that does
xxxx_register(&static_struct)
and
xxxx_unregister(&static_struct)
(pci, usb, etc...)
As long as there are list heads involved. I think the proper solution
here is to have either the unregister be smart and test for NULL/NULL or
the register initialize those fields before it has a chance to fail.
Ben.
