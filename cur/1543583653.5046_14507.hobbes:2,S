Greetings.
I built a 2.4.0 kernel and installed th bzImage in boot, configured
in lilo, etc. I also upgraded my modutils to 2.4.3. After that
when I tried to boot from the new kernel, I am getting
the following error message continuously.
kmod: failed to exec /sbin/modprobe -s -l binfmt-464c, errno = 8.
Is there any other package in addition to modutils, that also
needs upgrade ? or is there anything wrong with the image ?
Any help is appreciated.
