The other thing to figure out is to what extent we can clean up the 
conditionals in the video mode code by refactoring.  All they really do 
here is save space by removing functionality not needed for wakeup, 
because I didn't know how much space was realistic.
It's possible we can remove them altogether by having a dummy 
boot_params structure (4K).
