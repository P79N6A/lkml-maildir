But you only install it to waste space, develop, or run applications
that use it. What's the difference?

You'd expect distributors to ship a Python version that's suited for
Kernel configuration by then. If they don't, well, get another
distribution.

Why not? You expect people to have a not-too recent GCC, GNU make and
other tools, so why not Python?
Of course, a standalone code that'd run out of C would be fine, but if
that comes with less maintainability or would be more difficult to
maintain, there's nothing to be gained.
Is there a py2c compiler? If so, it might be useful if kernel.org
carried a compiled version of CML2, if at all possible.
But I feel there's no need to whine about 2.6. Enough time for
distributors to ship their distributions with Python 2.x.1 and for
distributors or third parties to package Python2 for older distribution
releases.
The only valid point might be "embedded systems", but then again, you
should be able to cross compile the kernel for your embedded system for
fun and for speed.
