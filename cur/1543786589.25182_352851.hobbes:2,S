This should deal with the node ownership issue. So yes.
I still have some open question on how pages ended up on the wrong node.
This should only happen if a zone / node has run out of memory. If pages 
ended up on the wrong node without that then there may be a different 
issue still to be fixed.
Maybe Petr can give us some more details on when the problem occurs?
