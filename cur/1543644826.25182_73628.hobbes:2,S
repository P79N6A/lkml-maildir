Sure, but if they were unified (that is what I understood what the original
poster wanted to do) then they would be suddenly much more performance
critical and need fine grained locking.

P.S.: One big performance problem currently is ip_conntrack. It has a bad
hash function and tends to have a too big working set (beyond cache size)
Some tuning in this regard would help a lot of workloads.
