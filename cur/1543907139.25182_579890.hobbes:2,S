With the patch, things seem to be much better (but I'm no expert).
The things remaining seem to be:
- sound can't be heard
- MPlayer gives an error, instead of doing nothing.
I've enabled debugging, and did the following, without and with the patch:
boot, mplayer start+pause, suspend, resume, mplayer unpause+exit+start+exit,
rmmod.
Below is an edited diff of the dmesges (printk's begin with a "k"),
without and with the patch, with my comments added. I hope this is 
enough info. If you need the full dmesges, let me know.
Anyway, thanks for you work :)
