I am using the yellowfin ethernet driver with my:
Ethernet controller: Symbios Logic Inc. (formerly NCR) 83C885 (rev 02)
card. I got *lots* of "transmit timed out messages" until I edited the driver
and changed:
#elif YF_NEW                                    /* A future perfect board
                                                   :->.  */
to
#elif YF_NEW||1                                    /* A future perfect board
Now I don't get any transmit timed out problems. I don't think this is a
bugfix, maybe this is just hiding a problem somewhere. Anyway, it seems
that my symbios card is "a future perfect board".
