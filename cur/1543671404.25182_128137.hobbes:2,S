IEEE-1394 is marked "EXPERIMENTAL" for a reason. It's not stable. Just
because it exists in a stable kernel doesn't mean the tree adheres to
the same principals. Fixing a crash at the cost of making you run a
simple script for an interim is a likely thing in an EXPERIMENTAL
subsystem. If you would rather hotplug work, at the cost of your system
crashing after two or three reconnects...then maybe you need to be
running some more unstable code.

The rescan-scsi-bus.sh info has been there since sbp2 was introduced
over a year ago.

USB also allocates a template/host for each device. Sorry, but I'm not
about to go that far. Not to mention the callback system in USB is
different than IEEE1394. So the same logic doesn't transfer.

That's what /sbin/hotplug et al are for. If you want dork-free hotplug
in scsi/ieee1394, use 2.5.x.
Look, I'm not going to get pulled into this argument anymore. If you
want to control how ieee1394 is developed, join the list and put up, or
just shut up.
