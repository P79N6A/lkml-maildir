Nope. devd is notified when the device shows up. It can then go and create
/dev/printer/0 and do some other magic, if needed. When you try to open the
file, it is there. That in turn might trigger loading modules and
initializing the device.
Note that if devd is missing, but the device files are extant, everything
is peachy.
