Hello Andrew,
You would need contact one of the administrators of the LSE project for this.
You would need a developer id for uploading. You can get all the information 
from 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/lse/.
I think it will be very helpful to have the results including lockmeter
and kernprof data available in lse.sourceforge.net.
Thanks
Dipankar
