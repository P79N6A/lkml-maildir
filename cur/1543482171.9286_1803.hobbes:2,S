One of the ugly weaknesses of Unix is that because it's basically an ad

often inadequate security mechanisms (which themselves are ad hoc
answers to security problems with other ad hoc solutions).

Windows is an abomination in the eyes of an OS designer. It's big, it's
dumb, it's ugly and it always needs some extra stitches to hold it
together... I guess one could call it The Frankenstein's Monster:-)
