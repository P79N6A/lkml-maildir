  Hi, all. Version 205 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
Patch directly available from:
ftp://ftp
.??.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rgooch/v2.5/devfs-patch-current.gz
AND:
ftp://ftp.atnf.csiro.au/pub/people/rgooch/linux/kernel-patches/v2.5/devfs-patch-current.gz
NOTE: kernel 2.5.1 and later require devfsd-v1.3.19 or later.
This is against 2.5.2-pre2. Highlights of this release:
- Corrected (made useful) debugging message in <unregister>
- Moved <kmem_cache_create> in <mount_devfs_fs> to <init_devfs_fs>
- Fixed drivers/md/lvm-fs.c to create "lvm" entry
- Added magic number to guard against scribbling drivers
- Only return old entry in <devfs_mk_dir> if a directory
- Defined macros for error and debug messages
- Updated README from master HTML file
				Regards,
					Richard....
