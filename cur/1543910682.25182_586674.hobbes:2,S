But that's okay. Maybe SElinux is not simple enough to use for
everyone, but that does not mean you can't auto-generate policy from
something else, "easy to understand".
IOW smack may be great idea, but you written it in wrong language. You
written it in C, while you should have written it in SELinux policy
language (and your favourite scripting language as frontend).
