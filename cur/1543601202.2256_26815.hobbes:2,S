This is just to confirm that the final patch send out by Robert works fine. I have tested the
patch against 2.4.10-pre9 and it applies, builds and works properly. I can see no ill effects of
this patch, it correctly identifies my AMD 761 chipset and everything works perfectly.
Below are the relevant parts of dmesg output from my box to show that everything is fine:
...
Linux agpgart interface v0.99 (c) Jeff Hartmann
agpgart: Maximum main memory to use for agp memory: 439M
agpgart: Detected AMD 761 chipset
agpgart: AGP aperture is 64M @ 0xf8000000
...
NVRM: loading NVIDIA kernel module version 1.0-1251
NVRM: not using NVAGP, AGPGART is loaded!!
Best regards,

PS. I have also tested the patch that Robert send out to correct the config name, and I can
confirm that that one also works as expected.
