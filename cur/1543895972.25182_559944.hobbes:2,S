Well, considering that I've made this claim myself as part of my
complete argument in a number of times I've presented it, yes, this is
understandable and correct.  This is indeed one of the cases.
That said, very few companies have a scrict *requirement* for keeping
the ability to modify the software on the customer's computer while
denying this ability to the customer.
So this case you're discussing is the least common case.  It could
nearly be dismissed, rather than being the dominating topic in the
discussion, as it's been so far.

Ok.  Most of these can be addressed (with inconvenience) with ROM.
Others are business reasons, and for these, the increased cost and
inconvenience of the alternatives may shift them to an unlock
situation.

It's not my definition.  This was from Wikipedia.

Depends on what the different term was.
