Subject: NFS: msync required for data writes to server?

Hi Trond,
On our 2.6.9 based systems, data written using mmap(MAP_SHARED) on a NFS
client is *never* being pushed out to the server if an explicit msync call
is not issued before the munmap.
On 11/12/04, there was a message thread concerning NFS corruption when
using mmap/munmap:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-nfs&m=110028817508318&w=2
In this thread you stated:
     mmap() offers absolutely NO guarantees that the file will be synced to
     disk on close. Use msync(MS_SYNC) if you want such a guarantee.
Are you saying that the data will *never* be written to the server?  Could
you please clarify your position on this further? 
Thanks!
Linda
