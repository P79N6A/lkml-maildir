Why do swapcache pages have their ->index in ->private?  That should have
been commented.
(hugetlb pages are also added to pagecache, and they are compound, but the

The BUG_ON in radix_tree_tag_set() is a fairly arbitrary sanity check:
"hey, why are you tagging a non-existent item?".
We could simply replace it with a `return NULL;'?
