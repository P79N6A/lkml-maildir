Can someone tell me if the following 2.1 -> 2.0 translations are
(approximately) correct or if there is something more appropriate
to use in 2.0.*.
  2.1.* sock_sendmsg(sock, &msg, size );
  2.0.* sock->ops->sendmsg(sock, &msg, size, 0, 0); 
  2.1.* sock_recvmsg(sock, &msg, size, 0 );  
  2.0.* sock->ops->recvmsg(sock, &msg, size, 0, 0, 0 );
(it seems to work up to a point)
Peter
