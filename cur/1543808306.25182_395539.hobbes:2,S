The problem I have with doing that is that it makes more work. Adding support 
for multiple sets of pages is a more fundamental change, and so should be 
done earlier. Let me use an analogy from evolutionary theory (yes, I think 
evolution is flawed, but let's ignore that for the mo). If you were trying to 
image the steps by which an amoeba became a human being, would you put the 
devlopment of the cardio-vascular system before the development of eye sight? 
Making eye sight work (if it was at all possible) without a cardio vascular 
system would result in a fundamentally different design for the eye than if 
you did the cario-vascular system first. Changing the eye once the 
cardio-vascular system was in would be a huge redevelopment, and a huge pain. 
For the same reasons, I think that if support for 2 pagesets was going to be 
put in an implementation it should be done as early as possible. Likewise for 
reworking the method by which data is stored (I say, thinking of bitmaps vs 
pbes).
Regards,
Nigel
