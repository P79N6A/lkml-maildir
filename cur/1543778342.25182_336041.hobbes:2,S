Are these hangs temporary or permanent?  If they are temporary (ie: the
kernel recovers OK) then we should call them "stalls".  Because a "hang" is
considered to be a permanent state.
Either way, we need to know where the kernel is stuck.  Adding
`initcall_debug' to your kernel boot command may help.
And when the hang/stall occurs, hit the ALT-SSQRQ-P and ALT-SYSRQ-T key
combinations and send us the resulting traces.
Thanks.
