Probably.  By the time a few KB of metadata are corrupted, I'm reaching 
for my backup.  I don't care what filesystem it is or how easy it is to 
edit the on-disk structures.
This isn't to say that having robust on-disk structures isn't a good 
thing.  I have no idea how Reiser4 will hold up either way.  But 
ultimately, what you want is the journaling (so power failure / crashes 
still leave you in an OK state), backups (so when blocks go bad, you 
don't care), and performance (so you can spend less money on hardware 
and more money on backup hardware).
