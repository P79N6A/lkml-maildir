Ahh, I think you may be right for some CPUs. The zero selector is indeed 
potentially faster to load, since it doesn't have to even bother looking 
at the GDT/LDT.
That said, I doubt it's very noticeable. I just ran tests on both an old 
P4 and on a more modern Core 2 machine, and for both of those the 
performance was identical between loading a NUL selector and loading it 
with a non-zero one.
But I could well imagine that it matters a few cycles on other CPU's. But 
from my testing, it definitely isn't noticeable, and I think the 
maintenance advantage of using the same segment setup would more than make 
up for the fact that maybe some odd CPU can see a difference.
