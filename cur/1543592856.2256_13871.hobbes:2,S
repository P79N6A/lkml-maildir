__pa(page_address(pte_page(pte))) is the address you want. [or
pte_val(*pte) & (PAGE_SIZE-1) on x86 but this is platform-dependent.]

nope. Eg. on x86 these functions only walk normal 4K page pagetables, they
do not walk 4MB pages correctly. (which are set up on pentiums and better
CPUs, unless mem=nopentium is specified.)
a kernel virtual address can be decoded by simply doing __pa(kaddr). If
the page is a highmem page [and you have the struct page pointer] then you
can do [(page-mem_map) << PAGE_SHIFT] to get the physical address, but
only on systems where mem_map[] starts at physical address 0.
