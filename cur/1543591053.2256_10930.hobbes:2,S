I don't really think you have to. With 'lba32'
enabled (maybe also without that ... ) and just using lilo
normally it works with devfs.

ps: lilo.conf:
boot=/dev/discs/disc0/disc
lba32
...
image = /boot/244nospeak
  root = /dev/root
  label = nospeak
  append = "LOC=HOME"
flapp:~/bootdisk # lilo -V
LILO version 21.6
