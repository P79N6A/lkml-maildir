I just did ;)
the roadmap was
8K stacks  ->  dual 4k/8k option -> 4k stacks
this roadmap comes down to basically keeping the available stack space equal
over time (because yes if you see overflows with 4k you WILL see them with
8k too just it takes some fun firewall rules and a network interrupt at just
the right time). 
Your proposal adds a temporary "bulb" that suddenly "allows" code to bloat
into it...
