Hello Alan,
For your information, 2.4.1-ac12 works great on my Cyrix 6x86 P166+, and
it properly recognizes the CPU as i586 class.
I haven't tried 2.4.1-ac13 on that machine yet, but I did attempt to boot
2.4.1-ac13 on an Winchip-C6 machine.  It froze at the same place, i.e.
"Checking if this processor honours the WP bit even in supervisor
mode...".  2.4.1-ac12 works quite nicely on this machine, although I still
experience random crashes on this machine.  (Don't know if it is the
kernel or hardware problem... I have been having troubles with this
computer with just about any kernels since 2.2.17...)  One of these days,
when I have time, I'll post the Oops or the Bug.
Meanwhile, 2.4.x is rock solid on my Cyrix machine.  :-)
Thanks,
Anthony
