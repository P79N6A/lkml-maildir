While I don't think restorecon is really necessary to properly boot  
SELinux-enabled (I've got a Debian box with some heavily customized  
policy which does so just fine), I am of the opinion that adding a  
"name" parameter to the file/directory create actions would be  
useful.  For example, with such support you could actually specify a  
type-transition rule conditional on a specific name or substring:
named_type_transition sshd_t tmp_t:sock_file prefix "ssh-" ssh_sock_t;
Useful options for matching would be "prefix", "suffix", "substr 
(start,len)".  "regex" would be nice but is sorta computationally  
intensive and would be likely to cause more problems than it solves.

These can go away if you modify your policy and  pass "-o  
fscontext=system_u:object_r:dev_t" to the mount command for the /dev  
tmpfs, changing both the filesystem and the default directory labels  
from the default "system_u:object_r:tmpfs_t".  This will work as long  
as your policy files contain appropriate transitions from the dev_t  
type.

I believe these are to handle rebooting from non-SELinux mode.  There  
are two solutions to this kind of problem:
(1) Failing the boot if the labels are wrong
(2) Fixing the labels (and rebooting if necessary)
It would appear that FC does the latter, although for certain high- 
security systems (such as firewalls handling classified/confidential  
data), the first option is the only acceptable one.

I think this can be handled with some combination of appropriate  
SELinux policy and mount options.  At least, I don't need this in the  
boot scripts on my heavily customized Debian SELinux box.

I don't know what the point of this generic line is; but I certainly  
don't have anything of the sort on my test system, and it appears to  
work just fine.

Part of the reason that Fedora has a large quantity of that  
restorecon and restorecond crap is that there  is a certain amount of  
broken binary software needing executable stack/heap (such as  
flashplayer), programs without comprehensive or complete policies, or  
programs which by definition need extra support for SELinux.
For example, to really complete the SELinux model you need editors  
and tools which understand security labels the same way they  
understand UNIX permissions.  With a bit of vim scripting I can  
probably make it run external commands to read file labels before it  
reads the file itself and modify /proc/self/attr/fscreate before  
writing out the file, similar to the way it would keep track of the  
standard DAC permissions on files it modifies.
There's also the fact that corporate products have fixed release  
schedules so remaining bugs in each release tend to get papered over  
instead of fixed properly (such as the restorecon in FC init- 
scripts).  I haven't seen many problems with the SELinux model which  
aren't associated with working around buggy software or missing  
features.
