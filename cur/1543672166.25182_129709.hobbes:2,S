Does not look like it:
# find | grep -i pii
./bus/pci/drivers/piix4 smbus
./bus/pci/drivers/piix4 smbus/00:07.3
./bus/pci/drivers/PIIX IDE
./bus/pci/drivers/PIIX IDE/00:07.1
# find | grep -i i2c
./bus/i2c
./bus/i2c/drivers
./bus/i2c/drivers/lm75
./bus/i2c/drivers/dev driver
./bus/i2c/devices
./devices/pci0/00:07.3/i2c-0
