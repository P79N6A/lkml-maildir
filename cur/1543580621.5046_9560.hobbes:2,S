Shouldn't they be on inactive_clean anyway? They are not mapped
(if I read Stephens comment correctly) and are clean (because we
just read them in).
So if we have to put it there explicitly, we have at least a
performance bug, don't we?
Or do I still not get the new linux mm design? ;-(
Totally clueless
