ACK (and the few necessary equal or similar functions of the standard C
lib are implemented directly).
It depends on the to-be-integrated C++ source if it is clean enough from
these features (let alone from Win* specific stuff) so that it makes
sense to really integrate it (so that future versions can replace it
more easily) and just convert it to pure C (which may be less work now
but more of a maintenance headache).
And no, I don't think that building a "windriverwrapper" (a la
ndiswrapper) is a useful thing.
