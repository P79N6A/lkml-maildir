When I started the 2.4-hotfix tree nearly two years ago, I wanted to
avoid merging drivers changes as much as possible. And particularly,
I avoided to add support for new hardware. The reason is very simple.
I want to be able to guarantee that if 2.4.X works, then any 2.4.X.Y
does too so that they can blindly upgrade. And if, for any reason,
people suspect that 2.4.X.Y might have brought a bug, then reverting
to 2.4.X.Z(Z<Y) should at most bring back older bugs but not remove
previous support for any hardware. The problem with new hardware
support is that it can break sensible setups :
  - adding a new network card support will cause existing cards to be
    renumberred (it happened to me on several production systems when
    switching from 2.2 to 2.4)
  - adding support for a new IDE controller can cause hda to become
    hdc, or worse, hda to become sda (problems encountered when adding
    libata support)
  - enabling some devices might lock up memory and/or I/O address ranges
    on a bus leading to other devices not working anymore. I had this
    problem when using dlink 580 quad port nics in some buggy machines
    already equipped with adaptec starfire nics.
  - other core devices might cause system instability without the
    admin being aware they're really used (eg: ACPI, ...)
Since hardware diversity is so high that nobody can know everything, I
think it's better to avoid playing alone with people's hardware, but I
agree it's sometimes very hard to resist.
Adrian, when you have a doubt whether such a fix should go into next
release, simply tell people about the problem and ask them to test
current driver. If nobody encounters the problem, you can safely keep
the patch in your fridge until someone complains. By that time, the
risks associated with this patch will be better known.

Even this might be dangerous in late -stable releases, unless it was a
recent regression.
Just my 2 cents,
Willy
