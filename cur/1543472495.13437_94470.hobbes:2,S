This e-mail tries to give my view of the results of the recent
discussion about raw device-IO and mmap-readahead. It consists of three 
"suggention-flags" that can be used on fopen. The mm-people already opinions
about this stuff, consider this document as a suggestion of how things
_could_ become in 2.3.xxx
File-level
----------
O_Direct
	Hints the kernel that caching and read-ahead for requests to this
        file are not a good idea. This usually means that the application 
	knows access-patternsbetter and performs it's own caching; any
	memory that would be spend on kernel-caching is better used for this 
	application.
	Possible usage:
	* Databases (Oracle and others)
	* Scientific (Huge matrices)
	* All files that you need only once (configuration files)
	Kernels view:
	If blocks are in the memory already, give them to the app.
	If they aren't read them in, give them to the app but don't
	cache them. On write, flush and release all blocks.	
O_Serialized
	Hints the kernel that the file is read in a serial/linear way,
	and that caching old results isn't usefull but that Read-ahead,
	Read-behind and Write-clustering are.
	Possible usage:
	* Multimedia applications (video-streaming, MP3-playing)
	* tar, gzip and others
	* grep
	* Reading configuration-files
	Kernels view:
	Read:
	Read-ahead is a good idea, so it can read-ahead more than usual.
	Pages that have been sent to the appl. can be freed immediatly.
	Write:
	Cluster writes, once written to disk, free the pages immediatly.
O_Entirely
	Hints the kernel that the entire contents in the file will be
	used. This way, read-ahead is definitly a good idea, and if
	the file is "small", it can be read entirely and asynchronously on 
	fopen,	even before any data is actually read. This can make the 
	reads effectively "non-blocking" 
	Possible usage:
	* in a C-compiler: .c and .h files
	* opening shell-scripts
	* in a webserver for documents that are to be sent
	* all _files_ with the sticky-bit
	Kernels view:
	On a fopen, all the blocks (for a "small" file) are scheduled to
	be read from "disk".  For large files, only the first N blocks are
	scheduled.
	On a read, the blocks already are in memory (hopefully). For a large
	file, if more than M blocks are read in so far, the next M blocks
	are read-ahead pre-emtively
Kernel-level
------------
Zero-copy TCP/IP
	It is possible to have a zero-copy TCP/IP stack, at least up to
	a certain extend. Don't ask me how;
	I know this because a fellow-student has implemented this in a 
	"embedded TCP/IP" device [aka settop-box].
Device-DMA to file
	Sendfile and friends seem like a good idea here. This can be
	used for video/audio-capture. Maybe a streamfile() that "connects"
	to files and transfers all data between them is an option.
