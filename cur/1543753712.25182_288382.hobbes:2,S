I do not like to refer to a dev because I do not quite understand where
the necessary usb_dev_get/_put are now. But if you guarantee that the
urb->dev is refcounted properly while urb is processed by usb_hcd_giveback_urb,
I do not mind an extra indirection.
What would be the right test in usb_hcd_giveback_urb, then?
It looks to me that you want me to use this:
urb_is_for_root_hub(urb) {
     return urb->dev == urb->dev->bus->hcpriv->self.root_hub;
}
This is just ... ewwwww. Can we use pipe for now or do you have
a better idea?
