Yes, pcmcia still survives in form of compactflash, mostly used by
low-powered handhelds etc. That's where ISA survives too.
I agree that supporting PCMCIA is usefull, and that linux should run
on old hardware; but you can see that PCMCIA and APM is in "old
hardware" category, along with ISA, Pentium I CPUs and serial ports.
Linux still tries to support 386 cpus, and its right. However its not
same level of support as modern hardware.
