I gather from DMI info provided by Rob and Jesse that affected machines 
could be determined by dmi_check_system() using these two checks:
   - DMI_SYS_VENDOR contains "TOSHIBA" && DMI_PRODUCT_VERSION contains
     "PS5", i.e. most of Satellite 5xxx, as well as
   - DMI_SYS_VENDOR contains "TOSHIBA" && DMI_PRODUCT_VERSION contains
     "PSM4", i.e. all Satellite M4x.
A few more series are probably affected too.
