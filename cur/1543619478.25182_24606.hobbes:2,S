Ok, as of now, I tried vanilla 2.5.3 and it works.
2.5.2-dj7 breaks instantly on the first truncate call to reiserfs.
I tried to dig up the difference between these 2 kernels but have not found
anything that will change that behaviour yet. And resierfs code is identical.
But dj7 seems to have a lot of modifications in the mm/* and fs/* stuff
compared to 2.5.3
