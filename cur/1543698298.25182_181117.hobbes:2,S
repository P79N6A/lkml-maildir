-test11 is the first release running on that machine.  My older TP600
destroyed its WIndows 95 so I got a replacement.  Compiling a kernel
takes an hour or two, so it is not much fun trying different kernels.

via BIOS, lilo in MBR

The BIOS doesn't tell anything, the setup doesn't have a "cache
enable" or "turbo" entry.

Yes.

Hm, can't say for sure, because it didn't happen again.

I'll see what BIOS I have - it is the latest.  Thanks for the hint anyway.

Is there any way to see what Windows does here?  I only found a manual
enable of the L2cache when using older processors.

That is fine.
For now the system seems to be fine, even when starting from Win2k via
BIOS reboot.  Hmpf.
