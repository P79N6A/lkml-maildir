I didn't know anyone looked at my patch! I am ofcourse happy about it :-)
I switftly looked at 2.6.15-rt17 to see how it turned out. I found one
problem in get_blocked_on(task):
First the task->pi_lock is locked, lock = task->blocked_on->lock, then
task->pi_lock is unlocked. Now lock is used. This is not safe.
Once task->pi_lock is unlocked we can be preempted and wait for a long
while the lock can be freed (if forinstance a driver is unloaded). You
either have to hold task->pi_lock or lock->wait_lock while refering to
lock. Otherwise the lock can be deallocated behind your bag. I assume that
nobody deallocate a lock with waiters.
That was why I had _reversed_ the lock ordering relative to normal in the
original patch: First lock task->pi_lock. Assign lock. Lock
lock->wait_lock. Then unlock task->pi_lock. Now it is safe to refer to
lock. To avoid deadlocks I used _raw_spin_trylock() when locking the 2.
lock.
To make a long story short:

It compiles, but I have not tested it. I can't see why it shouldn't work.
