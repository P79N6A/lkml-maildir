The aren't doing any less than you do. They don't provide a better
maintainer, but neither do you.   Linus and  Andrew don't have that
much more resources than you have.  They have programming skills
and lots of trust in the community.

A sufficiently bad maintainer will also do it.  If lots of submitters send
their patches to andrew in order to get past a dysfunctional maintainer,
then the subsystem effectively is unmaintained.

Well then - create a patch to the MAINTAINERS file that removes this 
maintainer
leaving the position open.  Perhaps you can get that accepted despite the
existing maintainer - *if* you can get most other developers for that
subsystem to add signed-off lines.  It will then be clear that the
community agrees with you. 
However, if the bulk of them thinks the current maintainer is fine, then
it stays that way.  Satisfying everybody is unfortunately not always 
possible.
You can always try submitting your own patches above this maintainer.

Dropping lazy or incompetent maintainers do happen occationally.
But don't let frustration lead to angry emails - all you get that way is 
lost
credibility, that will only make it harder to convince people.
