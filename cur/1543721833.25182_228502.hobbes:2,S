IIRC, actually the first error I got when using the native sparse was that it
couldn't find stdarg.h.
And even the non-native sparse doesn't know about architecture-specific defines
like __mc68000__, causing some code paths being wrong. Guess I have to replace
them by e.g. CONFIG_M68K.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
