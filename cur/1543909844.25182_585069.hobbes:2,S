Yes, but won't be too bad because it works in a sparse way.
1) It will only generate output for resident pages, that normally is
much smaller than the mapped size. Take my shell for example, the
(size:rss) ratio is (7:1)!
wfg ~% cat /proc/$$/smaps |grep Size|sum
sum      50552.000 
avg        777.723 
wfg ~% cat /proc/$$/smaps |grep Rss|sum 
sum       7604.000 
avg        116.985 
2) The page range trick suppresses more output. Look at these lines:

It's interesting to see that the seq_file interface demands some
more programming efforts, and provides this flexibility as well.
3) A 64bit number can be encoded in hex in 8 bytes, no more than its
binary presentation. And often the text string will be much shorter
because of the common small values.
4) String formatting is cheap. Much cheaper than pte/struct page
walkings, and context switches. Not to mention its user friendliness.

This could be a problem. Binary interface is discouraging, which is
good and bad. The good thing about it is that we can safely export
the raw PFN/page flag numbers without upsetting upset normal users. In
this way a possible useful kernel debugging interface can be shipped
everywhere.
If kpagemap is a reasonable kernel debug interface, I do not see the
reason why kpagemap and pmaps cannot coexist :)
