I do too (though I look at 0.001% of the patches you do ;).
This time, I was motivated to actually figure this code out a bit,
as a common way to get to this code is via a cpuset cpu_exclusive
setting, and of late a couple of bugs in earlier versions of this
code had caused me grief.
So I was hoping for more useful patch changelog comments, in my
quest to rise above my newbie ranking in kernel/sched.c code.
