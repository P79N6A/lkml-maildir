If we'd accompany the argument with the patch that changes scsi to use
wq to perform deletion so we don't have deadlock regression in the
kernel he might be more perceptive... He is right about lifetime
issues but this is not strictly lifetime issue as you correctly point
out. Plus, refcounting also bloats the kernel so I don't relly want to
use refcount for every integer I happen to export through sysfs if I
can simply "revoke" access.
