It is being done already. At least, on i386, alloc_thread_info() 
allocates two pages; at the beginning you have the thread info
structure [context and friends]. 
This is called from copy_process(), dup_task_struct(), alloc_thread_info().
However, what you say makes sense, but it'd be kind of difficult to
calculate how much is enough ... maybe, who knows. But the only 
thing you can put in there is stuff that is specific to each thread
(scheduling information, parent/s, childs, siblings, pid maps,
timers? used_math, comm, fsinfo, ipc, etc, etc ...).
Thus, it'd be interesting to collapse all the common stuff in
the task_struct corresponding to a same thread group into a single
one, and move whatever is thread specific out to a thread-specific
structure [alike to thread_info, although I guess you want to keep
thread_info really small for cache performance].
That should save a lot of task_structs when threading and move all
the info to that place you say. It is going to be a lot of work,
though, very kind of 2.7.

Not really - the more bloated, the more cache misses you will have.
There are a lot of fields that don't use all the bits and a lot
of Booleans; it'd make sense to collapse all those into a single
word if possible.

To solve that, you put the structures on the top of the area instead
of at the beginning. That way you are sure the stack cannot overflow
over your (very delicate) data structures, and makes it easier to add
an overflow guard page (as the stack end is at the beginning of a
page).
