Maybe more a matter of taste, or real life problems. I wanted a kernel
with yenta and i82365 built-in, but I need to specify extra_sockes to the
i82365. There is no way to do this unless it is a module. Then I thought,
why not have yenta build-in, and i82365 as a module, and discovered that
that was not possible. I know, I should add a __setup thingie to i82365,
but...
As for taste, the generic pcmcia code is not a driver, and it would make
sense to me to have that support in the kernel, not in a module.
