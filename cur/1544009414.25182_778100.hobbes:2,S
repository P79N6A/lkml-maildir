HI,
I got the information that the maximum kernel size after decompression
is 4M . from  
http://www.simtec.co.uk/products/SWLINUX/files/booting_article.html#d0e416
I knew this information is incorrect in new kernel .
I get the info is the maximum kernel size after decompression is  4x zImage from linux/arch/arm/boot/compressed/head.S .
1. I want to know whether all architecture has similar soft-limit or hard-limit ?
2. Does kernel has hard-limit size of kernel ? 
Thanks Advanced 
Best Regards.
