So slub is using compound pages so that it can locate the head page in
higher-order pages, whereas slab uses per-object (or per-order-0-page?)
metadata for that?
I see four instances of
+	page = virt_to_page(p);
+
+	if (unlikely(PageCompound(page)))
+		page = page->first_page;
A new virt_to_head_page() is needed.
Sigh.  We're seeing rather a lot of churn to accommodate slub.  Do we
actually have any justification for all this?  If we end up deciding to
merge slub and to deprecate then remove slab, what would our reasons have
been?
