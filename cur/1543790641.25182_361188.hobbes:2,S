Subject: [PATCH 1/2] Remove unused list_for_each_safe_rcu() API
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/10/28/379

Hello!
This patch removes the unused list_for_each_safe_rcu() API.  Any out-of-tree
uses of this interface can instead use list_for_each_rcu(), as noted in
the documentation updates.  Builds, passes kernbench and LTP.

+Quick Quiz #4:  Why isn't there a list_for_each_safe_rcu() and
+		a list_for_each_entry_safe_rcu()?
+
+Answer:		They are not needed.  Any place you might be tempted
+		to use list_for_each_safe_rcu(), you should instead use
+		list_for_each_rcu().  Similarly, any place you might
+		want to use list_for_each_entry_safe_rcu() you should
+		instead use list_for_each_entry_rcu().
+
+		To see the reason for this substitution, consider that
+		the whole point of the _safe_ macros is to handle the
+		case where the body of the loop deletes the list
+		entry being examined.  But RCU takes care of this deletion
+		case automatically, since any removed list element cannot
+		be freed until after all RCU read-side critical sections,
+		including the one containing the list macro, have completed.
+		Since RCU provides the safety, there is no need for a
+		special "safe" variant of the list macros.
