Um. Maybe I'm not doing things the 'right way' but I have my mail sent to
go to renec-kernel@zorro.pangea.ca with qmail, but all my posts are going
to say they are from renec@zorro.pangea.ca, which is my 'real' email
address.
Since all my lists come from a different renec-*@wherever, I think the
list needs to recognize that the address I receive on is not the one I
would want to be registered as a sender on.

But not everybody does it that way ;)
