I think Eric did that because the spec makes BUSY look less severe than QUEUE 
FULL.  We can easily treat busy as QUEUE FULL.  That will cause a short delay 
as the cmd goes back into the block queue and gets reissued.

That's a valid flow control response.  Given the variability of queue depths, 
particularly in multi-initiator/FC environments, it's not clear that 
attempting to implement high/low water marks would buy anything.

That depends on the tag philosophy, which is partly what this thread is all 
about.  If you regard tags as simply a transport engine to the device and tend 
to keep the number of tags much less than the number the device could accept, 
then this isn't necessary.
Since this feature is one you particularly want for the aic, send us some code 
and it can probably go in the mid-layer. (or actually, if you want to talk to 
Jens about it, the block layer).

I'm lost here.  We currently implement TCQ with simple tags which have no 
guarantee of execution order in the drive I/O scheduler.  Why would we want to 
bother preserving the order of what will become essentially an unordered queue?
This will become an issue when (or more likely if) journalled fs rely on the 
barrier being implemented down to the medium, and the mid layer does do 
reqeueing in the correct order in that case, except for the tiny race where 
the command following the queue full could be accepted by the device before 
the queue is blocked.

Apart from the TCQ pieces, these are all edge cases which are rarely (if ever) 
seen.  They afflict all drivers and the only one that causes any problems is 
the mid-layer assumption that all devices can accept at least one command.
By not using any of the mid-layer queueing, you've got into a catch-22 
situation where we don't have any bug reports for these problems and you don't 
see them because you don't use the generic infrastructure.
How about I look at fixing the above and you look at using the generic 
infrastructure?
I might even think about how to do dynamic tags in the blk code...
