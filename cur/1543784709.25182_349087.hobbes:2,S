[I have just came back from 3 days horse trip... you'll get replies to
other mails later.]
There's git tree at www.kernel.org/git ... its called linux-z. It
worked for before I got to 2.6.13, but it is now broken (IIRC, maybe
its okay). PCMCIA never worked for me. linux-z is probably good start
for new work. It should have all your patches IIRC.
I started work on battery control, and it does something, but I do not
dare enabling charging juts yet.
