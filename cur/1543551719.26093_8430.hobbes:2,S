Subject: BLKSSZGET change will break fdisk

Hi,
I noticed that behaviour of BLKSSZGET changed between 2.2 and 2.4. One of
the users will be fdisk, as soon as it is compiled with 2.4 kernel
headers, but then fdisk will be no longer usable under 2.2!
My question now is, wouldn't it be better to use a new ioctl (like
BLKHSSZGET) and keep the old behaviour of BLKSSZGET?
bye, Roman
