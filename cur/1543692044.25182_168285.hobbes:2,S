Just FYI, we have lots of ext3 filesystems that are 2TB in size, so I don't
think it is an ext3 problem.  What could be happening though is that when
you mke2fs the filesystem with your IDE problem it wraps writes over 128GB
back to zero and overwrites the superblock so mount doesn't see the ext3
superblock anymore.
Cheers, Andreas
