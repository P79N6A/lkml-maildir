btw., the correct metric would be "real user-side regressions per 
commit" (maybe real regressions per line of code changed), not "number 
of commits". With the latter metric, x86.git is "problematic". For the 
former, it's much less so ;-)
i.e. you should punish buggy trees that affect real testers out there, 
not high-flux trees that by virtue of their flux cause more integration 
work.
