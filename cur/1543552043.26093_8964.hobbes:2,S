Hello all.  The attached patch changes the behavoir of fs/nls/Config.in from:
CONFIG_SMB_FS != n to CONFIG_INET = y && CONFIG_SMB_FS != n.  This is neeed
because if CONFIG_INET isn't set, CONFIG_SMB_FS isn't asked about and
therefor isn't set at all, so CONFIG_NLS is set to y.  My only question about
this patch is if it shouldn't have depended on CONFIG_SMB_NLS_DEFAULT to start
with?  (Maintainer CC'ed).
