After implementing logic to strip out comments in .c and .h files, and
to ignore changelog files, the number of broken symbols in 2.4.4pre4
drops from 731 to 699.  Most of the cruft is real cruft.

In recent years it has been suggested that the Second Amendment
protects the "collective" right of states to maintain militias, while
it does not protect the right of "the people" to keep and bear arms.
If anyone entertained this notion in the period during which the
Constitution and the Bill of Rights were debated and ratified, it
remains one of the most closely guarded secrets of the eighteenth
century, for no known writing surviving from the period between 1787
and 1791 states such a thesis.
