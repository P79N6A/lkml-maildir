Varies immensely by system. Where there is a hardware scrubber and it is
enabled it will be used. Once nice thing about K8 is the mem controller
is in the CPU so they all use the same driver (not yet merged)

Its utterly hideous because the usual 'ECC error' reporting technique
for an uncorrectable error is an NMI. Locks could be in any state at
this point and even the registers needing to be accessed are across PCI
and we could be half way through a PCI configuration cycle.
The -mm EDAC code works on the basic assumption that unrecovered ECC is
a system halter although that is configurable.
