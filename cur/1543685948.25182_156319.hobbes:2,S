Subject: Kernel Panic (NFS, 2.4.2[0-1])
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From /etc/fstab:
p500:/d1/x       /p500/x          nfs         rw,hard,intr,rsize=65536,wsize=65536,nfsvers=3 0 0
A small for loop in bash causes 2.4.20 to panic, and 2.4.21 to have
massive network packet loss.
for i in `seq 1 10`
do
  /usr/bin/time /bin/cp /p500/x/20GB . ; rm -f 20GB; sync; sleep 5
done
I left the box unattended for an hour or two, I return to find the screen
black, and the and caps key and scroll lock key blinking, however the
numlock key was not blinking.
The run before it crashed was:
-rw-r--r--    1 war      wheel        1.4G 2003-08-10 15:25 20GB
I no longer run any binary only modules.
The modules I run are:
war@war:~$ lsmod

war@war:~$
I will once again run this loop and see if I can get it to produce the
same result or similiar behavior.
I have an Intel i875 based motherboard (Abit IC7-G), P4 2.6GHZ C w/HT
enabled.
So far, the only way it seems to die/messup/etc, is doing large file
transfer operations over NFS.
Also, incase you are wondering, I have used memtest86 several times, and
the ram (2GB) (4x512(333 DDR)) ram passes all tests with no errors.
If anyone has any idea what could be wrong, I'd love to hear them...
