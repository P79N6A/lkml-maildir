And one of the arguments I had for making it dependent on EXPERIMENTAL 
instead of enabling it unconditionally was:
- it's less tested (there might be miscompilations in some part of the
  kernel with some supported compilers)
-Os has it's benefits on some systems, so it shouldn't be totally hidden 
under EMBEDDED. OTOH, it's less tested, so only people who know what 
they are doing should use it (EXPERIMENTAL plus help text).
