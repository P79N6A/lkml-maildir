On an 8p 2.6.24-rc2 I see even a 50% regression on tbench SLAB vs. SLUB 
when specifying 8 threads. 
Interestingly nothing changes the performance numbers regardless of 
debugging on or off etc etc. Usually debugging should reduce performance 
but nada. May have something to do with the localhost interface? Something 
is effectively throttling SLUB here.
2.6.23 SLUB	           2159.62 MB/sec
2.6.24-rc2-slab head SLUB  1260.80 MB/sec
2.6.24 SLUB should be faster than 2.6.23 SLUB. Still trying to figure out 
what is going on....
