There is already a flag for kmalloc() to try to ensure the memory is
DMA'able. So the other thing that needs to be done is to maintain a
guaranteed dma'able memory cache (tunable by kernel parameter or perhaps
even sysctl)
I can do simple device drivers etc but deep kernel hacking is beyond me
unfortunately.
