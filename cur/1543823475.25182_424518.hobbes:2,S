Hi,
During communication in between application and megaraid driver via
IOCTL, the system displays messages which are not easy to track down.
Following is one of the messages and same messages with different values
are poping up regularly.
---
Kernel unaligned access to 0xe00000007f3d80dc ip=0xa0000002000373b1
---
I understand the kernel is complaining about the address which is not
aligned and, found the message is coming from function
'ia64_handle_unaligned()' in the arch/ia64/kernel/unaligned.c.
But, I couldn't find who is calling this function and further details of
reasons.
Where should I start to figure out it?
Thank you,
Seokmann
