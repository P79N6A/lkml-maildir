I hope it doesn't.  I use it quite frequently at work.  It's jsut so much
easier to use than installing a bootloader onto a floppy, mounting, copying
the kernel and so forth.
I did this patch which works for me, but only if root=/dev/nfs  It was done
against 2.4.13 or something around there, but it applies with offset to all
newer 2.4 kernels and I believe all 2.5 kernels.
