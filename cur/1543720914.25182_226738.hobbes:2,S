With flush cache range, it should perform exactly the same as a 
traditional flush cache with regards to queueing-related issues.
ATA drives normally used without queueing would be a target for this 
type of proposal.  Hopefully lower-end devices would not have trouble 
implementing flush cache (range).
Moving forward, in ATA TCQ is largely a transitory step to NCQ.
As such, Linux will probably have two methods of implementing barriers, 
the "pre-NCQ" method, and the NCQ method.
The pre-NCQ method most certainly involves heavy flush cache use.
The NCQ method, I presume, would involve almost exclusive use of queued 
FUA commands.  That way the OS knows precisely what has not yet hit the 
platter, on all data writes to disk.  It needs only to wait for queue 
completion before submitting the commit block (sector), also FUA.
