Yes, that's an additional indicator.

So why exactly has to be removed? Is it ugly? Does it make Kconfig worse?
Sorry, but only because it's not used that often, is not enough of a 
reason for me to remove it. If it helps only a little bit to spot the help 
text start easier, it's IMO worth to keep it.
