Not only that, but if you read my blurb, I wonder how even the
non-targetted case can work properly if we ever hit a couple of the code
path in there that either early exit because the elevator returned no
request or the case where we "sleep" a drive to give more time to the
other... I have the feeling that we may "miss" an opportunity to servive
a drive, and thus this drive will stick around with a pending request
not beeing serviced... I reckon those are corner cases, but I feel the
whole thing need some serious revisiting.

Ok. Well, I'm not sure what is the right fix at the moment given the
other issues I described above, but I'm definitely up to doign a proper
fix for 2.6.15 with your help ;)
