I doubt that this can be fixed.
FILE* is user space only in Linux, probably allocated with malloc.
fclose frees the stream structure, there is not much that can be done to
prevent the sigsegv.
So what you are asking for is that malloc should not SIGSEGV on
	FILE* p = malloc(sizeof(FILE));
/* first fclose() */
	p->x=y;
	free(p);
/* second fclose() */
	p->y=z;
	free(p);
Obviously this depends on the malloc implementation - some will sigsegv,
some might ignore the second call, some might fail with an error
message.
I assume that the other unices store a magic number within the stream
structure, but that's ugly and doesn't guarantee an error message: you
replace a 100% sigsegv with a rare race - I prefer the sigsegv.
