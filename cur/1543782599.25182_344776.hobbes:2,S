Most (if not all) web servers can be told to drop all privileges and
run as a normal user. If not, you can use selinux to create a policy
for such processes (IIRC that's what Fedora does).

Use sudo for that, it allows even much finer grained control.

Why would that change anything? You only change a process's UID,
nothing else. You don't change things like resource limits, so a
process started as root with unlimited limits is still allowed to use
those limits. AFAIK setrlimit() can't be used to change resource limits
of other processes.
