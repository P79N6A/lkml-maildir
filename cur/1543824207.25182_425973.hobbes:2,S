Hi,
    I have a general question on operating software RAIDs in linux.
    I am running md RAID in linux 2.6.12 kernel. I observed that the
sync speeds
were always much closer to /proc/sys/dev/raid/speed_limit_min value,
than
/proc/sys/dev/raid/speed_limit_max value. I agree that disk activity
(I/O) and
other system usage will bring down sync speeds. But I want sync speeds
to be
higher at whatever cost. So I thought I will just set max value to
around
500000 and leave the min at 5000. But with idle disk activity and
otherwise
idle system usage, I still see sync speeds around 5300Kb/s only.
So Is the 2.6 kernel designed to sync at speeds closer to min than max?
Please advise.
Please copy on your replies.
Thanks
