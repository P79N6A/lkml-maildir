We can add a function like monotonic_to_bb probably? Nothing else crossed my
mind.

I just copied the text from the ktime_get_ts, but yes, why not.

The same as above, I copied the ktime_get_ts and put it under that. Will doing
the diff against -mm solve this automagically? :)

Ok.

I'll look at that and will see.
