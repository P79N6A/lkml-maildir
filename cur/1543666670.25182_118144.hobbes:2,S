In a normal internet connection you will always get packet loss or
timeouts in the middle of any big transfer.
however as far as the delacks can be reactivated w/o waiting dozen of
packets it's ok.

sure, delacks must be disabled until the ofo queue is empty again.

I see seldom delack timeouts during streming because the streamer simply
waits, the bandwidth of the link is higher than the streamer one

there must be something that forbids it because I get immediate acks
instead.

so is the ack sent elsewhere if this was the third packet and there's a
window advance?
