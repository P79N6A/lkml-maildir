Nono, please note I'm arguing for nothing of the sort. The original 
patch to bus_add_device() to pass up the probe() return was submitted 
with just a "if I do this, things work as I expect. is it correct?" 
question attached. Given that everything uses that same code, it wasn't 
correct. What I am arguing for is that it would be good if the driver 
model provided me the _option_ to fail a registration if the driver 
tells it there are no devices. ie, the flag that I could set that would 
make the driver model interpret an ENODEV from probe() to really mean NODEV.
The current work-around of using drvdata() as a success flag is exactly 
what you say -- ALSA doing it all by itself. This thread specifically 
only started due to Ingo Oeser suggesting that work-around would go into 
platform_device_register_simple()...

I can try and see if I can come up with something sensible I guess. Will 
need time though...
Takashi: anyways, these patches are good to go. Already saw the ISA 
driver ones present in 1.0.11-rc5. I by the way do not see them in the 
ALSA CVS at 
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/alsa/.
 How's that?
Rene.
