They couldn't use tar, cp, cpio, or anything else which relies on copying
a 'whole file'. Not without modifications.
However, I'd imagine that modified versions of these utilities would
become available (or at least, patches to the current sources of
them) some considerable time before anything that made a real use of the
streams was put into general use.
