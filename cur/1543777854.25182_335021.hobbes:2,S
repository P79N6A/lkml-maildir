I use unionfs for this purpose because it avoids copying around the full 
kernel tree. This is also good for applying or rediffing in general, since 
after you unmount the union, the "delta directory" contains only modified 
files and you can use diff -Pdpru 2.6.13-rc1 deltadir to get a PGP - a pretty 
good patchfile. :)
