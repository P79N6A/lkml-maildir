Not exactly....
raid6 has rotating parity drives, for both P and Q (the two different
'parity' blocks).
With one missing device, some Ps, some Qs, and some data would be
missing, and you would definitely get a slowdown trying to generate
some of it.
We could define a raid6 layout that didn't rotate Q.  Then you would
be able to do what you suggest.
However it would then be no different from creating a normal raid5 and
supporting online conversion from raid5 to raid6-with-non-rotating-Q.
This conversion doesn't need an reshaping pass, just a recovery of the
now-missing device.
raid6-with-non-rotating-Q would have similar issues to raid4 - one
drive becomes a hot-spot for writes.  I don't know how much of an
issue this really is though.
