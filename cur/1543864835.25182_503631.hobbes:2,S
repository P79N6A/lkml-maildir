well, this implementation is buggy in at least two ways:
firstly, it allows a circular verification dependency in highres+dyntick 
mode between the jiffies and tsc clocksources.
secondly, verification is not done while the system is booting up:

so we should just go with Thomas' patch:
  clocksource-add-verification-watchdog-helper.patch
which has been based on and tested on actual systems affected by these 
problems.
