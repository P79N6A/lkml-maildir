Yeah, that's wrong, and caused by two patches trying to solve the same
problem. We had users assigning the kset before kobject_init() and users
doing that after it. We moved the kset referencing from kobiect_init to
kobject_add, which introduced the third reference, while we already
added the second one to fix the issues. We could drop one of the patches
in the series, but this is all already gone with the latest changes in
Greg's tree.
