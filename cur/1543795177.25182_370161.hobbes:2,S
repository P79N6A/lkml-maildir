Maybe we can cut the pcp logic back to only put cache warm pages into a
single per_cpu pcp list for the local processor that contains node local 
pages? Return all remote pages and cold pages directly to the buddy lists.
That way we can remove the logic to flush remote pages and remove those 
pcp lists for remote nodes that are mostly empty anyways.
