*shrug* I think you are missing my point but that is OK - we really do
not need to fight over it.
The switch_mm patch touched _core_ bits - code that affects i386 which
works fine now in 2.4-ac.  As 2.4-ac is stable and i386 is working fine,
I want to move changes into it slowly and with testing.
If you object to merging the "broken" sparc64 patch now but concede we
can wait for Ingo's patch, then I agree.  In fact, in light of Ingo's
patch Alan should not merge what I sent.  But my opinion would be to
hold off until the new bits saw some testing in 2.5 ... however trivial
they may be.
