What's the error you get on install? I don't have a problem doing it on
my iBook.
You have to explicitly turn on MII support in 2.6-test; the kconfig option
is CONFIG_MII; it's "Generic Media Independent Interface device support",
the first item under "Ethernet (10 or 100Mbit)". This needs to be modular or
on to use mii-tool, I imagine.
