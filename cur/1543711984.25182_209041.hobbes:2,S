swsusp2 aborts and reads back the kernel and process data, it recovers even
when hitting ESC just before powerdown.

It is _utterly_ unacceptable to fail  during suspend. You might as well take
a sledge hammer to kill the box!
Suspend is a mechanism to suspend the system transparently and
_NOT_EVER_ impairing the system. There can be NO_COMPROMISE and
NO_EXCUSE. I walk out of my office suspending the machine and resuming it
in front of my client it can't ever fail, or am I an idiot to advocate linux?
If I would be willing to accept failure I would not spend my time here and
utilize M$'s  incarnation of an architectural idiocy.

Right, because nobody pays attention. If you step on the brake pedal driving
your car these brakes better work or you may be well worse of than dead
... just in case you ran over a kid...

Worse, I suspend 3 networked machines from a notebook via ssh,
tear out the network cable from the notebook and run out or go to
bed. NFS crossmounts still make me trouble at times...

First we have to agree on what the objectives are, the code will follow.
And eventually one has to combine the superiority of linux with the
simplicity/primitivity of M$, which I am btw still recovering from.
