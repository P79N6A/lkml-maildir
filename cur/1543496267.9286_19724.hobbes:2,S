By default the Intel shuts down (goes into a lower power mode) when it is
idle (the halt-on-idle thing). By default, Cyrix does not but you can get
the set6x86 pacakge in most distributions or your favorite Linux FTP
archive to set the bit in the Cyrix control register to duplicate the
Intel behavior. The CPU will then run much cooler and save your power
supply too.
