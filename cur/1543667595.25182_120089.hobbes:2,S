I did, have you seen add_disk()? Did you notice that more drivers use 
add_disk() than blk_register_region() and that most of the 
blk_register_region() users are legacy drivers?
Which character device has partitions? Even for block devices it will be 
easier to just define MAX_PART_NR and simply use a constant shift to get 
from a partition to the disk.
Please try to keep the problem simple, all examples I've seen so far only 
can be dealt with quite easily. So which problem requires a complex 
(sub)ranges solution?
bye, Roman
