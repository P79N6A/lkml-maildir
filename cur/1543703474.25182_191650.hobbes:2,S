Are these screen positions or offsets into the string for the line? The 
reason I ask is that with a 2-byte character set no char is going to do 
the latter reliably, not only do people run 132 col mode with vt100 
windows, just hitting the "full screen" button with most WM will give 
you >127 columns.
