hello,
i have problems with the new kernel on my old systems.
with kernel 2.2.x it works fine, with kernel 2.4.x (last testet 2.4.29), the system 
hangs after some time (some minutes to some hours).
on new p3-systems (also dual-systems) i don't have this problem.
can you give me some help to solve this problem or i can't update this systems to 
newer kernel.
goodby
