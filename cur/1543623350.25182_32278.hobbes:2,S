I have this same problem, same place (shmem.c line 498). BUG
triggered on calling shmem_writepage. Through interesting
coincidence, I also have had it happen twice. The second time
I noticed that this happened with RAM basically gone, swap
usage at about 20%. I was doing a 'make install'.
2.4.19-pre2-ac2 +rmap12g +preempt,lockbreak +radix tree pagecache
+ a few fixes from 2.4.18-ac3
