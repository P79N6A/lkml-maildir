What is the difference with a kernel implementation? Not by being in-kernel
will it make all the incompatible ways of doing this magically vanish, and
give outstanding performance. Plus handling and maintaining the in-kernel
stuff is _much_ harder than userspace libraries.
I'd go the other way around: Get userspace to agree on a common framework,
make it work in userspace; if (extensive, hopefully) experience shows that
a pure userspace solution has issues that can't be solved except by kernel
assistance, so be it.
