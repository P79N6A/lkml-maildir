Hi,
I've had these patches around for a while, and I'd like to
get rid of them. They could possibly even go in 2.6.13.
I haven't really done performance testing because it is
difficult to get real workloads going that really stress
these things. There are small improvements on things like
tbench on bigger systems, but nothing greatly interesting.
I think on real workloads, things could get more interesting.
Actually, it would be interesting to know how these go on the
_really_ big systems, and whether lock and cacheline contention
in the scheduler is still a problem for them.
