Thanks for doing this work.  Please don't take the implementation criticism as a 
lack of appreciation for the work.  I'd like to see dwrr in the scheduler, but 
I'm skeptical that re-introducing expired runqueues is the most efficient way to 
do it.
Given the inherently controversial nature of scheduler code, particularly that 
which attempts to enforce fairness, perhaps a concise design document would help 
us come to an agreement about what we think the scheduler should do and what 
tradeoffs we're willing to make to do those things.  Do you have a design 
document we could discuss?
