Subject: [PATCH 2.5.5] Conversion of hp100 to new PCI interface
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

	Hi,
	I depend on hp100, so I had to fix it and replace all those
virt_to_bus(). Only tested on a J2585B (PCI Busmaster). Other PCI and
ISA cards are *not* busmaster, so should not be affected. Some EISA
cards may be busmaster, but we would need to track down a tester...
	If the official maintainer doesn't have anything to
add, it would be nice if it could find its way in the kernel...
	Have fun...
	Jean
