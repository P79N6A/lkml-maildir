I see the external drive becoming read-only, although I haven't checked 
the dmesg for the events, since other things in my system generate a 
bunch of output I have to wade through.
New cable, separate power, doesn't do it under 2.6.20-* Fedora or 
2.6.21.x kernel.org kernels.
I'll check the dmesg next time it happens, but I doubt a kernel version 
change would heal the hardware issues you mention.
