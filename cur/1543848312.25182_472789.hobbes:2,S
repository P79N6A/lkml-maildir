Yes, I did. No individual factor triggers the bug (high CPU load, lots of disk 
activity, high network load, etc.) nor does any other combination of factors 
other than what I mentioned before (high network load, some disk activity, 
some CPU load).
Both scp and rsync trigger it reliably, but FTP does not trigger it at all. So 
CPU load (which scp and rsync generates but FTP does not) must be a key part 
of the equation...
Regards,
David.
