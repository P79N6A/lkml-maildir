And there will be native support for all the nifty ATi chips (including
TV tuner, etc.) in future XFree86 releases according to issue 23 of the
german computer magazine c't: apparently ATi has seen the light and
released all technical details on their Rage II, Rage Pro and Rage 128
chips/cards.  Precision Insight is already working  on a Open Source
driver for the Rage 128 with 2D/3D accelleration.  Also there is already
somebody working on a driver for the TV tuner functions.
