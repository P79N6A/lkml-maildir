And how is the merge to be timed anyway? IOW will the manual merging
have to be done by people like Andrew and me, or by David, or by Linus?
(I wanted to set up a 2.6.19"-final" based linux1394-2.6.git branch for
Linus to pull from tomorrow or in the latter half of this week. There
will be conflicts between mine and David's stuff, although nothing
serious. I'm just asking to make it as smooth as possible.)
