Part of the problem with KDE is the QT library underneath it all.  QT 4 is 
supposed to be leaner and faster.  The KDE folks seem to be trying pretty 
hard to reduce bloat whenever possible.  But when you have software that's 
expected to have the kitchen sink, it's especially challenging to reduce the 
footprint while keeping all of the functionality.
I use openbox on my laptop.  It's nothing near KDE in terms of functionality, 
but it also runs reasonably snappy on a Pentium 266, so I can't complain too 
much.
So far I'm pretty glad that the linux kernel developers have resisted putting 
graphics calls and routines into the kernel.  It slows things down a bit, but 
I'd like to think you guys have learned from MS's mistakes.  IMO one of the 
biggest mistakes they ever made was to pollute the NT kernel with the 
graphics subsystem.  That said, FBUI looks like an interesting add-on 
project.
Enough of my off topic ranting...
