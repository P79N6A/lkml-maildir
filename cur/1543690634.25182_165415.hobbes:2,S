This is indeed strange, because in qeth_init_netdev the name is copied
from the net_device to the card structure. Seems like the card->dev_name
is superflous. I'll ask our networking guys.

For 31 bit struct qeth_card has 55808 bytes for 64 bit 64256. We could
allocate it with kmalloc but overall the qeth driver allocates a LOT of
memory with vmalloc. The inbound/outbound queues are quite big and the
qeth_card structure is almost neglectable...
