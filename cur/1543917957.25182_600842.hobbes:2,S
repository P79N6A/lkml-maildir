Hmmm ... this could be the key to this discussion.
Nick - can two sched domains overlap?  And if they do, what does that
mean on any user or application behaviour.
From the cpuset side - this patch handles overlap by joining the 'cpus'
into one sched domain.  If two cpusets with overlapping 'cpus' are both
marked 'sched_load_balance', then this patch forms a single, combined
sched domain.
As best as I can tell, you and I are actually in agreement in the
case that there is no overlap.  If the several cpusets which have
'sched_load_balance' enabled have mutually disjoint 'cpus' (no
overlap), then my patch forms exactly one sched domain for each such
cpuset, having the same 'cpus'.
The issue is the overlapping cases - are overlapping sched domains
allowed, and if so, how do they affect user space?
