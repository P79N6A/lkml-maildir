Right, but from a software viewpoint you'd like to KNOW wether or not
you can depend on tsc continuing to increment or not when the CPU is
powered down. 
If in normal operation you have 5M transistors doing interesting
things, you could keep a few hundred of them active to keep a 20 bit
counter running. (Power up the rest of the counter when a carry
occurs).
