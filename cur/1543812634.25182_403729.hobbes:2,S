There's no point in the rhs of this comparison.  Given that DEBUG_FCALL is
a single bit and that won't be changing, one may as well do
	if (v9fs_debug_level & DEBUG_FCALL) {
Also, those macro names:
#define DEBUG_ERROR		(1<<0)
#define DEBUG_CURRENT		(1<<1)
#define DEBUG_9P	        (1<<2)
#define DEBUG_VFS	        (1<<3)
#define DEBUG_CONV		(1<<4)
#define DEBUG_MUX		(1<<5)
#define DEBUG_TRANS		(1<<6)
#define DEBUG_SLABS	      	(1<<7)
#define DEBUG_FCALL		(1<<8)
are quite poorly chosen.  If someone else were to make a similarly poor
naming choice there would be collisions.
