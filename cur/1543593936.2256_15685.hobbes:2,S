The drivers can't handle it at the moment. I've been talking to many people
about this all hitting this sort of driver problem.
I think the fix is to keep two classes of power management objects and do
the following
	Call each 'nonirq' suspend function
	(aborting if need be)
	cli()
	Call each irq blocked suspend function
	suspend
resume:
	call each irq blocked resume function
	sti();
	call each nonirq resume
That is an easy change set to make and solves a lot of grief
