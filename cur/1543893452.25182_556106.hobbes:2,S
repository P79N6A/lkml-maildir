Agree, that the ideal thing would be to make such changes in the driver
interfaces where in dma_map_{singe|sg} API's are not called in the
interrupt context and/or spinlock held, there by IOMMU drivers are 
free to  block when memory is not available. This seems to be a  
noble goal invloving huge changes and testing beyond the scope of the 
current IOMMU driver. I guess it would be ideal if this gets discussed
and resolved at kernel summit. 
Assuming that we may have to live with the above limitations for a
while, what is the best way to allocate memory in the
dma_map_{single|sg} API's for the IOMMU drivers? (these memory
are required to setup internal IOMMU pagetables etc.)
In the first implementation of ours, we had used mempools api's to 
allocate memory and we were told that mempools with GFP_ATOMIC is
useless and hence in the second implementation we came up with
resource pools ( which is preallocate pools) and again as I understand
the argument is why create another when we have slab allocation which
is similar to this resource pools.
Hence, can I assume that the conclusion of this 
discussion is to use kmem_cache_alloc() functions 
to allocate memory in dma_map_{single|sg} API's?
Again, if dma_map_{single|sg} API's fails due to 
failure to allocate memory, the only thing that can
be done is to panic as this is what few of the other 
IOMMU implementation is doing today. 
Please advice.
Thanks,
Anil
