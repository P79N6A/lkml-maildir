Fine as long as it doesn't need a vma.

I could agree.  I was most concerned about the lack of limit check in
your last patch, allowing malicious code to trigger reads outside of
userspace x86 virtualisation jails which are built using segments.  An
obscure one, to be sure, but userspace assumptions broken by kernel
surprises is not good.
Just checking the standard segments is quite safe :)
Btw, I have a version of the segment code for x86_64 if you would take it.

Personally think the code would be nicer, but opinions vary about my
coding style ;)

You wrote before that it makes a prettier oops.  Does it?  AFAICT the
extra recursion is benign and doesn't change the oops.  Maybe I missed
something.
