Agree. Some time ago I tried to solve this very problem with
dont-rotate-active-list patch
(
http://linuxhacker.ru/~nikita/patches/2.6.12-rc6/2005.06.11/vm_03-dont-rotate-active-list.patch
),
but it had problems on its own.

Yes, basically FIFO for clean file system pages and FIFO-second-chance
for dirty file pages. Very bad.

In my humble opinion VM already has too many mechanisms that are
supposed to help in corner cases, but there is little to do with that,
except for major rewrite.
