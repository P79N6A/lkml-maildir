We can do one way or another. We can ask W1 bus maintainer to
export bus type. Or we can un-"if 0" generic find_bus/bus_find
function.

No, I don't want it at all. But ds2760_battery driver need to find
w1 bus type.
A long time ago in a Galaxy far far away we're used to find_bus
function, then it was removed, and somewhere in the thread I gave
link to, someone suggested to show real user of that function and
post that patch. I've just done that.
So, if you're unwilling to revert that function, please say it
explicitly, and I'll ping w1 folks to export bus type.
I really-really don't care how exactly we should find that
bus stuff.
