Good question ... though "how will it conclude" is also relevant.

Which is, as I pointed out, the wrong response.  Desktoppy
people should be making their tools do more intelligent things
with new USB devices they see ... like updating databases of
broken devices, and configuring *this* system to know that of
the devices it regularly deals with, this handful is broken.
Remember, these are the same users who wouldn't know what an
LKML is (do you plug them into the USB port??) if it bit them.

So you're saying all the distros want to make PM problems worse?
And that with all the other desktoppy stuff they're doing, not one
of them is willing to help make things better?
Pardon me if I want to hear distro vendors agree with you before I
believe that.

Having a laptop drain its battery an hour before it needs to is
also irritating.  (As are the extortionate prices for each model's
unique batteries, but that's a different issue.)
