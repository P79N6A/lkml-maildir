On the subject of MX records, who is supposed to do randomisation of equal
preference records, the DNS server or the MTA? I'm not sure, but it doesn't
seem to happening for me for deliveries from vger:
$ host -t mx loth.demon.co.uk
loth.demon.co.uk        MX      10 punt-1.mail.demon.net
loth.demon.co.uk        MX      10 punt-2.mail.demon.net
$ grep -c '^Received:.*from punt-1' lists/linux-kernel
0
$ grep -c '^Received:.*from punt-2' lists/linux-kernel
