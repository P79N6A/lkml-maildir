Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi,
This series of patches consolidates the x86 suspend and hibernation code.
It does the following:
- move 64-bit hibernation/suspend files to arch/x86/power (under different
  names)
- rename 32-bit files in arch/x86/power in line with the 64-bit files
- separate hibernation-specific 64-bit code from the code used for both
  suspend and hibernation and simplify the Makefile
- fix up comments
Details are in the changelogs.
These patches don't introduce any functional changes.
Please review (and consider for merging if they look good :-)).
Thanks,
Rafael
