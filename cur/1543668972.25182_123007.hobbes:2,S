It is a factory Intel PII/333 with an HSF that fits in Socket 8.
With its 512K full-speed cache it makes a PPro into a half-decent machine.
Too bad they're so rare...

No, same exact machine in _every_ way, just a different kernel.  It is
slow ECC EDO memory, though.

..and that's 2.5 which measures much lower but doesn't seem to be that
slow (still not tested, I'm testing RAID1 patches on 2.4 now.)

3 x 33073H3, RAID1, Abit KT7A-RAID, Tbird 1333, PC133 SDRAM:
Personalities : [raid0] [raid1] 
read_ahead 24 sectors
md2 : active raid1 hdg9[0] hde8[2] hda8[1]
      2409600 blocks [3/3] [UUU]
2.4.21-pre6:
/dev/md2:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.58 seconds =220.69 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  2.71 seconds = 23.62 MB/sec
2.4.20aa1ce1(unreleased):
/dev/md2:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  0.59 seconds =216.95 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  1.67 seconds = 38.32 MB/sec
I have RAID1 patches that give 55% sequential IO improvements on K7 but
they're not showing the same gains on the PPro (<20% so far.)  Kernel,
chipset, CPU and disk controller are all different, though I expected
to get proportional gains on any hardware.
AFAICT hdparm says "suspicious results" when the disk speed is greater
than one-half the buffer speed.  I just got 51.20 and 26.34 on the PPro
with my patches and the message came out again.
