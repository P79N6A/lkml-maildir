Hi,
Is there some documentation on how to access an ide cdrom in 2.6.0*
for converting an app that used ide-scsi and sg devices?
(I'd like to use rpcmgr11.c to unlock my dvd drive. maybe someone
 already ported it to kernel 2.6.*?)
the original source uses:
  fd = open(..., O_RDWR);
write, read and   ioctl(fd, SG_NEXT_CMD_LEN, &cmdlen);
(but the ioctl only on lg drives, mine is a hitachi,
so that shouldn't be necessary).
or will I need ide-scsi to do these things?
Thanks, Andreas
