VIA hardware is not suitable for anything until we _know_ the
truth about what is wrong. VIA is hiding something big.
Simple fix:
0. get lawyer
1. start class-action lawsuit
2. do discovery
3. unseal court records
4. done -- you may drop the case if not settled already
Well, something like that... not a lawyer, etc.
If you have the time and money, go for it. Have fun.
Creative Labs ought to toast VIA over blaming the sound card. :-)
