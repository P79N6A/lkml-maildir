I misunderstood it. In that case, hdx=noautotune (x=[a..d]) would work. 
It disables autotuning the drive, so the ide_dma_check method of DMA
procedure is not called. Eventually Linux doesn't check whether the
drive is DMA capable or not, and use PIO mode for the drive.

Thanks, I know that. My problem is disabling DMA on _certain_ ide devices,
while others remain with DMA enabled. How do you do that?
