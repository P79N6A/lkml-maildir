Well, 2.4.20 does not have driver model, either.

Notebook bios is expected to handle apm -s itself. But most notebooks
get it wrong (and fail to save state of audio or something),
device_suspend() should help that. If it works without that, thats
fine.
Try doing without syslogd.
apm really should stop all processes before going to driver model, or
spinup/spindown/spinup weirdness is well possible. Anyway, this is
driver model, Patrick should know more.
