Correction:
transmitting=transmiting
triggered=tiggered,triggerred
trigging=triggerg

[steven@spc5 linux]$ find . -type f | xargs grep triggerg
./sound/isa/sb/emu8000_callback.c:         for triggerg the voice */
./sound/isa/sb/emu8000_pcm.c:      for triggerg the voice */
./sound/pci/emu10k1/emu10k1_callback.c:    for triggerg the voice */
