Hrm. Do you have specific problems, getting it to run or compile? If so
you can email me privately and I can possibly help you out. Also, the
author of emusic and I hang out on IRC a lot (Efnet, channel #e) as
Chutt and bma, respectively.

Newer versions of esound (>= 0.2.6) have a utility called 'esddsp' that allows
one to run *most* applications with esd.  It won't work with quake games
because it mmap's /dev/dsp directly.  However it will allow you to run
rvplayer, x11amp, xanim, etc...
