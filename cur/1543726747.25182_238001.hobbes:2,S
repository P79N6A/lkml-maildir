We have some results that need interpreting with contest.
mem_load:
Kernel    [runs]	Time	CPU%	Loads	LCPU%	Ratio
2.6.8-rc2      4	78	146.2	94.5	4.7	1.30
2.6.8-rc2t     4	318	40.9	95.2	1.3	5.13
The "load" with mem_load is basically trying to allocate 110% of free 
ram, so the number of "loads" although similar is not a true indication 
of how much ram was handed out to mem_load. What is interesting is that 
since mem_load runs continuously and constantly asks for too much ram it 
seems to be receiving the token most frequently in preference to the cc 
processes which are short lived. I'd say it is quite hard to say 
convincingly that this is bad because the point of this patch is to 
prevent swap thrash.
It would get far more complicated to create a list of tasks trying to 
get the token and refuse to hand it back to the same task until it 
cycled through all the other tasks to prevent this... and I'm not even 
sure that would help since these are all short lived tasks... Any other 
thoughts?
To be honest I dont think this contest result is truly a bad thing...
