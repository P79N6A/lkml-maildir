Subject: [2.6 patch] remove Documentation/smp.txt
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/5/156

After seeing the filename I'd have expected something about the 
implementation of SMP in the Linux kernel - not some notes on kernel 
configuration and building trivialities noone would search at this 
place.

-To set up SMP
-
-Configure the kernel and answer Y to CONFIG_SMP.
-
-If you are using LILO, it is handy to have both SMP and non-SMP
-kernel images on hand. Edit /etc/lilo.conf to create an entry
-for another kernel image called "linux-smp" or something.
-
-The next time you compile the kernel, when running a SMP kernel,
-edit linux/Makefile and change "MAKE=make" to "MAKE=make -jN"
-(where N = number of CPU + 1, or if you have tons of memory/swap
- you can just use "-j" without a number). Feel free to experiment
-with this one.
-
-Of course you should time how long each build takes :-)
-Example:
-   make config
-   time -v sh -c 'make clean install modules modules_install'
-
-If you are using some Compaq MP compliant machines you will need to set
-the operating system in the BIOS settings to "Unixware" - don't ask me
-why Compaqs don't work otherwise.
