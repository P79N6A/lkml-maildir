You still need the scsi code. There are a whole sequence of common, quite
complex and generic functions that the scsi layer handles (in paticular
error handling).
Turning it the right way I up definitely agree with. It should be the driver
calling the scsi code to do bio->scsi request, and to do scsi error
recovery, not vice versa.
There are also some tricky relationships
	queues are per logical unit number
	locking is mostly per controller
	resources are often per controller
