Sorry.  At the time I was trying for a minimal fix to much more
fundamental brain damage.

The core problem at the moment is that the generic code in msi.c
still knows about apics.  So struct irq_chip needs to be pushed
to the individual architectures.  At which point it becomes easy to
ensure we have a proper handle_irq value as we aren't trying to be
impossibly generic.
