According to Philip Rumpf:
	* IO-mapping.txt is out of date
Can the address taken by ioremap() be clarified please?  Is it supposed to
be a PCI address, or a so-called "physical" address (corresponding to the
address on the bus between the CPU and the host bridge, which may have
other devices hung on it)?
On some ARM architectures, physical address != pci addresses.  Therefore,
this is a contention point when people talk about passing "physical"
addresses into ioremap.
