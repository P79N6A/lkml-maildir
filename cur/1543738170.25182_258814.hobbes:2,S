Actually, no.
There's a full-time programmer at PDC working
on the RAID management layer for this, plus all
of the folks there working on the O/S independent
apps in userland for the card.
Perhaps I can get hold of an early snapshot of that
code from them (the chardev driver), and submit that
as a subsequent patch.
So, skipping the EXPORTs for now, how do you guys
feel about the driver ?
Cheers
