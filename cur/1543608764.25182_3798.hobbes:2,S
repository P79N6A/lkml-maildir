I tryed to trace of function request_irq():
I found, that problem is in this code:
--- function setup_irq() from file arch/i386/kernel/irq.c
/* this was setup_x86_irq but it seems pretty generic */
int setup_irq(unsigned int irq, struct irqaction * new)
{
	int shared = 0;
	unsigned long flags;
	struct irqaction *old, **p;
	irq_desc_t *desc = irq_desc + irq;
	/*
	 * Some drivers like serial.c use request_irq() heavily,
	 * so we have to be careful not to interfere with a
	 * running system.
	 */
	if (new->flags & SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM) {
		/*
		 * This function might sleep, we want to call it first,
		 * outside of the atomic block.
		 * Yes, this might clear the entropy pool if the wrong
		 * driver is attempted to be loaded, without actually
		 * installing a new handler, but is this really a problem,
		 * only the sysadmin is able to do this.
		 */
		rand_initialize_irq(irq);
	}
	/*
	 * The following block of code has to be executed atomically
	 */
	spin_lock_irqsave(&desc->lock,flags);
	printk("setup_irq: spin_lock_irqsave()\n");
	p = &desc->action;
	if ((old = *p) != NULL) {
		/* Can't share interrupts unless both agree to */
		if (!(old->flags & new->flags & SA_SHIRQ)) {
			spin_unlock_irqrestore(&desc->lock,flags);
			return -EBUSY;
		}
		/* add new interrupt at end of irq queue */
		do {
			p = &old->next;
			old = *p;
		} while (old);
		shared = 1;
	}
	*p = new;
	if (!shared) {
		desc->depth = 0;
		desc->status &= ~(IRQ_DISABLED | IRQ_AUTODETECT | IRQ_WAITING);
		desc->handler->startup(irq);
		printk("request_irq: desc->handler->startup(irq)\n");
	}
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&desc->lock,flags);
	printk("request_irq: spin_unlock_irqrestore()\n");
	register_irq_proc(irq);
	printk("request_irq: register_irq_proc()\n");
	return 0;
}
--- end of listing
The last message I got from kernel is: 
request_irq: desc->handler->startup(irq)
Then problem is in the spin_unlock_irqrestore()???
Any ideas, recomendations, suggestions?
Sincerely
Jan Marek
