Well then let me peer into my crystal ball:
The vast majority of people will use _NO_ dedicated computer systems,
they happen to be part of the environment: small embedded system tailored
for a specific purpose (like climate control or audio/video decoding)
which will work together over a network.  For those who need all purpose
computing power, they will simply rent them like you might rent a car today.

The point being that Linux is right now used for embedded systems like
MP3 players for your car, IP telephone or climate controller for your house
just because it fits all the requirements: cheap, available and runs on
commodity hardware.  So Linux will be around in 2038 as OS for embedded
systems of all kind.  
Let me point you to one thing: last year a german court ruled that a company
had to fix the environment control system of a computing facility built around
1991 which was not Y2K safe. Why? The court argued that those systems are
typically in use for over 15 years, so that the customer in 1991 could expect
a y2k save system.  True, 2038 is further ahead than 15 years, but...
