Well, IMO there's no such danger.  ;-)  The relevent ACPI change has
been in -mm since 2.6.12-rc1-mm1 and _nobody_ except for me has reported
_any_ problems with it. :-)
OTOH, if the change is kept in -mm, we hopefully will be able to identify
the drivers that need to be converted first, on the basis of the bug reports.
And the testers need not be driven away if the issues they report are fixed
in a timely manner, which is quite simple in this particuar case, because we
know what's potentially broken, we know how to fix it, and the fix is quite not
that complicated.
Greets,
Rafael
