Yes, there is, but that unfortunately does not solve the issue for
configurations where there is also a UDMA capable device on the same
channel. If there was something like ide2=0:nodma,1:dma or some such,
in order to enable/disable dma on a per device basis, instead of a
per-channel basis, then that would also solve the issue.
