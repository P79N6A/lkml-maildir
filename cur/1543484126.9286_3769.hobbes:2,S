Well,
I don't have a 3c529, but being familiar with MCA I took a quick glance at
the 3c529.c probing code and found that it doesn't even come close to doing
proper MCA style detection.  I'll try to patch that up soon.
However, have you tried loading the module and specifying the io address as
follows:
modprobe 3c509 irq=10
This may force it to load only for the card on IRQ 10 and skip the autoprobe
looping.  The autoprobing for MCA would appear to be broken, the ISA code
sets a flag in each card that is found, the MCA probing skips this step and
I don't see any way for it to mark a card as previously detected, which is
why it keeps looping the detection and finally dies.
This driver really needs to do proper MCA detection using the
mca_find_unused_adapter and mca_mark_as_used routines to detect multiple
cards.  If no one else volunteers another solution I'll try to make a patch
tonight.
