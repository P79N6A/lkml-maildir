Someone should add tslib support to the main xorg server then ;-). All
tslib supported devices will then just work...

It does.

tslib does work via the input subsystem for almost every 2.6 kernel
based device I can think of in OpenEmbedded and we made an active effort
to get into that position. The only proprietary interfaces are old 2.4
kernels.

Qt/E 2/3 have a ton of other input issues beside this (e.e keymap
problems) so the lack of merged tslib support is only a minor one and as
you say, patches exist.
IMO, calibration in the kernel would be a backwards step (especially
when tslib can do more besides like filtering and hopefully in the
future rescaling).
