i'm compiling kernel 2.4.0-test11 uder RH7. i've changed the CC= line to use
kgcc, executed "make clean" and "make mrproper". "make menuconfig" and "make
dep" went smoothly. however during the "make modules" process, several
warning messages (shown below) appeared:
{standard input}: Assembler messages:
{standard input}:8: Warning: Ignoring changed section attributes for
.modinfo
pls kindly advise how can i resolve the warning messages, or can i can
safely igonre the warning messages?
thanks.
