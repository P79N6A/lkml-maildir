Does this mean you need to redo the instrumentation and benchmarking?  If
so, please do that and send the numbers along?  There's no particular
urgency on that, but we should do it.
Also, I'd be interested in understanding what the input to the hashing
functions looked like in this testing.  It could be that the new hash just
happens to work well with one particular test's dataset.  Please convince
us otherwise ;)
