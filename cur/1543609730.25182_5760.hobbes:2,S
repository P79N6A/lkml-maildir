sectors = 512 per default
blocks = 1024 per default.
Never said anything else.
Look at the initialization point for the arrays. They all use constants
which you can look up in the kernel headers.
./linux/fs.h:#define BLOCK_SIZE_BITS 10
./linux/fs.h:#define BLOCK_SIZE (1<<BLOCK_SIZE_BITS)
Which means 1024 bytes for blk_size as default value.
