Also, even having a div64 instruction does not eliminate the asm/div64.h 
as it checks for results that are >32-bits and does the right thing. 
For example, letting the x86 do this divide with such a result, results 
in a trap.
This is why we need to be very careful where we use the div_ll_l_rem() 
which accesses just this instruction.
