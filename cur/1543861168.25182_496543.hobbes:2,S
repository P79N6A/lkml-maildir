And does it matter? If you rename a file, tar might skip it no matter of 
hardlink detection (if readdir races with rename, you can read none of the 
names of file, one or both --- all these are possible).
If you have "dir1/a" hardlinked to "dir1/b" and while tar runs you delete 
both "a" and "b" and create totally new files "dir2/c" linked to "dir2/d", 
tar might hardlink both "c" and "d" to "a" and "b".
No one guarantees you sane result of tar or cp -a while changing the tree. 
I don't see how is_samefile() could make it worse.
