I am making a small boot-floppy linux distro with kernel 2.6.11.   The
kernel is so big that I need to load ramdisk from the second floppy
and I don't use initrd.   My problem is the kernel wouldn't prompt to
load ramdisk image.  I tried syslinux, grub and lilo as boot loader
and for syslinux, I put syslinux.cfg as follows:
- --------------
DEFAULT bzImage noinitrd ramdisk_size=10240 ramdisk_start=0
prompt_ramdisk=1 load_ramdisk=1 root=/dev/ram0 disksize=1.44
prompt 1
timeout 50
- ---------------
kernel boots as usual, however it stops without loading ramdisk floppy
saying:
- -----------
Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on
unknown-block(1,0)
- -----------
This error message makes sense because it hasn't loaded ramdisk image
(block(1,0) means /dev/ram0, IMHO).  But in my kernel configuration,
ramdisk is enabled and the default size is 8192kb.  The boot message
says the size of ramdisk is 10240kb, so I guess the kernel recognizes
kernel options.  Then why doesn't prompt for the ramdisk floppy?
I've read syslinux is not compatible with kernel 2.6.something in this
mailing-list archive, tried with grub and lilo with the same kernel
options, but in vain..  so I guess the loader doesn't matter.
Thanks in advance!
