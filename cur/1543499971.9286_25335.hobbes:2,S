I'm going to wait before I comment on this one.
Some of what's going on is a misrepresentation of
current OS theory within acedemic circles, which changes
the context surrounding the message passing thread.
Syscall overhead is an issue, but things in the late 90's
are different now, so folks arguments are rather dated.
I'm going to wait for the IBM guy, to reply first.
