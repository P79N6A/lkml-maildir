There are a number of test tools floating about.  reaim, orasim, osdb, others.
A number of them are fairly crufty and toy-like, but still more useful than
microbenchmarks, and they permit others to evaluate patches and to perform
further optimisation. 
It's in everyone's interest that we get away from a test which has such
dopey restrictions.
