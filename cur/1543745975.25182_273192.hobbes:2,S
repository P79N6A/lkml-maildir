Actually, this is documented gcc behaviour, where a missing true condition 
is substituted with the condition value.
So what the above does is set "tickadj" to 500/HZ _except_ if that 
underflows to zero, in which case tickadj gets the value 1.
IOW, it's the same as
	int tickadj = 500/HZ ? 500/HZ : 1;
except that the short syntax is not only shorter, but it's extremely
convenient in macros etc, because it only evaluates the value once, ie you
can do
	int tickadj = *ptr++ ? : 1;
and it's well-behaved in that it increments the pointer only once.
