Is it the intention for the real kernel headers to be used by userland apps, 
and for linux-libc-headers et-al to be deprecated?
If so, how far down this road are we? I tested a few things recently, out of 
interest;
- recent glibc builds fine with real 2.6.14.2 headers
- x11 cvs won't build without real kernel headers
- net-tools will only build with sanitized headers
