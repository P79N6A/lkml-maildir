I agree with this. However, since this driver cannot be built, and
since the latest modutils will exit badly for unresolved, I strongly
believe that the comx driver should not be offered (disable it in
the Config.in) until it is fixed - 2.4 being a stable kernel.
I had to wrap 'depmod' with a script to ignore failures in order
to get through a full build (which includes the kernel plus a few
extra modules like NVdriver, dc395, lm_sensors).
We have already been through this argument before, it is now up to
Marcelo to decide on the policy here.
