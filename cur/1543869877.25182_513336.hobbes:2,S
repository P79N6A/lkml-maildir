The patches look good. I will add my hotplug changes on the top of
these. 
And yeah, removing the warnings from thaw_processes
sounds like a good thing to me. I was constantly getting warnings like
"Strange, but ksoftirqd/1 was not frozen" when ksoftirqd was created in 
the CPU_UP path from the frozen context! 
I was wondering if freezing the processes created from the
frozen context is a good thing to silence these warnings, but I guess that
would open up some new races.
