Right now, i don't think it is safe to use lockdep with XFS.  We've
just discovered that lockdep can panic the system or cause
use-after-free issues because of the fact that XFS often does not
unlock objects before freeing them. We are working on getting
full lockdep support in XFS, but we are not there yet.
FWIW, this patch might fix the problem you reported.
