There have been several threads on this.
The fix is attached.

# This is a BitKeeper generated patch for the following project:
# Project Name: Linux kernel tree
# This patch format is intended for GNU patch command version 2.5 or higher.
# This patch includes the following deltas:
#	           ChangeSet	1.1483  -> 1.1484 
#	drivers/scsi/scsi_error.c	1.65    -> 1.66   
#
# The following is the BitKeeper ChangeSet Log
# --------------------------------------------
# 03/11/24	jejb@raven.il.steeleye.com	1.1484
# Fix locking problems in scsi_report_bus_reset() causing aic7xxx to hang
# 
# All the users of this function in the SCSI tree call it with the host
# lock held.  With the new list traversal code, it was trying to take
# the lock again to traverse the list.
# 
# Fix it to use the unlocked version of list traversal and modify the
# header comments to make it clear that the lock is expected to be held
# on calling it.
