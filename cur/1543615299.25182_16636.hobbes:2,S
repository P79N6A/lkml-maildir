Don't forget that you have to use preempt-kernel-rml + lock-break-rml to 
achieve the same (more) than the latency patch.
Taken from Robert's page and running it for some weeks, now.

ChangeLog
With the preemptible kernel, the need for explicit scheduling points, like in 
the low-latency patches, are no more. However, since we can not preempt while 
locks are held, we can take a similar model as low-latency and "break" (drop 
and immediately reacquire) locks to improve system response. The trick is 
finding when and where we can safely break the locks (periods of quiescence) 
and how to safely recover. The majority of the lock breaking is in the VM and 
VFS code. This patch is for users with strong system response requirements 
affected by the worst-case latencies caused by long-held locks.
