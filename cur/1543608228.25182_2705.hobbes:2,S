Well not exactly zealots. I test a lot of stuff. In fact, the code
you propose:
	if(++jiffies==0) jiffies_hi++;
... actually works quite well:

It adds only two CPU clock cycles if (iff) the 'C' compiler is
well behaved.
Test code is appended. In the test code, I calculate everything, then
print the results. This is so the 'C' library + system call doesn't
mess up the cache. Note this if you use this as a template to test
other questionable code snippets.
