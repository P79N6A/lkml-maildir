While the above patch works, it seems the underlying causes is that
vmalloc_32() is providing memory above 4Gb on x86-64 which is not what
the driver expects. This same issue came up a few weeks ago with regards
to DRM on radeon 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/1/257
Andi Kleen included a patch to ensure vmalloc_32() returns memory <4Gb
in a patch which is currently in -mm
 
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.21-rc7/2.6.21-rc7-mm2/broken-out/x86_64-mm-vmalloc-32.patch
With this patch applied the current driver appears to work OK. 
Attached is a smaller patch against v4l-dvb which just adds the missing
pci_unmap_sg() call.
