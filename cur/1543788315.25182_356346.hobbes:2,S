It's a theoretical only issue for mainline right now. The only architectures 
using the ACPI code are i386,x86-64,ia64. The first two are ok with 
truncating. The IA64 PSR is longer than 32bit, but unless I'm misreading the 
code they only care about the "i" bit which is also in the lower 32bit (Tony 
can probably confirm/deny) 
Still might be good to clean up, but certainly not a urgent issue.
