I have a dirent->d_type patch which I really should get on with
submitting...  Is anyone actually interested in it?  It really speeds up
this sort of operation.  I have tested it with treescan.
OTOH, the fastest solution of all would be one that's as good as locate
but always up to date.  Why do you think I keep mentioning ways to
propagate "directory changed" information up directory trees?
