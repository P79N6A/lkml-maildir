Ok, I just tried it with a 3GB file transfer, still
held up.  Only thing I see different from what you have is
I have it running on the Thunder 2468, I have one more 7850,
and its just stock 2.4.19.  I think the big factor would be the 2466
vs the 2468 however.  I believe they both have the same chipset.
