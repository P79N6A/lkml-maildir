Ext2 Filesystems I believe have the limit of 2 GB.  Ext3 Extends that Limit to something??
Try making the ext3 filesystem partitions and sharing those.  
I don't know limits on FAT32 or any other filesystem you can share

Hello,
    is maximum file size on SMBFS really 2GB? I cannot create file 
bigger than that.
