Hi folks,
	Does linux 's kernel implement Path MTU discovery in UDP packets (IPv4)? I
runned tcpdump and i saw that TCP packets usind Don't Fragment bit while
UDP packets don't use. Why? I saw that Solaris use Path MTU in UDP packets
too. FreeBSD works like linux in UDP and TCP packets. Thanks and sorry my
poor english!
