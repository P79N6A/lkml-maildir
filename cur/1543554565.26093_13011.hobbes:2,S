No, it should not. I see no CONFIG_VLB in your list above.
CONFIG_EISA should not be there either.
I said that it is very stupid to pose this question to the user
who configures the kernel. There are far too many config variables
already, and nothing in the kernel needs to know the answer.
That EISA basically is ISA, as far as the kernel is concerned.
That zero code depends on the variable. That nothing is gained
by knowing that the system is supposed to be EISA rather than ISA.
[I discussed the very little that we do not do yet, but might do.]
