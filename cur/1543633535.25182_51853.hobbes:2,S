  Should be obvious that if a combination of load and client behaviour
cause the problem you will learn nothing.

  Actually your arguments sound like you have a solution to your problem
and you want everyone to use it even if it doesn't help them. Have you
some emotional tie to SNMP, like being an author?
  There is no overhead unless the config option is selected, which would
be done in a normal kernel source, just as verbose messages, highmem
debugging, singing and dancing SYSREQ, debugging SCSI driver, and many,
many other features. So the argument against load is totally irrelevant.
  I can't see why anyone would be against a feature just because they
don't personally use it, there is so much stuff of specialized use now,
that a it sure sounds like existing practice. I even think that the
implementation is general and could be extended to gather other
per-connection stats which is a big plus in terms of design quality.
