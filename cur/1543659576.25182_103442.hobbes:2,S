Exactly.  If people think that I don't know that replying to RMS
is annoying as hell, they are wrong.  It's definitely annoying, it
annoys me to do it and it annoys you to read it.  On the other hand,
unchallenged false claims tend to become fact and society then accepts
those "facts", just like Richard B. Johnson said.  RMS knows that and
that is exactly what he is trying to do.  
The reality is that the FSF has actually written very little code
themselves, they are trying to claim that anything which is GPLed is
part of "their" system.  That's nonsense, I know it is nonsense because
I've been here every step of the way, I've watched who did what, and
I'm smart enough to go dig into the archives and validate my opinions.
RMS is trying to change history and that should not go unchallenged.
