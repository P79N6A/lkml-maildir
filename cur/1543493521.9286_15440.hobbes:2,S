My assertion was probably based on out of date information or the statements
of someone who was confusing your NCR driver with some other driver. I
looked at the latest NCR driver code and what you say is correct.

It seems that the de4x5 driver is doing this "workaround" incorrectly and
thus hosing the interrupt handler for the second aic7xxx card on that
interrupt. The de4x5 driver should certainly not enable its hack in this
case. My question is, is the de4x5 incorrectly detecting a SA_INTERRUPT irq
handling by the aic7xxx driver, or is the aic7xxx driver incorrectly using
this mode for the second card? I've cc'd this to the aic7xxx list so perhaps
Doug or someone else can comment on this further. If all else fails, I'll
add tons of printk()'s until I get things sorted out. 
I also can't tell if the tulip driver refuses to let me ifconfig the first
port because it can't find the eeprom (quite possible - maybe I'll try
recompiling it with the reverse scan option) or because it can't get an IRQ.

It's perhaps just lucky coincidence that this used to work for older
versions of the aic7xxx driver before this was the default behavior. You're
completely right though: With other drivers a meltdown might occur if
another IRQ happened at a bad time.
