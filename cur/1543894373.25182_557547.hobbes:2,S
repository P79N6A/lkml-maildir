So now you want access to all the software that is installed in their device? 
Could you explain that please? You do have access to the GPL code that they 
used. If you buy one of Google's Search Appliance, are you expecting to allow 
you to make changes to the software that is installed on that device?

Reread what you wrote here and see the complete lack of logic in your 
argument.
Author A are Linux developers who distribute their software under GPL 2, TiVO 
gets the software under the same license and distributes it to their end 
users. They then make the all the changes to the Linux Kernel available to 
their end users under the same terms that they got from the Linux kernel 
developers.
What freedom did they take away?
