'Relative map' implies a constant offset. What you have there is just
a map as relmap could be sparse (which, btw, would have been nice to
have in the example).
map_bitmap violates your naming convention, bitmap_map isn't all that
clear, bitmap_remap is taken, and while it is one-to-one and onto, I
think calling it bitmap_bijection would lose everyone except the
mathematicians. bitmap_onto? bitmap_map_onto? bitmap_map_bitmap_onto?
bitmap_read_my_kernel_doc?
Minor suggestion:
+ * and the n-th bit of @relmap is the m-th set bit of @relmap.
Perhaps s/is the/is also the/, so that the reader doesn't try to
second guess if you accidentally wrote @relmap twice instead of one of
them being @orig.
