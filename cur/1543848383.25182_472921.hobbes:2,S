Well, I just tested hdapsd with mdps and it works - need a relatively high 
threshold, since at the
recommended 15 it tries to park heads if you simply lift the laptop. But 
regarding mouse/keyboard activity
detection, hdapsd simply right out "open failed" kind of messages and keeps 
on working.
I guess it may be a good idea after all to change the sysfs file it to hdaps 
for now.
