"dd if=/dev/hdc of=/dev/null bs=2k count=3" produces the same strace, whether
the DVD-RAM or the SuSE DVD-ROM is inserted. I interpret the fact that the
first read() returns 0 as some lower layer coming to the conclusion that
"/dev/hdc" has length 0. 
The only line that appears in the system logs is
  "VFS: Disk change detected on device ide1(22,0)"
when I change the disks.

I took a closer look at the strace of the "mke2fs ...". The first system call
that fails is
old_mmap(NULL, 504938496, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, 
-1, 0) = -1 ENOMEM
It asks for 481MB, which I simply don't have. (128MB RAM,  256MB swap).
So, this may be unrelated to the kernel, just a quirk of mke2fs to ask for
that much memory.

0                  (with empty tray)
8946816       (with single-sided 4.7GB DVD-RAM)
4875840       (with single-sided 2.6GB DVD-RAM)

Seem to be 512 Byte blocks. Looks OK.

This means "There is hope to get the drive working under Linux"?
Correct me if I am wrong in my interpretations.
There are two mysteries (for me at least) left:
(1) Why does mke2fs need 481MB memory?
(2) Why does the very first read() on /dev/hdc return EOF?
What would you suggest to try next?
