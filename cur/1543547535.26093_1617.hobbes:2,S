  Should have tried to eliminate a few obvious problems like that up front
in writing for the rest of you folks, sorry.
  Booting up a 2.2.x kernel on the same box doesn't have the same
problems.  Problems reaching the DNS server with the ~60 second delay
build up and multiply the problem.
  It seems like a pure 2.2.x works, 2.4.x has a delay with the rest of
the system held constant, and tried on a few machines to boot (two
different NICs so it isn't a problem with one network driver, for
example).
  The one thing that *is* constant is my kernel config.  Nobody else local
seems to be trying 2.4.x at all so I don't have a working template to
start from.
