Christoph,
There had been multiple discussions in the past (as recent as Aug 18,
2006), where we (Paul and CKRM/RG folks) have concluded that cpuset and
resource management are orthogonal features.
cpuset provides "resource isolation", and what we, the resource
management guys want is work-conserving resource control.
cpuset partitions resource and hence the resource that are assigned to a
node is not available for other cpuset, which is not good for "resource
management".
