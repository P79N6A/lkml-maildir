hi all,
Here in my lab, we are developing a device driver for InterPhase 6526,
HP Tachyon based FC card. I try to take QLogicFC as my reference driver.
Of course it's somewhat hard as QLogicFC card seems to have straight
support for SCSI->FCP translation. Instead, the HP Tachyon chip
complexity is less masked by the PCI<->TSI(Tachyon System Interface)
logic.
now the questions:
1) it could be reasonable to create a mid/low layer FC driver
architecture, as for SCSI, couldn't it be ?
I know of "linux/drivers/fc4/*" but it seems too customized for the SUN
card.
2) is it instead meant that FC has to be under the SCSI layer ?
regards.
