So where *does* the big jump from 3 minutes to 29 minutes occur? Are
those numbers on TCP or are they UDP only?
What NIC are you using? From the error logs you showed us, it looked
like it might be a de4x5 driver. Have you tried using the tulip
driver?
Are you using ACPI to set up the hardware? If so, does turning it off
make a difference.
Does 'netstat -s' offer any other hints?
