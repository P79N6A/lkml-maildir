Good point.

True, though we don't really want to kill anything yet: the process
may never need that page again.  Better to let it continue until it
exits, or hits Kirill's check in do_swap_page.  But sure, that's not
going to happen without us making some change here.

Simple as it is, no, I don't like this patch at all.
Getting an error there is all the more reason to proceed
with the swapoff, not to give up and break out of it.
Let me think a little.
CC'ed Richard, since he's also interested in bad swap, and this
reminds me to look at his patches (though he's been concerned with
when the writeout fails, rather than when the readin fails).
