This sounds as if this was a Maxtor?
    Unlike other drives, where cylinder limits only changes the cylinders
    reported, on this drive it also changes the LBA capacity to 66055248.
    I can only assume that the real LBA capacity is then stored
    elsewhere.
You can try and look at the identify data (e.g. in /proc/ide/hdX/identify).
[I wouldnt mind a copy (together with the dmesg info) - have never seen
this disk myself.]
    So, there are two possible solutions.
<ugly hacks deleted>
    Note that the C*H*S is not exactly the full capacity of the drive as
    reported.  My drive has 4982*255*63 = 80035830 reported by EZ-Drive
    while my drive's LBA capacity is 80041248.  So I lose a few sectors.
On a recent 2.3.* you can specify the geometry as 63*16*79406 or as
63*32*39703 and not lose anything. But that was the unimportant question.
Concerning your first question:
So far people's reports have been a bit confused; there is a J46 jumper
and a utility JUMPON.EXE that has a stronger effect than the jumper alone,
but the details are not clear. Some report that the effect of this jumper
is that access past 32.8 GB causes I/O errors.
If this is really true, then nothing can be done. However, if only the
capacity is misreported, then this is a common problem that can be solved
by specifying an explicit geometry on the kernel command line.
(Further information is welcome, so that I can update the last few
