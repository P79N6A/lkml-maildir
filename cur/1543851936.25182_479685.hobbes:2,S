Sure; now I'm far from the afflicted machine, but I'll post dmesg and .config 
for all kernels (I've to use serial console debug for the non working one: 
the non working drive,unfortunately, is needed to have machine up and 
running  :) .). 
I'm pretty sure that the configs between 2.6.18-mm3 and 2.6.19-rcXmmY are the 
same; I've compiled newer kernel using make oldconfig based on 
working .config. But in the last days I've tweaked the configs trying to make 
it work, so I'll start a fresh build to avoid any doubt. I'll do this as soon 
as I'm again near the machine (I've no remote maintenance facility on this 
machine)
