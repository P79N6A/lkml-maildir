What about tricking a setuid program to stat into /auto (/mnt/auto,
/misc, whatever it is called)? then the automounter will act upon a root
request with again possibly unwanted side effects. See how careful a
setuid/full-root program must be in handling userdata including pathnames?
FUSE suddenly makes this more obvious but it is not new.

You mean root versus non-root. or user versus other user I assume. Because
the euid (fsuid) is what matters.
But then: this _is_ already the case for NFS when squash_root is in effect
(what about kerberos et.al?). So there are several reasons to consider
FUSE a nonlocal fs instead of a local one so nothing new there. FUSE could
be used to implement a usable (not perfect) userspace NFS/ftp client.
To require an empty stub to mount FUSE upon makes the whole picture
cleaner: users are only able to extend the namespace _leaf_ nodes for
themselves and processes they can send signals to: setuid programs
which do not fully become root. The existing namespace [nodes] remains
unchanged for everyone.
