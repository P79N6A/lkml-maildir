Hi all,
I am new to linux , hope someone can help me.
While i am reading the source code of the linux system call , i find 
that the system call need to call copy_from_user() to copy the data from 
user space to kernel space before using it . Why not use it directly as 
the system call has got the address ?  Furthermore , how to distinguish 
between user space and kernel space ?
Thx a lot,
TOM
