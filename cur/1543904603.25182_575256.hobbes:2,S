Hi Dmitry,
Thank you for the feedback.
Isn't there a way to tell whether the interrupt came from a different
source? If it is not possible the IRQF_SHARED flag does not seem
appropriate to me. If we return IRQ_HANDLED unconditionally we may end up
preventing the right interrupt handler from executing. Am I missing
something?
