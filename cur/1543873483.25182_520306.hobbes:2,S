Ok, so let me summarize:
There are two kinds of keys on those laptops (for which we are not sure 
about the keycode that it should generate):
* Laptop screen on/off
* Display output selection (for instance: laptop/external/both)
The possible keycodes that we could assign to them:
KEY_SCREEN
KEY_MEDIA
KEY_MODE
KEY_VIDEO
KEY_SWITCHVIDEOMODE
KEY_COMPUTER
KEY_PC
 From the discussion, I had the feeling this association would be the 
less incorrect:
Screen on/off : KEY_SCREEN
Display selection : KEY_SWITCHVIDEOMODE
Is that ok with everyone? If not, please suggest something better ;-)
See you,
Eric
PS: So far, I believe that for all laptops, those keys are just normal 
keys (as opposed to a key which would also do by itself its intended 
action).  At least on a 3020, pressing "screen on/off" doesn't 
automatically switch on/off the screen.
